Three people have died so far and five have been discharged ever since the outbreak.Five of the seven new cases were in Mysore and they have been isolated at designated hospitals in the district. The other two are from Udupi district-- a 35-year-old male with a travel history to Dubai and a 29-year-old male who had travelled to Kerala. Both of them have also been isolated at a designated hospital in Udupi district.At an all-party meeting convened by Chief Minister Yediyruappa in which leaders from across the aisle including the leader of opposition Siddaramiah participated, several key decisions were taken to further contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state.Former CM and senior Congress leader Siddaramiah appealed to the people to seriously follow the lockdown norms to prevent further spread of the virus.After the meeting, CM said all the suggestions given by the opposition have been duly noted. He assured that Kannadigas in other states like Goa would be taken care of, and if they desired, assistance would be provided for them to return.The government also clarified that there was no bar on agricultural activities in the state and adequate insurance cover would be provided to all cops and civil workers involved in combating the threat from the virus and providing essential services.The state government also said that extra precautions have been taken to maintain the supply of food grains. Assuring the opposition and people of the state that there was no shortage of testing kits, medicines or masks, Karnataka government said if necessary, more will be procured.Meanwhile, a case was registered against a manager and the two workers of a supermarket chain in Mysore which did not allow entry to two students from the northeast, thereby discriminating against them. The Commissioner of Police, Mysore, asked people to behave responsibly at the time of this crisis and warned action against offenders.All three staff members of the supermarket chain were taken into custody for interrogation after two Naga students studying at an engineering institute in the city were denied entry into the supermarket and a video of the same went viral.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-govt-and-opposition-come-together-to-fight-covid-19-tally-reaches-83/story-Kp3dAddlEHdZUqoo1TgRXM.html
29-03-2020||India||Migrant labourers freed from isolation centre at Bihar border following chaos||Bihar government on Sunday ordered the release of more than eight hundred migrant labourers who had arrived from Delhi and Lucknow, from eleven isolation centers, after they unleashed mayhem which proved too much for the administration to handle, including threatening with mass suicide if prevented from continuing their journey to their towns and villages.The migrant workers arriving from Delhi and Lucknow had been stopped near state’s border with Uttar Pradesh in Kaimur district and kept in isolation centers, readied at the last minute following a directive from the state to quarantine them upon their arrival.Earlier on Friday, the government had directed officials to let the migrant workers proceed to their respective places after screening them and providing them with food, water and treatment if necessary. But later, a new directive said they should be isolated at the border and not allowed to proceed further.The new order to isolate the migrants led to widespread panic in the absence of testing facilities for Covid-19 and the government was slammed on social media for facilitating conditions for mass community transmission of the deadly virus and thereby endangering the life of denizens.The new order also confused the officials who spent the night arranging for food, housing and isolation facilities for over 3000 migrants. More than 2000 migrants fled the centers after scaling the boundary walls when the policemen standing guard fell asleep in the wee hours.Further chaos and mayhem were witnessed on Sunday morning after the remaining migrants raised a din demanding to be released to go home and hurled abuses at even senior officers.They violated the isolation norms and assembled in groups and complained of a shortage of food and water and threatened to en-masse commit suicide if not released.Situation got out of hand and some migrants vandalized the isolation centres and forced several officials and employees to flee while the remaining surrendered to the situation.The district magistrate (DM) Nawal Kishor Chaudhary and superintendent of police Dilnawaz Ahmad, who had stayed late night at centers making the arrangements, rushed to the spot to pacify the group, but it was in vain.The state government was informed about the dangerous situation following which directions to release them and their safe departure for their respective home district headquarters, was received from Patna, said the DM.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-labourers-freed-from-isolation-centre-at-bihar-border-following-chaos/story-qXS6iGvkoEYsK0LfhN4sBJ.html
29-03-2020||India||Bihar designs mobile app, uses it to track Covid-19 suspects in home quarantine||The Bihar government has designed a mobile application to track Covid-19 suspects who are either under home quarantine or in isolation.Bihar has so far reported 11 cases of coronavirus, which includes one death. Nearly 2,376 people, most with international travel history, have been enrolled for observation since January 26, when the state notified its first Covid-19 suspect. The disaster management department (DMD), which is assisting the state health department in the task, has developed a mobile app for real-time tracking and monitoring of those under observation.“Based on data sourced from other government departments, we have done a quick survey to prepare a management information system (MIS) of all those who have travelled from outside, be it international or domestic travel, to any district, block, panchayat or village. On the basis of travellers’ information, their mobile number, name and address, and their mode of transport, we have prepared an e-dashboard and shared relevant information with our field staff,” Bihar’s DMD principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said.“We have involved Anganwadi sevikas, panchayat sevaks and accredited social health activists (ASHAs) to go and physically check on a daily basis every individual who has been advised quarantine and update their medical condition on the app provided to them either on their mobile phone or tablets provided to them. Every such worker has been assigned 10 houses per day so that they do their job sincerely,” he added.The community workers are also stamping on the reverse side of an individual’s palm indicating the period of quarantine.The DMD has also given them posters, in red colour, to affix on the front wall of every house having a member who has been quarantined. The poster would bear the name of the person quarantined, address, date till which she/he has been quarantined and the total number of members in the house. This has to be filled by the community worker before pasting it, added Amrit.Some house-owners have already begun tearing these posters, fearing social ostracisation.Bihar has taken the 21-day lockdown from March 25 to April 14 and compliance of home quarantine directives very seriously.Darbhanga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Babu Ram has ordered lodging of FIR against one person found to be violating the home quarantine instructions when he inspected seven such households at Motipur village under Bahera police station area on Friday. Efforts to reach Ram proved futile as he did not respond to phone calls or text messages.On March 11, the government ordered that all travellers from seven countries, including Italy, Iran, China, Spain, France, Germany and the Republic of Korea would have to be quarantined for a minimum period of 14 days. This order came into effect for all flights that took off after March 13.India stopped all international commercial passenger aircraft from March 22 and shut operation of its domestic commercial airlines from March 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-designs-mobile-app-uses-it-to-track-covid-19-suspects-in-home-quarantine/story-UOX7zt8DGSXkmbK57adwhJ.html
29-03-2020||India||‘Telangana may be Covid-19 free by April 7 if no new cases emerge’: KCR||Telangana may come out of the Covid-19 pandemic by the end of April first week, provided there are no fresh cases with symptoms of the disease, chief minister K Chandrashekar Rao said on Sunday.Speaking to reporters at Pragati Bhavan after a video-conference with district officials, KCR said all 25,937 people who had been quarantined and were under surveillance by the state medical and health department authorities would be completing their 14-day quarantine period by April 7.“Starting with 1,899 people on Monday, these people would be declared safe in a phased manner every day and by April 7, all of them would be cleared of Covid-19. These quarantined people include foreign returnees, their relatives and close contacts, who had been identified and kept in isolation,” he said.Apart from these quarantined people, the fate of patients who tested positive for Covid-19 and are undergoing treatment in hospitals would also be known.“Till now, 70 people have tested positive for coronavirus, including three new positive cases on Sunday. Of them, one was discharged last week and another 11 patients tested negative after a final round of tests on Sunday. They will be discharged on Monday,” he said.The only person who died due to coronavirus was not actually admitted to the hospital but was brought dead and he had tested positive after death. “So, there are only 58 positive cases in the state at present. Except one 76-year-old man who has other complications, all the remaining are stable and recovering. We hope, they, too, will test negative by April first week and be discharged,” he said.If there are no other positive cases by then, which we are confident of because of closure of the state for international passengers and those from other states, we can say that Telangana will be coronavirus-free,” the chief minister said.KCR, however, cautioned people against being complacent. “We cannot lift the lockdown even if there are no Covid-19 cases in the state by April 7. We shall follow the Central guidelines till everything in the country turns normal,” he said.A survey carried out by the government revealed that there are 3.35 lakh migrant workers organised in 12,436 groups. The government will provide them with 12 kg rice and Rs 500 cash for survival during the lockdown period. “If required, they will be provided cooked meals,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-may-be-covid-19-free-by-april-7-if-no-new-cases-emerge-kcr/story-ezr59z3D2XGpWZPswKqusJ.html
29-03-2020||India||Nine tipplers commit suicide, Kerala mulls resuming supply on prescription||Five tipplers committed suicide on Saturday in Kerala and four in Karnataka apparently due to non-availability of liquor. After the three-week lockdown was announced on March 24, all commercial establishments including liquor shops have been shut down. The state governments have been flooded with reports of people threatening with suicides, violent bouts and withdrawal symptoms from many areas.For instance, a 40-year old hotel employee in Bhalki town of Bidar district in Karnataka committed suicide by jumping into a well in the early hours of Sunday as he could not get his regular supply of alcohol over the last one week. Originally from Kundapur taluk of Udupi, Bhaskar worked as a cook in a hotel and apparently had been showing withdrawal symptoms since the lockdown began. A case has been registered in the matter.Similarly in Kadaba taluk of Dakshina Kannada district, two labourers who worked as rubber tappers, Tommy and Thomas, also killed themselves as they couldn’t get their regular supply of liqour.Speaking to HT on phone, the SHO of Kadaba police station said “They had been working in rubber estates as tappers and both originally hailed from Kollam of Kerala. While one has committed suicide in a nearby pond, the other one hung himself in his room on Saturday morning. We have registered cases in both instances. Both had been apparently agitated over the non-availability of liquor.In another similar case, a watchman called Umesh Hadpad committed suicide by hanging himself in Hosur taluk of Hubli district, again due to non-availability of liqour on Saturday. Another 60-year-old person called Hanumantharayappa of Madhugiri taluk, Tumkur district, slit his throat on Sunday as he was disappointed with the non-availability of alcohol. He has been admitted to a hospital and is said to be recovering. Meanwhile, a Bangalore resident V Manjunath has written a letter to the CM of Karnataka B S Yediyurappa seeking the reopening of liqour stores and promising to maintain social distance while making purchases.Meanwhile, Kerala Government hinted that it might supply liquor to addicted residents if they can produce a doctor’s prescription proving their addiction. Worried about the suicides, the Kerala government has opened more de-addiction counters but this has failed to address tipplers’ woes. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said the government was planning to provide minimum liquor to heavy drinkers if they produce prescriptions to avert suicides and other incidents of tipplers hurting themselves. But his suggestion hasn’t gone down well with the medical fraternity. Both the government doctors and Indian Medical Association (Kerala chapter) on Sunday came down heavily on the government’s proposed move.“It is a dangerous situation. Tipplers will soon flood the government hospitals for certificates. We can’t prescribe liquor for any ills and it is against our medical ethics. Already hospitals are in the thick of Covid threat. We can’t invite more trouble at this juncture,” said Kerala Government Medical Officers (KGMOA) state president Joseph Chacko.The KGMOA has written a letter to Chief Minister requesting him not to take such a decision. The IMA Kerala unit has also criticised the government’s move saying it will create more troubles than solve any. “How can doctors prescribe liquor? We have all along been discouraging people not to take it. Instead of treating them, the government is pushing them towards addiction,” said a senior IMA functionary.It is estimated that Kerala alone has 10 lakh regular drinkers, 2 lakh occasional ones and 50,000 addicted to the brew. Sensing trouble, earlier the government had exempted liquor from the lockdown and pushed it to the list of essentials inviting much criticism from the opposition and prohibition activists. While announcing the opening of outlets, run by the state beverages corporation, the government had set guidelines - no winding queues, customers will have to cover their faces properly, only five people in the queue at a time and they will have to keep a distance of one metre between them. But these instructions had gone for a toss when shutters opened.When chorus for closure strengthened, the Kerala government caved in. But after the closure the government explored many other options like online supply and restricted supply but all fell flat in view of the strict lockdown restrictions.In Karnataka, the ruling BJP’s MLC Ayyanur Manjunath empathised with the tipplers saying that he had heard of the hardships that they were facing because of the lack of availability of their favourite drink. On Saturday, speaking to the media in Shivamoga, Manjunath said, “Without availability of liqour, I am told that several of those habituated to it are behaving in all kinds of manner at their homes. It is unfortunate.”In the early hours of Saturday, miscreants had broken into a liqour shop near RTO office at Gabbur Cross in old Hubballi and made away with liqour worth more than Rs 60,000. Bendigeri police have registered a case and are said to be investigating.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nine-tipplers-commit-suicide-kerala-mulls-resuming-supply-on-prescription/story-cgcwo0TPjV9SjqQHcm9UPM.html
29-03-2020||India||Two army soldiers test positive for Covid-19||Two soldiers, including an army doctor, tested positive for Covid-19 on Sunday at a time the force is taking aggressive measures to tackle the spread of the disease within its ranks, two army officers said on condition of anonymity.While the doctor is a colonel posted at the Kolkata-based Eastern Command hospital, the other soldier is a junior commissioned officer in Dehradun, said the first officer cited above.“Both had history of domestic travel in the first/second week of March. Necessary contact tracing is being done and identified persons have been quarantined. The two affected persons are keeping good health and are stable,” said the second officer cited above.The colonel, 52, travelled from New Delhi to Kolkata by flight on March 17 and showed symptoms of Covid-19 a few days ago after which he was tested and found to be positive. The JCO, who is 47, travelled from Delhi to Jhunjhunu on February 25 and from Jhunjhunu to Chakrata near Dehradun on March 10.He was admitted to a hospital in Chakrata on March 25 after he showed symptoms and shifted to the military hospital in Dehradun on March 26.The two new cases come days after a 34-year-old soldier tested positive for coronavirus in Leh on March 18, becoming the first case in the army. The soldier from Ladakh Scouts has recovered.In an address to soldiers on the Covid-19 outbreak on March 27, army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said it was important for them to stay fit and remain away from coronavirus if they have to help the countrymen in these serious times.Naravane asked them to strictly adhere to a string of preventive measures circulated by the army to stop the spread of the disease. The army has asked its units across the country to strictly adhere to protocols for containing the spread of Covid-19, with guidelines being issued almost every second day reiterating measures to fight the spread of infection.On March 26, Naravane said that the army is undertaking its operational tasks like before and the Covid-19 outbreak has not hit its preparedness. He said that Covid-19 was in the initial stage of impact in India and the country was making concerted efforts to prevent the disease from establishing a firm base.“There are contingency plans in place and spread of Covid-19 will not affect the core efficiency of the army. The temporary phase of postponing our routine activities will soon be overcome by rescheduling them as and when the situation stabilises. As of now our focus will be to combat Covid-19 aggressively,” the chief had said.The army, which is at the forefront of the country’s fight against the pandemic, has taken a raft of preventive measures to stop the spread of the infection within its ranks.These measures include cancellation of all non-essential training, conferences and travel, a freeze on postings and foreign assignments, avoiding any assembly that involves more than 50 personnel, postponing all courses for officers and encouraging personnel to work from home wherever possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-army-soldiers-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-oeKDD1scUIJAk7CbcLhh5J.html
29-03-2020||India||Transportation of all goods and newspaper supply chain exempted from lockdown||The Central government on Sunday clarified that transportation of all goods and not just essential services had been exempted from the lockdown provisions implemented across the country under the Disaster Management Act since Tuesday midnight.The clarification was issued through a home ministry notification which also added newspaper delivery chain among the exceptions to deal with the widespread complaints that newspapers were not being delivered and hawkers were being stopped from movement outside and inside residential areas.“Newspaper delivery supply chain is also allowed under print media,” the order said.The first MHA guidelines detailing the list of services exempted from the lockdown provision had listed print and broadcast media. Today’s clarification made it clear that the delivery chain for newspapers fell in that category and should not be blocked.The government through two amendments to its original lockdown guidelines, had also exempted several farm-sector-related services and transportation of agricultural goods from the lockdown keeping in mind the harvesting season.The letter to the chief secretaries of all states, signed by Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, also clarifies that several hygiene products like soaps, shampoos, detergents, tissue paper, toothpaste, disinfectant etc, also fell into the category of grocery, exempted from the lockdown.“Grocery include hygiene products such as hand washes, soaps, disinfectants, body wash, shampoos, surface cleaners, detergents and tissue papers, toothpastes/oral care, sanitary pads and diapers, battery cells, chargers etc,” the order said.On the issue of the exodus of migrants to their home states, the order reiterates that states can use the funds made available under the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) for food, lodging and quarantine facilities for the stranded migrants and for the workforce which had begun arriving in their respective states.The order also puts a bar on the further movement of migrants from the states where they were employed and directs the state authorities to provide them with shelter, food and treatment in camps created for the purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transportation-of-all-goods-and-newspaper-supply-chain-exempted-from-lockdown/story-4TmxZEpCGsp7rLCnGX5YbK.html
29-03-2020||India||Pakistan uses Covid-19 outbreak to again rake up Kashmir||Pakistan has sought to use the Covid-19 outbreak to rake up Kashmir at different forums, including the UN Security Council, where Islamabad’s recent efforts to highlight the issue have gained no traction.On Sunday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office made public the contents of a letter written by foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi to the UN secretary general and the president of the Security Council on March 9 regarding what he described as the “dire” humanitarian situation in Jammu and Kashmir.In a separate statement, the Foreign Office also called for the release of Kashmiri prisoners and lifting of restrictions in Kashmir in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.There was no immediate response from Indian officials to Qureshi’s letter or the statement. India has maintained that the decision last August to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status is an internal matter. It has also blamed Pakistan for interfering in and supporting terrorism in Kashmir.Pakistan was also criticised by India recently for raising the Kashmir issue during the March 15 video conference of leaders of Saarc states on the pandemic, with officials saying Islamabad had resorted to politicising a humanitarian issue.Pakistan’s Foreign Office said Qureshi’s letter to the UN was in line with the country’s efforts to “continuously highlight the dire human rights and humanitarian situation” in Kashmir. Qureshi contended that India’s actions in Kashmir posed a threat to peace and security in South Asia.Qureshi’s letter “rejected India’s false narrative of ‘normalcy’” in Kashmir and highlighted “intensified ceasefire violations” by Indian forces along the Line of Control (LoC) since December. It also raised the “possibility of India staging a ‘false flag’ operation to divert international attention” from the situation in Kashmir.The letter also highlighted “irresponsible statements” by the Indian leadership and the alleged “change the demographic structure” in the region. It added that durable peace and stability in South Asia would “remain contingent upon a just and lasting solution” of the Kashmir issue.The Foreign Office, in a separate statement, expressed concern at restrictions and detentions in Kashmir, including of Hurriyat leaders, and called on the world community to demand the “lifting of communication restrictions and allowing unfettered access to medical and other essential supplies”.France and other permanent members of the UN Security Council have thwarted efforts by China, acting on behalf of its close ally Pakistan, to raise the Kashmir situation at the world body, most recently in December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-uses-covid-19-outbreak-to-again-rake-up-kashmir/story-2lyWRmRjH60T7pwUExxuEI.html
29-03-2020||India||Covid-19 lockdown: Govt cracks the whip, files FIRs against DTC staffers who carried migrant workers||The Delhi Government on Sunday ordered FIRs against Delhi Transport Corporation staffers who carry unauthorised passengers during the lockdown. Chief Secretary Vijay Dev ordered the police to crack the whip hours after the central government pulled up states for allowing tens of thousands of migrant workers to travel in and out of their states despite the national lockdown.The first FIR was filed minutes later by a police team in east Delhi that had turned back 44 buses between 7 am and 5 pm. All of them had a sticker “Essential Services”, but were carrying migrant voters to locations near the Delhi-UP border.According to a copy of the FIR accessed by Hindustan Times, the conductors had not issued any tickets to the passengers either.“When drivers were asked why are they carrying migrant passengers, that too without issuing any ticket to them, all them told that ‘they had orders from superiors’,” the FIR said. It listed registration numbers of 44 buses.Government officials familiar with the development said a second FIR was being filed on the complaint of another set of police officers.In his order issued minutes earlier, Chief Secretary Vijay Dev ordered FIRs to be filed against officials of the Delhi Transport Corporation if buses are found to be carrying people without government ID cards or other special passes. The city government has been running a skeletal service to ferry people required to maintain essential services.No bus, whether run by DTC or under cluster operations shall ferry any passenger who does not have any Govt ID card/authorised pass… In case any unauthorised passenger is found to be ferried by any DTC/cluster bus, FIR shall be filed against the DTC employees concerned (conductor, driver, depot manager), Vijay Dev said in his 11-point directive to district officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lockdown-govt-cracks-the-whip-files-firs-against-dtc-staffers-who-carried-migrant-workers/story-O3Fuf1azolo0z1op74S4gJ.html

Om Prakash’s family were profoundly relieved when he reached home.They had been praying for his safe return amid the mass migration of workers during the pan-India lockdown due to the coronavirus pandemic.Om Prakash had walked the entire distance with a group of eight migrant workers from Delhi and had spent sleepless nights en route to his destination.“My heart is at peace now. We couldn’t even eat or sleep properly after my son decided to walk home without any money. The only good thing for him was that he was part of a group. We were also scared that the police might assault them,” Bablu Chauhan, Om Prakash’s father said.“There was no option but to leave Delhi immediately on foot as we all lost our jobs and there was no money left with us. Transport services were suspended and the disease posed a threat to our lives,” Om Prakash, a father of three said.“I was more concerned about my old parents and family. At home, at least we are together and can look after each other in case anyone falls sick due to this virus or if there is a situation of starvation,” he added.While leaving Delhi on March 24, a day before the 21-day lockdown was announced by the PM, Om Prakash carried with him some rotis, which he consumed by the time he reached Hapur via Ghaziabad. After that he lived on whatever was offered by generous people on the way.Asked how he would manage if the lockdown continues, Om Prakash said: “I have heard that the government has planned free ration and LPG for all BPL card holders. Besides, we grow some crops on our little field.”Another mason Noor Alam and his three brothers, who were stranded in Gorakhpur without food and money since the lockdown began, managed to reach home to Taryasujan of Kushinagar. This happened after district magistrate Vijyendra Pandian responded to their call for help and got them to board a UPSRTC bus on Saturday evening.They were given lunch packets and screened by health officials. “We are dependent on daily work for survival. And now when there is no work, how will we survive?” asked his father Jabbar Ali, 50, who is suffering from diabetes and seemed relaxed after the return of his three sons.Another native of the village, Shakir Ali, who was among the stranded labourers and returned home to the same village, rued: “I am left with no money, so I have no choice but to borrow from local lenders to keep going.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mason-walks-for-over-800-km-from-delhi-to-be-with-family-amid-covid-19-lockdown-coronavirus-latest-news/story-CENrLYFZqCBIp3HvYhc9UL.html

They will also monitor their areas of ambit daily and are empowered to take decisions, indicating the pace with which the Centre wants these groups to act.

The police urged people to select a grocery shop from the list, order goods worth at least Rs 1,000 and send the order details to the police. The message said the police will pick up their order and deliver at their doorsteps. “We did it to reduce crowding at markets and grocery shops. We roped in rickshaw-pullers, who had gone out of jobs, our staff and civic volunteers. We run 50 broadcasting groups on WhatsApp and spread the message through all members of these groups,” said Amit Shankar Mukherjee, inspector-in-charge of the New Alipore police station.Gradually, other police stations started following. On March 28, the south suburban division of Kolkata police wrote on Twitter, “During #Lockdown all PSs raised hands to help elderly citizens by delivering food, medicine etc. at doorsteps. Don’t hesitate #Dial100.”Less than a year after the Mamata Banerjee government in Bengal suffered a major electoral jolt in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, the extraordinary situation over Covid-19 has offered the state administration an opportunity to reach out to the common people and the administration has swung into action.The state-wide municipal elections, which were slated to be held in April, are expected to take place in May-June. The Assembly elections are due in just about a year.The chief minister has been seen leading the entire battle from the front – attending regular meetings with administrative officers, the private health sector and even opposition parties--aired live on social media, visiting hospitals to boost the confidence of doctors and nursing staff, distributing food at night shelters and to rickshaw-pullers and addressing the people using social media. Coronavirus live updates The administration also played a pro-active role in issues concerning migrant workers. She was the first chief minister to write to counterparts in other states requesting to take care of state’s migrant workers stranded there. Chief secretary Rajiva Sinha spoke to his counterparts in all states to ensure the wellbeing of the migrant workers.In Bengal, when a group of migrant workers got stranded in a district distant from their own, the administration arranged for special buses to ferry them home.The Mamata government has announced free ration to 7.5 crore people (Bengal has a population of 9.13 crore) for six months, Rs 1,000 grant to workers in the unorganised sector and advance payment of two months’ social pension. A chief minister who has often earned criticism for not heeding to anything that the opposition says, Mamata Banerjee was seen accepting most of the proposals given by opposition party leaders during an all-party meeting at the state secretariat.The police proactively provided cooked food, dry food and grains to the poor and arranged ambulances for the ill. When a person informed the police that Bibha Saha, a senior citizen living in Sinthee area of north Kolkata, landed in trouble because her cook was not able to come, the police promptly issued a travel pass for her cook.Click Here for Latest Reports on CoronavirusBesides, the firefighters are sanitizing hospitals and localities, municipalities and panchayats are carrying out awareness campaigns and the health-department staff, along with AASHA workers, are busy keeping a watch on those required to be in-home or institutional isolation.“All fire stations have been asked to spray disinfectants where the public usually gathers such as markets and hospitals. Our men are also making rounds of localities and spreading awareness,” said Jagmohan, director-general of the fire brigade.The role of the administration, the police and the chief minister is earning praise on social media.“The chief minister’s role deserves praise. I cannot remember any other Bengal chief minister, except for our first chief minister Bidhan Chandra Roy, who got engaged with disaster management at such a personal level,” said Biswanath Chakraborty, a professor of political science at Rabindra Bharati University.Political analyst Amal Mukhopadhyay, former principal of Presidency College, said, “Our state government has from the very beginning been very alert and active. The chief minister is actively monitoring the whole situation and advising people on a regular basis. It is good to see the state and Centre are working in smooth coordination,” Even supporters of Left parties and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have praised her on social media.“I may be a staunch opponent of Mamata Banerjee’s politics but I must praise her for dealing with the Covid-19 situation,” BJP supporter and blogger Sabyasachi Bhattacharjee wrote on Facebook. Communist Party of India (Marxist) state secretary Surya Kanta Mishra refused to criticise the government. “The chief minister is trying. The administration has listened to our suggestions. It’s time everybody stood together,” he said.BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh, however, indirectly said that the chief minister was resorting to “showmanship”. “One crore member of our party in Bengal will provide food for free to five crore poor people. But we will not publicise it. We prefer working without the limelight.” Ghosh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-poll-bound-bengal-mamata-leads-from-the-front-in-war-against-covid-19/story-63e0F5rqA98DOtwWFiiXkM.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: 106 new cases, six deaths in last 24 hours, says Health Ministry||The health ministry on Sunday said 106 new COVID-19 cases and six deaths were reported from six states in the last 24 hours.Joint Secretary in the ministry Lav Agarwal said till now, there are 979 confirmed coronavirus cases in the country, including 25 deaths. R Ganga Ketkar of the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) said till Sunday, 34,931 tests were conducted for the contagion. “Capacity utilisation in the ICMR network is around 30 per cent. We have increased the number of laboratories, 113 have been made functional and 47 private laboratories have been given the approval to conduct COVID-19 tests,” he said.Joint Secretary in the Home Ministry Punya Salila Srivastava said employers must be instructed to give full wages to workers on the due date without any deduction for the closed-down period and landlords cannot charge rent for this period.She also said the workers cannot be forced to vacate the premises.“The SPs and DMs will be held personally responsible for its strict implementation,” Srivastava said, referring to the orders issued to stop the mass exodus of migrant workers.She also said that the states were instructed to seal the borders.Agarwal said the ongoing 21-day lockdown has resulted in some behavioural, mental health issues and NIMHANS has launched a toll-free number -- 08046110007 -- for consultation.Asked to provide the number of patients presently on ventilator, he said that data was being monitored at the state level.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-106-new-cases-six-deaths-reported-from-six-states-in-last-24-hours-health-ministry/story-IEZGuoZktzqtx46bS0wRiI.html
29-03-2020||India||Covid-19: There is no one reason for migrant movement, says BJP’s Vinay Sahasrabuddhe||In the wake of widespread criticism from the opposition that the central government didn’t anticipate the movement of workers and was unprepared to handle the situation, a senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader said that party leaders had been tasked to reach out to people with the message to stay put where they are.Following the 21-day lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, there has been an en-mass movement of migrant workers on foot, defying the lockdown, and increasing the risk of Covid-19 spread.BJP national vice president Vinay Sahasrabuddhe, however, said the problem of migrant workers defying the lockdown cannot be attributed to any one reason alone. He said in some places while it is concern about food and safety, in other places, the movement has been caused by the emotional need to be with one’s family.“In Delhi’s Dwarka we were told by a group of people that they do not need money or food, but would feel emotionally secure by being with their family,” he said.A Rajya Sabha MP, Sahasrabuddhe who is also in-charge of Madhya Pradesh, where the BJP recently returned to power, said several states are facing the problem of workers either returning or leaving.“The problem is not uniform, so there cannot be a single solution. For instance, in southern MP in the areas of Chhindwara, Dindori, the workers are mostly farmers who had gone to Maharashtra and are returning. In Bhind, Morena and adjoining areas, it is the transiting worker population travelling between Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh,” he said.Cramped living spaces with minimal amenities that could exacerbate the spread of infection, was also pointed out as a reason for homeward journeys by some, the BJP MP said.Incidentally, on Saturday, a few BJP leaders including the general secretary (organisation) BL Santhosh had blamed the AAP government in Delhi for the migrants leaving the city.“Migrant workers tell on camera that they were told that buses will be there at Anand Vihar. DTC buses drop them to Anand Vihar. Some forces want India to fail when India fights corona. Nation will not forgive them,” he had tweeted.CPI general secretary and Rajya Sabha MP Binoy Viswam also wrote to PM Modi to provide services to the migrants.“While this measure (lockdown) is important to prevent the spread of the virus, there are many sections of people who have not been provided with enough social security measures to cope with the lockdown. A particularly vulnerable section of them are migrant workers who are stranded in places far away from their own homes and villages. Various media outlets from across the country have reported that these migrant workers are being forced to embark on long journeys on foot to reach their villages” Viswam wrote.BJP and RSS cadre have opened community kitchens and are also involved in distribution of sanitation products. But on Sunday, after the Union government instructed states to ramp up measures to prevent the movement of workers and ensure they have food, wage and are not forced to pay rent; the party also stepped up its efforts to allay concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-there-is-no-one-reason-for-migrant-movement-says-bjp-s-vinay-sahasrabuddhe/story-CdjQweC3NHBq5lHUv39pDP.html

29-03-2020||India||‘Corona attack on Bihar’: JD(U) leader slams migrant workers’ exodus||The sudden exodus of migrant labourers, especially from Delhi after the announcement of the 21-day lockdown sparked a blame game among politicians in Bihar which faces a serious challenge of stopping a potential community transmission of coronavirus While some attribute the sudden rush to lack of any source of sustenance for a huge population of daily-wage labourers, others blame it on rumour mongering by vested interests while there are still others view it as part of a “conspiracy” to attack Bihar in this hour of crisis.“This is a kind of coronavirus attack on Bihar. When the Prime Minister has been consistently appealing to the people to stay where they are, it was the responsibility of the state governments concerned to make necessary arrangements for them at camps or whatever they deemed fit to anyhow prevent movement, as even two infected persons could unleash serious trouble for thousands,” said Janata Dal (United) national spokesman KC Tyagi.Follow coronavirus live updates here.On Saturday, Bihar Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had expressed concern about the danger of community transmission at a time when social distancing is the only option to deal with coronavirus. The Bihar government has decided to set up camps in bordering areas to accommodate home-bound migrants for the isolation period.Nitish kumar who is also the JD (U) president said the flow of migrants at this critical time would defeat the very purpose of lockdown,Tyagi said it was unfortunate that despite lockdown and curfew in Delhi, thousands of people were allowed to assemble at Anand Vihar bus station, which should not have been allowed at the first place.“How did they manage to assemble? Why were arrangements not made? The same applies to other states like Haryana, Maharashttra, Gujarat and UP from where trainloads of migrant labourers, left in the lurch, rushed back home. This raises a question mark on human values,” he added.The Aam Admi Party (AAP), on the other hand, blamed it on Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath.“It was Yogiji’s announcement that buses would be made available, which created the commotion. We have been requesting migrants with folded that all arrangements would be made for them. The wife of Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh is herself running a kitchen for over 4000 migrants,” said Ajit Tyagi, OSD of Sanjay Singh who is presently under quarantine.Bihar AAP president Sushil Singh also blamed Adityanath “for announcing on March 26 that buses would be made available for stranded migrants on humanitarian ground and their health condition would also be examined”.Bihar BJP president Dr Sanjay Jaiswal launched a scathing attack on Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal in a Facebook post, comparing him with a ‘demon’. “Yogiji tried to ensure as a human gesture that migrants stranded on road reached their homes in the absence of any facility in Delhi. In any case, they were on road in thousands. Rumours were spreads that 1000 buses would run from Anand Vihar to Uttar Pradesh and AAP workers fanned it in jhuggi-jhopdis,” he added.Jaiswal said the conspiracy had been hatched just to escape from the responsibility of feeding migrants in this critical situation when any gathering could prove disastrous. “While most people are following the call of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, some vested interests are still trying to fish in troubled waters. God will never spare them for this act against humanity,” he said.RJD Rajya Sabha MP Manoj Jha said that the lockdown simply did not factor in the concerns of the poor.“As the images of migrant workers on roads reveal, this lockdown did not take into consideration the concerns and priorities of the poor. The blame game on the chilling images only underline that our policies and priorities are dictated by the elite, which abhors the worldview on subalterns,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/corona-attack-on-bihar-jd-u-leader-slams-migrant-workers-exodus/story-8LZ1VWgIZh7E7lXlIW5sXL.html

Health secretary Matt Hancock and Scotland secretary Alister Jack are among senior figures afflicted by the virus.Johnson says in the letter that the more Britons follow the rules, the fewer lives will be lost and the sooner life can return to normal. But health officials have not ruled out further restrictions during the ongoing three-week lockdown that may last until September.Johnson says: “It has been truly inspirational to see our doctors, nurses and other carers rise magnificently to the needs of the hour. Thousands of retired doctors and nurses are returning to the NHS—and hundreds of thousands of citizens are volunteering to help the most vulnerable.“That is why, at this moment of national emergency, I urge you, please, to stay at home, protect the NHS and save lives.”Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt called on Sunday for mass testing on the lines of that conducted in South Korea and Germany, so that the lockdown period could be shortened. His call was supported by former prime minister Tony Blair.Hunt wrote in The Sunday Telegraph that mass testing gave authorities greater clarity in identifying and containing potential outbreaks: “Where you find it, you can isolate and contain it. And where you don’t, vital services continue to function”.“With mass testing, accompanied by rigorous tracing of every person a Covid-19 patient has been in touch with, you can break the chain of transmission”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/things-will-get-worse-before-getting-better-boris-warns/story-U9WmXEPLCBh92RV3PnOvVP.html

They deploy what is called the ‘Four Es’ approach: engage, explain, encourage and enforce.Soin joined following a request from the National Police Chiefs Council to employers to provide paid leave to special constables, who hold the same powers and responsibilities of a full-time officer and manage the role alongside their normal employment.Soin, who works for communications major Vodafone, said: “I signed up to be a special constable to give a little bit back to my community – and to do my part by helping the people of Leicestershire and Rutland. This global pandemic is a test for us all”.“I’m proud and honoured to be able to stand alongside Leicestershire Police’s frontline officers to ensure everyone stays safe. I work full-time developing software for Vodafone. They support me with my policing duties where they can.”Superintendent Adam Slonecki, who oversees the role of the special constables, added: “Our special constables are stepping up to provide vital support at a time when our regular workforce numbers are compromised by the virus”.“I’m grateful to those people and those businesses who employ special constables across Leicester, Leicestershire and Rutland for supporting their staff and allowing them to help us at such an unprecedented time”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-origin-it-man-turns-uk-cop-to-help-tackle-virus/story-mIN78kg5y6kSKsGdYGnpAJ.html
29-03-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi writes to PM cautioning against the impact of prolonged lockdown||Expressing solidarity with the government’s efforts to tackle the coronavirus pandemic, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, apprehending that the lockdown might have to be extended and cautioning against complete economic shutdown’s disastrous consequences.“The world has been forced to take urgent, immediate measures to contain the rapid spread of the Covid-19 virus and India is currently in the midst of a three-week lockdown. I suspect that the government will eventually extend this even further,” read Rahul Gandhi’s letter.“It is critical for us to understand that India’s conditions are unique. We will be required to take different steps than other large countries, who are following a total lockdown strategy,” he said.“The number of poor people in India who are dependent on a daily income is simply too large for us to unilaterally shut down all economic activity. The consequences of a complete economic shut down will disastrously amplify the death toll arising from the Covid-19 virus.”Gandhi, who has been critical of the government’s handling of the migrant workers’ exodus from different states, reiterated his party’s support to the government on the measures it was taking to tackle the pandemic. “I would like to express to you my solidarity and the solidarity of millions of workers of the Congress party at this time, when our nation is facing an immense humanitarian crisis. We are all doing our utmost to cooperate with the steps, the government is taking to fight the Coronavirus outbreak in India,” he said.The Congress leader called for a nuanced approach by the government to deal with the complex realities of the people across the country.“Our priority must be to protect and isolate the elderly and the vulnerable from the virus and to clearly and strongly communicate to the young, the dangers of proximity to older people,” he said.Rahul Gandhi said a complete lockdown and the resulting shutdown of the economic engine will almost certainly ensure that millions of unemployed youth rush back to their villages, increasing the risk of infecting their parents and the elderly population living there.“This will result in a catastrophic loss of life. We must immediately strengthen the social safety net and use every public resource we have to support and shelter the working poor. Large population centres will require big dedicated hospitals with thousands of beds and ventilators,” he said.“It is critical that we start setting up these structures and manufacturing the equipment that would be required, as fast as is humanly possible. At the same time, we need to dramatically increase the number of tests that we are carrying out to get an accurate picture of the spread of the virus and to contain it,” added Rahul Gandhi.Rahul Gandhi’s letter comes days after his mother and Congress president, Sonia Gandhi, wrote to the Prime Minister pledging her party’s support to contain the spread of coronavirus and its economic fallout.Sonia Gandhi has so far shot off three letters to the Prime Minister – one on daily wage workers, second requesting him to implement her party’s 2019 Lok Sabha poll proposal of ‘Nyay’ or minimum income guarantee scheme and the third seeking transport services for the migrant workers on foot to their homes.Rahul Gandhi had on Saturday criticised the government, alleging that it didn’t have a contingency plan for the migrants who were left without jobs or money and had to leave cities after the announcement of the 21-day nationwide lockdown.“The sudden lockdown has created immense panic and confusion. Factories, small industries and construction sites have closed, tens of thousands of migrant labourers are trying to walk home to their villages and are stranded at various state borders,” the former Congress chief reiterated this in his letter to the Prime Minister.“They are rendered totally vulnerable without their daily wages or access to nutrition and basic services. They are struggling to reach faraway homes and seek refuge. It is important that we help them find shelter and provide them with money directly into their bank accounts to help them tide over the next few months,” he said.Rahul Gandhi also sought a mechanism to help the financial and strategic institutions absorb the impact of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-writes-to-pm-cautioning-against-the-impact-of-prolonged-lockdown/story-QsZl4V4Xu1AFnQWn6QqvwN.html
29-03-2020||India||Covid-19: India pulls out all staff from consulates in Herat, Jalalabad||India has shifted all personnel at its consulates in Herat and Jalalabad to the Afghanistan capital of Kabul because of concerns related to the Covid-19 pandemic, people familiar with developments said on Sunday.The people cited above said on condition of anonymity the decision to move the diplomats and other staff was made because the consulate at Herat is located very close to the border with Iran and the region has seen a massive influx of Afghan refugees and workers from the neighbouring country that has been hit hard by the Coronavirus.It was also felt that the medical facilities in both Herat and Jalalabad were not as good as those available in Kabul, the people said.This is probably the first step taken by the Indian government to relocate its diplomatic staff due to Covid-19-related concerns. It also came in the wake of reports that Islamic State terrorists targeted a Sikh place of worship in Kabul due to the strong security measures at the Indian mission in the Afghan capital.There was no official word on the development from the external affairs ministry. The exact number of personnel involved couldn’t immediately be ascertained.India has four consulates in Afghanistan at Herat, Jalalabad, Kandahar and Mazar-e-Sharif. Herat, the third largest city in Afghanistan, is located a little more than 100km from the border crossing to Iran at Islam Qala.According to the WHO, Iran has so far recorded 32,332 infections and 2,378 deaths while Afghanistan has reported 106 infections and two deaths. Herat has been described as the epicentre of the virus in Afghanistan and experts believe the reported figures for the country do no present an accurate picture.“We fear that Herat will turn into another Wuhan,” Afghan public health minister Ferozuddin Feroz has been quoted as saying by The New York Times. Provincial authorities imposed a lockdown in Herat from Wednesday.The Afghan health ministry has estimated that half of the country’s estimated 34 million people will contract the virus and more than 110,000 could probably die. Experts believe the worst-affected areas will include cities such as Herat and regions along the 921-km border with Iran. The International Organisation for Migration (IMO) has said more than 115,000 Afghans returned from Iran between March 8 and 21.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-india-pulls-out-all-staff-from-consulates-in-herat-and-jalalabad/story-KiHkJxSE63fCWDnoUeJPBN.html

29-03-2020||India||Kerala begins rapid test pilot project to rein in coronavirus||Kerala which was the first state to report the coronavirus pandemic in the country began a pilot project of rapid tests that will help detect the virus quickly and curb its spread effectively as Indian grapples to stop the possible onset of community transmission. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Saturday gave the go ahead for the rapid tests.The pilot project will be carried out in two districts, worst-hit Kasargod and Pathanamthitta, health officials said.One hundred and eighty two people have tested positive for coronavirus so far. Seventeen of them have been released after recovery while one person has died.Follow coronavirus live updates here.Health experts say the rapid test which involves blood samples instead of swab sample of the patient, is quick and much cheaper with greater reach but its results are not final. In the new test, results can be available in 45 minutes to 2 hours, instead of present 24 to 36 hours schedule. Rapid test cost between Rs 500 to Rs 1000 and is much cheaper than the present testing method that cost between Rs 3500 to 5000. Experts say in rapid tests, blood samples can be taken by a nurse unlike swab which is usually collected by an expert.They say in suspected cases blood can be taken at the bedside unlike the swab collection which requires closed enclosure and other strict requirements. Tests can be done massively in an area that reported widespread acute respiratory infections and it is good for health professionals and other high-risk groups who can keep a regular check of their health condition.“This can’t be used as a primary diagnostic test. It can be used to detect prevalence of the virus in a limited manner. There are chances of person in incubation period being tested positive. So positive cases will have to be reconfirmed by taking swab samples again. But after rapid tests we can isolate possible carriers quickly,” said Dr Amar Fettle, state nodal officer for infectious diseases.“We have to go by the WHO guideline of test, test, test. We have been telling the government for quite some time. Rapid tests can help increase our surveillance and spot new cases outside the pool of quarantined and imported ones. It is high time the state to step up its medial infrastructure,” said Dr Sreejth N Kumar, a senior IMA functionary and health activist.Experts say the state is entering the next phase of surveillance against a possible community spread of the virus. They say when people started testing positive outside the quarantined pool - other than persons with travel history and their primary and secondary contacts - it will be the indication of community transmission. In Kerala at least two such cases have come to light. Unlike the affected countries like US, UK and Italy where cases exploded in the community quickly, Kerala can redraw its strategies by closely monitoring the ground situation, experts say.The state health department has released an interim treatment guideline to deal with Covid-19 patients. According to the guideline, patients have been categorized into three segments - A to C- depending various stages of infection. The government is also ramping up efforts to boost medical infrastructure. The government has approached many including premier space research unit of the country, Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre, for ventilators and reclining beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-begins-rapid-test-pilot-project-to-rein-in-coronavirus/story-CjQFEI0tMlZqhfkoZo3eRK.html

29-03-2020||India||Unreal spaces, scenes as UK prepares for an extended lockdown||March may well be remembered as the month that changed everything in the UK and elsewhere, when notions of normalcy changed from the first week to the last: the trademark charm of Prime Minister Boris Johnson vanished by the day, until he warned of a long haul.Down with coronavirus, time-lapse images of Johnson at daily briefings over the month reflect the new normal: a country fast coming to terms with the new normal as the pandemic sucked life out of buzzing public spaces but triggered outbreaks of altruism and goodwill.Johnson announced the three-week lockdown on March 23 and harped on the core message across various media: Stay at home. But on Sunday he also warned Britons to be prepared for a long haul, of things getting worse in the coming days before they get better.Unreal scenes of deserted popular London public spaces coexist with others at the micro level of people exchanging furtive glances and smiling sheepishly; people being mugged for toilet rolls; and symbols of British culture such as pubs and theatres shut until further notice.The lockdown, unprecedented in British living memory, has prompted new ways of dealing with restrictions and social distancing, which most admit are necessary. One Briton on a stroll by the river had this note pasted on his back: ‘Healthy, but isolating, pass wide’.Britons are allowed out of homes only for one form of exercise (walk, run) but at some distance from others; for essential shopping; or for work that cannot be done from home (mainly workers in essential services). The restrictions also triggered painful memories.“We are coping but this reminds me of Uganda, when Idi Amin imposed curfew and conditions worsened, and we had to leave and come to the UK. At least this lockdown is better: there is threat to life but not from being shot by Amin’s police”, says Leicester-based Trisha Hazarika.Her husband, Prabin Hazarika, brother of the iconic singer-music producer Bhupen Hazarika, is strictly home-bound, closely following developments. She adds: “I try to remain active in the garden and keep in touch with family across the globe on social media.”Writer Mihir Bose, a long-time London resident, says social distancing is the main problem, but adds that elderly people have discovered the benefits of social media and video-conferencing that ensure connectivity in the time of isolation.“The other night when my wife and I were on our daily walk I suggested that in order to make sure we are not near others I would follow what English footballers do. When one of their team mates who has the ball is about to be tackled by an opposition player they say, ‘Man On’, to make the player aware of the danger he is facing. The player concerned then takes evasive action to make sure he does not lose the ball. So as my wife and I walked down side streets near our home we kept saying to each other ‘Man On’ or ‘Woman On’ and made sure we either crossed the road or went wide on the pavement so that we kept two metres apart,” Bose said.In London, usually buzzing areas such as Oxford Street, Piccadilly and Marble Arch wear a deserted look, except for the movement of ambulances, police and some runners in Hyde Park. Many self-help groups have come up on social media.The government’s call for 250,000 volunteers to help with non-medical tasks in the National Health Service received prompt response, with over 500,000 signing up within 24 hours, described as ‘an outbreak of altruism’. The target has now been raised to 750,000.Charity organisations such as Khalsa Aid are helping deliver groceries and food to homes, particularly to the elderly, many of whom live alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unreal-spaces-scenes-as-uk-prepares-for-an-extended-lockdown/story-OyodHXZZJztiZioIsDoBcK.html
29-03-2020||India||Covid-19:Migrant workers headed home to first spend 14 days in govt-run quarantine: Centre||The Centre on Sunday ordered state governments to place the thousands of migrant workers who are heading home in state-run quarantine facilities for 14 days to ensure that they do not take the coronavirus disease home. Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba and Home Secretary , who held a meeting with top bureaucrats of states, said there had been movement of migrant workers in some parts of the country.For the future, Gauba told the states to strictly enforce the lockdown and seal the borders. As for the migrant workers who are already on their way home, the Centre has ordered state governments to place all of them under government-run quarantine facilities so that they do not spread the coronavirus disease, or Covid-19.“District Magistrates and Superintendents of Police would be held personally responsible for enforcement of directions issued to them under the Disaster Management Act,” a central government statement said.People familiar with the developments said this warning was aimed at sending a clear message to DMs and SPs that the ball was in their court to set systems in place to ensure that the migrant workers were kept in isolation and to make arrangements for their stay and lodging for the quarantine period.“Detailed instructions on monitoring of such persons during quarantine have been issued to states,” the statement said.Migrant workers, many of them daily wage earners have lost work and means of sustenance, in cities. There have been reports from many parts of the country how some of them had marched back home in the absence of public transport. Yesterday, tens of thousands of them reached the Delhi-Uttar Pradesh border in east Delhi after the Yogi Adityanath government made arrangements for their travel.As images of thousands of workers crowding the bus stations were beamed on television through Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had even dialled Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal to take steps. Kejriwal told the PM that he had appealed to them to stay back and promised to take care of their needs but it hadn’t worked.The home ministry, simultaneously, asked all states and Union territories to take immediate steps to provide temporary accommodation, food, clothing and medical care to homeless people and migrant workers stranded due to the lockdown.The states were also allowed to tap the State Disaster Response Fund to pay for temporary accommodation, food and medical care of the migrants during the three-week lockdown.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who focused on the challenges posed by the disease, did not directly mention the migrant workers but underscored that people should not be under any misconception that they had to adhere to the lockdown for someone else’s sake but their own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-travelling-during-covid-19-lockdown-to-be-in-quarantine-for-14-days-centre-to-states/story-6YMTFw5gADiDMdgGQqNLaI.html

In his monthly radio address, ‘Mann Ki Baat’, the prime minister began by saying that these were decisions no one would want to take and because of which the people were facing many difficulties.Referring to the poorer sections, PM Modi said that they may be wondering what kind of a prime minister would have them face problems.“I specially ask for their forgiveness. There may be others who may be questioning the decision to implement a lockdown. I understand your troubles. But there was no other way to protect a country of 1.3 billion such as India from the dangerous effects of coronavirus. The fight against corona is one between life and death and we have to win it,” Modi said. Watch: Social distance does not mean emotional distance’: PM Modi on Mann ki BaatAfter witnessing the situation in other parts of the world, a lockdown seemed the only option available, he explained.“You and your family have to be kept safe. I apologise for the difficulties you have faced,” Modi said.In his 35-minute address, Modi said coronavirus was neither bound by geography nor did it limit itself to a social segment or weather condition.Also Read: Covid-19 cases in India cross 1,000 mark; thousands on streetsThe number of coronavirus patients can increase exponentially and the health services in some other countries had already crumbled under its weight, Modi said. It is a challenge to the entire world and entire humanity has to come together on this, he said.The prime minister’s comments at a time when many have highlighted the problems faced by migrant workers who found themselves out of work due to the lockdown, also faced serious problems making ends meet. Opposition leaders have also attacked the government for being unprepared to address the needs of the poor during the lockdown.Also Read: Community spread of Covid-19 in India? Experts, government differ“Some feel they are adhering to the lockdown to save others,” he said adding that this was not correct. If lockdown rules were not followed, it would be difficult for anyone to escape the disease, Modi said, asking people not to be under the misconception that the lockdown was meant to protect someone else.“It is to protect you… your family,” he said, a message designed to convince people to adhere to the restrictions for their own sake.Modi also said that he had come to know of some instances where people were unkind to those quarantined. He said this was not desirable as these people were staying in isolation to keep others safe.“I have come to know of instances where those suspected of being infected or under home quarantine, have had to face unkind behaviour. I am deeply pained by such instances. This is unfortunate. In the circumstances, we only have to maintain social distance and not emotional or human distance. Such people are not criminals but victims of the virus who have quarantined themselves to save others,” Modi said.He added that there was no need to be unkind to any such person but to treat them with empathy.One of the survivors to whom the prime minister spoke, Shriram, also said that there should be no stigma attached to quarantine.Social distancing does not mean emotional or human distancing. He also spoke to a family from Agra which had multiple members who acquired the infection. Modi said the family recovered because they did not panic but took the right steps at the right time.One of the doctors, Nitesh Gupta, told the prime minister that often patients are in a state of panic but gain confidence once counseled and when they show signs of improvement.Modi also thanked the medicos and said they reminded him of Acharya Charak’s couplet that the best physicians work not for money but the well being of the patient. Those in the medical profession were fighting in the battle-mode, he said.He also saluted the nurses adding the world was celebrating their contribution in 2020 as the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife.Modi said those who ensure electricity, water, daily supplies, necessities, banking, internet connections and even TV broadcasts in these difficult times, are real heroes.The more we thank them is less, he added requesting all these workers to take safety measures. The prime minister also asked people to look after the poor.He also saluted the nurses adding the world was celebrating their contribution in 2020 as the International Year of the Nurse and the Midwife. Modi said those who ensure electricity, water, daily supplies, necessities, banking, internet connections and even TV broadcasts in these difficult times, are real heroes. The prime minister said the country could not thank them enough for stepping out for the sake of others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mann-ki-baat-pm-modi-apologises-for-lockdown-blues-says-believe-people-will-forgive-me/story-mt0J6BLt5qKACipjooY5rK.html

Therefore, action must be taken against him, said the complaint.Following this, Chadha was booked at the sector 20 police station under sections 500 (defamation), 505 (2) (promoting enmity hatred or ill-will between classes) and section 66 (offensive messages through computer or phone) of the IT Act.While senior officer of Noida police could not be reached for a comment, the station house officer of sector 20 police station confirmed that an FIR has been registered.“We will take necessary legal action following a thorough investigation,” said RK Singh, SHO.AAP MLA Raghav Chadha did not comment on the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-against-aap-s-raghav-chadha-for-tweet-against-up-cm/story-aCDKycPD2XoJ3yawVMCpzN.html

29-03-2020||India||Quarantine’s history is centuries old; it works but leaves scars||To beat the Covid-19 pandemic, India has imposed a tight curfew on its 1.3 billion people. Lockdowns elsewhere seem unprecedented. Yet quarantine as a medical strategy is centuries old. Evidence shows it works, but imposes long-term costs, according to a wide variety of literature reviewed by HT.From the time of the Black Death in the mid-1300s and the first outbreaks of cholera in recorded history to the 1918 influenza pandemic, quarantines have always been a form of public-health response to pandemics as far back in history as one could go (The Black Death, D Cohen 1347–1351; https://amzn.to/2xtKIxW). There’s evidence that quarantine helped to shorten the first influenza pandemic of the 21st century: the 2009 influenza H1N1 outbreak (https://bit.ly/3buYTS4), mainly by preventing more people from getting it.Italy had, at the time of going to print, 9,134 Covid-19 deaths. Italians have historically paid a high price to pandemics. Earliest forms of quarantine were, not surprisingly, born in Italy.Quarantine comes from the Italian “quaranta,” denoting “obligatory means of separating persons”, according to the US Centres for Disease Control.The Back Death or the Great Bubonic Plague emerged first in Italy. It was the most devastating plague in history, decimating nearly 200 million, according to medical historian Cohen’s book mentioned above. The plague was thought to have broken out first among sailors arriving in Sicily (Mafart B, Perret JL. History of the Concept of Quarantine; https://bit.ly/33TMIM7). The contagion spread like wildfire in Florence, Venice and Genoa. That’s when organised quarantine first took shape. “The epidemic had abated but not disappeared; outbreaks of pneumonic and septicemic plague occurred in different cities during the next 350 years,” according to a research article, “Lessons from the History of Quarantine”, by Eugenia Tognotti, professor of the history of medicine in Italy’s University of Sassari. According to the author, the first instance of an organised quarantine as a state-led strategy was “first introduced in 1377 in Dubrovnik on Croatia’s Dalmatian Coast”. “City-states prevented strangers from entering their cities, particularly, merchants and minority groups, such as Jews and persons with leprosy.” At the time, 40 days of isolation was thought necessary.Yellow fever in ports of France, Spain and Italy by the turn of the 18th century forced governments to use quarantine again. The initial response to the first waves of cholera outbreaks was essentially physical separation (Cholera 1832: The Social Response to an Epidemic by RJ Morris, https://bit.ly/39rTB8o). With medical advances, some believed that quarantines would no longer be necessary until the catastrophic 1918 influenza pandemic struck the human race in three waves between 1918 and 1919. Quarantine was back. The emergence of the SARS in 2003 brought massive lockdowns in the early 21st century. SARS set off in Guangdong Province, China. Likewise, MERS too necessitated quarantine measures.There’s strong evidence to show quarantine works to stop the spread of communicable diseases. Hubei is proof enough, experts say. Mass quarantine resulted in a sharp fall in Covid-19 cases there from an average 1,693 cases a day in early February to 36 cases on March 8 (https://bit.ly/2JiVOsn). The social and economic costs can be devastating. Lockdowns hurt livelihood, push nations into deep poverty and can leave governments under massive piles of debt. It can also have lasting psychological impacts. ‘The Lancet’ published evidence from five studies that compared “psychological outcomes for people quarantined with those not quarantined”. Those quarantined were found “likely” to report exhaustion, detachment from others, insomnia, poor concentration, etc., (https://bit.ly/3dErcPN). WHO recommends that the extent of quarantine should not exceed the level of threat to public health. As technologies keep us virtually connected, home quarantines are no longer the dreary confinement they historically used to be. https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/19/2/12-0312_article#r40)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quarantine-as-a-strategy-works-but-leaves-scars/story-gZPbIlrIzARxyQ9yjVL6fI.html

Senior health officials of the district have tagged the incident as ‘worrisome’ because of the large number of people involved.Among those who attended the marriage were four of the groom’s father’s friends who came from the UK and Singapore. There were guests from Odisha, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand too.Follow coronavirus live updates here.The first one to be detected with the disease was a 66-year-old man. He tested positive on March 25 and is presently admitted in a private hospital in east Kolkata in a critical condition. Following this, at least 13 people, from three families, who had come in touch with him, were kept in the government’s isolation facilities. Of them, two persons, the 56-year-old mother of the groom and a 76-year-old aunt of her, tested positive for Covid-19 on March 28. The 76-year-old woman is a resident of Narendrapur in South 24 Parganas.Health officials are worried about how the 66-year-old man contracted coronavirus. “It’s worrisome because the groom’s father, a homoeopathy doctor at Egra town in West Midnapore district, has categorically told us that the 66-year-old who was the first to be tested positive did not come in contact with his friends who came from abroad,” said a health official of East Midnapore district.Also read: Coronavirus update: Has Covid-19 entered Stage 3? Experts, government disagreeHealth officials are yet to track down the source of the spread of the virus. The groom’s father is also in isolation. “We had sent swab samples of 13 people to government laboratories. Two have tested positive while others have tested negative. We will send more samples for tests if other show any kind of symptoms,” said a government official. District chief medical officer of health Nitai Chandra Mandal said that a list of invitees was collected from the host family on March 26 and people are being tracked down.“A special health camp was set up and more than 500 people who attended the reception have been screened in the camp and in other hospitals. As of now they have not shown any symptoms. But they have been asked to stay in home isolation as a precautionary measure,” said a senior district official.After attending the reception, the 66-year-old man had spent two nights at a hotel in the coastal town of Digha. The hotel has been sealed and its staff sent on home isolation. It was at this hotel that he fell ill on March 18. There were at least 34 people in that hotel on that day. All of them have been contacted and asked to quarantine themselves at home.More than 35,000 people are presently in home quarantine across the state till now. The 66-year-old man spent another four days during his illness at the home of his relative, the homeopathy doctor, in Egra town before being hospitalised in Kolkata.A second hotel at Egra town where the 66-year-old man and his family had stayed from March 12 to 16 has also been sealed and sanitized.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-marriage-ceremony-that-turned-into-a-covid-19-hotspot-in-bengal/story-mpePSfwUH4EhaXqIXnODZN.html

The number of cases on Saturday was the highest in the Union territory for a single day. “Sad start to the day. Unfortunate demise of a coronavirus patient in Srinagar this morning,” Rohit Kansal, principal secretary and JK government, tweeted.The person who died in the hospital had no travel history but he had met a couple who had come from Saudi Arabia. The couple is currently admitted in Government Medical College (GMC) in Baramulla. A 65-year-old religious preacher from Srinagar, who had tested positive for the coronavirus disease earlier in the week, had died on Thursday.Most of those who have contracted the coronavirus disease are contacts of the preacher and another infected person who tested positive last week after returning from abroad.“J&K Hardly do I finish my press briefing -28 cases-that I get more unpleasant news -5 new positive cases- 2 in Srinagar, 3 in Jammu- all contacts of previously positive ones ; All Jammu cases asymptomatic. We are at 33 now (sic),” Rohit Kansal had tweeted late on Saturday night.BVR Subrahmanyam, J-K’s chief secretary, appealed people to stay calm and not panic as the number of Covid-19 patients rose to 33.Subrahmanyam said the J-K administration has undertaken an aggressive testing campaign to detect Covid-19 cases as a result of which there is an increase in the number. He said the five new positive cases on Saturday were all contacts of exiting patients and are asymptomatic which would have never been known for up to two weeks and they would have infected hundreds subsequently.The chief secretary said the testing rate in J-K is over 10% of those under surveillance which is higher than states like Kerala. He said medical capacities, response mechanism and other parameters are being quietly ramped up.Subrahmanyam complimented the frontline health workers, field administration and volunteers who are resolutely fighting on the ground to defeat the pandemic.Shahid Choudhary, Srinagar’s deputy commissioner, said a lot more is required to be done for breaking the chain.Former J&K chief minister Omar Abdullah, who was released recently after nearly eight months in detention, also expressed concern over the growing number of Covid-19 cases.“The number of positive #COVIDー19 cases in J&K is going up but it’s not too late to #FlattenTheCurve. All we have to do is follow the guidelines to maintain #SocialDistanacing & #StayAtHomeAndStaySafe. Please disclose your travel history & contacts to the authorities (sic),” Omar tweeted.So far, 5763 travellers and people in contact with suspected cases have been put under surveillance. Meanwhile, all six samples tested in Ladakh were reported to be negative. Not a single positive case has been reported in the last seven days in Ladakh where 13 people had tested positive for coronavirus.Two people have already recovered from the disease, officials have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-67-yr-old-dies-of-covid-19-in-srinagar-says-official/story-kA6BlkGifGOfWctoPupATN.html

29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Bhubaneswar private hospital’s closure leaves dialysis patients in a lurch||The quarantining of a popular private hospital in Odisha’s Bhubaneswar after it treated a man, who later tested positive for coronavirus, has left more than 30 patients undergoing dialysis at its centre in a lurch.A 60-year-old Bhubaneswar man, who tested positive for the coronavirus disease on March 26, had attended the OPD and then admitted to the ICU of Kar Clinic between March 21 and March 23 for treatment of cough and cold leading to pneumonia. After he was diagnosed with Covid-19, Kar Clinic was closed for violation of Odisha government’s guideline and 21 doctors and other caregivers of the hospital were put under quarantine.After the Kar Clinic’s closure, a dialysis centre run in its campus by NephroPlus, a leading dialysis network of the country, at least 35 patients who used to get their dialysis done twice a week in the centre have been left in the lurch.Subash Samal, a 39-year-old renal patient who has been undergoing dialysis for over last 15 months, said he was turned away by other hospitals in the city after they found that he attended Kar Clinic.“The hospitals asked for a negative test report for corona from Capital Hospital, the nodal centre for Covid-19. When I went to the Capital hospital, its director initially turned us away saying too many people were in the queue and we have to wait for three months to get our sample tested,” said Samal.“After I and other patients created an uproar, our swab samples were taken for testing at a laboratory. The test reports would be known tomorrow. Though I should have undergone dialysis today, I have no other way but to wait till Monday. It’s a question of life and death for me,” he said.Similarly, Swapnarani Patnaik, 38 said she too was turned away by other hospitals in the city over fears that she may be infected. “I am getting dialysis for about a year. I had last done on March 24 and the second one was scheduled today. When I went to another hospital they asked me for a negative test report for Covid-19. If water accumulates in my kidney I would die if I don’t get dialysis done latest by tomorrow. I have been waiting at the Capital Hospital since 6am for the test of my samples,” said Patnaik.Laxmi Chhualasingha was also turned away by other hospitals as she lacked a negative test report for Covid-19. Her husband Narayan Chhualasingh said dialysis patients were being punished for no fault of theirs. “We have to undergo dialysis twice a week. If there is a delay of 12 hours we may die. To get my wife’s swab samples tested, I got her to Capital Hospital in the morning, but I was told we have to wait long. She has to undergo dialysis quickly,” he said.Sateesh Mohapatra, who works in Bengaluru, was distressed after his 80-year-old father was turned away by other hospitals for dialysis.“My father was getting his dialysis at Kar Clinic. To get a negative test report for coronavirus, he drove to Capital Hospital today himself and did the screening. He stayed there for almost five hours and returned at about 3pm,” said Mohapatra.“He was told to collect the report tomorrow and then they will direct to some hospital where dialysis can be done. My major concern is how my father will do all these himself,” he said.Ashok Patnaik, the director of Capital Hospital, said samples of not more than 10-12 dialysis patients can be tested at a time as the hospital was already overloaded with the collection of samples of people who came in contact with two Covid-19 patients. “I told the patients that you select 10 most serious patients among yourselves and we would send their samples for testing. Kar Clinic has become our major headache now and we may enter the third phase of Covid-19 transmission due to it,” said Patnaik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-bhubaneswar-private-hospital-s-closure-leaves-dialysis-patients-in-a-lurch/story-SkqClUOzIl4R0BlnZnbIQO.html

29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Odisha suggests release of 1700 inmates to decongest jails||The Odisha government has suggested the release of 1700 undertrials and convicts on parole to decongest the state’s jails and maintain social distancing norms as one of the several measures to stop the spread of Covid-19, the coronavirus disease. Odisha’s prison department officials said a committee was set up in accordance with a recent Supreme Court directive to all states for decongesting jails to prevent the spread of coronavirus.“On Friday, 60 jail inmates were allowed to go on parole and more would be allowed in the coming days. Individual jails in the districts have committees that can decide on the release of inmates on parole as per the guidelines for anything between five to seven days,” Santosh K Upadhyay, director-general of prisons, said.Odisha has 90 jails with a capacity to accommodate 18,012 inmates. Currently, around 15,789 inmates, including 3594 convicts have been lodged in those jails. Early this month, the ministry of home affairs in a letter to all states had advised several steps to reduce movement of prisoners including their production in courts.Upadhyay said early this month that all jail superintendents had been advised to prevent gathering inside and outside prisons and motivate all prisoners to wash their hands three times a day before eating. The jail superintendents were also asked to keep an eye on the prisoners who had sore throat, cough, fever and cold so that they can be lodged separately in isolation wards.“We also moved a lot of prisoners in overcrowded jails to other jails to prevent the possibility of an outbreak of the virus,” he said.Since the outbreak of the coronavirus disease in the country, all visits by NGOs for educational activities have already been suspended for a month and jail cooks have been asked to wear face masks. Visitors have been asked to avail the facility of e-mulakat or visit facility from their homes instead of coming to the jails physically.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-odisha-suggests-release-of-1700-inmates-to-decongest-jails/story-qsaRud1ma1bODokPvNz7pI.html

29-03-2020||India||Rebel MLA who joined BJP disqualified from Manipur Assembly||State assembly speaker Y Khemchand Singh disqualified BJP MLA Thounaojam Shyamkumar Singh from the assembly on Saturday on the grounds of defection under the 10th schedule of the Constitution. Nearly three years ago, in 2017, at least 15 Congress MLAs had petitioned the Speaker seeking Shyamkumar’s disqualification for jumping ship to the BJP after winning on Congress ticket.The Speaker’s decision to disqualify Shyamkumar came after the Supreme Court had, on January 21, expressed its strong disapproval to the delay by the Speaker in deciding the disqualification petitions filed by Congress MLAs. The top court had eventually passed an order on March 18, restraining Shyamkumar from entering the state assembly and also directing that he shall cease to be a minister in the BJP government. Shyamkumar was a minister of town planning, forest and environment. Shyamkumar had resigned from the house on March 26 after the Supreme Court order.“...it is established beyond doubt that the respondent had voluntarily given up the membership of the Indian National Congress… I, therefore, hold that the respondent Shri Thounaojam Shyamkumar, Member of the Manipur Legislative Assembly, 7-Andro Assembly Constituency, Manipur, had incurred disqualification for being a member of the Manipur Legislative Assembly,” the Speaker said on Saturday.In 2017 Manipur assembly elections, the Congress party had emerged as the single-largest party by securing 28 seats in the 60-seat assembly. However, the BJP, with 21 seats, moved in to stake its claim in an alliance with the Naga People’s Front, Nationalist People’s Party and the Lok Janshakti Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rebel-mla-who-joined-bjp-disqualified-from-manipur-assembly/story-CO74O0h6e723aCJnVkfUbN.html

29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: CGHS norms tweaked to cut crowding at wellness centres||The Centre has directed wellness centres under the Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) to take a set of measures, including giving medicines to beneficiaries with chronic diseases for three months at a time, to ensure the clinics are decongested.According to a health ministry order dated March 20, beneficiaries who suffer from ailments such as diabetes, hypertension and heart diseases should get their prescribed medicines for three months at a time. Normally, medicines under CGHS are provided for a month.“But because of Covid-19, we are working on reducing the number of people who come to wellness centres for effective social distancing,” said a staff member from a centre in south Delhi’s Lajpat Nagar.CGHS provides cashless treatment to central government employees – including retired staffers – at their own centres or empanelled hospitals. It also reimburses claims of medical services not provided by its panel of hospitals. There are around 3.5 million beneficiaries across the country.Beneficiaries over 60 year or those with low immunity, uncontrolled blood sugar levels or any such illnesses can send another person to collect medicines on their behalf, the order states. This will ensure that those who are particularly vulnerable don’t have to step out of their homes.The government also allowed people with chronic diseases to buy their medicines from local pharmacies. They will be reimbursed and don’t have to provide a ‘non-availability certificate’ from their wellness centre. Reimbursements are usually given only for medicines that are unavailable in wellness centres.The guidelines state that the beneficiaries need not come to the clinics to submit their reimbursement claims; they can be submitted to respective ministries or departments.Further, they can book consultations online.“Hospitals are preparing for a surge in Covid-19 cases for which routine services are being curtailed. So, the wellness centres and dispensaries are needed to ensure people keep receiving medical consultations and medicines without going to the hospitals,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.The office memorandum from the CGHS director states that leaves of the health care workers from the department – except those on medical leave -- be cancelled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-cghs-norms-tweaked-to-cut-crowding-at-wellness-centres/story-wHcqr6X8l7kvXxFp7VMiEP.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Kerala turns to PM Modi after Karnataka closes its borders||Kerala on Saturday approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi after Karnataka closed its border points even as the state reported its first Covid-19 related death, two months after the virus was detected in the country.After Karnataka blocked all roads leading to Kerala, many areas in the state witnessed scarcity of vegetables, fruits and other essential items.“Karnataka’s actions are against the federal structure of the country. How can you block roads with boulders and sand? We sought the help of the Prime Minister. Despite the Centre’s assurance, the situation remained same,” Pinarayi Vijayan, the chief minister, said.He cited the death of a heart patient in Kasaragod after his vehicle was denied entry to a hospital in the port city Mangaluru in Karnataka.“In such a crisis situation we never expected such an attitude from our neighbour. Union minister Sadananda Gowda intervened first. Later, the state chief secretary also approached the cabinet secretary,” the CM said.Usually, people of north Kerala turn to Mangaluru, a medical hub, for treatment but after the closure of entry points many patients were left stranded at check posts. Besides the death of the heart patient, a pregnant woman gave birth in the ambulance after it was sent back.“The PM talked in length about unity and solidarity at the critical juncture. But we haven’t got a fair deal from our neighbour and we hope it will be corrected at the earliest,” the CM said.Pinarayi Vijayan added it was the responsibility of the Centre to find a solution before it develops into an interstate dispute.After Karnataka witnessed violence over the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) a couple of months ago, many BJP leaders in the state had blamed some fundamentalist outfits from Kerala for inciting it. Two neighbouring states have been keeping an uneasy relation since then.Meanwhile, state health minister KK Shailaja said despite doctors’ best efforts they could not save the life a 69-year-old man, who came back from Dubai in the UAE.“Doctors tried their best to save his life. He had multiple complications. He died this morning at the Ernakulam medical college hospital. It is really sad,” she said. The man, who had bypass surgery five years ago, came to the country on March 16 from Dubai. He was tested positive on March 22, six days after he returned.At least 42 people from his apartment complex and 200 passengers, who travelled in the flight he took from Dubai, are also under observation. His wife and driver were already tested positive for the virus. His body was buried as per the World Health Organization (WHO) protocol and only four of his family members were allowed during the burial. The minister said the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has given its nod for rapid test and it will cut time. Six new cases were reported in Kerala on Saturday, taking the total number to 165 in the state. Two of the new cases are from Thiruvananthapuram district, and one each from Kollam, Palakkad, Malappuram and Kasaragod districts. Two patients from Kottayam and one each from Thiruvananthapuram and Ernakulam districts have fully recovered. This includes one foreign national. At least 134,370 people are under observation in the state which reported the first case in the country in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-kerala-turns-to-pm-modi-after-karnataka-closes-its-borders/story-Ws0ZcSW9wM6pAINh1EEg4K.html

29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Mass movement catches authorities off guard||A gathering of tens of thousands of migrant workers from across the city, walking towards Anand Vihar bus terminal to cross into Uttar Pradesh, took officials on the ground by surprise by Saturday. Till late evening, there was no relent in the sea of people marching towards the border.On the roads, some workers tried to stop some government buses headed towards the Delhi-UP border at Anand Vihar. The bus drivers, however, folded their hands, apologised and drove away. There was no space remaining inside the bus. Unable to board a bus, thousands of women and children continued to walk towards the border.On the road outside the bus terminal, the exodus of migrant workers seemed to have taken the government officials by surprise as any signs of management was limited to police and the civil defence personnel allowing the workers to board the buses in small batches and doctors screening people with thermal scanners. “I walked 10 kilometres to reach Anand Vihar. If I don’t find a bus here, I’ll walk to my home in Kanpur,” said Rahul Ranjan, a plumber, echoing the sentiment of many others.To help people reach the bus terminals and city borders, the Delhi government had pressed 570 buses into service, even as deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia urged migrants to “adhere to the lockdown for their own safety.” The Delhi Police deployed dozens of police personnel at Anand Vihar and increased the deployment of personnel on the ground as the crowds surged, said MS Randhawa, the spokesperson of the city’s police force.“At every check post we tried to persuade people to stay back in Delhi, assuring them of food and medical attention,” he said.Those in queue said social and physical distancing could wait. They continued to push each other on a two-kilometre-long queue to be among the lucky ones to find and board a bus. “Our worry is not the coronavirus. We are more worried about getting stranded in Delhi. We will think about the virus after reaching home,” Manu Yadav, 21, said.The Delhi government said that they were unable to provide buses to drop the workers home because their buses run on CNG. “All our buses are CNG-based and we could not provide the Delhi Transport Corporation buses or cluster buses to drop migrants to cities in Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Rajasthan,and Haryana, among other states, because of lack of CNG stations these. The buses would run out of fuel,” said a senior official in Delhi transport department.Another official said, “Friday night, a huge number of workers started moving towards the Kaushambi bus terminal (near Anand Vihar) after learning that around 1,000 buses are being deployed by the Uttar Pradesh government there. On getting this information, the Delhi government started sending its DTC buses to pick people up from the road and ferrying them to the Kaushambi bus terminal. The terminal, like the Anand Vihar terminal, was completely shut from all sides and people started gathering in large numbers on the main road.”On Friday, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, wrote to all chief secretaries of states about migrant workers leaving for their homes and asked them to stop the exodus by providing them facilities. “Saturday morning, while Uttar Pradesh provided its buses, the Delhi government started offering bus service to migrant workers from its Ghazipur depot to Hapur in Uttar Pradesh. Those who wanted to be dropped at the UP border for taking the state-operated buses were allowed to deboard,” said a senior official in the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-mass-movement-catches-authorities-off-guard/story-E7zbZ5kZ2kmzsuSJe6DPDO.html

It’s extremely tragic and unfortunate. Request (Afghanistan) President @Ashraf Ghani Ji to find out the perpetrators and look after our people,” Singh had tweeted.Meanwhile, amid media reports that Sikhs in Afghanistan are receiving threats from the Islamic State (IS) following the attack, the SGPC on Saturday offered to rehabilitate Afghan Sikhs if they migrate to India.As per media reports, the IS took the responsibility for the terror attack in Kabul and asked the Sikhs to leave Afghanistan within ten days or get ready to be killed.SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said, “Looking at the threat received by Afghan Sikhs, the government of India should make efforts to help them. The Centre should approach the Afghanistan government to ensure their security and bring them to India, where the SGPC will bear the responsibility of their overall settlement”.He also announced aid of ₹1 lakh each to families of those killed and ₹50,000 each to those injured in the attack. “The Sikhs in Afghanistan are in grave crisis as they are being targeted repeatedly. The Indian government should take up this matter on the international front,” he added.“In case the Afghan Sikhs come to India, the SGPC will rehabilitate them here and take up the responsibility of the education and employment of their children, apart from other kinds of help,” he said.

29-03-2020||India||10 state-run banks to merge on April 1, says RBI||The schemes for the merger of ten state-run banks into four lenders are coming into force from April 1, according to the Reserve Bank of India.The banking regulator in separate releases announced that the branches of merging banks will operate as of the banks in which these have been amalgamated. The government on March 4 had notified the amalgamation schemes for 10 state owned banks into four as part of its consolidation plan to create bigger size stronger banks in the public sector. Bank officers’ unions, however, earlier this week wrote to the prime minister seeking to defer the merger schemes of lenders due to the lockdown triggered by coronavirus outbreak.Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Thursday had clarified that the mega bank consolidation plan was very much on track and would take effect from April 1 despite the onslaught of coronavirus pandemic throwing the country out of gear. As per the scheme, Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India will be merged into Punjab National Bank; Syndicate Bank into Canara Bank; Allahabad Bank into Indian Bank; and Andhra and Corporation banks into Union Bank of India. Under this, the branches of Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India will operate as branches of Punjab National Bank from April 1, 2020, and branches of Syndicate Bank as that of Canara Bank, the RBI said in a separate releases. Allahabad Bank branches will operate as those of Indian Bank while the branches of Andhra Bank and Corporation Bank will function as the branches of Union Bank of India from the beginning of next fiscal year 2020-21, the RBI said.“The Amalgamation of Oriental Bank of Commerce and United Bank of India into Punjab National Bank Scheme, 2020 dated March 4, 2020, issued by the Government of India... The scheme comes into force on the 1st day of April 2020,” RBI said.Customers, including depositors of merging banks will be treated as customers of the banks in which these banks have been merged with effect from April 1, 2020, the RBO noted.Banking services across the country are impacted due to the effect of COVID-19 as a near shut down is being observed across the country.In a letter written to the Prime Minister on March 25, the All India Bank Officers’‘ Confederation (AIBOC) said, “The finance minister yesterday announced a slew of measures in view of the deleterious effect of the contagion. We are also expecting an extension of closing related activities and the revision of the closing date itself from March 31 to June 30, which is the need of the hour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-state-run-banks-to-merge-on-april-1-says-rbi/story-4RIaqkEFsvxkLbODnXaX0M.html

29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: 57-year-old Bengal man’s source of Covid-19 infection unknown||Authorities are yet to trace the source of a 57-year-old railway employee’s infection almost a week after he became the first person to die of Covid-19 in West Bengal with officials maintaining that his case cannot be attributed to community transmission as he took a train from Chhattisgarh on March 2 and may have been infected in that state or the train.“This case cannot be tagged as a community transmission. Even though the victim did not travel to any foreign country and did not have a traceable contact with anyone who has returned from abroad, he had a travel history. He had been to Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh and had returned to Kolkata on March 2. He boarded the Azad Hind Express, which originated from Pune in Maharashtra,” said West Bengal health services director Ajay Chakraborty.“We still do not know the source of his infection...” he said.Maharasthra has the second highest number of Covid-19 cases in India, but the first was detected only on March 9, a week after the rail employee took the train that originated there.His family has doubts over whether he indeed died of Covid-19. “My husband was perfectly okay until he fell ill and had to be admitted to a hospital...I would have surely contracted the disease. So would have his 80-year-old mother who stays with us. I do not believe the hospital reports,” the 57-year-old’s widow said. She is living in isolation.At least 300 people, including his colleagues and 13 families in Chattisgarh, have been asked to stay in home quarantine. Some of his relatives have been kept in isolation wards in Kolkata.As many as 15 positive Covid-19 cases have been detected in West Bengal; 13 of them had either travelled abroad or had come in contact with people who returned from foreign countries. Two persons, including the railway employee, have not had traceable contact with anyone who may have come from abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-57-year-old-railway-employee-s-source-of-covid-19-infection-unknown/story-gxfnP2TmWpN1CJsesO166M.html
29-03-2020||India||Covid-19: How it will change companies||March 28. Day 4 of India’s 21-day lockdown. There are now around 645,000 Covid-19 cases in the world. Of these, the US alone accounts for a little over 116,000. There have also been almost 30,000 deaths, with Italy accounting for around 10,000. Spain accounts for around 5,800. Two countries in Europe, then, account for over 50% of all Covid-19 deaths. And the US, Italy, and Spain account for around 43% of all cases.The number of cases in India crossed 1,000 on Saturday night. This shouldn’t be cause for alarm. It was bound to cross 1,000 some point in time. And, as this writer has repeatedly said, it is very likely that community transmission in India started sometime back. It is also almost certain that the enforced lockdown will flatten the curve – one reason why it is important that everyone adheres to it. At 10.30pm on Saturday night, India had 1,013 cases with nearly 44% of them concentrated in Maharashtra, Kerala, and Karnataka.It’s important to believe that India, and most other countries, will beat the disease – simply because we will (that’s what humans have done through the centuries – beaten the odds). But it’s also important to realise that nothing will be the same again. Not countries (as this column pointed out last Sunday). And not companies. There are five ways in which companies will change.Also Watch |  Migrants’ exodus: Government’s damage controlOne, all companies will now work on proper contingency plans that can last weeks, perhaps even months. Sure, most companies already have them – but these largely remained on paper till they were forcibly put to the test after lockdowns necessitated by the spread of Covid-19 came into effect, at which point they were found wanting.Two, many companies will automate more (the pandemic will accelerate the adoption of automation technologies across industries). They will also shrink their workforce, in one part because of the post-outbreak economic scenario (bleak), and, in another part because it’s only when people WFH that it becomes clear how much W they actually do (and whether this is critical to the organisation or not). As a corollary, companies will move more aggressively to WFH, and also away from open offices. They will start doing more things, including conferences (perhaps even team-building off-sites online – sorry, that was this writer thinking wistfully). No one is going to be wanting to breathe other people’s exhalations for a long time after this.Both of these will benefit Big Tech. The future will bring online communication and collaboration tools of a kind we have never visualised before.Three, companies will review, revise, and sometimes scrap policies, processes, and procedures based on management and manufacturing concepts popularised since the 1970s, and which were pretty much taken for granted. One such, for manufacturing companies, is Kanban, or just-in-time management of inventory. Expect companies to start stocking bigger inventories of parts and raw materials. Expect to see a wave of clustering (getting suppliers to move closer to the factory) and backward integration (where manufacturers start making inputs they need too). Companies are also going to be keen to have their supply-lines in the same country (if not the same county), dealing another blow to globalisation.Four, and this is related to both one and three, continuity will be the most important thing for companies; not cost, perhaps not even efficiency.Five, the health care and pharmaceutical sectors will see a boom, a long one, with countries pumping billions of dollars into them. As a corollary, the business of catering to survivalists, a niche till Covid-19 struck, will become large and mainstream. And a host of new businesses will emerge. In the post-Covid-19 world, everyone is a survivalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-how-it-will-change-companies/story-0DDdiuLAGw78dLRmilphgM.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Centre to import 1 million masks; local firms will make PPE kits||The Centre announced on Saturday it will procure a million masks from other countries as it moved to urgently plug the shortfall in equipment for medical professionals fighting to stop the spread of Covid-19.The government has also been in talks with Indian companies for manufacturing more Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) such as coveralls, goggles, gloves and masks, used by medical staff to protect themselves while performing Covid-19 tests or treating patients.“There is a shortage already, which will escalate if the numbers rise substantially. The ministry of external affairs will reach out to all countries and all manufacturers to try and procure 10 lakh PPE kits. Most of our PPE kits are imported and hospitals had routine supply but nobody in the world had anticipated such an outbreak,” said a senior official from the health ministry on condition of anonymity.India needs around 38 million masks and 6.2 million pieces of PPE to take care of Covid-19 patients, a Reuters report said quoting an internal report from Invest India. Invest India said it contacted 730 companies for ventilators, ICU monitors, protective equipment, of which 319 firms had responded so far.The order for new masks came on a day the number of Covid-19 cases shot past 1,000 even as many doctors complained that a shortage of PPE was hampering their efforts. “Earlier we needed very few of these kits to do H1N1 testing, now that the requirement for PPE has gone up and the availability is low. I am not able to procure PPE needed to do the tests,” said Dr Navin Dang, founder chairman of Dr Dang’s Labs.Resident doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi have written to the administration about a shortage. “We have pointed out to the administration several times that there is a shortage of PPE in the hospital. We keep getting reassurances... But, the fact is that there is a shortage in the market,” said Dr Srinivas Rajkumar T, general secretary of the resident doctors’ association of AIIMS.“At present, the doctors are wearing the HIV kits, which are not adequate as it does not cover the whole body. They use an N-95 mask, a scarf to cover the head and a towel to cover the neck along with the HIV kits. When the swab samples are collected from the back of the throat, people gag and cough, this is ejected onto the person taking the sample. Hence, adequate protection is needed.”“Several companies are responding to our calls for PPE procurement, however, the ministry guidelines clearly state that the material should be such that blood and other secretions do not enter. But the ones that we have tested with water so far are not equipped to protect against moisture,” said Dr JC Passey, director of Lok Nayak hospital in Delhi, which is handling six positive Covid-19 cases.The government is also in talks with Indian manufacturers for making quality kits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-centre-to-import-1-million-masks-local-firms-will-make-ppe-kits/story-CIQWt5Qyv04QNsvs7icyJL.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update- ‘Is that sister Chhaya’: PM Modi dials nurse, continues to work from home||“Is that Sister Chhaya speaking?” “Yes.”“I’m calling from the Prime Minister’s residence, and the PM would like to speak to you.”Then Prime Minister Narendra Modi comes on the line.“Namaste, Sister Chhaya.”For the past week, Modi has been making calls such as this one to individuals across the country. Some, like Sister Chhaya, a nurse at the Naidu Hospital in Pune, whom the PM spoke to on Saturday, are at the front-line of the fight against Covid-19. These calls are aimed at boosting their morale. “Tell me, how are you handling your family? They must be worried about you,” the PM asks Sister Chhaya (as in the UK, female nurses are called sisters in India).“I know sir, but we have to do our work. We manage somehow.”“People must be scared,” he adds. “Darne ka nahin, yeh hamara message hai (don’t be afraid; that’s the message).” Watch | PM Modi interacts with journalists amid coronavirus threat A senior government official familiar with the matter said this is one of the 150-200 phone calls that Modi has been making every day since he announced the nationwide 21-day lockdown last week. After telling everyone to resist from stepping out unless they worked in essential services, the Prime Minister (whose work can actually be described as most essential) has also not stepped outside the 12-acre complex at 7, Lok Kalyan Marg. The number 7 is actually a misnomer, because the complex houses five bungalows (numbers 1, 3, 5 and 9 being the others) on that road. The entire complex, which serves as the residence-cum-camp-office of the Prime Minister, was previously known as 7, Race Course Road, and houses all the different offices that the PM needs. One of them, the Panchwati Bungalow, was the one the PM and his council of ministers were photographed in recently — practising social distancing during a meeting.“That’s the bungalow that’s used for Cabinet meetings,” said a second official. “The Prime Minister has always used the LKM office more for his work, dropping into South Block (where the Prime Minister’s Office, or PMO, is located) just once or twice a week.” However, since the lockdown, Modi has been totally working from home.“It is an extraordinary situation,” said the chief spokesperson of the government, KS Dhatwalia. “I think it may be for the first time that the Prime Minister will be based in Delhi for 21 days [at a stretch]. I don’t think it has ever happened in six years [since he assumed office].”Also read | Covid-19: How it will change companiesModi has followed a gruelling schedule, travelling around the country for important engagements and also for outreach. Announcing a complete lockdown was a tough call, which has been welcomed as much as it has been critiqued. However, the government sees it as a bitter medicine for the “war against corona”, one of the aides said. And so this has meant that the PM’s principal secretary, PK Mishra, who has also been working from home, comes to see the Prime Minister every day as does the government’s senior most bureaucrat, cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba. These two daily visitors aside, his schedule also includes a briefing by the Group of Ministers overseeing India’s Covid-19 response, headed by health minister Harsh Vardhan. He also talks with leaders from across the country and the world. “I don’t think the PM is working less,’’ said the first official. “He continues to wake up at 4am and do his series of calls and video meetings. Work goes on.”However, it isn’t really usual. The work from home applies not just to all PMO staffers but also to members of the Special Protection Group that protects him. “If before, three staffers would go to a meeting at the PMO, now only one person goes,” said the second official.On Saturday, Modi made calls to some chief ministers, and participated in a video conference with people who practise alternative systems of medicine such as Ayurveda. “If you look at the decisions that the PM has taken and following it up, this is a complete hands-on approach,” said A Surya Prakash, former Prasar Bharti chairman. And the messaging from the country’s top office is simple: in order to stay safe, stay home.Also read | Coronavirus update: Delhi eating joint employee walks 200 km to reach home, dies on the road||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-is-that-sister-chhaya-pm-modi-dials-nurse-continues-to-work-from-home/story-OsDE5c4dOqkT3OrW0OYMNK.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Covid-19 cases in India cross 1,000 mark; thousands on streets||India on Saturday recorded 135 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), one of the highest single-day spikes, as the number of cases crossed 1,000 amid a mounting challenge of controlling the spread of the disease that has killed about 30,000 people across the world.Fresh deaths were reported in India from Kerala, Gujarat and Maharashtra, taking the death toll from the disease to 21, according to official data from states. Maharashtra has reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases so far at 186, with 29 fresh cases on Saturday, followed by Kerala at 182. In Telangana, the number went up to 67, while Karnataka has reported 76 cases so far.The official data of the Union health ministry, however, said the case count was 918, which showed there was a lag in the official numbers released by states being taken into account.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who on Tuesday declared a 21-day national lockdown to contain the spread of the disease, announced the creation of a Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund where people can contribute and help in the fight against Covid-19.“It is my appeal to my fellow Indians, kindly contribute to the PM-CARES Fund. This Fund will also cater to similar distressing situations, if they occur in the times ahead,” he said. “This will go a long way in creating a healthier India,” Modi added.A statement posted on his official website said that while the Prime Minister is the chairman of the new public charitable trust, its members include the defence minister (Rajnath Singh), home minister (Amit Shah) and the finance minister (Nirmala Sitharaman).As per officials in Kerala, which has the second highest number of cases after Maharashtra, the state reported its first Covid-19 death on Saturday after a 69-year-old man died at Ernakulam Medical College Hospital, but it was not included in the central data.The man was admitted to the isolation ward on March 22 after his return from Dubai, the government hospital said. Maharashtra has reported 286 cases.In Delhi, among the eight people who tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday was a 48-year-old doctor at a private clinic in Hari Nagar. The Delhi health department wasn’t immediately able to trace the source of the infection. “From the history given to us by him, he had gone for a home visit to a person who had returned from New Zealand. However, no such person has tested positive in Delhi yet,” said a senior official from the Delhi health department. The total number of cases in Delhi went up to 49. The Union health ministry’s joint secretary, Lav Agarwal, said the government was working with states on health infrastructure preparedness and the focus was having dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and blocks in every state. Arrangements were being made to ramp up isolation and intensive care beds. Seventeen states have so far started work on this, he said, adding that doctors and nurses were being provided online training from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. The developments came on a day the government faced a fresh challenge – the exodus of many of India’s 100 million migrant workers from the national capital after a nationwide lockdown left them stranded without jobs, food and shelter. India’s response to Covid-19 has been “pre-emptive, pro-active and graded”, the government said, brushing aside the allegation that the nationwide lockdown was announced without any planning. The information and broadcasting ministry said the government had already put in place a “comprehensive response system” at the borders of the country, much before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30.The ministry of home affairs issued another advisory urging all states and Union territories (UTs) to take immediate relief measures to provide temporary accommodation, food, clothing and medical care to homeless people, including migrant workers stranded due to the lockdown.Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said aircraft were crisscrossing the Indian airspace to ensure that the Covid-19 testing kits of ICMR reached their destinations on time. The Indian Navy, too, deployed its aircraft to help the Goa government transport 60 samples to the Pune-based National Institute of Virology for testing, an official said on Saturday. The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said there were “sporadic cases” where the origin of the infections could not be traced but denied there was an alarming spread in the country. “Till the time we see a significant number of cases to indicate community transmission, let us not over-interpret things,” said Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at ICMR.(With inputs from agencies )||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-update-covid-19-cases-in-india-cross-1-000-mark-thousands-on-streets/story-8J2AJxO636SVgsnZCQeBlO.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Clear blue skies in Delhi, AQI at 45 bring some good news||Delhi woke up to clear blue skies yet again on Saturday, Day 4 of the 21-day lockout announced by the government to halt the spread of Covid-19. Clear blue skies have become the norm rather than the exception in the National Capital Region (NCR) around Delhi for the past week. Data, too, shows a sharp decline in pollution.Morning and evening peaks in the level of PM 2.5 (particulate matter 2.5, or fine, respirable pollution particles) have flattened out in the four days since the lockdown came into force, according to a new analysis by the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). The air quality index for the Capital, according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s 4pm bulletin was 45, which falls in the “good” zone -- rare in a city where a reading in the “poor ” category is otherwise considered good.The reduction in nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations is even more pronounced because the major source of NO2 emissions are vehicles , which have gone off the roads, and industries, which have been ordered to close to reduce the risk of infection.The hourly pollution trend in Delhi and in the neighbouring cities of Gurugram, Faridabad, Noida and Ghaziabad analysed by CSE used to be influenced by traffic peaks in the mornings and evenings, a factor hasn’t been relevant in the past four days.For example, in Delhi the daily peak PM 2.5 concentrations has declined on a lockdown day by about 57% compared to a regular day and the peak on the “Janta Curfew” day (Sunday, March 22) dropped by about 24% compared to a regular day. The peak concentrations of NO2 dropped by 66% on a lockdown day compared to a regular day and by 32% on the people’s curfew day.The so-called Janta Curfew was called for by Prime Minister Narendra Modi as a sort of a trial in social distancing and self-isolation. The lockdown was announced two days later. “This analysis brings out the pronounced effect of traffic on hourly pollution trend and on daily exposures to toxic vehicular pollution. With traffic minimised, hourly trends plummet. This is sharply evident in NO2 trends,” CSE said in its analysis. The fact that the impact was comparatively lower on Janta Curfew may have had to do with its shorter duration of 14 hours, the study said. “Subsequent lockdown is more rigorous and pertains to 24 hours with curfew rules in place,” it said. There’s also the cumulative effect to be taken into account. The main source of NO2 emissions is fuel combustion by vehicles and industries. NO2 is more reactive than PM 2.5, and being exposed to high NO2 emissions even for a short duration can aggravate respiratory disease particularly asthma, according to the US Environment Protection Agency.Globally, four million new child asthma cases are attributable to NO2 pollution a year; 64% of these occur in urban centres, according to a study published in Lancet Planetary Health.“This experience has helped us to understand the strong impact of traffic volume on hourly variability in pollution and exposure in cities. We are already making massive lifestyle adjustments to practice social distancing,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment. “Can this crisis-induced change throw up long-term solutions to traffic impact on air pollution? Collective community action during this pandemic can help us to reinvent longer term solutions to reduce our vulnerability to toxic risk.”“Since every source of emissions is curtailed, air pollution levels have reduced drastically in Delhi-NCR. We are in agreement with CSE but we are also doing an analysis in-house,” said VK Shukla, head of the air quality management division at CPCB.The Regional Weather Forecasting Centre (RCFW) in Delhi, meanwhile, released historical data for the maximum temperature recorded in April, which ranges from 39.6 degree Celsius in 1994 to 43.7 degrees Celsius in 2010. The impact of heat and humidity on the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 is not clear. “Data analysis since 1992 shows maximum temperature over Delhi reaches 40 degree C during April 17 to 20. If temperature and humidity play a role in reduction of transmission of the virus , we will be able to see the trends in April. But things will be different if people use air conditioning indoors,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, RWFC.The average maximum temperature in March in Delhi is 29.6 degree C compared to 28 degree C recorded till now. But on most days in March this year, the maximum temperature has been 3 to 4 degree C below normal with only seven days when the maximum was 30 degree C or above. This is because of the unusually high number of western disturbances which affected the northwestern region this month. There have been six active western disturbances which brought rain, hail or snowfall to different parts of northwest India compared to an average of 2-3 typical for March.“The westerlies are still impacting the Indian region. They are supposed to move northwards gradually in March. This is why we are seeing more western disturbances. Parts of Central India and south India are already recording 35 degree C. We can expect it to hit 35 degree C in north India in early April,” said DS Pai, a scientist at the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Pune.Clear skies and less noise means that bird song can be heard clearly in many neighbourhoods of the capital. “’I have had a lot of people asking me if bird song has increased. No, it has always been there particularly in this season. This is also the courting and nesting season for many birds -- sunbirds, barbets and doves. So they sing or call for long periods. People now have the time to pause, listen and take in the song. The lack of planes and cars also helps as planes and car horns are sources of noise pollution,” said Neha Sinha, a Delhi-based conservation biologist.For PM 2.5 and NO2 concentration analysis following days have been considered by CSE:• Regular: Average of March 18 and 19• Lockdown: Average of March 25 and 26• Janata Curfew: Average of March 22 March||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clear-blue-skies-aqi-at-45-bring-some-good-news/story-iy1wcJ8yyVle997TVxIYVM.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Community spread of Covid-19 in India? Experts, government differ||Ten people hospitalised with acute pneumonia in India have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Some scientists would consider that community transmission -- the all-important phase 3 of an infectious disease such as Covid-19, where infected people have no history of travel to a Covid-positive country, or direct or indirect contact with an infected person or a carrier. What it means for countryTen pneumonia patients, with no history of foreign travel or contact with a Covid-19 confirmed case, have tested positive This raises concerns that community transmission (phase-3) has begun, which would make it difficult to stop the spread of Covid-19Officials, however, say there is no concrete evidence to prove phase-3 has started, which — according to experts — could also point to the lack of mass testingICMR’s head of epidemiology and communicable diseases Dr Raman Gangakhedkar admits that there are a few “sporadic instances” such as this, but that “the numbers are not significant enough to establish that there is community transmission because people sometimes don’t recall or don’t give the correct history fearing stigma”. “Till these numbers are not significantly high, we should not over-interpret it,” he added. The number of positive cases in India were past 1,000 (1,013) as of 10.30pm Saturday night. On Friday, they rose by over 100 for the first time. Experts say India’s numbers will continue to remain low because the country’s testing protocol is still very stringent. It is restricted to symptomatic and asymptomatic people with a history of travel to countries hit by the Covid outbreak and contact with infected people, and to health workers caring for Covid-19 patients. While testing has now been expanded to 47 private laboratories (in addition to 113 government ones), the protocol remains the same. “I don’t know what is stopping the government from doing extensive testing. It’s difficult to speculate on community transmission without data, I think we will know of community transmission only after it has crossed a certain threshold,” said Dr Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru.The Covid-19 cases with no travel history or contact with a positive case were picked up under the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s expanded Covid-19 sentinel surveillance network, under which all patients admitted with severe acute respiratory infection (SARI) admitted in public and private hospitals are tested for the disease, which starts with symptoms of cough and fever, and causes death from acute pneumonia in around 2% of those infected.But there are gaps even in this, an expert said. “There has been no solid evidence of community transmission of Covid-19 as yet, but we need to continue monitoring confirmed cases and establish detailed contact tracing to know if we are entering the phase of community transmission. Several states are not implementing the SARI surveillance properly. If all the states implement the SARI surveillance properly, we will know reliability,” said Bengaluru-based Dr Giridhar R Babu, professor and head, lifecourse epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.The expanded testing protocol was announced on March 21 to include all those who are hospitalised with SARI in public and private hospitals to identify Covid-positive cases with no history of travel or contact with a known Covid-19 case, which indicates community transmission. Once community transmission starts, and undiagnosed and often asymptomatic people start seeding outbreaks, it becomes difficult to break the chain of transmission and stop infection.“Even if one case of unknown etiology is community transmission, and if we can’t trace the source, we are in trouble,” a public health expert said on condition of anonymity. “At this moment, we have to assume all of us are infected. However, announcing a lockdown means that the government suspected or expected community transmission,” said Dr T Jacob John, retired professor and head of the department of clinical virology at the Christian Medical College, Vellore.Limiting surveillance to testing SARI patients and people with a travel history or contact with diagnosed cases may exclude unidentified contacts who can potentially seed community transmission, experts said. And widening the testing net will provide more robust data. The Gujarat model of community surveillance can help identify clusters before they get admitted to hospitals. “The state is tracking data from all 108 EMRI (emergency management and research institute) ambulances, which provide 70% of all medical emergency services in Gujarat and electronically record symptoms of cough, fever and pulse oxygen levels online. A sudden spurt in cases in a location would indicate an outbreak that needs investigation,” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health-Gandhinagar.“The government should have had a system of testing anybody with symptoms at their homes during this lockdown period. If it is cough, fever and breathlessness, it should be treated as Covid-19 unless proved otherwise, so samples should be collected and the person hospitalised and the person’s family should be quarantined. A clinician can understand these symptoms. We could have found a 1,000 or more cases, if it was well tracked,” said Dr John.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-spread-in-india-experts-government-differ/story-iM2kddVQftMzYz1f105b2N.html
29-03-2020||India||Covid-19 update: Bus facility draws sea of humanity in time of coronavirus||Jobless, without money to pay rent or for food, thousands of migrant workers flooded the interstate Anand Vihar bus terminal on Saturday to board buses back home from across the border in Kaushambi, Uttar Pradesh — posing just the kind of risk India was trying to avoid with a 21-day lockdown to prevent the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Government and police officers on the ground estimated the gathering to be more than 100,000.Prime Minister Narendra Modi called up Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday to discuss measures to clear the UP-Delhi border. The chief minister is learnt to have said the Delhi government had left no stone unturned in convincing people to stay back and adhere to the lockdown. “Shelters have been provided and adequate food has been arranged. However, a large number of people refused, especially after the Uttar Pradesh government started providing buses. In Delhi, the deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia himself went to the city border to convince groups and partially succeeded. All MLAs were asked to step up relief operations for the poor. The CM informed the PM about all these steps,” said a senior officer in the chief minister’s office.After the PM raised concern over the issue, the states of Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Bihar and Delhi stepped up their coordination and arrangements to ferry migrant workers to their hometowns.“To decongest the Anand Vihar-Ghaziabad border, the UP, Haryana and Bihar governments are now planning to deploy around 2,000 buses tonight. The aim is to clear most of the people waiting at Anand Vihar overnight,” a senior official in the Delhi government said. Carrying merely a few sets of clothes in their bags, and with leftover cash, covering their mouths with handkerchiefs, migrant workers from across the city walked on the roads of east Delhi with their families and associates to join the 2km long queue at the Delhi-UP border to board buses back home. Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath said in a statement that he has issued orders to district magistrates to ensure that the around 100,000 people who have crossed into the state be home quarantined. The workers who stood in the queue on the road to cross the border had something in common: they had all lost their jobs. Until last week, they lived in the factories or shops where they worked but all had been shut in the wake of the nationwide lockdown announced by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday evening as one of the measures to control the spread of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Their employers had asked them to return home. The Delhi government pressed 570 buses into service to ferry such migrant workers from across the city to the borders but most officers on the ground said it wasn’t enough. Right across the road at the Kaushambi bus terminus, the Uttar Pradesh government provided 500 buses to drop them to their villages in UP. During the day, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to the people to “stay back”, assuring them of shelter and regular meals, even as he said that such an exodus potentially increases the risk of spread. “The lockdown imposed by the Prime Minister was a necessary step to stop the spread of coronavirus. We must understand that if we violate the lockdown, we may end up risking ourselves like many other countries across the world where the virus has claimed thousands of lives. I can understand how people are anxious and why they insist on heading back home. They fear that it [the lockdown] may last longer. But it is my appeal to them to stay back for their own safety. Such an exodus increases the risk of spread,” said Kejriwal.But the numbers continued to swell till late on Saturday night. From different parts of the city, workers continued to walk to the border. The Delhi government’s buses were full. Radha Yadav,43, who worked at a factory in Nangloi, was among the many walking towards the border. He said he had heard the government’s appeal but would continue to walk. “I don’t have a job or a home here. If I have to die, I will die in my village.” Bihar chief minister, Nitish Kumar, expressed his reservations about the UP government’s decision to run special buses to ferry migrants from Ghaziabad-Noida. “It’s a wrong step. This is will help further in the spread of the virus, which will be difficult to contain. This will defeat the entire purpose of the lockdown. Arrangements should be made at that very place where the person is staying,” he said on Saturday.He suggested that camps should be made at the local level with provisions for accommodation and food.The Union home ministry on Saturday issued an order asking all states to use the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) to provide temporary accommodation, food, clothing and medical care to the migrants in relief camps and other places. The funding directive comes a day after the ministry asked the states to make arrangements for the food and basic amenities for such people.Two airlines, SpiceJet and GoAir, offered the government their fleets to transport those migrating across states. As of Saturday, no government agency appeared to have responded to the offer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bus-facility-draws-sea-of-humanity-in-time-of-virus/story-ywWxT5iEx6bSIPmYlHClII.html
29-03-2020||India||1,000 cases; thousands on streets||New Delhi: India on Saturday recorded 135 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), one of the highest single-day spikes, as the number of cases crossed 1,000 amid a mounting challenge of controlling the spread of the disease that has killed over 28,000 people across the world.Fresh deaths were reported in India from Kerala, Gujarat and Maharashtra, taking the death toll from the disease to 21, according to official data from states. Maharashtra has reported the highest number of Covid-19 cases so far at 186, with 29 fresh cases on Saturday, followed by Kerala at 182. In Telangana, the number went up to 67, while Karnataka has reported 76 cases so far.The official data of the Union health ministry, however, said the case count was 918, which showed there was a lag in the official numbers released by states being taken into account.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who on Tuesday declared a 21-day national lockdown to contain the spread of the disease, announced the creation of a Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund where people can contribute and help in the fight against Covid-19.“It is my appeal to my fellow Indians, kindly contribute to the PM-CARES Fund. This Fund will also cater to similar distressing situations, if they occur in the times ahead,” he said. “This will go a long way in creating a healthier India,” Modi added.A statement posted on his official website said that while the Prime Minister is the chairman of the new public charitable trust, its members include the defence minister (Rajnath Singh), home minister (Amit Shah) and the finance minister (Nirmala Sitaraman).As per officials in Kerala, which has the second highest number of cases after Maharashtra, the state reported its first Covid-19 death on Saturday after a 69-year-old man being died at Ernakulam Medical College Hospital, but it was not included in the central data.The man was admitted to the isolation ward on March 22 after his return from Dubai, the government hospital said. Maharashtra has reported 286 cases.In Delhi, among the eight people who tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday was a 48-year-old doctor at a private clinic in Hari Nagar. The Delhi health department wasn’t immediately able to trace the source of the infection. “From the history given to us by him, he had gone for a home visit to a person who had returned from New Zealand. However, no such person has tested positive in Delhi yet,” said a senior official from the Delhi health department. The total number of cases in Delhi went up to 49. The Union health ministry’s joint secretary, Lav Agarwal, said the government was working with states on health infrastructure preparedness and the focus was having dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and blocks in every state. Arrangements were being made to ramp up isolation and intensive care beds. Seventeen states have so far started work on this, he said, adding that doctors and nurses were being provided online training from the All India Institute of Medical Scienes. The developments came on a day the government faced a fresh challenge – the exodus of many of India’s 100 million migrant workers from the national capital after a nationwide lockdown left them stranded without jobs, food and shelter.India’s response to Covid-19 has been “pre-emptive, pro-active and graded”, the government said, brushing aside the allegation that the nationwide lockdown was announced without any planning.The information and broadcasting ministry said the government had already put in place a “comprehensive response system” at the borders of the country, much before the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a public health emergency of international concern on January 30.The ministry of home affairs issued another advisory urging all states and Union territories (UTs) to take immediate relief measures to provide temporary accommodation, food, clothing and medical care to homeless people, including migrant workers stranded due to the lockdown.Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said aircraft were crisscrossing the Indian airspace to ensure that the Covid-19 testing kits of ICMR reached their destinations on time. The Indian Navy, too, deployed its aircraft to help the Goa government transport 60 samples to the Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) for testing, an official said on Saturday.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said there were “sporadic cases” where the origin of the infections could not be traced but denied that there was an alarming spread of SARS-CoV-2 in the country.“Till the time we see a significant number of cases to indicate community transmission, let us not over-interpret things,” said Raman R Gangakhedkar, head of the Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at ICMR.(With inputs from agencies )||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-000-cases-thousands-on-streets/story-olBkPYFMxYwzm0zvLGm8gM.html

It’s shameful that we’ve allowed any Indian citizen to be treated this way and that the Government had no contingency plans in place for this exodus,” he tweeted.Rahul Gandhi hit out at the Centre over the “appalling condition” of migrant workers walking back to their homes. “The government is responsible for this terrible condition. Bringing citizens to such a state is a very big crime,” he tweeted. He said all citizens should at least get support and respect, and urged the government to take concrete steps so that the current situation does not turn into a tragedy.Rahul Gandhi urged the people and his party leaders and workers to come forward to provide food, water and shelter to the migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-chief-forms-task-force-for-management/story-UdSgBIbU7Xq6QzY4LWt8HO.html

29-03-2020||India||PM-CARES Fund set up to meet coronavirus expenses||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday urged people to contribute to a public charitable trust-- the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund --to meet the expenses incurred on fighting the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and meet the cost of healthcare and other services.The fund has been set up exclusively to the meet challenges brought on by the virus, a government functionary said. “There is a PM’s Relief Fund that already exists, but the donations made there are used for many purposes. It was felt that there should be a separate account to keep track of donations made for the present emergency; it will provide clarity in accounting for how much was collected and spent for the corona pandemic,” said the functionary, who requested anonymity.The PM also tweeted that the funds has been set up after people from all walks of life expressed their desire to donate to India’s war against Covid-19.“Respecting that spirit, the Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund has been constituted. This will go a long way in creating a healthier India. It is my appeal to my fellow Indians, Kindly contribute to the PM-CARES Fund. This Fund will also cater to similar distressing situations, if they occur in the times ahead,” he wrote.The PM-CARES Fund will accept micro-donations too, the PM said, and added, “It will strengthen disaster management capacities and encourage research on protecting citizens. Let us leave no stone unturned to make India healthier and more prosperous for our future generations.”The fund, which has the PM as the chairperson and the defence minister, home minister and finance minister as members, began to receive donations soon after the link was shared by the PM. The Indian Administrative Service association donated Rs 21 lakh and actor Akshay Kumar pledged Rs 25 crore.To increase the ambit for collection and spending of money, the home ministry also allowed states to spend from the state disaster relief funds on shelter and food for those in need.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president J.P. Nadda also announced that all party MPs will release Rs 1 crore from their annual development fund for central relief efforts and all party MPs and MLAs will donate one month’s salary as well.“All MPs & MLAs of Bharatiya Janata Party will donate their one month remuneration/salary to the central relief fund to support the fight against Covid19. All MPs of BJP will release Rs 1 crore from their MPLADS fund to the central relief fund in support to fight against Covid-19,” he said.MPLADS is short for Members of Parliament Local Area Development Scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-cares-fund-set-up-to-meet-virus-expenses/story-oTEMWVoIk8fFSAiYM3VSjI.html
29-03-2020||India||‘Dirty politics’: Exodus of migrants from Delhi sets up AAP vs BJP on Twitter||The exodus of migrant workers from Delhi, mostly to destinations in Uttar Pradesh and some even beyond, to Bihar, saw a sea of humanity jostling to get into buses at the Delhi-UP borders. On Twitter, the criticism over the handling of the lockdown and the large-scale migration triggered a political spat between the Aam Aadmi Party which rules the national capital and the BJP, which is in power in Uttar Pradesh. Both sides accused each other of playing “dirty politics” and blamed the other for the plight of the migrant workers.It is unclear how the blame game started. But by evening, Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia and UP Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s advisor Mrityunjay Kumar appeared to be the key players. The BJP’s national secretary BL Santhosh also weighed in.Also Read: Thousands on the streets as India’s Covid-19 count crosses 1,000 Sisodia lashed out at claims by some BJP leaders in Uttar Pradesh that accused the Aam Aadmi Party government of trying to force migrant workers in the national capital to leave the city.According to one version being circulated by BJP leaders, the Delhi government had allegedly disconnected power supply to areas which had a high proportion of migrants. A second version spoke about how the city government had ferried scores of migrants to the Anand Vihar bus terminus in east Delhi, close to the border with UP.Sisodia accused the BJP’s Yogi Adityanath government of spreading lies.“I am very sad that BJP leaders are doing petty politics during the coronavirus pandemic. @myogiadityanath’s government has alleged that @ArvindKejriwal ordered to disconnect power and water supply to migrants in Delhi, forcing them to leave. It is the time to unite with seriousness to save the country, not for cheap politics,” Sisodia said in his tweet.  Yogi Adityanath’s adviser Mrityunjay launched a sharp counterattack, accusing the AAP leader of attempting to save face by issuing statements claiming the Kejriwal government had dealt with all the residents with an equal hand setting an example for other states. Mrityunjay alleged “the exodus” was engineered by the Delhi government.“This huge exodus from Delhi is your government’s doing. They neither got shelter nor food. No shelter even during rains... Yogi government made arrangements overnight to provide them with buses, shelter and food. Don’t attempt to save face by speaking untruth,” Mrityunjay tweeted.BJP leader BL Santosh waded in, blaming the city government for the exodus. There were videos of migrant voters, he said, where they were seen talking about how they had been told that there would be buses at Anand Vihar bus station to take them home.“Some forces want India to fail when #IndiaFightsCorona, Nation will not forgive them,” he tweeted, questioning how 50,000 migrant workers were allowed to break the lockdown.This wasn’t the only one spart on Twitter. There had been a sideshow of AAP vs BJP through the day that had been set off by AAP MLA Raghav Chadha’s now-deleted comment that BJP leaders alleged, accused UP Police of beating migrant workers trying to cross over to UP from Delhi.Mrityunjay said the UP government will take action against such statements.“This is downright fake news, their party is not shying away from dirty politics even at the time of such pandemic, how can the Aam Aadmi Party stoop to such lows? UP police and government will definitely act on this tweet,” he said.Click Here for Latest Reports on CoronavirusMrityunjay responded to Sisodia and accused him of attempting to save face by issuing statements claiming Kejriwal government had dealt with all the residents with an equal hand setting an example for other states. Mrityunjay alleged “the exodus” was the doing of Delhi government.“This huge exodus from Delhi is your government’s doing. They neither got shelter nor food. No shelter even during rains... Yogi government made arrangements overnight to provide them with buses, shelter and food.

29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: 7 infected in Mumbai slums, several quarantined||A 37-year-old slum dweller from Mumbai’s Jambhipada with travel history to Italy has tested positive for coronavirus and triggered panic in the city, where over five million live in slums, officials said. So far hundreds of slum dwellers have been quarantined in their homes and activists fear the Covid-19 cases could increase because of the overcrowded nature of the slums. The list of infected patients in slums includes two each from Ghatkopar and Kalina, and one each from Prabhadevi, Govandi and Cheetah Camp. A doctor, who had earlier treated the 37-year-old or influenza, has also been infected.The 37-year-old worked at a restaurant in Italy and returned to India in the second week of March and was asymptomatic when he arrived at the Mumbai airport. He later developed cold and cough and visited the doctor. When his condition did not improve, he visited the Kasturba Hospital where he was diagnosed with Covid-19.“Soon after, the doctor also started developing symptoms. On March 25, he was identified with Covid-19 after his swab test. Currently, he is undergoing treatment at Raheja Hospital. His wife and children have been found negative for the virus,” said a close friend of the doctor, who did not want to be named. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation officials have been tracking all the people, who came in contact with these two patients.A housemaid tested positive for Covid-19 worked for a US-returned couple. She lives in a Ghatkopar slum, where around 25,000 people reside. On Thursday, a 65-year-old woman, who lived in a Parel chawl and ran a food stall near a corporate house, died at the Kasturba Hospital of Covid-19. The civic body has screened over 25 people who were in close contact with her and quarantined 10. Additionally, hundreds of travellers and slum dwellers, who have been identified as close contacts, have been kept in home quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/7-infected-in-mumbai-slums-several-quarantined/story-ol3hOlIejNfW2euEcY6kJN.html

29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Centre asks states, UTs to tap SDRF to aid migrant workers||The Centre on Saturday asked the states and Union territories to provide every possible support to migrant workers, authorising them to tap the State Disaster Response Fund (SDRF) to pay for temporary accommodation, food, clothing and medical care during the three-week lockdown to halt the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.Migrant workers in the big cities, many of them daily.wage earners who have lost work and means of sustenance, have been among the hardest hit by the lockdown, which has forced thousands of them to march back home in the absence of public transportThe SDRF was constituted under the National Disaster Management Act (NDMA) in 2005 and is the primary source of funds available to state governments to combat the aftermath of disasters like cyclones, droughts, earthquakes, floods and other natural calamities The Centre contributes 75% to the SDRF for general category states and Union territories and 90% for those that come under a special category--the North-Eastern states, Sikkim, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu & Kashmir. The annual central contribution is released in two equal instalments.In its directive, the Centre said the SDRF can be used under Section 3 (a), related to relief measures listed under it and the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF). The section provides for relief in case of a calamity for 30 days. In case of the continuation of a calamity, this period may be extended first up to 60, and later to 90 days. Subsequently, medical care can be provided from the National Rural Health Mission funds, the Centre said.For 2019-20, the Centre has released around Rs 10,343 crore to 29 states as SDRF, according to official data. Around Rs 14,108 crore has been given to eight states, including Rajasthan, Odisha, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Karnataka, under the NDRF.A Press Information Bureau statement said the states have been advised to give wide publicity, using public address systems, technology, services of volunteers and non-government organizations, to precise information on the locations of relief camps set up for migrant workers and the facilities being made available there.Home minister Amit Shah said the “government has committed all support to migrant workers” who are returning to their states or trying to do so during the lockdown period.The states have been advised to set up relief camps along the highways and tented accommodation to ensure that the workers stay there until the lockdown is in place.“The shelters are to be organised, keeping in view various precautions including social distancing, with adequate medical checkup drives to identify and separate cases requiring quarantine or hospitalisation,” the statement said.Union transport minister Nitin Gadkari has separately instructed the National Highways Authority of India and toll booth operators to provide food, water and so on to migrant workers. “At this time of crisis, we have to be compassionate to our fellow citizens,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-uts-to-tap-sdrf-to-aid-migrant-workers/story-KccAd5XLRZFfL5IveidDgN.html
29-03-2020||India||57-yr-old Bengal man’s source of infection unknown||Authorities are yet to trace the source of a 57-year-old railway employee’s infection almost a week after he became the first person to die of coronavirus (Covid-19) in West Bengal with officials maintaining that his case cannot be attributed to community transmission as he had took a train from Chhattisgarh on March 2 and may have been infected in that state or the train. “This case cannot be tagged as a community transmission. Even though the victim did not travel to any foreign country and did not have a traceable contact with anyone who has returned from abroad, he had a travel history. He had been to Bilaspur in Chhattisgarh and had returned to Kolkata on March 2. He boarded the Azad Hind Express, which originated from Pune in Maharashtra,” said West Bengal health services director Ajay Chakraborty.“We still do not know the source of his infection. We are trying to trace the contact. But we believe he might have got infected on the train. We do not know whether anyone on that train had travelled abroad.”Maharasthra has the second highest number of Covid-19 cases in India, but the first was detected only on March 9, a week after the rail employee took the train that originated there. The railway employee’s son and daughter-in-law are in the US, one of the Covid-19 hotspots, but he had not met them since July 2019. “Our son, who stays in Wisconsin, USA, visited us in July last year before he went to Philadelphia... There was fake news that he lives his Italy and came to visit us with his Italian wife,” the 57-year-old’s widow said. She is living in isolation at an undisclosed location. His family has doubts over whether he indeed died of Covid19. “My husband was perfectly okay until he fell ill and had to be admitted to a hospital. Being his wife, I would have surely contracted the disease. So would have his 80-year-old mother who stays with us. I do not believe the hospital reports,” said the widow.The railway employee attended a wedding in Bilaspur on February 28 before returning to Kolkata. A member of his family said the 57-year-old and his wife stayed with him and attended the wedding at a hotel in Bilaspur. “On February 29, they took a tour of the city with their friends. They left by Azad Hind Express on March 1. Both of them were perfectly fine,” he said.The railway employee thereafter joined work on March 6, went to a shopping mall with his wife and had dinner before taking ill a day after celebrating Holi on March 10. He had a fever and was on March 16 admitted to a private hospital, where he was diagnosed Covid-19 positive on March 22. He died on March 23. At least 300 people, including his colleagues and 13 families in Chattisgarh, have been asked to stay in home quarantine. Some members of his family have been kept in isolation wards of hospitals in Kolkata.As many as 15 positive Covid-19 cases have been detected in West Bengal; 13 of them had either travelled abroad or had come in contact with people who returned from foreign countries. Two persons, including the railway employee, have not had traceable contact with anyone who may have come from abroad. A 66-year-old, who travelled to Egra in East Midnapore to attend a wedding, is another person whose source of Covid-19 infection is still unclear.

29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: 60-year-old Covid-19 positive Odisha man had visited Delhi, Haryana||A 60-year-old bank official, who tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19) in Odisha’s Bhubaneswar on Thursday, has no history of foreign travel but had travelled to Delhi and Rewari in Haryana with his wife and daughter between March 7 to March 10, officials said on Saturday. The other two people tested positive for Covid-19 in the state had returned from abroad, they added. Odisha government’s chief spokesperson, Subroto Bagchi, said the bank official, who is due to retire on March 31, flew to Delhi from Bhubaneswar with his family on March 7 and thereafter went to Rewari. On March 10, they took a flight back to Bhubaneswar, added Bagchi, who has been warning against the danger of community transmission of Covid-19 in Odisha.Bagchi said the 60-year-old visited Odisha assembly’s dispensary to see Dr Lalit Behera, his friend, when he developed cough and cold on March 13. Dr Behera was suspended on Friday for not alerting the state government as per the Covid-19 guidelines. Assembly speaker SN Patro on Friday said the assembly complex will be disinfected and it will now function from a nearby convention hall for the time being. All staff of the assembly has been told to go under quarantine. Bagchi said the bank official also went to work for about three days and when his condition did not improve, he visited a private hospital in Bhubaneswar on March 21. At least 21 doctors and other caregivers at the hospital have been put under quarantine.The bank official was admitted to another hospital on March 25 and tested positive on March 26. Bagchi said the bank official’s wife, daughter, driver and domestic help have tested negative for Covid-19.Bagchi said 100 people have been assigned to do contact tracing of the bank official. Of the 112 he came in contact with, 15 have not been traced so far. Over 78,000 migrant labourers working in worst-hit states like Kerala and Maharashtra have returned to the Odisha over the last 10 days. “The 3T rule of testing, tracing and treating has to be strictly followed to prevent a community transmission. In Odisha, we are not testing more than 50 samples a day, which is hardly enough for a huge population like ours. We need to aggressively test,” said Dr Binod Patra, a community medicine professor at Bhubaneswar’s All India Institute of Medical Sciences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-yr-old-odisha-man-had-visited-delhi-haryana/story-Ga5gDjDVrfqsHDW7GbHiDK.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Mumbai officials scramble to trace contacts of 45-yr-old man||Authorities in Mumbai are scrambling to trace the source of infection of a 45-year-old man who tested positive for Covid-19 after being turned away by the government-run Kasturba Hospital. The man has no history of travel to a global hotspot or any documented contact with a previous patient. The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has screened his children and wife but none have been found positive. Officials have also failed to trace his source of transmission. On official record, this case has been mark as ‘source of contact not available’. “Asymptomatic people can also infected other people with lower immunity. So, it is possible that he got in a close contact with any person who is carrying the virus but hasn’t shown any symptoms yet to get identified,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer. The medical education and drugs department of the Maharashtra government recently released an analysed report on 122 COVID-19 positive cases where they stated that in 6% of the reported cases in the state, the reason for infection was ‘inconclusive’. But the government dismissed speculation of community transmission occurring in the state. “So far, there is no community-based transmission reported in the state. If there had been community transmission, the number of reported cases would be increased drastically like in Italy. We are still in level-2 of transmission,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner (health), BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-officials-scramble-to-trace-contacts-of-45-yr-old-man/story-W6CVTgKwDKJkxc8lkPSMGI.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Many labs yet to begin tests for Covid-19 amid supply crunch for kits||Private laboratories allowed by the government to test for Covid-19, a move prompted by the need to expand and accelerate testing, are having a hard time in procuring testing kits which are in short supply.As a result, some of the laboratories, even with all approvals in place, have not been able to start testing; others are conducting fewer tests than what they are capable of; and still others are contemplating stopping offering tests altogether.“There is severe shortage of testing kits currently. The orders we placed earlier are not materialising. I procured about 30-40 kits that are about to run out, and fresh supply is going to take time. Even swab sticks are in short supply,” said Dr Naveen Dang, founder, Dr Dangs Lab, which was one of the first labs in Delhi to have received government approval for testing.“I am getting so many queries for testing. The phone doesn’t stop ringing, and people are getting annoyed when I tell them they will have to wait to get tested. If this continues, I might have to stop offering Covid-19 tests,” he added. Till March 28, 44 private laboratories across India received approval for testing by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s apex biomedical research organisation that is responsible for providing approvals to laboratories for Covid-19 testing in India.As per the government’s own admission on Saturday, merely 400 tests have been performed by the private labs since March 22 when the first batch of six private laboratories was approved for testing. All private laboratories together have about 20,000 collection sites that could actually double the daily capacity of testing. Currently, all 118 approved government testing labs can perform 12,000 tests in a day.The government laboratories have tested close to 28,000 sample tests so far.Testing kits are in short supply because there are not enough approved kit manufacturers, given the fact that China, the bulk exporter of raw material for drugs and diagnostic devices globally, is still trying to get back to business after the Covid-19 outbreak that originated in its city of Wuhan in December last year.“We have received the approvals but where are the kits? The system is overburdened; we placed an order for kits a week ago but are being told that the kits cannot arrive before Tuesday; and that the order could even be delayed till Thursday. Unless we get the kits, we can’t test,” said Dr DS Rana, chairman, board of governors, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.One of the primary conditions for approvals to private laboratories was that the government would share only the gene sequence of the virus for testing purposes with the private laboratories. The laboratories needed to procure everything else on their own.A spokesperson for another private hospital in the city also said that the number of tests being conducted is restricted because of the short supply of kits. “We have been doing tests for three days now, and on average 80 tests per day; however, we can do many more, if the supply of kits weren’t an issue. We have placed an order and have been assured supply by mid next week,” said the spokesperson on condition of anonymity.There are only four ICMR approved kit manufactures, of which two are Indian companies. “Of the four, one company sells kits that require special equipment for testing so it is not of any use to us. Another one is a Korean company but it hasn’t begun shipping to India yet; so we are actually left with two Indian companies that are trying to meet the high demand,” said Dr Dang.If the shortage of kits isn’t t bad enough, the staff going for home collection is also being harassed by their landlords.“Some of my home collection staff has been told by their landlords that they wouldn’t like them to continue living in their property as they are collecting samples for Covid-19 testing,” said Dr Dang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/many-labs-yet-to-begin-tests-amid-supply-crunch-for-kits/story-yudZbUWtWo8956cKALEuZI.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Has Covid-19 entered Stage 3? Experts, government disagree||Authorities in several states across India are racing to figure out how individuals with no travel history or documented contact with a Covid-19 patient contracted the infection in what several experts have termed as the deadly third stage of the disease.Such cases have been reported from all over the country: a 29-year-old rail employee in Bihar, a young political leader in Kerala, a 60-year-old bank officer in Odisha and a 57-year-old man in West Bengal being just a few examples. In none of these cases have authorities been able to find a confirmed source of the contagion.This has triggered fears that India has slipped into the community transmission phase of the disease, when the virus rapidly spreads within a community and a person with no travel history to a Covid-19-hotspot or known contact with previous patient gets infected.In this phase, undiagnosed cases infect others, making it difficult for doctors to trace, isolate and treat patients. As a result, infection clusters spiral out of control and turn into epidemics.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the apex biomedical research body in the country, there are four states of the disease. Stage 1 is getting imported cases, stage 2 is local transmission when a person whose been to a global hotspot infects a local resident, stage 3 is community transmission and stage 4 is an epidemic. Despite a number of cases of people with no known contact to an infected person or travel history, the ICMR has insisted that India is still in stage 2 as the infection is largely limited to people with a travel history and their close contacts.“There is no community transmission in India as of now, as by definition community transmission means when there is a large number of cases where you cannot trace the source. A few cases in a large country like ours where contact/source is not known doesn’t meant community transmission, it means more effort needs to go in contact tracing. It is not a simple process and at times takes time,” said Lav Aggarwal, joint secretary, ministry of health and family welfare.But experts are not convinced. They point out that because testing norms are stringent in India, and the number of tests are low – the country has one of the lowest rates of testing per capita in the world – the number of suspected community transmission cases are not likely to be high.“Unless you test, you won’t know. In the initial phase of the epidemic, there are very few cases, but once it begins, its spreads like wildfire. So testing more people holds the key. It will determine whether we go the way of Italy, or Korea,” said a senior public health expert, requesting anonymity.In the case of Italy, the country waited for too long to test people and isolate clusters. The European country now has the highest Covid-19 fatality rate in the world. In contrast, South Korea acted quickly after the first instance of community transmission and tested thousands of people every day, even setting up drive-by testing centres where people could pull up in their cars and get diagnosed.In the United States, when the first case of a person in California with no relevant travel history or exposure to another known patient showed up, it was termed a “possible instance of community spread of Covid-19 in the United States” by the US Centers for Disease Control on February 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/has-covid-19-entered-stage-3-experts-government-disagree/story-u22337reY9uO1ZSeHPIUiK.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Centre asks states to facilitate free movement of bank agents||The Union finance ministry has asked all state governments to facilitate the movement of business correspondents (BCs) and ‘bank mitras’ amid a nationwide lockdown to contain spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic so that the poor living in remote areas can get easy access to the monetary help announced by the Centre on Thursday. BCs and ‘bank mitras’ are crucial service providers in areas that do not have regular bank branches, the official said. BCs and ‘bank mitras’ are representatives or agents of a bank who, provide banking services such as account opening, cash deposit, and cash withdrawal.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman has directed the department of financial services (DFS) and state-run banks to ensure effective delivery of the Rs 1.7 lakh crore novel coronavirus (Covid-19) welfare package on Thursday, including direct cash transfer in the bank accounts of the beneficiaries, an official with direct knowledge of the matter said requesting anonymity. On Saturday monring, Sitharaman appreciated services rendered by ‘bank mitras’ and BCs across the country in a tweet. “Will talk to states -- request no restrictions in their movements. Will speak to all banks to facilitate cash flow. Let’s ensure timely access to all,” she said in a series of tweets.On Thursday, Sitharaman unveiled a Rs 1.7 lakh crore package under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana that included an additional transfer of foodgrains for the next three months, direct cash transfer to accounts of vulnerable sections of the society and insurance support to those in the frontline of the battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.Sitharaman said BCs and ‘bank mitras’, serving unbankable areas, are taking every precaution to check the spread of the virus while serving customers. “Here are just two examples of Bank Mitras in Purulia, West Bengal & Beed, Maharashtra. Brave men & women like these around the country are bringing the bank to you in a safe manner—armed with a bucket, soap, sanitiser & bank kiosk kit,” she tweeted. The package announced on Thursday also included direct financial support to the poor hit hard by the pandemic. The financial support includes payment of an ex-gratia amount of Rs 1,000 to 30 million vulnerable people, such as economically poor widows, senior citizens above the age of 60, and the physically challenged. Besides, Rs 500 will be paid per month to 200 million women Jan Dhan accountholders for the next three months. ‘Bank mitras’ and BCs of banks largely provide services to such people.The government has also assured citizens that there will not be any disruption in essential banking services at branches and all automated teller machines (ATMs) will function normally. Several banks are, however, rationalising branch operations to minimise physical interactions of their employees to protect them from the Covid-19 outbreak.To facilitate customers in getting banking and insurance-related information, the department of financial services (DFS) has created a new twitter handle “@DFSFightsCorona”. Customers can route complaints and queries against banks to the government directly through this handle, a finance ministry spokesperson said.Late in the evening, the finance minister also spoke to chairperson and managing directors (CMDs) of public sector banks on issues related to bank branches serving customers, he said.After hearing some problems faced by certain bank branches in Punjab due to the lockdown, Sitharaman spoke to Punjab chief minister Capt. Amarinder Singh. The chief minister has assured her to facilitate banks, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-states-to-facilitate-free-movement-of-bank-agents/story-C6tKAaOXRAwQ7MiKq9sSEI.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Concerns over superspreaders rise as many breach quarantine||Kolkata/Pune: A 29-year-old woman, who was asked to stay in quarantine at home but violated the instructions and travelled by two trains from New Delhi to reach West Bengal’s Tehatta, has tested positive for Covid-19 along with her four family members and mounted concerns about super-spreaders of the infection. What has complicated matters is that the people who came in contact with the family are refusing to admit they did so. The district administration has appealed to the local residents to voluntarily disclose whether they came in contact with the family so that it could put in place measures to prevent the spread of the disease. A health official said the 29-year-old had on March 16 met a cousin in New Delhi, who had returned from the UK, following which she was advised to stay in-home quarantine. The five were at their relative’s place in Tehatta between March 20 and 24 until being hospitalised after reporting symptoms of Covid-19. A number of the family’s relatives living in Tehatta have been isolated and their blood samples sent for tests. The results are awaited.Ajay Chakraborty, director of health services, said the Delhi police should have informed them about the 29-year-old’s violation of the quarantine instructions.In Maharashtra’s Sangli, four members of a family, who have tested Covid-19 positive, had returned from Saudi Arabia on March 14 and mingled with other people for the four days in absence of instructions for home quarantine. Sangli district collector Abhijeet Chaudhari said the four were not on the list of people shared with them with foreign travel history. “We got to know about the foreign visit of this family locally following which we collected their swabs for testing even as none of the four showed any symptoms,” said Chaudhari.On March 22, the four tested positive and prompted the administration to put at least 47 people under home quarantine. “Of the 47 samples collected, 24 tested positive and rest negative. Considering that the positive cases who did not go to Mecca [Saudi Arabia] may have also come in contact with other relatives, we home quarantined around 300 and are monitoring them,” said Chaudhari.Maharashtra minister Jayant Patil said they have put in place a containment programme under which only one person from one family is being allowed to step out for buying essentials. Around 500 families have been notified to stay at home and the city administration has to ensure supply of essentials for them. The entry and exit points to the city have been sealed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerns-over-superspreaders-rise-as-many-breach-quarantine/story-eo9a6Lc87wmNLHwDH5csGO.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Delhi eating joint employee walks 200 km to reach home, dies on the road||A 38-year-old man who had walked 200 km from the national capital to reach home died on the Delhi-Agra highway on Saturday morning. Ranveer Singh’s destination, his family in a remote village in Madhya Pradesh’s Morena district, was still 100 km away.The two men, who were accompanying Ranveer Singh, told the police that Ranveer Singh complained of chest pain sometime before he collapsed a short distance.The death is the first recorded fatality among the tens of thousands – some estimates put the numbers into six digits – of migrant workers walking back to their villages for food and shelter after losing work in metropolitan cities during the three-week lockdown put in place to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Also Watch | Migrants’ exodus: Government’s damage controlRanveer Singh had decided to walk home after the government suddenly imposed a national lockdown, ordering shops and offices to close. Eating joints were allowed to stay open provided they don’t serve but deliver the food to customers. But in the initial days of the lockdown, the police wouldn’t let them operate.Also read: India registers 179 new cases, PM creates special relief fund to fight Covid-19Agra district police chief Babloo Kumar said the restaurant in south Delhi’s Tughlakabad locality where Ranveer Singh worked had shut down.Like the thousands of migrant workers in and around Delhi who have been struggling to go home, Ranveer Singh also decided to go home. Since the government had stopped public transport services - buses and trains - his only option appeared to be to travel the 300 km by foot.“Ranveer was accompanied by two others from Delhi and was walking towards his village in Morena district of Madhya Pradesh. On reaching Agra on Saturday morning, he complained of chest pain. So all three stopped on the outskirts of Agra but Ranveer collapsed,” the senior police officer said.Also read: Amid lockdown, a sea of migrants in Delhi try to find their way back homeA local shopkeeper came to help the three.

The post-mortem was conducted on Saturday and body was handed over to family members who turned up from the village,” said Arvind Kumar, the Station House Officer of Sikandra police station.Police has informed the dead man’s family after getting their contact details from his phone.

29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: UP ramps up evacuation of workers from Delhi-NCR||The Delhi-Uttar Pradesh (UP) border saw an uptick in reverse migration to the country’s most populous state on Saturday morning, as hundreds of workers continued their march home after their livelihood options dried up and savings were exhausted amid the 21-day nationwide lockdown that started Wednesday to tackle the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak.The UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) authorities have been ferrying migrants to their destinations from Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts, which share borders with Delhi. “This situation arose after the word was circulated among our people (migrant workers) in Delhi that buses were being operated for them to take them to their home. Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) even dropped them at the Delhi-UP border, despite the lockdown, leaving them all in the lurch. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath held an emergency meeting and decided that the government could not leave its people like this. The transport department was asked to ferry them home,” UP minister of state for transport (Independent) Ashok Katariya said.“We are operating 1,000 buses to pick passengers from different cities and drop them at their destinations. Till 4pm today, we have already transported 22,000 such passengers. The buses operated all night. We are providing them with food and water also at bus stations. We are in a lockdown and are not supposed to operate buses. But this is an emergency situation. On humanitarian grounds, we are providing conveyance to people who have moved to UP from Delhi and other states. We think we may have to operate buses till tomorrow (Sunday) and then we pack up,” he added.The Uttar Pradesh government arranged 1,000 buses to ferry the workers. Ghaziabad subdivisional magistrate, Devendra Pal, on Saturday night, said that an estimated 400-500 buses had started from Kaushambi, but the figure for Lal Kuan was not readily available.Officials of the UPSRTC’s Ghaziabad region said that till Friday midnight, 96 buses had started their trips and they are arranging more. “We have sent 79 buses on Saturday, till 11.30am, to Lucknow, Etawah, Bareilly, Etah, Aligarh and Gorakhpur, besides nearby places. We will continue sending buses till all the stranded workers reach home. Bus services have resumed from the interstate bus terminus (ISBT) in Kaushambi,” said AK Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC.“We sent 96 buses from Lal Kuan intersection till Friday night and more buses are being arranged from other depots. We had arranged for 200 buses on Friday, but the police stopped some of them because of orders that people should stay put at their respective places due to the lockdown. However, we received orders to resume services late Friday,” he said.Migrant workers started moving to their home towns on Tuesday, after Prime Minister Narendra Modi ordered a nationwide lockdown.“Around 40,000-50,000 workers were lined up on Delhi-UP border on Saturday evening. They are still coming in large numbers. The social distancing is openly being flouted as the workers are in a hurry to catch the first bus to their home towns,” said VK Mittal, the president of Kaushambi apartments’ RWA, an apex body of Kaushambi Township. Migrant workers such as Mohammad Fakhruddin, who came to Lal Kuan in Ghaziabad from Tank Road in central Delhi’s Karol Bagh, said that he was waiting for his bus to arrive. “I have to go to Badaun, my home town. Another 10 people will be travelling with me. I work for a garment manufacturing unit, which makes denim jeans. However, our work has stopped due to the lockdown. The landlord is asking for rent and I have no money to pay. My family and I have decided to move back to our home town until the crisis blows over. We came to Lal Kuan by a UP Roadways bus. From ISBT Kaushambi, we will board another bus to Badaun,” he said.Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey denied that the migrants were stopped at the border. “Nobody has been stopped at the Delhi-UP borders,” he said.Those who had come to catch the buses from Lal Kuan even complained that some private vehicle owners were charging high fares. “A few private vehicles are also available, but they told me that I have to shell out ₹1,000 for a drop to my home town. Many are engaging mini trucks, commercial trucks, milk vans and other commercial vehicles, risking their safety. Trains are also not available. As a result, people have no option to wait for the UP government buses and pay a normal fare,” said Atul Kumar, a call centre employee travelling to Etawah. The police also extended a helping hand to the workers. “It’s a massive crisis for these poor people. They started coming in groups of 25 to 30 and were walking towards Hapur, Moradabad, etc. We have helped many of them board empty trucks and other commercial vehicles, as they could be dropped off near their home towns,” a police officer said. Good Samaritans are distributing cooked food to them near Masuri on NH-9. “The workers have started coming again. We are preparing about 300 boxes of food for them. We helped about 300 workers board their respective buses from Friday evening,” Maurya said. In Gautam Budh Nagar, the UPSRTC has provided about 200 buses to help stranded migrant workers reach home. “These buses are leaving every two hours, starting at 8am on Saturday. We will run the service for the next 48 hours,” said Sankalp Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Noida. He said all district and administrative authorities have been instructed to allow these buses to travel on a priority basis. “We have also requested that the passengers be provided with food and medical facilities The buses will drop the passengers at different interstate borders in UP. The passengers can avail of the transportation facilities being provided by the state governments of their respective states,” he said.The DCP said that all DMs have been requested to record the details of the buses reaching their respective districts on Saturday and Sunday. “The DMs have been asked to make arrangements for medical screening of all the passengers at their destination points, maintaining their full details, including names, addresses and mobile phone numbers. It will help us in monitoring and supervising these passengers at a later stage,” Sharma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-ramps-up-evacuation-of-workers-from-delhi-ncr/story-4UzfBrnWLSAiYZP5endt7O.html
29-03-2020||India||Coronavirus update: Don’t evict tenants for not paying rent, Noida landlords told||Authorities in Gautam Budh Nagar have issued an order directing landlords against forcing tenants to pay their rents for a month to stop migrant workers from leaving the western Uttar Pradesh district amid the three-week lockdown imposed across the country to halt the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic.Migrant workers have been among the hardest hit because of the lockdown. Many of them have been prompted to undertake long journeys to their homes on foot in absence of public transport, work and means to sustain themselves.In an order, a copy of which HT has seen, district magistrate B N Singh has warned of legal action against landlords found flouting the order under the National Disaster Management Act (NDMA). It added the order applies to both landlords of daily wage workers as well as the employees of companies involved in essential services.The lockdown was imposed from Wednesday under the NDMA, which provides for up to two-year imprisonment for anyone violating its provisions.Officials said the order has been issued to ensure the essential services are also not impacted in absence of daily wage workers and employees attached with them.Migrant workers have also been trying to leave the district adjoining Delhi and Singh said their movement could also lead to the spread of Covid-19. So, it is important to ensure that people have food and roofs over their heads, said Singh.“We are expecting this move will encourage migrants to not leave their houses and the district. We will lodge FIR [First Information Reports] against landlords who will not follow the order. Strict legal action will be taken under the Disaster Management Act,” said Singh.Officials have provided a helpline number (1120-2544700) for tenants on which they can register complaints if they are harassed over rent. They added landlords can ask for rents after a month only if authorities allow them to.Maya Rani, who works as a housemaid in Noida’s Sector 137, said she lives on rent with her family of seven members in nearby Shahdara village and they were worried how would they be able to pay their rent on April 1. “If the district magistrate’s order is followed then at least we will get some relief,” said Rani, who is from Madhya Pradesh.Sachin Bhati, a resident of Noida’s Sector 142, said many people living in his neighbourhood are trying their best to reach their villages because of financial as well as health crises. “This decision of the administration is a relief but it will be great if they arrange vehicles for these people to reach their villages. Migrants really want to go back to their loved ones and homes to feel comfortable,” he said.The district administration has also formed committees led by sub-divisional magistrates to ensure that migrants are getting food and are not harassed. “I have been providing food packets to around 5,000 migrants daily. There are migrants in every part of the district whom we are trying to reach out with food. Many locals are providing for these people,” said Rajiv Rai, sub-divisional magistrate, Dadri who is responsible for providing food to migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/don-t-evict-tenants-for-not-paying-rent-gb-nagar-to-landlords/story-2GZrtk7niwnMUGbjjsgwVO.html
29-03-2020||India||Bihar officials yet to find source of railway employee’s Covid-19 infection||A 29-year-old junior railway employee, who reached Patna by train from Bhavnagar in Gujarat on March 9, may be the first case of community transmission of the Covid-19 virus in Bihar, where health authorities are now struggling to identify the source of infection. They are even struggling to establish who he came in contact with, but deny that he caught the infection through community transmission. Exactly one week before he tested positive for the coronavirus disease on March 24, the man attended a wedding at a community hall in Patna to which the bridegroom’s retinue travelled from Dildarnagar in Uttar Pradesh. The railway employee complained of cough and fever and was admitted to a private medical facility in Patna late on March 22. The next morning, doctors at the facility, who suspected he was suffering from Covid-19, referred him for admission to the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH). The same day, doctors at NMCH, designated the special coronavirus hospital in Patna, sent his sample to the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute of Medical Sciences (RMRIMS) in Bihar’s Agam Kuan, and he tested positive on March 24.Community transmission of the virus is suspected when a person who has tested positive for Covid-19 has no recent history of travel to a country hit by the pandemic, and has had no known contacts with someone who has been on an overseas visit. The source of the infection cannot be traced in such a case.“The railway employee came to Patna by train from Bhavnagar on March 9. We have been able to trace the [railway] guard who he came in contact with. However, mapping all the guests he came in contact with during the wedding on March 17 remains the biggest challenge for us,” said a district health official, requesting anonymity.Patna civil surgeon Dr Raj Kishore Chaudhary accepted that his office had been unable to trace all the people the railway employee came in contact with.“We are unable to trace 29 people who he came in contact with during the wedding. Some of them may even be from UP, where the baraat came from,” said Dr Chaudhary.He, however, denied it was a case of community transmission of the disease.“The affected person has a travel history in Gujarat. We do not know where he contacted the virus from, whether it was in Gujarat or in the train, because the railway employee is reluctant to talk to us and was even concealing facts initially. It is only when the virus gets transmitted through him to other people he came in contact with that we are going to call it community transmission of the virus,” added Dr Chaudhary. “So far, we have tested the samples of his mother, two brothers and three sisters and all have tested negative. We have taken samples of the staff of Patliputra Utsav hall, where he attended the wedding. We are now in the process of collecting the oropharyngeal sample of his father, who is attending to the patient at the isolation ward of the NMCH,” the Patna civil surgeon added. Bihar’s principal secretary (health) Sanjay Kumar had, on Friday, denied any case of community transmission of the virus so far in Bihar. He said, “Community transfer is when the source of the virus is untraceable.”Efforts to reach him for comment on Saturday failed.“Of the nine Covid-19 cases in Bihar, four have international travel history while one has come from coronavirus-affected Gujarat,” said Dr Nirmal Kumar Sinha, medical superintendent of the 850-bed NMCH.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-officials-yet-to-find-source-of-railway-employee-s-covid-19-infection/story-QT0NuIl8q3fW1dDwA9UuCO.html
29-03-2020||India||At govt hospitals, guidelines for separate treatment for those with and without Covid-19||To prepare for an expected surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, the Centre has issued guidelines to staff of government hospitals to ensure separate treatment of people with and without the infection. According to the plan, hospitals need to be divided into three zones – non-Covid-19 areas, Covid-19 areas treating people with mild to moderate infection and critical areas like the intensive care units (ICU).A triage facility has to be set up at the entrance of the emergency department to segregate those with acute respiratory problems, according to a copy of the guidelines seen by Hindustan Times. Delhi’s Lok Nayak hospital has already started screening patients coming in for emergency and routine treatment.“Our general out-patient clinics are still running and to ensure that there is no spread of the infection, a team of doctors segregates the patients who are suspected to have the disease and those who are not. The suspect patients are directly taken to the Covid-19 treatment area, the others are allowed to go to the clinics,” a senior official at the hospital said on condition of anonymity.The guidelines say that staff must be divided into core departments like medicine, pulmonology and geriatric units that will lead the teams treating those with mild to moderate symptoms of Covid-19 and be involved in the care of critically ill patients.Those from departments like cardiology, neurology, paediatric and the respective surgical divisions who know how to run an ICU will lead the screening teams and be posted at in the critical area with those from the core departments.Doctors from other clinical specialities like rheumatology, endocrinology and gynaecology will be included in the screening teams and in the teams taking care of the mild to moderately sick, according to the document listing the guidelines.Dentists may later be included for the treatment as well if the number of cases starts rising. They have to be trained in infection control measures from now to ensure they are prepared if the need for their deployment arises, according to the guidelines.As for nursing staff, the guidelines suggest that in case of a surge in the number of patients, nursing students be enlisted.Hospitals across the country have started preparing for a surge in the number of cases, with many states designating dedicated hospitals for treating just Covid-19 patients. Delhi is opening up one of its newly constructed hospitals with 1,000 beds for the management of Covid-19 patients alone. Along with that, two existing hospitals are working towards becoming Covid-19 only in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-govt-hospitals-guidelines-for-separate-treatment-for-those-with-and-without-covid-19/story-yWOrsDALw8mRBS4IQjHAPM.html
