He also ordered priority testing for anyone in the above group displaying Covid-19 symptoms.Reviewing the coronavirus containment measures, Nitish asked health department officials to ensure that the second leg of the intensive door-to-door screening exercise ring fenced the ‘vulnerable’ categories from the infection through proper identification and testing protocols.For Coronavirus Live Updates“In view of the increase in the number of Covid-19 positive cases, immediate measures for augmenting the required health facilities, including adequate isolation wards and beds, should be initiated to ensure that there is no difficulty in their treatment,” Nitish said, while urging people to reach out for healthcare support as soon as they notice any symptoms.Insisting on the need for a massive awareness drive to involve the people in the fight against the disease, the chief minister asked for roping in elected representatives of panchayati raj institutions and urban local bodies.“The idea is to impress upon the masses that the use of face masks, observance of social distancing norms, following government guidelines and testing were the four key tools in fighting the pandemic,” the chief minister said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“Preventive steps are the key to staying safe. But if someone displays symptoms, he should immediately come forward for Covid-19 test and get treated in the event of a positive report, without wasting any time. All those staying at home quarantine, too, should follow the same approach. This is necessary to keep your family and neigbourhood safe,” he said.As a large number of migrant workers, including Covid-19 patients, are returning home after serving the mandatory quarantine period and or successful treatment, the chief minister appealed that they should not be subjected to any form of social stigmatisation.He also directed officials to expand the free distribution of face masks and soaps in the rural pockets to include poor families, rickshaw pullers, daily wage earners, street vendors and other needy persons living in urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-shifts-focus-on-the-vulnerable-in-2nd-phase-of-door-to-door-screening/story-UWMqkzSsBYjHcp50LMeixK.html
02-06-2020||India||Enforcement Directorate files chargesheet against P Chidambaram, son Karti in INX Media case||The Enforcement Directorate has filed charges against former finance minister P Chidambaram and son Karti in the INX Media case, people familiar with the development said. The charge-sheet was filed in special judge Ajay Kumar’s court on Tuesday.The ED, a federal agency that investigates financial crimes and money laundering, has accused the 74-year-old veteran Congress politician and Karti of being beneficial owners of shell firms incorporated in India and abroad that received bribes.There has been no statement from the ED detailing provisions of the money laundering law that the two Congress leaders that have been invoked in the charge-sheet. But the Enforcement Directorate has alleged in the past that nearly Rs 3 crore had been paid to Karti Chidambaram’s companies by INX Media co-founder, Peter Mukerjea. This money was allegedly paid at the behest of the senior Congress politician who was the finance minister when approvals to receive foreign investments were granted to INX Media.P Chidambaram was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in October last year when he was in Tihar jail. The arrest came around the same time that his bail application in a related case filed by the CBI was coming up for hearing. The Rajya Sabha MP was eventually released in December 2019 after spending nearly 105 days in Tihar jail.The former Union minister and his son have repeatedly denied the allegations.Also Read: ‘P Chidambaram, Karti met Mukerjeas, officials buried violations’: CBI in INX charge sheetAsked about the charge-sheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate, Karti Chidabaram declined to say anything. “I will not comment until something is served to me formally,” he said.The ED and CBI cases are linked to grant of Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance to INX Media to receive overseas funds to the tune of Rs 307 crore in 2007, when the Congress politician was finance minister in the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government.Investigators have alleged that when Peter Mukerjea and wife Indrani met Chidambaram to get the foreign investment approvals, the minister told them to keep his son’s business interests in mind. At earlier court hearings, the ED has claimed that they had been able to identify payments of “Rs 3.09 crore by Peter Mukerjea to ASCPL (Advantage Strategic Consultancy Pvt Ltd) and associated entities controlled by Karti P Chidambaram through manipulated debit notes.”“During investigation, it was admitted that debit notes were raised on the directions of Karti Chidambaram to show some transaction which in fact did not occur,” the agency had alleged. It said the money so received by associated entities was channelled back into ASCPL.“The funds received by ASCPL were invested and ASCPL also purchased shares of Vasan Health Care. A part of these shares was sold at a profit of nearly Rs 41 crore. ASCPL also earned Rs.18.49 crore from sale of shares in another company for an amount of Rs 29.49 crore. These funds arising from sale of laundered property is also property involved in money laundering,” it has claimed.The agency had, in February 2019, attached properties worth Rs 54 crore allegedly belonging to Karti in Spain, the UK and India.Indrani Mukherjea, in her statement to CBI, has claimed that US dollars 5 million and US dollars 4,50,000 were transferred in overseas account of Congress leader in 2007 and 2009 respectively after getting money from INX’s foreign investors while a cash payment of Rs 1 crore was made to Karti in Delhi in 2009. HT has copy of her statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/enforcement-directorate-files-chargesheet-against-p-chidambaram-son-karti-in-inx-media-case/story-wGbl0qRBX85OaNQWAVVEBK.html
02-06-2020||India||31 Covid-19 cases outside quarantine centres in Odisha trigger concerns of community transmission||For the first time since migrant workers started arriving in Odisha on May 1, the state on Tuesday reported 31 cases of local infections triggering apprehension among experts that community transmission may have set in.The health and family welfare department said 146 Covid-19 cases were reported on Tuesday across the State taking the total to 2,245. Over 95 per cent of the total cases in Odisha have been reported from quarantine centres housing 115 migrant workers, several of whom have carried the disease from outside, however, 31 cases reported today were locals without any travel history.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThis is the first time that such a large number of locals have tested positive since May 1- when the migrant workers started arriving in Odisha after the lockdown norms were eased. Since May 5, when the returning migrant workers started testing positive in a large number, the number of infections among locals has been limited to anything between 2 and 10 and on some days no local tested positive. The Odisha government, too, has been indicating that there was no need to worry since the bulk of the cases were confined to quarantine centres through a successful execution of government strategy.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19But with 31 local infections on Tuesday, epidemiologist Binod Patra of AIIMS Bhubaneswar said it was not a good sign. “Community infection may not have happened right now, but 31 local infections on a single day shows local infections have begun. Despite the official claim that the infection is under control as migrant workers are being quarantined, it may not be happening on the ground as many of the returning workers seem to be infecting locals by not obeying the guidelines. This would lead to an explosive situation this month and July,” he warned.On Monday, Odisha announced stricter guidelines for 11 districts, including the six coastal districts that now account for 80 per cent of the total cases, ordering complete shutdown on Saturdays and Sundays. Though the order has been opposed by people all across the state, chief secretary Asit Tripathy said it was essential as cases will peak in Odisha in June and thus the next 3 weeks are crucial. As per the government, the shutdown was necessary to reduce social contact in 11 districts where most of the migrant workers have arrived.However, virologist T Jacob John of CMC Vellore said there was no doubt that community transmission had started in Odisha.“Community transmission happened the day migrant workers started arriving in Odisha in large numbers as there were media reports of many of them jumping quarantine centres and trains. Community transmission is occurring in Gujarat, Chennai, Maharashtra and Delhi since March. As 80 per cent of the infected people are asymptomatic, how would the government know that community transmission has not happened,” he asked.The virologist said Odisha’s 4,000 tests a day was not enough to rule out community transmission as the state was only testing symptomatic people in quarantine centres. “The government needs to test more people outside the quarantine centre and do more contact tracing to find out the extent of spread. But there is no doubt that community transmission has started in Odisha like other States,” he said.But Dr Jayant Panda, technical advisor to the health department on Covid-19 matters denied the possibility of any community transmission in Odisha despite 31 local infections being reported. “The 31 cases that we found today were from the high risk contacts of the positive cases in the quarantine centres. So far there is no community transmission. As advised by the ICMR, we would do Sero tests among people to see whether community transmission has happened,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/31-covid-19-cases-outside-quarantine-centres-in-odisha-trigger-concerns/story-Wh5mcX0W02NfYu0vDTI54L.html
02-06-2020||India||Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar takes on Mamata Banerjee’s govt over universities||A day after appointing Professor Goutam Chandra as pro-Vice Chancellor of Burdwan University West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar locked horns with the Mamata Banerjee administration yet again on Tuesday over the way state-run state universities are functioning.While in December 2019, the Bengal government had introduced a rule asking state-run universities to route all their communications with the governor through the higher education department, Dhankhar on Tuesday issued an order setting aside the six-month old rule.“Such communications are not required to be routed through any authority. Several vice chancellors have routed communications through the higher education department quoting provisions of the 2019 rules. Such a stance betrays lack of appreciation that no rule can override a provision of the Act,” the Governor’s order said.The governor by virtue of his position is the chancellor of all state-run universities. On Monday, Dhankhar appointed Professor Goutam Chandra as the pro vice-chancellor of Burdwan University without consulting the state administration. State education minister Partha Chatterjee called the governor a ‘BJP man’.“This is very unfortunate. We sent him our choice, but he appointed a person not on the list. He always wanted to appoint people loyal to the BJP. This is not done. We will not accept him in that position. The governor should have remembered that the government pays his salaries,” said Chatterjee.Ever since he assumed office on July 30, 2019, Dhankhar has been at loggerheads with the ruling Trinamool Congress TMC on a host of issues. Chief minister Mamata Banerjee once called him “an agent” of the Centre.In December 2019 the higher education department issued a gazette notification that abolished the chancellor’s secretariat, reduced the chancellor’s role in choosing vice-chancellors, took away his power to convene meetings of the highest bodies of the universities or take action against vice-chancellors.The Bharatiya Janata Party lashed out at the TMC for changing the protocol and accused it of neither abiding by tradition nor the Constitution.“Will they not abide by any tradition? Will they not follow what’s in the Constitution? It is the governor’s right,” said Rahul Sinha, national secretary of the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/governor-jadgeep-dhankhar-takes-on-mamata-banerjee-s-govt-over-universities/story-bc2NdjLIO7EtBY71Wfx6uN.html
02-06-2020||India||How five states in India are leading economy to recovery from lockdown||Five Indian states contributing nearly 27% of the country’s gross domestic product are leading a recovery in the economy as it slowly emerges from the world’s biggest lockdown, a study by Elara Securities Inc. shows.Kerala, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Haryana and Karnataka have seen a pickup in activity, based on an analysis of indicators such as power consumption, traffic movement, arrival of farm products at wholesale markets and Google mobility data, Garima Kapoor, an economist at Elara Securities in Mumbai, wrote in a note.Some of the most industrialized states such as Maharashtra and Gujarat were trailing because of tough measures still in place to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, she said.India will begin a phased lifting of the nationwide lockdown from June 8, allowing shopping malls, restaurants and places of worship to reopen in areas where virus infections are under control.“The best stimulus India can have is resumption of normal economic activity,” Kapoor said. “The country is witnessing an improvement in activity but it remains sporadic.”Punjab and Haryana were among states that saw an improvement in electricity requirement, reflecting demand from farm operations, the study showed. National capital Delhi also showed an increase in power demand as well as mobility trends.Kapoor examined Google search trends to see if consumers are shifting consumption patterns as they adapt to a “new way of life.”The analysis showed there was pent-up demand for salon services, air conditioners, air travel, bikes, vacuum cleaners and washing machines. Searches associated with panic-buying when the lockdown was first announced -- such as pharmacy and grocery stores and liquid soaps -- have eased. Consumers haven’t given up looking for items such as earphones, hair oil, laptops, mobile phones, jewelery, mops, toys and microwave ovens.“We anticipate demand to persist in the upcoming months, as some are virus-related shifts in patterns,” Kapoor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-five-states-in-india-are-leading-economy-to-recovery-from-lockdown/story-TMqx6WJ5q7LBqxxZKOKURO.html

Only a limited number of people would be allowed at a time, duly maintaining a physical distance of 6 feet between persons at all times and all points,” Prasad said.The TTD will take a call on resumption of darshan of Lord for all the other pilgrims after assessing the situation during the trial run.The Tirumala was shut on March 19. This is for the first time in the history of the temple that it was closed for darshan for such a long period.The endowments department is yet to take a decision on opening of other temples. However, last month, the department suggested a series of measures to be followed in all major temples in the state which had been closed since March 20, prior to the imposition of nationwide lockdown.According to the instructions issued by the department to the temple authorities, devotees intending to have darshan of the deity should book the time slot for the same in advance. The time slot allotments would be made a day in advance and communicated to the devotees by way of text messages to their mobiles.The devotees have to produce Aadhaar card as an ID proof at the time of coming for darshan as per the time slot allotted to them. The darshans would be provided only from 6 am to 6 pm. “On an average, not more than 250 devotees would be allowed per hour for darshan,” the circular said.Unlike in the past, devotees cannot enter into inner circles of the temple (Antaralaya darshanams) or sanctum sanctorum (Garbhalaya darshanams) at least for the time being. They would also not be blessed with Satari (a replica of Lord’s feet to be placed on the head of devotee) or offered Teertham (Holy water) as minimum physical distance has to be maintained for the safety of Archakas (priests).The temple authorities have also been asked to ensure adequate safety measures in the temples so as to avoid spread of virus. Every temple should plan installation of disinfectant tunnels wherever feasible so that devotees can pass through them before entering the temple.They should also have facilities for the devotees to wash their feet and with soaps, besides sanitisers with stands at all entry points. All devotees should invariably wear face masks which should be readily available in sufficient numbers for sale in the nearby shops.The temple authorities shall workout methods for maintaining minimum physical distance of 6 ft between two devotees at any given point of time. They shall also examine the feasibility of arranging queue lines with alternative materials like queue makers (like in airports), instead of metal railings.In order to mobilise financial resources, the endowments department has also asked the temple authorities to increase online subscriptions for in-absentia pujas (Paroksha Seva) in their respective temples and give publicity for such worship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirumala-temple-opens-on-june-8-devotees-told-to-keep-6ft-distance/story-FLBNHEKyi5m2QNA78kcAoJ.html

This includes 52 deaths, 2,339 active cases and 1,403 patients who have been discharged after being cured.Of the new cases on Tuesday, all but 20 patients were people who had returned to Karnataka from Maharashtra, the worst-affected state in the country.The maximum -150 cases - were reported from Udupi district where a large number of people, working in the hotel industry in Mumbai, have come back in the last few weeks.Kalburgi, Yadigiri, Mandya, Hassan and Bangalore are the other districts that account for the bulk of the active cases in Karnataka.A health department official who did not want to be identified as he is not authorised to speak to the media, claimed that the state had done relatively well compared to other major counterparts across the country. “There is no organic transmission at a large scale happening here. The spurt is primarily because of people who have returned from Maharashtra. If we were to bar everybody coming from that state alone, we would have seen hardly 20 cases today.”The state government has made it compulsory for anybody coming from Maharashtra to undergo one week of institutional quarantine, a requirement which is not there for travellers from any other part of the country.The record spurt in cases came on a day when Karnataka’s health and family welfare minister B Sriramulu found himself at the centre of a controversy for reportedly flouting social distancing norms at an event in Chitradurga district.In a video, the minister was seen mobbed by hundreds of supporters and party workers, taken in a procession and garlanded while participating in a function to offer prayers to the Vedavati river in the district. Not everyone present was wearing a face mask or observing social distancing norms.The main opposition Congress has demanded the resignation of the minister and asked the Yediyurappa government to take action against him as per the law. However, the government was yet to react to the opposition charges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-388-new-covid-19-positive-cases-karnataka-sees-biggest-single-day-spike/story-xrSUseVCdQ17zl1Moz0T9I.html

Both leaders have been votaries of reforms in the WHO but have chosen to take a vastly different approach. US President Donald Trump has threatened to exit the global health body to push the WHO to carry out the reforms. PM Modi, in contrast, has decided to push hard on reforms while staying as part of the WHO.Also Read: India is sensitive to China but won’t allow change in any border sector | AnalysisPM Modi also expressed concern regarding the ongoing civil disturbances in the US, conveyed his best wishes for an early resolution of the situation, a PMO statement said.“The phone conversation underscores that even in such an unsettled world and the changing dynamics in the post-Covid-19 pandemic, the relationship between India and the United States remains strong,” a top government functionary told Hindustan Times. The richness and depth of India-US consultations will remain an important pillar of the post-COVID global architecture.“The Indo-US relationship is at a historic high,” a second official said. He explained.“When was the last time that a prime minister of India spoke about civil disturbances in the US and expressed confidence that the US President would be able to handle it. Or when did the US President call the Indian Prime Minister during a serious border standoff. All this shows that both the leaders have taken the relationship to a very different level,” he said.Donald Trump had first given an indication of his intent to invite India to the G-7 on Saturday when he described the grouping of the seven countries - some of them among the most advanced economies of the world - as “outdated” and advocated rechristening it as “G-10 or G-11” to include India, Australia, South Korea and Russia.“We want Australia, we want India, we want South Korea. And what do we have? That’s a nice group of countries right there,” he had said, hinting that the heads of these nations could be invited for the next summit to be hosted by the US on a reschedule date in September or November.Prime Minister Modi commended President Trump for his creative and far-sighted approach, acknowledging that such an expanded forum would be in keeping with the emerging realities of the post-Covid world. PM Modi said that India would be happy to work with the US and other countries to ensure the success of the proposed Summit.The G-7 currently includes the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. India is a member of the larger version of the body that is called the G-20. However, according to an aide of the US President quoted by HT earlier, Trump’s plan seems to bring together important allies on a platform to deal with China, a country with which the United States’ relations have gone from bad to worse under the Trump administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-phone-call-to-pm-modi-us-president-donald-trump-invites-india-to-next-g-7-summit-in-usa/story-GZ3bRMQMQOwBOSLsg0i4fI.html
02-06-2020||India||MP Raj Bhawan delisted as containment zone in 5 days, Congress protests||The Madhya Pradesh Congress has alleged that the decision to denotify the containment zone at the Raj Bhawan campus, the official residence of the state governor, is tied to the cabinet expansion plan of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan. The decision to place it under the containment zone was taken just five days ago.“The district administration in Bhopal denotified the containment zone at the Raj Bhavan campus on Monday evening, within five days of its notification, at the instance of the BJP government to facilitate expansion of Shivraj Singh Chouhan cabinet which is expected anytime,” said state Congress leader and MLA PC Sharma.Such decisions, the MLA said, corroborated their charge that the BJP government is not serious about the lives of people and is only focused on political gains.Notably, an official release from directorate of public relations ,on Monday night, stated, “Raj Bhavan has become containment free area. All the 10 persons infected with Covid-19 are under treatment in hospitals. Members of other 10 families of containment zone have been shifted to a quarantine centre.”After six Covid-19 patients were identified on the Raj Bhavan campus on Wednesday, the area around the patients’ houses was declared as a containment zone by the district administration.“The area covered under practical distance from these houses (10/0 to 10/9) which have been declared as epicentre, is being declared as a containment area,” read the district administration order rather than declaring the area within one kilometre radius as part of the containment zone.The order also said that the practical distance would be earmarked by the chief medical health officer (CMHO) and the RRT (rapid response team).“Containment area is defined as marking of first contact areas of the reported positive case,” said the order.The decision regarding the practical demarcation means that the main building on the campus, which is hardly 500 meters away from the employee quarters, is not covered under the containment zone. The area has been notified as containment zone free, said a district administration officer who did not wish to be named.Tarun Kumar Pithode, Collector of Bhopal, said, “I have not taken any such decision to declare the area (Raj Bhavan) as containment zone free area. I have got a proposal to the effect and am examining the same.”Manoharlal Dubey, secretary to the governor, said, “All I can say is as many as 11 families living in the zone have been shifted to some other place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-raj-bhawan-delisted-as-containment-zone-in-5-days-congress-protests/story-b6bNVyKyTSDTaq1bizMOrN.html

It will also touch Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Ludhiana in Punjab alongwith Kathua and Jammu in J&K.Dr Jitendra Singh, who is a Lok Sabha MP from Udhampur in Jammu division, has been pursuing this project since 2015 and about three and half years ago told the people in Katra that the proposal for the corridor has been accepted by Gadkari but it would take time to materialise because of procedural issues like survey, land acquisition, forest clearance etc.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAccording to Dr Jitendra Singh, the survey has been completed and the process of acquisition of land is nearly complete in Haryana and will now be taken up in Punjab followed by the Jammu and Kashmir segment of the corridor.The formal approval of the proposal has been obtained from Punjab. Jammu and Kashmir had approved it earlier.Singh said after the completion of the corridor, people would prefer to travel between Jammu and Delhi by road instead of train or by air. The corridor has been planned to connect the two holy cities of Katra and Amritsar along with some other important religious shrines between the two destinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/drive-from-delhi-to-katra-in-just-6-5-hours-by-2023-on-the-express-corridor-dr-jitendra-singh/story-cEPj9N5Et63XKIFyBQNWAP.html

The farmers are also being asked to take preventive measures like spraying neem seed kernel extract or neem-based insecticide on standing crops, he said.“The locust swarms have returned to Madhya Pradesh due to wind direction from Chhattisgarh after reaching Koria district of Chhattisgarh yesterday. However, there is a possibility of the swarm of locusts entering Odisha,” said the director.Chances of locust attack are high in Nabarangpur, Nuapada, Kalahandi, Malkangiri, Koraput, Rayagada, Jharsuguda, Sundargarh and Bargarh districts of the state. “The districts bordering Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand have been asked to stay on high alert. We are keeping a watch on the movement of locusts for next 10 days even as the insects are yet to reach Odisha. If required, Fire Service personnel will be engaged for spraying insecticide for locust control,” he said.The director said Standard Operating Procedures have been formulated at district-level and block-level for irrigation officials to monitor the situation and submit a report stating the density of the locusts area-wise. Based on this report, action to control them will be taken. Also, a district-level monitoring committee and a state-level control room will be set-up.Pawan Kumar Agarwal, the Vice-Chancellor of the Odisha University of Agriculture and Technology said the government will use drones to spray insecticides in remote or difficult areas to kill locusts. The arrival of the locust swarm mainly depends on monsoon and the direction of the wind. Control rooms have been set up at state and district levels for locust control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-alert-15-lakh-farmers-with-text-and-voice-messages-about-locusts/story-P8L0UNl9enRHfhzXyNqFuM.html
02-06-2020||India||Supreme Court mulls allowing physical hearings after lawyers complain||Nearly 95 per cent of the lawyers are not comfortable with virtual court hearings, the Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association (SCAORA) told Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde on Tuesday. The body of lawyers said that video hearings posed a major deterrent to present cases effectively. The SCAORA, body of lawyers eligible to file cases in the Supreme Court, urged the CJI to commence physical court hearings at the Supreme Court from July.“Most lawyers (almost 95%) are not comfortable with the virtual court hearings. The common feedback seems to be that the lawyers are unable to present their cases effectively in the virtual medium and the same is acting as a major deterrent for lawyers to consent for such virtual hearings,” the SCAORA said in a letter addressed to the CJI through its president, Shivaji M Jadhav.The court, after receiving such requests from various quarters, agreed to consider the feasibility of allowing physical appearance of advocates while adhering to social distancing norms. A notice to that effect was issued on Tuesday evening.All the advocates involved in a case should give their consent for physical hearing for a case to be listed in open court, the notice said.“Only on receipt of consent of all the parties to that effect, the matter will be considered for listing before the hon’ble court, subject to availability of the bench”, the notice issued by the court stated.The apex court started hearing cases through video conferencing on March 23, a day before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced the nationwide lockdown in view of the coronavirus pandemic.The top court also issued a circular on March 23, suspending entry of lawyers and litigants to the court premises. It said only extremely urgent cases will be taken up for hearing through video conferencing during the lockdown period.The hearing in the top court is conducted through ‘Vidyo app’, which can be downloaded on mobile phones and computers. The platform is hosted on the servers of the National Data Centre of National Informatics Centre. While the judges on the bench join the video conference from the residence of one of the judges, the lawyers join from their respective houses.“In matters involving several parties and appearances by many lawyers, not all lawyers are given a chance to speak and sometimes their mics are put on mute by the coordinator as a result of which their matters get heard in their absence. There are problems with audio and video quality of hearings, which results in the lawyers not being able to effectively put forth their arguments,” SCAORA said in its letter.The SCAORA, while acknowledging the work done by the court during the lockdown period, pointed out that many lawyers are not well equipped with knowledge of the use of computers and are, hence, unable to participate in the hearings effectively.“Many a time, when a Senior Advocate or arguing Counsel appears, he/she is left to appear on their own. The AOR/briefing lawyer is unable to assist them effectively in this virtual medium,” the letter added.The bar body also highlighted the difficulties faced by lawyers due to staggered working of courts for the past 3 months. The number of cases which are being heard by courts, including the Supreme Court, reduced drastically after video conference hearings were introduced.From March 23 to May 1, the Supreme Court heard 835 cases. On a normal working day when physical hearings used to happen, the court used to hear 800 cases in a single day.“Several lawyers have expressed their concern over to the Executive Committee of SCAORA over the loss of livelihood during the past few months. Unless the normal functioning of Courts is resumed, the said concern will not abate,” Jadhav said in the letter.The SCAORA, therefore, requested the CJI to go back to physical court hearings from July when the court reopens after the summer break. The court is expected to shut on June 19 and go on a summer break till the first week of July.“I, on behalf of SCAORA and thousands of lawyers, request the court to resume physical Court hearings upon re-opening in July 2020 after summer vacations. More so, in light of the announcement of the Unlock 1.0 and measures to be undertaken to resume normalcy in a phased manner,” Jadhav said.Justice DY Chandrachud, Supreme Court judge and chairperson of the e-committee of the court, had said on May 24 that virtual court hearings will not replace or be a substitute to physical courts“I want to dissuade people from the idea that virtual court hearings are some sort of a panacea. They will not be able to replace physical court hearings. We had to resort to virtual court hearings because Covid-19 descended without warning and we had no other choice. We had to protect those who come to court: lawyers, litigants, media personnel, para-legal, interns,” he said at a webinar organised by Nyaya Forum of National Academy of Legal Studies and Research, Hyderabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-mulls-allowing-physical-hearings-after-lawyers-complain/story-VdkMjiMFo20a3prTK9XTQI.html
02-06-2020||India||Covid-19: Bihar stops registration of migrants for quarantine||Patna: Bihar government on Tuesday announced that it would stop registration of migrant workers, who have returned to their home state amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions that were imposed on March 25 to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, to be lodged in quarantine centres.The new norms have come into effect from Monday evening. Now, migrants returning to Bihar are not required to undergo the mandatory 14-day stay at the quarantine centres set up by the state government to prevent the spread of the pandemic.Earlier, the state government had announced the closure of these quarantine centres from June 15, as the inmates would have completed their 14-day isolation period by then.The state disaster management department’s (DMD) data until Monday showed that 1,424,548 people were registered in 11,124 quarantine centres across the state. So far, the state government authorities have discharged 948,900 people and 475,648 are yet to complete their mandatory 14-day quarantine period at these centres. Around 28 lakh people have returned to Bihar either by road or via Shramik Special trains since the easing of lockdown restrictions.Pratyaya Amrit, principal secretary, DMD, explained the state government’s decision to close down these quarantine centres from June 15. “The last batch of migrants reached Bihar on Monday. Hence, the quarantine period for all the migrant returnees will end by June 15,” Amrit said.Be that as it may, on Tuesday, too, 24,750 people arrived in the state by 15 Shramik Special trains, while another six trains are expected to ferry around 9,900 on Wednesday.Amrit, however, doesn’t want to consider the recent returnees as migrants.“How do you know they’re migrants? Inter-state travel restrictions have been lifted, and people are free to arrive in Bihar by any mode of conveyance from any part of the country,” he said.He argued that the quarantine facility was introduced during lockdown restrictions or when they were partially eased.“There is no need for fresh registration for migrants, as restrictions on inter-state movement have been lifted across the country,” he added.Amrit, however, made it clear that door-to-door health monitoring would continue, as part of the state government’s bid to ramp up surveillance to prevent the spread of the viral outbreak.Most of the makeshift quarantine centres across the state are operating out of schools, which need to be vacated, as the authorities are looking at reopening them. An announcement is likely to be made in July regarding the reopening of schools after assessing the ground reality about the pandemic, the authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-bihar-stops-registration-of-migrants-for-quarantine/story-1Dv52KWGm3Ws1X2P5dlT7J.html

Nearly 20,000 people from 47 villages located close to the coastline in these districts are being evacuated to safer place, news agency PTI reported on Tuesday quoting state officials.Valsad collector RR Rawal told PTI that nearly 10,000 people from 35 coastal villages are being shifted. “We have already identified shelter homes and started the evacuation process,” he added.The Navsari administration also has begun the evacuation process.“As per the alert issued by India Meteorological Department, there is a possibility that Cyclone Nisarga may hit Navsari area tonight or by morning of June 4; all required measures have been taken,” Navsari district collector Ardra Agarwal told news agency ANI.Besides this, the National Disaster Response Force, NDRF, has deployed 16 teams in the state. NDRF director-general SN Pradhan said that most of the teams have been deployed in coastal areas.(With inputs from PTI and ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-braces-for-cyclone-nisarga-thousands-evacuated-from-coastal-areas/story-jajQk8qgb5YQC2qWXgdBXP.html
02-06-2020||India||MP minister’s praise for private hospitals’ role in Covid-19 fight upsets govt health professionals||Madhya Pradesh government’s applause for state’s private hospitals’ contribution in the fight against Covid-19 has not gone down well with the public health professionals, who claim, it has undermined their efforts, sacrifice and challenges.On Monday, health minister Narottam Mishra attended a function organised by Chirayu Medical College, Bhopal, to mark the recovery of about 1,000 Covid patients at the facility.Mishra showered praises on the medical college chairman Dr Ajay Goenka who he said had rendered “a yeoman service” to people of Bhopal and added, that “Chirayu hospital has become no. 1 in the country to send back a 1,000 patients home after successful treatment.”In the health bulletin released on Monday night, Mishra’s department suggested that the total number of patients discharged from hospitals in Bhopal till date stood at 963. As per health department officials, these 963 patients out of the total 1,515 registered in Bhopal, include 125 patients discharged from AIIMS, Bhopal, about 50 from Hamidia Hospital, 43 from Homoeopathy Medical College and two from a private hospital.Bhopal has registered the second highest number of deaths in the state- 59-- after Indore, which has witnessed 135 deaths as per the health department bulletin. Of the 59 deaths in the city, 38 were reported from Hamidia hospital, 11 from AIIMS, Bhopal and remaining from Chirayu. Ujjain has the third highest number of deaths at 58.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe function at Chirayu Hospital, Bhopal was followed by advertisement by Sri Aurobindo Institute of Medical Sciences, Indore on Tuesday, claiming to be only such hospital in the country that has discharged more than 1,600 Covid patients. Notably, the medical college also highlighted a Tweet post of health minister Narottam Mishra, which read, “Congratulations to Aurobindo Medical college for remarkable achievements in the field of plasma therapy. This has come as a new ray of hope for treatment of Covid-19.”Medical fraternity associated with the public health system reacted to the private medical colleges’ claims and the state government’s support to them with disappointment.“We expect of the government to highlight the achievements of the public health system too. The government doctors and other health department personnel have risked their lives during survey, screening, collection of samples, test and treatment,” said Dr Devendra Goswami, president of MP Medical Officers Association, Madhya Pradesh.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Dr Jyoti Bindal, dean of MGM Medical College, Indore said, “Since more patients were admitted to private medical colleges, the number of recoveries is on the higher side. We are also doing well and there is good recovery (rate) of patients in our medical college also.”Dr Pravin Jadia, ex-chief medical and health officer of Indore, agreed with Dr Bindal.“Both government and private facilities are giving same medical treatment as per WHO guidelines, but since government hospitals have limited number of beds in comparison to private medical colleges, the number of patients discharged from private facilities is on the higher side,” he said. A health department official, who didn’t want to be named, said, “The government must understand that going gaga over private medical colleges’ claims without knowing the number of serious patients and asymptomatic ones will adversely affect the morale of the government doctors and the para medical staff.”Public health expert Amulya Nidhi said, “It’s unfortunate that instead of focusing on strengthening the public health system and boosting the morale of its own doctors and para-medical staff, the government is sending out a message that public healthcare system is unable to control the situation and treat the patients.”Dr Parag Sharma, spokesperson for Gandhi Medical College, Bhopal said there was a reason for more Covid-19 deaths at Hamidia.“Hamidia and AIIMS, Bhopal have been receiving such patients who fall under severe acute respiratory syndrome, right from day one, when many hospitals didn’t accept patients with respiratory illness. But, still the death rate of such patients in Hamidia has been about 20% as against 25% to 30% at the global level,” Dr Sharma said.A health department official, who was not willing to be named, said, “Only health minister can comment on the government affairs.”The health minister did not respond to phone calls and text messages.However, state BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said, “Praising private facilities doesn’t mean criticising the public health system. From our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to every citizen in the country, all have appreciated the efforts by our doctors and para medical staff for doing their best.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-minister-s-praise-for-private-hospitals-role-in-coved-19-fight-upsets-govt-health-professionals/story-gmNQm28mQLLIeqQlqQFXYP.html

This was communicated to defence minister Rajnath Singh by his French counterpart Florence Parly during a phone call on Tuesday. “France reaffirmed its commitment to ensure timely delivery of Rafale aircraft despite the challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic,” the defence ministry said in a statement after the two ministers spoke.The IAF is likely to get the delivery of the first batch of four Rafale jets from France by July-end. The four fighters were supposed to fly to their home base in India in May 2020, but the plan was delayed due to the Covid-19 outbreak.Confinement measures announced by France to battle the outbreak had temporarily halted production at aircraft manufacturer Dassault Aviation’s Merignac facility.India ordered 36 Rafale jets from France in a deal worth Rs 59,000 crore in September 2016 as an emergency purchase to arrest the worrying slide in the air force’s combat capabilities.According to the delivery schedule, the first 18 jets (including the four in the first batch) are supposed to be delivered to the IAF by February 2021, with the rest expected by April-May 2022.France handed over to India its first Rafale fighter during a ceremony attended by Singh and Parly in Merignac on October 8, 2019, which coincided with the IAF’s 87th founding day and the Hindu festival of Dussehra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-says-will-deliver-rafale-on-time-despite-covid-19/story-LsSZpWc9vLD1KJsHiuSCaL.html

Sai, elected as Member of Parliament from Raigarh four times (1999-2014), served as Union minister in the first Narendra Modi’s government.

Sources within the party say that there was consensus around his name because of his influence among the tribals and his extensive track record in the state.Meanwhile, Chhattisgarh CM Bhupesh Baghel congratulated Sai for his appointment as the BJP state chief. छत्तीसगढ़ के मुख्य विपक्षी दल भारतीय जनता पार्टी के प्रदेश अध्यक्ष के रूप में चुने जाने पर मैं पूर्व केंद्रीय मंत्री एवं छत्तीसगढ़ भाजपा के नेता @vishnudsai जी को बधाई देता हूँ।आशा करता हूँ कि आपके नेतृत्व में छत्तीसगढ़ भाजपा सकारात्मक विपक्ष की भूमिका निभाए।“ ….. I hope that under your ( Sai’s ) leadership the BJP will play a role of positive opposition,” tweeted Baghel.On the other hand, leader of opposition in the state assembly, Dharmalal Kaushik and former CM Raman Singh also congratulated Sai and said that under his leadership the party will achieve a new identity and will become strong in Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vishnu-deo-sai-is-chhattisgarh-bjp-chief-cm-bhupesh-baghel-tweets-wishes/story-ppDHfHBRByJL76FAPDNkrO.html

The blowout at Baghjan occurred at 10.30 am on May 27, while work was underway to produce gas from a new oil and gas reservoir at a depth of 3,729 metres.“The operation to contain the blowout requires a large amount of water and lot of heavy machinery. Therefore, it will take several days to put everything in place before the actual effort to control the well can start,” OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika said.A water reservoir is being dug near the well to place two 2,500-gallon pumps and a pipeline is being laid from a nearby river to ensure continuous supply of water. OIL and Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) personnel are pumping water to the well to minimise the chances of a fire.“It has been assessed that approach to the vicinity of the well would not be safe due to gas gushing at high pressure. Hence, necessary equipment is being mobilised and fit-for-purpose equipment is being fabricated at OIL workshop,” OIL said in a statement on Tuesday.Help from several foreign firms is being sought to contain the blowout. OIL said on Tuesday experts from Singapore-based Alert Disaster Control could reach the site in the next few days.A retired senior OIL executive, who declined to be named, said: “The process to control a blowout requires lot of heavy equipment, which will have to be brought from other parts of the country, as well as services of global experts in dealing with such situations. In 2005, it took more than a month to bring things under control. This time could it could take longer.”Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal dialled Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan for the second time in a week on Tuesday and sought foreign experts to plug the natural gas flow at Baghjan well.Sonowal also sought adequate compensation for families affected by the blowout. His office said an expert team from Singapore would reach Assam on Wednesday to lend its expertise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blowout-in-assam-gas-well-may-take-a-few-weeks-before-it-s-under-control/story-5VTfE1F2IFmCdUqHgJnonM.html

The DMs will coordinate with them and provide them funds on the requirement basis”, said Mainali, a Nainital-based advocate.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Advocate Shiv Bhatt, counsel of Sachdanand Dabral had said on May 27 that the HC had sought a report on the condition of quarantine centres in four districts - Nainital, Udham Singh Nagar, Haridwar and Dehradun - with a high Covid-19 numbers after a PIL alleged they were in pathetic condition and lacked basic facilities.The court had directed secretaries of the District Legal Services Authorities of Nainital, Udham Singh Nagar, Haridwar and Dehradun to visit quarantine centers and submit a report to the court Mainali, petitioner in one of the PILs, said the District Legal Services Authorities of these four districts submitted their report to the HC, pointing out the pathetic condition and lack of basic facilities in quarantine centres in rural areas of these districts. The report highlighted poor conditions of sanitation, toilet facilities and food provided in the quarantine centres, he said.Mainali said the HC also directed the state government that it should address the findings of the report submitted by the District Legal Services Authorities and come up with suggestions. “For this, the secretary health department has been asked to submit a report within two weeks”, he said.On earlier directions of the HC regarding conducting rapid tests, Mainali said the state government apprised the court that 11,000 rapid test kits have been procured by it and so far 2,100 rapid tests have been conducted. “The HC directed the state government to submit state-wide details regarding rapid test kits distributed and tests conducted across the state within two weeks”, he said.On May 20, the HC had directed the state government to procure rapid test kits immediately and start testing on an experimental basis at the border points. It had said “although rapid antibody test has not been approved by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which is the nodal agency spearheading the fight against Cocid-19 pandemic in the country) for diagnostic purposes, but since the result of this test is available in much less time, such tests can be used for surveillance purposes alone. At least it would be a better surveillance than the surveillance by thermal screening!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-tells-uttarakhand-to-provide-funds-village-heads-to-manage-quarantine-centres/story-p1xsWo3aypHGTRmpLgBc9O.html

02-06-2020||India||198 migrant workers killed in road accidents during lockdown: Report||One hundred and ninety eight migrant workers lost their lives in road accidents during the lockdown period, according to data compiled by the SaveLIFE Foundation, a road safety NGO.There were at least 1,461 accidents over the course of the nationwide lockdown - from March 25 to May 31 - in which at least 750 people were killed, including 198 migrant workers. There were 1,390 who got injured, according to the data. Migrant workers, killed during their efforts to go back home, comprise 26.4% of the overall deaths during the lockdown whereas essential workers comprise 5.3% of the total deaths. The overall deaths involving other other road users stands at 68.3 percent.The report contributes fatigue among bus and truck drivers, hired to transport migrants, combined with over speeding and poor engineering of roads as the top reason for deaths. Out of the reported deaths, Uttar Pradesh accounted for over 30% (245) of the total deaths followed by Telangana (56), Madhya Pradesh (56), Bihar (43), Punjab (38) and Maharashtra (36).The top five states that reported road crash deaths of migrant workers are Uttar Pradesh (94), Madhya Pradesh (38), Bihar (16), Telangana (11) and Maharashtra (9).To be clear, the report says that the data has been compiled using media-tracking and multi-source verification.Further analysis reveals that around 27% of the victims were migrant workers whereas 5% were essential workers like police, doctors, and others. About 68% of the overall deaths involved pedestrians, two-wheelers and three-wheelers – categorised as Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs).“Since the lockdown began, nearly 200 migrant workers have lost their lives while walking, cycling back home, traveling in HMVs and LMV commercial vehicles, and in mass fatality crashes involving state-organised buses. One of the recurring reasons for mass casualties in most of the incidents was speeding and driver fatigue due to continuous driving on tenuous routes,” the report said.Out of the four phases of lockdown, phase four was the deadliest overall in terms of road deaths with 322 deaths (43%) and phase three was the deadliest in particular for migrant workers. Phase three reported 60% of all migrant deaths in road crashes during lockdown followed by phase four with 19% of total migrant deaths reported in the media. “With Covid-19 still very much around, we simply can’t afford to burden our already overburdened healthcare system with road crash related trauma. The data collated by us suggests that there has been a surge in road crashes with lifting of the restrictions across the states in Phase 3 and Phase 4. It is critical that states enhance enforcement to prevent road crashes and the citizens inculcate essential safety habits for the road like they did for personal hygiene during the lockdown,” said Piyush Tewari, Founder and CEO, SaveLIFE Foundation.According to the report, vehicle-on-vehicle collisions constituted the highest crash configuration with 43% of all road crash deaths. In 15% cases, speeding was highlighted as a factor, though it is likely that speeding was involved in most fatal crashes though not highlighted in the media reports tracked, it said. Pedestrian rundowns constituted 9% of the total death toll.The union home minister had issued several communications to states to ensure that migrant workers do not have to walk back to their home states. On May 15, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote to states instructing them to urge migrants to take the Shramik Special trains, which are currently in operation.“In case they are found in such conditions, they should be taken to nearby shelters, appropriately counseled and provided food and water till such time they are facilitated to board the Shramik Special trains or buses to their native places,” Bhalla had said, adding that incidents of migrants walking back to their homes were still being reported from across the country.So far, more than 56 lakh migrants have been sent back home in Shramik Special trains, according to the ministry of railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/198-migrant-workers-killed-in-road-accidents-during-lockdown-report/story-hTWzAWMYn0kyycKw1dyKqL.html

Besides, 5.30 lakh migrants, till date, are living at block and district level quarantine centres across the state.“Migrant labourers are going to their homes after completing the 14-day institutional quarantine. Since there are chances of unwanted pregnancies, so we properly counsel them (migrant labourers) and give them tools (such as condoms) to avoid unwanted pregnancy,” a senior Health department official told PTI.The official, who is entrusted with Family Planning in State Health Society, however, made it clear that “it is purely a family planning measure and has nothing to do with COVID-19. “As a health professional, it is our responsibility to control the population. We have been taking the support of our health partner Care India to implement the initiative,” he said.

The fatal second bite occurred when she was undergoing treatment for the first bite by a viper at her husband’s home two months ago. Later, police did a post-mortem on the carcass of the black cobra that had bit the deceased to collect scientific evidences.After her death, Uthra’s parents alleged that it was a well-planned murder and her in-laws and sister (in- law) were aware of the crime. During questioning, Sooraj reportedly told the police that his parents also knew about the plot and they hid her ornaments. The police then recovered 37 sovereigns of gold on Monday which was buried in two packets. Uthra’s parents alleged that a major portion of the gold gifted as dowry was missing.Crime branch deputy superintendent A Ashokan said all three, Sooraj’s parents and sister, will be booked for domestic violence, anti-dowry provisions, abetment to crime and destroying evidences. Earlier, the state women’s commission had also directed the police to book them. The case surfaced after Uthra’s parents filed a complaint a week after her death. They alleged that Sooraj and his family members often harassed her for dowry. The couple had got married two years ago and has a one-year-old son. Her father said that he had gifted over 100 sovereigns of gold, a new car and Rs 10 lakh cash to appease her ever- demanding in-laws.Later, probe revealed that Sooraj had bought a cobra from a snake handler for Rs 10,000. On May 6, he reportedly took the snake to Uthra’s paternal house in Anchal, where she was undergoing treatment for the first snake bite. The police said after Uthra fell asleep, Sooraj allegedly took out the snake from the bottle and threw it on her. Later, he also said Uthra was sedated by lacing sleeping pills in her food.Also Read: Kerala woman’s death after second snake bite turns out to be a murderHe told pgolice he kept awake all night to ensure that he could escape unscathed. He left the room in the morning and started reading a newspaper in the verandah as if nothing happened. Soon, Uthra’s mother found her daughter lying unconscious in the bed. She was rushed to a hospital, where doctors said she died of a snake bite. Later, the cobra was found from Uthra’s room and killed.Expert snake handler Vava Suresh, who has rescued more than 500 king cobras and many other snakes, said the accused might have taken training in snake handling and might have inflicted pain on the reptile to provoke it to bite. The post-mortem revealed that Uthra was bitten twice by the cobra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-snake-bite-murder-three-more-arrested-hidden-gold-ornaments-dug-out/story-STR75oMUJfRKuR6JNPu50I.html

Lack of support to the poor and the MSME sector means the worst is yet to come,” he tweeted.Downgrading India’s rating by a notch to ‘Baa3’ from ‘Baa2’ assigned in November 2018, Moody’s on Monday estimated India’s GDP would shrink by 4% -- the first full fiscal contraction in more than four decades.Addressing a virtual news conference, Punjab Congress chief Sunil Jakhar questioned the Central government’s intention of helping farmers, saying Modi’s aim of doubling their income by 2022 will remain a “pipe dream” if they don’t get the promised minimum support price (MSP) for their produce.He said a majority of farm produce is purchased in the open market at rates much lower than the MSP declared by the government.“The government’s intention is doubtful. If it wants to help farmers, give them the due price for their produce,” he said.Jakhar urged the prime minister to make MSP a “legally binding right” of farmers to ensure they get right and remunerative prices for their produce.The government on Monday raised MSP of paddy by a marginal Rs 53 a quintal to Rs 1,868 a quintal for 2020-21, while the rates for oilseeds, pulses and cereals were hiked substantially.Jakhar charged the government with “betraying” farmers for not coming out with the CACP (Commission for Agricultural Costs and Prices) report on fixing MSPs of different crops.Except for wheat and paddy, a majority of crops is sold at prices much below MSP as agencies do not buy them at government rates, he said.“The farmers lose out in the bargain. The prime minister wants to revive the economy, but what has the farmer got in his Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package?” asked the Punjab Congress chief.Instead of giving any cash benefits to farmers, he said the Centre advised them to take more credit. “Farmers are already reeling under debt and are committing suicides,” Jakhar said, urging the prime minister to grant fiscal incentives to farmers and waive off their loans.Jakhar said the exodus of migrant workers to their home states will further impact the country’s Coronavirus-hit economy.The input cost of farmers has risen during the pandemic, as labour is not easily available because migrant workers have left for their homes, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/moody-s-rated-modi-s-handling-of-economy-a-step-above-junk-rahul-gandhi/story-L8ogdYm4CaY6GOEDB3Uu1M.html

02-06-2020||India||Adesh Kumar Gupta replaces Manoj Tiwari as Delhi BJP chief||New Delhi: Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief JP Nadda on Tuesday appointed Adesh Kumar Gupta, a councillor from West Patel Nagar, as the new chief of its Delhi unit over three months after the saffron party got a drubbing from the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) in the assembly elections.Gupta will replace Bhojpuri actor-turned-politician and a Member of Parliament (MP) from north-east Delhi, Manoj Tiwari, who held the post for three-and-a-half years.Gupta (51), who started his political career with the Akhil Bharatiya Vidyarthi Parishad, has risen through the ranks in the party and was elected the mayor of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation in 2018. He held various posts in the BJP’s Delhi unit, including the office secretary in 2012.Political analysts are of the opinion that Gupta’s appointment is a part of the BJP strategy to woo baniyas, or traders, and Punjabis, its core support base, in the national capital.The BJP appointed Tiwari, who had joined the party just before the 2014 Lok Sabha elections, as its Delhi unit chief in December 2016 in a bid to woo the Purvanchal community, those who hail from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar and a significant vote bank in state politics.His elevation was also predicated to Delhi elections that were held in February, where the BJP performed disastrously and managed to win only eight of the 70 seats. Initially, Tiwari’s ascent in Delhi BJP had benefitted the party, as it not only won the municipal elections in 2017 for the third consecutive term, despite huge anti-incumbency, but also bettered its score in several seats.The party had projected Tiwari as its Purvanchali face to galvanise the support of the community. The BJP won all seven seats in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections under Tiwari’s leadership. But the humiliating defeat in Delhi polls put paid to his rising career graph. “This is a routine appointment, which was due for long. The appointment couldn’t be done earlier due to elections in Delhi, followed by riots and then the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak,” said a senior BJP leader.“The decision to appoint a baniya shows that the party wants to keep its core support base intact. Besides, the next elections in Delhi are of the civic bodies that are still two years away. Gupta will be able to win civic polls for the party,” he added.This is not the first time that the BJP has appointed a councillor as its Delhi chief.

The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Agarwal also said that India’s recovery and fatality rates are much better than the world average. “The fatality rate in our country is 2.82%, one of the lowest—compared to the world average of 6.13%,” he said, before adding that even the figure of case fatality per lakh population in India is 0.41 compared to the world average of 4.9.Pushing the argument that India had shown better disease management, agarwal said that India’s fatalities were concentrated among patients of a particular age group and with pre-existing health conditions. Covid-19 outbreaks may be seasonal, scientists sayOne in every two Coved-19 deaths in India has been from the senior citizen population, who constitute 10% of our total population. 73% of India’s Covid-19 fatalities are cases of co-morbiities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and respiratory diseases,” he said.He listed several focus areas in the containment effort which were behind this relative success.“Early case identification, clinical management, surveillance, contact tracing; these efforts has helped us improve our fatality rate to 2.82%,” said Lav Agarwal. India’s Covid-19 tally was just a little over 37,000 a month ago and has jumped more than five times. The number of deaths has also climbed—1,218 people were reported dead on May 2. According to the latest data, 95,526 people have been cured which translates into 48.07% recovery rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-says-india-s-ranking-as-7th-worst-affected-nation-misleading-it-s-faring-better-than-the-rest/story-gS9j3LThTMr4uQwQcKxX9I.html

02-06-2020||India||Rajasthan explores feasibility of creating manufacturing hubs along highways||The Rajasthan government is exploring the possibility of establishing manufacturing hubs along highways in the state to bring in investment and create jobs, a senior official of the industry department has said.Under the proposal, the state is looking at designating areas along highways as manufacturing hubs. These projects would be on the lines of the Delhi-Mumbai Industrial Corridor and Bharatmala, which focus on developing economic corridors, the official said on condition of anonymity.The state government has asked the task force of the industry department to study the possibility of declaring land on both the sides of state and national highways as manufacturing zones and easing the process of conversion of land, the official said.Referring to the benefits of such hubs, the official said: “Along the highways, there are generally no residential areas. The transportation cost of raw materials will be low, and warehouses will be close as they usually are located along highways.”As a pilot, the state has started some projects, such as the upcoming oil refinery in Barmer, and a petroleum chemicals and petrochemicals investment region (PCPIR) being developed along the Jodhpur-Barmer highway. A detailed project report has also been prepared.The official said two locations had been identified by the Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment Corporation (RIICO) for PCRIP –Borawas Kalawa (where land has been acquired to develop an industrial area) and Ram Nagar Thob (where land has been identified).“Two major express highways – Delhi-Vadodara and Jamnagar Amritsar – cross Rajasthan. Now, industrial development is mostly near highways and railways. The state is looking for land banks close to highways as it is all about connectivity,” the official said.Besides PCPIR, the state has developed and sold clusters for sports goods and toys at Khuskheda in Bhiwadi, which will benefit domestic business.Similarly, gas grids are being established in Rajasthan so that raw materials going from the state to Gujarat for making ceramic goods, in the absence of a gas grid, will be utilised here. The state has identified two locations for gas grids and six firms have shown interest.CII Rajasthan chairman Vishal Baid said the National Highways Authority of India accomplished the figure for the highest ever highway construction of 3,979 km in fiscal 2020.“We should take advantage of this widespread facility and establish industrial manufacturing hubs alongside these national highways, which will provide easy access to transport raw material and finished goods to various places, with minimum traffic congestion. It will save fuel and lead time and also decrease pollution levels in cities due to the movement of heavy vehicles,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-explores-feasibility-of-creating-manufacturing-hubs-along-highways/story-rwchTTSi8m0OP2WxU4t2CL.html

02-06-2020||India||Jessica Lal’s murderer Manu Sharma walks out of Tihar jail||Manu Sharma, who was serving a life term after being convicted of the murder of model Jessica Lal in 1999, was released from Tihar jail on Monday evening after lieutenant governor (LG) Anil Baijal accepted the recommendations of the Sentence Review Board (SRB). “The lieutenant governor had accepted the recommendations of the SRB meeting held on May 11,” Sharma’s lawyer Amit Sahni said.Any convict -- barring one found guilty of heinous crimes such as rape and murder, murder and robbery, murder in cases of terrorism and murder while out on parole -- who has completed 14 years in prison without remission is eligible for early release.Watch | Manu Sharma, who killed Jessica Lal in 1999, released from Delhi’s Tihar jail The prison’s director general Sandeep Goel confirmed Sharma was released on Monday. Siddharth Vashishta, 43, better known by his alias Manu Sharma, shot dead model Jessica Lal, who was tending an unlicensed bar at a private party on April 30, 1999, after she refused to serve him a drink well past midnight. He is the son of Haryana politician Venod Sharma.In November 2019, Sahni approached the Delhi high court seeking Sharma’s release. In his plea, he said that despite spending 23 years in jail (with remission added), and a record of good conduct in prison, the SRB denied his client’s release on four separate occasions in an “unfair and unlawful manner.”Remission is when a prisoner displays good conduct in prison, and his/her sentence is reduced. While Sharma has served around 16 years of actual sentencing, he has completed 23 years with remission.The Delhi high court had then asked the board to consider Sharma’s case for release in its next meeting, which took place on May 11. The board consists of the state home minister, who is its chairman, and the prison’s director-general, state home secretary, state law secretary, a district judge, the government’s chief probationary officer and a joint commissioner-rank officer of the Delhi Police.Last month Lal’s sister Sabrina had said that she had forgiven Sharma and that he had served his time for the crime. Sabrina had also said that it was time for her to move on. “ My fight was always for justice. We got justice. If he is released. I have no problem.” Sharma’s acquittal by a city court in February 2006 triggered protests across the country, after which the Delhi high court took up the case. The high court reversed the order, saying the lower court ignored or misread material evidence. Sharma was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment in December 2006. The Supreme Court upheld the order in 2010.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jessica-lal-s-murderer-manu-sharma-walks-out-of-tihar-jail/story-vqmiGQ58U8jZzaJte1Q68H.html

The lifting of a ban on inter-state movement on May 4 is believed to be the prime factor for the jump in cases.The first case in the region was detected on March 24, when a 23-year-old woman who returned from the UK tested positive in Manipur. On May 5, the figure for the entire region was just 103 cases. The total population of the region is more than 45 million.On May 5, Assam had 44 positive cases, one death, 32 recoveries and 11 people under treatment. Four weeks later, on June 1, the state’s tally stood at 1,486 cases, four deaths, 285 recoveries and 1,194 people under treatment. The total cases included 1,337 people who had returned to state since May 4.“The surge in positive cases is because of the homecoming of our residents from other states. Nearly 800 of the new cases are those of people who returned from Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Delhi,” Assam’s health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Sunday.Tripura recorded its biggest one-day spike on Monday, when 107 people tested positive, taking the state’s tally to 421 cases. Of the total, 166 were Border Security Force (BSF) personnel from two battalions based in the state and their family members. On May 5, the state had just 42 cases.On Tuesday morning, Mizoram chief minister Zoramthanga Tweeted about 12 new cases in the state, including 10 people who had returned from Delhi and two from Kolkata.The state had recorded just one case prior to this, of a 50-year-old pastor who was found positive on March 24 and recovered by May 9.Nagaland recorded six new cases on Tuesday morning, taking the state’s total to 49. The state’s first Covid-19 cases were detected on May 25, when three people who returned on a Shramik Special train from Chennai tested positive.Meghalaya had 13 Covid-19 cases till May 5, all of them connected to a family in the state capital Shillong in the East Khasi Hills. Two weeks later, a person who returned from Chennai tested positive in the Garo Hills, the first Covid-19 patient in the region. The state’s tally now stands at 28.With both its first two positive cases recovering, Manipur didn’t have an active Covid-19 case as of May 5. But the status changed 10 days later, with the detection of an infection. The state now has 83 cases with 11 recoveries and no deaths.Arunachal Pradesh was Covid-19 free as of May 5, with the lone patient in the state recovering the previous month. But with the return of the state’s residents from other parts of the country, the figures started increasing. On Monday, the state recorded 16 new cases, taking its tally to 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-just-assam-other-ne-states-witness-spike-in-covid-19-cases-as-people-return-to-region/story-ZRrmFswaKhrLBsbeGAgalJ.html

Muneer Raqib, Jammu and Kashmir’s secretary for art, culture and language, said the local academy for art, culture and languages started the trend and he hoped this would be replicated across the country. “We have organised six full-fledged mushairas, sessions for songs, skits and magic shows, and plan to have similar activities in the near future,” he said.The academy started with online sessions of songs in different languages, and poets then requested that online mushairas be arranged. This was done along with several cultural organisations of Kashmir, he said.“From the past one year, the academy had plans to switch over to online and virtual sessions to reach a larger audience, especially among youngsters. The Covid-19 gave us an opportunity. We have asked people to use our facilities or help to reach their target audience,” Raqib said.Two days ago, one of the oldest cultural organisations in Jammu and Kashmir, the Rafiabad Adbi Markaz, joined hands with the Academy of Art, Culture and Languages for a long online poetic symposium that was joined by more than 17 poets.Mohammad Ashraf Tak, chief editor of the academy, said local literary organisations played a key role in making the online platform a great success at a time when such activities have been curtailed by the Covid-19 crisis. “This is just the beginning and more programmes and projects are in the offing,” he said.The verses and compositions of some of the poets and writers were inspired by the Coronavirus and its deadly impact on day-to-day activities. “These online sessions have attracted good audiences and people have liked this very much. For us, it is lockdown literature. We have done two so far and it’s just the beginning,” said Rafiq Masoodi, who served as secretary of the academy for several years.Many poets are now regularly uploading their latest poems in English, Urdu, Hindi and Kashmiri on social media and some have written long verses on the pandemic as they try to give the people hope that it won’t last long.However, Tajamul, one of the participants in an online mushaira, said: “It’s not easy to conduct a mushaira on 2G connection, and despite the slow internet speed, we completed it. For us, this mushaira was an act of resilience.”Authorities snapped internet connectivity across Kashmir after the erstwhile state’s special status was scrapped last August. Recently, 2G connectivity was restored in the region but there have been numerous complaints about the slow speeds.Athar Bashir, a young poet well versed with social media, said the Covid-19 lockdown has given a fillip to poets to write about recent happenings.“Through social media, we can share our literary creations to a cross-section of society and it’s encouraging when they reach a large audience, especially among the younger generation who are hooked to social media. Also, it helps us to maintain social distancing and poets are not at risk of being infected by the Coronavirus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashmir-s-poets-take-mushairas-online-amid-covid-19-lockdown/story-tt88y8tJUGPCvw0T9JK3kK.html

Prime Minister Modi announced a special relief package of Rs 1,000 crore for Bengal and Rs 500 crore for Odisha after conducting an aerial survey of affected areas in both states. Now that another approaches, he has extended his prayers for the well being of people in the region that may come in the path of the cyclone that first turned into a deep depression into the Arabian Sea and then into a storm before it was assessed to gather enough power to turn into a severe cyclonic storm in the next 24 hours.Also Read: Cyclone Nisarga: Landfall expected over Raigad district on Wednesday afternoon“Praying for everyone’s well-being.

But what matters is that people understand the message. Many people have uninstalled Chinese apps. So when crores uninstall apps. It will be a message for the Chinese government when they are intruding into India,” Wangchuk said.He insisted the people’s “wallet power” could be an ideal supplement for the army’s capabilities to safeguard our borders in Ladakh. “It is not only the army which will give a fitting reply to the Chinese but the people are also with the army and they will respond with their wallets,” he said.Wangchuk said that boycott is a powerful weapon that could make China realise that antagonizing India could prove to be a costly affair.“When traders will start cancelling orders from China it will send a powerful message to Chinese government that antagonising India will extract a huge price. The government will be apprehensive that the Chinese population may turn against it because trade is the only support for the people of that country who otherwise are like bonded labour. So if their income from trade is disturbed there could be a possibility of a revolt. It is imperative to ensure that the boycott of Chinese products is successful. I hope the conduct of Indians can become an example for the rest of the world to follow,” said the engineer-turned-education reformer who inspired Aamir Khan’s character in the Bollywood blockbuster 3 Idiots.India’s trade deficit with China is massive at $56.77 billion. The bilateral trade between India and China was $93 billion last year after it fell by about $3 billion as both countries experienced economic slowdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/boycott-will-make-china-pay-heavily-for-provoking-india-sonam-wangchuk/story-nKgktimhHmq6m8H4C5XU6M.html

Cyclone Amphan was the last name in the previous list and was supposed to take up for the first cyclonic storm to occur in the region this year. Amphan was suggested by Thailand in the year 2004 while Nisarga was a suggestion that came from Bangladesh. The last cyclone in the region before Amphan, Fani, was also named by Bangladesh.  After Nisarga, the names to be used will be taken from the new list, starting with Gati (named by India), Nivar (Iran), and so forth.

02-06-2020||India||Cyclone Nisarga: How was the cyclonic storm set to hit Maharashtra, Gujarat named||The deep depression in the Arabian Sea intensified into a cyclonic storm, which has been officially named as Cyclone Nisarga by the India Meteorological Department (IMD), around 12pm on Tuesday, officials said.Cyclone Nisarga, headed towards the coastline of Maharashtra and Gujarat, comes a week after Cyclone Amphan wreaked havoc in West Bengal. Nisarga, which is currently brewing in the Arabian Sea, means nature and was named by Bangladesh. The name was accorded in a list formulated by a group of countries.Bangladesh had also suggested ‘Fani’, which had made a landfall in Odisha on May 3, 2019, and the extremely severe cyclone had caused extensive damage in the eastern state.Tropical cyclones are named to help the scientific community and disaster managers to identify cyclones, create awareness and effectively disseminate warnings to wider audiences.The naming of cyclones in the Indian Ocean began in 2000 and a formula was agreed in 2004.The World Meteorological Organisation and the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific had, at its 27th session held in 2000, agreed to assign names to the tropical cyclones in the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea.Bangladesh, India, Maldives, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Thailand were part of the panel. Later in 2018 Iran, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Yemen were added to the list.Cyclones around the world are named by Regional Specialised Meteorological Centres and Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres. There are a total of six RSMCs and five TCWCs, including the India Meteorological Department.The Indian weather bureau has been mandated with the duty to name cyclones that develop over the North Indian ocean, including Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, by following a standard procedure.IMD released a list of cyclone names in April 2020 as suggested by the 13 countries. The names like Arnab, Nisarga, Aag, Vyom, Azar, Prabhanjan, Tej, Gati, Lulu among 160 other names were listed.The next few cyclones will be named Gati (named by India), Nivar (Iran), Burevi (Maldives), Tauktae (Myanmar) and Yaas (Oman).The new list included the last name from the previous list ‘Amphan’ as it remained unused at the time of release. After ‘Amphan’, ‘Nisarga’ name was picked up for the ensuing cyclone.IMD has said the names should be gender, politics, religion and culture neutral, not hurt sentiments, not be offensive, be short, easy to pronounce.Cyclone Nisarga is expected to make landfall very close to Alibag, 94km south of Mumbai, on the afternoon of June 3.“The landfall location will be very close to Alibag but extensive damage can be expected in Mumbai also,” Sunita Devi, in-charge of cyclones at IMD, said.Cyclone Nisarga is likely to cross north Maharashtra and adjoining south Gujarat coast between Harihareshwar (Maharashtra) and Daman during the afternoon of June 3.The storm surge is expected to be one to two metres above the astronomical tide and is very likely to inundate low-lying areas of Mumbai, Thane and Raigad districts at the time of landfall. It is also expected to be about 0.5 to one metre above the astronomical tide and likely to inundate low-lying areas of Ratnagiri district.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyclone-nisarga-how-was-the-cyclonic-storm-set-to-hit-maharashtra-gujarat-named/story-yft0m40tmspjXc0qEHcSGN.html

Besides, 5.30 lakh migrants are still lodged in block and district level quarantine centres  “We have stopped the registration of migrants from Monday for putting them in 14-day institutional quarantine...Why will anyone (migrant) be registered and for what when restrictions on the movement of people have been lifted in the country. How do you know who is migrant because now anyone can come either by train, bus, car or any other mode?” Disaster Management Departments Principal Secretary Pratyaya Amrit told PTI.He said quarantine facilities were introduced when movement of people was either banned or restricted.During the lockdown, people had to obtain passes from the competent authorities to undertake travel from one place to another. But with the introduction of unlock 1, such requirement has been done away with, he said.He, however, asserted that door-to-door health monitoring will continue.The officer said quarantine centres will be closed after June 15 when the 14-day quarantine period of the last batch of registered migrants will end.“Why quarantine centres will remain open when there will be no one at these centres after the arrival of last batch which was supposed to reach Bihar by June 1? “We had written a letter to the official concerned to send the special (Shramik) train by June 1. If we take that into account, the quarantine period will come to an end on June 15,” he said.Schools also have to be vacated for starting academic activities, he said.So far, 28 to 29 lakh migrants have reached Bihar in its biggest ever evacuation exercise, he claimed.The state governments decision comes at a time when many migrants returning to Bihar have tested positive for Covid-19, leading to a massive surge in the number of cases.According to the data released by the state Health department, the number of migrants who have tested positive since May 3 is 2,743. Bihar had reported 3,872 cases and 23 deaths till Monday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-government-closes-migrants-registration-for-quarantine/story-yFq10wOTr9ted7ooubN17K.html
02-06-2020||India||‘Not random, aimed at self-reliant India’: PM Modi on policy announcements||The government’s policy announcements are not “random”, underscored Prime Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, adding that they will help create a self-reliant India that aims to cater to the world’s economy. The PM also put his faith in the country’s entrepreneurship for “definitely” getting the growth back.Addressing a conference on ‘Getting Growth Back’ organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) at its 125th anniversary, he said he would go beyond the theme to say, “Yes ! We will definitely get our growth back.”“Some of you may think in this time of crisis how could I say this with such confidence? There are many reasons for this confidence. I’ve confidence in India’s capabilities and crisis management. I’ve confidence in India’s talent and technology. I’ve confidence in India’s innovation and intellect. I’ve confidence in India’s farmers, MSMEs and entrepreneurs,” he said in Hindi through a virtual address.The Covid-19 pandemic has battered the global economy and India is not an exception. According to official data released on Friday, the Indian economy grew by 3.1% in the first three months this year and 4.2% in the financial year 2019-20. Prolonged nationwide lockdown is expected to dent the economy further in this financial year.The PM said Covid-19 has slowed India’s growth, but the biggest truth is that India has left behind the lockdown and has entered into the “un-lock phase one” and a major part of the economy has restarted.“Today we are able to do this because when Coronavirus was spreading globally, India took the right steps at the right time. When we compare ourselves with other countries, we come to know about the effectiveness of the lockdown in India,” he said.One of the “highest priorities” of the government, the PM added, is to strengthen the economy again. “For this, the government is taking decisions required to be taken immediately. And simultaneously, such decisions have also been taken that would help the country in the long run,” he said.Modi was referring to the Rs 20.97 lakh crore economic stimulus package announced between March 26 and May 17 that included free foodgrains and direct cash benefits to the poor, credit guarantee schemes for the industry, monetary measures by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and wide-ranging policy reforms.“The Prime Minister Garib Kalyan Yojana (PMGKY) helped in giving immediate relief to the poor. Under this scheme, ration has been provided to 74 crore beneficiaries. Free ration is also being supplied to the migrant labourers,” he said. The package helped the poor and 80 million of them got a free cooking gas cylinder under the scheme, he added. The PMGKY was the first response to Covid-19 that was announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on March 26.The entire package is a combination of providing relief to the underprivileged section of the society and restoration of the economy along with policy reforms, Modi said.“For us reform is not a random or scattered decision. For us, reform is a systematic, planned, integrated, inter-connected and futuristic process. For us, reform means dare to take decisions and take them to the logical conclusion,” he said.On the things necessary to take India on a higher growth trajectory, the PM spotlighted five things: intent, inclusion, investment, infrastructure and innovation. “You can get a glimpse of them also in the bold decisions taken recently,” he said.The PM was referring to the recent decision of giving full freedom to the farmer to sell produce without involving the middleman. He said that labour laws are being reformed to create more job opportunities and private sector participation has been allowed in strategic sectors such as space and nuclear energy.The path of growth is self-reliance and the world has great expectations from India, said Modi. “India has potential, strength and ability. “All of you should, India’s industry should take full advantage of the trust the world has for India,” he said.“Getting growth back is not that difficult. And, above all, Indian industries have a clear path, which is the path of Atmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India),” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-random-aimed-at-self-reliant-india-pm-modi-on-policy-announcements/story-PiWDx3QCLA4BLfWci4hK5N.html

Later, the coal would be shifted to surface. The blast is learnt to have occurred while fixing detonators in the holes,” a police official from Ramagundam said.Peddapalli MP Venkatesh Netha, Ramagundam MLA Korukanti Chander, Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) general secretary Janak Prasad and Bharatiya Janata Party Ramagundam district unit president Somarapu Satyanarayana called on the injured in the hospital.Leaders of the Indian National Trade Union Congress (INTUC) demanded that the Singareni management should pay ex gratia of Rs 1 crore to each of the families of the deceased.“We also demand that all the three injured be paid a compensation of Rs 50 lakh each.

Video footage showed the officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he gasped for breath, sparking widespread protests across the US. “Floyd’s killing by police and the ‘Black lives matter’ agitation in the US have given a clear message to the world that a common man’s life has value and it should not be taken for granted,” Mayawati said in a tweet in Hindi.“India’s constitution guarantees independence, security, self-respect and pride and governments should give special attention to it. If it was followed, crores of migrant labourers would not have to witness such bad days,” she added.She also demanded better coordination between states to check the spread of coronavirus and said the Centre should intervene.“While coronavirus patients are rising, there is lack of coordination between states and with the Centre, and allegation and counter allegations are going on and sealing of state borders is unjustified and it is weakening the fight against the virus.

In the last two months 21,84,291, or 55% of the total job cards were issued because of the pandemic,” said Mazhar Khan, nodal officer, MGNREGS, Chhattisgarh.The percentage of job cards is calculated as per a financial year – from April 1 to March 31 – and in 2019 around 63% were issued by the state government.“We’re expecting that MGNREGS will generate up to 80% of rural employment in this financial year because of the pandemic,” Khan added.The state government authorities said the intake under MGNREGS has doubled in Chhattisgarh that has an estimated population of about 29 million. Data showed that the total number of registered rural households in Chhattisgarh is 41,22,882, of which 39,55,163, or about 96% have job cards. A registered household refers to a person from a family living in rural areas, who have applied to avail of the benefits under the MGNREGS and his application has been accepted by the secretary of a panchayat.The state government is yet to issue 167,779 job cards to MGNREGS aspirants.Dharmlal Kaushik, leader of opposition in Chhattisgarh assembly, has demanded that the state government must increase the mandatory workdays from 100 to 150 under the scheme, as several labourers have exhausted their 100-day quota and are facing joblessness because of the Covid-19-induced economic crisis.“Our data showed that 2,227 households have completed their 100 days of work,” Khan said.State panchayat minister Tribhuvaneshwar Saran Singh Deo has countered Kaushik’s suggestions. “I’ve already written to the Centre government, stating that the state government is willing to ensure an additional 50 days of works for those enrolled under the MGNREGS. However, we’d like to impress upon the Centre that it must mandatorily double the assured workdays from 100 to 200 because of the deepening economic crisis.”The minister did a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation to arrive at the proposed increase in the number of the workdays under the scheme. “Usually, a calendar year has 365 days, of which 52 are either Sundays or a weekly off. At least three months account for monsoon, or another 100-odd days are lost. The rest of the days can be easily utilised for MGNREGS,” he said.Singh Deo urged the Centre to mandate more workdays under the scheme and also ensure prompt payment facilities. In normal circumstances, a labourer in Chhattisgarh clock around 36 workdays, even though the cap is on 100 days. “Now, this option should be doubled to 200 workdays to tide over the growing unemployment woes in rural areas,” he added.Singh Deo has instructed officials to create new job cards for migrant workers under MGNREGS, farm and allied sectors, water conservation and irrigation on a priority basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-sees-record-intake-of-labourers-under-mgnregs-in-last-two-months/story-VRUcwRco71t3JrPbIFQX3J.html

Citing lack of support to the poor and MSME sector, Gandhi has also issued a warning, saying that the worst is yet to come. “Moody’s has rated Modi’s handling of India’s economy a step above JUNK.

The outlook remained unchanged. “The decision to downgrade India’s ratings reflects Moody’s view that the country’s policymaking institutions will be challenged in enacting and implementing policies which effectively mitigate the risks of a sustained period of relatively low growth, significant further deterioration in the general government fiscal position and stress in the financial sector,” the ratings firm said on Monday.Moody, which last assigned a rating on India’s sovereign credit rating in November 2018, has also estimated a decrease in India’s GDP by 4 per cent. ‘Baa3’ rating is the lowest investment grade -- just a notch above ‘junk’ status.

A 14-year-old student, a girl, allegedly committed suicide in Malappuram and her parents alleged that she was disturbed as she could not attend online classes since the family did not have either a TV or smartphone.The girl was missing from her house since Monday afternoon and her fully burnt body was later recovered from an isolated plot near her house in Valancherry. The police also recovered an empty bottle of kerosene near her body. The police said that after preliminary investigation, they found it to be a suicide and recovered a suicide note too. The body of the girl was later sent to post-mortem in Manjeri medical college hospital.School authorities say the Class 9 student was good in her studies. Her parents said though they had a small TV, it was under repair for last three months. The repair was delayed because the family head, a Dalit farm hand, was without work in last three months due to lockdown.“It was a sad incident. The government started virtual classes without preparations. There are at least 20,000 students in Malappuram and Wayanad districts alone who have no access to TV or smartphones. Big publicity to online classes pushed the deprived students to a corner,” said local legislator Abid Hussain Thangal who later visited the house of the deceased.State Education Minister C Raveendranath has sought a report from the district education officer. The virtual classes were inaugurated by Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday and he said the new system will revolutionise the system.Many educational activists and others had warned the government to not rush with virtual classes as there are two lakh students who have no access to TV or smartphones. “We warned the government about this. The government should have done this after ensuring access to all students,” said educational activist Shajir Khan.Meanwhile, Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi has sought a list of families and others who have no access to TV and smartphones. In a letter to the district collector, Gandhi said that online classes pose significant challenges for students with limited access to smartphones, computers and reliable internet connections.Gandhi also said that he would like to extend his support and assistance in procurement of devices for students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-girl-allegedly-commits-suicide-for-missing-online-classes-mp-rahul-gandhi-offers-help/story-RbYEOiznZWZPfvELnEkGwI.html

02-06-2020||India||In praise for PM Modi, Aaditya Thackeray delivers a message to ministers||There has been great deal of cooperation between Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Home Minister Amit Shah and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on battling the Covid-19 challenge, Shiv Sena leader Aaditya Thackeray has said.“These three major entities have been in great cooperation and coordination with each other. That by far has kept politics aside during the time of the pandemic,” Thackeray, who is also Maharashtra’s minister for tourism, environment and protocol, told Hindustan Times in an interview.Aaditya Thackeray’s surprise praise for PM Modi and Amit Shah in an interview to Hindustan Times comes a week after a war of words broke out between Uddhav Thackeray and Railways Minister Piyush Goyal on Twitter over the Shramik Specials to ferry back migrant labourers that carried on past midnight.Also read: Amit Shah dials Uddhav Thackeray after Bandra protest sets off political firestormUddhav Thackeray was last month seen to be critical of the central government for allotting only half the 80 trains requested by the state for migrant workers, mostly from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, who wanted to go home.Piyush Goyal had promptly hit back, telling Maharashtra that he could arrange to send 125 trains for the stranded migrants provided the state makes sure that they do not run “empty”. Goyal also asked the state to send a list of stranded migrants who had to be accommodated in these trains and then fired a string of reminders on social media to drive home the point that it was the Shiv Sena-led coalition that was unprepared, not the railways.Asked about this back-and-forth between the Shiv Sena government and the central minister, Aaditya Thackeray appeared to suggest that some amount of friction was inevitable when different parties are in power at the Centre and the state.WATCH: Aaditya Thackeray on unlocking Maharashtra | On The Record“I feel that if you have two different parties or two different coalitions are ruling at the state and Centre, then there will always be those tussles,” the 29-year-old Thackeray said before going ahead to underscore that Uddhav Thackeray was in sync with PM Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah. And this had helped in the fight against coronavirus disease.“I don’t think this is the right time for any minister to speak about any politics,” Thackeray said.The Shiv Sena and the Bharatiya Janata Party have been bitter rivals after the Sena walked out of their alliance of 30 years over the chief minister’s chair. Uddhav Thackeray took over as chief minister in November last year in coalition with erstwhile rivals - Congress and the NCP - after a short spell of central rule.Also read: ‘Not the right time for any minister to speak about politics,’ says Aaditya ThackerayBut Uddhav Thackeray, whose party frequently criticises the BJP-led central government, rarely directs his attacks at PM Modi or Shah.When Uddhav Thackeray was staring at the possibility of missing the six-month deadline to become a member of the legislative council, Thackeray had sent an SOS to PM Modi for help. Within two days, Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari wrote to the Election Commission to hold elections to the legislative council that eventually led to Thackeray being elected a member of the council unopposed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-praise-for-pm-modi-aaditya-thackeray-delivers-a-message-to-ministers/story-ve8pKQEiF695t54Odf72mK.html

02-06-2020||India||How dangerous is Cyclone Nisarga? IMD issues red alert, low-lying areas to be evacuated||Nisarga, the deep depression that is currently moving northwards in the Arabian Sea, will hit the Maharashtra coast on Wednesday.The India Meteorological Department said in its weather outlook on Tuesday morning that Nisarga is expected to become a cyclonic storm on Monday morning and a severe cyclonic storm by 5.30 pm on June 2.It further said that Nisarga is moving at a speed of 11 kmph. “It lay centred over East-Central Arabian Sea about 280 km west-southwest of Panjim (Goa), 490 km south-southwest of Mumbai (Maharashtra) and 710 km south-southwest of Surat (Gujarat),” said the IMD.“It is very likely to move nearly northwards during next six hours and recurve north-northeastwards thereafter and cross north Maharashtra and adjoining south Gujarat coast between Harihareshwar (in Maharashtra’s Raigad) and Daman during the afternoon of June 3,” the IMD further said.The storm is currently packing in winds upto 90-100 kmph. The wind speed is expected to be 105-115 kmph gusting to 125 kmph when it nears landfall. Scientists said that Nisarga could inundate low-lying areas especially in cities like Mumbai and cause structural damage from falling trees and power poles. This has raised concern over how the city, already strained for healthcare resources on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, will cope.The weather department has advised fishermen to not venture into the southeast Arabian Sea, Lakshadweep area and along and off Kerala coast during next 48 hours.Alert has been sounded in Mumbai, its suburban districts, Thane, Palghar, Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts in view of Nisarga. The IMD on Monday issued a red alert for these districts for June 3 and 4. A red alert - which indicates the possibility of extremely heavy rain of more than 204.5 mm - is a warning for residents to take action and keep safe from adverse impact. Both Maharashtra and Gujarat governments have ordered people living in low-lying areas on the coastal regions to be evacuated and shifted to safer places.With the formation of two cyclones - in the Bay of Bengal (Amphan) and Arabian Sea (Nisarga) - within two weeks of each other, scientists warn about the possibility of more pre-monsoon cyclonic storms in coming years due to warmer ocean temperatures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-dangerous-is-cyclone-nisarga-imd-issues-red-alert-low-lying-areas-to-be-evacuated/story-X2gyMvZXSmkJa4iHcYoc5L.html
02-06-2020||India||Copyright extends to theme, plot and storyline of literary works: Bombay High Court||Bombay High Court has held that in the case of literary artworks, copyright extends not only to the expression of the core idea but also to its theme, plot and the storyline.The order pronounced on Friday came on a plea filed by Urdu writer Shamoil Ahmad Khan who claimed that Falguni Shah and two others had infringed his copyright in one of his short stories, Singardan (Dressing Table), and produced a web series under the same title.It is being aired on an online platform, Ullu, and is also available on YouTube, Khan said. Khan claimed that producers of the web series had not only copied the title but also the entire plot, narrative and characters of his story.Producers of the web series opposed his plea for an injunction claiming that save and except the central idea of Singardaan, there was no other similarity between Khan’s work and the web series. They claimed that the central idea—a man taking away a dressing table from a brothel to his home during riots and its use leading to changes in the behaviour of the womenfolk at home—by itself was not entitled to any copyright protection.They submitted that the depiction of the central idea in the web series, including the pathos, texture, treatment, purport and presentation, was materially different from Khan’s story and therefore there was no question of infringement.The argument, however, failed to impress upon justice SC Gupte.The judge said it’s true that copyright does not extend to ideas, or schemes, or systems, or methods and it is confined to their expression, and if the expression is not copied the copyright is not infringed.Justice Gupte clarified that in a literary artwork a germ of an idea is developed into a theme and then into a plot and then the final story with the help of characters and settings. It is the combination of all these elements which give a substance to the work, he said.“If one goes on stripping the final work of these various elements, one may finally come to the bare idea or abstraction which no longer enjoys copyright protection.”Justice Gupte said when someone strips the story of Singardaan of its embellishments, the motivations and the tribulations of its characters and their actual actions, they get the plot and the storyline.“The above narration is the life and blood of the plaintiff’s (Khan’s) story,” said the judge. He added it cannot be said that the writer has copyright only in the details of expression and that those are embellishments - the details which have no essential bearing on the theme, plot and storyline of Khan’s work.“If someone steals this theme, plot and storyline, is he not thereby plagiarising the expression of the plaintiff’s work? Can the above theme, plot and storyline be simply dismissed as non-protectable ideas of the plaintiff’s work and not its expression? I think not.

02-06-2020||India||Supreme Court shifts sexual assault case involving Haryana gangster’s son to Delhi||The Supreme Court has shifted the trial in a sexual assault case from Haryana to Delhi after the minor victim’s family produced evidence to show how the accused, son of a noted gangster in the state, was issuing mortal threats that made it impossible for them to attend trial in a Gurgaon court.The series of threats were by way of WhatsApp messages and phone calls to the girl’s mother. She has been threatened with dire consequences if the family proceeds with the case. Presenting the entire evidence in the Supreme Court, the victim’s mother told a single judge bench of Justice Hrishikesh Roy, “petitioner (mother) can no longer attend court hearings for the fear of her life.”She was assisted by advocate Nikhil Borwankar who prepared the petition under Section 406 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) asking the Supreme Court to transfer the case from Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) in Gurgaon to Delhi.The judge examined the series of threats issued to the petitioner since November 29, 2018. It began three months after the victim’s parents lodged the complaint with the Mahila (women) Police Station, in Haryana’s Manesar. The accused was staying in the same housing society as the victim. He raped her first on August 16, 2018, and subsequently that same month on August 27 in the basement of the building. The victim had gone down to pick her football when the incident occurred.The Supreme Court judge held, “Considering the nature of the allegations as also the grounds pleaded by the petitioner on the background of the first respondent and his family, I deem it fit and proper to allow the transfer petition.” The case will now be tried at District Court Complex, in Delhi’s Saket.The father of the accused is a notorious gangster Rakesh Banjara who has several cases of murder, abduction and assault against him. On the day of the crime, the victim’s family alleged that Rakesh came to the society and threatened them from pursuing the complaint. The police had launched a manhunt against the accused who went absconding and was arrested on September 9, 2018.Days after the incident, the victim’s family reported about the threatening calls and WhatsApp image of a ‘revolver’ to the Haryana Police on August 30. No complaint was registered. The petitioner produced photographs in the Supreme Court to show the accused in the company of senior police officers at social events.According to petitioner’s lawyer Nikhil Borwankar, “Based on unverified school certificate, the accused was shown to be 17 years of age and tried as a juvenile. This cannot be as he was attending college at the time of incident. This order passed by the magistrate is pending before the apex court in a separate matter.”The accused faces the charge of aggravated sexual assault under Section 6 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) and criminal intimidation punishable under Section 506 of IPC. The apex court has directed immediate shifting of the case records to the Delhi court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-shifts-sexual-assault-case-involving-haryana-gangster-s-son-to-delhi/story-xXWCdRsETQ9A8798fgiChN.html

02-06-2020||India||Cyclone Nisarga expected to bring 100 kmph winds: All you need to know||A developing tropical cyclonic storm called Nisarga in the Arabian Sea is moving northwards at a speed of four kilometre per hour and is currently 550 kilometre away from Mumbai. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), Nisarga is likely to make landfall between Harihareshwar in Maharashtra’s Raigad and Daman on June 3.The IMD has issued a red alert for six other districts - Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Dhule, Nandurbar and Nashik, between June 3 and 4.The development of NisargaA low pressure area and a depression are the first two levels used by the IMD to classify cyclones based on their intensity. The depression is likely to intensify and become furious and turn into a cyclonic storm in the wee hours of the morning on June 2 and then into a severe cyclonic storm by June 3.Nisarga’s pathThe deep depression is currently 550 kilometre south-southwest of Mumbai in Maharashtra and 800 km south-southwest of Surat in Gujarat. The depression is likely to move northwards till June 2 morning. It will then re-curve north-northeastwards and cross north Maharashtra and south Gujarat coasts during June 3 afternoon, which is when it is likely to make landfall.Wind speed accompanying NisargaWhen it becomes a severe cyclonic storm, Nisarga will be packing in a wind speed of 105-115 kmph, gusting to 125 kilometre per hour on June 3. According to the IMD, it again will weaken into a cyclonic storm with wind speed of 60-70, gusting to 80 kilometre per hour on June 4. Cyclone Amphan, which struck India’s eastern coast last month, was packing in winds upto 180 kmph. It had turned into a super cyclone (category 5 according to IMD) and made landfall ad extremely severe cyclonic storm.Cyclone’s impactThe coastal areas of Maharashtra and Gujarat may experience high speed winds and extremely heavy rainfall during this period. The fishermen have been advised not to venture in the sea. IMD’s cyclone track shows that Nisarga will cross very close to the Mumbai coast while entering the land.PreparationsThe Maharashtra government on Monday sounded an alert in Mumbai and neighbouring districts in view of the approaching cyclonic storm Nisarga. Ten units of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) have been deployed in vulnerable districts, while six others have been kept on a stand-by, officials said. Union Home Minister Amit Shah spoke to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray through video conference and took stock of the state’s preparedness to tackle any eventuality.

02-06-2020||India||Amid Covid-19 restrictions, Kashmir cherry farmers demand minimum support price||Fruit growers in Kashmir have demanded minimum support price (MSP) for cherry as despite the high yield this year farmers are facing massive losses due to limited demand amid the coronavirus pandemic.Kashmir Fruit Growers cum Dealers Union (KFGDU) has criticised the administration of Jammu and Kashmir for its “failure” in providing adequate air and railway facilities for transporting the fruit during the Covid-19 restrictions as well as disregarding their request to provide minimum support price to help farmers during the crisis.“The union has also suggested and made a humble request to the Lt Governor’s administration for consideration of minimum support prices of cherry at Rs 100/kg so that the poor cherry growers of the valley, who have constantly suffered heavy losses since 2014 devastating floods, may feel a sigh of relief but it is unfortunate that LG’s administration did not pay any attention to the said proposal,” Bashir Ahmad Basheer, KFGDU’s chairperson, said in a statement.Officials say the tentative figures showed the production of cherries in the Kashmir Valley this year is about 12,000 metric tonnes. Last year, the figure was around 11,700 metric tonnes.Kashmir exports some 3,500 to 4000 metric tonnes of cherries to other states every year.Despite the sizeable yield, farmers are a worried lot because of the lack of demand following the closure of markets and difficulties in transporting the cherries from farms to markets amid Covid-19-related restrictions. They are getting a price of Rs 45-50 per kg as against double the amount last year.Basheer said that owing to the apprehension of total damage of the cherry crop this year owing to the restrictions, the growers in the valley are staring at losses of crores of rupees with around 10 lakh families directly or indirectly connected with this industry.“In case, the preventive measures are not taken well in advance there is a threat of the fruit industry of the UT, which is the backbone of J&K’s economy, turning sick,” he said.Pandurang K Pole, the divisional commissioner of Kashmir, said there was no past precedent for such demand or its fulfilment. “Is there an example that such a thing has happened in the past which we could emulate?” he asked.He said they met the growers’ union and apprised them of what was possible and what was not.“Given the circumstances, the supply chain of every commodity is disrupted not just cherry. They know what is possible and not possible. Nevertheless, we are facilitating them,” he said.The union said that there was around Rs 150-200 crore turnover cherry annually of which 60% of the total comes from Makhmali and Mishri varieties which were traditionally sent to Mumbai markets.“As per past practice, these varieties are transported to Mumbai market through Air Cargo or by railways. Since Mumbai is extremely hit by Covid, the fruit mandi in Mumbai is therefore completely non-functional for any business,” he said.Kashmir produces four types of cherries—Awwal Number, Double, Mishri and Makhmali —with the last two sold to other states.“In this connection, the management of KFGDU took up the matter with LG administration and airlines for providing air and rail facilities for transportation of cherry to different stations of the country but despite vigorous follow-up, the governor’s admin failed to provide facilities causing acute mental agony to cherry growers,” the union president said.Pole said that the administration was facilitating the transport of the fruit to Delhi while Mumbai was a red zone.“Every day five to seven trucks are going to major markets of Delhi. Although 70% of the supply of cherry goes to Mumbai, but that is closed. There are no flights and the fruit is very perishable,” he said.The union also said the Canning Owners Association, which lift the Double Cherry variety of the fruit, are reluctant in view of the closure of canning factories and uncertainty of its marketing.Pole said they have given a go-ahead to 20 canning units to start functioning. “The units will be opening and some 4,000 metric tons will be used for canning,” he said.Cherries are grown on an estimated 2,713 hectares in Kashmir and over the years the production has increased.

The drug is being touted as a potential treatment for Covid-19.The approval was given following consultation with the subject expert committee of the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).“The drug is given in the form of an injection and that is why it has to be administered under the supervision of a doctor in a hospital setting,” the source said.Gilead Sciences, the patent holder of the drug, has the complete data about the pre-clinical and clinical studies for remdesivir, the source added.The medicine has been issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat hospitalised coronavirus-infected patients.Meanwhile, the applications of two Indian pharmaceutical companies -- Cipla and Hetero Labs -- seeking permission to manufacture and sell remdesivir in India is still under consideration.Gilead Sciences Inc has entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with pharma firms, including three domestic majors Cipla, Jubilant Life Sciences and Hetero, for manufacture and distribution of remdesivir.The Indian Council of Medical Research had earlier said anti-viral medication remdesivir, which was used during the Ebola outbreak, may inhibit the SARS-CoV-2 replication and research on its efficacy in the treatment of Covid-19 is a part of WHO’s ‘Solidarity Trial’.According to a recently published study in the New England Journal of Medicine, two out of three critically ill coronavirus patients who were on oxygen support showed signs of improvement when they were administered remdesivir.All new drugs have to undergo trials before getting approval for marketing them in India.But the New Drug and Clinical Trial Rules, 2019, provide for certain clauses, according to which the provision of waiver of local phase-III clinical trials of the drug is approved and marketed in certain countries (as notified from time to time) subject to certain conditions like national emergency or epidemics in public interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-drug-regulator-grants-gilead-sciences-marketing-authorisation-for-remdesivir/story-J3uUtC6afBNPR7Qb1RWEWL.html

Considered to be the worst-ever civil unrest in the US in decades, violent protests have engulfed at least 140 cities across the country in the days following the death of George Floyd, the 46-year-old African-American man who was pinned to the ground in Minneapolis on May 25 by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath. “We all have a responsibility to recognize this pain and the systemic racism that has caused it, and also to act by listening, reading, and supporting organizations that make justice their mission. This is especially important if you come from a place of privilege that protects you in some capacity,” wrote the top India American corporate leader, who is counted among the world’s most powerful women.In photos: Rage and anguish from George Floyd protests spreading across US cities “As we all consider how to heal this wound, I ask that we not lose sight of the power of our voices. I’ve always believed that confronting bias publicly is essential. If you see a bad actor, say it out loud and set an example for those around you,” she said. “And don’t be afraid of what you don’t know. Instead, be eager to participate in conversations that may make you uncomfortable and commit to learn more. It may not be easy, but it is critical,” she asserted. Nooyi cautioned that the road ahead will “undoubtedly be challenging”, and the scale of the work that needs to be accomplished is staggering. “Let’s vow to be kind, to roll up our sleeves, and to be part of the force that bends this path toward justice,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-all-have-a-role-to-play-says-indra-nooyi-as-protests-sweep-us/story-byHwnqINeR8S13dbgKkcmM.html
02-06-2020||India||‘Not the right time for any minister to speak about politics,’ says Aaditya Thackeray||Maharashtra’s tourism, environment and protocol minister Aaditya Thackeray spoke to Hindustan Times about the Covid-19 numbers, the unlocking plan, testing protocols, and the condition in state hospitals, among other issues. Edited excerpts:We’re speaking at a time when various states are emerging from the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19, which has hit Maharashtra particularly hard. We’ve been on top of the situation, and the public has been very cooperative. Covid is one scenario where no one in the world has been able to predict how long it will go on for. We just started the mission “begin again” yesterday because lockdown has been around for 2-3 months and as we start opening up, it has to be very slow, staggered, carefully planned. We went into lockdown in a measured manner starting March 8, and the same has to be done while coming out of it.What’s the thought process behind opening shops but not malls? There have been several deliberations on this, from directions and observations from the World Health Organization to what other countries are doing. For instance, if there is single air circulation, is that more detrimental than not having air conditioning was one of the factors. Footfall was another factor. From June 2 or 3, we’ve made it possible for people to at least step out and get into a little bit of physical exercise but not go indoors. Then June 5 onwards, alternate sides of roads for shops, and from June 8 onwards, offices with 10% staff. All of this is always going to be trial and error, it will be a system of cooperation of citizens, a two-way process. What’s the thinking on schools? They usually open in June. Most of the schools, especially in red zones, are quarantine facilities and so we can’t open them right now. But, we’ve begun a process of speaking to people in the sector and how education can continue. Can we do it offline in green zones, what does social distancing mean, these are some of the deliberations that we are having. There was a meeting that the CM held with people yesterday in terms of education and technology and we can’t let academic year pass by without education beginning. Our school’s ratio is one teacher to 45 kids, so how do we do physical distancing there?The numbers in Maharashtra look... Scary, yes. The first and foremost principle we have to use as a government is to not fear the numbers. In cities such as New York and those in Brazil, the population is very different from the density in Mumbai. A higher number isn’t a higher infection that a neighbouring city or state, it only means that the government has been more successful in identifying the carriers and isolating them. You will probably have a peak sooner rather than later and so we have told all our officers on the ground, don’t fear the numbers, chase the case. Why aren’t you testing asymptomatic people? We are going by ICMR guidelines. The world over, asymptomatic people don’t need any intervention; they can self-isolate. Guidelines say you have to test high risk group between fifth and tenth day, and we are going by that. When you speak of hospital beds, we recall images from KEM hospital with patients lying amid dead bodies. Can you explain those pictures? We have said this before - there are a few things that have to be set in process once someone dies of Covid. You have to seal the body, you have to wait for someone to claim it, but apart from that, we are also clearing a lot more space for the mortuary. You have to understand the pressure the medical system is facing around the world, as no one has seen so many patients at one time in one place. So no matter what you do, you will have a shortage, as you have tons more people than you have hospital beds or ICU beds. We’ve moved into creating more hospital and medical facilities. In terms of beds for isolation wards, we had only 400 but in the last 15 days, we’ve gone to 5,000. We have to grapple with the gravity of the situation.Do you feel that you are getting all the help and cooperation you need from the Centre? If you have two different parties or two different coalitions are ruling at the state and Centre, then there will always be tussles. There has been great cooperation within the parties in the state and with the Prime Minister, the home minister and the chief minister. These three major entities have been in great cooperation and coordination with each other. That by far has kept politics aside during the time of the pandemic. I don’t think this is the right time for any minister to speak about any politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-don-t-think-this-is-the-right-time-for-any-minister-to-speak-about-politics/story-fs5LD63hBdasto12ekMjBK.html
02-06-2020||India||AP moves Supreme Court challenging HC verdict on reinstatement of state election commissioner||The Andhra Pradesh government on Monday moved the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the state high court’s orders reinstating retired IAS officer Nimmagadda Ramesh Kumar as the State Election Commissioner (SEC).In a special leave petition filed in the apex court, the state government challenged the high court’s order striking down the ordinance promulgated last month which sought to reduce the tenure of the SEC from five years to three years and appointing a judicial officer of the rank of a high court judge as the SEC.The SLP is expected to come up for hearing on Tuesday or Wednesday, a state government official familiar with the development said.Meanwhile, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy is leaving for New Delhi on Tuesday to discuss the issue with legal experts in New Delhi to present the government’s case in the Supreme Court. He would also be meeting Union home minister Amit Shah and other ministers to discuss certain issues pertaining to the state, the official quoted above said.On Friday, the high court bench comprising chief justice JK Maheshwari and senior judge Satyanarayana Murthy also struck down two government orders that followed the ordinance removing Ramesh Kumar as SEC and appointing retired judge of Madras high court V Kanagaraj in his place. The high court ruled that Kanagaraj’s appointment was illegal and Ramesh Kumar be allowed to continue for the rest of his tenure.Challenging the high court judgment, the Andhra Pradesh government argued that it had all the powers to appoint the SEC and the appointment of Justice Kanagaraj was done as per the statute. It appealed to the court to set aside the orders of the high court and allow Justice Kanagaraj to continue as the SEC.The state government, however, ignored the circular issued by Ramesh Kumar, soon after the judgment, that he was resuming charge as the SEC as per the court order and that he would discharge his duties fairly and impartially as he had done in the past and as mandated.State advocate general Sriram Subrahmanyam said Ramesh Kumar had no right to resume charge as the SEC as the high court had not mentioned when he should be reinstated. “There are several ambiguities in the high court judgment and we are filing an SLP in the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the high court order,” the advocate general said.Ramesh Kumar, however, said the high court had clearly directed the state government to restore his position as SEC and allowed him to continue in office until completion of his tenure which ends on March 31, 2021.“In the wake of the high court judgment, Justice Kanagaraju ceases to hold office as SEC. Since the office of SEC, a Constitutional post, cannot remain vacant, my position becomes status quo ante and I stand restored to the office of the SEC. Hence, I resumed the charge and proceedings were issued accordingly,” he said.Stating that the stand taken by the government was illegal, he said he was contemplating moving the high court again seeking restoration of his position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ap-moves-supreme-court-challenging-hc-verdict-on-reinstatement-of-state-election-commissioner/story-v0p8vmeHDr5ZbiW0uKU63J.html

He posed as Gautam, brother of a media person, to establish contact with an individual working in the Indian Railways. He tried to gain his confidence by pretending that he needed information about rail movements for his brother who was supposedly doing a story on the Indian Railways and for which he was willing to pay, said Anil Mittal, Additional PRO (Delhi Police).However, police said the real motive was to lure and trap the railway staff and then acquire information about movement of Army units and hardware via trains.In a statement released on Sunday, the Ministry of External Affairs had said, “The government has declared both these officials persona non grata for indulging in activities incompatible with their status as members of a diplomatic mission and asked them to leave the country within 24 four hours.” Sources had said the officials were working at the visa section of the Pakistan High Commission and confessed during the interrogation that they worked for Pakistani spy agency ISI.The sources had also said that the two officials were handing over Indian currency and an iPhone for providing them the documents.They had initially claimed that they were Indian nationals and even produced fake Aadhaar cards, the sources had said. In 2016, Delhi Police had busted an espionage racket, involving a Pakistan High Commission staffer, Mehmood Akhtar, who was allegedly involved in getting information about BSF deployments along the Indo-Pak border. He was expelled by India for spying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-high-commission-officials-wanted-to-extract-details-of-army-movements-via-trains-report/story-VBsWlxKPh7xmgbusqvxmYK.html

The central government which granted relaxations in a fresh set of guidelines that will be effective this week onwards has allowed for the reopening of restaurants, malls as well as places of worship from June 8 onwards. “All activities which have been allowed by the central government will be allowed in Goa too, but in Goa we may take some other steps too. We will finalise the decision by Monday evening if some other relaxations need to be given,” Chief Minister Pramod Sawant said. Goa being a ‘green zone’ state with all the recent cases of Covid-19 being detected among those who are entering the state, already enjoys considerable relaxations including the reopening of markets, public transport, shops and private offices. Ahead of the end of the fourth phase of the lockdown, the Goa Chief Minister had raised the issue of the reopening of restaurants and malls. “Most activities have started in Goa except for restaurants, hotels, malls, gyms. We believe that at least restaurants, malls and gyms should start with social distancing norms,” Sawant had said.The Goa government has already relaxed curfew norms allowing people to remain out of their homes up to 9 pm except for the movement of goods and essential services. “The night curfew period has been relaxed a bit as per the new guidelines. Goa will stick to the new timings and we will try to enforce this curfew at border check posts to ensure that our team can handle the flow of incoming people,” Revenue Secretary Sanjay Kumar had said at a press conference on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-to-allow-malls-restaurants-to-reopen-in-tune-with-central-guidelines-cm-sawant/story-1hKXY5Yj1zX95ao5Br4lJP.html

The positive cases came in two phases with five cases in the first phase and 102 cases in the late evening update. “Among the 444 samples tested for Covid-19 in Tripura, 5 people found positive,” Tripura chief minister Biplab Kumar Deb posted on Twitter in the afternoon. “Alert: 102 people found Covid-19 positive today in Tripura, out of 578 samples tested. All of them have travel history. As the numbers are rising, I urge everyone to stay extra conscious, follow government instructions and co-operate with us,” Deb tweeted late evening.

02-06-2020||India||Lok Sabha proceedings may move to Central Hall in Covid-19 reshuffle||To ensure the functioning of Parliament within constraints imposed by the coronavirus pandemic, Rajya Sabha (RS) chairperson Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha (LS) Speaker Om Birla have asked officials to explore the possibility of shifting the Lok Sabha proceedings to the Central Hall of Parliament for the upcoming monsoon session that usually starts in July.They have also asked if this can be accompanied with Rajya Sabha meetings being shifted to the Lok Sabha chamber, in a move that will be unprecedented in the history of Indian Parliament. Keeping in mind that the battle against the Covid pandemic might be a prolonged one, the presiding officers of both houses met on Monday to discuss various possibilities related to the monsoon session, said an official familiar with the development. Naidu and Birla also asked the two secretaries general of both Houses to look at the feasibility to hold the sitting of the two Houses on alternate days. In the longer term, they also explored the idea of having a virtual parliament with the use of technology. A column in Hindustan Times, on May 22, had floated the proposal to shift the LS to the central hall, and the RS to the LS chambers. All these measures, officials pointed out, are to ensure the government’s social distancing and health norms are adhered to while ensuring the normal functioning of the House. Naidu and Birla “have directed the Secretaries-General to examine the feasibility of using the Central Hall of Parliament appropriately to ensure social distancing,” said the official quoted above. “The options to be considered include; holding the meeting of Lok Sabha in the Central Hall with the Rajya Sabha shifting to the chamber of Lok Sabha and the sittings of both the Houses to be held on alternate days. The two officials were also directed to examine in detail various technical and other arrangements to be ensured to enable smooth functioning of both the Houses,” he added. The Central Hall, right in the middle of the Parliament Building, has a capacity to hold more than 800 people. This will allow 543 members of the Lok Sabha to sit, while maintaining a degree of distance. Similarly, 245 members of the Rajya Sabha can sit comfortably in the Lok Sabha chamber, ensuring social distancing. Chakshu Roy, head of legislative and civic engagement, PRS Legislative Research, said, “Putting the central hall for legislative functioning will be another innovative use of Parliament’s physical resources. And after a gap of 70-odd years, central hall will reverberate with the sound of spirited debate. And it’s not the first time, that the chamber of one house has been used by the other. In Hyderabad, the chambers in the legislative assembly complex were used by the two houses of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana legislatures in different shifts.”Even as the usual schedule of the monsoon session is from July to August, the government, however, has the power to hold it later. The Constitution of India says that the gap between the last day of the previous session and the first day of the next session should not be more than six months. As the budget session of Parliament was abruptly ended on March 23 amid Covid pandemic, the government has the liberty to call the session even in September, if it wants.The dates of the monsoon session will be decided after the proposals of cabinet committee on Parliamentary affairs proposals are cleared by the union cabinet.Both the presiding officers also discussed the need to adopt technology to enable online Parliament sessions as a long-term option when regular meetings look possible. “They have noted that since there is no requirement of maintaining confidentiality of the proceedings of both the Houses, which are open to general public besides being telecast live, virtual Parliament is an option to be explored,” said the official. In the meeting, the two presiding officers decided to refer the issue of virtual meetings of the parliamentary standing committees to the Rules Committees of both the Houses.The two Secretaries-General gave a briefing on the possibilities of virtual meetings of various committees of Parliament. They maintained that apart from a safe technological platform, complying with the rules of confidentiality of deliberations in such meetings is important. They also spoke about infrastructure upgrade to be undertaken to enable virtual meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ls-may-move-to-central-hall-in-covid-19-reshuffle/story-RRXXLex5U3LL4FdiGJFDyM.html
02-06-2020||India||Minimum Support Price for summer-sown crops hiked by 50-80%||The Union Cabinet on Monday approved federally fixed minimum support prices (MSP) for 14 kharif or summer-sown crops, which will give farmers a 50-83% return on their cultivation cost, agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar said.The announcement came as the June-to-September monsoon for 2020, predicted by the India Meteorological Department (IMD) to be normal, made its onset over Kerala, its first port of call in the Indian mainland, on June 1, as predicted. A normal monsoon will likely lessen the strain on the agriculture economy from widespread disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. The summer rains are critical because nearly 60% of India’s net arable land lacks irrigation and nearly half the population depends on a farm-based livelihood.The MSP for paddy, the main summer staple, has been raised by ~53 per to ~1,868 per quintal for the 2020-21 crop year, which will give a return of 50% on the cost of cultivation, according to an official statement. “(The) government has increased the MSP of Kharif crops for marketing season 2020-21, to ensure remunerative prices to the growers for their produce,” a Cabinet statement said. The highest increases in MSP are for nigerseed (~755 per quintal) followed by sesamum (~370 per quintal), urad (~300 per quintal) and cotton (~260 per quintal). “The differential remuneration is aimed at encouraging crop diversification,” the official statement said.For cotton, the MSP has been increased by ~260 to ~5,515 per quintal, Tomar said. The support prices of arhar or tur, a type of lentil, has been fixed at ~6,000, which represents a 58% return over cost of cultivation. This is an increase of ~300.The increase in MSP for kharif crops is in line with the Union Budget 2018-19 announcement of fixing the MSPs at a level of at least 1.5 times of the countrywide weighted average cost of production, which aims to give at least 50% returns for each crop. According to official calculations, the returns to farmers over cost of production are estimated to be highest in case of the coarse cereal, bajra (83%), followed by urad (64%), tur (58%) and maize (53%).“To correct demand-supply imbalances, the government has realigned the MSPs more in favour of oilseeds, pulses and coarse cereals to encourage farmers to shift to these crops,” said Abhishek Agrawal, an analyst with Comtrade, a commodities trading firm.Fresh indicators show the country’s farm sector, which employs nearly half the population, has coped well with the Covid-19 crisis, with a larger summer crop area than last year, higher sales of fertilisers and seeds, and better prices, leading Reserve Bank of India governor Shaktikanta Das to last month call it a “beacon of hope”.The farm sector is poised to grow at least 3% in 2020-21, despite disruption in the economy due to the coronavirus pandemic, which will aid overall growth, according to state-run think-tank Niti Aayog’s assessment in April.There are other indicators too, ranging from sowing to input sales, which show the agriculture economy is heading into the summer-sown or kharif operations in decent shape.Farmers have planted rice in about 3.48 million hectares (1 hectare equals 2.4 acre) compared to 2.52 million hectares during the corresponding period of last year, an increase of nearly 37%, official data as on May 21 show.The area under pulses — a major summer crop with up to 70% share in farm incomes in some state — stands at nearly 1.28 million hectares against 0.96 million hectares during the same period of last year, which is higher by one-third (33%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msp-for-summer-sown-crops-hiked-by-50-80/story-FRkkFbeDm4gGRSovW6SOBN.html

The panel on Monday submitted its report dated May 28 to the National Green Tribunal that had constituted it. The leak left 12 people dead and caused hospitalisation of nearly 500 people. The committee, which included retired high court judge justice B Seshaseyana Reddy, conducted the inquiry at the plant on May 11, 12 and 14.The plant’s director (operation) and production manager G Raju tried to explain that he and others tried to add para-tertiary butyl catechol to reduce the intensity of the leakage. But two other employees of the company – M Achyut, shift-in-charge and P Balaji, manager – who were on the duty when the accident took place, told the panel that the moment they saw dense vapours coming from the tank, they ran away.“The mishap at LG Polymers plant was only due to human failure and negligence of the persons in charge of the plant and maintenance personnel of the storage tank. The management did not take proper care of the affected storage tank and it resulted in the leakage of Styrene due to auto-polymerisation,” the committee said in its report, a copy of which HT has seen.The employees told the committee that they did not see anyone making any effort to subside the intensity of the vapours. “Had any workmen been present at the effected tank, he should have been the victim of vapour gas and he should have been shifted to the hospital for treatment,” the committee observed. “The accident occurred on the wee hours of May 7 because of the excessive generation of heat...,” LG Polymers officials were not immediately available for a comment||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lg-polymers-staff-ran-away-at-time-of-leak-panel-report/story-ZTCj2IQBGdlZApKf1PdKsK.html
02-06-2020||India||Stand-off along LAC is for India, China to resolve: Australia envoy||Against the backdrop of a standoff between border troops of India and China, Australia on Monday said it was for the two countries to resolve the face-off as no third country could interfere in the matter.In an online media briefing ahead of the June 4 virtual summit between Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, Australian high commissioner Barry O’Farrell said his country’s foreign policy is set by its national interests, including a desire for stability in the South China Sea.O’Farrell reiterated Australia’s support for India’s call for the reform of multilateral bodies such as the World Health Organization (WHO) so that they are better placed to deal with future challenges and crises.Asked specifically about the India-China standoff along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and whether such issues would figure in the upcoming summit, the envoy replied: “In relation to the border issue, that’s a matter for China and India to resolve and not a matter for Australia to interfere with.”In an apparent reference to the US president’s attempts to mediate in the matter, which have already been rebuffed by India, O’Farrell added: “That’s reflected by what we’ve seen over the past week, when others have sought to suggest that they could step in and provide some advice. Clearly it’s going to be a matter that India and China will resolve.”Australia, he said, has a “substantial interest in stability and adherence to international law” in the South China Sea, where it is “concerned about the militarisation of disputed features” and has urged all parties to take meaningful steps to ease tensions.While Australian vessels and aircraft will continue to exercise their rights to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea, all claims in that region should be resolved according to international law, and the “most sensible place” to resolve such matters is the UN, he said.The virtual summit, organised after Morrison called off a visit to India in January because of bushfires in Australia and also due to the impact on the Covid-19 crisis, is expected to see the signing of several agreements, including the Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) for reciprocal access to military logistics facilities.O’Farrell said the summit is also expected to advance an ambitious agenda that will include working together to improve regional and multilateral institutions, including on Covid-19 and public health, boosting science and tech cooperation, stronger collaboration on cyber-security and critical technology, maritime issues in the Indo-Pacific, critical mineral supply chains, education, and water resource management.“It’s as crucial as ever for like-minded democracies and important partners like Australia and India, at this time, work together to shape the type of region and type of world in which we want to live presently but importantly, post-Covid,” he said.India and Australia are committed to a free, open, inclusive and secure Indo-Pacific and strengthening and making their economies more resilient, have a shared goal of strengthening international institutions, he added.“I think there are many opportunities for India and Australia to assist each other’s supply chains. We support India’s policy of Make in India…but we have elements and resources that can strengthen and make more resilient the supply chain here in India,” O’Farrell said.The MLSA will make it easier for the militaries of both countries to conduct complex exercises and facilitate access to each other’s bases. Asked if Australia still hopes to be part of the Malabar naval exercise conducted by India, the US and Japan, the envoy replied: “Would we like to join Malabar? Yes, but we recognise that’s a matter for the partners who run the exercise to decide.”Defence ties between Australia and India, he said, are at a historic peak and activities had quadrupled in the past six years. The two sides also have a shared commitment as Indian Ocean powers and an obligation to secure a free and inclusive Indo-Pacific, he added.“That alone is going to ensure that our defence relationship in this part of the world is maintained,” O’Farrell said, adding last year’s edition of AusIndex, a bilateral naval exercise, witnessed Australia’s largest ever military deployment to India and MLSA will assist in future submarine patrols in the Bay of Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stand-off-along-lac-is-for-india-china-to-resolve-australia-envoy/story-xdrE4KgfVs6btkVFrIyntI.html
02-06-2020||India||For online reach, Rahul Gandhi may soon start podcasts||Former Congress president Rahul Gandhi may soon try his hand at podcasting to counter Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s monthly radio broadcast Mann Ki Baat, people familiar with the development said.“Right now, we are at the planning stage and are discussing the finer points with the experts and asking them how to go about it,” said a Congress office bearer who refused to be named.A podcast is an audio message or discussion that is transferred or relayed digitally. “Once finalised, Gandhi’s podcast will be a counter to the Prime Minister Mann Ki Baat radio broadcast,” claimed the functionary quoted above.The former Congress chief launched his YouTube channel some time ago but started promoting it only during the lockdown period. It has so far got 294,000 subscribers.While Gandhi’s conversation with migrant workers saw a viewership of 752,000, his video interaction with health experts professor Ashish Jha and professor Johan Giesecke on coronavirus had over 90,000 views.PM Modi’s YouTube channel has 6.45 million subscribers apart from 57.9 million followers on Twitter and 45 million on Facebook. Gandhi has 14.4 million followers on Twitter and 3.2 million on Facebook.“We are also exploring other platforms such as LinkedIn,” the Congress functionary said.He claimed that the party’s social media campaigns during the coronavirus-induced lockdown had attracted “huge response” from the public.“Our ‘Speak Up India’ online campaign on May 28 was a huge hit. Over 5.7 million party leaders and workers uploaded their messages on different social media platforms throughout the day,” the functionary added.The daylong campaign was launched to put pressure on the central government to accept demands for providing immediate financial aid to farmers, migrant workers, daily wage earners and small businesses hit by the pandemic.“It is important for politicians to communicate with citizens in whatever ways they can. Podcasting can be a great way to interact, but only if the politician allows for a two-way communication. They have to find a way of talking with the people, not just to the people,” said Amit Verma, a Mumbai-based podcaster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-online-reach-rahul-may-soon-start-podcasts/story-9VSrmxUsS8HoxSLmqXqniP.html
02-06-2020||India||Rainfall favourable for breeding of locusts, but may slow march||Good rainfall in Rajasthan, other parts of northwest India, and cyclone Nisarga forming over the Arabian Sea will create favourable conditions for the breeding of crop-munching desert locusts along the India-Pakistan border but temporarily stall their movement as well, the Centre’s Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) said. “If there are good rains in Rajasthan, they will stay in the desert region and not move away, and if mature swarms come, they will breed here in the next 15 to 30 days depending on weather conditions,” said LWO deputy director K L Gurjar.Locust swarms reached new locations, chomped through vegetation and crops across farmlands in Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh and prompted the Centre to issue a warning to 16 states last week. “They are presently in Madhya Pradesh’s Shivpuri area and moving towards Ashok Nagar, Bikaner and Nagaur in Rajasthan, Nagpur in Maharashtra and Jhansi in Uttar Pradesh. They are unlikely to move towards Bihar,” said Gurjar. He added LWO controlled a new swarm that entered Jaisalmer on Sunday. Locust swarms pose a severe risk to India’s agriculture this year, the UN has warned, and prompted the authorities to step up vigil, and deploy drones and other equipment to detect their movement. Their attacks are known to cause a considerable drop in agricultural output. Locusts can fly up to 150km in a day and a one-square-kilometre swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people.R K Jenamani, a senior scientist at the National Weather Forecasting Centre, said the formation of any cyclonic circulation over the Arabian Sea brings moisture into north India and causes rain. “We are expecting thunderstorm and rainfall activity in east Rajasthan and in Delhi NCR [National Capital Region] on June 4 and 5. It has already been raining in parts of east Rajasthan,” he said.Northwest India is expected to receive excess monsoon rainfall at 107% of the long-period average this year, according to India Meteorological Department. Excess monsoon rains will also provide favourable conditions for the breeding of locusts in arid areas.According to the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO), moist sandy or sand/clay soil to depths of 10-15 cm below the surface, some bare areas for egg-laying, and green vegetation for hopper development are the favourable conditions for their breeding. LWO has said it has controlled swarms over 55,000 ha across Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh mainly by spraying pesticides. According to FAO’s update dated May 27, locust swarms are forming in the spring breeding areas and migrating east to the India-Pakistan border ahead of the monsoon.“Spring-bred immature adult groups and swarms that arrived in Rajasthan from the west continued to move east in the eastern portion of the state and to the central states of Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra. As of 26 May, at least one swarm had reached to the northeast of Bhopal. Much of these movements were associated with strong westerly winds from Cyclone Amphan in the Bay of Bengal. Control operations are underway,” it said.Several successive waves of swarms can be expected until July in Rajasthan with eastward surges across India as far as Bihar and Odisha followed by westward movements and a return to Rajasthan based on changing monsoon winds. These movements will cease as swarms begin to breed and become less mobile. Swarms are less likely to reach south India, FAO said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rainfall-favourable-for-breeding-of-locusts-but-may-slow-march/story-nK2lQMh5GaKFm42hx2egIP.html
02-06-2020||India||Pak mission official posed as journo kin: Police||A day after two Pakistan high commission officials – Abid Hussain Abid and Mohammad Tahir Khan – were apprehended on charges of espionage, the Delhi Police special cell probing the case said “Abid operated under several fake identities to lure persons working in organisations and departments of his interest”.Deputy commissioner of police (special cell) Pramod Singh Kushwah said during the investigation, it emerged that Abid impersonated posed as the brother of a media person to establish contact with an individual working in Indian Railways.“Abid tried to gain that individual’s confidence by pretending that he needed information about rail movements for his brother who was supposedly doing a story on Indian Railways and for which he was willing to pay money. The real motive was to lure and trap the railway staff and then acquire information about movements of Army units and hardware via trains,” added Kushwah said.A case under the Official Secrets Act has been registered by the special cell.A senior Delhi Police officer privy to the development said two Pakistani nationals were expelled by India after a joint team of Military Intelligence (MI) and special cell caught them allegedly obtaining classified materials on Indian security installations from defence personnel, who were used as decoy, at Bikanerwala Chowk in Karol Bagh at 10.45am on Sunday, A third Pakistani national was driving the car, in which the two came to collect classified materials and landed in the trap. The driver was let off after the Indian law enforcement authorities questioned him and found that he was not involved in the espionage.“It was the driver who confirmed that Abid and Tahir were associated with the ISI,” the officer said, adding that both of them were handed over to the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).A statement issued by Pakistan’s Foreign Office spokesperson, Aisha Farooqui, said the Indian Charge d’Affaires was summoned to the Foreign Office in Islamabad on Sunday for a strong demarche that conveyed Pakistan’s condemnation of the Indian decision to declare two officials persona non grata.“It was conveyed that the Indian action was in clear violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations and the diplomatic norms,” Farooqui said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-mission-official-posed-as-journo-kin/story-feOhFNxEAEejqCWDZruGYK.html
02-06-2020||India||Global factors lead to cooking gas price hike||India is losing the advantage of low international oil prices as its cost of crude imports in the rupee terms has surged by 69% in just two months, forcing state-run oil marketing companies to raise cooking gas prices for the first time after February by Rs 11.50 per cylinder. “For the month of June 2020, there has been an increase in international prices of LPG. Due to an increase in the prices in the international market, the RSP [retail selling price] of LPG in the Delhi market will be increased by Rs 11.50 per cylinder,” state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) said in a statement on Sunday.A 14.2 kg cooking gas cylinder in Delhi is now priced at Rs 593. Prices in other cities will vary depending on local levies.IOC said retail prices of cooking gas was slashed substantially by Rs 162.5 a cylinder in Delhi last month to Rs 581.50 because of a steep decline in international prices.India’s average crude oil import price surged by about 69% to Rs 2,516.77 per barrel in just two months, from Rs 1,491.57 a barrel on April 1, according to Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell of the oil ministry.Benchmark Brent crude, which had plunged from over $51.9 per barrel on March 2 to below $20 a barrel by April 21 due to slack demand and oversupply, is now hovering around $38 a barrel amid chances of prolonged supply cut by producers’ cartel and demand revival due to lifting of Covid-19 lockdowns in many countries, including India.There are indications that international oil prices may go further up as the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, particularly Russia (together OPEC+), are expected to meet on June 4 to discuss extending production cuts beyond this month.On April 12, OPEC+ decided to cut overall crude oil production by 9.7 million barrels per day or a 10th of global output from May 1 for an initial period of two months ending June 30. The producers’ cartel decided to shun the price-war among them and agreed to a synchronised supply cut to stabilise crude prices.SC Sharma, a former officer on special duty at the erstwhile Planning Commission, said two signs of international oil prices firming up are global demand is picking up fast, and OPEC+ could further extend the production cuts. “That may lead to oil prices going beyond $40 per barrel. In that situation, the oil companies may have to hike petrol and diesel prices by Rs 5 and Rs 6.5 per litre [respectively] or the government may have to reduce the additional excise. As the prices have not been revised by OMCs [oil marketing companies] for a month, any increase in import price beyond $30 per barrel may adversely impact OMCs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/global-factors-lead-to-cooking-gas-price-hike/story-jY6Tarsw6BODLm5ErtBaVN.html
02-06-2020||India||Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar’s kin linked to foiled J&K plot||The initial investigation into last week’s failed bombing in Pulwama’s Ayangund area has revealed the involvement of Mohammad Ismail Alvi, alias Lambu -- a close relative of Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) chief Maulana Masood Azhar and the current head of the Jaish in the Valley -- who also played a key role in February 14, 2019 suicide bombing that killed 40 CRPF troopers, according to two counterterrorism officers familiar with the matter.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is likely to take over the probe of the failed bombing soon, the officials added. Ismail Lambu is already wanted by the federal agency for last year’s attack. One of the officers cited above said that Lambu, who is often referred to as Ismail Bhai and also goes by the moniker Fauji Baba, came to India sometime in late 2018 and helped Mudassir Khan, Khalid, and Mohammad Umar Farooq (last year’s Pulwama attack co-conspirators who were killed in encounters a month later) in collecting explosive material including gelatin sticks from stone quarries in the Valley, and ammonium nitrate from local shops.He took over the reins of Jaish in Kashmir this January after its Kari Mufti Yasir was killed by Indian forces.Ismail is an IED expert and helped other bombers of February 14, 2019 attack fit the bomb in Maruti Eeco van,” said the officer. Ismail’s deputy Sameer Ahmed Dar was also involved in last year’s suicide bombing, which was followed by an Indian launching air strike on a terror facility in Pakistan’s Balakot, and a subsequent dogfight between the air forces of the two countries.“We have information that Ismail Lambu planned to carry out similar car bombing in one of the camps or a convoy. The bomb was placed in the Santro car but it was detected on time in the wee hours on Thursday (May 28),” a second officer said. Forensic experts have hinted that the unexploded bomb was made of RDX, ammonium nitrate and nitroglycerin -- the same combination as the 2019 Pulwama bomb.“The similarities in both incidents shows the signature of JeM although it appears that Hizbul Mujahideen and Lashkar-e-Taiba also may have participated in last week’s attempt as all the outfits are under pressure from Pakistan army to conduct a spectacular terror strike” the second officer said.The officers said they are scouring several “virtual mobile numbers”, social media accounts and emails to ascertain further plans of JeM, LeT and HM, which are operating under the banner of The Resistance Front (TRF), a front propped up by Pakistan to avoid embarrassment at international level.A virtual mobile number works through a server for which users sign up for a service by downloading and app on their smartphones. A number is generated by the app syncing it with a social media platform or an email account without linking it to a SIM card.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/azhar-kin-linked-to-foiled-j-k-plot/story-N73YV6YQTjBysnVGnWf3eP.html
02-06-2020||India||Monsoon arrives, normal rains likely, says IMD||The south-west monsoon made an onset over Kerala on Monday morning, keeping its normal arrival date of June 1, with heavy to very heavy rains and strong southwesterly winds blowing many parts of the state.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast on Monday that the monsoon this year was likely to be “normal” at 102% of long period average (LPA) with a model error of (+/-) 4% According to IMD’s second long-range forecast update for the monsoon, north-west India is expected to receive excess monsoon rainfall at 107% of LPA; Central India is likely to get 103% of LPA, while south peninsula and north-east India area likely to receive 102% and 96% of LPA respectively with a model error of (+/-) 8%. The forecast added that there is a 41% probability of a “normal” monsoon, 25% probability of an “above normal” monsoon, and only 5% probability of deficient rains. In its first long-range forecast released in April, IMD predicted that monsoon rain will be 100% of LPA this year. Normal is defined as 96 to 104% and above normal as 104 to 110% of LPA.Monsoon rains are critical for farmers in India, where nearly half the people directly or indirectly depend on agriculture for a living. Around 60% of the country’s net-sown area does not have any form of irrigation. Millions of farmers wait for the rains to begin the summer sowing of major crops such as rice, sugar, cotton, coarse cereals and oilseeds. Half of India’s farm output comes from summer crops dependent on these rains.“We are expecting very good rains this year. As you can see the forecast is skewed towards the positive side,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, Union ministry of earth sciences.According to global weather experts, El Nino Southern Oscillation (Enso) neutral conditions are prevailing over the equatorial Pacific, and neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions are prevailing over the Indian Ocean. El Nino is a climate pattern characterised by high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Nino years in India are linked to below-normal monsoon rains and higher-than-normal heat waves. Last year, weak El Nino conditions prevailed, leading to the delayed onset of monsoon.Global models are also indicating cool Enso conditions are likely to prevail this monsoon with some possibility of development of weak La Nina conditions, characterised by low sea surface temperatures across the east-central Equatorial Pacific in the later part of the monsoon season. “La Nina is good for the monsoon unlike El Nino. This is good news,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.“We can’t say anything this year because we haven’t made a forecast. Conditions are favourable for a good monsoon because of Enso neutral conditions. In fact, personally I think there will be above normal rains,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice president (climate and meteorology) at Skymet Weather, which couldn’t release a forecast this year because of logisitical issues related to the national lockdown and because they are in the process of updating their models.According to IMD’s national weather forecasting centre, the monsoon has already advanced into all of the South Arabian Sea; Lakshadweep, most parts of Kerala and even some parts of Tamil Nadu. Kozhikode received 15cm rain from Sunday morning to Monday 8.30am, while Trivandrum and Kannur received 6cm rain each.“Kerala received very good rains and monsoon is advancing well. The winds are south-westerly and westerly, very strong winds. There are convective clouds over south-east Arabian Sea. All parameters for monsoon onset are now met,” said K Sathi Devi, head of the National Weather Forecasting Centre. He added that the monsoon winds were strengthened by the depression formed over south-east Arabian Sea, which is likely to develop into a cyclone on Tuesday. More than 70% of the 14 rainfall monitoring stations used to declare the monsoon onset over Kerala have reported rainfall during last 48 hours. Westerly winds have strengthened in the lower levels (wind speed up to 20 knots) and deepened up to 4.5km over the south Arabian Sea, IMD said. IMD’s onset guidelines include a clause that says 60% of 14 stations enlisted in Lakshadweep, Kerala and Coastal Karnataka should report rainfall of 2.5mm or more for two consecutive days.The south-west monsoon normally sets in over Kerala around June 1. It advances northwards, usually in surges, and covers the entire country around July 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-arrives-normal-rains-likely/story-7YUJ5BqDnobgxW5NDeCByN.html
02-06-2020||India||Was the 1882 Great Bombay Cyclone a hoax?||Mumbai: As the city braces for possible impacts of the predicted cyclone making its way towards the Maharashtra coast, state officials might find it hard to call upon lessons of a previous cyclone alleged to have originated in the Arabian Sea and hit the Mumbai almost 140 years ago.Available newspaper reports from the time indicate that a tropical cyclone had made landfall on June 6, 1882 in then Bombay that led to more than one lakh deaths. However, the Columbia University, New York, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune published a peer-reviewed research paper in May 2019 stating that the said event never occurred.According to Dr Parthasarathi Mukhopadhyay of IITM Pune, one of the contributing authors, the purported event was nothing but smoke and mirrors. “After Columbia University professor Adam Sobel raised the query all the way from New York about the authenticity of the Great Bombay Cyclone, which has found its way in various research papers, books, and the like, internationally, we decided to investigate the source. After extensive research across a plethora of platforms, including archived daily weather reports, we found that the entire thing was a hoax,” he said.He added that, though, there have been impacts of passing cyclones over Mumbai over the years. “The most impactful cyclone of these was Phyan, which crossed Konkan and the Mumbai region in November 2009, when high speed winds were recorded over the city. However, at least three of the five cyclones which took place in the Arabian Sea last year had impacts in the form that they increased rainfall activity over Mumbai and surrounding areas,” he said.To base its findings, the paper says that no maps of the cyclone, which is a usual practise, are available from the time. “The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has maintained archives of cyclone tracks as well as daily weather summaries from 1877-1970 for both, the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea. Maps are available in particular for all cyclones occurring in each calendar month during the period of 1877-1883. The map for June shows no cyclone originating in the Arabian Sea in 1882,” the paper said.LS Rathore, the former director general of the IMD, however, contends otherwise. “This is not a hoax. Owing to improper dissemination of information at the time, the true facts were never published or recorded. Even if they were, they have been lost over time. Over the years, we were told that data had been lost since the then Bombay was a much smaller city at the time with hardly any infrastructure (compared with what it has today), and occupations were mostly dependent on port activities, which was most impacted due to the cyclone. However, one would have to speak to a historian for a more detailed description about the impact,” he said.City-based historian Deepak Rao said there is no comparison between the situation today with what may have happened in 1882. “Extension of Greater Mumbai, including the suburbs of Mumbai, started from Mahim, which was added only in 1945. In 1882, the seven islands were not seen together as Greater Mumbai and the population would have been devastated completely if a cyclone would have taken place,” he said.Dr. Mukhopadhyay added that if more than one lakh people would have died in a city as small as south Mumbai alone, the British would have documented it as a record. “But we found nothing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-the-1882-great-bombay-cyclone-a-hoax/story-1ZC3JntgiymyfNw6ExDKiL.html
02-06-2020||India||Maharashtra, reeling under Covid-19, braces for Cyclone Nisarga’s impact||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday held a video-conference with home minister Amit Shah on the state’s preparedness for a likely severe cyclonic storm that is expected to make landfall on Wednesday in which at least 20 million people stand to be affected along the Konkan coastline, including Mumbai city. Maharashtra state officials have snapped into disaster preparation mode as the India Meteorological Department (IMD) sounded a red alert for seven districts, including Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad on Monday, on account of a depression in the Arabian Sea that is expected to form into cyclone Nisarga, a severe cyclonic storm, on June 2 and make landfall on June 3 as well as cause heavy rainfall within inland districts till Thursday.Shah reportedly offered Thackeray the use of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) teams from neighbouring states. Maharashtra has 16 teams of which 10 are deployed in areas likely to be affected including three in Mumbai, two each in Palghar and Raigad and one in Thane. Each team comprises 45 jawans, and a 24x7 control room is also expected to function out of the Mantralaya building in Mumbai. More teams may be deployed on Tuesday, as the IMD revises its bulletin based on the progress of the weather system.Maharashtra, which is already reeling under the highest case load of Covid-19 infections in the country — it crossed the 40,000 mark on Monday — has issued special instructions to officials to devise ways in which positive patients can be shifted to safer locations in case the cyclone makes landfall as expected on Wednesday afternoon. It has also advised districts to maintain social distancing norms during the shift to relief shelters, if and when that happens. Non-Covid hospitals across the districts would be made available to tackle the disaster, a press note released by the CM’s office on Monday stated. Those living in “kaccha houses” along the coastline would also be shifted, and are being informed about the cyclone via loudspeakers, the note stated.Thackeray has also asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to shift slum dwellers staying in low-lying areas of the city to safer locations. Mahesh Narvekar, chief officer of BMC disaster management cell said, “Our preparations are underway based on the regular updates from IMD authorities.”Strict warnings have been issued to the fishing community to avoid entering the Arabian Sea and municipal officials are focusing on low-lying areas in Mumbai to determine whether Covid-19 centres would need to be re-located due to the very heavy rainfall expected over the following two days, an official said on the condition of anonymity.Prominent low lying areas in Mumbai include Hindmata and the flower market at Dadar, Century Bazar in Worli, Lower Parel station, SV Road Sacred Heart Church in Andheri, Malad and Marol naka, among others. Many of these areas are also part of wards which have some of the highest cases in the Mumbai city. At least 11 teams comprising officials of the fire, health and disaster management departments, as wells as 94 lifeguards are on alert, PS Rahangdale, chief fire officer of the Mumbai fire brigade and deputy municipal commissioner of the city disaster department said.The state has an outlay of Rs 1611 crore under its State Disaster Management Fund (SDRF), from which the funds are drawn for the natural calamities such as cyclones. The central government is expected to take up a share of 75% of the outlay. According to an official from the relief and rehabilitation department, district collectors are delegated the power to use these funds in case of calamities. “We have started making announcements near the shoreline. We have also asked power stations to be on alert in case of an emergency. All beaches will also be closed and we are also considering imposing section 144 to prevent any sort of crowding near the beaches,” Palghar district collector Kailash Shinde said.A cyclone alert has been sounded to all residents living within three km of the coast and a list of people who need to be evacuated from the low-lying in Palghar is being prepared, said Kiran Mahajan, deputy collector (general administration) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-reeling-under-covid-19-braces-for-impact/story-FB062bzXCad4iGrLcYDavI.html
02-06-2020||India||Cyclone Nisarga: IMD issues red alert for Mumbai||Nisarga, a possible severe cyclonic storm that is expected to result from a depression forming in the southeast and adjoining east-central Arabian Sea and Lakshadweep area will impact Mumbai city which may experience high speed winds and extremely heavy rainfall, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said Monday as it issued a red alert for six other districts including Palghar, Thane, Raigad, Dhule, Nandurbar and Nashik between June 3 and 4. On Monday, the depression lay 310 km southwest of Panjim in Goa, 570 km south-southwest of Mumbai in Maharashtra and 800 km south-southwest of Surat in Gujarat. The depression is likely to move northwards till June 2 morning and then re-curve north-northeastwards and cross north Maharashtra and south Gujarat coasts during June 3 afternoon, which is when it is likely to make landfall. As per the current IMD forecast, the entire region between Daman (near Gujarat) and Harihareshwar in Raigad — comprising the Konkan coastline, which encompasses Mumbai — as well as some inland districts of Maharashtra, stand to be affected. However, the next 48 hours may bring further changes to the forecast Sunitha Devi, in-charge of cyclones at the IMD, said.“The landfall is expected towards the south of Mumbai. Since the Arabian Sea system is dynamic there are a few predictability issues. There might be further changes in the coming 48 hours depending on how the [weather] system moves,” she said. “An orange alert (to be prepared) will be issued 48 hours before the landfall while a red alert (to take action) will be issued 12 to 24 hours for the affected areas,” she said. Also read: Here’s how to live track Cyclonic storm Nisarga“It will pass over this region as a severe cyclone but there is a marginal reduction in wind speed expected. Mumbai is likely to experience high speed winds as the cyclone makes landfall south of the city,” Devi said.“We haven’t given an exact location of landfall yet. It will be shared as soon as reliable information is available but Mumbai will be impacted,” M Mohapatra, director general, IMD confirmed.Scientists said that Nisarga, which is likely to make landfall on June 3 afternoon could inundate low lying areas especially in cities like Mumbai and cause structural damage from falling trees and power poles. This has raised concern over how the city, already strained for healthcare resources on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, will cope. What’s more, each year the monsoon brings the city to a halt as train lines, streets and drains get flooded leaving lakhs of commuters stranded for hours. A red alert — which indicates the possibility of extremely heavy rain of more than 204.5 mm — is a warning for residents to take action and keep safe from adverse impact. It has been sounded for seven districts including Mumbai for Wednesday, and additionally on Thursday for Palghar. An orange alert has been sounded for Mumbai and Thane for Thursday.“The wind speed along with rough sea conditions in the landfall region will be capable of damaging weak structures such as huts, and thus affect poor people and fishermen who live on the coastline,” Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and doctoral researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom, said. While it is still early to ascertain where the storm might make landfall, the experience of cyclone Amphan — which the eastern coastline on May 21 and left 86 dead as well as millions homeless — is still fresh in national memory. “In the interest of public safety, local evacuation is advisable in such areas, which is likely to be challenging in the ongoing Covid-19 scenario.” Mumbai is facing a severe healthcare infrastructure crunch as hospitals and care facilities are unable to cope with the high number of cases, which stood at 41,099 cases as on June 1. “Central and state government agencies are trying to take all steps possible to prevent damage. We are specially advising fishermen in Maharashtra, Kerala, Coastal Karnataka, Gujarat, Goa, Lakshadweep to avoid going to the sea till June 4. Those out at sea should return immediately as sea can be very rough from now on,” Mohapatra said.According to the IMD bulletin, the system is expected to become a cyclonic storm by 11.30 am and a severe cyclonic storm by 5.30 pm on June 2. It is likely to make landfall by Wednesday afternoon. The wind speed is expected to be 105-115 kmph gusting to 125 kmph over east-central and northeast Arabian Sea along and off Maharashtra coast. “It is very unusual for a cyclone to make landfall in or near Mumbai or even on the Maharashtra coast. The storms that form during monsoon onset over Arabian Sea usually move towards Oman. Cyclone Phyan had impacted these districts in 2009 and even Mumbai had recorded extremely heavy rains,” Devi said.With the formation of two cyclones — in the Bay of Bengal (Amphan) and Arabian Sea (yet to be formed Cyclone Nisarga) — within two weeks of each other, scientists warn about the possibility of more pre-monsoon cyclonic storms in coming years due to warmer ocean temperatures. Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll, senior scientist, Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) Pune said, “We already see a detectable increase in the number of post-monsoon tropical cyclones over the Arabian Sea— and we need to ask if we are we moving towards a similar trend during the pre-monsoon also. We don’t know yet if this is part of a rising trend.”Scientists argue that anomalously warm ocean temperatures have aided in the genesis and rapid intensification of recent cyclones. The sea surface temperature in the Arabian Sea presently is as high as 32°C compared to a normal of 28°C expected during this season.However Mohapatra said that other parameters also need to be considered in the case of the expected cyclone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-on-cyclone-red-alert/story-9tip0ZW71o5U58RQonBS7L.html
02-06-2020||India||I don’t think this is the right time for any minister to speak about politics: Aaditya Thackeray||Edited excerpts:We’re speaking at a time when various states are emerging from the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19, which has hit Maharashtra particularly hard.We’ve been on top of the situation, and fortunately, the public has been very cooperative and patient. Covid is one scenario where no one in the world has been able to predict how long it will go on for. We just started the mission “begin again” yesterday because lockdown has been around for 2-3 months and as we start opening up, it has to be very, very slow, staggered, carefully planned. We went into lockdown in a measured manner starting March 8, and the same has to be done while coming out of it.In this slow unlocking you have decided to open shops but not malls? What’s the thought process?There have been several deliberations on this, from directions and observations from the World Health Organization to what other countries are doing. For instance, if there is single air circulation, is that more detrimental than not having air conditioning was one of the factors. Footfall was another factor to see how spacing and social distancing would happen. From June 2 or 3, we’ve made it possible for people to at least step out and get into a little bit of physical exercise but not go indoors. Then June 5 onwards, alternate sides of roads for shops, and from June 8 onwards, offices with 10% staff. All of this is always going to be trial and error, it will be a system of cooperation of citizens, a two-way process. The slower we go the better.What’s the thinking on schools? They usually opens in June.Around June 10-13 is usual opening time. Most of the schools, especially in red zones, are quarantine facilities and so we can’t open them right now. But, we’ve begun a process of speaking to people in the sector and how education can continue. Can we do it offline in green zones, what does social distancing mean, these are some of the deliberations that we are having. There was an hour-long meeting that the CM held with people yesterday in terms of education and technology and we can’t let academic year pass by without education beginning. Our school’s ratio is one teacher to 45 kids, so how do we do physical distancing there?The numbers in Maharashtra look...Scary, yes. The first and foremost principle we have to use as a government is to not fear the numbers, especially when you have a pandemic of a global scale. In all cities such as New York and those in Brazil, the population is very different from the density in Mumbai. One feature is Mumbai’s community toilets and the way our houses are planned and the number of people living in them. A higher number isn’t a higher infection that a neighbouring city or state, it only means that the government has been more successful in identifying the carriers and isolating them. You will probably have a peak sooner rather than later and so we have told all our officers on the ground, don’t fear the numbers, chase the case. Why aren’t you testing asymptomatic people?We are going by ICMR guidelines. The world over, asymptomatic people don’t need any intervention; they can self-isolate. Guidelines say you have to test high risk group between fifth and tenth day, and we are going by that. When you speak of hospital beds, we recall images from KEM hospital with patients lying amid dead bodies. Can you explain those pictures?We have said this before -- there are a few things that have to be set in process once someone dies of Covid. You have to seal the body, you have to wait for someone to claim it, but apart from that, we are also clearing a lot more space for the mortuary. You have to understand the pressure the medical system is facing around the world, as no one has seen so many patients at one time in one place. So no matter what you do, you will have a shortage, as you have tons more people than you have hospital beds or ICU beds. We’ve moved into creating more hospital and medical facilities. In terms of beds for isolation wards, we had only 400 but in the last 15 days, we’ve gone to 5,000. We have to grapple with the gravity of the situation.There has been some amount of tension between Union ministers and state ministers, the exchange between CM Uddhav Thackeray and railway minister Piyush Goel. Do you feel that you are getting all the help and cooperation you need from the Centre?If you have two different parties or two different coalitions are ruling at the state and Centre, then there will always be those tussles. Most importantly, there has been great cooperation within the parties in the state and with the Prime Minister, the home minister and the chief minister. These three major entities have been in great cooperation and coordination with each other. That by far has kept politics aside during the time of the pandemic. I don’t think this is the right time for any minister to speak about any politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-don-t-think-this-is-the-right-time-for-any-minister-to-speak-about-politics-aaditya-thackeray/story-Fr94E5LgQO6Xvub1t7Hb1N.html
02-06-2020||India||Unlock 1: States differ on travel, quarantine protocols||Hyderabad/ Thiruvananthapuram: Andhra Pradesh and Kerala on Monday decided to continue with the requirement of electronic passes for entry into the states even as the Centre’s fresh guidelines allowed unrestricted interstate movement from June 1.The Centre on Saturday released details of the first of a three-phase plan--Unlock 1.0--to lift stringent restrictions imposed over two months ago to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. Places of worship, shopping malls, hotels and restaurants can also open from June 8.Hundreds of people from Telangana on their way to Andhra Pradesh were sent back because they did not have electronic passes. There was much confusion until 11 am on Monday when Andhra Pradesh police chief Gautam Sawang issued a statement saying restrictions on interstate movement would remain in force “till a further decision is taken”. The statement said all those seeking to come to Andhra in private vehicles should obtain an e-passes and undergo medical tests.“Those seeking to come from less coronavirus-affected states will be sent to home quarantine. Those coming from highly-affected states will be sent to institutional quarantine for seven days and they have to undergo tests for Covid-19. If they test positive, they should be sent to hospitals and if they test negative, they would have to be home quarantined for another seven days,” Sawang said. Kerala announced a series of measures to ease the Covid-19 lockdown even as curfew in containment areas (121) until June 30 will continue and there will be no entry into the state without passes. “...people who come for brief visits and for business are exempted but they will have to produce travel details. We cannot take chances now. More than 75% of the state’s [Covid-19] cases are imported,” said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. He added interstate travellers will have to obtain passes. Vijayan said a decision on religious places and restaurants will be taken after June 8 in consultation with the Centre. “In containment areas, the lockdown will be complete. It will be a curfew. There is no room for any complacency in such areas,” he said. The government has allowed marriage functions but guests should not exceed 50.Odisha said it will impose a weekend lockdown in 11 of the state’s 30 districts, where Covid-19 cases have surged. The highest single-day spike of 156 cases pushed the state’s tally to 2,104 on Monday. Odisha chief secretary Asit Tripathy said everything in these 11 districts will remain shut over weekends except hospitals, nursing homes, medical stores and fuel stations. He added the cases have risen because of the migrant workers, who have returned from Covid-19 hotspot states like Maharashtra and Gujarat. Tripathy said the workers account for 95% of the new Covid-19 cases in quarantine centres.States like Goa and Madhya Pradesh said they have adopted the guidelines fully and allowed interstate travel without passes and reopening of stand-alone shops. These states would decide on opening restaurants, malls, gyms and religious places on June 8 as per the Centre’s order.Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said they will grant all relaxations the Centre has allowed. “Most activities have started in Goa except for restaurants, hotels, malls, gyms. We believe that at least restaurants, malls and gyms should start with social distancing norms,” Sawant had earlier said.Himachal Pradesh chief secretary Anil Khachi said hotels have been opened only for non-tourism purposes for businesspersons and those coming on official tours. He added other than them, only residents of Himachal can book rooms there. Khachi said for the interstate travellers, seven-day institutional quarantine would continue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-differ-on-travel-quarantine-protocols/story-TOfqcLEbFlLKqW1eHYN0NL.html
02-06-2020||India||Govt issues list of over 1,000 imported items banned at CAPF canteens, then revokes it||An order issued by an authority under ministry of home affairs over the weekend listing “imported” products removed from the list items for sale at canteens run for central police force personnel was rescinded on Monday after confusion over some of the items classified as foreign, people aware of the matter said. A reworked list would be issued soon, one of them added.Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) director-general AP Maheshwari, who heads the Welfare And Rehabilitation Board of central police forces, said the order regarding the delisting of certain products was erroneously issued. “The list has been withdrawn and action is being initiated for the lapse,” he said.Among the products listed in the rescinded circular were Dabur’s products like Real Juice, around 30 products of Bajaj Electricals, almost entire range of VIP Industries that produces bags and trolleys, and several electronics and electrical items of international brands which are largely made in India only. Other items that were delisted by rescinded order were Timex’s watches, Proctor and Gamble’s shaving range, Philips home appliances, Hindustan Unilever Ltd, Panasonic’s vacuum cleaners, speakers, etc, Nestle’s milk powder, LG’s range of appliances as well as Colgate’s oral hygiene products. Kendriya Police Kalyan Bhandar (KPKB) chief executive officer RM Meena, who is a deputy inspector general rank officer, issued the order on May 29, a fortnight after Union home minister Amit Shah on May 13 announced the canteens will sell only indigenous products beginning June 1. Shah’s announcement came a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for popularising local commodities to make India a self-reliant country in the face of the challenges the Covid-19 pandemic poses.KPKB, which runs the canteens across India, created three categories of the products sold there, according to the order, a copy of which HT has seen. Category 1 included those made in India from scratch. Category 2 listed products manufactured or assembled in India with imported raw material. Category 3 specified 1,026 “purely imported products” and included chocolates, air conditioners and televisions manufactured by Italian and South Korean firms.The order said there were seven companies importing finished products and selling them in India. It underlined that they had categorised the products solely based on the information provided by the firms manufacturing them. “In case of any litigation, the information provided by the firm will be used as evidence and the onus to prove the information is correct will be on the respective firm,” the order said.Shah on May 13 said the canteens do an estimated business worth Rs 2,800 crore annually. The canteens cater to 5 million family members of about one million personnel involved in internal security and border guarding duties.The central police forces include CRPF, Border Security Force, Indo-Tibetan Border Police, Central Industrial Security Force, Sashastra Seema Bal, National Security Guards and the Assam Rifles.There are around 119 master and 1,625 subsidiary canteens across the country — from border to Maoist-insurgency-hit areas. The canteens were set up in 2006 following demands by central paramilitary personnel who cited the army has such canteens. They have been selling local products to a large extent, following an October 2019 order that asked them to shun foreign brands and introduce “swadeshi” goods, including food items, accoutrements for combat and regular duty uniform, bed sheets, towels, household goods, clothing and stationery. Harish Bijoor, Brand Guru and founder at Harish Bijoor Consults Inc said “These are rather quick reactions which certain central bodies have taken. It’s not a good thing to do. You (government) should not hurt a made in India product. The fallouts need to well thought-out before jumping the gun, which definitely was the case here. There is a need to have greater degree of care, intent and listing. Just because a brand name sounds foreign, it doesn’t mean it is foreign made”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-issues-list-of-over-1-000-imported-items-banned-at-capf-canteens-then-revokes-it/story-X6ePa6gOYIIElCXT5ncEGO.html
02-06-2020||India||24 Rajya Sabha seats to go to polls on June 19: Election Commission||Elections to fill 24 seats in the Rajya Sabha — 18 older vacancies and six new ones — will be held on June 19, the Election Commission (EC) announced on Monday. Earlier this year, 55 vacancies had arisen in the Upper House, of which 37 candidates were elected unopposed in March. Elections for 18 remaining seats were earlier scheduled for March 26, but had to be deferred after the spread of the coronavirus pandemic and the imposition of the national lockdown to curb its spread.As per the EC’s revised schedule, polling will be conducted for four seats each from Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat and Karnataka; three seats each from Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan; two seats from Jharkhand; and one seat each from Manipur, Mizoram, Arunachal Pradesh and Meghalaya. For the six new seats, the last date for nominations is June 9, and last date of withdrawal is June 12.The commission has also decided that chief secretaries will depute a senior officer from the state to ensure that the extant instructions regarding Covid-19 containment measures are complied with while making arrangements for conducting the elections.The current strength of the house is 224; of which the BJP has 75 members and the NDA’s tally is 88. Parties that are not part of the NDA, but are friendly to the BJP include YSRCP, AIADMK, BJD and TRS — these together have 27 MPs. The Congress has 39 MPs and the opposition block with regional parties has 69 MPs. There are three independents and one nominated member. MDMK, PMK and Tamil Maanila Congress have a single member each. Of the 24 seats going to polls, the BJP is expected to bag 2 of the three seats in MP, one each in Rajasthan and Jharkhand, two in Karnataka, and one each in Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram. In Andhra Pradesh, YSRCP is expected to win all four. The battle for the upper house will also see some significant political heavyweights in the fray. The BJP is aiming to win both the seats from MP; it has named Jyotiraditya Scindia and Sumer Singh Solanki as candidates here. The Congress has nominated Digvijaya Singh and Phool Singh Baraiya.In Jharkhand, the BJP’s candidate is state unit president Deepak Prakash while the Congress has named Shahzada Anwar. In Gujarat, the BJP’s candidates are Ramilaben Bara and Abhay Bhardwaj and the Congress has named Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki.From Rajasthan, the BJP has named its state vice-president Rajendra Gehlot as candidate, while the Congress contestants here are KC Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi. In Andhra Pradesh, the YSR Congress nominees are P Subhash Chandrabose, Mopidevi Venkataramana, Alla Ayodhya Rami Reddy and Parimal Nathwani.The 37 MPs elected unopposed have not yet been able to take oath. Though the Rajya Sabha secretariat had picked two sets of dates for the ceremony, several MPs have expressed their inability to travel. The dates for oath ceremony will now be announced afresh, said an official aware of the details.Gujarat-based political commentator Vidyut Joshi said there is nothing wrong with the Election Commission announcing the election schedules in the middle of a pandemic since these are indirect polls that do not involve rallies and campaigns. “All eyes will be on how the BJP manages to win three of the four seats in Gujarat. The calculations favour two seats each to the Congress and the BJP; however since the BJP fielded a Congress rebel Narhari Amin to woo the Patel votes, there will be a keen contest,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/24-rs-seats-to-go-to-polls-on-june-19-ec/story-hnmLbowKUmaPc9j2qBQOJL.html
02-06-2020||India||Unemployment rate in May unchanged at 23.5%: Data||The country’s unemployment rate remained unchanged at 23.5% in May 2020, despite easing of a nationwide lockdown, according to data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE). The number people looking for work has however increased significantly, the CMIE’s survey showed. According to data from CMIE’s website, the rate of unemployment in urban India stood at 25.6%, higher than rural India’s 22.6%.Not surprisingly, the country’s factory output, a key measure of economic activity, shrunk by 16.7%, data from the Central Statistics Office had shown on May 12, signalling that a widespread shutdown hit the economy hard. But according to CMIE’s data, the lockdown’s relaxation seems to have impacted the labour participation rate, which indicates the percentage of all people of working age who are employed or are actively seeking work. “Evidently, people are coming back to the labour markets as the lockdown eases,” CMIE’s Mahesh Vyas said.The labour force participation rate has bounced back up from its lowest level of 35.4% in the week ended April 26. In the next week ended May 3, it stood at 36.2%. It then shot up to 37.6% in the week ended May 10. In the latest week of May 17, it increased to 38.8%, indicating demand for work.In any jobs survey, people with jobs are categorised as employed. People without jobs but looking for work are considered unemployed. However, the labour force participation rate is simply equal to people who are employed plus people who are not employed. In a rough-and-ready sense, the unemployment rate is then simply the number of unemployed divided by the total labour force times 100.According to Vyas, on a weekly basis, the week ended May 24 recorded an unemployment rate of 24.3%. This is a shade higher than the 24.0% unemployment rate recorded in the preceding week. “It appears that the unemployment rate is around the same level as it was in April. It is higher by a whisker. The small relaxations in the lockdown since April 20 have not had any positive impact on the unemployment rate, yet,” Vyas said.According to data sourced from the CMIE’s unemployment tracker, unemployment was highest in Jharkhand at 59.2%, followed by Bihar at 46.2% and Delhi at 44.9%. The rate of joblessness was lowest in Uttarakhand at 8.0%, followed by Assam and Odisha, both at 9.6%.When growth stumbles, vulnerable jobs without safety nets take the first hit. Unemployment then spreads to more secure setors.Job losses in the consumer durables manufacturing sector has been huge, analysts say, leading to de-growth. “Discretionary segments such as household appliances, readymade garments and quick service restaurants (QSRs) will bear the brunt of the pandemic blow and see the steepest revenue declines under both scenarios as stretched working capital cycles will put a squeeze on liquidity and hurt profitability. These segments will also take the longest to recover post-lockdown, with discretionary spending taking up to a year to revive,” said Rahul Prithiani, director Crisil Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unemployment-rate-in-may-unchanged-at-23-5-data/story-8YfiFHljEHvpwwDR0ksU1K.html
02-06-2020||India||Try to keep middle seats empty: DGCA to airlines||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday told commercial airlines to ensure middle seats are kept vacant on flights if the passenger load permits, or provide flyers seated on these seats with additional protective equipment such as wraparound gowns. DGCA said the guidelines on air travel were tweaked based on the recommendations of an experts’ panel the civil aviation ministry constituted on May 26 to review and strengthen public health protocols. “The airlines shall allot the seats in such a manner that the middle seat/seat between two passengers is kept vacant if the passenger load and seat capacity permits the same,” the civil aviation regulator said in its order. It added that members of a family may be allowed to sit together.“If the middle seat is occupied due to passenger load, then additional protective equipment like ‘wraparound gown’ (ministry of textiles approved standards) shall be provided to the individual occupying the intervening seat in addition to the three-layer face mask and face shield,” said the order.The directive came a week after the Supreme Court allowed Air India to keep middle seats occupied till June 6 on its “Vande Bharat” flights for the repatriation of Indians stuck abroad because of the national lockdown, but said that the airline must follow an interim order passed by the Bombay high court in this matter. To be sure, the matter in question was only related to international rescue flights, and the high court’s interim order (to be delivered on June 4, according to the top court), or the Supreme Court’s observations on May 25, were unlikely to have a bearing on domestic flights, which resumed after a two-month break starting on March 25.While commenting on keeping middle seats occupied, the Supreme Court had observed: “How can you say it will not affect anyone? Outside [aircraft], there should be a social distancing of at least six feet. Will the virus know it is in the aircraft and is not supposed to infect?” The reference was to strict social distancing norms in terminals -- during check-in, security check, and boarding.Earlier this month, civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri earlier this month said keeping the middle seats vacant has not been an option for any airline in the world. “Airlines already operate on very thin margins and if you keep one-third of aircraft empty, many of them will choose not to fly. This might be counterproductive. We would need to take other precautions,” he said.Flyers have to be provided safety kits, including three-layered surgical masks, face shields and sanitizers as per the guidelines.“The MHA [ministry of home affairs] guidelines for [Covid-19] lockdown 5.0 announced on May 30 will facilitate the gradual & calibrated reopening of aviation sector. As we move towards critical mass of 50-60 per cent operation of domestic flights, our ability to resume international operations will also improve,” Puri tweeted on Monday.“We are reviewing the order and will incorporate amendments as necessary to our operations to comply with it. We continue to make every effort to ensure the health and safety of our customers and staff,” a spokesperson for Vistara said.IndiGo said it will comply with the order. “We are complying with the DGCA order, by keeping the middle-seat free when load permits. We are also supplying appropriate Personal Protective Equipment to our passengers and crew, to ensure a safe flying experience,” Indigo said.National carrier Air India said it will strictly adhere to all DGCA instructions and guidelines. “Load factors will continue to be soft and hence airlines may on their own maintain flexibility in seat assignments like other airlines around the world are doing,” said Kapil Kaul, CEO, South Asia at aviation consultancy firm CAPA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/try-to-keep-middle-seats-empty-dgca-to-airlines/story-UEviraYNTEogHSY5gpLD9I.html
02-06-2020||India||‘Too busy’: BS Yediyurappa as dissent swirls around in Karnataka unit||Even as the BS Yediyurappa government completes its first year in office next month, several senior leaders and legislators are reportedly unhappy with the chief minister’s style of functioning. The party received a jolt last week after several leaders - majority of them hailing from Northern Karnataka and part of the powerful Lingayat community - met to discuss their unhappiness.Among the key leaders at this luncheon meet were: Umesh Katti, an eight-time legislator and a former minister; Murugesh Nirani, a former minister and an industrialist, Basvraj Patil Yatnal, a former union minister known for his straight-talking ways. Katti and Nirani have been aspirants for a cabinet berth even as Yatnal is eyeing a role either at the Centre or in the state.Even as they publicly swore loyalty to the party and said that they were disciplined soldiers, a crisis has been brewing in the party over several issues. These include rewarding loyalists who feel that those who joined from the Congress-JDS have walked away with plum ministerial berths, perceived interference in the government by Yediyurappa’s family members - especially by his second son Vijayendra, who is the head of the state youth wing - as well as need for a leadership change.Seventy seven-year-old Yediyurappa is an exception at a senior level in the BJP as the party has a national policy of retiring leaders once they cross the 75-year mark. After the by-elections, while the BJP got an absolute majority, the price it paid was rewarding the Congress-JDS legislators who crossed over to help it form government with ministerial berths at the cost of loyalists.Chitradurga MLA and senior BJP legislator GH Thippa Reddy, admitting to the media unhappiness on that front, said “Yes, there is unhappiness in the party about senior leaders being ignored and social justice not being given consideration in the constitution of the cabinet.” Reddy’s angst was directed at legislators who had crossed over from the Congress and the JDS and were made ministers while loyalists who had stood by the party have been ignored.Ramesh Katti, the brother of Umesh Katti, said that he has reminded the chief minister of his promise to send him to the Rajya Sabha after he was denied a ticket in the Lok Sabha polls. Not to be left behind, several other legislators have now publicly thrown their hat into the ministerial ring with some of them, say, Haveri legislator Nehru Olekar publicly saying that they are also aspirants for the same.The other sore point has been what is seen as interference in the administration by BSY’s family members. BY Vijayendra, the politically ambitious younger son of Yediyurappa, had to clarify that he was not an aspirant for an MLC berth, saying “there are several senior people deserving ahead of me”.When queried about the hush-hush meetings of senior legislators, Yediyurappa on Monday tried to display nonchalance, saying, “I am too busy with work regarding development of the state and controlling the Covid-19 pandemic. As a result, I have decided not to worry about such developments and will thus not comment on the (dissidence) issue.”However, a senior minister in the BSY’s cabinet, who did not want to be identified, told HT: “We still have three more years (in power) and high command knows he (Yediyurappa) will be 80 by then and we need to have a replacement. Several of our legislators who have worked for decades in the party have not been rewarded but because of the circumstances those who came from elsewhere have been, this needs to be rectified. Also whoever replaces him needs to be given adequate time to make a mark.”Two of the deputy CM’s Lakshman Savadi and CN Ashwath Narayan also claimed that while there was no dissension in the party, there were some issues which need to be addressed.Congress spokesperson VS Ugrappa said that while they are not concerned about the internal strife within the BJP, but are worried about the impact it is having on the state administration which has almost “come to a standstill”.“Karnataka is facing one of its biggest financial and humanitarian crises and all the ruling party can do is fight amongst itself, which is unfortunate,” said Ugrappa.Senior political analyst Prof Harish Ramaswamy says that it is just a matter of time before Yeddiyurappa is replaced.“While the high command may want somebody like a BL Santhosh (national organisation secretary) or Pralhad Joshi (union minister for parliamentary affairs), the caste matrix amongst the support base of BJP will not permit it. The Lingayat leaders realise that it has to be amongst them which is why somebody like Jagadish Shettar, who is a former CM and a Lingayat, could be a candidate or a Umesh Katti who is also a senior legislator,” said Ramaswamy.Yediyurappa might have been necessary for the BJP if it wanted to come to power, added the professor, but now it may look to replace him and build a long-term younger leadership for the party in the state.“For this they would need to have Yediyurappa and his family agree to the leadership transition as he has shown his power to take away a chunk of the vote when he walked out of the BJP in 2012,” said the political analyst.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-s-unhappiness-karnataka-mla-complains-leaders-ignored-in-bsy-govt/story-R5xZIn5kO00ovQXEYxDUaP.html

The PM also wore it during his address to the nation on the occasion of the Independence Day on August 15, 2019, and several other public events as well, the letter said.The letter cited that the traditional ‘Leirum Phee’ designed as official ‘Lengyan’ (muffler) has cultural, historical, and emotional importance for the people from Manipur. The directorate has started the process of acquiring a geographical indication (GI) tag for ‘phee’, which means cloth in Manipur’s Meitei language, but the Covid-19 outbreak has stalled the process.On Saturday, a video started doing the rounds on social media that purportedly showed the production of ‘Leirum Phee Lengyan’, which was identified as a ‘gamcha’, in a power loom-run textile manufacturing unit in UP’s Barabanki district.Manipuri weavers and locals took exception to the mass production of what they claimed to be a product indigenous to their state and raised concerns about their loss of livelihood because it’s production has been undertaken at an industrial in UP, the country’s most populous state.Several social and civil society organisations, including Ethno Heritage Council, ACOAM-Lup, Kangleipak, Handlooms Promotion Council, Manipur, and All Manipur Ethnical Socio-Cultural Organisation, also urged the state government and the authorities concerned to safeguard the traditional ‘Leirum Lengyan’ and get it registered as intellectual property of Manipur.The production of traditional ‘Leirum Phee’ had started during the reign of the Manipuri king Loyumba in 1074-1112 AD, the letter said.‘Leirum Phee’ is woven on a handloom and used mandatorily during the Meitei community’s wedding ceremonies.The more popular ‘Leirum Phee’ was officially used in the first India ASEAN Motor Car Rally in 2004, the letter said.‘Leirum Phee’ has been used as a symbol in the state on every sociocultural occasion since the 2004 event, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-handloom-authority-urges-textile-ministry-to-stop-production-of-traditional-cloth-in-up/story-RjSN1idswMnWNp9w2WBqGP.html

He said that the scrapping of Article 370 was a bold decision that strengthened the country and realised the “one nation, one constitution,” which many had considered as an impossible task.Similarly, he cited the abolition of Triple Talaq as a laudable move that ensured justice to Muslim women. The decision not to join the “anti-farmer” Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP), a proposed free trade agreement in the Asia-Pacific region, was another such case in the point, the BJP chief said.Nadda accepted that the Covid-19 is an unimaginable crisis and there are no ready solutions to the pandemic.“However, the country stands with Modiji,” he added.He said the party would continue to move ahead with a progressive approach.Nadda hit back at Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s criticism of the government’s inept handling of the viral outbreak and the migrant workers’ travails of returning to their native places amid the lockdown restrictions.The BJP president alleged that Gandhi did not display an “in-depth understanding” of these critical issues.“His statements smacked of bad politics,” he alleged.He also blamed the Congress for its “delaying tactics” on a resolution of the Ayodhya dispute and credited the government for its bid to construct a “grand Ram temple” under PM Modi’s leadership.Nadda said that the party is working towards launching a digital campaign, as the conventional poll campaign has to be dispensed with because of strict adherence to social distancing norms due to the viral outbreak.He announced that the party would hold digital rallies across the country to mark the first anniversary of the Modi government 2.0.On social media, the BJP posted videos claiming “bade faisle, kam hue fassle” (big decisions, bridging distances) is the hallmark of its rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unimaginable-challenges-and-bold-accomplishments-bjp-chief-jp-nadda-lauds-one-year-of-modi-2-0/story-asgs3tl0gDOuYXjJUpALLI.html
