25-06-2020||India||Fresh charge sheet against Rana Kapoor and DHFL’s Wadhawans||New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Thursday filed a charge sheet against Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor, his daughter Roshni Kapoor, and the promoters of Dewan Housing Finance Limited (DHFL) Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan, alleging that the Kapoors and the Wadhawans conspired to siphon off public money and benefit themselves, two officers familiar with the development said.The charge sheet comes just before the 60-day filing deadline from the date of arrest was to end. The Wadhawans were arrested by CBI on April 26 from a Mahabaleshwar government facility, after it was found that they had slipped out of Mumbai quietly with their family during the lockdown. They have already been questioned and are currently lodged in a jail in Mumbai.A senior CBI officer cited above said they will soon arrest Rana Kapoor and interrogate him. The agency’s first charge sheet, the two officials said, focuses on an alleged criminal conspiracy by Rana Kapoor in the investment of Rs 3,700 crore by Yes Bank in short term debentures of DHFL between April and June 2018, for which Kapil Wadhawan allegedly paid a kickback of Rs 600 to the Kapoor family in the garb of a loan of Rs 600 crore. According to the agency, the money was given by Wadhawan to M/s DOIT Urban Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises, in which Roshni Kapoor is a director.This money, the second officer said, was given on the basis of a mortgage of a property that has a much lower marker value by considering its future conversion from agricultural land to the residential land. DHFL never repaid the bank’s Rs 3,700 crore investment, and neither did the bank ask for it, the agency said in its charge sheet.Subsequently, Yes Bank also sanctioned a loan of Rs 750 crore to RKW Developers Pvt Ltd – a company belonging to Dheeraj Wadhawan for their Bandra reclamation project. The money reached the parent company DHFL without any investment in the said project, the officer added.CBI suspects that over 100 shell companies were used by the Kapoor family for diverting money, the first officer said. He added that this may be the first of the many charge sheets which will be filed in the case.Kapoor’s lawyer Subhash Jadhav and the Wadhawans’ lawyer Amit Desai declined to comment.Rana Kapoor has also been charged by the Enforcement Directorate for money laundering.While filing its charge sheet on May 6, ED said that Rana Kapoor used the Yes Bank as his “personal fiefdom” to carry out alleged illegal activities and was the architect of a financial fraud to create wealth for himself and his family. The 62-year-old former banker was accused of “impropriety, illegality and rampant misuse of power” by ED.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-charge-sheet-against-rana-kapoor-and-dhfl-s-wadhawans/story-BZmDxaOGd6h9n5RivYVJAO.html

There were five more casualties taking the total death toll to 230. The government had stepped up the rate of testing over the past week following criticism from all sides and a reprimand from the state high court over low testing in the state for a long time.From less than 300 tests a day last month, the number of tests went up to 36,000 on June 16. Subsequently, an average of 2,500 to 3,000 tests were conducted in the last one week. On Thursday alone, 3,616 tests were conducted taking the cumulative number tests to 70,934.However, the 10 government labs and 18 private labs which were newly permitted, have not been able to handle the number of samples arriving in them. By Thursday, as many as 8,235 samples were still pending in the labs for testing and the authorities said collection of more samples without testing the pending ones will create problems.Director of public health and family welfare G Srinivasa Rao said collection of samples by conducting special camps has been stopped for two days so that the testing of pending samples was completed and labs and collections centres are sanitized.The official said in a statement that each sample has to be tested within 48 hours and till then it has to be preserved in controlled temperature. “If there is delay in testing the samples, it may show false positive results,” he said.The director, however, said collection of samples through special camps was paused but tests in hospitals would continue uninterrupted. Those with suspected symptoms of Covid-19 can get themselves tested in hospitals.Meanwhile, following an alarming rise in the number of positive cases for Covid-19 in Greater Hyderabad, which accounted for 70 per cent of the total cases in the state, several business houses announced voluntary lockdown for a period ranging from seven to 10 days as a precautionary measure.On Thursday, many shops at the Pathergatti business hub were closed as local traders decided not to open their shops for the next few days. “As the number of Covid-19 cases has been going up sharply, we had no other option but to close down our business activities,” Abid Moinuddin, president, Pathergatti Traders Association said.More shopkeepers declared that they would not open their shops for at least one week. The Lad Bazaar Bangle Market Association also decided to close down their shops for a week from Friday onwards.The Hyderabad Kirana Merchants Association and textile traders of famous General Bazar in Secunderabad also announced closure of shops till July 3, while Hyderabad and Secunderabad sanitaryware merchants announced closure up to July 5 and troop bazar merchants in Abids up to July 8 ..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-stops-covid-19-tests-for-two-days-as-samples-deluge-labs/story-VFtqRD0HHoAFg8iOy7SYvM.html

The labs are at KIMS, SUM, Apollo Hospital and KIIT-TBI in Bhubaneswar.Covid-19 tests in government labs, most of which are attached with hospitals are free.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.“We expect the number of tests to go up after reduction in the price. People who can afford the cost can now visit any of these labs and get tested,” said Mohapatra.On Friday, the Congress and 13 other parties are scheduled to stage a demonstration in Bhubaneswar over declining Covid tests in the state.“In April, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had announced that 15,000 samples will be tested every day but the number of tests being done does not cross 4,000 per day,” alleged PCC chief Niranjan Patnaik. He also alleged that all migrants returning to the state are not being tested before they are sent to their homes.The ruling BJD has rubbished the opposition’s charge. Government chief whip Pramila Mallick said that when the country is limping back to normalcy and witnessing a “steep growth in Covid-19 recovery rate, Congress and Left parties are trying to mislead people by creating panic.”Health and family welfare department officials said a serological survey to gauge the spread of infection will begin in Puri on Saturday with people undergoing rapid antibody tests. The rapid antibody test will be conducted in Ganjam, Gajapati districts, Bhubaneswar and Badamba-Narsinghpur area in Cuttack district from the first week of July.

25-06-2020||India||Pakistan involved in efforts to illegally acquire nuclear tech from Germany: Official report||Pakistan and North Korea continue to be involved in attempts to illegally obtain nuclear products and know-how from German hi-tech companies as part of efforts to develop their atomic weapons programmes, a new report by German authorities has said.The annual report from the Office for the Protection of the Constitution in Baden-Württemberg, a state in southwest Germany, said the country is an “important area of operation” for clandestine efforts by Pakistan, North Korea, Iran and Syria to obtain nuclear technology as it is a leading industrial nation and home to numerous hi-tech firms.The report for the year 2019 was made public by authorities in Baden-Württemberg on June 16. This is the second time in less than six months that German authorities have expressed concern about Pakistan’s efforts to illegally procure technology used in atomic weapons.The report, which is in German, said: “Iran, Pakistan, North Korea and Syria are still pursuing such efforts. They aim to complete existing arsenals, perfect the range, deployability and effectiveness of their weapons, and develop new weapons systems. They are trying to obtain the necessary products and relevant know-how...through illegal procurement efforts in Germany.”Such countries also “constantly develop and optimise their procurement methods” to circumvent existing export restrictions and embargoes, the report said.“To conceal the actual end user, they can procure goods in Germany and Europe with the help of specially established cover companies and, in particular, transport dual-use goods to risk states. Typical bypass countries include the United Arab Emirates, Turkey and China,” the report added.Potential sources of nuclear know-how are universities, non-university research institutions and research and training departments of companies, the report said.“In order to minimise risks, the State Office for the Protection of the Constitution sensitises those responsible to make them aware of the danger and possible consequences of illegal knowledge transfer,” it added.In a specific section on Pakistan, the report said the country has operated an extensive programme for nuclear weapons and delivery systems for many years. “This is primarily directed against the ‘arch enemy’ India, which also possesses nuclear weapons. For maintenance and further development, Pakistan is dependent, among other things, on the acquisition of Western technology and procedures,” the report said.“In addition to the acquisition of products (dual-use goods), the secondment of scientists to universities, institutes or research establishments is also important. This also applies to institutions in Baden-Württemberg.”In November last year, the German government had responded to a question from several lawmakers of die Linke (Left Party) by saying it believed there has been a “sharp increase” in Pakistan’s activities in recent years to illegally procure technology used in nuclear, biological and chemical (NBC) weapons.The government’s reply dovetailed with concerns expressed by Bundesamt für Verfassungsschutz (BfV), the domestic intelligence service, which had said in a 2018 report on proliferation-related matters that there has been a “massive increase” in Pakistan’s attempts to clandestinely procure nuclear goods in Germany and other Western countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-involved-in-efforts-to-illegally-acquire-nuclear-tech-from-germany-official-report/story-IYmWCqpkgBknPXmNfkTrNL.html
25-06-2020||India||Pak high commission officials were recruiting Kashmiri youth for terror: Official||Sustained efforts by officials of the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi to allegedly recruit young men from Kashmir for terrorist training was one of the factors behind India’s decision to halve the strength of the mission, people familiar with developments said on Thursday.Reports from intelligence agencies show that 399 young men from Jammu and Kashmir had been issued visas by the Pakistan high commission since January 2017, and the current whereabouts of 218 of them are unknown, the people said on condition of anonymity.India asked Pakistan on June 23 to reduce the strength of its mission in New Delhi by 50% in a week, saying the actions of Pakistani officials were part of a “larger policy of supporting cross-border violence and terrorism”.Pakistan rejected and condemned what it said were “baseless Indian allegations” and informed New Delhi of its decision to reduce the Indian high commission’s strength within seven days as a reciprocal measure.The people cited above said intelligence reports had shown that Pakistan has been targeting young men from Kashmir for terrorist training, and equipping and arming them to carry out attacks similar to the one in Pulwama in February 2019.“The officials of the Pakistan high commission were involved in these efforts to foment trouble in Jammu and Kashmir. Such attacks are used by Pakistan to project internationally as the work of local resistance fighters,” said a person.Citing one specific instance, the people said five heavily armed terrorists of the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) were tracked and killed by security forces on April 5 after they infiltrated into Keran sector of Jammu and Kashmir from Dudhnial in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir on the night of March 31-April 1.Three of the five terrorists were identified as Adil Hussain Mir, Umar Nazir Khan and Sajjad Ahmed Hurrah, all residents of Jammu and Kashmir who had travelled to Pakistan in April 2018 on visas issued by the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi, the people said.Indian security agencies have uncovered other instances of Pakistani officials in New Delhi being allegedly linked to terror activities. While investigating the case of Jammu and Kashmir Police’s deputy superintendent Davinder Singh, who was caught with two Hizbul Mujahideen commanders on January 10, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) found that all three were in “constant touch” with an assistant in the Pakistani mission named Shafqat, the people said. Shafqat, they added, was allegedly a conduit for hawala transactions and terror financing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-officials-in-new-delhi-recruiting-kashmiri-youth-for-terror-official/story-acHZIIfBIvBoYRAU6oreYN.html

25-06-2020||India||US shifting military to face Chinese threat to India and Southeast Asia: Mike Pompeo||The Chinese threat to India and Southeast Asia is one of the reasons the United States is reducing its troop presence in Europe, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said on Thursday in response to a question at the Brussels Forum virtual conference.Pompeo was asked why the US had reduced the number of troops it has based in Germany. The US Secretary of State said that if US troops were no longer there, it was because they were being moved to face other places. The actions of the Chinese Communist Party meant there were “threats to India” and countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and the South China Sea. The US military is “postured appropriately” to meet these “challenges of our time”, he said.Also Read: India should assess China’s actions, not words | HT EditorialPompeo noted that the Trump administration had carried out a long overdue strategic posture review of the US military two years ago. The US had carried out a fundamental relook at the threats it faced and how it should allocate its resources, including intelligence and military and cyber.As part of this exercise, Pompeo said it was felt that the capacity to deter Russia or other adversaries wasn’t determined any longer “by having a bunch of folks garrisoned some place”.“So we really went back to fundamentally relook at what is the nature of the conflict, what is the nature of the threat and how should we allocate our resources. Whether that is our resources in the intelligence community, our resources in the air force, the marines. our broad set of allocations of the security apparatus,” he said.“The decision that the President made with respect to Germany is an outcome of a collective set of decisions about how we are going to posture our resources around the world,” he said, pointing that this would imply that there would be fewer American resources in some places.“There will be other places - I just talked about the threat from the Chinese Communist Party - ... threats to India, threats to Vietnam, threats to Malaysia, Indonesia, South China Sea challenges, the Philippines. We are going to make sure we are postured appropriately to counter the PLA (People’s Liberation Army). We think that is the challenge of our time and we are going to make sure we have resources in place to do that,” he said.Earlier, he announced the formation of a US-European dialogue on China so that the Atlantic alliance could have a “common understanding of the threat posed by China”. Pompeo said the two sides needed “a collective data set” on China’s action so the two could take action together.Also Read: India must build stronger deterrence to deal with China’s Xi Jinping | OpinionSpeaking about the Chinese threat, he cited the “bloody border confrontation with India,” Beijing’s South China Sea activity and its predatory economic policies as evidence.Asked whether Huawei was part of the Chinese “surveillance state,” Pompeo said Chinese security force personnel worked on the top floor of the company headquarters and Chinese law required Huawei to pass any data, including personal data, to the Chinese Communist Party whenever the latter asked. He said there was more evidence that he could not state in public.The day before the US foreign minister had tweeted: “The tide is turning toward trusted 5G vendors and away from Huawei. The world’s leading telecom companies-Telefonica, Orange, Jio, Telstra, and many more-are becoming ‘Clean Telcos.’ They are rejecting doing business with tools of the CCP surveillance state, like Huawei.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-shifting-military-to-face-chinese-threat-to-india-and-south-east-asia-pompeo/story-9zqoaeuFQVwA8wbUQMVXjI.html

People-to-people linkages and trade and economic cooperation, especially in technology and innovation sectors, are an important dimension of the US-India partnership,” he added.Srivastava pointed out high-skilled Indian professionals “bring important skill sets, bridge technological gaps and impart a competitive edge to the US economy”.He added, “They have also been a critical component of the workforce that is at the forefront of providing Covid-19-related assistance in key sectors, including health, information technology and financial services.”Indians currently account for more than 70% of the 85,000 H-1B visas given out every year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-hopeful-professionals-will-continue-to-be-welcomed-in-us-mea/story-Uw5H6Dh6Cr1yBP2juAeNRO.html

All four are likely to be re-inducted as ministers soon.“A delegation of National People’s Party led by Conrad Sangma along with Himanta Biswa Sarma called on me and all the 4 MLAs gave their letter of support to the BJP led government in the state of Manipur,” Heptulla tweeted after meeting the NPP legislators.The development comes a day after the four MLAs, who had left Imphal on Tuesday, met Union home minister Amit Shah and BJP president JP Nadda in New Delhi. They were accompanied by NPP national president and Meghalaya Chief Minister Conrad Sangma and senior Assam minister and convener of North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) Himanta Biswa Sarma.“Both leaders gave us a very patient hearing and all issues which were there we expressed them all in detail to them. They have understood what the problem is and have assured that all issues will be addressed and taken care of,” Sangma told journalists earlier on Thursday on arrival at the Imphal airport.“That is why after assurance given by Mr Shah and Mr Nadda we have decided that we will be withdrawing our resignations and NPP will continue to support the BJP government.”The three-year-old BJP-led coalition had run into a crisis on June 17 when three BJP MLAs resigned from the party and six other legislators - four from the NPP, one from Trinamool Congress and one Independent - withdrew support to the N Biren Singh’s government.Citing differences with Singh’s style of functioning, the NPP MLAs as well as the TMC and Independent legislators joined hands with opposition Congress and formed a Secular Progressive Front (SPF) to oust the government.Citing that the government has become a minority, the SPF leaders met the Governor twice seeking convening of a special assembly session to hold floor test on the government’s majority.Despite the numbers not being in their favour, the BJP candidate, Manipur’s titular king Sanajaoba Leishemba won the Rajya Sabha election on July 19 securing 28 votes to Congress candidate T Mangibabu’s 24.While these developments were underway, a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team questioned Congress leader and former chief minister O Ibobi Singh in Imphal on Wednesday in connection with a case of alleged misappropriation of funds.It is alleged that the former CM while he was chairman of Manipur Development Society (MDS) between June, 2009 and July, 2017 misappropriated government funds worth Rs 332 crores along with others.“The only way for BJP to be in power in Manipur is by using CBI against Congress MLAs, manoeuvring Raj Bhawan to slow down attempts by Congress to form government along with allies and by giving pressure to Manipur MLAs by calling them to Delhi,” Manipur Congress spokesperson Nignombam Bupenda Meitei said.“The entire machineries have been abused to stop the floor test. This is BJP’s destruction of the Constitution,” he added. Despite winning 21 seats to Congress’s 28, BJP had been able to form government in Manipur in 2017 with support of four NPP MLAs, four Naga Peoples Front MLAs and one MLA each from TMC, Lok Janshakti Party and an Independent in the 60 -ember House.Due to disqualification of four MLAs by the Speaker, resignations by three BJP MLAs and resignation by a turncoat Congress MLA in March, the Manipur assembly’s strength has been reduced to 52.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-led-govt-in-manipur-back-in-saddle-as-4-npp-mlas-withdraw-resignations/story-1jks8EV9zXKQ3b768GHR8K.html

In the process, it will also become the first state to attempt such a thing. Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel, addressing a press conference, said that the scheme will be launched on the occasion of ‘Hareli’, a local festival.The rate of cow dung, the CM said, would be fixed in the next eight days and for that a five-member ministerial committee has been constituted under the chairmanship of agriculture and water resources minister Ravindra Chaubey.“There has been a tradition of open grazing in the state of Chhattisgarh, which results in loss of crops ... The stray cattle in cities cause road accidents, loss of life and property. Second, the cows are abandoned after they stop giving milk and hence to make cow rearing a profitable business, the government has decided to procure cow dung from farmers and cattle owners,” said the CM.The urban administration department has been directed to make complete arrangements to prevent stray animals roaming in the cities. The department will be responsible for purchasing cow dung and production of vermicompost.“The purpose of this scheme is to promote cattle rearing in the state and to benefit the cattle owners, who are mostly farmers. The government tried to strengthen the rural economy of the state through the ‘Narva, Garuva, Ghuruwa, Badi’ scheme in which we have developed cowsheds in 2,200 villages of the state. In the next two-three months, about 5,000 more cowsheds will be developed in the state. This scheme is an incremental step forward,” said the CM.A committee of IAS officers has also been constituted under the chairmanship of the chief secretary to determine the process of procurement of cow dung.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-to-buy-cow-dung-from-farmers-5-member-team-to-decide-rates/story-KoLohaiQymtUXkbdD0TooJ.html

25-06-2020||India||Imran Khan calls Osama Bin Laden a ‘shaheed’ in parliament, gets hammered||Just a day after the United States called out Pakistan as one of the “safe havens”, Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday called al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden a ‘shaheed’ or martyr. PM Khan was speaking in the national assembly, elaborating how Pakistan has been humiliated across the world despite having sacrificed lives in the war against terrorism.“The way we helped America in the ‘war on terror’ and the humiliation that my country had to face. I don’t think there has ever been any other country that supported war on terror and had to face criticism from them. If they are not successful in Afghanistan, Pakistan is held responsible for that too. Openly,” PM Khan told the National Assembly in a widely-circulated video.WATCH | Osama bin Laden a martyr: Pak PM Imran Khan while criticising USAImran Khan, who had described his foreign policy as his government’s biggest achievement, then went on to relate two instances when he said, people of Pakistan were deeply embarrassed.“One was when Americans killed Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad. Shaheed kar diya (was martyred). But what happened after that. The entire world hurled abuses at us. Our ally (US) entered our country and killed someone without even telling us. It was a big humiliation,” Khan said, before going on to describe the drone attacks on Pakistan as the second set of incidents that embarrassed the country.Osama bin Laden was killed in a military operation by US Navy Seals in 2011 at the Garrison town in Abbottabad.Imran Khan’s description of Osama bin Laden as a ‘shaheed‘set social media abuzz as soon as a video of his remarks got out.Imran Khan was immediately panned by the opposition leaders from the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz and Pakistan Peoples Party.“Remember that Osama Bin Laden can be the PM’s hero but not the nation’s. He was and will remain a criminal of the state and the people,” PPP’s Senator Sherry Rehman said, adding that Imran Khan’s words will go down in history.PML-N senior leader Khawaja Asif also panned Imran Khan. According to a report in Dawn, Asif said Osama bin Laden “brought terrorism to our lands, he was a terrorist through and through and he [PM Khan] calls him shaheed?”There has been no clarification from Imran Khan, who has been seen to defend Osama bin Laden in the past. Like when he was reported to have argued that one person’s freedom fighter could be another’s terrorist. Indian diplomat Vidisha Maitra had pointed to such statements from PM Khan in the United Nations General Assembly when she took the prime minister to the cleaners. Putting the spotlight on Pakistan’s track record of supporting and creating terrorists, she asked PM Khan if he would deny that “he was an open defender of Osama bin Laden”.Khan has made repeated controversial statements over the years, including during a trip to the US in 2019 when he claimed the ISI provided Washington with a lead that helped them find and kill bin Laden, according to news agency AFP. The cricketer-turned premier has long been criticised by opponents for overly sympathising with militants, with rivals once dubbing him “Taliban Khan”.Imran Khan’s remarks on Thursday came just a day after the United States State Department called out Pakistan for its continuing support to terrorists targeting India and Afghanistan.In its report that classified Pakistan as a safe haven for terrorists, the state department underlined that Jaish-e-Mohammad founder Masood Azhar and 2008 Mumbai terror attacks mastermind Sajid Mir were “widely believed” to be living “under the protection of the state” in Pakistan. The report had mirrored concerns expressed by New Delhi on numerous occasions about Pakistan’s complicity in sponsoring, promoting or supporting terrorists operating from its territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/imran-khan-calls-osama-bin-laden-a-shaheed-in-parliament-gets-hammered/story-NPqnKnuxukaHmSgFp5q8rN.html

On Thursday, he added that all the processes for obtaining the license were followed.“We have not done anything wrong while obtaining the licence. We did not advertise the medicine (Coronil), we just tried to tell people about the effects of the medicine,” Balkrishna said.Ramdev had said the medicines were developed by Patanjali Research Center, Haridwar in association with privately-owned National Institute of Medical Science, Jaipur.The Uttarakhand government has also submitted some documents pertaining to necessary clearances and license to Patanjali to the Centre.Uttarakhand’s Ayurved department’s licence officer Y S Rawat said the notice is being issued to the firm to explain from where it got the permission to launch a “corona kit” as a cure for the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-result-is-before-people-patanjali-s-fresh-defence-of-coronil-after-states-slap-ban/story-nCnCRDWpVYVw8C1T9nieZP.html

An overwhelming 83% of the respondents said they wouldn’t travel by air if it involves a mandatory 14-day quarantine period.“There is a need for better travel insurance in a bid to regain passengers’ confidence,” Khosla added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-50-of-passengers-want-to-wait-for-at-least-6-months-before-they-travel-by-air-again-iata-survey/story-ceeNpNQT5bWCCcgOeueouN.html

It will be the first major agitation to be led by Kavitha, after her defeat in the Lok Sabha elections in 2019.Kavitha, who is the former honorary president of TGBKS strongly opposed the Centre’s decision to privatise Singareni Collieries, which is one of the profit-making public sector undertakings.She called upon the coal mine workers to burn effigies of the Central government at all the Singareni coal mines on Friday. “The coal mine workers will participate in the 24-hour strike on June 2, to highlight the issue and attract the nation’s attention,” she said in a statement.Apart from TGBKS, all other national trade unions of Singareni Collieries have announced a three-day strike from July 2 to 4 in protest against the privatisation.Representatives of the All India Trade Union Congress, Indian National Trade Union Congress, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Hindustan Mazdoor Sangh, the Confederation of Indian Trade Unions, who had a meeting in Godavarikhani last week gave a notice of the upcoming strike to the management.The trade union leaders demanded that the Centre withdraw its proposal to privatise coal mines and e-auction of 50 blocks of coal mines in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kcr-s-daughter-kavitha-to-lead-protests-by-singareni-coal-mine-workers-tomorrow/story-OVbYVANn0gf7wHRgSsec2M.html

The SOPs say that expatriates will have to follow the SOPs being implemented in those countries. Kerala government’s guidelines are impractical for the MEA to implement,” minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said according to ANI.At least 149 Vande Bharat and 171 chartered flights are expected to land in Kerala with expatriates in next two weeks.“Kerala government has issued some special guidelines for the expatriates who want to return to Kerala from Gulf countries. Regarding this, MEA has informed the government that state-specific protocols cannot be implemented,” the minister said.The Kerala government which had earlier said that expatriates should have Covid-free certificates before flying home, scrapped that demand on Wednesday after the Centre said tests are not feasible in Indian missions but insisted that passengers will have to wear PPE during the flights.The state government had maintained that Covid-free certificates were a must because most of Kerala’s coronavirus cases were people who had come from abroad or other states.The state’s insistence on Covid-free certificates had drawn fire from the opposition and the expatriates as insensitive||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-s-guidelines-for-expats-return-impractical-says-mea/story-vCbBvpKLbc3mtIBRTCSjyL.html
25-06-2020||India||CBI chargesheets Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor, daughter and DHFL promoters for fraud||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), on Thursday, filed a chargesheet in the case against Yes Bank founder Rana Kapoor and the promoters of Dewan Housing Finance Ltd (DHFL) Kapil and Dheeraj Wadhawan. The former Yes Bank chief’s daughter Roshni Kapoor has also been named in the chargesheet.Earlier in the first week of March, a case was registered against Rana Kapoor and the Wadhawans in connection with the Yes Bank fraud. Wadhawan was arrested during the lockdown after he managed to reach his farmhouse outside Mumbai. The case was in connection with suspicious loans sanctioned by Yes Bank and alleged quid pro quo kickbacks received by Kapoor and his family from DHFL’s Wadhawans.The chargesheet also mentions DOiT Urban Ventures Ltd (DUVPL), owned by Kapoor’s daughters, while DHFL has been named as an accused in the Yes Bank scam.It has been alleged that between April and June, 2018, Yes Bank invested Rs 3,700 crore in short-term debentures of DHFL. “Simultaneously, Kapil Wadhawan paid a kickback of Rs 600 crore to Rana Kapoor and his family members in the garb of a builder loan of Rs 600 crore given by DHFL to M/s DOIT Urban Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary of RAB Enterprises in which Bindu Kapoor is a director and 100% shareholder. Furthermore, the daughters of Rana Kapoor are 100% shareholders of DOIT through Morgon Credits,” states CBI’s FIR in the case. CBI further alleged that DHFL gave Rs 600 crore to DOIT on the basis of a mortgage of a sub-standard property having very meager value and by considering the future conversion from agricultural land to the residential land. DHFL had not repaid the bank’s Rs 3,700 crore till date, it adds.Yes Bank also sanctioned a loan of Rs 750 crore to RKW Developers Pvt Ltd whose Director is Dheeraj Wadhawan and is a DHFL group company for their Bandra reclamation project. The amount was transferred by RKW Developers to DHFL without investing anything in the project for which it was sanctioned, the CBI FIR further states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-chargesheets-yes-bank-founder-rana-kapoor-daughter-and-dhfl-promoters-for-fraud/story-GPSiCDTJGrw4xEahM9sacO.html

She added that her party staged successful protests on the matter in Uttar Pradesh today.“The government, by hiking the prices of Diesel and Petrol for the 19th continuous day today, has made this clear that the BJP has greater interest in picking people’s pockets even in the times of a crisis. The Congress party staged protests in all of UP today. The people are not willing to put up with this loot any longer,” she tweeted on Thursday afternoon.Petrol price in Delhi was hiked to Rs 79.92 per litre from Rs 79.76 during the day while diesel rates were increased to Rs 80.02 a litre from Rs 79.88. The diesel price were increased for the 19th day in a row since the price revisions began on June 7 after a gap of close to three months due to the lockdownAlso Read: Another hike in fuel prices, diesel crosses Rs 80 a litre mark in DelhiThe Congress has launched nationwide agitation on the issue, with its state units leading protests on the issue in their respective regions.Earlier today, UP Congress president Ajay Kumar Lallu and several other party activists were arrested while protesting in Lucknow, said PTI. Congress workers had started their protest from the party headquarters in Lucknow and were going towards the Vidhan Sabha when they were stopped by the cops, the agency said.Priynaka is the party general secretary in charge of eastern UP and has been leading the party’s drive to oppose the government on the issue of fuel price hike.“ The government has created history by picking people’s pockets in the times of crisis. Diesel prices have now crossed the price of petrol. When the prices of crude oil are sliding across the world, look at this method of looting people. The government raises the price of petrol and diesel by a few paise every day so that they avoid the impression of a rise in prices by Rs 8 a litre or Rs 9 a litre in one go,” she had said in another tweet 24 hours ago.Congress has organized protests in several states over the issue. In Madhya Pradesh, senior party leader Digvijaya Singh was booked along with other party workers for taking out a cycle march to protest on the issue.Also Read: FIR against Digvijaya Singh, 150 Congress workers for cycle march against fuel price hikeIn Haryana, former chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda slammed the centre alleging the rising fuel prices were bound to have a cascading effect and burden common people and farmers the most due to their dependence on diesel for irrigation and transport.In Bihar, opposition leader Sharad Yadav said that the double whammy of fuel price rise along with Coved pandemic will result in setbacks for the BJP in the coming Bihar elections, reported PTI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/picking-pocket-during-crisis-priyanka-gandhi-vadra-attacks-centre-over-fuel-price-hike/story-lT04vdXE2Hilo2UmVfEd8N.html
25-06-2020||India||Assam fire: NGT imposes interim fine of Rs 25 crore on OIL, forms committee||The National Green Tribunal (NGT) has ordered the formation of an expert committee to probe the blowout and the subsequent fire of a natural gas well operated by Oil India Limited (OIL) in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district and the damage caused to human life, wildlife, and the environment because of the industrial disaster.Acting on two different cases filed in the matter, the NGT in an order passed via video-conference because of the restrictions imposed due to the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak on Wednesday also directed OIL to deposit an initial amount of Rs 25 crore to the Tinsukia district administration for the damage caused by the blowout on May 27 and the subsequent fire on June 9.The gas well located at Baghjan had a blowout --- an uncontrolled release of gas and oil condensate --- on May 27 and it caught fire on June 9, which killed two firefighters and over 1,600 families, who were living close to the site of the industrial disaster, were displaced.The eight-member expert committee will be headed by retired Justice BP Katakey of Gauhati high court and will have members from the Central Pollution Control Board (CBCB), the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and also the district magistrate (DM) of Tinsukia.The committee has been entrusted with the responsibility to probe cause of the blowout, the extent of loss and damage caused to human life, wildlife, and environment, damage and the health hazards caused to the public and whether any contamination of the air, water, and soil of the area close to the gas well has taken place.It will investigate contamination of water in the nearby Dibru river, impact on Dibru-Saikhowa National Park (DSNP) and Maguri Motapung wetland, determine people responsible for the fire, assessment of compensation to those affected and preventive, and also suggest preventive measures.The tribunal directed the committee to submit its preliminary report “as expeditiously as possible and not later than 30 days” from the date of issue of the order.The next date for the hearing has been fixed on July 29.“In view of the prima facie case made out against OIL on the extent of damage caused to the environment and biodiversity, damage to both human and wildlife, public health and having regard to the financial worth of the company and the extent of damage, we direct OIL to deposit an initial amount of Rs 25 crore with the district collector of Tinsukia and shall abide by further orders of the tribunal,” the order stated.The blowout and fire destroyed nearly 30 houses, covered houses, trees and water bodies in the area close to the well, which is barely 500 metres from Maguri Motapung wetland, an eco-sensitive habitat for rare species of birds, and about a kilometre from DSNP.Efforts to control the fire and plug the blowout, which are expected to take a month, are underway. But, incessant rainfall in the area since Monday and the collapse of a bridge on Wednesday on the main route leading to the gas well have hampered work and transportation of both men and materials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-fire-ngt-imposes-interim-fine-of-rs-25-crore-on-oil-forms-committee/story-gifpZon4vLps2VAzU0UC2O.html

This is not in accordance with the provisions of our various bilateral agreements, especially the key 1993 Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas.”This agreement states each side will keep its military forces in areas along the LAC to a “minimum level compatible with friendly and good neighbourly relations”. Following the Chinese build-up, India had to make “counter deployments and the resulting tension has thereafter expressed itself”.New Delhi reiterated that it has been patrolling in Galwan Valley for a long time, and has never attempted to change the status quo. However, it added the same has not been reciprocated by the Chinese side.Both sides had developed patterns of patrolling over many years and it is the “reasonable expectation that patrols will not be obstructed in the discharge of their legitimate duties”. However, the Indian side has experienced obstruction to patrolling that is often accompanied by efforts to unilaterally change the status quo along the LAC.Indian troops are fully familiar with the LAC’s alignment in all sectors and abide scrupulously by it. They have also patrolled all along the LAC, including in Galwan Valley, “for a long time”, the statement said.Yesterday, China, for the first time, admitted casualties on its side in the violent brawl with Indian soldiers, but claimed that “numbers were not very high”. On the other hand, 20 Indian soldiers died defending their country on June 15.On Tuesday, Zhao Lijian, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, had dismissed as “fake news” a statement by minister VK Singh that the PLA could have suffered double the number of casualties compared to the Indian army.China on Wednesday launched a twin diplomatic attack against India with its foreign and defence ministries blaming New Delhi for the Galwan Valley clash and alleging that the external affairs ministry and Indian media were spreading false information about the incident.On June 20, India, for the second time, rejected China’s claim on Galwan Valley in Ladakh and reiterated that the violent clash of June 15 was triggered by Chinese efforts to build structures on the Indian side of the LAC. The MEA spoksperson had said the position with regard to Galwan Valley was “historically clear”. He added, “Attempts by the Chinese side to now advance exaggerated and untenable claims with regard to Line of Actual Control (LAC) there are not acceptable. They are not in accordance with China’s own position in the past.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-amassing-troops-along-lac-since-may-its-conduct-in-disregard-of-all-norms-says-external-affairs-ministry/story-wZCi4M558ZeAutP8m7ERpJ.html
25-06-2020||India||Delhi L-G reverses Covid order on home isolation after meeting CM Kejriwal||The Anil Baijal-led Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Thursday agreed to reverse his order that mandated all Covid-19 patients visit state-run Covid facilities for an evaluation. Baijal made the announcement on Twitter over the controversial rule that has drawn widespread criticism from the public and the Arvind Kejriwal government.In two tweets, Baijal’s office said only Covid patients who do not have adequate facilities at home to ensure physical segregation and do not have other medical conditions would be shifted to Covid Care centres and other facilities.Also Read: Only small fraction of patients reaching Covid centres in Delhi for screeningRaj Niwas said the disaster management authority, which is empowered to notify Covid-19 rules for national capital Delhi, had agreed to modify the standard operating procedure to meet the twin objectives of “containment of local spread & provision of timely medical care for Covid positive cases”.The decision was taken at the meeting of the state disaster management authority (SDMA) headed by the Lt Governor. Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has been a vocal critic of the June 20 order, is the vice chairperson.Now mild and asymptomatic people in Delhi will not have to queue up at Covid Care Centres, or CCC, for their clinical assessment.“Yes, the L-G has agreed to revert to the old system where a team led by the district surveillance officer (DSO) will visit the house of the Covid positive patient to decide whether home isolation can be recommended,” Sisodia told Hindustan Times before heading into a Press conference to make the formal announcement.In a statement, the L-G office also clarified about the process of assessment. “It was decided that all cases who test positive by Rapid test for COVID-19 antigen will be examined by the Medical Officer on duty at the testing site to assess the severity of illness i.e. pre- symptomatic/asymptomatic/mild/moderate or severe. The assessment made by the Medical Officer on site shall effectively constitute an assessment made at the COVID Care Centre,” the statement read.For those who test positive through RT-PCR Test, the patient shall be allowed home isolation if, as per the assessment of Home Isolation team sent by the District Surveillance Officer (DSO), the patient is mild/pre-symptomatic/asymptomatic and has a residence of two rooms or a separate room and a separate toilet for the patient. He/she will be provided a contact number for any consultation required by him along with details of CATS Ambulance call number for transfer to hospital in case symptoms develop, the L-G’s office said.“If the said patient has moderate/severe symptoms with co-morbidities, he shall be transferred to the CCC/CHC/Hospital. In case his residence is not found to be fit for home isolation by the surveillance team, the patient will be admitted to COVID Care Centre for isolation as per MoHFW guidelines,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lt-governor-tweaks-covid-order-on-home-isolation-after-meeting-kejriwal/story-MFnHDHMaiMRdyRR5mokTDK.html

Yet, it was a noble profession with respect in society. But the pandemic has made my life miserable,” Satyanarayana said.As his school was forced to close down abruptly due to the lockdown, Satyanarayana returned to his native village Aakaram in Shaligouraram block of Nalgonda district along with his wife and eight-month old son. “The school management paid me just Rs 5,000 for the month of March and threw up its hands. We had no other source of income to survive,” he lamented.Having no other option, Satyanarayana joined the other village youth to enroll himself as a labourer under National Rural Employment Guarantee Programme (NREGP) to earn his living. “I was paid Rs 150 per day as wages for doing desilting work in a local tank. But that was hardly enough. Later, I joined as a labourer in cotton fields, where I am getting around Rs 300 per day,” he said.The economic crisis has also forced him to swallow pride of being a post-graduate and take up any work to survive. “If I start thinking about my qualification, I will die of starvation,” Satyanarayana quipped.It is the same story with 40-year old Zaheer Ahmed Sheik, a double-post graduate from Mancherial district in northern Telangana, who worked as a Hindi teacher in a corporate school in Hyderabad for a monthly salary of Rs 15,000 till the Coronavirus pandemic struck.“Since I cannot survive in Hyderabad without a job, I came back to my town and have been working at an LPG warehouse doing loading and unloading of gas cylinders. I get Rs 500 per week. Besides, I also do painting of buildings. In all, I am earning Rs 5,000 a month,” said Zaheer, a father of two teen-aged sons. “I am scared if I think about the future,” he said.Tumki Praveen, a mathematics teacher from Jagtial town, frantically searched for a respectable job after he lost one in a private school. Finally, he ended up as a fruit seller in the market. “What else can I do? I don’t have money even to do a petty business,” he said.While Balaraju from Siddipet town, a science teacher, has taken to selling snacks (mirchi bajjis) and other eatables in a roadside kiosk, Karunakar, a post-graduate in English from the same town is earning Rs 400 per day working as a construction labourer and Ganne Jamuna from Jagtial has taken to her family profession of beedi making.According to Sheik Shabbir Ali, president of Telangana Private Teachers Federation, there are 11,700 recognised private schools in the state. “As per the official statistics, as many as 1,20,350 teachers were working in these schools, but unofficially, the number is more than 2.5 lakh. All of them are now on the roads,” he said.Though some corporate schools and big institutions have resumed online classes for the students, Shabbir Ali said, they engaged only a few teachers for it. “In many districts, several big schools have formed into a group and engaged common teachers to take up online classes for their students,” he said.In the neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, the situation is no different. Several private school teachers, who were suddenly rendered jobless, are forced to sell vegetables, work as construction labourers and daily wage workers.“I earned a lot of respect among students as a maths teacher and principal of a private school. But now, I have lost my job and am forced to go from street to street to sell eggs,” rued Nageshwara Rao of Jangareddygudem in West Godavari district.Didde Ambedkar, president of Andhra Pradesh Private School Teachers’ Union, said there are more than 12,000 recognised private schools in the state that provided employment to 1.25 lakh teachers. “Many schools have not paid salaries to the teachers since February, much before the lockdown was imposed,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-telangana-and-andhra-pvt-school-teachers-now-struggle-as-daily-wage-earners/story-R1Mr89YS9g3lh1s4XBN4xM.html

The former chief minister of Uttar Pradesh also questioned the UP government’s data on the number of beds available to treat coronavirus patients. “Coronavirus disease will never peak in the state of Uttar Pradesh because the honourable chief minister of the state is not getting enough tests conducted. How is it possible to assess when the disease is going to peak if enough tests are not conducted. Look at Delhi, they are going to conduct tests,” Akhilesh said drawing a comparison.Earlier this month, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Aditynath had told Hindustan that the state, as of June 5, had 32 labs in both private and public sector hospitals to test Covid samples. The state was testing around 12,000 people every day on an average and aimed to increase it to 20,000 by the end of June, he had said.Also Read: ‘Need to know the truth’: Akhilesh Yadav doesn’t agree with PM Modi’s statement on ChinaAkhilesh also contested Adityanath’s claim that work on several new medical colleges in the state was in progress. Akhilesh said the state government should name the new medical colleges it has built during its tenure.“The government must tell us if they have built any new medical college in the state. All they have done is to change the name of existing medical colleges,” the former UP CM said during an exclusive interview with Hindustan editor in chief Shashi Shekhar.On June 5, UP CM Aditynath had said that his government had managed to double the number of government hospitals in the state in the last three years.“There were only 12 government hospitals in the state since 1947 but the current UP government, since 2016, has started or is in the process of starting 30 new medical colleges, there are two functional AIIMS in UP right now-- in Gorakhpur and Rae Bareli,” Adityanath had said.Also Read: Adityanath directs officials to provide registration facility to migrant workers through mobile appsAkhilesh also questioned the state government’s claims on the number of beds available for the treatment of Covid cases. “BJP government claims to have readied one lakh beds for treatment of Covid patients. I am wondering how they reached the landmark after initially claiming to have only 36,000 beds,” Akhilesh asked. He suggested that there were only a few large medical hospitals in the state and therefore the claim of 10,000 Covid beds appeared to be out of sync with the reality.“Uttar Pradesh’s biggest medical colleges include KGMU and Ram Manohar Lohia institute in Lucknow and there are a few others including one in Saifai, Agra and Meerut. I want to know how many beds are ready in Lucknow alone,” Akhilesh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coronavirus-won-t-peak-in-up-akhilesh-jeers-at-state-s-handling-of-covid-crisis/story-vW7o1LlFCXF3CiZfx1SqJN.html
25-06-2020||India||Monsoon covers most parts of the country at least a week in advance||New Delhi: Monsoon has covered most parts of the country until Thursday. Usually, monsoon covers all parts of the country by July 8. Now, only parts of Rajasthan; Punjab and Haryana are left to be covered, according to India Meteorological Department (IMD).Monsoon arrived in Delhi on Wednesday and covered the city and all parts of the national capital region (NCR) on Thursday.IMD scientists said certain synoptic features this monsoon such as the development of cyclone Nisarga over the Arabian Sea, which coincided with the onset of monsoon over Kerala, and the formation of a low-pressure system over the Bay of Bengal soon after that helped the northern limit of monsoon (NLM) -- the northern-most boundary up to which monsoon rains have advanced -- advance very rapidly over the country.Monsoon is early over several states by at least a week, IMD’s NLM map showed.“Monsoon has already covered entire Uttar Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, most parts of Punjab, Chandigarh, Haryana and entire Delhi as on Thursday. This is because of a number of favourable conditions that helped the monsoon advance. Cyclone Nisarga had formed over the Bay of Bengal on June 1, which coincided with the arrival of monsoon over Kerala. We had a very good low-pressure system formed over the Bay of Bengal (around June 8), which helped monsoon advance both on the east and west coasts. There was a brief lull between July 16 and 22, but rains picked up again.

Akhilesh also said that he didn’t agree with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement at the recently held all-party meet regarding the status at the China border, which had triggered a political controversy.“The government should tell the truth to the people. People want to know exactly what happened at the border. BJP wants to say everything but the truth to the public. There are reports that Chinese troops build up at the LAC in Ladakh continues, this raises a big question over our national security,” Akhilesh said in an exclusive interview with Hindustan editor-in-chief Shashi Shekhar.Akhilesh was referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement in which he claimed that “no one has entered our territory, no one is at present within our territory and no one has occupied our posts”, while sharing details of circumstances surrounding clashes between Indian and Chinese army personnel. Watch l ‘BJP cites past to hide present reality’: Akhilesh Yadav on India-China faceoff “I do not agree with the statement given by the prime minister, there are several Indians who do not agree with his statement.

He added that the Doklam incident should have served as a warning to the Indian government.“The question around China is a big one. India faces greater threat from China than Pakistan. The leaders from Samajwadi Party have said that before,” Akhilesh said.The Samajwadi Party leader, who has also previously served as the chief minister of India’s largest state of Uttar Pradesh, backed measures including economic ones to contain China but not without ensuring that it doesn’t impact Indian businesses and markets.“SP has told the Centre that we need a long term strategy to contain China or we won’t succeed. We need to protect our markets and our business leaders. We can’t take rash decisions that adversely impact our economy,” Akhilesh said.He said that his party has maintained that India should upgrade its infrastructure on borders along China. He added that SP has been demanding construction of a highway at Lipulekh since 2012.Hitting out at the BJP government’s handling of the border crisis with China, Akhilesh said that the BJP tends to blame the previous Congress governments at the Centre instead of talking about its own work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-know-the-truth-akhilesh-yadav-doesn-t-agree-with-pm-modi-s-statement-on-china/story-72MWX3acTnaXCqFA05eJSP.html

25-06-2020||India||Public outcry over contentious environment ministry regulation||The environment ministry has received thousands of requests for extending the time frame for submitting public comments or objections to the draft Environment Impact Assessment Notification 2020, which is set to expire in five days on June 30.The draft, which is expected to overhaul the process of environmental regulation of infrastructure projects, is in the eye of a storm because it has contentious clauses on regularising projects that violate environmental norms and shortening the time frame for public hearings.The environment ministry has received thousands of requests from civil society organisations, legal researchers and students in the past month for further extending the period for comments and addressing concerns regarding the draft. “We have informed the environment minister’s office about these representations. A decision hasn’t been taken on extending the time for comments. As of now, it stands at June 30,” said Sharath Kumar Pallerla, director (policy wing) in the environment ministry. The draft notification was first released for comments on March 23 and people were provided a 60-day window to send comments or objections. But owing to the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown and stiff resistance from environmental groups, the environment ministry had extended the time frame for comments from May 22 to June 30.“The draft has been in the public domain for nearly 100 days now. In fact, we issued a zero draft to get people’s comments in April 2019, following which we held public consultations in several cities on the draft. Recently, we had consultations with industrial associations and accredited environmental consultants. But still we are receiving representations to extend time on this notification,” Pallerla said. After June 30, the thousands of comments received on the draft will be submitted to an expert committee, which will vet the comments and incorporate them in the draft if the members think it’s necessary or the draft will be notified as is.An RTI enquiry filed by an activist, a copy of which HT has seen, said the environment ministry was flooded with representations on the draft. Till April 20, the ministry had received 1,190 emails, of which 46 emails included suggestions and 1,144 emails had requests for extending the time frame for submitting comments. A joint secretary in the ministry had said she received more than 4,000 representations.“Since the EIA notification and any change thereto is of great significance to the management of environment in the country as a whole and to the matters of access and utilisation of natural resources…it is suggested that we may extend the time frame to a total of 180 days from the time of issue on March 23,” she wrote in a note to the environment minister. The note was, however, signed off with June 30 as the date till which the period for comments will be extended. Pallerla confirmed the ministry had received a lot of requests, following which it decided to extend the time for public responses. More than 50 university student unions, college environment clubs and youth groups from different parts of the country wrote to the environment ministry on Thursday, demanding the draft be put on hold and rewritten according to recommendations by environmental experts. “As we emerge from Covid-19, we need to make a choice about what kind of India we wish to live in. Our youth have decided to grow up on a land which has thriving forests and clean rivers, a balanced economy that places importance on sustainability and communities, and a system of policymaking that promotes dialogue with the citizens of India,” the statement by student unions said. The students’ campaign against the current draft EIA 2020 is led by Ashoka University along with members of All India Students Association, Youth4Swaraj, JNUSU, Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER), Jain University and Jindal Global Law School.The students wrote they had observed the effects of a weak environmental policy in recent months, as in the case of Mumbai’s Aarey forest, which was cleared to build a metro shed despite massive protests, Vizag’s LG Polymers gas leak on May 7 and Assam’s Baghjan gas blowout, which has allegedly destroyed a wetland and threatened biodiversity in Dibru Saikhowa National Park.“The environment ministry has 725 days, almost two years to issue the final notification based on the number and nature of comments received. Many of them are demanding strengthening environmental regulation in the light of the threefold crisis of health, climate and economy. This period between the draft and final notification should not be used to introduce the proposed changes into the existing 2006 notification, as has been done in the past with other laws such as the coastal regulation zone,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at the Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/public-outcry-over-contentious-environment-ministry-regulation/story-oQCimK5ldF50ZKMtaAQN2H.html
25-06-2020||India||Andhra HC closed till Sunday due to Covid-19 outbreak||The Andhra Pradesh high court (HC) on Thursday announced the suspension of its functioning till Sunday on the ground that there was an outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a day after HC registrar-general B Rajasekhar (59) died of cardiac arrest in Vijayawada.Chief Justice JK Maheshwari has directed that the functioning of the HC has been suspended till Sunday “due to an outbreak of Covid-19”, according to a notification issued by the HC registrar.The notification also said the work of metropolitan sessions judge court in Vijayawada has also been suspended till Sunday.Though the notification said the reason for the sudden closure of the HC for four days was an outbreak of Covid-19, it did not specify whether it occurred within the premises of the court.A senior advocate, who refused to be quoted, said the decision was taken following the sudden death of Rajasekhar on Wednesday. He was declared dead at a private hospital in Vijayawada.“We were told Rajasekhar had tested Covid-19 positive after he passed away. He had come in contact with a few judges before he collapsed in the court. Besides, some judges also went to the hospital to pay their last respects. The Chief Justice might have announced holidays for the court in a bid to sanitise its premises,” the advocate said.It is not yet known whether the Chief Justice, other judges and staff members of the court would undergo Covid-19 tests following Rajasekhar’s death, he added.The Chief Justice recently issued stringent guidelines for all the court employees, security personnel and visitors in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.As per the guidelines, the court officials and staff should not leave the headquarters without prior permission from the registrar-general. If anybody goes out by obtaining a permit, then that person must undergo quarantine before resuming duty.Thermal screening at the court’s entry point is mandatory and only those who are found wearing masks are allowed to enter the premises.There is strict compliance with social distancing norms and visitors to the court are allowed to stand in designated circles, the notification added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-hc-closed-till-sunday-due-to-covid-19-outbreak/story-Y8GFpkxioRLrKEDK97EvjP.html
25-06-2020||India||‘We lost golden hours’: Kerala activists rue delay in Covid-19 evacuation of expats||Mohammad Hussein (47) was working in Qatar for the last 20 years and was planning to return to India in May. In April, his family got a call from an organisation working among the expatriate community saying he contracted Covid-19 and his condition was serious. There was no news after this - a week later, his family in Kozhikode (north Kerala) got the photos of his burial.A substantial number of people from Kerala are working in the Gulf. According to the latest information, 296 people from the state died due to the coronavirus disease in the Gulf but activists working among expatriates say their number is more. Hussein’s family members at least got photos but others were not so lucky. And some families, who can afford, are keeping bodies of their dear ones in mortuary in the hope they can be brought back once the virus situation improves. “My father’s body is in a morgue in Bahrain. And we are paying through our nose. We hope the body can be brought back once the situation improves,” said the daughter of another deceased. The number of Kerala Gulf diaspora is estimated to be 18 lakh (2018 figure). And the remittances they sent that year was around 19 per cent of the total remittances sent by Indians abroad. In 2019, the figure jumped to Rs 1 lakh crore, the highest in the country, according to the state level bankers’ committee.The diaspora community has always helped the state government. They have loosened their purse strings in the times of disasters, but the community now feels it has been let down by both Centre and state governments during the Covid-19 pandemic.Union minister V Muraleedharan said that when the government started the flight services in May, the Centre was ready to fly at least 36 flights per day to Kerala. He said that the Kerala government restricted the number of flights to less than 12 saying they won’t be able to handle so many flights.The state government has, however, denied this.The expatriates, meanwhile, say that many lives could have been saved if the members of the community were evacuated in early days of the pandemic. “Even countries like Pakistan and the Philippines took their citizens in March-April and the country waited till the situation deteriorated. We lost golden hours. Many lives could have been saved if we’d evacuated them in early months. Now the state government itself says expatriates can be super spreaders,” said Reji Kuttappan, a writer and migrant rights activist.Their desperation was quite visible when the government-run non-Keralite resident association (Norka) opened a website in April for those who want to return and more than four lakh (4,56,431 to be exact) got themselves registered in two weeks. The state government said that 90,000 people have returned to the state but the Norka website puts the number at 55,905 till June 22.The expatriates say what really pained them is the fact that they were being stamped as super spreaders in many areas. Hate campaigns against those coming back to the state have been reported in north Kerala where 60 per cent of expatriates hail from. “Even CM Pinarayi Vijayan said the state put restrictions on returnees to check super spreaders. His words sent a wrong message,” said Mansoor Paloor, convenor of the Indian Overseas Congress.But Vijayan denied any laxity on the part of the state government and said there was a concerted move to array expatriates against the government. “We never blocked any flights. We took some decisions to check super spreaders and community spreading. More than 90 per cent of the cases in the state are imported, people came from abroad or other states,” he said. But Congress-led Opposition criticised the state government saying it was more interested in its records, not welfare of stranded people and that led to many deaths. “The government could have brought them home and treated them here instead of leaving them to death abroad,” said former chief minister Oommen Chandy.As the Centre and state spar over evacuation, the death rate in the expat community is steadily going up. There was a big outrage after the state made Covid-free certificates mandatory for returnees but the government stood its ground till the Centre rejected it saying tests were not feasible in embassies. At one point, the state said it was ready to send kits to test people before boarding flights but many expatriates feel the tussle and confusion cost them dearly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-lost-golden-hours-kerala-activists-rue-delay-in-covid-19-evacuation-of-expats/story-xn5dyv2Pahwih0xXFIQgIK.html
25-06-2020||India||Projects in Western Ghats threaten hinterland tourism: Stakeholders to Javadekar||Around 150 tourism stakeholders have written to Union Minister for Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) Prakash Javadekar and Minister for Tourism Prahlad Singh Patel, raising ecological concerns about three Central government projects that are likely to adversely impact the development of hinterland tourism in the coastal state.The projects are “directly opposing Goa’s 25-year vision to revamp the economy”, the letter stated.Goa is set to lose around 55,000 trees and 185 hectares (ha) of pristine forest cover in the Western Ghats for these projects such as the expansion of National Highway 4-A (NH 4-A), double-tracking of a railway track, and a new power transmission line.The railway project is expected to wipe out around 98 ha, or over half of the total green cover that is likely to be lost because of these three projects.The environmentalists have taken an exception to the concessions offered by the South Western Railways, which operates the line that is slated for double-tracking.Though the railway authorities have submitted an undertaking and have made provisions for eight underpasses for the crossing of wild animals in consultation with the state forest department, these concessions have failed to impress the environmentalists.“These projects will lead to widespread deforestation in the area. The future development of hinterland tourism will be adversely affected. Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park are an integral part of Goa’s nature tourism. The current community-based tourism initiatives within the protected areas will be destroyed. It will damage the local economy and deny an opportunity to make Goa a global leader in sustainable tourism,” the letter stated.“Biodiversity conservation, which can be a major tourist attraction, requires locals’ support for the implementation of various community-driven programmes and make them champion the conservation causes,” it added.This is the second letter addressed to Javadekar, urging him to reconsider the environmental clearances.Earlier, environmental researchers and conservationists had written to the minister, warning him of severe ecological consequences if these projects see the light of the day.Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary and Mollem National Park are the state’s oldest and largest bio-diverse reserve and are home to many tourist attractions such as the 12th Century Tambdi Surla temple carved out of basalt rock, gurgling Devil’s Canyon, and Dudhsagar Falls.“The state’s tourism industry is staring at an uncertain future, as the Central government is overlooking the ecological concerns and making hazardous industrial concessions,” said Pooja Rani, co-founder of Khoj-aao! Adventures, a member of the Responsible Tourism Collective, and one of the signatories to the letter. “Hinterland tourism has a huge potential to create jobs. Dudhsagar Falls has a massive captive mass market. The authorities need to promote small scale, locally-owned initiatives for agriculture and nature tourism sectors,” said Ashok Malkarnekar, a partner at Dudhsagar Plantation.The projects, which have been in the works for the past two years, were approved during the 57th meeting of the standing committee of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) under the MoEFCC on April 20.The meeting was held via video-conference amid the nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/projects-in-western-ghats-threaten-hinterland-tourism-stakeholders-to-javadekar/story-2DUU8wcDfmhYzr8nwlztQJ.html

At present that question doesn’t arise. Revival of economy has just started. Livelihood is very essential. If you go back, I think it becomes very difficult and people will face problems,” said C.N. Ashwath Narayan according to ANI.Earlier in the day, chief minister Yediyurappa had expressed concern over rising Covid-19 cases in Bengaluru and urged people to maintain social distancing and sanitisation to avoid another lockdown.On Monday, the government had decided to seal four major areas in the state capital Bengaluru to contain the spread of Covid-19.The state’s health minister B Sriramulu said that there is no community transmission in the state.“Seal down has been implemented at four locations in Bengaluru. More tests are being done in these locations. We have also made arrangements to test senior citizens,” Sriramulu said after a cabinet meeting according to ANI.“Situation is under control, there’s no community transmission. We’re working with the CM. We took opinion from experts. They’re of the opinion that people from outside are coming to Bengaluru so the number of cases are increasing here,” he said.Covid-19 cases in Karnataka crossed the 10,000 mark on Wednesday. Earlier, JD (S) leader and former CM H D Kumaraswamy had demanded that the government impose a 20-day statewide lockdown to prevent the rapid spread of the virus.On Wednesday, Kumaraswamy appealed to the people of the state to impose a self-declared curfew and stay at home asserting that life was more important than the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-minister-rules-out-full-lockdown-in-bengaluru/story-BjFa6eVcTMTdNplbgE8svK.html

Today, more than 2 lakh swabs (are) produced everyday by domestic manufacturers,” a health ministry tweet said.The ministry said that the country, as of Thursday, had at least 15 indigenous manufacturers of coronavirus testing kits.

It is on Emergency||“The Emergency reminds us that democracies, when tested, fight back resiliently,” former union minister Milind Deora said on Thursday, in a rare instance when a Congress leader spoke about the emergency.On this day 45 years ago, former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared emergency across India.The emergency was issued by President Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed under Article 352(1) of the Constitution and lasted 21 long months.beginning June 25, 1975 and ended on March 21, 1977.ALSO READ | ‘I salute those who defended democracy during Emergency’: PM“The #Emergency reminds us that democracies, when tested, fight back resiliently.

When will this government listen?” Gandhi had tweeted in Hindi.But Deora differed. “India imports Brent crude - not WTI - currently priced at $21 per barrel. We will import less oil due to weakened demand. Falling rupees may also offset gains from low oil prices. Lastly, when car truck buses train and planes are sitting idle, consumers can’t gain from petrol and diesel price cuts,” he tweeted.Prior to that, Deora, a former Mumbai Congress chief, had praised Delhi chief minister and Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Arvind Kejriwal for his government having doubled Delhi’s revenue over the past five years.“Brother, you want to leave @INCIndia-Please do-Then propagate half baked facts!” senior party leader Ajay Maken said and compared the revenue generated from 1998 onwards when the Congress was in power to that under the Kejriwal government. “However, let me share even lesser known facts-1997-98-BE (Revenue) 4,073cr, 2013-14-BE (Revenue) 37,459cr…During Congress Govt Grew at 14.87% CAGR (Compound Annual Growth Rate). 2015-16 BE 41,129, and 2019-20 BE 60,000… AAP Gov 9.90% CAGR,” he tweeted.Deora retorted on Monday. “Brother, I would never undermine Sheila Dikshit’s stellar performance as Delhi CM. That’s your specialty. But it’s never too late to change! Instead of advocating an alliance with AAP, if only you had highlighted Sheila ji’s achievements, @INCIndia would’ve been in power today,” he tweeted.Deora’s praise prompted angry reactions from Congress leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/emergency-reminds-us-that-democracies-when-tested-fight-back-resiliently-milind-deora/story-IKPCUaz5Levx4HDh6uHoEL.html

While 1,736 have died due to the infection, as many as 21,096 have been discharged.Around 400 fresh cases of coronavirus are emerging in in the state on a daily basis since last one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-leave-for-gujarat-cops-as-personnel-required-for-unlock-1-says-state-govt/story-8um9FyNLqtI6zwowPTYgXO.html
25-06-2020||India||UN chief follows up on US’ harsh report on Pak-backed terror with a polite reminder||United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expects all member states to “live up” to their obligations under the relevant Security Council resolutions, his spokesperson said after a US State Department report classified Pakistan as a “safe haven” for terrorists.The US report had also underscored that Jaish-e-Mohammad founder Masood Azhar and 2008 Mumbai terror attacks mastermind Sajid Mir were “widely believed” to be living “under the protection of the state” in Pakistan. The report mirrors concerns expressed by New Delhi on numerous occasions about Pakistan’s complicity in sponsoring, promoting or supporting terrorists operating from its territory The UN chief’s spokesperson Stéphane Dujarric told reporters that the UN Secretary General’s office wouldn’t comment on the US report. But he went ahead to deliver his message nonetheless.“Obviously, as a matter of principle, we do expect all member states to live up to their obligations as laid out in any relevant Security Council resolution or Security Council decision,” Stéphane Dujarric told a media briefing in Washington, according to news agency Press Trust of India.At last count, Pakistan is home to 130 entities in the United Nations Security Council’s 1267 Sanctions List.But several UNSC Sanctions monitoring teams have noted that Islamabad hasn’t acted against most of them. Like when Islamabad told a visiting UNSC team in March this year that they had not been able to even identify or locate most of the 130 designated terrorists.According to counter-terror officials in Delhi, Pakistan acknowledges the presence of only 19 terrorists sanctioned by the UNSC on its territory including Jaish founder Masood Azhar who was designated global terrorist only in May last year, 10 years after India first pushed to have him blacklisted. The US had designated Azhar as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist in 2010. The latest state department report noted that Pakistan had made “no effort to use domestic authorities to prosecute” terrorist figures such as Azhar and Lashkar operative Sajjid Mir.Sajjid Mir had ordered Ajmal Kasab’s team of terrorists to kill the Israeli couple in Chabad House during the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks.The United States has pushed Pakistan for long through threats and appeals to arrest and prosecute terrorists sheltered there. In the state department’s 2019 country reports on terrorism released Wednesday, it had welcomed the prosecution of Hafiz Saeed, the founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba, in 2019, along with 12 associates but underlined there were many others who had been left out.Hafiz Saeed’s arrest and prosecution, for the ninth time, in 2019, had come under intense global pressure as Pakistan faced the possibility of being blacklisted at the initiative of the US by a global watchdog on terror financing and money-laundering, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force.Pakistan narrowly escaped then, but has remained in the dock, as the US terror report reminded. “The FATF expressed serious concern at its October 2019 plenary about Pakistan’s continued deficiencies but noted it had made some progress and extended the deadline for full Action Plan implementation to February 2020.” A final call is expected later in the year, in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/un-chief-follows-up-on-us-harsh-report-on-pak-backed-terror-with-a-polite-reminder/story-vYYscfE4VxvYfMkdOzuadP.html
25-06-2020||India||Private players can build and launch space missions, says ISRO chief||The opening up of the space sector to private players would boost the country’s industrial base and improve access to space-based services, said K Sivan, chairman, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), in a video address on Thursday morning.Earlier, the Union Cabinet had announced the setting up a new arm of the space organisation -- Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) – that will independently evaluate and approve space-related activities in the country.The chairman said IN-SPACe would be an independent body.“The government has approved the establishment of an autonomous nodal agency IN-SPACe under the Department of Space (DoS) for taking independent decisions on permitting and regulating the activities of private companies in the space sector. The decision of IN-SPACe will be binding on all stakeholders, including ISRO,” said Sivan.IN-SPACe may take up to six months to become operational and until then, private entities can apply through the Bengaluru-based DoS.“We will process their requirements. Private companies have approached us for using ISRO facilities. We are processing their requests on a fast-track mode,” said Sivan.IN-SPACe will have its own directorates for technical, legal, safety and security, and promotion.The board of IN-SPACe will also have representations from the industry, academia, and the Central government.ISRO will share the technical expertise and facilities for promoting the private sector in space.Private companies via IN-SPACe would be allowed to build facilities within the DoS premises as per the need and feasibility, the chairman said.India has one rocket launch centre at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, which is also likely to be used by the private sector. The private sector will be allowed to provide end-to-end space services, including building and launching of rockets and satellites, and providing these services commercially.Now, all launch vehicles and satellites are designed by ISRO scientists and private players manufacture their components.Last year, the government had set up an industry consortium to expedite the production of Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV), an expendable medium-lift launch vehicle designed and operated by ISRO.The ISRO chairman pointed out the need to introduce new policies and the revamp of outdated ones in a bid to make the system more efficient.Sivan said that the role of the New Space India Limited – the commercial arm of ISRO that was set up last year – would be modified to acquire existing launch vehicles and satellite technologies and make them commercially viable through industry consortiums. It would also undertake the transfer of technology (ToT) activities, he added.“ISRO will continue to carry out advanced research and development, interplanetary missions, human spaceflight and capacity-building activities,” the chairman said.Experts have been demanding that the private sector be involved in the country’s routine space activities such as the launch of existing communication and earth observation satellites, which will free up resources for critical scientific explorations.India’s scientific space endeavours have been gathering momentum such as another lander-rover mission to the moon, solar mission Aditya L1, human spaceflight programme, and a mission to Venus in the next few years.ISRO has had only one mission in January this year, when communication satellite GSAT-30 was launched by the France-based commercial launcher Arianespace from Kourou, French Guiana, on January 17, and since March, the country, along with the rest of the world, is busy grappling with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-players-can-build-and-launch-space-missions-says-isro-chief/story-YEwSemiGHr8uWtkAn9wnaI.html
25-06-2020||India||BJP, Congress trade barbs on 45th anniversary of emergency||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress traded accusations about lack of democracy in their respective political parties on the 45th anniversary of the Emergency on Thursday.Union home minister Amit Shah attacked the Congress and said the opposition party should ask why the “Emergency mindset” continues. He made a pointed reference to Tuesday’s Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, where former union minister RPN Singh had called for refraining from direct attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Singh, who is in-charge of the party’s affairs in Jharkhand, insisted Congress leaders should criticise the government’s policies and raise people-centric issues.However, he was countered by all senior and young leaders, including Priyanka Gandhi Vadra, who praised former Congress president Rahul Gandhi for taking on Modi.For his part, Rahul Gandhi has said he will continue to attack the prime minister, adding “it is Modi alone who formulates policies and takes all decisions” in the government.“I cannot attack Rajnath Singh or Nirmala Sitharaman or anyone else. All decisions are taken by Modi. He is the defence minister, the finance minister, the education minister…everything, and I am not scared of him. If the CWC doesn’t want me to attack him, I will stop it,” Rahul Gandhi was quoted as saying at the meeting by a Congress functionary.Singh then clarified that all he wanted was a calibrated attack on the government on its policies and decisions.In a series of tweets to mark the 45th anniversary of the Emergency, Shah took a dig at the Congress leadership and the Gandhi family without naming it. “During the recent CWC meet, senior members and younger members raised a few issues. But, they were shouted down. A party Spokesperson was unceremoniously sacked. The sad truth is – leaders are feeling suffocated in Congress,” he tweeted and attached a link to a news report about the proceedings at the CWC.Shah’s comment was in reference to the removal of Sanjay Jha as the party’s spokesperson, after he criticised and questioned the Congress leadership in an opinion piece.In a separate tweet, Shah said, “As one of India’s opposition parties, Congress needs to ask itself: why does the emergency mindset remain? Why are the leaders who don’t belong to one dynasty unable to speak up? Why are leaders getting frustrated in Congress? Else, the disconnect with the people will keep widening.”Shah said it was due to the efforts of lakhs of people that the Emergency was lifted, but democracy is still missing in the Congress. “Democracy was restored in India but it remained absent in the Congress. The interests of one family prevailed over party interests and national interests. This sorry state of affairs thrives in today’s Congress too!” he tweeted.The Congress vehemently denied these allegations, but Shah pinned the blame for the Emergency on the Gandhi family, without naming names. He said, “On this day 45 years ago, one family’s greed for power led to the imposition of the Emergency and turned the nation in to a prison. The press, the courts, free speech…all were trampled over. Atrocities were committed on the poor and the downtrodden.”Shah’s comments drew a sharp response from Congress leaders.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted, “And so spoke those, who occupied present positions by forcibly retiring & humiliating every patriarch & colleague who built them. And the list is long....Sh. L.K. Advani, Sh. M.M.Joshi, Sh. Keshubhai Patel, Sh. Kalraj Mishra, Smt. Sushma Swaraj, Sh. Haren Pandya, Sh. Sanjay Joshi.” Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and Rajya Sabha member Digvijaya Singh questioned Shah’s statement and said the Congress party considers the Gandhi family a binding force. “Who in Congress is opposed to Rahul ji or Priyanka ji? Name one senior leader? Whole Congress unitedly stands with Nehru Gandhi Family. They are the binding force. What is more important is the ideological clarity among Congress leaders junior or senior which is harming the Party,” he tweeted.In a separate tweet, Singh said, “Rather it’s lack of Ideological Clarity that leads to ambiguous stand. Why do some shy away from fighting RSS? It’s divisive Ideology of Polarisation & Anti Poor, Anti Farmer, Anti Labour policies are destroying the Unity & Integrity of India, destroying its Socio Economic fabric.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-trade-barbs-on-45th-anniversary-of-emergency/story-Qs2yGi9xSay5DaYnLUA34N.html
25-06-2020||India||Diesel costs dearer in Delhi as prices surge past Rs 80 per litre for the first time||The price of diesel in Delhi crossed Rs 80 a litre for the first time on Thursday after the 19th consecutive rate hike since June 7, even as international oil prices plunged by 5.44%. The petrol price surge, which was paused for a day on Wednesday after the 17th hike in a row, also saw a jump of 16 paise a litre on Thursday. Petrol is now selling in Delhi’s pumps at Rs 79.92 a litre and diesel at Rs 80.02. Retail rates of auto fuels differ from city to city across the country due to variations in local levies.Indian fuel retailers fix petrol and diesel rates every day on the basis of prevailing rates of the two products in the international market on the preceding day. International product prices move in tandem with global crude prices.The state-run fuel retailers – Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd (HPCL) – declined to give reasons for the price hike on Thursday despite a sharp fall in international oil prices. Public sector oil companies control more than 90% of the domestic fuel retail trade.The benchmark Brent crude on Wednesday plunged sharply by 5.44% to $40.31 a barrel. It softened further on Thursday by 1.98% and was hovering around the $39.5 per barrel-mark. India’s average crude oil import price in April was $19.90 a barrel, $30.60 a barrel in May and about $40.5 a barrel in June (as on June 24), according to official data.A petroleum ministry official, requesting anonymity, said the government has no role in the daily revision of petrol and diesel prices as they are deregulated products. The government deregulated the pricing of petrol on June 26, 2010 and diesel on October 19, 2014.Executives of the two public sector oil companies, speaking on condition of anonymity, said petrol and diesel rates are high because of a significant jump in central levies and state-level taxes, while international crude oil prices are low.Ruling Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) leader Amit Malviya tweeted that diesel was costlier than petrol in Delhi because of higher levies imposed on the fuel by the local government. “VAT [value-added tax] on diesel was 16.75%, which Delhi government, in May 2020, abruptly increased to 30%. During the same period, VAT on petrol increased from 27 to 30%,” he said.The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), which rules Delhi, blamed the BJP-led Central government for the unprecedented price hike. “Loot of Lotus! Fuel prices hiked for 19 days in a row,” it tweeted. Lotus is the BJP’s party symbol.In a tweet, the Congress party said the hike in “excise duty on petrol was 258% and diesel was 820% since 2014”. It added, “BJP Govt promised to improve the life of every Indian, the reality is far from it, the govt has made matters only worse.”According to IOC’s website, the total taxes on petrol and diesel are more than their basic rates. While the basic price of petrol in Delhi was Rs 22.11 a litre on June 16, taxes on the fuel (both central excise and state levies) were Rs 50.69 a litre. Similarly, the basic price of diesel was Rs 22.93 a litre, but the total taxes levied on the fuel were Rs 49.43 a litre. IOC did not disclose the current pricing details. While auto fuel rates are theoretically changed every day, the company provides price build-up of petrol and diesel only fortnightly. Taking advantage of low international oil prices, the Union government raised excise duties on petrol and diesel twice – first on March 14 by Rs 3 a litre each, and later on May 5 by Rs 10 a litre on petrol and Rs 13 on diesel. A Re-1 per litre hike in excuse duty means an additional Rs 14,500 crore in revenues to the exchequer.Almost all states have raised VAT on petrol and diesel since mid-March. The Delhi government raised VAT on petrol and diesel to 30% on May 5. Consequently, retail prices of petrol in the city jumped by Rs 1.67 per litre and diesel by Rs 7.10 a litre. Earlier, the local levies on petrol and diesel were 27% and 16.75%, respectively. Diesel in Delhi also attracts an additional Rs 250 per kilolitre air ambience charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diesel-crosses-rs-80-per-litre-in-delhi-for-first-time-after-the-19th-consecutive-rate-hike-since-june-7/story-8Wep66jed75B22LPmFIEnI.html

DHROA, a group of budget hotels in Delhi, said its members include around 3,000 budget hotels and guest houses across the city. The umbrella body said these facilities collectively have 75,000 rooms. The association’s decision followed a call by the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) to boycott Chinese goods after the June 15 clash between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley that killed 20 Indian soldiers.However, all hotels and guest houses in Delhi are yet to open for business since the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown was imposed in March. Mahendra Gupta, general secretary of the association, said all hotels in Delhi registered with DHROA are expected to abide by its call to deny accommodation to Chinese nationals.“The way China is behaving with India, there is a lot of anger among hotel businessmen in Delhi. At a time when CAIT has campaigned for a boycott of Chinese goods across the country, the hotel and guest house owners of Delhi will actively take part in this. In view of that, we have decided not to give accommodation to any Chinese national in any budget hotel or guest house across the city, ”Gupta said.The association has also decided not to use any Chinese products at its hotels, he said. Praveen Khandelwal, national secretary General of CAIT, welcomed the move and said it is now clear people from different sectors are backing the call to boycott Chinese goods initiated.“CAIT will now contact national organisations of transporters, farmers, hawkers, small-scale industries, consumers and entrepreneurs and connect them with this campaign,” Khandelwal said.The death of the 20 soldiers marked the first Indian casualties in a skirmish with the People’s Liberation Army since October 1975, when Chinese troops ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-nationals-won-t-be-provided-accommodation-in-hotels-and-guest-houses-delhi-hotel-association/story-iz3NRdWiUMhBvP90RVDGzI.html

The 13-member task force will meet for the first time on Friday. “There will be deliberations this week, following which the government will announce the measures,” a senior official from the state government said on condition of anonymity.However, experts have warned of a second wave of coronavirus infections in July and called for a gradual relaxation of restrictions. “If we start everything from July 1, we might have a second wave around July 15, and we need to be very mindful of this. Relaxations in a controlled manner can enable us to tackle the virus in a comfortable manner,” Shashank Joshi, a member of the state-appointed task force said on Wednesday. The state-appointed task force includes specialist doctors from government and private hospitals who suggest measures to minimise the death rate and for the clinical management of the Covid-19 patients who are critically ill. Peehu Pardeshi of the Tata Institute of Social Sciences said, “There have been new spurts [of infections] with relaxations. Phase-wise relaxation should be accompanied by stricter monitoring and ensuring social distancing.”On May 31, the government extended the lockdown till June 30, and announced phased easing of restrictions. All markets, commercial areas and shops were opened on an odd-even basis from June 5.After that, private offices were allowed to operate with up to 10% of their staff according to needs, with the remaining staff working from home. Intra-district bus services were allowed from June 8. Maharashtra continues to be the worst affected state, with more than 140,000 Covid-19 cases reported till Wednesday evening. The state reported 208 fatalities on Wednesday, taking the toll to 6,739.Mumbai recorded 1,118 new infections and 82 fatalities on Wednesday, inching closer to the 70,000-mark for infections, which were at 69,528.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region, which consists of an urban agglomeration around the city, has seen a spurt in cases, causing concern for the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-more-relaxations-of-covid-19-related-restrictions-expected-after-30-june/story-GvCInqoFvXjETRSMsWjTfK.html

The incident took place on Wednesday night at Dhanikorta village under Kukanar police station limits where a road is being constructed, Sukma Superintendent of Police Shalabh Sinha said.As per preliminary information, a group of ultras reached the village, located around 450 km from the capital Raipur, and set ablaze three trucks, two JCBs and a poclain machine parked there, he said.All the vehicles and machines belonged to a contractor, he said.Despite being advised to park the vehicles and machines at a police camp near the construction site after completing work for the day, the contractor left them at the village, the official said.Soon after being alerted about the incident, security personnel rushed to the spot on Thursday morning and launched a search operation in the area, he added.Maoists have frequently tried to disrupt road construction works in the state’s Bastar division, comprising seven districts including Sukma, by launching attacks on security forces and damaging vehicles and machines used in those projects.They feel the developmental works in the region and construction of roads will uproot them from the area, a police official earlier said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoists-torch-vehicles-machines-at-road-construction-site-in-chhattisgarh-s-sukma-district/story-YYOIIcMuG8Dg44EJBc3IVO.html

Those conducting clinical trials without government permission are misleading the people and strict action will be taken against them,” he warned.Regarding Ramdev’s claim, Sharma said that Ayurvedic medicines could act as immunity boosters but claiming a cure without permission of the Ayush ministry was not acceptable.Baba Ramdev had on Tuesday claimed that his team of researchers at Patanjali Ayurved had found a medicine to cure Covid-19. Ramdev said clinical trials had been conducted along with the National Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS) University in Jaipur.NIMS director Dr Anurag Tomar said that all the necessary approvals for the clinical trials had been taken and permission from CTRI was taken before the trials were conducted.The Ayush ministry has asked Baba Ramdev to provide details about the medicine and to stop advertising the products.Sharma warned that if anyone was found selling the Baba Ramdev’s claimed medicine for curing Covid-19, strict action will be taken against that seller.The minister further said that a gazette notification issued on June 21, 2020 by the Centre under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and 1945, says that no one can sell any Ayurvedic drug for Covid-19 without permission from the Ayush ministry.“If anyone is found selling any drug for curing Covid-19, strict action will be taken against the seller as per the law,” Sharma said in a statement.He said that Rajasthan government is complying with the guidelines of the Union health ministry, the Ayush ministry and the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in treatment of Covid-19 patients.Sharma said if anyone wants to conduct clinical trials, these have to approved by the scientific advisory bodies and institutional ethics committee. He added that after the proposal to conduct clinical trial is registered with Clinical Trials Registry India (CTRI), the sample size should be adequate and the trials have to be as per guidelines of Ayush ministry and ICMR and has to be done as per the biomedical and health research guidelines.“The human participation has to be as per ICMR’s national ethical guidelines, and participation by registered Ayush doctors has to be ensured,” said Sharma.Regarding NIMS, the Rajasthan minister said that suspected Covid-19 patients had been kept there in institutional quarantine for a few days. “How could clinical trials be conducted on them when it was not clear whether they were infected with the coronavirus?”On Baba Ramdev’s claims that patients on whom clinical trials were conducted had recovered in seven days, Sharma said in normal course too, patients are recovering in seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anyone-found-selling-ramdev-s-covid-19-medicine-will-face-action-rajasthan-minister/story-G55JrqKtJq3Di3RT8M7FkJ.html
25-06-2020||India||India joins ‘Alliance for Poverty Eradication’ at UN as founding member||India has become a founding member of an Alliance for Poverty Eradication at the UN, launched by the President of the General Assembly, aimed at focussing on efforts to boost global economy in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic.President of the 74th Session of the UN General Assembly Tijjani Muhammad-Bande will formally launch the ‘Alliance for Poverty Eradication’ on June 30, which he said will serve as a forum for Member States to raise awareness about the danger that poverty poses to world peace, human rights and sustainable development.He will also galvanise Member States, the international community and other stakeholders to support actions geared towards poverty eradication. India has joined the alliance as a founding member and stressed that ending poverty is not just about monetary compensation but guaranteeing access of the poor to quality education, healthcare, clean water, sanitation, decent housing and social security.“There are people in the world so hungry that God cannot appear to them except in the form of bread. Global inequality is deeply entrenched. It’s shocking to note that just a little over 2000 billionaires have more wealth than 60 per cent of the planet’s wealth,” India’s Deputy Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador Nagaraj Naidu said.Speaking at the informal meeting of the President of the General Assembly and members of the Alliance on Tuesday, Naidu said Covid-19 has added a new dimension to poverty, stressing that “poverty is like punishment for a crime that one did not commit.” He stressed that the Alliance for Poverty Eradication should contribute to the policy discourse that seeks to analyse poverty from the perspective of multiple deprivations. “For instance, people experience poverty differently even within the same household. While data is limited, there is evidence that women and children are disproportionately affected by poverty. Hence, gender mainstreaming is vital for policy design and implementation,” he said.A concept note on the formation of the alliance with the UN said that it aims to provide a forum at which participants would deliberate on measures that need to be instituted so as to get the world economy working in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic, canvass support for efforts that have proved effective in alleviating and ultimately eradicating poverty within and across the world’s regions.The concept note said that before Covid-19 practically shut down socio-economic activities across the globe, the number of people classified as poor was approximately 2.1 billion. Of this number, 767 million were found to be living in extreme poverty. “While the extent of the damage wrought by Covid-19 to world economy is yet to be determined, the pandemic threatens not only to erase past gains but also to force an additional half a billion of the world population into poverty,” the note said.Naidu also emphasised that the alliance should call for inclusion and empowerment of those left behind as a priority, targeting those furthest behind. It should also brainstorm about sectors where jobs could be generated in the age of digitisation and automatisation and distribute successful case studies from member states that have successfully integrated economic, social and environmental policies that have helped in poverty alleviation. “The alliance should also use the United Nations development system to enable it to bring together its special expertise and policy portfolios to focus on integrated system-wide action for poverty eradication,” Naidu said.He pointed out that India is implementing a comprehensive development strategy based on a digital foundation to end poverty in all its forms, through accelerated economic growth and broader social safety nets. According to United Nations Development Programme, between 2006-2016 over 271 million people in India moved out of poverty, recording the fastest reductions in the multidimensional poverty index values during the period. “Let’s join hands to make this alliance a leading voice for poverty eradication. Let’s work to bring dignity to life,” Naidu said. The concept note said the alliance will ideally start with a nucleus of like-minded countries and move steadily to bring others on board and when fully operational, the alliance will be the leading voice for poverty eradication.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-joins-alliance-for-poverty-eradication-at-un-as-founding-member/story-MmOJ7AShzdX1hiNU5ersbK.html

25-06-2020||India||‘I salute those who defended democracy during Emergency’: PM||Prime Minister Narendra Modi paid tributes to people who opposed the Emergency imposed by the Congress led government at the Centre, saying the country will never forget their sacrifice.“The Emergency was imposed in the country exactly 45 years ago. The people who struggled to defend the democracy at that time, I salute them. The country will never forget their sacrifice,” PM Modi tweeted in Hindi on Thursday. आज से ठीक 45 वर्ष पहले देश पर आपातकाल थोपा गया था। उस समय भारत के लोकतंत्र की रक्षा के लिए जिन लोगों ने संघर्ष किया, यातनाएं झेलीं, उन सबको मेरा शत-शत नमन! उनका त्याग और बलिदान देश कभी नहीं भूल पाएगा। pic.twitter.com/jlQVJQVrsXThe Emergency was imposed on June 25, 1975.PM Modi attached a clip of his Mann ki Baat radio address last year in which he had spoken about the Emergency era. The Congress government at the Centre was headed by Indira Gandhi at that time.PM Modi’s tweet comes hours after home minister Amit Shah posed a few questions before the Congress and gave some advice to the Opposition party.“As one of India’s opposition parties, Congress needs to ask itself: Why does the Emergency mindset remain? Why are leaders who don’t belong to 1 dynasty unable to speak up? Why are leaders getting frustrated in Congress? Else, their disconnect with people will keep widening,” he tweeted on Thursday.He indirectly targeted the Gandhi family by talking about the dynasty and claimed that leaders in the Congress are getting frustrated.The war of words has been going on between the BJP and the Congress since the June 15 skirmish in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley. The Congress has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of giving away Indian territory to China.PM Modi had asserted at the all-party meeting that “no one has entered our territory, no one is at present within our territory and no one has occupied our posts”. This was in reference to the situation in the Galwan Valley after Indian Army’s brave action to thwart Chinese attempts to erect a structure on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).BJP chief JP Nadda had attacked the Congress party for questioning the government’s stand on June 15 face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh. He said that “a rejected and ejected dynasty is not equal to the entire Opposition”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-salute-those-who-defended-democracy-during-emergency-pm-modi/story-8GUEelNDkHSntG1zNpKtkN.html

25-06-2020||India||Health ministry and Indian Red Cross launch app to order blood in Delhi-NCR||Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Thursday launched ebloodservices app, in partnership with the Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS), for easy access to blood needed for transfusion.“This is like placing request for blood right at your doorstep. I received several complaints over the past few months from people on lack of access to safe blood, especially from those people who need regular blood donation owing to their chronic blood disorders. It will be beneficially in these corona times when commutation has become a problem and those needing blood may not be able to go from one blood bank to another,” said Vardhan.“This app shall bring transparency in the blood donation programme and minimise the worries of those in dire need of blood. Our voluntary blood donors should come forward in large numbers as their contribution is required more than ever now,” he added.To begin with, the app will cater to entire Delhi-NCR, and has the facility of placing an order for up to four units in one go.“Through this app, the availability of blood will be visible right in your phone. Once an order has been placed then the blood bank will keep the request active for 12 hours. The order will be diverted to the next patient only after the original recipient fails to collect it within 12 hours,” said RK Jain, secretary general, Indian Red Cross Society.The app’s scope will be expanded in future, with plans of linking more blood banks to it and also in other cities.“This is a useful app and there are plans of expanding its reach gradually,” said Harsh Vardhan.Jain said that initial few weeks could be challenging for the proper functioning of the app. “We are expecting to face glitches initially for at least 15 days to about a month as we do not know the exact demand of blood in the region as of now. It will take some time before we know how much blood is needed and act accordingly,” said Jain.To meet the demand for blood in the city, the Red Cross blood bank had started conducting blood donation camps by sending mobile blood collection units to various localities in and around Delhi. The Red Cross blood bank was also offering pick and drop facility to voluntary blood donors. “We have ensured there is no shortage of blood and whatever demand comes our way we are able to manage it,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-and-indian-red-cross-launch-mobile-app-to-order-blood-in-delhi-ncr/story-wenGCpMgIRuA59MV0NJgAN.html

The court said that any communication gap between the government and hospitals should be reduced. The court has also asked the Kejriwal government to appoint “dedicated officers” for the same. Earlier this month, Delhi HC had directed the Centre and the Delhi government to update data in real-time on the availability of beds and other healthcare facilities provided to the Covid-19 patients.  Delhi High Court asks Delhi Govt to appoint "dedicated officers" so that there should be no communication gap between the government and hospitals. https://t.co/smKuneWmgbThe court’s directions came after hearing a plea it had initiated itself. It was contested that the “Delhi Corona Mobile Application”, developed by Delhi government, is not being updated regularly and that there exists a mismatch of the facts and data released by the government and private hospitals in Delhi, especially concerning the availability of beds and ventilators.A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan had also directed the Centre and the Delhi government to carry out testing as far as far as possible, subject to availability of testing kits with priority being given to the persons approaching for test on the recommendation of a doctor.Meanwhile, State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) will hold a meeting today evening to discuss home isolation rules for Covid-19 patients in Delhi. The Kejriwal government has categorically opposed the current format of home isolation rules for coronavirus patients and a decision on it is likely to be taken during in the meeting today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/take-strict-action-delhi-hc-s-directive-against-erring-hospitals-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-epnl836ES9FIQrxv1xX4XL.html
25-06-2020||India||Panel calls for bringing Lok Sabha, Rajya Sabha TV under single body||An expert committee set up to explore the possibility of merging the state-run Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV channels has recommended they be brought under a “Sansad TV” platform while continuing to work separately to showcase work done in both houses of Parliament.According to a person familiar with developments, the committee headed by former Prasar Bharati chief A Surya Prakash felt there could be an integrated platform with two variants to increase efficiency and ensure better use of resources.“Lok Sabha TV may continue to telecast live proceedings of Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha TV of the upper House. During the inter-session period and beyond the working hours of Parliament, both can telecast common content to a large extent. Lok Sabha TV will do so in Hindi and Rajya Sabha TV in English,” an official said, citing the panel’s recommendation.The panel was set up last November by Rajya Sabha chairman M Venkaiah Naidu and Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla to consider the functional integration of both channels.The panel suggested the new formats could help the two channels overcome shortcomings of the current bilingual format.Sansad TV and its two variants should have a robust editorial policy to emerge as the choice of a large number of people who want to know about the functioning of parliamentary institutions, the committee has said.The committee recommended effective use of available resources, such as relocating Rajya Sabha TV from the Talkatora Stadium annexe and shifting it to space available with Lok Sabha TV at Mahadev Road. This will lead to savings in terms of the huge rent paid as of now.According to the official cited above, the committee also discussed the issue with members of Parliament, who suggested the proposed Sansad TV should capture developmental activities undertaken by MPs. “The proposal is under consideration. Three subcommittees are examining it in detail,” said the official.Lok Sabha TV was launched in 2006 while Rajya Sabha TV came into existence in 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-calls-for-bringing-lok-sabha-rajya-sabha-tv-under-single-body/story-GFfRNV6KiO9aNdg9AOE46J.html

25-06-2020||India||Heavy rains, bridge collapse could affect efforts to control Assam gas well fire||Flooding caused by incessant rains since Wednesday and the collapse of a bridge are hampering efforts underway to control the raging fire at a natural gas well in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district.The bridge, located on the Doomdooma-Baghjan road, nearly eight kilometres (km) from the Oil India Limited (OIL) gas well in Baghjan oilfield collapsed on Wednesday because of heavy rains that led to the flooding in the area.“The bridge is on the route of Baghjan oilfield, where the gas well that caught fire is located. It was being used to transport machinery and equipment needed to douse the fire,” said Nandita Roy Gohain, circle officer, Doomdooma.“We have provided an alternate route to ferry the equipment, but transportation work is getting affected. Flooding caused by incessant rains is a major deterrent,” she added.The gas well at Baghjan had a blowout – an uncontrolled release of gas and oil --- on May 27 during a workover operation, or major maintenance work.It caught fire on June 9, when two firefighters died and around 10,000 local residents were displaced because of the raging inferno.“The vital bridge on the main route to the well that was being used to carry heavy vehicles collapsed on Wednesday due to flooding. There are two-three alternate routes, but this was the best possible one for carrying heavy equipment,” said Tridiv Hazarika, spokesperson, OIL.“We have requested the Army to help us. They will try to erect a Bailey bridge, but that could take a week’s time. There could be some delay in the interim for the movement of heavy-loaded vehicles,” he added.On June 22, battling heavy rains and temperatures over 75 degrees Celsius, nearly 150 army personnel had constructed a Bailey bridge over a water body close to the well.Over 230 metric tonnes of material were transported over 400 km to construct the bridge, which will be used to deliver water needed to control the fire and plug the blowout.Plugging a blowout and fire in a gas or oil well require a lot of heavy equipment.On Wednesday, OIL had stated in a release that many important materials -- needed to control the fire and plug the blowout -- are still in transit from other parts of the country.“Around 80% of the vehicles, carrying heavy equipment, have reached the site. The remaining 20% are also very critical to the operation. We are facing a tremendous challenge,” said Hazarika.“There has been incessant rainfall since Wednesday night and areas near the well, which are low-lying, are inundated. Rains and flooding are creating problems and the collapse of the bridge was a major blow,” he added.Earlier, OIL authorities had stated that it would take about four weeks to plug the blowout at the gas well. Heavy rains that led to flooding, and the bridge collapse could further delay their work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/heavy-rains-bridge-collapse-could-affect-efforts-to-control-assam-gas-well-fire/story-wkAhi9Wqbhc0HMecu5BzpM.html

25-06-2020||India||Armed with BJP MP’s remarks, Congress asks PM to come clean on Chinese intrusions in Arunachal||The Congress has used the claims of a ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader about Chinese intrusions in Arunachal Pradesh to attack the government on the border standoff with China, asking Prime Minister Narendra Modi to come clean on the remarks of his party colleague.The opposition party played a video of BJP leader Tapir Gao’s speech in Lok Sabha in November 2019, when he said Chinese forces had intruded into Indian territory in his home state of Arunachal Pradesh.“But the government remained silent on the issue,” Congress spokesperson Manish Tewari told a virtual news briefing.He said Gao had claimed in a recent TV interview that China has occupied areas on both banks of Subansiri river in Arunachal Pradesh’s Upper Subansiri district and on the Indian side of the McMahon Line.“Will the prime minister and his government come clean on the claims made by the BJP MP?” Tewari asked.BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said: “Instead of resorting to a daily questionnaire for seeking media attention and for political relevance, perhaps the Congress party may wish to see how other political parties prefer reposing faith in the capabilities of the armed forces, which have been valiantly trying to protect the borders.”Following a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party has stepped up its attack on Modi and his party despite senior leader RPN Singh calling for a refrain on direct attacks on the premier. Singh was countered by other Congress leaders, who insisted that the attack should be calibrated and not by former Congress president Rahul Gandhi alone.Asked about the differences on the issue in the CWC, Tewari retorted: “Unfortunately, when speculative stories start being taken as gospel, we run the gauntlet of actually arriving at wrong conclusions. The CWC is not divided on the mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic, as to how that mishandling has crippled the Indian economy and on the question of China’s intrusion, aggression abd occupation of Indian territory. CWC is a democratic deliberative body where everybody has a right to articulate their views but there has been no dissent.”He said the same pattern was seen during the UPA government but is missing during the NDA rule.Tewari said ever since reports about Chinese incursions into Indian territory emerged, the government has been “walking the extra mile to downplay these reports and was trying to obfuscate the facts” on the ground.Flanked by party colleague and Lok Sabha member Gaurav Gogoi, he sought to know from the government if what Gao, a former Arunachal Pradesh BJP chief, was saying was right or not.“What is the truth behind what Tapir Gao is saying? There should be an immediate clarification from the government,” Tewari said.The Congress also said the government should give a “strong reply” to China as regular dialogues would not work, and use other means to take it on.Gogoi said India cannot afford to have another Doklam-like situation in Ladakh and needs to look at other forms of leverage such as trade to have successful negotiations with China.Indian and Chinese forces were engaged in a 73-day stand-off in Doklam near Sikkim in 2017 after the Indian side stopped the building of a road in the disputed area by the Chinese army.“The government should not look at what’s happening in Arunachal Pradesh or Ladakh as isolated incidents. These are grand designs and need to be responded strongly,” Gogoi said.“China needs a strong response from India, as regular dialogues won’t work. Despite all meetings, the Chinese launched a strong, premeditated attack. China has learnt one thing from the Doklam episode, that the Modi government is willing to settle for a military disengagement,” he added.Gogoi said the pattern of the Chinese army shows that they are gradually encroaching on Indian territory across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the responsibility of protecting Indian territory lies solely with the government of India.Tewari said Gao has also claimed that the army has set up another base called new Majha, deeper in Indian territory after Chinese aggressions.“We do know something with regard to Galwan Valley, Pangong lake, and Hot Springs area in the western sector, and with regard to Chinese intrusion in Naku La in the central sector. But facts continue to remain opaque on the eastern sector which is perhaps most disputed,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-with-bjp-mp-s-remarks-congress-asks-pm-to-come-clean-on-chinese-intrusions-in-arunachal/story-Kn5WhjGG21Z4Gn4myF9XfI.html

25-06-2020||India||Maharashtra: Activist moves HC, seeks postponement of elections in Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad constituencies||Mumbai: A Pune-based political activist has moved the Bombay high court (HC) seeking postponement of elections to Maharashtra legislative council for Pune, Nagpur and Aurangabad constituencies, citing poor registration of graduate and teacher voters.The petitioner, Laxman Chavan, the president of Prajasattak Bharat Paksha, has also sought a direction to the Election Commission of India (ECI) not to hold elections till at least of 50% of graduates from these constituencies are registered as voters.The public interest litigation (PIL), filed through advocateAsim Sarode, cited that on September 5, 2016, ECI had issued instructions to all chief electoral officers to make special efforts to ensure that each and every eligible voter is duly enrolled.They were ordered to facilitate the online filing of the application forms, give wide publicity to the process of revision of electoral rolls, and set up special counters for the collection of applications.They were instructed to use voter registration centres for assembly elections and also get voters enrolled for legislative councils.Chavan complained that these instructions were not followed in Maharashtra because of which the ratio of registered voters to the population of the constituencies has remained abysmally low.The petitioner gave examples in his plea to bolster his argument.Though the population of Pune graduates constituency, comprising all five districts of western Maharashtra, is 2.34 crores, including 1.94 educated people, the corresponding figure for registered voters is 3.08 lakhs, or 1.58% of the constituency’s total population, the plea stated.Similarly, in Nagpur constituency barely 1.22 lakh graduates, or 1.23% of the total population of 1.17 crores, are registered as voters.While in Aurangabad constituency the percentage of voters to the population is 2.48℅.In Aurangabad, 3.55 lakh graduates are registered as voters, even though the total population of the constituency is 1.87 crores, including 1.43 crore educated people.The PIL stated that in 2014, when elections were held in these three constituencies, 60.14% of the registered voters of Nagpur had exercised their franchise. Both Pune and Aurangabad had reported a poor turnout of 25.78℅ and 34.03℅, respectively.Chavan blamed the authorities concerned for their lack of initiative to ensure registration of graduate and teacher constituencies, despite the fact that the revision of voters’ list is always a work in progress.He cited the inordinate delay in the publication of the new electoral list, even though the terms of the members elected from the three graduate constituencies would end in July.In Maharashtra, out of the 78 members of the legislative council, 31 are elected by members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), 21 by elected representatives from local authorities, 12 are nominated by the Governor and seven each are elected by graduates and teachers from Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Konkan, Aurangabad, Nagpur, and Amravati constituencies.The PIL will come for the next hearing on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-activist-moves-hc-seeks-postponement-of-elections-in-pune-nagpur-and-aurangabad-constituencies/story-y92uGPMCcizgEkT1tG8RlM.html

Extraordinary demand!Chidambaram said that China has once again asserted their claim to the Galwan Valley in Ladakh and described it as an “extraordinary demand”. He asked if the government will now take a firm stand on restoring “status quo ante”. “Will BJP-led NDA government once again reassert India’s claim and demand that “status quo ante” must be restored?” he added. Meanwhile, the Chinese side is believed to have ramped up — its military activity along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.

In the past one week, more battalions of specialized forces trained for the Tibet theatre along with ITBP battalions have been inducted to ensure that any attempt by the bellicose PLA is foiled.Also Read: Satellite images capture China’s PLA build-up in LadakhIt is understood that Gen Naravane will also brief the political leadership about the PLA deployment and its posture along the LAC. His assessment about the PLA posture on LAC will be critical for the political leadership if the matters go south. The Army Chief will also hold discussions with Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat, Air Force and Navy chiefs on the Indian posture to be adopted in the air as well in the sea. Besides, any force requirements on the ground will be handled by Gen Rawat and the Defence Ministry. Also Watch | Army chief meets soldiers at Ladakh hospital amid China tensionWith the Chinese propaganda machine firing on all cylinders and the Indian public flooded with satellite images of the theatre duly analysed by arm chair strategists, Gen Naravane will also have to answer questions on so-called new Chinese fortifications on Galwan sector.Also Read: Army chief awards commendations to troops who fought in Galwan ValleyWhile the situation on ground remains tense in Ladakh, there have been no flare-ups on the LAC since June 22 senior military commanders meeting and a stalemate prevails in the area. Both sides are heavily deployed with the Chinese playing the “carrot and stick” move in military and diplomatic meetings.Although the Chinese diplomat in the border talks with Ministry of External Affairs blamed the Indian side for June 15 Galwan clash, fact is that this misunderstanding would have been prevented if PLA had agreed to a hotline between Indian Director General Military Operations and PLA Headquarters in Beijing. Instead of allowing a direct line to heart of Communist regime, the PLA wanted the Indian DGMO to talk to the Western Theatre Command that controls Tibet and Xinjiang province.Also Read: China finally admits casualties in Galwan clash, claims ‘numbers not very high’With significant force deployment on the front and in depth areas, it is evident that PLA wants to drive Indian Army to the wall and precipitate a crisis by continuously blaming India for Galwan flare-up.

25-06-2020||India||Amit Shah’s jibe at Congress: ‘Why does the Emergency mindset remain?’||Union home minister Amit Shah asked a few questions to Congress and gave some advice to the Opposition party which has been attacking the government over various issues like India-China face-off and fuel price hike.“As one of India’s opposition parties, Congress needs to ask itself: Why does the Emergency mindset remain? Why are leaders who don’t belong to 1 dynasty unable to speak up? Why are leaders getting frustrated in Congress? Else, their disconnect with people will keep widening,” he tweeted on Thursday. As one of India’s opposition parties, Congress needs to ask itself:Why does the Emergency mindset remain?Why are leaders who don’t belong to 1 dynasty unable to speak up?Why are leaders getting frustrated in Congress?Else, their disconnect with people will keep widening.He indirectly targeted the Gandhi family by talking about the dynasty and claimed that leaders in the Congress are getting frustrated.Shah’s tweet comes a day after Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Jagat Prakash Nadda’s blistering attack in the Congress and the Gandhi family for questioning the government’s stand on June 15 face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh. He said that “a rejected and ejected dynasty is not equal to the entire Opposition”.“One ‘royal’ dynasty and their ‘loyal’ courtiers have grand delusions of the Opposition being about one dynasty. A dynast throws tantrums and his courtiers peddle that fake narrative. Latest one relates to the Opposition asking questions to the Government,” Nadda said on Twitter on Wednesday.He called it the Opposition’s right to ask questions and added healthy deliberations took place at the all-party meeting over the face-off in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. Nadda added several opposition leaders gave their valuable inputs at the meeting. “They also fully supported the Centre in determining the way ahead. One family was an exception. Any guesses who?” Nadda said in another tweet.He added “a time rejected and ejected dynasty is NOT equal” to the entire Opposition.The Congress hit back and reminded Nadda of the BJP’s “conduct” as an opposition party until 2014. “BJP should not hide behind the army. The BJP should look back at its conduct when it attacked the government on delicate foreign policy issues during the UPA rule,” Congress spokesman Manish Tewari said on Wednesday.The war of words has been going on between the BJP and the Congress over the June 15 skirmish in the Ladakh region in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. The Congress has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of giving away Indian territory to China.PM Modi had asserted at the all-party meeting that “no one has entered our territory, no one is at present within our territory and no one has occupied our posts”. This was in reference to the situation in the Galwan Valley after Indian Army’s brave action to thwart Chinese attempts to erect a structure on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-s-jibe-at-congress-why-does-the-emergency-mindset-remain/story-OXQCbLjIcXChSuUTYndYaP.html

Gupta is former managing director of real estate company Emaar MGF.The officials said that Gupta’s premises were searched to look for evidence of money laundering in the Rs 3,727 crore scam. The action is being taken under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), they added.Gupta or his spokesperson could not be located for comments by the ED during raids. He was earlier questioned by the ED in 2016.Gupta is currently the promoter of realty firm MGF.Emaar, meanwhile, issued a statement saying Gupta has no role in the company. “Emaar and MGF had parted ways few years back and Mr Shravan Gupta has no role in Emaar India and is also no longer on the Board of the Company. Emaar India is directly under the control of its parent Emaar Properties PJSC, Dubai, and is fully in compliance with rules and regulations of the law of the land. As a responsible corporate, Emaar India will cooperate with any government agency.”Officials believe Gupta had links with European middleman Guido Haschke, who played a key role in bringing the bribe money to India. Haschke was reportedly a director on the board of Emaar-MGF in 2009.The officials said that the fresh action against the businessman has come about after certain revelations made by an accused in the case and some fresh evidence obtained by the agency.The ED slapped money laundering charges in this case following allegations of irregularities in purchase of 12 VVIP choppers from Italy-based Finmeccanica’s British subsidiary AgustaWestland. The deal was scrapped by India in 2014.The agency had seized Gupta’s assets worth Rs 10.28 crore in 2018 on charges of allegedly holding undisclosed deposits in a Swiss bank account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agustawestland-vvip-chopper-case-ed-raids-on-businessman-shravan-gupta/story-gsQ9W5sXBmK9HQm13Nm5PK.html

In his address via video conference on the occasion of the Passport Seva Divas, Jaishankar also said the government intends to open a Post Office Passport Seva Kendra in every Lok Sabha constituency. “We have so far been able to provide for 488 Lok Sabha constituencies,” he said. That process has stopped on account of the Covid-19 pandemic, but it will move forward as the lockdown eases up, he said. Jaishankar said his ministry is working with Indian Security Press, Nashik, and National Informatics Centre for chip-enabled e-passports with advanced security features. “I am very confident that the introduction of e-passports will greatly strengthen the security of our travel documents. I understand that the procurement process for its production is currently underway and I would emphasise the need to hasten that as much as possible,” he said. “I emphasise that it is necessary to roll out the manufacture of e-passports on a priority basis,” Jaishankar said. He said the focus must be on how to simplify the rules and processes without compromising legitimate security concerns which are at the heart of the reforms being undertaken by the government. “We have seen a complete transformation in the passport delivery service especially over the last six years,” he said. More than 1.22 crore passports were issued during 2019 by the Passport Issuing Authorities (PIA) in India and abroad, the Ministry of External Affairs said in a statement. The total number of Passport Kendras functioning in the country is 517, comprising 93 Passport Seva Kendras (PSK) and 424 Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSK), it said. Jaishankar said the focus of MEA would be to further strengthen the outreach efforts to take passport services closer to the people by opening more POPSKs in the country. As a part of the global outreach exercise, MEA has integrated the passport issuance systems in 70 Missions and Posts abroad issuing more than 95 per cent of the passports abroad. Initiatives such as mPassport police and mPassport seva apps had led to improvements in systems and customer satisfaction, Jaishankar said. In his message on the occasion, Jaishankar also said MEA has incorporated greater use of IT and digital systems into its functioning including delivering public services. Minister of State for External Affairs V Muraleedharan, in his remarks, highlighted the efforts of all the Passport Issuing Authorities in India and abroad who are working to ensure transparent and efficient passport delivery systems for the benefit of citizens. Passport Seva Puraskars were announced for the best performing Passport Offices and the personnel of the service provider. The Passport Seva Divas is observed to commemorate the enactment of the Passports Act on June 24, 1967.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chip-enabled-e-passports-will-strengthen-security-of-travel-documents-s-jaishankar/story-NZjTnJ62cPZgMW0zsbFRAO.html

We have discharged them and declared them fit for home quarantine. But their family members are refusing to take them to their residences,” he said.He said many from among these 50 patients have waited outside the hospital for hours. “When no one from their families came to take them, we re-admitted them back to the hospital and provide them beds to stay. There are two age groups in these patients,” Dr Rao added.He said they have kept the group in the higher age bracket in Gandhi Hospital and the other group of people aged around 50 years has been shifted to Nature Cure Hospital. “Their families are also asking us to do testing to make sure that they are negative. In this critical situation doing tests repeatedly is not possible,” he said.Dr Rao cited the case of a 93-year-old Covid-19 positive woman, who was admitted to Gandhi Hospital 15 days ago and is now fine and fit to get discharged from the hospital.He said her family members are not coming forward to take her to their residence and she is in hospital.In another case, an 85-year-old-person, who tested positive and got admitted to Gandhi Hospital 16 days ago, is now having no symptoms and is fit for home quarantine.“But his family members are refusing to take him to their residence and are demanding a re-test, Dr Rao said.Gandhi Hospital is the designated nodal centre in Telangana to treat Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kin-of-over-50-recovered-covid-19-patients-in-hyderabad-refuse-to-take-them-back-home/story-i2sWoMFblxnt5Yssa9makJ.html

25-06-2020||India||Delhiwale: A woman and her balconies||The coronavirus pandemic has forced many of us to self-exile within our house. This makes one finally appreciate what one always took for granted—ambling along the streets, shoving and pushing in the Metro, pressing floor buttons without a fright in the office lift, or kissing the cheeks of random friends and acquaintances in evening cocktails. But staying inside for long stretches has also made people feel the preciousness of something that they can still safely cherish—the humble window or balcony in the house.To many, the window/balcony has grown to be a most risk-proof link to the world immediately outside the home. Instagram these days is filled up with window-side selfies. Some weeks ago, dance instructor Asavari Joshi, a Gurugram dweller, snapped a stunning picture of a barn owl perched outside her apartment window on the 21st floor. This week photographer Ram Rahman shared a portrait of Mr Budmash Khan, his cat, perched by a window at their apartment in Delhi’s Civil Lines.And, dear home-bound reader, you must also consider the outdoorsy aspects in the life of Savita, a housekeeper who lives in a Gurugram condo with a family of five. This spacious dwelling feels totally distanced from ground realities—it is on the 30th floor. The apartment has three bedrooms, but only two windows (!), and one of them doesn’t count for it’s in the so-called “store room” and opens to a boring view of the service staircase, aka the fire exit. The other window is in the “guest room” that remains screened off with a blind for safety reasons “because that is where chhoti sleeps,” Savita says, affectionately referring to the only child in the house whom she also calls Sam/Samairaa/ Shona.The apartment compensates for the windows with three balconies. Two of them are moderately expansive and the third in the kitchen is very small. Savita calls it the utility balcony. “We use this one for drying the laundry and to keep our mops and buckets,” says one of the household members with whom Savita lives. Both ladies are chatting with this reporter on WhatsApp video, the pictures are taken through the mobile screen. During the early minutes of the conversation, Savita is overcome with intense shyness; every response of hers is laced with blushes and smiles. She however quickly recovers her bearings and goes on to give a survey of the kitchen balcony—it faces residential towers exactly similar to the one from where she speaks. This balcony keeps the kitchen flooded with daylight, and lights aren’t needed until the sundown, Savita informs.Since the lockdown began in late March, the regular gardener (the appropriately named Phool Chand) is no longer coming to the house to look after the balcony foliage. Savita has taken up his role instead. She crosses a room to the other balcony—currently occupied by a clothes drying stand—and shows the potted plants bearing pudina, ajwain, kari patta and tulsi respectively.Keeping her arms on the balustrade, Savita silently stares into the air in front of her, and the earth below. “So green, so many trees,” she mutters. It’s dizzy to look at the great drop even through the phone screen but Savita says she isn’t afraid of heights.In the winter, if it’s nicely sunny, she often likes to have her lunch in the balcony, she says.Responding to a query, Savita reveals that she hasn’t stepped out of the apartment since the pandemic hijacked the daily headlines. Which means her feet haven’t touched the ground for more than two months. This makes Savita like a modern-day Rapunzel stranded at the top of a tower. Especially because just like that fairy tale heroine, her hair are very long— cascading down “almost” to her knees. Covering her face with her hand to shield a suddenly emerging smile, Savita admits she doesn’t miss stepping out of the apartment as she would often do in the BC (Before Corona) era. Indeed, her calm demeanour suggests a satisfactory compromise with this new quarantined style of living.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-a-woman-and-her-balconies/story-TyomCLiY4XsbEhbh2nh14H.html
25-06-2020||India||Pinjra Tod activist Natasha Narwal’s plea cites jail violence||There was “large-scale violence” inside jail number six meant for women prisoners in Tihar prison complex and officials, who allegedly beat up some foreign inmates on June 16, were also intimidating Pinjra Tod activist Natasha Narwal lodged there, her lawyer, Adit S Pujari, told the Delhi high court on Wednesday.Pujari said a “lockdown” has been imposed in the jail since the alleged violence. None of the inmates were being allowed to make phone calls, he said. Pujari said Narwal, who was arrested in March for her alleged role in the Delhi riots and has been charged under the UAPA, informed him about the violence via video conferencing. The court has sought a status report by Friday in response to Narwal’s plea seeking video conferencing facilities to consult her lawyer. Meanwhile, the high court has denied bail to Shahrukh Pathan, accused of pointing a pistol at a police head constable during the violence, saying his intention was to become a hero and he would have to face the law. Justice Suresh Kumar Kait allowed Pathan’s counsel, advocate Asghar Khan, to withdraw the bail plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pinjra-tod-activist-natasha-narwal-s-plea-cites-jail-violence/story-7SYfgxS3VkgcaJ8eKgZ8KK.html
25-06-2020||India||Covid-19: Lack of clarity on firm may hurt monitoring||Monitoring home isolation of Covid cases requires specialised teams experienced in remote and residential patient care services, government officials and experts said on Wednesday as uncertainty persisted over whether a private company that has been carrying out this task in the national capital will be allowed to continue.The company, Portea Medical, was caught in a tussle between the Delhi government and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, who – as head of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority – scrapped the contract citing lack of due process. The reasoning has been strongly rejected by the Aam Aadmi Party government that said the arrangement was made following central guidelines that allow for expediting of such processes in emergency situations like a pandemic.“The Disaster Management Act specifically allows the Centre and state governments battling disasters and epidemics to procure goods and services without following the time-consuming tendering process, using a nomination route,” a Delhi government spokesperson said on Wednesday, adding that timeliness of decisions was “most crucial to ensure lives are saved”. “Even to procure services though nomination route, there is a due process which was followed in this case,” the spokesperson added. According to data from government officials and comments made by grassroots medical staff, the task of following up with home isolation cases requires phone calls to all active patients recuperating at their residence – a role that needs dedicated teams. “Given the scale of the pandemic and keeping in mind our existing health infrastructure, it is not possible for the health workers to call every home isolation patient every day and advice them on best practices,” a government official said, asking not to be named. Portea’s contract was cancelled on June 19 but the company was allowed to carry on follow-ups with 10,490 active home isolation cases it had been handling at the time. Since then, this number has grown by at least 4,000 and these new cases now need to be followed up by staff under the district surveillance officer (DSO) for whom the task is in addition to the containment and contact tracing responsibilities. Two DSOs said their work load has increased manifolds since June 20, when the old guidelines were changed. “First we are supposed to get the list of those testing positive in our district from the respective medical offices. Once we have the list we start visiting the homes of asymptomatic and mild patients for their clinical assessment and also to check their home for elibility, if needed. Now our teams have been asked to also make follow up calls to all home quarantine patients. We are managing with whatever little staff we have and sometimes calling one patient twice a day is not possible,” one of these officers said, asking not to be named.The other officer added that they are also now fielding an increasing number of calls since cases are going up.According to the Delhi health bulletin, there were 14,844 – or 56% of the city’s active cases – in home isolation on Wednesday.“Suddenly, there is excessive burden on district surveillance officers and that can have a negative impact on Covid management efforts. Surveillance and management of home isolation cases require very specific training in the fields of data collection, data management and creating a quick response mechanism. Not all surveillance officers are experts on all fields. So, having an additional support system for this job is recommended,” said Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital.In a statement, Portea detailed the scope of the work involved with home isolation, saying a comprehensive tracking system “involving government doctors and experts from Portea” monitored patients for the entire mandated isolation period of 17 days.“Portea also submits regular reports on their condition flagging off any health complications. If required, the company arranges for a teleconsultation with Delhi government doctors using its technology platform. For cases where hospitalisation may be needed, Portea notifies the appropriate government agency for action on the ground,” it said, adding that it also handled identification of patients who can leave home isolation.According to government data, of the 16,301 patients enrolled by the company, about 3% required hospitalisation – and 0.1% among them succumbed.“To blame the process or an agency is clearly an afterthought by the LG and central government to justify a poorly taken decision that was quickly reversed after widespread criticism by the media, citizens, RWAs,” the government official quoted above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-lack-of-clarity-on-firm-may-hurt-monitoring/story-fVVLN63AzMWa5Rf5d4IMXL.html
25-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Six months into the year, there’s a lot we have learnt about Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19 (the coronavirus disease), and there’s a lot we have learnt about the disease itself.We know that it is highly infective, we know how it spreads, and we know who is most at risk. By “we”, I mean most people who have bothered to learn more about the only thing the world has been bothered with for six months (caveat: top tennis players may or may not be part of the “we”). ON THE RISEThe pandemic is showing no signs of slowing. It is finding new hot spots in countries hitherto unaffected by it and even within countries already ravaged by it. No one knows how long it will last; no one knows when it will peak; and no one knows the final toll.Companies and researchers around the world are racing towards developing a vaccine in record time — there are many candidates in the works, and there’s a general consensus that one will be ready by next year, perhaps the shortest time in which a vaccine for a major disease has been developed.Also Read: Oxford vaccine against Covid-19 in final stage of clinical trialsThere have been around 9.2 million cases of Covid-19 in the world until now; and almost half a million (477,000+) people have died from the viral disease. The pandemic is showing no signs of slowing. It is finding new hot spots in countries hitherto unaffected by it, and, even within countries already ravaged by it, in parts previously untouched.No one knows how long it will last; no one knows when it will peak; and no one knows the final toll. To paraphrase a sentiment that has been expressed by enough scientists and administrators: there is no point in talking of a second wave because we are still in the midst of the first. Indeed, there’s been no ebb and flow of cases at the global level — just one continuous rise.6 MONTHS ON Even as health care systems around the world have been overwhelmed by the rush of cases in the six months since the outbreak began, it is remarkable that doctors have figured out a way to treat an entirely new virus using treatments and medicines that are old, tested, and, more importantly, with which they are comfortable.India ended June 23 with 455,928 cases and 14,482 deaths (a case fatality rate of 3.17%), but it has also seen 258,544 recoveries (which translates into a recovery rate of 57%). Going by the current case fatality rate, many of the active cases can be expected to recover.And, in India, and around the world, that’s the biggest hope as we near the end of June. The virus has proved strangely resilient — not weakening as others before it have, resulting in infections tapering off, almost on their own — and summer has had no effect on it, but even as health care systems and professionals around the world have been overwhelmed by the rush of cases, they have figured out how to treat Covid-19.AVAILABLE TREATMENTSMany of the prophylactics and treatments for Covid-19 are surprisingly low-tech. Quarantines, masks and hand washing are not hi-tech. Nor is the malaria medicine. Similarly, oxygen has been used in the field of medicine since the 18th century, and dexamethasone since the 20th century. New-age medicines too are being used or clinically tested.Many of the prophylactics and cures are surprisingly low-tech. Quarantines, masks and hand washing are not hi-tech. Nor is the malaria medicine which India’s apex medical body thinks is a good prophylactic. Oxygen, which has emerged a vital part of the therapy for Covid has been used in the field of medicine since the late 18th century, with the first cylinders making their appearance in the middle of the 19th (and home oxygen concentrators, which many people are buying, in the 1970s). Also Read: WHO’s Tedros expects world to hit 10 million coronavirus cases next weekDexamethasone, the steroid which has shown remarkable results in seriously ill patients on ventilators and oxygen support, has been around since the middle of the 20th century, as have the first modern ventilators themselves, although the use of mechanical support for breathing dates much further back. And convalescent plasma therapy, considered by many to be a fail-safe treatment for the critically ill, was first used in the late 19th century.Experimental and new-age medicines — remdesivir, which seems to work very well on moderately ill patients if given early in the course of the infection, is one — are also being used or, at the least, clinically tested. But it is remarkable that doctors have figured out a way to treat an entirely new virus using treatments and medicines that are old, tested, and, more importantly, with which they are comfortable.Six months into the pandemic, there’s something to be thankful for, and there’s something to be hopeful about.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-TDtmJnEfXhw4E4TK36iYEN.html

25-06-2020||India||Telangana Police Academy chief seeks premature retirement||Senior Indian Police Service officer and director of Telangana State Police Academy Vinoy Kumar Singh on Wednesday announced his resignation saying he does not want to be “burden on the government”.In his letter to Union home secretary, a copy of which was marked to Telangana chief secretary Somesh Kumar, the 1987-batch IPS officer said he was seeking premature retirement from the service with effect from October 2, coinciding with the birth anniversary of Mahatma Gandhi.He said he had joined the police department as a regular recruit in the Telangana cadre with great hopes to change the police system but he thought he had failed in his ambitions.“The Telangana government has also not been much impressed with my services. My advice to better the services in the government also did not cut much ice. Perhaps, my opinion was not considered worth it. I have my considered opinion that I should not be a burden on the government and the government, too, should not be burdened with worthless people,” Singh said.The IPS officer said after retirement, he would like to work for reforms among the people and service to Telangana. “So, I decided to opt for pre-mature retirement,” he said.Stating that he had nothing against any government, Singh thanked the Telangana government “for the best treatment” it had given to him.Sources close to Singh said he was upset at being denied promotion to the rank of Director General of Police. On May 21, too, he had written a letter to the chief secretary requesting that he be promoted to the DGP rank in accordance with the seniority and eligibility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-police-academy-chief-seeks-premature-retirement/story-Kk5bVr1Z5fDaCTUycRMX9K.html
25-06-2020||India||Understanding coronavirus and learning to live through the pandemic||It has now been six months since Sars-CoV-2, which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), first emerged. Within this short span of time, our knowledge about the virus, how it infects people, and what we must do to prevent it, has evolved dramatically. Here’s a ready reckoner on the disease.SOURCES AND PROTECTIONDoes it transmit over surfaces?Contaminated surfaces such as doorknobs, grab rails, table tops or cash were once considered as potential sites of contamination. It now appears that fomite transmission – as this is called – is actually rare and not the primary mode of transmission, as per the United States’ Centres for Disease Control and Prevention. This largely has to do with how the outer, spiked covering of the virus that it uses to infect human cells, which can easily get destroyed. But a large load of virus deposited on a surface, say after an infected person has sneezed, makes it risky to touch.Do masks and face shields help?Yes. The primary source of infection is through infected droplets when people speak, cough or sneeze. Wearing a mask – even a non-medical face covering -- reduces the possibility of inhaling the infected droplets quite significantly. Masks with an exhalation valve – something anti-pollution masks usually have – aren’t that effective.The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommends that vulnerable people should wear a medical-grade mask and doctors should wear face shields since they are prone to being exposed to the virus, which can also be absorbed by the body through the membrane in the eyes. How does washing hands help?Hand-washing six to 10 times a day lowers the risk by 36% compared to those who wash them less than five times a day, a University College London study found. When water is not available, clean hands with alcohol-based hand rubs (with over 70% alcohol content).However, even when properly done and combined with sanitising, this doesn’t offer complete protection, according to a review of 172 studies from 16 countries published in The Lancet on June 2.Where should we be most careful?Recently, the Lancet Infectious Diseases journal found that the virus spreads readily among household contacts even when someone is yet to develop symptoms. Other risky settings include generally closed, indoor spaces – gyms, offices and restaurants, for instance – with hospitals and care homes being the most dangerous, since they are likely to be visited by infected people. But some factors could help: being at distance in a large space that is well-ventilated cuts the risk.Does this mean that it is less risky outdoors?Possibly, but several ambient factors determine how far an infected droplet can go. Breeze, wind and air streams play a factor, and can theoretically transport them to longer distances. A good comparison is exhaled cigarette smoke, which a person is less likely to smell outdoors than in a closed room since diffusion happens more readily in the open. The sun’s ultraviolet rays too can inactivate the virus. But being close to an infected person in any setting – indoor or outdoor – is not ideal, thereby making social distancing crucial.When does an infected person become infectious?The incubation period, which is the time between exposure to Sars-CoV-2 and becoming infected with it, is on average five to six days, but has also been found to be as long as 14 days. Infected people start becoming infectious before symptoms manifest. Studies show that they are most contagious one to two days before they begin to feel ill. There is no documented evidence on when asymptomatic people start infecting others.Can those without symptoms infect you?It appears to be so. A study of pairs of people in which one person definitely got infected from the other showed that about 44% of Covid-19 cases spread from person to person before symptoms appeared. This mirrors another study in which researchers isolated infectious virus from patients and found that it was produced before symptoms began to manifest. This nature of this virus makes it particularly difficult to stop – asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic cases make the tracing and isolation of people even harder.If there is a cluster near your house, are you more at risk?If there are multiple cases in a neighbourhood, the odds of pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic people spreading infection when they meet others increases.However, staying quarantined and using precautions like social distancing and wearing masks reduces risk.DETECTING AN ILLNESSWhen should you get tested?Symptomatic people test positive more readily. Asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case should be tested between day 5 and day 10 of coming into contact with an infected person. Tests have to be done during a specific period to ensure there are no false negative results.But no specific timeline has been identified since many can still throw up false negatives while having symptoms.What are the tests used for diagnosis?Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has approved what is known as the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction or RT-PCR test to detect genetic material (nucleic acid) of Sars-CoV-2 using swabs from the nose and throat of a person. It diagnoses an existing infection, so a negative result does not indicate you won’t get infected later. This is the gold standard test.However, false negative results may occur, as was the case with Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, if the sample is collected very early in the infection.Last week, ICMR approved rapid antigen tests to detect current infection. Antigen tests, which take less than 30 minutes for results, check for protein signatures related to a Sars-Cov-2 infection. A third type of test, antibody tests, see if someone has virus-fighting antibodies, the ones used so far have not been reliable. How long after an infection do you test negative?Most people with mild disease are no longer contagious 10 days after symptoms, and three additional days without symptoms, according to the WHO criteria for all Covid-19 cases, regardless of isolation location or disease severity. Patients who are asymptomatic can end isolation 10 days after testing positive for Sars-CoV-2.But there are outliers, such as a patient with mild Covid-19 in China who remained PCR-positive for 63 days after symptoms. It is unclear whether this posed a transmission risk.NATURE OF ILLNESSWho is most at risk?Data from across the world shows severe disease and death rates are higher in people over the age of 65, living in nursing homes or long-term care facilities and with underlying medical conditions, such as chronic lung disease, asthma, heart conditions, obesity, diabetes, kidney disease, and liver disease. Risk is also high for people with compromised immunity because of cancer treatment, smoking, transplantation, immune deficiencies, prolonged use of corticosteroids and other immune weakening medications. Fatality rates seen across the world show men are more vulnerable than women.But infection can happen in anyone, including healthy people and children who can go on to develop fatal complications. Are children and babies relatively safer?Relatively few cases of babies with Covid-19 have been reported, and those who are infected have experienced mild illness, according to WHO. Children are 56% less likely than adults to get infected when in contact with an infected person, but how easily they pass on the infection to others is unclear. In the US and China, children under 18 years account for around 2% of diagnosed cases. But there have been widespread reports of children and adolescents developing a multisystem inflammatory condition similar to the Kawasaki disease and toxic shock syndrome. Such cases would need intensive care.When are you likely to show symptoms?Symptoms usually appear 2-14 days after exposure to the virus, and may range from mild to severe, depending on the extent of exposure and the health of the person. Most common symptoms are fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty in breathing, which may be accompanied by fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, loss of taste or smell, nausea or diarrhoea.What happens if you have mild or no symptoms?Around four in five people have mild illness and can recover at home without medical care. They need to stay isolated at home for two weeks to prevent spreading the infection to others around them.When should you seek medical attention?Emergency warning signs for Covid-19: trouble breathing, persistent pain or pressure in the chest, confusion, inability to wake or stay awake, and bluish lips or face.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/understanding-coronavirus-and-learning-to-live-through-the-pandemic/story-BelRF1gB1cbm6fGZfqW2xM.html
25-06-2020||India||China’s mixed signals after deal to disengage||India and China on Wednesday said the speedy implementation of disengagement and de-escalation measures agreed on by their senior military commanders will help calm tensions triggered by an ongoing border standoff.However, the strains and pressure simmering beneath the surface were evident in Beijing’s reiteration of accusations that New Delhi had violated bilateral agreements and provoked the June 15 clash in Galwan Valley that resulted in the death of 20 Indian soldiers and unspecified Chinese casualties.During a more than three-hour meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs, the Indian side conveyed its concerns on developments in eastern Ladakh, including the violent face-off on June 15, and emphasised both sides should “strictly respect and observe” the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The stance adopted by both sides indicated the ongoing military and diplomatic engagements to end the standoff, especially in Galwan Valley, which has been the focus of tensions, will be a long-drawn affair with no early resolution in sight.The meeting of WMCC, held via video conference, focused on developments along the disputed border, especially the situation in eastern Ladakh, the external affairs ministry said in a statement. The Chinese readout of the meeting described the talks as “candid” and “in-depth”.The two sides referred to the June 17 phone conversation between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi and the meeting of the corps commanders on June 22 and “reaffirmed that both sides should sincerely implement the understanding on disengagement and de-escalation that was reached by the Senior [military] Commanders on 6th June”, the Indian statement said.“The two delegations agreed that implementation of this understanding expeditiously, in accordance with the bilateral agreements and protocols, would help ensure peace and tranquillity in border areas and the development of broader relationship between the two countries,” the statement added.The Chinese readout said the two sides will “actively accommodate with the two military forces to implement the outcome reached during the two rounds of commander-level meetings on June 6 and 22... strengthen communication and coordination through military and diplomatic channels, and peacefully resolve relevant issues in the border areas through bilateral dialogue and consultation”. It also spoke of strengthening military confidence-building measures.This was the second meeting of the WMCC since June 5, and the Indian side was led by joint secretary (East Asia) Naveen Srivastava of the external affairs ministry, while the Chinese side was headed by director general Hong Liang of the department of boundary affairs of the foreign ministry.People familiar with developments on condition of anonymity said the meeting also discussed possible contours of future diplomatic engagements and parameters for taking forward the measures agreed on by military commanders to ease tensions. “This is going to be a protracted process and we have to be ready for the long haul,” said one of the people cited above. The two sides will maintain communications at the diplomatic and military levels, including through WMCC, to resolve the situation peacefully. But even as the meeting was underway, China’s defence and foreign ministry kept up a shrill barrage of accusations against India, blaming the Indian side for the Galwan Valley clash and alleging the external affairs ministry was behind “false reports”.The allegations came two days after the corps commanders of the two sides reached “mutual consensus to disengage” in all “friction areas” along the LAC. People familiar with the military talks too said the process is expected to be arduous and completed in phases.China’s defence and foreign ministry separately castigated India for allegedly violating bilateral agreements and provoking the clash. There was also a reiteration of a claim of sovereignty over Galwan Valley. India has already dismissed these allegations and said the contested valley has always been under its control.Asked why China’s foreign ministry was repeating these contentious points amid renewed talks of peace and tranquillity on the border, spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a news briefing: “What I have just said…is meant to clarify the whole situation, tell the truth to everyone. We made the statement because the [external affairs ministry] and Indian media have made some false reports.”In a statement read out after the briefing was over, Zhao repeated accusations that Indian troops had trespassed into Chinese territory and provoked an incident on May 6. He claimed the Indian side had agreed to withdraw from Galwan Valley and had “dismantled its facilities as requested by the Chinese side”.Referring to the corps commanders meeting of June 6, Zhao contended the Indian side had committed it would not “trespass” into Galwan Valley for “patrol and for building”. The two sides agreed to set up observation posts on both sides of the Galwan river estuary, but “the Indian side went against these agreements and asked China to dismantle China’s posts and also it crossed the [LAC] to provoke which led to the clash”, he added.Zhao also reiterated China’s accusation that the June 15 clash occurred because Indian troops went against the agreement reached on June 6 and “crossed the LAC and sabotaged the tents Chinese side set up”. He also alleged the Indian side attacked Chinese personnel – such accusations have been dismissed by India, which has maintained the “premeditated and planned” actions of the Chinese side led to the violence and casualties.Separately, China’s defence ministry spokesperson Wu Qian made similar accusations during an online interaction with selected media.Analysts questioned the divergent positions taken by the Chinese side during bilateral discussions and while making public remarks on the border stand-off.Leading strategic analyst Brahma Chellaney tweeted: “In keeping with China’s standard playbook for camouflaging offence as defence, its foreign ministry almost daily has been branding India as the aggressor. But today, its foreign and defence ministries launched twin attacks on India. Is the ‘disengagement’ deal already unravelling?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-mixed-signals-after-deal-to-disengage/story-lSmLKBpGcIdCQsMMdqLT7N.html
25-06-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi slams Centre over Covid, rising fuel prices||A day after the Congress announced that it will organise a nationwide campaign against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over increasing fuel prices, former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday drew a parallel between rising cases of the coronavirus disease and prices of petrol and diesel.On Wednesday, fuel retailers raised diesel price for the 18th day in a row by 48 paise per litre, making it costlier than petrol for the first time. Retailers, however, hit the pause button on petrol prices after hiking them for 17 days on the trot.“The Modi government has ‘unlocked’ the corona pandemic and prices of petrol-diesel,” Gandhi tweeted in Hindi and also tagged a graph captioned, “coronavirus is not the only rising curve”. The graph showed a steady rise in the daily Covid-19 cases and prices of petrol and diesel after the lockdown was relaxed on June 1 with the start of Unlock One. Pump prices of petroleum have risen by Rs.8.5 per litre since June 7. Diesel prices have increased by Rs 10.49 per litre in 18 days.The Congress has been attacking the government over the continuous increase in petrol and diesel prices after the lockdown restrictions were relaxed. In Delhi, diesel is being sold at Rs 79.88 per litre while petrol is priced at Rs 79.76 a litre. Retail prices of the two fuels differ from city to city because of variations in local levies.Executives at state-run oil marketing companies said the main reason for a spike in petrol and diesel prices were high central and state levies that had been imposed when global oil prices were very low.The central government raised excise duties on petrol and diesel twice – first by Rs 3 per litre each, and later by Rs 10 a litre on petrol and Rs 13 on diesel. A Re-1 per litre hike in excuse duty means an additional revenue of Rs 14,500 crore to the exchequer in a year.States have also raised value-added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel since mid-March. The Delhi government raised VAT on petrol and diesel to 30% last month; consequently, retail prices of petrol in the state jumped by Rs 1.67 per litre and diesel by Rs 7.10 a litre.Earlier, state levies on petrol and diesel were 27% and 16.75%, respectively. Diesel in Delhi also attracts an additional Rs 250 per kilolitre air ambience charge.The ministries of petroleum and finance, and state-run oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corp (IOC), Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) and Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) did not respond to queries on the matter.Domestic consumers have suffered a sustained spike in petrol and diesel rates as global oil prices started moving north after the producers’ cartel, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and its allies, particularly Russia (together OPEC+), on June 6 decided to extend record output cuts by one more month till the end of July.Also on Wednesday, the country witnessed the highest single-day jump of 15,968 Covid-19 cases and 465 fatalities, taking the case tally to 456,183 and the death toll to 14,476, according to the Union health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-slams-centre-over-covid-rising-fuel-prices/story-Ux3COTPnyiPnqzWDR3OPfI.html
25-06-2020||India||West Bengal extends lockdown till July 31||Chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday extended the lockdown in West Bengal -- now effectively limited to coronavirus containment zones -- until July 31 because of the continuing increase in Covid-19 cases. Banerjee also said many lives could have been saved had private hospitals provided better treatment to coronavirus disease patients with comorbid conditions.“We could have saved a few more lives if they were given some better treatment. Private hospitals focused on Covid-19 treatments and neglected the comorbid condition like cardiac problems and kidney problems in Covid patients. As a result some people died. I am sorry to say. The government is sending instruction to the hospitals in this regard,” Banerjee said after an all-party meeting held at the state secretariat on Wednesday.At least 591 people have died in the state out of which 437 or nearly 74% had comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease and kidney ailments, among others. “When a critical cardiac patient with Covid-19 is coming you should first attend to his cardiac problems. Later you can attend to his Covid problems,” Banerjee added. She also told reporters that the lockdown will continue until July 31, noting that Covid-19 cases were still rising and adding that most political parties favoured an extension. West Bengal this month relaxed lockdown curbs along with other parts of the country. The restrictions are now enforced primarily in containment zones with relaxations given to shops, offices, religious institutions and public transport in other places. She said the state would request the NITI Aayog to formulate a master plan for the protection and development of the Sunderbans, home to more than four million people and around 100 tigers. The region was hit by cyclone Amphan on May 20. “All parties have raised the issue of Sunderbans which is repeatedly being devastated by cyclones. We will request NITI Aayog to send down a team and formulate a master plan and a permanent solution. The help of the World Bank can also be taken,” she added.An all-party committee, with state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee as its head, has been formed, to look into the relief and restoration work in the aftermath of cyclone Amphan that affected around 100 million people in the state.“We had given some suggestions in the meeting. Let the government take actions on those suggestions. It is too early to say whether we are happy with the outcome of the meeting,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party’s West Bengal unit. There have been allegations of corruption in cyclone relief work against the ruling Trinamool Congress in several villages. Angry villagers recently staged protests in many cyclone-hit areas and ransacked government offices. “I have instructed the chief secretary and the district administrations that no genuine cyclone victim should be deprived of the relief. Some of our panchayat leaders and members have been ousted. We won’t tolerate any corruption,” Banerjee added.Communist Party of India (Marxist) state secretary Surya Kanta Mishra said: “There are certain gaps which need to be plugged, particularly in the health care sector. We have given our suggestions to the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-extends-lockdown-till-july-31/story-cCjKVw7EPQQmHi21oAWhEO.html
25-06-2020||India||Patanjali’s ‘breakthrough’ needs vetting, say experts||India’s traditional systems of medicine, including ayurveda, have several proven preventive and curative drugs and therapies, but Patanjali Ayurved Ltd’s claim of a breakthrough cure for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) needs vetting, experts said, despite the company claiming to have conducted a randomised placebo-controlled clinical trial.The principal investigator running the clinical trial at a Jaipur medical college confirmed the findings but said they were preliminary and the study, ongoing. He also clarified that the study was conducted on patients who were asymptomatic or had mild symptoms, between the ages of 35 and 45, and that no people with co-morbidities (considered the most vulnerable to the disease) were part of the trial.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Interestingly, a spokesperson for Patanjali, SK Tijarawala said that the company never “claimed that it (the medicines) were a cure for coronavirus disease; all we said was that the medicines in our kit that Patanjali has been selling individually to boost immunity and provide relief to patients of respiratory illness has been effective in improving symptoms of Covid-19 patients”. Patanjali submitted (preliminary) results of the clinical trial to the ministry of Ayush (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) only after the latter demanded ”facts of the claim and details of the stated scientific study”. That came after the company, promoted by yoga guru Baba Ramdev, went public with its discovery. He was later interviewed by several TV channels where he talked up the discovery. The scientific title of its clinical trial, according to documents submitted by the company is : Impact of Indian traditional Ayurvedic treatment regime for nCov-2 (Covid-19)Click here for complete coronavirus coverage On Tuesday, the ministry also directed the company to stop advertising the product till the claim was verified.The Ayush ministry is currently in the process of examining the documents.“It’s a good thing that Baba Ramdev has given a new medicine to the country, but as per rules, it has to come to the Ayush ministry first. They even said that they have sent a report; we will look into it and permission will be given after seeing the report,” Ayush minister Shripad Naik told news agency ANI on Wednesday.It wasn’t immediately clear how the company launched its product without a clearance from the ministry. A senior official in the ministry of Ayush added on condition of anonymity that the claims made by Patanjali were being verified by experts in the ministry.“We weren’t aware of it (the drug) until yesterday (Tuesday), and now that they have submitted the documents, our experts will be examining it before anything is said conclusively. There is a protocol for conducting clinical trials for any medicine under the Ayush system that we have notified, so we will examine what kind of approvals they have, and what type of trial was conducted with the primary and secondary objective. All technical parameters will be examined,” the official said.According to the trial data submitted by the company, in a double blind single centre randomised study at a hospital in Jaipur, the National Institute of Medical Sciences, the drug was tested on 120 patients. The primary outcome was the virological clearance in a RT-PCR test at “baseline”, after three days, and after seven days.The secondary outcome was reduction in Serum C reactive protein (CRP) and IL-6 levels. High CRP and IL-6 levels are an indicator of inflammation. According to the findings of the trail, there was a  69% recovery on Day 3 in the treatment group, and 100% recovery at Day 7, which was 35% better recovery than the placebo group. The documents said that “Serum CRP levels are lesser in treatment group” and that there was a “remarkable decrease in IL-6 levels”. According to Dr Ganpat Devpura, a professor of medicine at NIMS and the principal investigator of the trial, by design, excluded people with co-morbidities and the age of patients studied was 35-45 years . He also added that the patients were either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic because those were the kind of patients available for the trial at the hospital.Clinical trials usually have wider samples -- for instance, before being approved, allopathic medicines go through trials that sometimes involve tens of thousands of people. Several voices have raised concerns about the trial design since Tuesday when Patanjali made the results public. “The #PatanjaliAyurved trial enrolled 120 COVID+mildly ill patients & looked at viral clearance and decrease in IL-6 levels as endpoints. IL-6—the indicator of severe inflammation & cytokine storm—is unlikely to be elevated early in these patients. How would the drug impact it?” tweeted SP Kalantri, who identifies himself as a physician, teacher and researcher among other things.Indeed, some of the findings may not be a measure of the efficacy of the drugs being tested, another expert said: Explaining the implications, Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care, Medanta Hospital, said: “In early stages of the disease it’s highly unlikely that a patient will develop cytokine storm indicated by high levels of c-reactive protein and IL-6. Almost 80-90% cases are mild who would recover on their own anyway so if the resolution being talked about is reduction in IL-6 or CRP levels then for mild cases it doesn’t seem to be suitable.”“These are just initial findings and not yet peer reviewed. We will submit final results to Central Council for Research in Ayurvedic Sciences for review but it should take about a month or two. The trial is still on-going. As to why the company has already begun manufacturing the drug you must ask the manufacturer. I cannot comment on that,” said Dr Devpura.Pantanjali spokesperson Tijarawala reiterated that no rules were flouted. “Everything is in order; nothing has been violated. medicines have been in use for years, and we only lent scientific validity to its results.” While the drug trial is registered with the central trials registry of India (CTRI) , which is run by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the data has not been yet uploaded on the site. “The results will be uploaded on CTRI website soon,” said Patanjali in its documents submitted to the Ayush ministry.Dr Anurag Agarwal, director, CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, said everything depends on the data and the design: “Interim results can be useful in some cases, but it all depends on the study design. If the results aren’t out in public domain that it becomes difficult to say.”ICMR, however, said registering with CTRI is just a small part of the clinical trials process, and that the crucial part is declaring and getting the results vetted. The findings of the study are also yet to be peer-reviewed. “The data has to be made public and reviewed by experts, which in this case is the ministry of Ayush. There are several approvals such as institutional ethics committee’s approval, and factors such as number of trial participants and the quality of data generated and where it is published that are to be considered. CTRI can only enrol but efficacy and non-efficacy is different process altogether that we cannot comment on but is for the Ayush ministry to verify,” said Dr Rajnikant Srivastava, spokesperson ICMR. Meanwhile Uttarakhand’s licensing department for Ayurveda told news agency ANI, “As per Patanjali’s application, we issued them a license. They didn’t mention coronavirus, we only approved license for immunity booster, cough and fever. We will issue them notice asking how they got permission to make the kit.” Patanjali’s Tijarawala added that the “state Ayush department has been in the loop all throughout and adequate permissions were sought from it for the use of these medicines in combination”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/patanjali-s-breakthrough-needs-vetting-say-experts/story-6aCmCsigKnLhzPl6FeSzaK.html
25-06-2020||India||Ministries see rural sector driving economic recovery||In a silver lining, the country’s economic recovery is going to be rural sector-led, inputs for an interministerial draft review being prepared for the prime minister’s office states, with countryside demand for goods and services rallying ahead of that in cities and towns, according to officials aware of the matter. About Rs 73,500 crore in liquid cash, or money in hand, from prices the government has paid for crops to 4.2 million farmers till June 17, re-employment in rural sectors and a surplus monsoon so far are some of the indicators cited in the draft. Cement sales, an indicator of construction activity, the largest workforce employer after agriculture, is higher in rural areas, it says. The country’s planting of Kharif or summer crops is higher by nearly 20% than last year’s levels for this time of the year, the inputs say, adding this has helped raise sales of fertilizer, pesticides, seeds, fuel and hiring of labour. The government also plans to directly coordinate with local authorities in 116 districts estimated to have witnessed the largest reverse migration of workers from cities for job creation in rural industries, the draft says. “Demand from rural India will naturally feed into the manufacturing sector. This will help in meeting the challenges. The government will have to sustain rural momentum. This is the nature of feedback,” an official said, requesting anonymity.The finance ministry’s economic advisors are hopeful of a so-called “V-shaped” recovery by next fiscal, the official cited above said, adding that policies would be constantly “calibrated as warranted”. Economists commonly express economic downturns and recovery in charts that show shapes, such as U, V, and W. The shape V, which shows a fall followed by a sharp rise, represents a quicker recovery. To be sure, analysts continue to make grimmer projections of overall growth. Eight of the most industrialised states, accounting for half of the India’s gross domestic product (GDP), will see the largest declines in people’s incomes this fiscal, chief economic advisor of the State Bank of India Soumya Kanti Ghosh said in a note on Wednesday. Fitch Ratings forecasts growth in GDP, the widest measure of incomes, to shrink 5% in the current year through March 2021. The government is counting heavily on rural spending, including its own expenditure, the draft suggests. “The Food Corporation of India (FCI) has finished record procurement (government’s buying of farm produce) of wheat, rice and pulses. It was the highest ever,” a second official said. “The direct in-account payments of Rs 73,500 core completed by the FCI till June 17 is also highest ever and this money is available to spend.” The procurement operations were delayed due to the first phase of the Covid-19 lockdown and started a fortnight late on April 15. The government was able to buy wheat harvests of 38.2 million tonnes by June 16, a record, the review states. The draft cites data from the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, which showed the continuing fall in the rural unemployment rate to 7.26% in the week that ended on June 21. This job loss rate has now dropped to the lowest level in three months.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman in May announced Rs 40,000 crore for the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme. This took up the total allocation, along with Rs 61,000 crore announced in the Budget, to the scheme to Rs 1.01 lakh crore, the highest ever.The inputs, in the form of a presentation, are part of the government’s routine monitoring of economic activity, the official cited in the first instance said. K Mani, an economist with the Tamil Nadu Agriculture University, said the rural economy alone cannot do the “heavy lifting” of the economy. The GDP per worker in agriculture is just a third of the overall GDP per worker, which means expansion of higher productivity sectors such as manufacturing remains critical, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministries-see-rural-sector-driving-economic-recovery/story-Yv126Uv8IZHSbEUCp42I9N.html
25-06-2020||India||BJP’s JP Nadda, Congress spar over LAC standoff||Ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Jagat Prakash Nadda on Wednesday hit out at the Congress and the Gandhi family for questioning the government’s stand on June 15 face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh, saying “a rejected and ejected dynasty is not equal to the entire opposition”.Nadda called it the opposition’s right to ask questions and added healthy deliberations took place at the all-party meeting over the face-off in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. He added several opposition leaders gave their valuable inputs at the meeting. “They also fully supported the Centre in determining the way ahead. One family was an exception. Any guesses who?” Nadda said in another tweet.“One ‘royal’ dynasty and their ‘loyal’ courtiers have grand delusions of the opposition being about one dynasty. A dynast throws tantrums and his courtiers peddle that fake narrative. Latest one relates to the opposition asking questions to the government.”He added “a time rejected and ejected dynasty is NOT equal” to the entire opposition. “One dynasty’s interests are not India’s interests. Today, the nation is united and supportive of our armed forces. This is the time for unity and solidarity. Relaunch of ‘the scion’ for the nth time can wait,” added Nadda.The reference to relaunch came amid speculation over Rahul Gandhi’s return as the Congress chief a year after he stepped down following his party dismal performance in the 2019 national polls. “Due to the misadventures of one dynasty: We lost thousands of square kilometers of our land. The Siachen glacier was almost gone. And much more. No wonder India has rejected them,” Nadda tweeted.The Congress hit back and reminded Nadda of the BJP’s “conduct” as an opposition party until 2014. “BJP should not hide behind the army. The BJP should look back at its conduct when it attacked the government on delicate foreign policy issues during the [Congress-led ] UPA [United Progressive Alliance] rule,” Congress spokesman Manish Tewari said.He also referred to BJP member Tapir Gao in the Lok Sabha in November 2019 when he claimed that Chinese forces had intruded into Indian territory in his home state of Arunachal Pradesh, and said that the PM should clear up the remarks made by his party colleague. “But the government remained silent on the issue,” Tewari said.He asked whether Prime Minister Narendra Modi will offer an apology for the BJP’s conduct from 2004 to 2014 as the opposition party and for bringing a no-confidence motion over the India-US civil nuclear deal. Tewari said the BJP also sent a delegation to India-China border when it was in opposition in 2010 following Chinese incursions.The BJP is taking comfort from the outcome of the June 19 all-party meeting even as the Congress attacked the government over its handling of the border standoff with China.Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar spoke about the strategic importance of the Galwan Valley at the meeting. He underlined the need to evacuate the Chinese forces from there. Other leaders like Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee, and Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam president MK Stalin backed the government’s position on the issue.Mayawati continues to support the government, while other opposition leaders have not spoken about the standoff since the meeting.The Congress questioned Modi’s stand and sought to know if there was an intelligence failure over the Chinese build-up along the border. Sonia Gandhi, the Congress president, sought an assurance from the government that status quo ante would be restored and China will return to its original positions along the contested border.The party has rejected as “completely wrong” suggestion that the Congress was isolated at the all-party meeting.“All parties including the Congress expressed their solidarity with the government and armed forces and said we will stand by the armed forces, the government in the defence of India and the territorial integrity. So, there is no contradiction between Congress and other opposition parties,” Congress leader P Chidambaram said on Saturday. He said the Congress raised questions because its representative was the first speaker at the meeting. “We have raised a series of questions through the Congress president. Now, succeeding speakers did not raise the same questions... that does not mean that they disagree with those questions or distance themselves from those questions.” He added they also want answers to the same questions. “Do not try to create a division between Congress and other opposition parties.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nadda-cong-spar-over-lac-standoff/story-ojxJQz3ktLDuMOG6iQdt3J.html
25-06-2020||India||Monsoon reaches Delhi-NCR early||The south-west monsoon arrived in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) on Wednesday, marking only the sixth early onset of the season in 20 years, heralding an intense spell of rain in the next couple of days and, in the medium term, holding out the promise of a bountiful summer harvest. Weather scientists held off on a declaration of the monsoon in the capital until Thursday because there had been no rain until 8:30 am on Wednesday, the threshold time for measurement of the precipitation. It will be declared after the rainfall between 8.30 am Wednesday and 8:30 am Thursday is measured.On Wednesday, Delhi’s Safdarjung Observatory had received 14.6 mm of rain, which is in the moderate category.“Monsoon has reached Delhi-NCR. It has already covered several parts of western Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday night. We will officially declare monsoon over Delhi on Thursday based on rainfall data collected from 8.30 am on Wednesday to 8.30 am on Thursday,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head of the Regional Weather Forecasting Centre of the India Meteorological Department (IMD).A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of India’s annual rainfall, is critical to the fortunes of the agricultural sector on which at least 700 million people in India are dependent for a livelihood. The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people. In the past 20 years, the monsoon has arrived earlier in the capital than its expected date five times. In 2001, it arrived on June 24; in 2008 on June 15 ; in 2011 on June 26 ; in 2013 on June 16 and in 2015 on June 25 .The normal arrival date of the monsoon over Delhi is June 27. It was June 29 until last year but was revised by the IMD this year based on monsoon data from 1961 to 2019. Till last year, historical rainfall data from 1901-1940 from 149 weather stations was considered for calculating the monsoon arrival and withdrawal dates. New monsoon onset and withdrawal dates were announced by IMD in April as the old dates did not represent the actual monsoon trends.“We are expecting very good rains over north-west India this monsoon. Monsoon is setting in in Delhi, but it can be declared on Thursday after collating the 24-hour rainfall data,” said Mrutunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD.IMD, in its long-range monsoon forecast, has predicted good rains in north-west India this monsoon at 107% of the long-period average (LPA) of 61.5 cm.LPA is the average of rainfall received in the area over a 50-year period between 1961 and 2010.“In recent decades our data has shown that monsoon arrives earlier than normal in many parts of northwest India. Monsoon is also covering the entire country by July 8 compared to July 15 considered to be normal earlier. But monsoon arrival is slightly delayed in some parts of central India in recent years. Based on all these trends we have released new onset and withdrawal dates this year,” said D S Pai, senior scientist at IMD Pune. “This year, however, monsoon progression is near normal in almost all parts of the country,” he added.A trough of low pressure is running from northwest Rajasthan to south Bihar at lower tropospheric levels.

25-06-2020||India||India-China standoff: Vigil along LAC in Depsang crucial, say experts||As Indian and Chinese forces prepare to act on an understanding to disengage from all friction areas along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), it is crucial that the army keeps a strict vigil along the contested border with a special focus on eastern Ladakh’s Depsang plains, officials and China watchers tracking the dispute said on Wednesday.The heightened concerns about Depsang come from an earlier intrusion in this sector in 2013 when the PLA set up positions 19 km into the Indian side of the LAC and triggered a face-off that took three weeks to resolve.The Depsang plains lie south of Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) in a strategic area that the military calls Sub-Sector North (SSN). DBO is the country’s northernmost outpost where India operates an advanced landing ground to support forward military deployments.Keeping strict vigil along the disputed border, especially in sensitive areas in SSN, during the disengagement process is vital, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), who was the director general of military operations during the Depsang face-off.The 2013 Chinese intrusion into Indian territory blocked the access of Indian soldiers to several patrolling routes including the ones leading Patrol Points to 10, 10-A, 11, 12 and 13. Indian and Chinese military commanders reached a “mutual consensus to disengage” from all friction areas during a 11-hour meeting at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC on Monday. The talks were aimed at cooling tensions and thinning the military build-up on both sides of the border which has been tense since a brutal brawl on June 15 left 20 Indian army personnel and an unconfirmed number of Chinese troops dead in Galwan Valley.“The SSN, including Depsang area, is of huge strategic significance and there’s no question of the army lowering its guard there. The Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldi (DS-DBO) runs through this area that is near the Karakoram pass,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).India is building a second road from Sasoma to Saser La in eastern Ladakh and it could eventually provide an alternative route to DBO, as reported by Hindustan Times on June 9. The Sasoma-Saser La road axis is south-west of DBO.“India will have to progress cautiously during the disengagement process as the possibility of the PLA opening a new front cannot be ruled out,” said a senior officer on condition of anonymity. The disengagement process, to be carried out in different sectors, in phases is yet to kick off, he said. It is expected to gather momentum after commanders on the ground hold more meetings in the coming days.China has deployed up to 10,000 troops in its “depth areas” across the LAC in eastern Ladakh and the military buildup includes including fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence radars. India has matched China’s military moves.Neither India nor China is likely to immediately thin its deployment in the rear areas, given how volatile the disputed border has been, especially after the brutal clash at Galwan Valley, as reported by Hindustan Times on Wednesday. The clash derailed a previous disengagement plan worked out by senior Indian and Chinese commanders after their first meeting on June 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vigil-along-lac-in-depsang-crucial-experts/story-7pqA5ZnpTpkVoIpT6dwPRK.html
25-06-2020||India||Made-in-China labels soon on products sold by e-tailers?||The government is considering making it mandatory for all retailers and e-commerce platforms to display the country of origin on every product they sell so that consumers have a choice between local and imported goods, people aware of the development said.This would also help consumers avoid the purchase of products originating from countries such as China if they wish to boycott them, the people said, requesting anonymity. After the recent violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh, which left 20 Indians dead, there have been calls for a boycott of Chinese goods.Bloomberg reported that Amazon.com Inc. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart agreed to compel merchants to start prominently displaying “country of origin“ for all goods sold online in India, bowing to regulatory demands as tensions with China escalate. The report said that the internet giants joined about a dozen other online retailers including Facebook Inc.-backed Jio Platforms in agreeing to the move.The ministry of commerce and industry on Wednesday held a stakeholders’ meeting on ways to enforce explicit labelling of goods with their respective countries of origin after it was made mandatory for products sold on the state-run trading platform Government e-Marketplace (GeM) from Tuesday, the people cited above said. Government representatives told online retailers to work out a system that would provide “visibility” to customers about the place whee products sold on their platforms are manufactured, said two people present in the meeting through video conference.No final decision could be taken on Wednesday;another meeting will be held in a week or two after wider consultations with stakeholders because of complexities in supply chains and globalisation of manufacturing activities, they said.The meeting was attended by representatives of the retail industry, including Amazon, Flipkart, Reliance Retail, Reliance Jio and GeM. The companies and the ministry of commerce and industry declined to comment.A government official said, “It was an official-level meeting and it was part of the consultation process. A final decision would be taken by the competent authority after reflecting on all issues raised by the stakeholders.”Another official said there were demands from both retailers and consumers to make the country of origin explicit on products so that consumers who would like to boycott Chinese products could do so.The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT), a body of about 70 million traders, is spearheading a nationwide movement for boycott of Chinese products. Its secretary general Praveen Khandelwal said traders have asked commerce minister Piyush Goyal to make it mandatory for all e-commerce platforms to mention country of origin as mandated for GeM.“In the current manufacturing scenario, when supply chain or various components for one product is spread across several countries, it is not always easy to identify the place of manufacturing. For example, many mobiles, assembled in India, have close to 90% components coming from places like China, Korea or Taiwan. How to identify its country of origin?,” one person who attended the meeting asked.Manasvi Srivastava, partner-trade & customs at consulting firm KPMG India, said: “From the point of view of providing a customer informed choice, prescribing country of origin labelling on products sold in India would be a good move. Similar requirements exist in other countries like US and South Korea. There would be need for regulatory and administrative clarity on the matter before implementing such a change.” According to Srivastava, the move will also help in framing trade policies. “There would be a shift in the pattern of trade flows between India and countries exporting to India, as customers begin to exercise informed preferences. This would make it possible for the government of India to exercise and enforce policy options on external and internal trade better,” he said.“However, if new requirements are implemented without creating definition clarity and harmonizing different regulations, there could be avoidable disruption of trade and supply chains.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/naming-country-of-origin-for-retail-products-being-considered-by-govt/story-U3MNLt3vDejYcUvblVRQHN.html
25-06-2020||India||Government’s position must be status quo ante, says Cong leader AK Antony||Congress leader AK Antony, who served as India’s defence ministry from 2006 to 2014, when India was governed by a United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government, spoke to Hindustan Times in the backdrop of the latest conflict with China. Edited excerpts:They are referring to 1962, which was a betrayal by China. The whole country never expected that China will betray us. India was arguing for China’s inclusion at the UN Security Council at that time. The euphoria at the time was China saying “Hindi Chini, Bhai Bhai”. After that, the country was more careful, and successive governments started strengthening our borders, building more infrastructure, getting more equipment, weapons for the army, airforce and navy -- more aircraft, more tanks. All governments were doing that, but during the UPA time, we spent the maximum. It was an economic boom time, and we spent to strengthen the armed forces. I can tell you that after 2006, we spent more than double the amount for the defence budget. They are now well-equipped and their morale is high. In mountain warfare, the Indian Army is one of the best in the world. In a war-like situation, however, they will have to be supported more.It is totally wrong, totally false. What is wrong with the agreement between the Congress party and the Chinese Communist Party? The BJP is also sending delegations to Chinese Communist Party meetings, at the invitation of the Chinese. It is party to party, and not only the Congress. Narendra Modi is the only chief minister who visited China, I think, four times or more. He was invited so many times. At embassy-level meetings, so many people go; many MPs go. Those are different things, but when the question of national interest comes, then it is a different matter. The Congress party always stands for national unity. Also Read: How India can keep China in check | OpinionI can tell you my experience during Manmohan Singh’s time. I attended the all-party meeting, I was defence minister for more than seven years. All parties used to raise many doubts and queries. It is the job of the opposition parties. Sonia Gandhi categorically said we are with the government, we are with the armed forces. She raised some doubts, which is natural. She had some doubts -- why did this happen? In Ladakh, both armies identified over the years more than a dozen disputed sites — Galwan was not a disputed point; it was always Indian territory. So why have the Chinese suddenly attacked Indian territory when the whole country was still under the euphoria of the Mahalbalipuram meeting? And the Galwan Valley aggression was not an accident; it was premeditated and pre-planned, even though the incursion came to light in April, it was prepared for much before that. That is why they were able to mobilise tanks, equipment, tents. When I was defence minister, in 2010 we started the construction of the road to the Galwan Valley. Also Read: China finally admits casualties in Galwan clash, claims ‘numbers not very high’At that time, there was no objection from the Chinese army. Why suddenly this dispute; why suddenly has China decided to cheat India? Just like in 1962, when the whole country was under the euphoria of Bandung conference, we have now seen similar cheating — a betrayal. So, naturally, you have to ask the questions. The Chinese army is now up to the Finger 4 area; they are still there, they are still fortifying their positions, so it is natural as an opposition party to ask questions about that. During our time, we took the major decision of raising a strike corps, so she asked what happened, what is the status of these. But she also said that we are with the government, we are with the armed forces.Depsang, 2013, and Chumar, 2014 -- the Chinese came, but not like this. In Galwan Valley, they came with thousands of forces. In 2013, after 21 days of standoff, through army and diplomatic talks, the Chinese army withdrew to the original position. There was some scuffle face-to-face at that time too, but no injuries. This time, still they are there since mid- April. Every day, they seem to be fortifying. Our army is well trained, well-equipped; in mountain warfare they are the best. To resolve the issue, we need army-level talks, diplomatic-level talks, and if needed, political-level talks. At the same time, the government’s position should be status quo ante, which means Chinese army must go back to the position before this process started.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-government-s-position-must-be-status-quo-ante-ak-antony/story-Pb81SClJhmO79SzQcy1I6L.html
25-06-2020||India||Army chief awards commendations to troops who fought in Galwan Valley||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, who is in Ladakh for a security review, on Wednesday awarded commendation cards to three soldiers who were part of the outnumbered Indian squad that bravely fought off Chinese troops during a brutal brawl in Galwan Valley on June 15, an official said on Wednesday.The clash left 20 Indian soldiers and an unconfirmed number of Chinese troops dead.Among the other troops who were awarded commendation cards by Naravane were two soldiers who displayed courage and resolve during a violent face-off with Chinese troops near Pangong Tso on May 5-6, the official said.Both face-offs saw Chinese soldiers gather in large numbers and attack Indian troops with stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs.The army chief was briefed on the latest developments along the disputed border and the progress of military talks with China after a meeting between senior commanders on Monday at Moldo on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control, the official said.The army chief is in Ladakh at a time when both armies are working out the modalities of a disengagement plan even as the Chinese army has not stopped its buildup in key strategic areas. Naravane visited Durbuk and Chushul in eastern Ladakh and also undertook an aerial survey of areas where the army is deployed, he added. The army chief is expected to interact with more soldiers on the ground on Thursday before flying back to Delhi. On reaching Leh on Tuesday, he was driven straight to the military hospital where soldiers injured in the June 15 skirmish are undergoing medical treatment.This is the army chief’s second visit to Ladakh after border tensions erupted in early May. He had earlier visited Leh on May 22.The current situation along LAC marks the first major flare-up since the 73-day standoff between India and China at Doklam near the Sikkim border in 2017.Last week, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria made a low-key visit to Ladakh to review the Indian Air Force’s preparedness in the sector, where the IAF is operating its fighter jets and new attack and heavy-lift helicopters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-awards-commendations-to-troops-who-fought-in-galwan-valley/story-XRjy5AdhrEGTnsrYBQmcnK.html
25-06-2020||India||Satellite images capture China’s PLA build-up in Ladakh||China has not halted — and instead has ramped up — its military activity along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, with a concentration of soldiers, military vehicles, earth-moving machinery, and erection of structures, including near the same point where Indian and Chinese troops clashed on the night of June 15, according to two senior officials and satellite imagery of the area on June 22. The Indian army has observed a new structure, suspected to be an observation post, come up near Patrol Point (PP) 14, the site of the clash which left 20 personnel of the Indian army and an unconfirmed number of Chinese troops dead, said one of the officials cited above.There was no official word from the army on either of the developments. India and China agreed to pull back from friction areas on Monday.New satellite imagery, released by US firm Maxar Technologies, supports the claim that not only is the PLA holding ground in Galwan Valley but has also shored up its military positions in the area. One of the Maxar images too possibly points out a new and bigger observation post near PP-14. An Indian squad, led by the slain Colonel Santosh Babu of the 16 Bihar Regiment, had flattened some structures in this area including an observation post, on June 15. The satellite images are from June 22 — the day senior Indian and Chinese military commanders reached a “mutual consensus to disengage” from all friction areas during an 11-hour meeting at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC.Officials and China watchers, who reviewed the images for Hindustan Times, said the visuals clearly indicated a Chinese buildup and also a new outpost for carrying out surveillance on Indian areas. But they also added that it was important to give the armies time to disengage and pointed to the complexities of satellite imagery. “A large number of tented camps, military vehicles, heavy trucks and bulldozers are clearly visible on the riverbed. Road construction is also taking place. The Chinese positions are bang on the LAC,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd), one of the experts who reviewed the satellite imagery for HT. Hooda said the observation post appeared to have come up again near PP-14.The Chinese buildup in other areas along the LAC including Depsang, Gogra Post-Hot Springs and Pangong Tso, hasn’t thinned either. The PLA’s armoured vehicles and artillery units remain deployed in Chinese areas facing Depsang and Gogra Post-Hot Springs sectors.The army is keeping a strict vigil along the LAC and is fully prepared to respond to any provocation or adventurism by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA), said the second officer cited above. Given the observed build-up, the army is also prepared to keep its guards up till disengagement takes place on the ground on a verifiable basis. But experts also said that it was important to be cautious. The process of disengagement is likely to be arduous and challenging, and will require moving ahead cautiously in phases, as reported by HT on Wednesday.“Disengagement can’t happen overnight. While the images are a cause for concern and somewhat reveal China’s intentions to hold ground near LAC in Galwan Valley, the result of the talks between senior commanders will not reflect on the ground in just two days,” Hooda said. The interpretation of satellite imagery is also tricky and can result in reaching incorrect conclusions, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations. “It’s about how you superimpose the LAC on satellite images. It allows you to reach your conclusions. However, some of the interpretation may be correct,” said Bhatia who heads the Centre for Joint Warfare Studies, a defence ministry think tank.China has deployed more than 10,000 troops in its ‘depth areas’ across the LAC in eastern Ladakh and the military buildup consists of fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence radars. India has matched the neighbour’s military moves.While disengagement in some friction areas is believed to be a “low-hanging fruit” and can be achieved in a reasonable time-frame, the “real test” would lie in the restoration of status quo ante in the Finger Area in Pangong-Tso, where the PLA has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes and observation posts, officials said. China watchers believe that the disengagement process is likely to be less complicated in the Gogra Post-Hot Springs and the Galwan Valley sectors, where there are no real issues about the alignment of the LAC, if Beijing abides by the understanding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/satellite-images-capture-pla-build-up-in-ladakh/story-bLvwm1lvP4OKRgKudm3eyH.html
25-06-2020||India||Cabinet nod for private sector in space||The Union cabinet, at a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, on Wednesday approved the formation of a new organization, the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), seeking to open up space infrastructure to the private sector.At a press briefing held shortly after the cabinet meeting, Union minister of state Jitendra Singh termed the decision “historic.”IN-SPACe will provide a level playing field for private sector companies to use Indian space infrastructure, he said. “It will also hand-hold, promote and guide the private industries in space activities,” he said.The far-reaching reforms in the space sector are aimed at boosting the private sector’s participation in the entire range of space activities. “This will unlock India’s potential in the space sector”, Singh said.He said the new organisation will play a supplementary role to the Indian Space Research Organisation, formed in 1969, to “harness space technology for national development while pursuing space science research and planetary exploration”. The public sector New Space India Limited (NSIL) will endeavour to reorient space activities from a supply-driven to a demand-driven model, thereby ensuring optimum use of space assets.“The proposed reforms will enhance the socio-economic use of space assets and activities, including through improved access to space assets, data and facilities,” an official statement said.These reforms will allow ISRO to focus more on research and development activities, new technologies, exploration missions and human spaceflight programme. Some of the planetary exploration missions will also be opened up to the private sector through an “announcement of opportunity” mechanism, the statement said.“IN-SPACe will ensure a level playing field for private companies, and a friendly, fair, rigorous, and speedy regulatory environment, spur investment, and innovation. NSIL, will drive demand for space products and services, to ensure optimum utilization of space assets,” said K VijayRaghavan, principal scientific advisor to the government of India, in a series of tweets.“These reforms are in line with global best practices, and designed to ensure India sees new companies making new investments and providing new services in this sector very soon,” he tweeted.Several other important decisions were taken in the meeting on Wednesday including bringing hundreds of banks (what banks are these. commercial banks are already under RBI) under the supervision of the Reserve Bank of India.The cabinet approved the establishment of an Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund and additional investment by ONGC Videsh, the overseas arm of Oil and Natural Gas Corporation, in Myanmar.It also approved the declaration of Kushinagar Airport in Uttar Pradesh as an international airport and extended the term of the commission constituted to examine the issue of sub-categorisation of Other Backward Classes (OBCs) by six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cabinet-nod-for-private-sector-in-space/story-YDddWo9FZuoXFDmPOMqw8I.html

On Wednesday, when asked about the trove released by hackers, the person said the company did not have anything more to add for now.“Their statement is inaccurate as the breach occurred several weeks ago, not on Monday. As you would imagine, it takes time from the initial breach to data exfiltration and extortion. It appears that the management underestimated, or was misguided about the impact and responded inaccurately,” the Cyble spokesperson said.A ransomware attack – which involves making a target’s files inaccessible by encrypting them -- is carried out almost always by cyber criminals with a money motive as compared to nation-state hackers who often target privileged access or disruption of an adversary’s systems.In this instance, the hackers encrypted the files using the CL0P ransomware.“CL0P ransomware demands generally range from $50,000 to over $1 million – it depends on the target and negotiations,” said the Cyble spokesperson, adding that the agency was not aware of the exact ransom amount in this case.Gurugram-headquartered IndiaBulls Group has several subsidiaries that offer financial services, including housing finance and consumer loans. On its website, the group says it “has a net worth of more than ₹ 28,580 Cr. (as on 31st March, 2019)”.It was not immediately clear how the company’s systems were breached, but Cyble, in its initial report on Tuesday, noted that the company was found to have vulnerabilities in its virtual private network (VPN) system. The exact method of the hack which would have allowed the ransomware to be installed was yet to be determined.(With inputs from Rajeev Jayaswal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiabulls-hit-with-ransomware-attack/story-m2nJBlQTtkeFPbStz8QkKO.html
25-06-2020||India||Traces of coronavirus found in sewage in Gujarat||Traces of Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), have been found in sewage samples in Gujarat, prompting a central agency to consider strengthening surveillance and study whether contaminated sewage can cause infection.“The next step obviously is to determine whether there is risk of infection through this channel or not. However it will still take some time before we start on that as currently there are several surveillance initiatives that need immediate attention,” said an official in the Union ministry of health, requesting not to be identified. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Only Gujarat has so far reported the presence of the virus in sewage, “and we need to see if other states also report it,” the official added. “We will continue sewage sample testing for some time.”Taking the help of its robust polio surveillance system that regularly tests sewage samples for presence of polio viruses, India’s National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) started sewage sample testing to detect the presence of the Sars-Cov-2 virus in an attempt to strengthen Covid-19 surveillance.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todaySuch surveillance has been a key component of India’s successful fight against he poliomyelitis virus that enters through the mouth and multiplies in the intestine. Although India has been polio-free since 2011, surveillance is still underway because the disease is still endemic in three countries--Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria. “We have World Health Organisation (WHO) reference lab for polio surveillance which conducts tests on regular basis on sewage samples to check for the presence of polio viruses. The same lab and its surveillance system, including manpower, is being used to monitor the presence of Sars-Cov-2 in sewage samples,” said the official quoted above. NCDC, which spearheads all disease surveillance projects in the country, along with its partners, began sewage sample testing around April. The focus states were Gujarat, Maharashtra and Delhi that had a high Covid-19 disease burden.“Though there is enough evidence to prove that the disease does not follow the faecal–oral route of transmission, there is no harm in expanding the scope of disease surveillance to be able to know the spread of the disease better, especially since we have a monitoring system and an advanced lab already in place for the purpose,” said an official in NCDC, who did not wish to be identified. Faecal shedding is a common phenomenon in any viral diseases, and there is enough evidence to show that those individuals who are Covid-positive shed the virus through stool.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “Studies show that the virus does travel to the gut in a Covid person with a high viral load. It is not unexpected to find the presence of this virus in sewage. What the surveillance system will be monitoring, however, is that if the contamination in the sewage system is happening to the extent that it will lead to transmission of the disease,” said the official.At the local level, scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology in Gandhinagar, who collaborated with the Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre and the Gujarat Pollution Control Board to study samples of wastewater collected on May 8 and May 27 from one of waste water treatment plants in Ahmedabad, also found traces of Sars-CoV-2.Also read: Herd immunity can be achieved at 43%, new study on Covid-19 findsIn an early release study published online in Emerging Infectious Disease Journal, researchers had isolated Sars-CoV-2 from faeces of a patient in China with Covid-19 who died. “Confirmation of infectious virus in faeces affirms the potential for faecal–oral or faecal–respiratory transmission and warrants further study,” the paper said.“The virus is believed to be spread by direct contact, fomites (particles deposited on surfaces), respiratory droplets, and possibly aerosols. Viral RNA has been detected in faeces and urine of some patients. Infectious virus was also isolated from urine of a patient with severe COVID-19. However, it is unclear whether the virus in faeces is infectious and might be an additional source for transmission,” the paper added. Sewage sample testing can be a good surveillance tool along with sero (blood) surveys, say experts.“SARS may have spread through sewage in Hong Kong and now new data on infectious SARS CoV-2 in stool. Was this an unusual patient or will this route of transmission be a major player? At the very least, we should think about more sewage sampling,” tweeted Gagandeep Kang, physician-scientist and faculty, Translational Health Science and Technology Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/traces-of-virus-found-in-sewage-in-gujarat/story-dK4peiboaaYzGT7bt6EmTK.html
25-06-2020||India||Covid-19: Herd immunity can be achieved at 43%, new study finds||A region can achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 with fewer people than previously estimated, a new study said on Wednesday, but experts cautioned that the humanitarian and medical costs of taking the route continue to remain high, especially in India. The study, published in the journal Science and conducted by mathematicians from the University of Nottingham and University of Stockholm, categorized people into separate groups reflecting their age and social activity levels. Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Their model found that the threshold percentage of population who need to be infected for the chain of transmission to be broken – known as herd immunity – was 43% and not 60%, as thought earlier. “It is a positive result that herd immunity appears earlier, but also that immunity prior to herd immunity has a bigger effect on reducing disease spread,” said Tom Britton of Stockholm University and the lead author of the paper.But the scientists warned that the 43% figure should not be interpreted literally as an exact value and instead should be seen as a study of how population differences affect herd immunity. Also read: Oxford vaccine against Covid-19 in final stage of clinical trials“Our findings have potential consequences for the current Covid-19 pandemic and the release of lockdown and suggests that individual variation (for example in activity level) is an important feature to include in models that guide policy,” said Professor Frank Ball from the University of Nottingham, one of the authors of the paper. The study devised six age categories and three activity categories: high, medium and low; and assumed that within each age bracket, 50% have normal activity, and 25% each have low and high activity level. The basic reproduction number, or the number of people infected by one patient, was assumed at 2.5The scientists flagged two important things. One, that activity level mattered more than age differences and that more socially active individuals were found more likely to get infected and spread the virus. Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe second was that herd immunity can be achieved in two ways: by vaccinating enough number of people or if enough people are infected and develop immunity against the disease. “The herd immunity level is lower when immunity is caused by disease spreading than when immunity comes from vaccination,” Bell said. The study also said the previous figure of 60% assumed that each individual in the population was equally likely to be vaccinated, and hence immune. However, that was not the case if immunity arises as a result of disease spreading in a population consisting of people with many different behaviours. This is why the herd immunity threshold was lower in a heterogeneous model. The debate around herd immunity, which happens when so many people in a community become immune to an infectious disease that it stops the disease from spreading, is at least six months old. Countries such as the United Kingdom backed off from the herd immunity strategy after studies predicted millions of deaths.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage While publishing the study, Science editor-in-chief Holden Thorp noted that even if the model’s prediction was correct, none of the seroprevalence studies suggested that any country was close to achieving herd immunity. “Continuing non-pharmaceutical interventions around the world is still of great importance,” he said. Other experts pointed to a recent study that showed levels of an antibody found in recovered Covid-19 patients fell sharply in 2-3 months after infection for both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients – which means immunity to the virus may not last. “So, even if herd immunity was achieved, there is no guarantee that antibody levels will stay the same,” said V Ramana Dhara, professor at the Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad. “The immunity depends on whether protective antibodies are produced. Both the CDC and WHO are stating there is yet no evidence of this so it should not be assumed that Covid antibodies are protective. The authors’ model has assumed immunity for an extended period but if that’s not the case, other models are needed. If the herd immunity does turn out to be protective, then the 43% makes it more feasible, but that’s a big if right now,” he added.Snehal Shekatkar, a professor at the Centre for Modelling and Simulation, Savitribai Phule Pune University, said the study’s prediction should be taken with a large pinch of salt since the study uses compartmental models of epidemiology instead of more accurate contact-network based models. “Adding heterogeneity in the population in the form of age-structure based contact rates certainly improves compartmental models but they nevertheless lack many important structural features present in the real-world contact networks. Also it is important to note that a particular value for R0 has been used in the study (R0=2.5), and for different R0 values, the threshold would be different,” he added.Shekatkar said achieving herd immunity was not feasible unless a region was very sparsely populated. “Even .1% of the population is a very high number of people to get infected or die,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/herd-immunity-can-be-achieved-at-43-new-study-finds/story-1khQxEgczeOARsoIGVD6LP.html

The vaccine is also being trialled in South Africa and Brazil, with Serum Institute of India (SII) investing $100 million to mass-produce one billion doses for India and other low-and-middle-income countries.The vaccine is made from the ChAdOx1 virus, which is a weakened version of a common cold virus (adenovirus) that causes infections in chimpanzees; it has been genetically changed so it can’t cause infection in humans.Watch | Oxford vaccine in final stage of clinical trials, academic calendar set to be reworkedAlso Read: In 100 days of Covid, many lessons for Lok Nayak hospital“The clinical studies are progressing very well and we are now initiating studies to evaluate how well the vaccine induces immune responses in older adults, and to test whether it can provide protection in the wider population,” said Professor Andrew Pollard, head of the Oxford Vaccine Group, in a statement on Wednesday.If the trial is successful, the Oxford Vaccine Group expects to launch the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of this year, which will make it the fastest vaccine to progress from lab to getting regulatory approval for use.The Oxford Vaccine Group is not the only group to move to a vaccine at warp speed. The pace of vaccine development is accelerating with each passing week with companies from around the word racing to be the first to develop an effective vaccine to stop or at least slow the spread of Covid-19.There were 13 experimental vaccines in clinical trials and another 129 in the preclinical evaluation stage on June 22, according to the World Health Organisation’s draft landscape of Covid-19 vaccines. On June 12, there were 10 in advanced clinical trials and 115 in preclinical evaluation stages.Vaccine development, on average, takes 10.71 years from the preclinical phase, and has a success rate of 6%, according to a study in the science journal, PLOS One. Some remain elusive for decades despite massive investments, like for vaccines against HIV, the virus that causes AIDS.Also Read: Covid-19: What you need to know todayVaccines from US-based Moderna Inc. and China’s Sinovac Biotech a will enter the final stage of trials next month, and Beijing-based China National Biotec Group Co. is the latest to receive regulatory approval to conduct phase 3 trials of its Covid-19 vaccines in the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday.Four vaccine candidates Indian companies are partnering to develop are in the preclinical trial stages to test their pharmacological effect and toxicity, with five companies in the fray. Delhi-based Panacea Biotec is partnering with Refana Inc. in the US to develop an inactivated whole virus vaccine, Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech is working on three vaccine candidates using two different platforms in the works, including one that uses an existing nasal flu vaccine, and SII has three partnerships with Oxford-AstraZeneca, US-biotech firm Codagenix, and Austria’s Themis Bioscience. Zydus Cadila in Ahmedabad and India Immunologicals in Hyderabad have also formed partnerships to develop Covid-19 vaccines.While a fast-tracked vaccine development process could have a vaccine for emergency use ready by early 2021, safety must not be compromised in the rush to reach the finish line, experts cautioned.“The dengue vaccine (Dengvaxia) controversy in the Philippines should be a grim reminder of the dangers of rushing ahead without safety checks in place. Philippines suspended its school-based dengue vaccination programme using Sanofi Pasteur’s Dengvaxia vaccine following reports of vaccination-related deaths. The company then cautioned that the vaccine carried higher risk for people without prior dengue infection,” said Dr N K Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research.Vaccination of healthy people carries a risk of subsequent Sars-CoV2 infection becoming more severe, as has happened before with vaccines including a coronavirus-unrelated respiratory virus in children, according to a paper published in Science on May 29.Vaccine development includes at least three human trials to test their safety, dosage and the strength and duration of the protection they offer, followed by production, licensing, deployment and plans for post-marketing surveillance. Many of these trials have been collapsed and merged in the case of Covid-19 to have a vaccine ready for use by early 2021.“With promising preliminary preclinical and phase 1 data available, meticulously planned trials are needed to separate the contenders from pretenders. Post-marketing data on adverse reactions is vital to measure the benefits in a large population, 60% of whom may develop some amount of herd or community immunity over the next two years that would help reduce transmission,” said Dr Ganguly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxford-vaccine-in-final-stage-of-clinical-trials/story-sVJz9DRIR4Lm9DRA7261pM.html
25-06-2020||India||‘Engaging diplomatically, but aggressive on ground’: Ram Madhav on China||India’s priority is to actively and proactively engage with China, diplomatically and militarily, and assert its right to the last inch of its territory, said Bharatiya Janata Party’s general secretary, Ram Madhav on Wednesday in reference to the current stand-off with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The BJP functionary said perceptions that the 1962 war was fought by China to teach USSR, of which India was an ally, a lesson and that in 2020 Beijing is trying to send a message to the US are valid but New Delhi’s priority will remain defending its territory.After 2014, Madhav said, the government is insisting on ownership of the LAC as India perceives it.“There will be no defeatist explanation of the past that there is an overlap (of the LAC),” he said, hitting out at the previous governments, whom he blamed for allowing China to grab Indian territory.The BJP leader said India will engage and push back.India and China have been locked in a stand-off along the LAC since early May and on June 15 a violent face-off between the two armies led to 20 India soldiers being killed in the line of duty.While the Congress has blamed the union government for the current strain in ties with Beijing, Madhav said, the Narendra Modi government has changed India’s China policy and unlike in the past when the neighbour was allowed to “nibble away” Indian territory, the county is now “fighting and pushing them back”.Speaking at an interactive session on the India-China Border Issue, organised by RSS publications Organiser and Panchajanya, Madhav said even as governments under Rajiv Gandhi, Narasimha Rao and HD Deve Gowda signed agreements with China, Beijing refused to acknowledge the LAC and was continually violating border.“What China has continued to do is gradually nibble away our territory like Aksai Chin, post 1980s the tactic has been to encroach little by little. What have we been doing in response? We are experts in bilateral agreements, we enter into a new agreement every five years,” he said, lashing out at the previous governments.“The Chinese side has always exploited this notional weakness of ours that the LAC is not a demarcated boundary so there is possibility of confusion. In 2013, Dr Manmohan Singh told Parliament, the LAC is a disputed imaginary line. There is an overlap of claims and confusion. The assertion that we will push them back, our benefit of doubt allowed them to nibble away our territory,” Madhav said.Pointing out that India is not a warmonger, the BJP leader said, the country will not settle for the peace of the graveyard.“We engage diplomatically, but on the ground we will be aggressive. We are asserting our right and not letting them get away with their semi constructions. PM Modi took up the issue of Chushul with Xi Jinping, we are not hiding, but confronting,” he said.The Congress accused the government of giving China a clean chit, rather than pushing them back.“Confusion rather than clarity dominates BJP foreign policy, where the PM, EAM, DM & BJP Gen Secy speak in different tones. Rather than giving theoretical explanations on the China stand-off, Mr Madhav should explain when will the status quo ante be restored? Have the Chinese made new structures in the Galwan Valley? Why are Chinese asserting again & again that Galwan is their territory and India has not given a firm reply?” said Jaiveer Shergill.Madhav said despite the Chinese aggression, India is determined to improve its border infrastructure. “We have close to 60 roads and bridges under construction. India’s claim line is not just the LAC, we have categorically stated that PoK and Aksai Chin, Gilgit-Baltistan are part of India too,” he said.Taking a swipe at the Congress, Madhav said, the party allowed “reverse Bhoodan (land donation)” by letting territory incursions happen on the Pakistan and China side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/engaging-diplomatically-but-aggressive-on-ground-ram-madhav-on-china/story-BcsbwXfOreVMy6B6BkyIyL.html
25-06-2020||India||China finally admits casualties in Galwan clash, claims ‘numbers not very high’||China did not suffer heavy casualties in the deadly brawl with Indian troops in eastern Ladakh on June 15 and has not revealed the number because a comparison could stir up hostility, a top Chinese official told foreign diplomats on Wednesday.Speaking to a select group of diplomats at the Chinese foreign ministry on Wednesday afternoon, He Xiangqi, deputy director general of boundary and ocean affairs, said the “…casualties on the Chinese side were not very heavy”.She added the reason for not revealing the casualty numbers is because Beijing does not want to stir up sentiments. Also Watch | Army chief meets soldiers at Ladakh hospital amid China tension“Exact casualties were not publicised as China did not want the media to play it up. Now was the time for both sides to find ways to de-escalate the situation and restore stability. Comparisons may trigger antagonism on both sides, which is not helpful,” He said at the briefing, diplomatic sources told Hindustan Times.This is the first time that a Chinese government official has acknowledged that the PLA suffered casualties and explained the reasons for not revealing the number of the injured or dead.While the Indian army lost 20 soldiers during the June 15 violent clash, Beijing has not revealed the casualty figures, though its state-controlled media has acknowledged that both sides sustained losses.The PLA’s casualty figures have been a focus of speculation.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said Tuesday that reports claiming more than 40 PLA troops died was “fake news”.Among the countries called for Wednesday’s briefing at the ministry included most south Asian countries, excluding Pakistan, The Association of Southeast Asian (ASEAN) countries, Japan and South Korea.The US, European countries and Australia were among the countries not invited to the briefing, which lasted for about 20 minutes.Within that brief span of time, He repeatedly blamed New Delhi for the clash.He told the foreign diplomats that India had violated bilateral agreements reached on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), including Article 1 of the 1993 agreement and Article 2 of the 1996 agreement.The 1993 agreement, the Chinese official referred to is the “Agreement on the Maintenance of Peace and Tranquility along the Line of Actual Control in the India-China Border Areas”The crux of Article 1 in that agreement, the official said, is this: “The two sides are of the view that the India-China boundary question shall be resolved through peaceful and friendly consultations. Neither side shall use or threaten to use force against the other by any means.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-official-admits-for-1st-time-ladakh-casualties-not-very-heavy/story-VmEzyJTihiOyqtLCBVXSXL.html
25-06-2020||India||Flights to begin in limited capacity at airports post-lockdown: AAI||Once restrictions on passenger flights are lifted airports will facilitate limited domestic and international scheduled flights in phases and may be at 30% capacity to facilitate social distancing, the Airport Authority of India has stated in a set of guidelines for resumption of service post-lockdown. Flight operations to its original level are likely to be scaled up in a gradual manner, according to the government’s plan. Airline operations are likely to begin in tier-I cities first, it added. “Initially it is presumed that airline operations will be limited to Tier-I cities i.e. Metros and some of the state capitals and major Tier-II cities. The flights schedule may be cleared on City Pair basis, so the origin and Destination Airports are open fully from lockdown situation,” according to the standard operating procedure for recommencement of operations at AAI Airports post lockdown.Also Watch: NRIs gather at Amritsar airport to board flight to UK At airports with more than one terminal, initially only one terminal shall be used and the larger terminal can be scaled down to reduce cleaning area considering limited availability of material resources, the SOP stated. “Immediately after the lockdown is lifted, or as per government directives in this direction, the scheduled flight operations will commence. Hence, all airports are required to be in preparedness to handle flight operations,” it added. Strict social distancing norms will be introduced inside the planes to ensure space between two passengers, Hindustan Times had reported on April 9. According to the SOP, passenger seating arrangement shall be done in such a manner so as to maintain social distancing (1- 1.5 m) among passengers using the chairs. “Sufficient staff shall be deployed near washrooms, X-Ray machines, conveyor belts etc. to guide passengers to maintain sufficient distance,” it said. Alternate check-in counters may also be introduced to avoid congestion. “Queue at counters shall be managed by airlines staff to manage sufficient distance among passengers. Also, Check-In counters may be opened well in advance to stagger the crowd,” it said. Social distancing (1-1.5 meter) markings and stickers will be provided at airports. Based on social distancing norms, airports will work out terminal building capacity and forward it to AAI so that the slot allocation for the planned scheduled flights post Covid- 19 lockdown by airline operators can be done accordingly. Food and Beverage Services and retail outlets will be limited to passengers till operations of airlines gradually increase. “Initially, they should serve tea/coffee etc. with take away snacks in boxes. As part of this limited restaurant facilities to be permitted inside security hold area,” it said. India has suspended international flights since March 22 while domestic flights were prohibited from March 25. The current lockdown period is scheduled till May 3 for now.There will be a need for coordination with the respective state governments and local administration to ensure availability of proper public transport and private taxies for passengers and airline staff to reach airports. “Also, coordinate with the respective local administration to ensure that petrol and diesel is adequately available for sustaining operations at airports,” it noted. Initially, watch hours will also continue to be limited. “However, the watch hours will be restored to original pre-Covid-19 timings gradually once normalcy is restored,” the SOP stated. “Airlines are required to file their schedule with the DGCA and simultaneously apply for slots at CHQ for approval well in advance to operate within the limited watch hours to be made available at airports, as initially the Summer 2020 schedule cannot be fully implemented. The slots will be provided for ensuring staggered operation based on capacity restriction of terminal buildings to facilitate required social distancing,” the SOP said. Recommencement of international flights should be also done in a similar coordinated manner, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flights-to-begin-in-limited-capacity-at-airports-post-lockdown-aai/story-nb9R44Yl6JMgThveQufYtL.html
