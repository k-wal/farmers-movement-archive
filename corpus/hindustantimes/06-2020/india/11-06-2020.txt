The school’s teachers had selected it as a reference book. Two teachers have already been suspended,” said Chatterjee on Thursday.On May 25, George Floyd, a black man was killed when a white Minneapolis officer pressed his knee on his neck. The incident triggered a wave of protests in the US and other countries.The book called Child’s Study was being taught in the pre-primary section of Burdwan Municipal Girls’ School.“As the English book was meant for children studying in pre-primary section, it used pictures to illustrate each alphabet. For example an apple’s picture was used to illustrate the alphabet ‘A’. When it came to ‘U’ a black man’s picture was used alongside the word ‘ugly’ written below. The picture of an umbrella was also used to illustrate the alphabet U,” said an official of the state education department.The school’s teachers who were involved in selecting the book have apologized saying they overlooked the picture.“It is a very unfortunate incident. The teachers have apologized. They should have been more careful,” said S Mullick, the headmistress of the school.

Anyway, it is a good decision but many stand exposed in the process,” the CM said without naming anyone. The government had called a meeting after the temple board and the priest differed over the opening of the hill shrine. “We have decided not to allow devotees in view of the fluid situation. There are no differences between the priest family and the Travancore Devaswom Board,” said state devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran after the meeting.The minister blamed cheap politics behind the confusion and the prolonged drama.Tantri Kandararu Mohanararu also played down differences over the issue, saying it was ideal not to allow devotees at this juncture. He cited the increase in the coronavirus cases in Kerala and the neighbouring states behind his decision. However, all daily poojas will be held at the shrine as per tantric customs. The temple was planning to open on June 14 and a week-long festival was to follow from June 19.The BJP termed the move a victory of the believers and said the government was forced to defer its decision. “The state government’s ploy to put the blame on the Centre was defeated. It always eyed temple income not the safety of devotees,” said state president K Surendran.Earlier, the government said it took the decision as per the directive of the Union home ministry. The TDB, a government-appointed body, runs Sabarimala and other major temples in south and central Kerala.Meanwhile the state has reported 83 fresh cases taking the total to 2244, said the CM adding that out of 84 cases 27 are expatriates, 37 came from other states and 14 infected from primary contacts.Five health workers and four cleaning employees are among the infected, he said.

Expenses for journeys that are paid for but not undertaken are borne by the secretariat. In a communication to all MPs on Thursday, the secretariat pointed out that non-cancellation of bookings, which are not actually utilised will have to be paid for by the MPs.The decision comes in the wake of the secretariat stemming losses incurred on paying for journeys not undertaken.“It has, however, been noted from the details of debit claims raised by the Ministry of Railways that multiple bookings are being made by some members in various trains departing from same/different stations to different destination stations for the same day. Rajya Sabha Secretariat has to make payments to the Ministry of Railways even for those bookings which are actually not utilised by the Members,” the secretariat said in the letter to MPs.Urging members to cancel in time, the communication signed by secretary general Desh DeepaK Verma said, “…Members would appreciate that non-performance of journey on reserved berths and non-cancellation thereof in time lead to unnecessary expenditure and avoidable drain on Rajya Sabha budget. It also put the public to inconvenience as they fail to get confirmed berths/seats.” As per the rules of Salary, Allowances and Pension of Members of Parliament Act, 1954, every member shall be provided with one free non-transferable first class air-conditioned or executive class of any train pass which shall entitle him to travel at any time by any railway in India; and one free air-conditioned two-tier class railway pass for one person to accompany the member when he travels by rail; and free travel by any railway in India in first class air-conditioned or executive class in any train with the spouse, if any, of the member from any place in India to any other place in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajya-sabha-secretariat-tells-mps-to-cancel-train-bookings-in-time-or-pay/story-lj5crGeoJmPNxuYPdgIwNI.html
11-06-2020||India||SC asks states to report on safety measures to protect kids from Covid-19 in child care homes||With 35 children of a government-run child care home in Tamil Nadu getting infected with Covid-19, the Supreme Court on Thursday took it as a wakeup call to take stock of the preventive measures being undertaken by states to prevent such a spread in child care institutions (CCI) across the country. Two months ago, the top court on April 3, had warned of such a scenario and directed a slew of steps to be undertaken by all states.Viewing the incident as a possible lapse on the part of the Tamil Nadu government, the bench of Justices LN Rao, Krishna Murari, and S Ravindra Bhatt ordered the Health Secretary of the state to prepare a report on the incident and submit it to the court before Monday, the next date of hearing. From media reports, the court gathered that the warden working at the child care home got infected and passed it on to the children.The bench said, “We want to know why precautions were not taken in respect of our April 3 order and what steps are now in place to protect the remaining child inmates.” The home situated at Royapuram, Chennai had some 57 children. Following the incident, the remaining children were shifted to an adjoining facility.The incident threw up several questions among the judges. The bench remarked, “We are not sure whether our orders (of April 3) are being implemented.” In that order, the court had directed the Juvenile Justice Committees (JJC) of every High Court to ensure all CCIs carry out “regular hand washing with safe water and soap, alcohol rub/hand sanitizers or chlorine solution.” As a minimum requirement, all CCIs were to have daily disinfection and cleaning of various surfaces.In addition, the court had directed that “staff or any other individual found to be exhibiting symptoms of Covid-19 should not be permitted to enter the CCI.” The CCIs had to conduct regular screening of children and staff and check for symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath.To ensure strict compliance of these orders, the bench came out with a questionnaire and directed states to circulate the same to all JJCs. “The JJCs will ensure states provide information sought for in the questionnaire and submit responses…..We would like to get feedback of states on care and protection of children in various child protection homes.” The court will take up the matter next on July 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-states-to-report-on-safety-measures-to-protect-kids-from-covid-19-in-child-care-homes/story-0WByp8kYK8glAIH1FB5l8M.html
11-06-2020||India||Karnataka to let non farmers buy farmland to boost corporate farming||The Karnataka government has decided to remove restrictions governing the purchase of farmland in the state through amendments to the Karnataka Land Reforms Act (KLRA) 1961 and section 109. The government has said that it would cement this far-reaching policy decision by soon bringing a legislation before the assembly.Briefing the media after the cabinet meeting, minister of law, parliamentary affairs and legislation J C Madhuswamy said the proposed amendments to sections 5, 63, 79A, 79B and 80 of KLRA would enable anybody to directly purchase farmland in the state.Till now, only farmers were allowed to directly purchase farmland. Even industry had to go through agencies like the Karnataka Industrial Area Development Board (KIADB) to acquire land. It was not possible for private businesses to acquire land even for corporate farming.Also Read: Karnataka’s Covid-19 tally surges to 6,041 with 120 new casesThe state government expects the amendments will bring in a reform giving industries easier access to farmland and better price discovery opportunities to farmers looking to sell their land without middlemen.Explaining the rationale for the amendments, Madhuswamy said, “Ever since the law was enforced in 1974 about 83171 cases have been registered with regard to farmland sale and acquisition disputes. The law has been used to just harass both sellers and buyers.”He claimed that the neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, TN, Kerala, Maharashtra and several other states across India didn’t restrict the sale of farmland.For Coronavirus Live Updates“This law was only being misused, so, to prevent that, we have brought in these amendments,” Madhuswami said.The minister also claimed that several citizens in the urban areas wanted to invest and take up farming. “Why should we prevent them? Our people are going and buying land in neighbouring states, why can’t they invest in their own state which will help both farm landowners who want to sell and the government hopefully will get some revenue,” he reasoned.He claimed that Karnataka had 98.95 lakh hectares of agricultural land including 22 lakh hectares that were not being used for farming. He said the amendments will help unlock farm land for better utilization. As per the proposed amendment, if the district deputy commissioner doesn’t give permission within a month of an application being submitted, it will be deemed to have been granted automatically.With these amendments, earlier barriers like ceiling on income, the quantum of landholding and non-leasing of agricultural land will be removed.These measures are being seen as chief minister Yediyurappa’s continued push to attract investments to the state. A special task force to lure companies wanting to exit China and invest in the state is being headed by the Chief Secretary T M Vijay Bhaskar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-to-let-non-farmers-buy-farmland-to-boost-corporate-farming/story-9OblOZA1j5hTpstKDqf32L.html

Britain’s stance gave rise to speculation that the 64-year-old businessman, wanted in India to face charges of financial irregularities, could have applied for asylum in the UK.Asked about the possibility of Mallya applying for asylum on humanitarian grounds and a timeline for his extradition, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly news briefing: “After Vijay Mallya’s leave to appeal to the [UK] Supreme Court, that application was rejected, we have been in touch with the UK side for his early extradition.“And we have also requested the UK side not to consider his asylum, if requested by him, because there appear to be no ground for his persecution in India.”Mallya lost his appeal against the 2018 order to extradite him in the UK high court in April. Last month, the high court also refused Mallya permission to appeal in the UK Supreme Court.He is wanted in India to face charges of financial offences involving Rs 9,000 crore borrowed by his now-defunct Kingfisher Airlines from several Indian banks.People familiar with developments, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the UK side had no further comments on Mallya’s case beyond the statement made by the spokesperson of the British high commission on June 4, and this position was in line with long-standing policy.The British mission’s spokesperson had said that “there is a further legal issue that needs resolving before Mr Mallya’s extradition can be arranged”. The spokesperson had added, Under United Kingdom law, extradition cannot take place until it is resolved. The issue is confidential and we cannot go into any detail.”The spokesperson had also declined to “estimate how long this issue will take to resolve”, and said: “We are seeking to deal with this as quickly as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-not-consider-vijay-mallya-s-asylum-request-india-messages-uk/story-z67fMt5NLMsmt73jAWVGoM.html
11-06-2020||India||Fear of community transmission in northeast’s gateway Guwahati||The Assam government is concerned about possible community spread of Covid-19 in Guwahati, the northeast region’s biggest city, after 13 people without any travel or contact history tested positive for the Coronavirus.“We are a bit worried about Guwahati. Till Wednesday, we have found nearly 13 Covid-19 cases in the community level,” state health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on Wednesday, after a fresh case without any history of travel or contacts with other infected people was detected at Hari Sabha in the Panbazar neighbourhood of the city.Earlier, two similar cases were detected in the same area, a hub of wholesale medicine dealers for the region. Guwahti’s first Covid-19 case, detected in April, was a businessman with no history of travel or contacts with infected people.The possibility of community spread in Guwahati, which has a population of nearly 2.3 million and is the gateway to other northeastern states, has worried Assam’s health department and the local administration. “We will have to collect more samples from areas where cases with no history have been detected. We have to enforce strict containment for around seven days in order to break the chain of transmission,” Sarma said.There are currently 26 containment zones spread across Guwahati, three of them declared on Wednesday following the detection of fresh cases.Biswajit Pegu, the deputy commissioner of Kamrup (metro), said: “We have identified some areas in the city where localised cases have been recorded. These are contiguous areas. If we enforce lockdown in those areas and conduct tests on a large scale, we may be able to cut the chain of spread.“We are contemplating conducting community surveillance in those areas and checks for residents having fever and respiratory problems. A decision will be taken soon.”Assam has recorded more than 3,300 Covid-19 cases till Thursday afternoon. There have been 1,250 recoveries and six deaths.“We have had a few cases with no history of travel, contact or exposure. The cases in Guwahati are not huge, not detected within a day or in a same locality. But a pattern is emerging of people who are symptomatic who got tested on their own and were detected as positive,” said S Lakshmanan, director, National Health Mission (NHM) Assam“Definitely it’s a matter of worry. The number of cases may not be sufficient to say that community spread has already happened. But the fear is very real. People need to be extra careful and follow social distancing and other safety measures to prevent spread,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fear-of-community-transmission-in-northeast-s-gateway-guwahati/story-wmSoaIg2bYBfjJd3DxAfyI.html
11-06-2020||India||Amid spike in Covid-19 cases, 3 states seek isolation coaches from railways||Amid rising Covid-19 cases, the Delhi, Telangana and Uttar Pradesh governments have sought help from the railways for allocating coronavirus isolation coaches prepared by the national carrier, the railway ministry said on Thursday. The demand for the special coaches has come nearly two months after they were prepared.Trains with a composition of 10 coaches and patient capacity of 16 people have been made ready. A total of 5,231 coaches were modified to be used as ‘Covid Care Centres, the ministry said. The first such Covid Care Centres was deployed at Shakur Basti railway station in New Delhi on May 31 consisting of 10 non-AC coaches with 160 beds and three AC coaches, for healthcare staffers, including doctors.This comes at a time when the national capital till Thursday reported 31,309 Covid-19 positive cases and 905 deaths, while Uttar Pradesh has 11,335 positive cases with 301 deaths and Telangana 3,920 positive cases with 148 deaths.The UP government has asked for Covid coaches to be stationed across 24 locations with a minimum of 10 coaches as Covid Care Centres at railway stations including Varanasi City, Jhansi, Gorakhpur, Gonda, Bareilly City, Saharanpur, Sonbhadra and Azamgarh among other stations. Telangana has sought 60 Covid coaches to be stationed at three locations; Secunderabad, Kachiguda and Adilabad and 10 coaches have been stationed at Delhi’s Shakur Basti station, officials said.“Sustaining the fight against Covid-19, Indian Railways is making an all out effort to supplement the health care efforts of the Government of India. Indian Railways has geared up to provide its 5,231 Covid Care Centers to the state. Zonal Railways has converted these coaches for quarantine facility,” the ministry said on Thursday. “The coaches can be used for very mild cases that can be clinically assigned to the Covid Care Centres as per guidelines issued by the MoHFW. These coaches can be used in areas where the state has exhausted the facilities and needs to augment capacities for isolation of both suspected and confirmed Covid-19 cases. These facilities are part of the integrated Covid-19 plan developed by MoHFW and Niti Aayog,” it added. The coaches that had been languishing for nearly two months with no takers were also deployed by the railway board to be used for Shramik Special trains. The railway board had written to zones in May seeking to take back 60% of the Covid-19 coaches to be utilised as Shramik trains.“The board desires that 60 per cent of isolation coaches (amounting to 3,120 coaches) meant for intervention of Covid-19 cases, railways may utilise them for running of Shramik Special trains. It is permitted by board,” the order issued on May 21 said.The national carrier had initially decided to convert 5,000 coaches for over 80,000 patients and later had said it will convert 20,000 coaches for over 3.16 lakh Covid-19 patients.The Centre in May had drafted a plan to deploy 5,231 railway coaches as isolation wards across 215 stations in 15 states “considering the possibility of an increase in cases of Covid-19.”“Out of 215 stations, the Railways will provide healthcare facilities in 85 stations, in 130 stations, states to request Covid Care Coaches only if they agree to provide staff and essential medicines. Indian Railways has kept 158 stations ready with watering and charging facility and 58 stations with watering facility for these Covid Care Centres,” the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases-3-states-seek-isolation-coaches-from-railways/story-kcSRCGKZ4PZggLArAfVk6O.html
11-06-2020||India||Assam gas well fire continues to rage on; extent contained to the well||The fire at the natural gas well of Oil India Limited (OIL) at Upper Assam’s Baghjan in Tinsukia district is still raging on Thursday amid fears of widespread damage to the eco-sensitive area, two days after a blaze broke out and claimed two firefighters’ lives while attempts were underway to plug uncontrolled gas and condensate release.The fire billowed to nearly 100 feet above the well, located barely a kilometre away from the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and the eco-sensitive Maguri Motapung wetland, situated a few hundred metres from the site.While the fire had spread to a nearby village and destroyed over 50 houses and many trees on Tuesday and Wednesday, the blaze was largely contained on the third day, according to OIL authorities.“The extent of the fire has been contained to the well. No flash fire is reported from nearby areas on Thursday,” OIL said in a statement on Thursday.The well, which had a blowout – an uncontrolled release of gas or oil when pressure systems fail – on May 27, caught fire on June 9 and two firefighters, who were engaged in spraying water to the well to prevent the “uncontrolled” release of gas and condensate from catching fire, lost their lives.The OIL statement said that the team of experts from the Singapore-based firm, Alert Disaster Control, which specialises in controlling blowouts, is preparing a road map to control the fire and plug the uncontrolled release of gas. The experts had arrived on Monday, a day before the fire broke out.“The area near the well has to be first cleared. One option is to drill another well close to the site and connect it with the blowout well to divert the gas. Then, a blowout preventer (BOP), a large valve weighing up to three tonnes, can be used to cap the old well,” said a retired drilling expert, requesting anonymity. The process could take several weeks, he added.Earlier in 2005, when an abandoned oil well of OIL caught fire in Assam’s Dikom, it took around six weeks to control it.OIL officials said that it would take about four weeks for the blowout to be plugged.The process required a large amount of water, which needs to be poured on the wellhead to control the spread of fire.The officials said that a high discharge water pump would be placed to contain the spread of the fire.On Thursday, the Assam government ordered an inquiry into the blowout and subsequent fire. Maninder Singh, additional chief secretary (ACS), Assam, has been asked to submit a report within 15 days.“We want the inquiry to ascertain how did the blowout happen and if there was a human error, which led to it, and the subsequent fire that broke out,” Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal said on Thursday.The industrial disaster has led to protests by local student organisations, who have alleged that OIL’s mismanagement triggered the blowout, forcing the state-run oil firm to suspend their drilling operations at three locations and no work could be carried out in eight sites across Assam on Wednesday.“OIL lost 467 metric tonnes of crude oil production from 59 producing wells on June 10 due to blockade by local people and various student organisations,” an OIL statement said.The incident has raised questions about the role of John Energy, a Gujarat-based company that was conducting a workover operation at the well under the supervision of OIL when the blowout occurred.Workover is an intervention in an existing oil or natural gas well that requires invasive techniques such as wireline, coil tubing, or snubbing.The Baghjan well was producing one lakh standard cubic metre per day (SCMD) of gas at a depth of 3,870 metres. The blowout occurred when the workover operation was underway to produce gas from new sand (oil and gas-bearing reservoir) at a depth of 3,729 metres.An OIL employee alleged on condition of anonymity that when the blowout occurred several senior and mid-level officials and senior employees of John Energy were not present at the site.On Wednesday, OIL authorities had suspended two officials on charges of dereliction of their duties during the blowout.“The company is carrying out an internal inquiry and two officials responsible for the well have been placed under suspension. The probe will reveal if they were responsible or not,” said Tridiv Hazarika, spokesperson, OIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-gas-well-fire-continues-to-rage-on-extent-contained-to-the-well/story-6TiisoODHOCXcpD5RLxhsJ.html

11-06-2020||India||PM Modi to launch auction for commercial coal mining next week||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on June 18 launch the auction of coal mines for commercial mining at an event here via video conferencing. The launch of auction will be with the theme “Unleashing coal: New hopes for Aatmanirbhar Bharat”, the coal ministry said in a statement. “We are launching first-ever commercial coal auctions in country on 18th June. Event will be graced by PM @NarendraModi Ji. It is his vision & guidance to make #AtmaNirbharBharat in coal. I am proud that we are well on our way to achieve it,” Coal Minister Pralhad Joshi said in a tweet. As India has recently embraced the Aatma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan, the coal and mining sector has started gearing up to make the country self-reliant in coal mining through structural reforms, the ministry said. The commercial coal mining auction is completely different from the earlier regime of restricted sectors, use and price. Now there are no such restrictions at all. The proposed auction has business-friendly terms and conditions, including reduced upfront amount, adjustment of upfront amount against royalty and liberal efficiency parameters to encourage flexibility to operationalise the coal mines. Besides, 100 per cent FDI through automatic route has been allowed and there are reasonable financial terms and revenue sharing model based on National Coal Index. The successful bidders will also have flexibility in coal production unlike the past and have provision for incentives for early production and coal gasification. Around 50 coal blocks are likely to be auctioned for commercial coal mining, a source had said earlier. The mines to be put up for auction would be in three categories -- small, medium and large. Some of the mines would come into production within a year of being auctioned, the source had added. The government had last month approved a methodology for commercial mining of coal on revenue sharing basis. The decision was taken during a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs (CCEA), chaired by the Prime Minister. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, while announcing the stimulus package for the coronavirus-hit economy, had said coal mines would be auctioned to the private sector for commercial mining to end reliance on imports and improve local production. The methodology approved by CCEA provides that bid parameter will be revenue share, the government had said, adding that bidders would be required to bid for a percentage share of revenue payable to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-launch-auction-for-commercial-coal-mining-next-week/story-Yei1NA4iK08h9NPG6RJWvL.html

After several failed attempts in 2019, the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) recently succeeded in carrying heavy road building equipment by helicopters to Laspa, raising hopes of the road’s faster completion, BRO Chief Engineer Bimal Goswami said.The absence of heavy stone cutting equipment at Laspa near the alignment site of the 65-km road had delayed its construction. The Munsiyari-Bogdiyar- Milam road, which is being constructed in the high Himalayan region of Johar Valley in the state’s Pithoragarh district, will be a link to the last posts on the Indo-China border. “After several unsuccessful attempts last year, we succeeded this month in landing helicopters carrying heavy machines to Laspa. We now hope that cutting work of the challenging stretch will be completed in the next three years, Goswami said.Cutting of hard rocks, which are standing straight on a 22-km portion of the road, will now become easy as heavy machines can be transported by helicopters to the spot.  “Construction of the road was started in 2010 with an amount of Rs 325 crore sanctioned for the project, the BRO chief engineer said.He said the road is being constructed from both ends and except the 22-km hard portion, cutting work has been completed on 40 km of the road.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/helicopters-land-heavy-equipment-to-expedite-work-of-strategic-road-near-india-china-border/story-jJVwwWz8sQ9dpth2MhcPhJ.html

11-06-2020||India||Indian researchers develop new low-cost RT-nPCR test for coronavirus detection||Researchers at the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) have developed a new test to detect coronavirus named reverse transcription nested PCR (RT-nPCR) test based on a low-cost and low-tech model, said a Thursday release from union science and technology ministry.The main Covid testing protocol currently sanctioned by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is called RT-qPCR tests, which expands to mean reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and according to the ministry, the newly developed test has given comparable results with the standard RT-qPCR test.“This test does not require real-time quantitative RT-qPCR. The RT-nPCR developed by the CCMB research team has shown comparable performance to the standard RT-qPCR test. The nested PCR (RT-nPCR) approach does not depend on RT-qPCR but uses standard RT-PCR as part of an endpoint assay,’’ a statement from the ministry said of the new testing protocol.Less than 1% have Covid-19 infection, says ICMR’s 15-district sero surveyWhile comparing the results of both types of tests, researchers found that the standard RT-qPCR test can have low detection efficiency-- less than 50%--in a real testing environment. It was attributed sometimes to low viral load in many samples. The new RT-nPCR test was able to make positive detections even in samples found to be negative in two RT-qPCR tests, the statement says. “It also detected 13% samples as positive among samples that were negative by the standard RT-qPCR test (likely false negatives). Based on the experimentally measured false negative rate by RT-nPCR tests from this study, it was estimated that as many as 50% of positive samples may escape detection in single pass testing by RT-qPCR in an actual testing scenario,” the statement from the ministry states.It must be added though that RT-nPCR test was able to identify 90% of the positive samples detected together by both standard RT-qPCR tests.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe experiment was conducted using the RNA isolated from nasopharyngeal swab samples previously tested using one of the two RT-qPCR tests.“This finding brought home the importance of monitoring detection efficiency directly in test environments,” the ministry says.This new test is awaiting approval from ICMR and the lab that developed the new test says that RT-nPCR test could be deployed in those places where RT-qPCR test machines are not available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-researchers-develop-new-low-cost-rt-npcr-test-for-coronavirus-detection/story-HRg6Hbj17ocg7dbgJtlMCM.html

You gave your time to work as an aged-care worker throughout that time [pandemic],” Gilchrist thanked Sharon on behalf of the Australian society, in a video released by the Australian Trade and Investment Commission, a government agency to promote business and education down under.Lauding the contributions of foreign students and workers in the country at the time of the pandemic, he added: “Just want to let you know, all of Australia, all of India and more importantly your family will be very proud of your efforts.” Adam Gilchrist gives a shout out to Sharon Vergese a nurse from @UOW who has been working as an #agedcare worker during #COVID-19. https://t.co/NfT0Q7G6P8To discover more stories like this follow #InAusTogether #InThisTogether. #studyaustralia @gilly381 @AusHCIndia @dfatLater, Verghese told an online portal that she was really bowled over by the legendary wicket keeper and batsman’s congratulatory note. She said her father was a big cricket fan and these words made him really proud.Sharon, who came to Australia in 2016, hails from Kottayam in central Kerala. Her friends said after completing nursing graduation from the University of Wollongong she has been working at an aged care home there.During the pandemic, Australia has given special care to aged homes and isolated them to prevent a possible infection. Speaking to a Malayalam news channel, Sharon said she wanted to work in a Covid hospital but got an opportunity in an aged care home, but really enjoyed her stint there. She now plans to pursue her masters in nursing. The United Nurses Association (UNA) has lauded the young nurse, adding that out of 20 lakh registered nurses at least 15 lakh are from Kerala.“At least two lakh of our nurses are abroad. Besides the Gulf, they are also in the US, Australia and other countries. Nurses from Kerala are most sought after because service is in their blood,” said UNA general secretary Sujanapal Achuththan.Last month the state had rushed 1,000 medical workers, mostly trained critical care nurses, to the UAE and Saudi Arabia as requested by them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/adam-gilchrist-s-shout-out-to-kerala-nurse-in-australia-during-covid-crisis/story-kiJJBCcckEXxSe2mzUwQKM.html
11-06-2020||India||In Rajasthan, Unlock 1 sees surge in Covid-19 cases, over 2,600 cases added in 10 days||With restrictions easing under Unlock 1.0, Covid-19 cases in Rajasthan have surged by over 2,600 in the first 10 days of June, prompting a worried government to clamp down on inter-state movement.Between June 1, when Unlock 1.0 came into force and restrictions were eased on travel, malls, hotels, offices and restaurants, and June 10, Covid-19 positive cases in the state have risen by 2620.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot has also expressed concern about the rise in coronavirus cases.He said the government will regulate inter-state movement as people are not getting tested or they get tested but reports come after they travel, which is leading to the spread of the infection.Health minister Raghu Sharma said the health department is studying the causes for this unprecedented rise in coronavirus cases.“After Unlock 1, it has come to our notice that people are violating the guidelines. They are gathering in crowds, not maintaining social distance and not wearing masks. At this rate, infection will rise,” he said.He said the government will not shy away from strict measures to control the spread of the virus as this was in the people’s interest.Sharma also stressed that the state has a commendable recovery rate of 75 percent while the mortality rate is low at 2.25 percent. The rate of doubling of cases is 22 days, he said adding that overall the situation in the state is under control and some harsh steps are being taken to keep the situation under control.Dr Sudhir Bhandari, SMS Medical College principal said the main reason for the spike in cases is carelessness by people.“After the lockdown ended, people have become careless and casual. They are not adhering to social protocols such as social distancing, hand hygiene and wearing of masks. As restrictions are relaxed, everyone should cooperate and be careful,” he said.The health department data shows that from April 1 to May 1, the total increase in cases was 2,541. Between May 1 and June 1, the number of cases rose by 6,363. On May 1, the total cases were 2,617 and on June 1, the total cases were 8,980.Data shows that between May and June, almost 40 percent of cases were those of migrants who started returning to the state from end of April.Of the total 6,363 positive cases between May and June, 2,543 or 39.9 percent were migrants.On June 1, the total number of Covid-19 positive cases stood at 8,980 and on June 10, this increased to 11,600, an addition of 2,620 cases.The total number of migrants who have tested Covid-19 positive in this period is 735. On June 1, the number of Covid-19 positive migrant cases was 2,543 which rose to 3,278 on June 10.A majority of the Covid-19 positive cases in these 10 days have been reported from Bharatpur, Alwar, Baran, Jaipur, Jodhpur and Pali districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-rajasthan-unlock-1-sees-surge-in-covid-19-cases-over-2-600-cases-added-in-10-days/story-O1OOKwNtRdBfhHinnTwOKK.html
11-06-2020||India||Put new gas wells on hold until OIL has a disaster plan: Wildlife Institute||A preliminary report by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) on the environmental damage caused due to Oil India Limited’s (OIL) gas well blowout at Baghjan in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district, which started on May 27, has found that oil has leaked into adjoining Lohit river, polluting the water and adjoining Maguri-Motapung wetland with toxic pollutants. Maguri-Motapung is located less than 10 km from Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and is a part of the Dibru-Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve (DSBR). The report, which has been submitted to the Union Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC) and seen by HT, has recommended that the approved new wells and further exploration in the area should be put on hold until OIL authorities put in place their disaster-handling capabilities.The report said a WII team conducted the survey from May 29 to June 4 and found several dead fish and insects that may have died due to oxygen depletion in the water following the oil spill.The survey found the presence of at least five endangered Gangetic dolphins in the 20-kilometre stretch of the Lohit river, a tributary of the Brahmaputra river, indicating that the species will be at grave risk from the ongoing spill. The team has collected samples of tissue and blubber from a Gangetic dolphin carcass found in Maguri beel, which is being analysed for presence of various contaminants.“The toxic fumes and oil coating has universally affected the area’s flora and fauna. The contaminants and oil are continuing to be released in the surrounding areas and immediate steps are needed to contain this spillover. The released toxins are known to have long-term persistence in soils and sediments, which will not only affect current life conditions, but due to sustained release, pose a serious health risk for a longer-term,” the report said.The WII team has also gathered from the local residents that OIL authorities did not have a mitigation plan for such a disaster, and consequently suggested a comprehensive impact assessment of their field operations in the biodiversity-rich Dibru Saikhowa National Park.“It’d be not only prudent but also essential for the well-being of all life forms that the approved new wells and further explorations in this area should be initiated only after a thorough investigation of potential impact, as well as evaluating disaster handling capabilities in place, with appropriate technology and trained manpower,” the report added.WII has flagged that the environmental impacts of the oil spill will linger on for long.This is because an oil well blowout spews hundreds of chemical particles in the air, water, and soil. The hydrocarbon component comprises hundreds of organic compounds, many of which are hazardous when released into the environment such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that are also carcinogenic.Local residents have complained of severe difficulty in breathing, headache and nausea to the visiting WII team, who, too, experienced similar symptoms due to the oil spill.The entire landscape, including the wetland, is coated in layers of oil, according to the team.The area, where blowout has taken place, is rich in biodiversity and one of the important remaining refuges for several endangered and range-restricted species, the report said.DSBR is home to tiger, elephant, wild buffalo, leopard, hoolock gibbon, capped langur, slow loris, Ganges River dolphin besides critically endangered bird species such as the Bengal florican, white-winged wood duck, greater adjutant stork, white-rumped vulture, slender-billed vulture as well as the very rare and endemic black-breasted parrotbill.The report has also pointed out that the entire region has undergone frequent changes in morphology due to recurrent earthquakes, which are known to have caused extensive landslides and ground fissuring, making the area disaster-prone.On May 11, the MoEFCC had granted environmental clearance to OIL for extension pf drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations under Dibru Saikhowa National Park.“The lowland forests of the region are unique. We’ve found leakages from other wells as well and they can have long-lasting impacts. We’ve recommended a thorough assessment of disaster mitigation possibilities before implementing further exploration projects,” said Qamar Qureshi, a scientist at WII.WII will come out with a detailed report on the impact on biodiversity by the end of June.“The wetland is affected, especially the aquatic species. The national park is slightly away from the accident site. We’re waiting for the detailed WII study and response from the Assam forest department. We’ve already written to them,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director-general (wildlife), MoEFCC.“We aren’t aware of the WII report. Whatever condensed oil had been released earlier has been burnt off. There’s no contamination from that spill anymore. We’re trying to contain the releasing gas within four weeks,” said an OIL spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/put-new-gas-wells-on-hold-until-oil-has-a-disaster-plan-wildlife-institute/story-6HMCWjkuKJZYGlTOfQgNKN.html

According to the results shared by ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), less than one per cent of the population – 0.73%--in non-containment zone districts was found to have contracted the deadly contagion.A sero-survey is conducted by testing the blood serum of a group of people in a community to detect the presence of antibodies in the system which aids in finding out the prevalence of a disease. ICMR said it conducted sero-survey in districts to monitor the spread of Sars-Cov-2 virus. This testing allows the health authorities to study the trend of the infection and ascertain if it has reached the community transmission phase. ALSO WATCH | ‘Risk higher in urban areas’: ICMR reveals sero-survey findingsICMR said the sero-surveys were conducted in two parts, and the first part comprising a fraction of the general population, who had contracted Sars-Cov-2, had been completed.The sero-survey was conducted using both anti-body/instant test and the lengthier RT-PCR test, to detect current virus carriers and also those who recovered after contracting the disease.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesAccording to its findings, the risk of people contracting the virus in urban slums was 1.89 times higher than the rural areas, while the risk in other urban areas was 1.09 times higher compared to rural areas.ICMR said that the study also revealed that the infection fatality rate was very low at 0.08 per cent.According to the council, the findings demonstrated that the nationwide lockdown and adjutant restrictions had been successful in keeping the rate of coronavirus spread low.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19However, in a corollary to the above findings, the ICMR said that a large proportion of India’s population was still susceptible to the disease. Part 2 of the sero-survey was to estimate the fraction of population infected with the virus in containment zones of hotspot cites and it is still ongoing, said ICMR.These sero-surveys were started by ICMR in May 2020, in collaboration with state health departments, NCDC, and the World Health Organisation (WHO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/less-than-1-of-population-outside-containment-zones-infected-by-coronavirus-icmr/story-btv5RFF1mwjeLygPl85ibI.html

11-06-2020||India||3 elephants found dead in 3 days in north Chhattisgarh, cause of death still unclear||The carcass of one more female wild elephant was found in the jungles of Rajpur in Balrampur district of Surguja on Thursday morning taking the toll to three in the last three days.Two female wild elephants were found dead in the jungles of Pratapur forest range of Surajpur on Tuesday and Wednesday. Officials believe that all the three female elephants were from the same herd.“The body has been found in Rajpur forest range of Balrampur district on Thursday morning. We are yet to conduct the third post-mortem, however, the postmortem of the two other elephants have been conducted and prima facie doctors told us that the death was due to toxicity” said Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) Arun Kumar Pandey talking to Hindustan Times adding that complete reports are awaited.“All three were young animals and they could not die like this at this age hence we suspect that these are not natural deaths,” said Pandey adding that no injury mark was found on the elephants.Meanwhile, forest officials have also collected samples from nearby ponds and water bodies to check if it was poisoned. “We don’t think that they have been poisoned through water bodies because then many deaths of wild animals would have taken place,” said Pandey.Two carcasses of elephants were found in separate places of Pratapur forest range of the district on Wednesday and Tuesday and the post-mortem report of both the elephants is still pending.A herd of some 18 elephants had ransacked some mud houses in Karwa village before moving toward Pratapur on June 6-7.“As per preliminary information, this herd was coming from Rajpur and then moved towards Pratapur. Near Rajpur they entered a village where they destroyed some mud houses. We are also investigating the villages which the herd crossed to ascertain what they have eaten,” a senior official said.Earlier, the forest department told HT that it seems that the pregnant elephant died due to cardiovascular failure and some cysts were also found in her body. However, the exact cause of death will come out after the post-mortem report, which will arrive on Thursday.Forest officials believe the dead jumbos belonged to the herd of elephants roaming in the area since the last one month.North Chhattisgarh is home to around 240 wild elephants, which roam in the coal rich forest lands in Surguja region of the state. Several reports of human-elephant conflicts have surfaced in last few years in the region.Amalendu Mishra, member of the State Wildlife Advisory Board, who tracks elephant movement in Surguja region said, “In this region there are about 90 out the total 240 wild elephants in Chhattisgarh. There is much need of training and capacity building of forest department’s ground staff for the management of wild elephants.”According to Mishra, for tracking the live movement of elephants, the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) was radio collaring the pachyderms. However, currently only 3 out of 240 wild elephants have been radio collared.He further says when it comes to wild elephant deaths in Surguja region the deaths are mostly due to random reasons. For example, people lay live wires in jungles for trapping wild boars or for saving crops and elephants get electrocuted.“Though there has been a slow increase in the numbers of wild elephants in Chhattisgarh, but as compared to a state like Karnataka it is still very less. Karnataka has about 6,000 elephants while in Chhattisgarh it is around 230-240 only,” he said.As per Chhattisgarh’s forest department figures, during the financial year 2018-19, a total of 56 people were killed by wild elephants in northern Chhattisgarh. In 2017-18, 74 people died due to elephant attacks in the state.“We have ordered a high-level probe into the deaths of these elephants which will be headed by former principal chief conservator of forest (PCCF),” Mohammad Akbar, Chhattisgarh’s forest minister told Hindustan Times.The minister further added that the first death was reported on Tuesday in Ganeshpur forest of Surajpur district and doctors have said that the elephant died due to cardiac issues.“The second death took place on Wednesday and the doctor said the elephant probably died due to toxicity but the post-mortem report is awaited. The post-mortem of the third elephant is yet to be done. A case of poisoning has not been detected in any of these deaths. We have also used sniffer dogs to detect any foul play but nothing has been found,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-elephants-found-dead-in-3-days-in-north-chhattisgarh-cause-of-death-still-unclear/story-wesxRF2leejO2LY4nytkbJ.html

The local police, CRPF and the army launched a joint operation in Pathanpora village of Budgam district after learning militants were present in the area. As the troops began surrounding the militants’ hideout, security forces exchanged fire with the militants.However, the militants escaped under cover of darkness. The operation continued till later on Thursday morning, and it was called off only when officials learnt the militants had evaded the security forces. A senior police officer, who declined to be named, said two Jaish-e-Mohammed militants managed to escape during the gun battle at Pathanpora. “The militants left some arms and ammunition behind before they escaped,” he said. An army spokesman said one suspect has been arrested and arms and ammunition were found at the spot. “The operation was launched on specific information and while the cordon was being laid, the terrorists managed to escape. One suspect has been apprehended and one Chinese pistol, a grenade, six magazines and 147 rounds of ammunition were recovered,’’ the army spokesman said.Since Monday, security forces have killed 14 militants, mostly locals, in three operations in south Kashmir’s Shopian district. The militants were buried 100 km away in Baramulla district. Police didn’t reveal the identities of the dead militants but said they were affiliated with the Hizbul Mujahideen, Jaish-e-Mohammed and Lashkar-e-Taiba. Police also said top commanders were among the dead militants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/budgam-militants-escape-during-encounter-leaving-arms-and-ammunition-behind-one-suspect-arrested/story-2tM4g2B4gNudrpX9PQjh7J.html
11-06-2020||India||No community transmission in India, says govt amid spike in Covid-19 cases||There is no community transmission of the coronavirus pandemic in India, the government said on Thursday amid intense speculation over the past week on the spike in cases, especially in Mumbai and Delhi. “India is such a large country and prevalence is very low. India is not in community transmission,” said Balram Bhargava, Director General, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The top medical body official underlined that lockdown measures were “successful” in preventing the rapid spread of the disease.“We found that about 0.73% of the population in these 15 districts showed a prevalence of past exposure to infection. It means that lockdown measures were successful in keeping it low and preventing rapid spread,” added Bhargava.Community transmission means that the disease is in its third stage and the source of its origin is not known. It is now present in the community and can infect people with no history - either of travel to or contact with infected people and areas. At this point, everyone is susceptible to catching it.In the first stage, the disease takes the form of a pandemic. The second stage is when the virus starts being transmitted locally. The third stage is that of community transmission.In Tamil Nadu, chief minister K Panaliswami said his government has been transparent in reporting Covid-19 deaths and none can hide information, rejecting claims of under-reporting of fatalities. He also asserted there was no community transmission of coronavirus in the state, which has reported 1,500 plus fresh cases for four successive days till Wednesday with the tally crossing the 36,000 mark.On Wednesday, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain reiterated that there was transmission in the community in Delhi, but it was up to the central government to declare “community transmission”. The Delhi minister, after a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Authority a day ago, had said that his government was unable to establish the source of infection in 50% of the cases of coronavirus disease in the city.The Delhi government also blamed the Centre for using the city’s airports to bring in people from other countries. “Delhi and Mumbai are the two cities where people were brought in from other nations via flights, and we warned the Centre against it but they did nothing to avoid the landing of flights in Delhi,” said Jain.The high number of cases in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai is indicative of community transmission, say experts.Some commentators say that India went into lockdown early. Other countries, they say, lifted their lockdown when their disease curve had started to deflate, but here the restrictions are being eased as the curve is going up exponentially.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-community-transmission-in-india-says-govt-amid-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-6nYUOGYr3RaOPu7eZVYFDL.html

But officials said that on their records, the hand pump or pipe was functioning properly, To overcome this discrepancy, I decided to send the officials to the field to assess the ground situation without waiting for complaints and demands from people to pile up,” said Poswal.For Coronavirus Live Updates“The usual complaints we get from people is that officials never visit the field, so we decided to send them to the field and do a reality check. They will listen to people and gather information about demands and complaints and then prepare a report based on that,” he said.Poswal said the administration’s objective is to solve the problems relating to drinking water in each revenue village through process of ground verification of the drinking water facilities.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The water audit will be done in all 214 gram panchayats of Rajsamand district, about 300 km south of Jaipur. The elected representatives along with the block and district level officials will be present at the time of the water audit.“The audit will be carried out when water is supplied, usually between 6 am and 9 am in the morning, in all the 214 gram panchayats,” said Poswal. The current per day demand of drinking water in Rajsamand district is 111 million litres.A form with a check-list has been created for all officials to be filled on the spot.It will register details about the existing drinking water system and the place-specific requirements for creating lacking infrastructure. The officials will take note of available sources of drinking water, time of water supply, quantity of water supplies, demand for water and the availability, the number of hand pumps, faulty handpumps, state of pipelines, state of water tanks, state of tube wells and identification of new water sources.Suggestions from people and elected representatives will also be taken before officials finalise their reports with their own analysis or comments and submit it to the DC. The reports will be reviewed by the chief executive officer and PHED officials before it is passed to the collector for a final decision.He said the data and suggestions received from people will help the administration review the present drinking water arrangement, demand, supply and create a plan to meet the future drinking water needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-s-rajsamand-takes-up-water-audit-to-fix-drinking-water-woes/story-dO7V05tkS0QwdU37rINauM.html

Conditions are now favourable for the advance of the Southwest Monsoon into some parts of the Central Arabian Sea and Maharashtra, remaining parts of Telangana, west central and North Bay of Bengal, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Meghalaya, Sikkim and, some more parts of Odisha and Gangetic West Bengal in the next 48 hours, the IMD indicated.“The Southwest Monsoon has set in over Odisha on Thursday. Widespread rainfall is expected over south and coastal Odisha districts and heavy to very heavy rainfall is expected in Koraput, Malkangiri, in the next 24 hours,” Director of IMD Bhubaneswar, HR Biswas said.“The monsoon has arrived in Odisha,” the Bhubaneswar Met Centre also said in a tweet.ALSO READ | Monsoon arrives in Maharashtra, coastal areas receive showersWith the advancement of the monsoon, heavy rainfall is likely to lash a few districts in Odisha over the next two days. The Met department’s prediction that the monsoon is likely to be normal this year has brought some relief to farmers in West Bengal and Odisha, hit hard this year by severe cyclonic storm Amphan which damaged standing crops in both states.The IMD Goa unit too announced on Thursday that the onset of monsoon in the state -- a week behind its schedule – had begun in parts of the Konkan coast and Maharashtra.The northern limit of the monsoon, which is lying at Karwar in neighbouring Karnataka and south of Goa, has covered all of Karnataka and entered parts of Maharashtra, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, the IMD said.The onset of the Southwest Monsoon is usually declared after necessary conditions have been met such as westerly winds blowing at a speed between 30 and 45 kilometres per hour (kmph) and widespread distribution of moderate to heavy rainfall over certain areas during the last 24 hours.IMD officials have also issued a red alert warning for Goa, as the state is expected to record extremely heavy rainfall measuring over 20.4 cm and 11.5 cm on Friday and Saturday, followed by an orange alert, or heavy rainfall, on Sunday.The IMD authorities expect this year’s monsoon to be normal in Goa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/southwest-monsoon-sets-in-over-odisha-coastal-districts-likely-to-get-heavy-rainfall/story-QGSsk96R8wUQok1ZusE2fP.html

So far, about 10,000 of the three lakh workers who had returned have gone back to other states after taking the medical certificates, the officials said.Murshidabad is among the biggest contributors to the migrant workforce from Bengal. Every day, people in different community blocks of the district can be seen in long queues outside government health centres to procure fitness certificates, a document that is helping them return to the very states they had to return from during the nationwide lockdown. A senior district health department official, on condition of anonymity, said, “Till Monday, 126 people in Murshidabad had tested positive for Covid-19 and more than 95% are migrant labourers. Had they not returned to their villages the virus might not have spread to remote areas so fast.”“Now that they have started returning to the states where they worked earlier, the disease is likely to spread as most of the carriers can be asymptomatic,” the health official added.Dr Utpal Majumdar, Bhagabangola-II community block medical officer of health, said,”Hundreds of migrant labourers are coming to Nashipur hospital to get fitness certificates from us so that they can return and join duty.“They were in home quarantine for a while. Those who have lived in quarantine for 14-28 days and have no symptoms of Covid-19 are being given certificates. We are collecting swab samples from those who have symptoms.”Several migrant workers HT talked to said some private companies even sent vehicles to take the workers back. Sixty people from the district’s Suti community block area hired a bus and left for Odisha on Monday. “I used to be the main mason at a construction site in Kerala and earn around Rs.800 a day. Here I am being offered Rs 200 for the same job. I will leave soon,” said Jafikur Sheikh, a wage labourer from Shamserganj. Nausad Alam,a resident of Hakimpur village, said: “I used to work at the workshop of a renowned jewellery company in Surat. I lost my job and I was worried about my family. I haven’t got any work here so far. I will leave in a day or two.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) state leadership alleged that chief minister Mamata Banerjee wanted to stop the return of the migrants as it would expose the lack of job opportunities in her state.“These people came home out of fear and under financial duress but they had to face indignity and insult. Mamata Banerjee can neither provide work to them nor keep them in proper quarantine facilities. Many have to spend nights in open fields,” said BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha. The leader also reminded that the chief minister dubbed the special trains ferrying migrants as “Corona express”. However, the Bengal CM said yesterday that she did not coin the term “Corona Express, but the people did”.Trinamool Congress (TMC) district leaders claimed that the migration has started again because the pandemic is under control.The sabhadhipati or head of the TMC-controlled zilla parishad (district council) Mosharaf Hossain said, “More than three lakh people returned home. Some came even from abroad. With the situation slowly normalising they have started returning to their place of work. Many of them have sought our help.”“Around 10,000 migrant labourers from this district have already left. Many of them took trains while some are hiring buses or private cars,” said Hossain.“Many of these labourers earn a good amount of money in other states. They were not getting similar jobs here. Many labourers have already returned in vehicles provided by their former employers,” added Hossain. “I think they came home because they were worried about their families. We have noticed that the queues outside ration shops are getting shorter every day. It means people have started earning,” Hossain said.Additional district magistrate (general) Siraj Dhaneswar said, “The district administration is trying to provide 100 days of employment to these people under MNREGA schemes. However, we cannot stop anyone from returning to their old place of work.”Political commentator and former principal of Presidency College (now university) Prof Amal Mukhopadhyay said, “These people went to other states because they were either unemployed or did not get proper wages. The fact that they are going back proves that the magnificent development chief minister Mamata Banerjee talks about is only cosmetic and not substantive. There has been no industrial growth during TMC rule. I am afraid West Bengal is the worst state as far as job opportunities are concerned.”Speaking to HT from Bolangir in Odisha, Rahaman Miyan, a migrant labourer from Suti, said, “I was working at a construction site here when the lockdown started. The company arranged a bus for us and we could return to our native village on April 16. We returned to the site in a bus the company provided.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-free-document-in-hand-bengal-migrants-back-to-jobs-in-other-states/story-mlYuwEcZ4QVkNlWpGLMGlN.html
11-06-2020||India||Third snow leopard death reported from Uttarakhand’s Gangotri National Park in past five years||The death of a snow leopard in Uttarakhand’s Gangotri National Park on Tuesday is the third fatality of the rare and protected animal in the past five years. The seven-year-old female snow leopard that died near the Nelong valley in the park on Tuesday was unwell and could have received injuries from a fall, said authorities.NB Sharma, deputy director of Gangotri National Park said, “Our staff found an unwell snow leopard ‘Dumkutiya’ while patrolling on Monday. A medical team and the divisional forest officer were informed on Tuesday, but by the time the team reached, the snow leopard had died. It seems it might have fallen off a cliff and was unwell due to that. We have sent its viscera sample for testing at Indian Veterinary Research Institute, Bareilly.”Sharma said, the first snow leopard death in the park was reported in the year 2015 from Nelong Valley and in 2018, the carcass of the second snow leopard was found from the same valley.Dehradun based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has estimated the current numbers of snow leopards using extrapolation based on habitat quality and snow leopard density. According to S Sathyakumar, senior scientist at WII, India likely has around 516 snow leopards--86 in Uttarakhand, 90 in Himachal Pradesh, 285 in Jammu and Kashmir, 13 in Sikkim, and 42 in Arunachal Pradesh.Also Read: Body of third wild elephant found in Chhattisgarh , officials suspect unnatural deathSnow leopard (Panthera uncia) is facing threats to its existence due to poaching and habitat destruction. It inhabits the Himalayas at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 metres. It is a Schedule I animal under the Wildlife Protection Act of India and is listed as ‘endangered’ by the International Union for Conservation of Nature.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesEarlier this year, a national protocol for snow leopard population assessment was undertaken by Dehradun based WII along with Karnataka-based Nature Conservation Foundation. The project is on the lines of the global project named ‘Population Assessment of World’s Snow leopards (PAWS)’ carried out by 12 countries where the highly rare animal is found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-snow-leopard-death-reported-from-uttarakhand-s-gangotri-national-park-in-past-five-years/story-Xtgdb9k17HOCJFnyzcupeI.html
11-06-2020||India||MSP for agri crops higher than global, market price; need to find viable solution: Nitin Gadkari||The government’s minimum support prices for agriculture crops are way higher then domestic market prices and international rates, Union minister Nitin Gadkari said on Thursday as he stressed on finding alternative solutions before an “economic crisis” is created. While the government fixes the rate, called minimum support price or MSP, at which it buys crops such as wheat and paddy from farmers, it also provides a subsidy to help export sugar. “The most important problem in this sector is that (among) the international price for agriculture commodities and the market price and the MSP, there is a vast difference. Now there are a lot of problems, some political problems are also there. It is very difficult for the government to take decisions. “But the ground reality is that our MSP is higher than the market price and international price. So this is now going to create a big economic crisis for the country. “We need to find out some options, alternatives for that, and without resolving that issue in agriculture, we cannot accelerate our economy because maximum purchasing power where we need to increase the potential in agriculture,” Gadkari said in a webinar. He said that the country has surplus rice and wheat and there is a problem of storage of these grains. Also, the government provided Rs 6,000 crore subsidy to export 60 lakh tonnes of sugar as the country is surplus in the sweetener, he said. The MSME and transport minister said: “In the agriculture area, there are some serious problems we are facing, we have surplus rice and wheat....we do not have a place for storage. It is totally full. We are surplus in rice and wheat for three years”. Gadkari also said that he has suggested for the formulation of a policy on converting rice into ethanol or bio-ethanol. He suggested this in a meeting with top officials, including principal advisor to Prime Minister P K Sinha and secretaries of food and civil supplies, agriculture, oil, non-conventional energy, and MSME, on Wednesday. “Presently our ethanol production is Rs 20,000 crore and imports are Rs 6-7 lakh crore. So now we are planning to make ethanol economy of Rs 1 lakh crore,” he said adding there are 200 closed sugar factories which can be converted for bio-ethanol production. He added that in states like Punjab, Haryana and some parts of Uttar Pradesh, there is a need to change the crop pattern and reduce the acreage of wheat and rice. “In Punjab and Haryana, we do not have a place for storage also...So this a bad situation for the country. On one side, we have surplus food grain and on other side, we do not have a place for storage,” Gadkari said. Further, he said that India imports a huge quantity of edible oil worth Rs 90,000 crore as India’s oilseed production is not up to the mark. He said that soybean production per acre in the US and Brazil is 30 quintals and 27-28 quintals respectively, but in India, it is just 4.5 quintal per acre. There is a need for research on quality oilseeds in the country for higher productivity, he added. Talking about PPE kits, which are in demand due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the minister said now its production in India has increased and is touching more than 5 lakh kit per day. “I have requested (Commerce and Industry Minister) Piyush Goyal ji that please give us permission to export PPE kits because we have got tremendous capacity now,” he said. Similarly, Gadkari said, India has significantly ramped up the production of sanitisers and are now getting good export orders. On developing waterways, he said a report has been submitted to the World Bank to make Delhi -Mathura-Agra-Itawah-Allahabad-Varanasi waterway and though this Delhi can be connected to the northeast and up to Myanmar and southeast Asia. Further, the minister called for decongesting metro cities like Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, and Kolkata and develop smart cities and villages. He added that India needs to attract foreign direct investment as investors are keen to invest here. “My target for two years is for making roads of Rs 15 lakh crore and we have just signed an agreement with a foreign bank for getting foreign credit for that ...480 projects already with me. M toll income is Rs 28000 crore per year. By the end of March, I am expecting Rs 40,000 crore and within five years, my toll income of NHAI will be Rs one lakh crore, he added. FDI can be allowed in NBFCs and “I feel that can be a good route. We need to go to RBI and finance to find out the way to give permission for that”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/msp-for-agri-crops-higher-than-global-market-price-need-to-find-viable-solution-nitin-gadkari/story-z1pTfPSvj5jwrXbSvQzc1H.html
11-06-2020||India||Nirav Modi remanded in custody till July 9 by UK court||Fugitive diamond merchant Nirav Modi, fighting extradition to India on charges over the nearly USD 2 billion Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud and money laundering case, was remanded in further custody until July 9 by a UK court on Thursday.The 49-year-old jeweller, who has been lodged at Wandsworth Prison in south-west London since his arrest in March last year, appeared via videolink for the remand hearing at Westminster Magistrates’ Court in London.He was remanded in further custody until July 9 as part of the regular 28-day “call-over” hearing.“The next hearing will be a similar videolink call-over towards the next stage of your extradition proceedings scheduled for September 7,” District Judge Samuel Goozee told Modi, who spoke only to confirm his name and nationality.Last month, Judge Goozee presided over the first part of the extradition trial, held in a partial remote setting due to the coronavirus lockdown restrictions, with the second part scheduled for a five-day hearing from September 7.“I hope Mr Modi by the time we get to September, the current restrictions on movement from prisons have been eased and you can be in court in person to follow the proceedings,” the judge had told Modi, at the end of a four-day partial hearing of the case on May 14.Modi had been following the court proceedings from a room at Wandsworth Prison and could be seen taking notes during the course of the trial.The first part of the case focused on establishing a prima facie case against him but the schedule had to be re-timetabled as the government of India submitted a further set of documents as “corroboratory evidence”. The judge allowed the additional evidence to be introduced but agreed that Modi’s defence team would require enough time to “digest” them.Therefore, a hearing already planned to deal with a second extradition request, made by the Indian authorities and certified by UK Home Secretary Priti Patel earlier this year on two additional charges of “causing the disappearance of evidence” and intimidating witnesses or “criminal intimidation to cause death”, has been effectively extended to conclude the prima facie case arguments.The judge has indicated that the two requests are “inextricably linked” and therefore he would be handing down an overall judgment at the conclusion of the second hearing, scheduled between September 7 and 11.The charges against the diamond merchant centre around his firms Diamonds R Us, Solar Exports and Stellar Diamonds making fraudulent use of a credit facility offered by the Punjab National Bank (PNB), known as “letters of undertaking” (LoUs). Modi’s team has sought to counter allegations of fraud by deposing witnesses to establish the volatility of the gems trade and that the LoUs were standard practice.The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), arguing on behalf of the Indian government, have been laying out the case that a number of PNB staff conspired with Modi to ensure LoUs were issued to his companies without ensuring they were subject to the required credit check, without recording the issuance of the LoUs and without charging the required commission upon the transactions. This resulted in a fraud amounting to nearly USD 2 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nirav-modi-remanded-in-custody-till-july-9-by-uk-court/story-zdFLxzyuu4Tb0o0nz4oPNN.html

This comes a week after Gandhi held a discussion with industrialist and Managing Director of Bajaj Auto Rajiv Bajaj on the economic fallout of Covid-19.Also read: ‘Need to make Covid-19 crisis major turning point for nation’ - PMTomorrow, Friday, 12th June, 10 AM onwards, join my conversation with Ambassador Nicholas Burns on how the Covid crisis is reshaping the world order, across all my social media platforms. pic.twitter.com/qIkWUbxxBgGandhi has been conduction a series of discussions with eminent personalities and experts amid the coronavirus crisis. His first dialogue was with former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan which took place on April 30. Rajan had told Gandhi that the second and the third lockdown in the country amid the Covid-19 crisis “will be devastating for India”.The subsequent weeks saw Gandhi hold discussions with Nobel laureate Abhijit Banerjee and globally renowned public health experts - Professor Ashish Jha of Harvard Global Health Institute and Swedish epidemiologist Johan Giesecke. While Banerjee recalled the need for a robust economic package for the revival of the coronavirus-hit economy, Rajiv Bajaj said that India has “flattened the wrong curve” by decimating India’s economy.  “You (the government) have not solved that problem. But you have definitely decimated the economy. You flattened the wrong curve. It is not the infection curve, it is the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) curve. This is what we have ended up with, the worst of both the worlds,” Bajaj told Gandhi last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-former-us-diplomat-nicholas-burns-to-discuss-impact-of-covid-19-crisis-tomorrow/story-3heZiJ9waoyZiTsFyah2mI.html
11-06-2020||India||PM Modi says ‘command and control’ regime over, let’s ‘plug and play’||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday reiterated his resolve to turn the Covid-19 crisis into an opportunity to make India self-reliant, and emphasised a policy shift from a “command and control” to a “plug and play” economy.Addressing the 95th annual plenary session of the Indian Chamber of Commerce in Kolkata over video conference, Modi asked the industry to focus on “people, planet and profit” to create globally competitive supply chains.Noting that the world is grappling with the Coronavirus crisis, he said: “But amid all these, every [Indian] citizen is also having a resolve to transform this disaster into an opportunity, to make this into a major turning point.”He defined this turning point as a “self-reliant India”. He said this has been the aspiration of Indians for several years, and it is being pursued through policies and actions for the past five to six years.“Now the Corona crisis has given us a task to accelerate this process and Atmnirbhar Bharat Abhiyan [self-reliant India initiative] is an outcome of that,” he said.Modi gave a call for an “Atmanirbhar Bharat” in his address to the nation on May 12, when he announced a package of more than Rs 20 lakh crore to revive the economy battered by the pandemic.According to the latest official data, the Indian economy grew 3.1% in the three months ended March 31. The growth rate in the full fiscal 2019-20 is expected to be 4.2%, the slowest in 11 years on the back of falling investment and consumption.Growth in the last quarter was sluggish despite only the last seven days of the period being impacted by the nationwide lockdown since March 25. A sharp fall in gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected due to the 68-day lockdown. Fitch Ratings on Wednesday forecast a 5% contraction in GDP this fiscal, but it expected growth to rebound to 9.5% next year.The next fiscal appears promising for India as S&P Global Ratings on Wednesday said the country’s economy is likely to achieve a strong 8.5% growth, following a 5% contraction in the current fiscal.These estimates came almost a week after Moody’s Investors Service downgraded India’s sovereign rating one notch to the lowest investment grade, with a negative outlook, saying the Indian economy would face a prolonged period of slower growth.S&P on Wednesday hoped recent structural reforms announced by the government, along with fiscal incentives in the Atmanirbhar Bharat package, would boost the economy. “While risks to India’s long-term growth rate are rising, ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country’s growth rate ahead of peers,” it said.Key structural reforms announced recently include expansion of the scope for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), allowing marketing freedom to farmers, liberalisation of commercial mining, a comprehensive disinvestment policy, and opening up the defence and space to private entrepreneurs. In September 2019, the government slashed corporate tax rates to make India a manufacturing destination, which, according to S&P, should reinforce growth alongside additional fiscal and monetary easing.In his address to the industry on Thursday, Modi said his government will take steps to reduce import dependency and encourage local manufacturing. He asked industry to focus on three factors – “people, planet and profit” – because all are interdependent.He gave the example of LED bulbs, once unaffordable to the common people. Five years ago, a LED bulb cost Rs 350. But it is now available for Rs 50. This helped provide relief to people, saved electricity worth Rs 19,000 crore and protected the environment, he said.“So, the planet has also benefited. And of course... manufacturers’ profits have increased,” he added.Modi urged businessmen to set up globally competitive domestic supply chains. “This is not the time for a conservative approach. It is time for bold decisions and bold investments,” he said.He said every citizen has resolved to face adversity with determination and this will be a “turning point” in the country’s history. “Atmanirbhar Bharat is the manifestation of the dream every Indian has seen for all these years,” he said.India can lead in manufacturing of products such as medical equipment, defence hardware, solar panels, batteries, chips and aviation, he said.On June 2, while addressing Indian businessmen, Modi had voiced confidence in the economy’s ability to return to rapid growth, listing it among his government’s top priorities and pledging his commitment to systematic reforms. “Yes! We will definitely get our growth back,” Modi said in his speech to a conference on “Getting Growth Back” organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-command-and-control-regime-over-let-s-plug-and-play/story-ke5OHEbbvJZt4WUC77GBJK.html

The organisation should perform its duty to the workers. Its action has left a lot to be desired,” said Sharma.Mani Kumar Darnal, president, National Union of Plantation Workers (NUPW), said, “The situation at the tea gardens in the Dooars is alarming. Even those workers living under institutional quarantine aren’t being tested properly.”AK Ray, deputy chairman, Tea Board of India, said, “We’ll assist the district administrations to prevent the spread of Covid-19. We’ll comply with the district administrations’ instructions.”John Barla, who represents the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) from Alipurduar Lok Sabha constituency, said: “North Bengal may surpass Maharashtra’s Covid-19 related death toll, if VRDL facilities are not set up in the region at the earliest, as the crisis has deepened because of the return of the migrant workers in large numbers.”There are 283 functional tea gardens spread across Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri and Alipurduar districts in north Bengal, which have around three lakh workers on its rolls and several thousand contractual workers are also hired during the peak plucking season every year.A large number of migrant workers, who left the tea gardens and went to other states in search of livelihood, have returned amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were imposed on March 25 to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak.North Bengal’s eight districts have reported 995 Covid-19 positive cases till Wednesday and 95% of them are migrant returnees.However, a month ago, the region had recorded only 34 Covid-19 positive cases and three districts were still in the green zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-spike-in-covid-19-cases-darjeeling-tea-planters-demand-test-labs-closer-to-gardens/story-02xy5SnrkQMJd74O0AAjzN.html

One of these flights landed at the Civil Enclave of Bamrauli Airport, Prayagraj, on Wednesday evening, with 151 migrant labourers of Prayagraj and neighbouring districts.Earlier, the plan was to send 1,547 registered labourers and their families by train but when the train was cancelled due to a technical issue, the cine star and the two trusts joined hands and sent these stranded labourers by air.Among those who landed along with their families and children at Bamrauli, there were many first-time fliers. “I am in the business of selling bangles and when my family had lost all hope of getting home, we were told that a flight would take us. My first reaction was that someone was joking but here I am, safe and secure along with my family, completing an experience that we will never forget,” said a passenger, belonging to Bhadohi, who did not wish to be named.The flight also brought migrant labourers from several other districts like Basti, Kaushambi, Bhadohi, Pratapgrah. Similar flights have been planned for cities like Varanasi, Lucknow, Gorakhpur and Patna also, they said.The noble act of the ‘Big B’ and the two religious trusts of Mumbai did not end there. From the airport, the migrants were dropped home by rented taxis, the cost of which was also incurred by the do-gooders.The passengers were permitted to leave the premises of the airport only after following all set norms.The help for the migrant labourers was named ‘Mission Milaap’ and the flights were sponsored by Amitabh Bachchan, under the guidance of Haji Ali Dargah trustee and Mahim Dargah managing trustee Suhail Khandwani. The activity was coordinated by Amitabh Bachchan Corporation Limited managing director Rajesh Yadav and Mahim Dargah IT director Sabir Syed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-b-trusts-charter-flights-to-get-1-500-migrants-home/story-DrOKVq7GBCVFXPdTblp2vL.html

There are no differences between the priest family and the TDB,” said state devaswom minister Kadakampally Surendran.The state minister said some people who were adamant on opening the shrine backtracked when the government decided to go ahead with it. The minister blamed cheap politics behind the confusion and the prolonged drama.Tantri Kandararu Mohanararu also played down differences over the issue, saying it was ideal not to allow devotees at this juncture. He cited the increase in the coronavirus cases in Kerala and the neighbouring states behind his decision.However, all daily poojas will be held at the shrine as per tantric customs. The temple was planning to open on June 14 and a week-long festival was to follow from June 19.Earlier, the tantri had sent a letter to the TDB commissioner and spoke to TDB chairman N Vasu about delaying the opening. The TDB, however, claimed that it did not receive any communication in this regard. The tantri is usually considered as the final word on all ritualistic matters.The TDB, a government-appointed body, runs Sabarimala and other major temples in south and central Kerala.“Many pilgrims swarm the temple from neighbouring states as well. It will be difficult to keep a tab on all devotees. So the festival and other functions can be postponed now,” the tantri said, adding allowing devotees at this juncture will pose a serious threat. His demand came in the wake of many Hindu organisations questioning the government’s decision to open shrines in the state.Unveiling the graded exit plan under ‘Unlock 1’, the central government had allowed reopening of places of worship for devotees, malls and restaurants from June 8 across the country. They have been shut since March 25, when the lockdown was first imposed to check the spread of the pandemic.The state has reported 2161 coronavirus cases with 19 deaths. At least 1238 people are undergoing treatment and more than 2 lakh people are under observation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-board-puts-freeze-on-temple-opening-kerala-calls-for-talks/story-4SoBsJJkhEFaS7hOCZkd3I.html
11-06-2020||India||Renewable energy, emergency and disaster management now among emerging sectors for jobs: Report||A new official report has proposed investments in the renewable energy sector to tide over the job and economic crisis associated with the Covid-19 pandemic.The Centre has announced a special economic package worth 10% of GDP. The Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), along with the National Institute of Public Policy and Finance (NIPFP), has submitted a report on how parts of this package could be used.Around 1.3 million full-time jobs can be created if India achieves 160 GW of solar and wind power by 2022. Further, the report proposes an amount of Rs 5,200 crore be invested during 2021-28 to create another 528,000 jobs and an economically viable market for a large share of the renewable energy. This could also greatly reduce coal imports.Beyond 2028, the funding required for the renewable sector is likely to be zero because of its competitiveness. Accelerated renewable energy deployment will save forex from reduced coal imports, the report said.“Even if half the generated renewable power is used to replace imported coal, India can save over Rs 6.75 lakh crore during 2021-2030 (nearly ten times the proposed outlay over the same period),” the report said. It also estimated India can save Rs 45,210 crore on oil imports each year by 2030 if 30% of cars sold in the country are electric vehicles.The emerging sectors with potential in the post-Covid-19 era will be distributed renewable energy, hybrid energy, emergency and disaster management systems, city gas distribution and urban transportation, according to the authors.For example, building a low-emission air conditioner servicing sector could create more than two million jobs by 2037.Scaling up investment in distributed renewable energy can create thousands of jobs. Around 110,000 skilled and unskilled jobs can be created by 20 GW of small-and large-scale micro-grids. About 50,000 potential skilled and unskilled jobs can be created for each 4 GW of rooftop solar power, the report estimated.NIPFP director Rathin Roy said: “The Covid-19 pandemic has presented some unique challenges. India must address structural issues of the economy and adopt a sustainable recovery path to emerge stronger. Our study with CEEW reflects on the need for key reforms and suggests policy, financial, technological and behavioural solutions to create an inclusive and more resilient economic system.”Responding to the report’s recommendations, energy economist Vibhuti Garg said, “In a post-Covid world, renewable energy makes more sense for a number of reasons. It is more competitive and cheaper than imported coal, it can create new industry for labour that have gone back to their states, and who can manufacture modules.“Decentralised solar energy can electrify hospitals in rural areas reliably. We have already seen such hospitals treating Covid-19 patients and it is not polluting like coal, so it reduces co-morbidities associated with pollution.”The report recommended a share of capital be used for disaster preparedness by developing a “Climate Risk Atlas”, an emergency surveillance system and a response network. Such an atlas will require Rs 5 crore for basic operation and maintenance expenses.The atlas can cover coasts, urban heat stress, water stress, crop loss, vector-borne diseases, and biodiversity collapse.The UN’s Inter-Agency Standing Committee’s (UN-IASC) report on return on investment in emergency preparedness states that every Rs 75.35 invested for preparedness saves more than Rs 150.70 in future responses. India has spent nearly Rs 13.52 lakh crore on disaster management in the past 20 years, and the government could have saved close to Rs 6.76 lakh crore if such systems were in place, the report estimated.Another recommendation, on learning from the Covid-19 crisis, is to deploy large-scale state-supported canteens to provide hygienic, affordable and nutritious food thrice a day to urban migrant workers (approximately 30 million). This would require a capital investment of Rs 26,500 crore for 60,000 canteens and 8,200 kitchens.Globally, there is a push for using Covid-19 economic stimulus packages for strengthening environmental regulations. The Intergovernmental Science Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services’ experts believe governments should deploy stimulus packages that offer incentives for sustainable and nature-positive activities, and they should adopt a “One Health” approach at all levels, recognising the complex interconnections among the health of people, animals and plants and mobilising international finance to build health capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/renewable-energy-emergency-and-disaster-management-now-among-emerging-sectors-for-jobs-report/story-m3dCfGGZI7VuZbWsuUxJ2L.html

If you want, you capture the global market with such products,” said PM Modi.Sikkim became the first state in India to officially announce the adoption of organic farming in the year 2003 to ensure long term sustenance.He also said that the ongoing initiative to get rid of single-use-plastic could prove beneficial for West Bengal because it can give a boost to the jute industry.Also read: ‘Need to make Covid-19 crisis major turning point for nation’ - PM Modi“Think about the profit West Bengal can make when every individual carries a jute bag made in West Bengal. Have you taken advantage of the initiative to get rid of single-use plastic? Have you started making packaging material with jute instead of plastic? You should take advantage of this. Who would help you if you don’t grab this opportunity?” he asked the chamber authorities, adding that the manufacturing sector in Bengal needs to be revived. Bengal is tagged as the jute hub of India with around 60-odd jute mills in the state. During the Covid-19 lockdown, when mills had to be closed down, union textiles minister Smriti Irani had called up Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee requesting her to allow these mills to resume work. Banerjee had also received calls from chief ministers of Maharashtra and Telangana with requests to allow jute mills to resume work because the harvest season was nearing and the Food Corporation of India was looking up to Bengal for jute sacks.The prime minister said that India should convert the Covid-19 crisis into a turning point towards becoming a self-reliant nation. “Time has come to bring out the Indian economy from ‘command and control’ and move towards ‘plug and play’. This is not the time for a conservative approach. This is the time for bold decisions and bold investments,” he said.Citing the example of the UJALA scheme, launched in January 2015, PM Modi stressed how ‘People, Planet and Profit’ can co-exist and flourish.Also read: ‘No time for conservative approach’ - PM Modi calls for bold decisions to spur economy“With LED lights we are saving Rs 19,000 crore every year. The emission of Carbon Dioxide has been reduced by around 4 crore tons,” said Modi. He also said that the International Solar Alliance is becoming a big movement across the globe and efforts are being made to take full advantage of this. He urged the ICC to handhold various agencies and MSMEs working on this.The prime minister started his address in Bengali saying, “Nomoshkar. Asha kori apnara sabai bhalo achen. (Namaskar. Hope you are all well)”. He often referred to Rabindranath Tagore and Swami Vivekananda during his speech while stressing the need for India to become a self-reliant nation.Prime minister’s comments came while he was addressing the 95th annual plenary session of the Indian Chamber of Commerce via video conferencing on Thursday. The ICC is one of the top bodies representing businesses and industries in the eastern and north-eastern India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-east-can-become-organic-hub-of-india-have-global-identity-pm-modi/story-dmdajyLh5LEu4c81OPMCpK.html

Islamabad has been offering scholarships targeted at Kashmiri students for years but these were mostly on a much smaller scale.Kashmir police estimates about 150 Kashmiris are enrolled in medical and engineering courses in Pakistan and occupied territories.Police officers said the applicants mostly need a recommendation from separatist groups such as the Hurriyat or terror group Hizbul Mujahideen chief Syed Salahuddin-led United Jihad Council based in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir’s Muzaffarabad.Like the one that was recovered from the residence of Hurriyat leader Nayeem Khan. In one document seized by the National Investigation Agency, according to a report on its 2018 charge sheet, Nayeem Khan recommends admission for a student in “a standard medical college” because “her family has remained committed to the freedom struggle through thick and thin”.The NIA, which was investigating a terror funding case, had then underlined that many of the students proceeding to Pakistan on student visas “were either relatives of ex-militants or relatives of families of active militants who had indulged in various anti-national activities and had migrated to Pakistan or they were known to Hurriyat leaders”.A senior security official in Delhi said Kashmiri students who rushed to take up scholarships in PoK colleges would suffer the most because the degrees they picked up weren’t recognised in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/security-agencies-red-flag-imran-khan-s-1-600-scholarship-plan-for-kashmiris/story-3vdJugg1JIRTOCqnaWh0pM.html

The construction of 73 houses for priests of the shrine, to be developed in five blocks, two of which have been already completed, will be completed in September this yearIn October 2017, PM Narendra Modi had laid the foundation stones of five major reconstruction projects at the Kedarnath shrine. The reconstruction projects for which he laid the foundation stone included improved facilities for devotees, construction of retaining walls and ghats at the Mandakini and Saraswati rivers, an approach road to the shrine and reconstructing the Samadhi Sthal of Adi Shankaracharya, an early eighth-century seer and the founder of the Vedanta school of philosophy.PM Modi had visited Rudra meditation cave in Kedarnath in May last year. He had spent a day meditating at the cave, which is nearly a kilometre from the Kedarnath shrine.

He had also visited the Badrinath shrine in May last year.Kedarnath and Badrinath, along with Yamunotri and Gangotri, collectively called Char Dham, are one of the most revered pilgrimages in the Hindu tradition and attract lakhs of pilgrims each year. Kedarnath shrine is located near the Mandakini river in Rudraprayag district. According to tradition, the shrine was built by Pandavas and revived by Adi Sankaracharya. The shrine was the worst affected area during the 2013 flash floods, with Kedarnath town suffering extensive damage. Badrinath is located along the banks of the Alaknanda River in Chamoli district at a height of over 10,000 feet. This year on April 29, when the portals of the Kedarnath shrine were opened, the first prayers were offered on behalf of PM Modi to help the country fight the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/focus-on-spiritual-legacy-pm-modi-in-review-of-kedarnath-reconstruction-work/story-Naz2LGxtHpzEbHIInCL3ZI.html

Localities like Tagore Town, Allahpur, Sohbatiyabagh, George Town, Kareli, Civil Lines reported locust swarms covering the sky and creating panic among the locals.The people resorted to clanging of utensils and tin cans to bursting firecrackers in a bid to chase them away.Earlier, these short-horned grasshoppers had attacked trans-Yamuna villages of Koraon, Meja, Phulpur, Karchana in the Prayagraj district between Tuesday evening and Wednesday. Local administrative officials of these development blocks, along with villagers, had effectively repulsed the attack of these creatures with the help of chemicals, sprayed using fire tenders and tractors. They also played loud music along with creating smoke in the fields.Earlier this morning, these swarms were first spotted in two areas of the city: Sangam and over the old city areas. “I was standing on my terrace when I suddenly saw huge locust swarms flying in the air. Locusts measuring up to two inches and even more were everywhere,” said Geeta Mishra, a resident of Rajroopur.The Chandra Shekhar Azad Park, spread over 133 acres in the middle of the city with lush green trees, was also swamped by them.Superintendent of Chandra Shekhar Azad Park Seema Singh Rana said that locusts were all over the garden at around 10am. The staff, the officer added, beat up cans and plates deterring locusts from descending up on the trees. “We got away with mere 10% damage to trees and plants,” she added.Chief Fire Safety Officer RS Mishra said, “We have yet not received any written or oral instructions from the district administration to press our fire tenders into service for spraying of chemicals in the city limits. The moment our help is required, we will send the fire tenders.” Chief Development Officer (CDO), Ashish Kumar said, “This is the dispersed swarms of locusts which is moving towards Kaushambi after our action against them in Bahadurpur and other areas of Meja, Karchana and Koraon development block on the Wednesday night.”As it is day time, they will not settle down but still locals and civic administration have been asked to burst firecrackers and make a lot of sound so that they keep on moving, he said.The official further added that the district administration of Kaushambi, along with the state and central monitoring agencies, has been informed about the latest development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/locust-swarms-in-uttar-pradesh-s-sangam-heading-towards-kaushambi/story-BDwdC7z4nx0BPxJ6q6mYeL.html

The study has also called for the need to enhance human, tick and livestock surveillance in other districts of Rajasthan and nearby states.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageFour human samples and thirteen Hyalomma tick pools were found positive for CCHFV positive and two different types of glycoprotein precursor (M) segments were observed in the tick samples, according to the study that was conducted by researchers at the National Institute of Virology; Indian Council of Medical Research, Department of Health Research (ICMR); National Centre of Disease Control; Sawai Man Singh Medical College-Jaipur; All India Institute of Medical Sciences-Jodhpur; State Disease Diagnostic Centre; Animal Husbandry-Jaipur and Dr SN Medical College-Jodhpur. The study was published in the journal Virus Research on June 4.“CCHF is a zoonotic viral disease presenting with fever and hemorrhagic manifestations in humans. After several outbreaks of CCHF being reported from Gujarat since 2011 till 2019, and from Rajasthan in 2014 and 2015, the present study reports the CCHF outbreak which was recorded from five human cases in three districts Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, and Sirohi of Rajasthan state since August 2019 till November 2019,” the study read. According to the findings, a high percent of positivity was recorded in the samples of livestock animals for the CCHFV IgG antibody. Human blood samples that were found positive for the CCHF virus (CCHFV) and Hyalomma tick pool samples were sequenced using next-generation sequencing method. Two different M segment genotypes, encoding glycoprotein precursor, were identified from tick pools in the study - first from Asian and second from African lineage. The L gene (polymerase) and the S gene (nucleocapsid) clustered in the Asian lineage.“We also observed 6% amino acid changes between the death and the survived case of CCHFV in the M gene. This report also sets an alarm to enhance human, tick and livestock surveillance in other districts of Rajasthan and nearby states. Biosafety measures, barrier nursing along with the availability of personal protective equipment and ribavirin drug will always be a mainstay in preventing nosocomial infection for proper case management,” experts suggested.The study said that, “though no nosocomial or human-to-human transmission of CCHF or any infection amongst close contacts was reported in the outbreak of 2019, still it alarms the intense awareness campaigns and trainings amongst healthcare workers, animal handlers, and abattoir workers/farmers, veterinarians which will help in early reporting and quick diagnosis as well as reducing the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-lineages-of-congo-fever-viruses-present-in-rajasthan-study/story-7tbbJrfn9LMMKyXt167tQI.html

Scientists believe this will help patients who are under home quarantine.Famotidine is often given to people who experience indigestion. It is taken in doses of 20-160 mg, up to four times a day, for the treatment of acid reflux and heartburn.For the findings, the scientists from Cold Spring Harbour Laboratory Cancer Centre in the US picked 10 people (six men; four women) who developed Covid-19 infection.The severity of five cardinal symptoms - cough; shortness of breath; fatigue; headache and loss of taste/smell as well as general unwellness - was measured using a version of a 4-point scale normally applied to assess the severity of cancer symptoms (ECOG PS).All started taking famotidine when they were feeling very poorly with Covid-19. The most frequently used dose was 80 mg taken three times a day, with the average treatment period lasting 11 days.The findings showed that all 10 patients said that symptoms quickly improved within 24-48 hours of starting famotidine and had mostly cleared up after 14 days. Scientists said that the medicine reduced the level of acid in stomach.However, they say the medicine helps Covid-19 patients, more work is needed to take a closer look at the clinical relevance of famotidine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indigestion-drug-may-help-treat-covid-19-symptoms-say-researchers/story-daFzgAhMCuMpg6j5jz03SM.html

11-06-2020||India||Difference with UK narrows as India records big jump in Covid-19 cases, 357 deaths in 24 hours||India came a step closer to the Covid-19 tally of fourth worst-affected country, the UK, on Thursday after the total number of cases reached 2,86,579. The UK has 2.9 lakh Covid-19 cases, according to Johns Hopkins University.According to the Union health ministry update at 8 am, the country recorded 9,996 cases in the last 24 hours. The number of fatalities reached 8,102 (357 deaths in the last 24 hours), while 1,41,028 patients have been cured or discharged.The country has been recording close to 10,000 cases for the last 10 days, and it has added nearly 90,000 or nearly one-third cases of the total tally.India’s first Covid-19 case was detected more than four months ago on January 30, but it took more than 100 days thereafter to reach the one lakh-mark on May 18. However, the next one lakh cases were added in just about a fortnight and the tally can hit three lakh-mark this week itself at the current rate.India reached an important milestone on Wednesday when the total number of recovered patients crossed the number of active cases. According to Hindustan Times’ Covid-19 dashboard, the difference between these two numbers on Tuesday was 1,375. On Thursday, the gap further widened to 3,580. There are 1,37,448 active cases, according to the health ministry.In the last week, an average of 4,529 new active cases have been added to the national tally every day, while 5,397 patients have recovered daily. If these trajectories continue, this gap is likely to widen in the coming days.One of key factors for the number of recoveries catching up to active cases has been India’s low case fatality rate (CFR). Since 2.8% of infected people have died so far, the number of active cases (calculated by subtracting the number of recovered patients and deaths from the total tally) has been steadily dropping, particularly from the end of May.The development also came on the same day that the total number of tests conducted in the country crossed the 5 million-mark, according to the ICMR. As of Tuesday, India tested 5,061,332 samples. This means that India has conducted 3,797 tests for every million residents - the lowest among the 10 worst-hit countries in the world. Italy, which has over 50,000 fewer cases than India, has conducted over 71,000 tests per million of its population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/difference-with-uk-narrows-as-india-records-another-big-jump-in-covid-19-cases-357-deaths-in-24-hours/story-ndwNURQNoIJG68VGaLyxGM.html

Joshi said strict legal action should be taken against such identified elements who are trying to lure public representatives. However, he did not specify who is making the attempts.Meanwhile, the MLAs who were summoned by chief minister Ashok Gehlot at his residence for a discussion, ahead of June 19 Rajya Sabha elections in the state, were taken to a luxury resort located at the Delhi highway on Wednesday.The chief minister also reached there for the discussion and stayed till late night.Sources claimed that the Congress has decided to keep party MLAs and independents at the hotel till the elections.The biennial elections for the three Rajya Sabha seats from Rajasthan are scheduled on June 19.Congress has nominated KC Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi as its candidates while the BJP had nominated Rajendra Gehlot and Onkar Singh Lakhawat. In the house of 200, Congress has 107 MLAs - including six of those who defected to Congress from the BSP last year. The party has the support of 13 independent MLAs. The BJP has 72 MLAs and the support of three Rashtriya Loktantrik Party MLAs.AICC spokesperson and in-charge of RS polls, Randeep Surjewala said Congress has an absolute majority.Addressing media outside the airport he said, “The people of the heroic land of Rajasthan are brave and fearless as well...

The post-mortem report of both the tuskers is awaited.“Both the bodies were found in separate places of Pratapur forest range of the district. The post-mortem of pregnant elephant is going on and the report is awaited while the forest officials could not reach the body of another elephant, which died on Wednesday, because the herd is still surrounding the body,” Additional Principal Chief Conservator of Forest (Wildlife) Arun Kumar Pandey who visited the spot told Hindustan Times.“It seems that the pregnant elephant died due to cardiovascular failure and some cysts were also found in her body. However, the exact cause of death will come out after the post-mortem report which will we get on Thursday. A team of doctors are working on the report,” said Pandey.He further said that on Wednesday, the officials tried to reach the body of second elephant but the efforts went in vain because it was surrounded by the herd.“Once the herd will move away, its postmortem will be conducted and the cause of the death will be known,” said Pandey added.Forest officials believe the dead jumbos belonged to the herd of elephants roaming in the area since last one month.Notably, North Chhattisgarh is home to around 240 wild elephants, which roam in the coal rich forest lands in Surguja region of the state. Several reports of human-elephant conflicts surfaced in last few years in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-elephants-found-dead-in-chhatttisgarh-in-last-two-days/story-3Xt3AFWrxVbnEMoo90jTSO.html

But then this should not make them complacent and people should follow social distancing and sanitization guidelines,” Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor in the Department of Pulmonary, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine at the Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi, told news agency PTI.Dr Gupta also said that 80 per cent are likely to have mild disease and make 100 per cent recovery.The number of active cases in the country stands at 1,33,632, while 1,35,205 people have recovered and one patient has migrated, according to the Union health ministry..“Thus, 48.9 per cent of the patients have recovered so far,” an official said.In the last week, an average of 4,529 new active cases have been added to the national tally every day, while 5,397 patients have recovered daily. If these trajectories continue, this gap is likely to widen in the coming days.One of key factors for the number of recoveries catching up to active cases has been India’s low case fatality rate (CFR). Since 2.8 per cent of infected people have died so far, the number of active cases (calculated by subtracting the number of recovered patients and deaths from the total tally) has been steadily dropping, particularly from the end of May.Active cases outnumbered the total recovered patients throughout the outbreak until Tuesday - the gap peaking on May 11, when active cases had a 23,511-case lead - according to Hindustan Times’ Covid-19 dashboard.Recoveries soon picked up pace as patients, particularly the 155,668 new cases reported through May, started getting discharged. On May 29, India reported 11,707 new recoveries (highest in a single day so far), helped by Maharashtra that discharged 8,381 asymptomatic patients in one day.Meanwhile, India reported 9,985 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday as the total count of cases crossed over 2.76 lakh with 279 deaths reported in the last 24 hours.The surge in cases over the last few days has prompted the Union health ministry to send central teams to assist state health officials in reviewing the public health measures being undertaken to combat Covid-19 in six cities of Delhi, Mumbai, Ahmedabad, Chennai, Kolkata and Bengaluru which are among the major contributors to India’s rising tally of coronavirus infections.These teams will provide technical support and handhold the state health departments and municipal health officials for reviewing public health measures implemented for containment and management of COVID-19 outbreak in the six cities, the Union health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hope-for-people-say-experts-as-india-s-recovery-count-exceeds-active-infections/story-FwKhM5Fdfo0Xk9anExSVoJ.html
11-06-2020||India||29% rise in Asiatic lion numbers, says Gujarat||The Gujarat forest department has suggested that the Asiatic Lion population in Gir national park has increased by 29% in the past five years — from 523 in 2015 to 674 in 2020. The department has also said the distribution area of lions in the Saurashtra region of Gujarat, where Gir is situated, has increased by 36% from 22,000 sqkm in 2015 to 30,000 sqkm.“Over the last several years, the Lion population in Gujarat has been steadily rising. This is powered by community participation, emphasis on technology, wildlife healthcare, proper habitat management and steps to minimise human-lion conflict. Hope this positive trend continues!,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi tweeted.Shyamlal Tikadar, Gujarat’s chief wildlife warden and principal chief conservator of forests, said the Asiatic lion, which once faced the threat of extinction, has shown extraordinary recovery , thanks to the timely intervention by the erstwhile Nawab of Junagadh and protection programmes of the Gujarat government.“Today, Asiatic lions are present in protected areas and agro-pastoral landscape of Saurashtra covering nine districts in a sprawling expanse of over 30,000 sq. km, which is termed as the Asiatic Lion landscape],” Tikadar said. He said the 15th Asiatic Lion Population Estimation based on scat analysis and camera trap modelling was scheduled to take place on June 5-6, but that did not happen due to the coronavirus disease situation.“...the forest department conducted an exercise in which 1,400 forest guards of 13 divisions were asked to spot lions and report their presence. Based on their reports, we estimated the population. The exercise was called Poonam Avlokan (because it was conducted on full moon night),” he said.In 2015, Gir recorded 523 lions, an increase of 27% since 2010. “That estimation was a scientific one and was based on established methodology for estimating cat population,” said Anish Andheria, the president of Mumbai based Wildlife Conservation Trust. He did not comment on the methodology adopted this time, saying he did not study it.“Poonam Avlokan is a routine monitoring exercise done by forest department. During a pandemic, the effort to monitor lion numbers is commendable. This tells us their number has increased. We need to now understand on how other conservation challenges of Asiatic Lions will be addressed,” said Meena Venkataraman, a scientist specialising in Asiatic Lions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/29-rise-in-asiatic-lion-numbers-says-gujarat/story-b6BPKWSGtuqqZmnqGr4EpM.html
11-06-2020||India||Goa activists allege scam in scheme meant for construction workers, demand probe||Activists in Goa have alleged a scam in the registration of beneficiaries under the Goa Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Scheme, and demanded an inquiry into how people who are clearly not construction labourers have registered their names to receive benefits under the scheme. According to a complaint filed before the Panaji Police as well as before the Commissioner of Labour and Employment, a group of seven activists has alleged that at least a few of the around 15,000-odd beneficiaries who received funds under the scheme, were in fact people associated with political parties. They said that these people are elected representatives at the village level and have businesses not connected with construction labour.“Among these there are many panches and sarpanches who have registered. For now we have one name of one Mohini Tari who was a former sarpanch. We have heard that there are others as well who are candidates of political parties at the district panchayat elections,” Kashinath Shetye, who filed the complaint along with six others, told mediapersons.The money under the scheme is meant for labourers affected by the Covid-19 lockdown.Tari approached the labour commissioner to return the money claiming that it was wrongfully credited to her. But activists claim that about a dozen other people have been identified as being wrongful recepients of the money meant for labourers.The police are yet to register an FIR in connection with the case.There are around 15,491 labourers registered under the Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Fund that is maintained by the Goa Labour Welfare Board. A total of Rs 5.63 crore was released to the beneficiaries back in March this year as a one time grant under the scheme that was meant to help construction workers tide over the lockdown. Each beneficiary under the scheme was granted Rs 6,000. “We are demanding that this be checked and the money should be returned. And it shouldn’t end there because they have falsified affidavits claiming that they are laborers. There should be action against them. I don’t know how they are registered,” Shetye alleged. Under the scheme beneficiaries have to submit a certificate by a labour contractor stating that they have spent at least 90 days in a year working at a construction site in order to continue to receive benefits under the scheme. The activists claim that they do not know the total number of bogus beneficiaries registered under the scheme but said that an inquiry into the matter would reveal the true extent of the scam. Chief Minister Pramod Sawant, when asked to comment on the alleged bogus beneficiaries, said that the matter needed to be probed at the level of the Labour Commissioner. “Let him look into it. Why should I say anything. These beneficiaries have been added over the last many years,” Sawant said. What piqued the interest of the activists was when, back in April, Sawant read out a list of beneficiaries of the scheme to make a point that most of them were Goan. Sawant was facing criticism that the Goa government was going out of its way to help migrant labourers while neglecting locals affected by the pandemic. Realising the distress in the construction labour sector, the central government had issued directives to all states to release funds for Building and Construction cess for beneficiaries under the Building and Other Construction Workers (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Act, 1996.Accordingly, each registered worker received Rs 6,000 in their bank accounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-activists-allege-scam-in-scheme-meant-for-construction-workers-demand-probe/story-vV2j89EQSAsT91YucbRDNK.html

According to the official, the operation to count the counterfeit notes is still underway. ​“After detailed planning with the MI team, a joint operation was carried out today (Wednesday) in which six persons including one serving military person has been detained with multiple denominations of fake Indian and foreign currency. Counting of currency is going on as per the procedure,” read a statement by Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Crime, Pune. ​The arrested six men have been identified as Indian Army jawan Shaikh Alim Gulab Khan, and civilians Sunil Badrinarayan Sarda, Ritesh Ratnakar, Tufail Ahmed Mohammad Ishaq Khan, Abdul Gani Rehmtullah Khan, Abdul Rehman Abdul Gani Khan, according to the police.​“After counting, Indian currency of various denominations worth Rs 43.4 crore and US dollars worth Rs 4.2 crore has been seized. The quality of the notes will be checked in due course by experts. Many of the notes are marked ‘Children Bank of India’,” read a police statement. ​The information about the fake currency operation was provided by officials of military intelligence, according to the police. The fake currency notes were in different denominations, including Rs 1,000, which has been demonetised by the central government in 2016.“Some of these currency notes carried the stamp of ‘Children Bank of India’ and may have been printed before 2016 when the government made the denominations of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 invalid,” said a defence official aware of the developments on the condition of anonymity.“The amount (Rs 43.4 crore and Rs 4.2 crore) is excluding the worth of Rs 1,000 notes seized. In most of the notes, instead of Reserve Bank of India, it says ‘Children’s Bank of India’. The purpose seems to be cheating. In the bundle of US dollars, the first note is genuine, the rest are counterfeit. These six men had been working together. The person whom they had offered the fake currency, had informed us,” said Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of police, Pune.​A statement released earlier on Wednesday evening by the defence spokesperson, stated, “Southern Command Intelligence wing along with crime branch Pune carried out a successful joint operation in Vimannagar and busted a fake currency racket on June 10. Six people, including five civilians and a soldier, were apprehended with fake Indian and foreign currency to the tune of approximately Rs 10 crore. At least Rs2 lakh in Indian currency, US dollars equivalent and one fake pistol was recovered during the operation. Individuals have been handed over to the crime branch Pune for interrogation and further investigation is under progress.”​According to Singh, there were two parties involved. “One party was seeking American dollars while the other party had a supply of Indian (counterfeit) currency. They decided and met at the spot from where they were intercepted,” said Singh.​The source of the currency is part of the investigation, said police officials. ​Officials of Unit 4 of the Pune police crime branch along with the Anti-Narcotic Cell (West) worked with inputs provided by officials of Military Intelligence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-official-five-others-arrested-in-fake-currency-raid-in-pune/story-VWxVsjt21S9LUOaOTFyEPM.html

11-06-2020||India||Covid-19 pandemic set to reshape nature of work||Two weeks before Tamil Nadu imposed prohibitory orders in Chennai and other parts of the state to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on March 24, Suresh Sambandam asked his 200 employees to stop working from their 15,000-sq ft open office—complete with a pool table, a café bar and desks surrounded by swings for seats—in Chennai’s information technology hub.By March 25, when the national Covid-19 lockdown was enforced, nearly half employees of Kissflow Inc, the SaaS (software as a service) company Sambandam founded in 2003 (then called OrangeScape Technologies), were working from their hometowns across Tamil Nadu. The rules have been relaxed for private companies to function, but Sambandam is not in a hurry to return to the way things were.At a virtual town hall meeting with his employees on June 5, Sambandam unveiled what he called the Remote+ model of work that he intended to institute permanently. In a nutshell, teams would stagger their schedule of working from office while the rest of the time they would work remotely. Employees would be encouraged to work from their hometowns. Asking employees kitted up to work remotely to live in non-urban centres would help the local economy, Sambandam reasoned. The company would reimburse 80% of the expense if an employee needs to buy an ergonomic chair, desk, and battery-operated internet dongle. For those, who would come to Chennai for the mandatory week every monthin office, the company would provide accommodation.The Sars-CoV-2 virus, which causes Covid-19, has forced companies to rethink the way they work as well as where they work. More people than ever are using online tools to meet and collaborate on the internet.Zoom, a video-conferencing application that offers a freemium model (some free and some paid features) is so ubiquitous, that it is now used as a verb. Zoom Video Communications, the American firm that has developed the application, has posted a profit of $27 million between February and April. In comparison, last year, its profit was $198,000. In May, Google Meet, another video-conferencing application, crossed 50 million downloads in the Google Play store.Larger companies are also beginning to see the benefits of working remotely. India’s largest software services company, Tata Consultancy Services, has announced that up to 75% of its global workforce will work from home by 2025.It isn’t different elsewhere.Tobias Lutke, the founder of Canadian multinational e-commerce company Shopify, announced over Twitter that the office of the Ottawa-based firm would remain closed till 2021 and remote work will become permanent for most employees. “We’ve always had some people remote, but they used the internet as a bridge to the office. This will reverse now. The future of the office is to act as an on-ramp to the same digital workplace that you can access from your #WFH setup,” he wrote.The company has offices spread out across time zones, from Shenzhen in China to Sydney (Australia), Bengaluru, and Vilnius (Lithuania).Working from home requires infrastructure: good mobile connectivity, fast-speed internet, but importantly, a comfortable chair. Indian furniture maker Godrej Interio has a four-person team, called the Ergonomics and Workspace Research Cell, whose mandate is to study issues commonly faced in offices — like noisy colleagues — and publish findings that eventually guide their product design team.During the lockdown, it began to study the challenges of working from home. “The research revealed that people were working from the sofa, dining table, and bed; all of this was not designed for long hours of laptop work. We saw a 140% spike on searches done for chairs on our website. The second item in demand was a worktable,” said Sameer Joshi, an associate vice-president in the marketing division of Godrej Interio, who leads the team.Based on their findings, the company has launched a range of home office furniture, including workstations, work tables, work desks, and chairs among others.For technology companies that operate on digital platforms, the shift to remote work has been seamless. Sambandam’s employees use Kissflow, a cloud-based digital workplace software platform created by his company (Kiss stands for Keep it Simple, Stupid, a well-known design principle). Virtual meet-ups have replaced Friday evening gatherings at the office. A certified yoga instructor conducts sessions each morning over video; employees discuss books and create podcasts to deal with the stress of lockdown.But not all professions can make this switch easily.Swaty Singh Malik, a Delhi-based matrimonial lawyer, said the new system of e-filing cases and appearing before a judge in a video call is nothing like the thronging crowds in the courtroom that lawyers are used to. “Ours is the art of persuasion standing before a judge, not just a submission of documents,” Malik said, adding that many of her cases and mediations are pending. “Only urgent matters are taken up for hearing, and that means that your case may not come up at all,” she said. “No matter how much advice you give on the phone, it cannot really be implemented or enforced until the court steps in.”Courtrooms, which are always filled with people, will need to enforce physical distancing whenever they open. So will open-plan offices. The open office, which was pioneered in the 1950s, was meant to be a breakthrough in workflow and efficiency. But it has often been criticised for doing the opposite: causing greater distraction and reduced productivity, according to some workplace surveys. What is more, the open office is highly susceptible to spreading infection, and companies are beginning to take note of that.At an online panel discussion hosted by San Mateo-headquartered software company Freshworks on May 20, its founder and chief executive officer Girish Mathrubootham said that the company is “workplace-ready” for whenever its offices — located in Chennai, Berlin, and California—open. This includes a sanitisation protocol, thermal screening equipment, newly arranged seating to enable effective social distancing and limit face to face meetings. Even their café vendor has developed a mobile app that would alert employees when their food is ready for pick up, he said. The company has also created a vulnerability profile of its employees to decide whether it is better for them to stay home, Mathrubootham said.“For the first time, many organisations will have to think of their employees being in a kind of life and death situation [inside the office]. In most industries, you do not think about this, unless you are in the manufacturing space or in the armed forces. So, if you view it from that perspective, then certain investments have to be made,” said Aparna Piramal Raje, an author and columnist.Global commercial real estate services firm Cushman & Wakefield is testing a design concept called the Six Feet Office to help employees stay six feet apart. This includes signage that will help people recognise distance, usage of disposable desk covers, and ensuring that people walk only clockwise through the office space to minimise the chances of people bumping into each other.Joshi of Godrej Interio said that at least 75 companies have approached his team to help them redesign office interiors keeping the Covid-19 disease in mind.“Today’s offices are designed to bring people closer, foster collaboration, teamwork and increase speed of response. They are not designed to separate people and thereby prevent the spread of the disease. Godrej Interio, therefore, strongly believes that existing offices need a rethink. We are offering retrofit solutions for existing offices and are recommending flexible design solutions for new offices. We need to keep in mind that the pandemic will be around for 18-24 months while offices have to last much longer than that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-pandemic-set-to-reshape-nature-of-work/story-h5fx3c5WA90xgIcT5rrgAP.html
11-06-2020||India||Chinese air activity goes down, limited troop pullback effected||Indian and Chinese air force fighters remained on the ground, with negligible air activity noticed over the past two days, even as disengagement of troops picked up at two out of four points in the eastern Ladakh sector, officials watching the situation said on Wednesday. The PLA Air Force fighter activity has come down considerably since military commander talks on June 6. Fighter air activity was nil on Tuesday while there was some air movement in Aksai Chin region on Wednesday, said the officials cited above, adding that there was significant reduction of Chinese vehicles at patrolling point 14 at Galwan Nullah and a decrease in PLA troops at the contentious finger 4 in the Pangong Tso sector. The PLA has already moved out 15 high-speed interceptor boats from the finger 4 area of the high-altitude lake.According to senior officials, the reduction of air activity and the withdrawal from the two most contested points in eastern Ladakh means that disengagement will pick up in the coming days, with military commanders on both sides in touch with each other. While the annual summer military exercises are on in China’s Xinjiang region, the air forces on both sides conducted combat air patrol sorties around the stand-off area with air defences ready across the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Both the Indian Air Force (IAF) and PLAAF (People’s Liberation Army Air Force) had been flying their platforms since the stand-off between the two countries’ armies began a month ago in the Galwan and Pangong Tso areas of eastern Ladakh.The PLAAF brought in additional strength of half-a-squadron of fighters to the western Xinjiang region in the name of military exercises and had not only activated its air defences but also all the air bases—Kashgar, Hotan, Yarkand, Korla, Ngari-Gunsa—in the region. The Ministry of External Affairs remains tight-lipped about the ground situation in eastern Ladakh, but it is understood that the disengagement will be done slowly and steadily by the two armies with the military commanders being in touch with each other.Even though the Chinese PLAAF has undertaken a number of sorties in the vicinity of eastern Ladakh like the Indian Air Force, senior Indian military commanders believe that this fighter flying was on account of exercises. “As we have no confirmation that the fighters were loaded with ammunition and missiles, we believe that the Chinese Air Force was participating in military exercises. Weaponising the aerial platform would have indicated the intent of the Chinese military,” a senior official said.Senior IAF officials said the loading of air-to-air missiles is a sure indicator of the adversary’s intent as the seekers of missiles have limited shelf life and hence there is no point in loading the fighters with expensive weapons if there is no hostile intention||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-air-activity-goes-down-limited-troop-pullback-effected/story-JOxv2xKp5DSgS19SVhfvKJ.html
11-06-2020||India||Nepal PM criticises Yogi Adityanath’s ‘threatening’ remarks on border row||Nepal Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Wednesday criticised Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for his remarks on a border row, saying the Indian leader should be advised not to make “threatening” remarks.Oli’s remarks were the latest twist in the border dispute between India and Nepal, which erupted last month when Kathmandu protested against the opening of an 80-km road running to Lipulekh on the border with Tibet. Nepal claims the Lipulekh region and the Oli government recently published a new political map that shows the area as part of Nepalese territory.A constitutional amendment to give legal backing to the map was unanimously endorsed by lawmakers from all political parties in the House of Representatives or the lower house of Nepal’s Parliament on Tuesday.Participating in a discussion on the issue in the lower house on Wednesday, Oli was quoted by media reports as saying that India’s central leadership should advise Adityanath not to “threaten” Nepal.“Uttar Pradesh chief minister Adityanath-ji said some things about Nepal. His remarks were not appropriate or legitimate. The leadership of the central government [in India] should tell him not to speak on issues that he is not responsible for. He should also be told that his comments threatening Nepal will be condemned,” Oli said.Oli was also quoted as questioning India’s contention that the regions of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura are part of its territory. He said India had deployed its armed forces in these areas since the early 1960s but they belonged to Nepal.There was no immediate response to Oli’s remarks from Indian officials.During a recent interview, Adityanath had said Nepal should not “repeat the mistake of Tibet” while determining its political boundaries. “Nepal should think of the consequences and remember what happened to Tibet,” he had said.Adityanath also said India and Nepal are two political entities but have one soul.“The two countries have cultural, historical and mythological links that date back several centuries and Nepal should remember this,” he added.While speaking in Parliament, Oli reiterated Nepal’s offer for a dialogue to settle the border issue. He said Nepal is confident about getting its territory back though diplomatic dialogue as its claims are backed by evidence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-pm-criticises-yogi-adityanath-s-threatening-remarks-on-border-row/story-RcMUtqcAcVfyVxUoOqvYpJ.html
11-06-2020||India||India-China sea voyage in PMO panel’s pitch for reforms in heritage management||A cultural exchange on a sea voyage between India and China and turning archaeological sites such as Hampi into on-site museums are among a slew of reforms proposed to improve heritage management recommended by a working group under the chairmanship of NITI Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant. In its 255-page report, the group has flagged gaps such as lack of a national database and documentation of artefacts and heritage sites. Officials at the culture ministry said that the report is under consideration and appropriate action will be taken after it is assessed.The working group was formed by the Prime Minister’s Office in June 2019 and included the secretary, ministry of culture, secretary, ministry of tourism, director general, ASI - member–convenor, member secretary, INTACH and the CEO, Aga Khan Trust for Culture. It was tasked with recommending “institutional changes”, potential ways to involve the local communities and explore the possibility of enhancing tourism and employment through heritage management. According to its report, India has over 500,000 heritage sites and monuments and 3,691 monuments protected by the Archaeological Survey of India. “(A) Cultural exchange on sea voyage proposed between India and China at Mahabalipuram to be initiated under Project Mausam,” states the report. Project Mausam was started by the Central government to better connect countries bordering the Indian Ocean. The report has also highlighted the lack of a centralized database that is leading to artefacts being ignored. “There is no centralised database of archival records, drawings and photo archives,” states the report. “There is no inventory which is maintained centrally, on an all India basis, in the ASI for recording all the artefacts, antiquities and sculptures found and collected during excavations, explorations or village to village survey. In many cases, the excavated antiquities are not even accessed and just stored in the ASI Circle offices, monuments and store rooms.” The report recommends a “systematic photo documentation of all national monuments should be revived, and each monument (should be) documented on a periodic basis”.It has also suggested that ASI should invest in advanced surveys, documentation and monitoring instruments and training sessions to be available on site with various circles. According to Vasant Shinde, department of archaeology, Deccan College, the ASI has already undertaken such a project. “Nearly 50 per cent of the country has been covered by the now,” said Shinde. “A central database like this will help avoid smuggling of artefacts.”The report has also recommended collaborations with Foreign Universities for introduction of latest techniques in exploration and excavations. “ASI should collaborate with National and International organisations for training of staff in use of advanced documentation, survey and monitoring techniques to be used for monuments and archaeological sites.” In the 2020-21 budget, the government has proposed five archaeological sites to be developed as iconic sites with on-site Museums. “These should be completed in next 3 years,” states the report. “The proposed museums are Rakhigarhi (HR), Hastinapur (UP) Shivsagar (Assam), Dholavira (GJ) and Adichanallur (TN). Clear Action Plan to be finalized for all. ASI should finalize world-class projects for 2 site museums Hampi and Sarnath within the next 3 months. A model site museum should also be set up at Ahichchhatra archaeological site in UP.”Shinde said that the step will help boost both employment and tourism. “But we need to remember one thing,” said Shinde. “We are good at creating infrastructure, it is the maintenance of the monuments and new sites that we need to focus on more.” The group has recommended setting up of an “Indian Institute of Culture (IIC)” under the ambit of the ministry of culture for “training and skilling manpower in Archaeology, Conservation, Museology, Archives and related fields to be located at the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyaya Institute of Archeology. The proposed Indian Institute of Culture should be a deemed university, wherein there should be a flexibility to hire experts from other countries.”According to Shinde, this step will go a long way considering it will be a first of its kind institute. “It is required like the IITs. The avenues to study these subjects are limited, historians and archaeologists can be trained here. It is a demand that has been overdue, as India doesn’t have any such institute,” said Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-sea-voyage-in-pmo-panel-s-pitch-for-reforms-in-heritage-management/story-TvF8pCihEjwRqJDEEQIUwL.html
11-06-2020||India||PM Modi, Israel’s Netanyahu discuss expanding cooperation in health, defence||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Israeli counterpart Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday discussed the possibility of expanding bilateral collaboration in health technology, defence and information technology.During a phone conversation, the two leaders “agreed the post-Covid world would create further avenues for mutually beneficial partnerships in many areas”, according to a readout from the external affairs ministry.They discussed potential areas in which India and Israel could expand cooperation in the context of the pandemic, including research and development in vaccines, therapeutics and diagnostics.“They agreed to maintain the ongoing exchanges between expert teams of both countries, and also concurred that the fruits of such collaboration should be made available for the wider benefit of humanity,” the statement said.“In particular, they assessed tremendous scope for expanding the already robust India-Israel collaboration in areas like health technology, agricultural innovation, defence cooperation and information technology,” it added.Modi reiterated his congratulations to Netanyahu for his recent assumption of office, and said the bilateral partnership would continue to flourish under his leadership and guidance. The two leaders agreed to remain in touch to share assessments and consult each other on emerging opportunities and challenges in the changing global scenario.Modi also spoke on the phone with Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Sen and discussed the Covid-19 pandemic. They agreed to continue ongoing cooperation to help each other’s expatriates and facilitate their evacuation.India is committed to strengthening its ties with Cambodia, an important member of Asean, Modi said.The leaders reviewed the bilateral development partnership, including capacity building programmes and quick impact projects under the Mekong-Ganga Cooperation framework.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-israel-s-benjamin-netanyahu-discuss-expanding-cooperation-in-health-defence-and-it/story-X13cfRrTKk4usMrDambOUP.html
11-06-2020||India||Delhi needs 150k beds for Covid-19 patients, looking to scale up capacity: CM||Delhi will need 150,000 beds by the end of July if its hospitals are to also treat coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients from other states, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday, even as he promised to implement “in letter and spirit” Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal’s order overruling the Delhi government’s decision to only allow Delhi residents to be treated in government and private hospitals in the state. By July 15, Delhi will need 33,000 beds, and including those from outside the city, it will require 65,000, the chief minister added. “By July 31, 80,000 beds were projected for the people of Delhi. But now, we will need a total of 150,000 beds.” His comments came against the backdrop of a sharp increase in the number of cases in Delhi. On Tuesday, the state added 1,366 news cases and on Wednesday, it added 1,501. Delhi’s dashboard on Wednesday night stood at 32,810 cases, with 12,245 recoveries, and 984 deaths. Separately, Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain said there is community transmission in Delhi, repeating what he said on Tuesday, but added that only the Centre could declare this. Referring to the Delhi data, Kejriwal termed the task of arranging over a 100,000 beds an “unprecedented and a huge challenge”. He asked neighbouring states such as Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to augment their health infrastructure to ensure that people from there do not have to come to Delhi for treatment. Kejriwal emphasised that this was not the time to fight over differences and appealed to all political parties, religious institutions, doctors and the public to jointly fight the Covid-19 pandemic. He called for a people’s movement for promoting the wearing of masks and ensuring social distancing and personal hygiene for the purpose. “The Centre has taken a decision and the L-G passed an order accordingly. There is no room for disagreements now. The decision of the L-G will be implemented in letter and spirit. There is no dispute on this subject anymore and I want to make this clear to everyone, including the members and workers of our own party [Aam Aadmi Party],” Kejriwal said at a digital press conference a day after he tested negative for Covid-19.Later in the evening, he met home minister Amit Shah. “Met Sh Amit Shah, Honble HM. Discussed the situation on corona in Delhi in detail. He assured of all cooperation,” Kejriwal said on Twitter. Baijal on Monday also restored national guidelines on who can be tested for Covid-19 in the Capital; the Delhi government had said only high-risk direct contacts of infected people would be tested if they were asymptomatic. The Delhi government’s orders on both testing and treatment created a huge controversy. On Wednesday, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) issued notice to the state government and the Union ministry of health for alleged mismanagement of the situation in the national capital. The notices were prompted by a complaint made by Congress leader Ajay Maken. Kejriwal’s deputy, Manish Sisodia, had on Monday, in a digital press briefing, attacked the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over Baijal’s order and said the Centre must involve states in decision-making processes. He accused the BJP of pressurising the L-G into overturning their decisions. On Tuesday, the deputy CM alleged that the L-G had no plan even after reversing the Delhi Cabinet’s decision to accommodate the huge influx in patients.Baijal is the government’s administrative head and reports to the President. He is the topmost authority of the Delhi disaster management agency, which is coordinating all matters related to the pandemic. On Tuesday, his office issued a statement saying the L-G had clarified to Sisodia that right to health is an integral part of the right to life under the Constitution of India. Baijal had said that rather than “discriminating between patients, the goal of the government should be to plan and prepare for adequate infrastructure”. In his Monday order, Baijal acknowledged that Covid-19 has spread in Delhi “in threatening proportion”.Kejriwal said he will soon begin inspections to monitor the arrangements. “I will get started on this and go to stadiums, banquet halls and hotels to make arrangements. We will try everything, do whatever we can to ensure enough hospital beds.”A committee, which has been constituted under the chairmanship of divisional commissioner Sanjeev Khirwar to explore the possibility of creating additional bed capacity, has so far suggested that Pragati Maidan and Talkatora indoor stadium be used as makeshift hospitals.On the basis of the current doubling rate of 12.6 days, the Delhi health department has projected that the number of active cases in Delhi will touch 60,004 by June 30; 134,722 by July 15 and 319,237 by July 31.Kejriwal said the fight against Covid-19 has to be turned into a people’s movement. “We need to keep in mind three things: wearing masks, washing hands regularly and maintaining social distancing. People should encourage each other to follow this.”Kejriwal added that 1,900 people have been hospitalised in Delhi government hospitals over the last eight days. He attributed most of the hospitalisations to the Delhi Corona App launched on June 2 to allow people to check availability of hospital beds on a real-time basis. “... around 200 people [also] faced difficulty in getting beds. Nearly 4,200 beds are still vacant, but they are mostly in Delhi government hospitals. Private hospitals are mostly full. We are working on increasing the bed capacity in that sector,” said Kejriwal.The Delhi government on Tuesday issued an order asking 22 private to increase the number of beds reserved for Covid-19 patients by 2,015. The capacity in these private hospitals has now gone up to 3,456 from 1,441 beds. With this, the number of beds has increased from 8,872 to 10,887 in Delhi.The fatality rate in Delhi currently is 2.92%, which is higher than the national average of 2.81%. Delhi is conducting 13,433 tests per million as compared to the national average of 3,797 tests per million, according to government data. Till Monday, Delhi had conducted 266,156 tests. Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said that instead of complaining about the L-G’s decisions, the Kejriwal government should back his demand with data. “I demand that the chief minister release the detailed figures on how many Covid-19 patients from which states other than Delhi were treated in Delhi, how many of them recovered and how many died. They have just been raising this issue to hide their mismanagement of the pandemic,” he said. Meanwhile, as anecdotes of hospitals overcharging patients continued to do the rounds, L-G Baijal said all major hospitals, clinics and nursing homes in Delhi will have to display near their entrance, room charges and availability of beds on a real-time basis. In a directive issued to chief secretary Vijay Dev on Wednesday, Baijal also asked him to deploy officials to conduct surprise inspections in all hospitals to keep a check on malpractices such as overcharging or false refusal of beds. Baijal also asked the health department to ensure that the data displayed on the boards near the entrance is reconciled with the data available on the Delhi Corona App and the delhifightscorona.in web portal. Dr Lalit Kant, the former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said it is not surprising that cases in Delhi have seen a spurt. “That’s what lifting the lockdown does. More people are bound to get infected. But, during the two-month long intense lockdown a lot of arrangements should already have been completed by the authorities. Now, the authorities must think on their feet and just go all out in expanding their health infrastructure,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-150k-beds-looking-to-scale-up-capacity-cm/story-GDKRro1j9dv4njXzsTu5CK.html
11-06-2020||India||Deaths near 1,000 as Delhi logs spike in Covid-19 fatalities, cases||Delhi recorded one of its deadliest days for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients with official figures released on Wednesday showing that 48 of them died on Tuesday, which was also a day when the number of new infections crept back up above the 1,500 mark. According to latest government data, the national capital has now had 32,810 infections – of these 19,581 are active cases – and 984 of these have succumbed to the disease. In all, the government’s health bulletin added 79 to the Covid-19 death toll and 1,501 cases that tested positive on Tuesday. In Delhi, the new infections came from 5,077 tests, which takes the disease confirmation rate to close to 30% -- the highest it has ever been.The number has been increasing steadily this month, a trend that experts say indicates that the outbreak may be wider than known as more tests have the potential to uncover more cases. The government released two sets of numbers on Wednesday, after having failed to release the daily health bulletin on Tuesday. The health bulletin includes infection, fatality and testing numbers recorded in the 24-hour period the previous day.“There were a lot of meetings yesterday. It went on till late night. So, in between all that it (health bulletin) got missed. It was ready,” Delhi health minister Satyender Jain said while talking to reporters on Wednesday. According to senior government officials who asked not to be named, the bulletin was ready but officials who were meant to give final approvals had been busy in meetings. “The bulletin has to go through multiple layers of approvals every day before it is actually released. It was ready yesterday, but some officials who had to sign it were in meetings. So going from one officer to other for signature took time,” said this person. The document was eventually released around 5am on Wednesday. According to this bulletin, there were 1,366 cases on Monday and 34 fatalities were added to the Covid-19 death toll. Of these, 7 took place in the immediate 24-hour period. Fatalities are routinely added to older dates since each Covid-19 death is vetted by a team of doctors and officials to confirm the cause of death. The test confirmation rate, also known as the positivity rate, was 25% for Monday.The Delhi government is working on scaling-up its health infrastructure over the next month after its projections showed cases could reach as high as 550,000 by the end of July. Experts, however, said the projected numbers should not be a cause for concern.Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital, said, “The disease is such that a lot of people are likely to get infected. Even if we assume a low number of 10% of the population, it still means two million people will get infected in Delhi, which has a population of two crore.”“However, most of the infections will be mild. Our focus now has to be on not creating panic about it and ensuring people who need treatment, get it. We have beds, we have everything, but there is no coordination and guidelines are changing every day. People are dying because of lacunae of the system. What we need is effective management of the health care system,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deaths-near-1-000-as-city-logs-spike-in-fatalities-cases/story-7heBJo1j2bVjX7BRj2XSZI.html
11-06-2020||India||In a first, recovery count exceeds active Covid-19 infections||The total number of people who have recovered from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crossed the number of active cases in India for the first time since the start of the outbreak in March.As of Tuesday evening, the number of recovered patients exceeded the number of active cases by 1,375, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.In the last week, an average of 4,529 new active cases have been added to the national tally every day, while 5,397 patients have recovered daily. If these trajectories continue, this gap is likely to widen in the coming days.One of key factors for the number of recoveries catching up to active cases has been India’s low case fatality rate (CFR). Since 2.8% of infected people have died so far, the number of active cases (calculated by subtracting the number of recovered patients and deaths from the total tally) has been steadily dropping, particularly from the end of May.Active cases outnumbered the total recovered patients throughout the outbreak until Tuesday – the gap peaking on May 11, when active cases had a 23,511-case lead. Recoveries soon picked up pace as patients, particularly the 155,668 new cases reported through May, started getting discharged. On May 29, India reported 11,707 new recoveries (highest in a single day so far), helped by Maharashtra that discharged 8,381 asymptomatic patients in one day.In fact, from May 15, new recoveries have been regularly higher than the average daily active case.The development also came on the same day that the total number of tests conducted in the country crossed the 5 million-mark, according the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). As of Tuesday night, India tested 5,061,332 samples.This means India has conducted 3,797 tests for every million residents – the lowest among the 10 worst-hit countries in the world. Italy, which has over 50,000 fewer cases than India, has conducted over 71,000 tests per million population; Spain which has a few thousand more cases than India has conducted over 95,000 tests per million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-recovery-count-exceeds-active-infections/story-PncjU90z66lvJRYnGMh3DK.html
11-06-2020||India||22 terrorists killed over past two weeks in J-K||Security forces shot dead five terrorists of the Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and the Hizbul Mujahideen in south Kashmir’s Shopian district on Wednesday, officials said after the third successful operation in the region in four days.A top district commander of the Hizbul was gunned down in the encounter, according to officials who did not immediately reveal the identities of those killed. Officials also said the operation once again proved that the Pakistan-based LeT and the local Hizbul group were working together in the Valley. Wednesday’s action was the third such operation within 96 hours in Shopian, considered a hotbed of militancy. While five terrorists were killed on Sunday, four more were shot dead the next day.Following inputs of the presence of terrorists in Sugoo village, the police, Rashtriya Rifles and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) launched a joint cordon-and-search operation in the area early on Wednesday.The terrorists fired at the security team, triggering a gunfight that lasted around eight hours, according to the police. After the encounter ended, the police recovered the bodies of the terrorists along with arms from their possession.“I congratulate our forces for showing the highest order of professionalism, which led to no collateral damage,” Kashmir inspector general Vijay Kumar said. He added that the bodies of the terrorists were sent to Baramulla for last rites.For the past one month, the police are not handing over the bodies of terrorists to their family members, fearing gatherings at funerals in violation of guidelines drafted to halt the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Twenty-two terrorists, including six top commanders, have been killed over the past two weeks in nine different operations in the region, Jammu and Kashmir director general of police Dilbag Singh said on Monday. He added then that a total of 88 terrorists had been killed since January in 36 operations.On that day, terrorists gunned down a sarpanch, Ajay Pandita, in Anantnag district neighbouring Shopian. The police said the Hizbul was behind the killing.On Wednesday, the police recovered the body of Tariq Ahmed Paul, a resident of Shopian, in the district’s Kongnu area. Paul lived close to the area where the four terrorists were killed in the Monday encounter. The police said he was kidnapped by terrorists and killed after being tortured. Paul’s house was damaged in the encounter in Pinjora village.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-terrorists-killed-14-shot-dead-in-4-days/story-ua1GFeAFfpU8zmsHfdeSZJ.html
11-06-2020||India||Prisoners freed to decongest Tihar return to crime||On April 30, Balbir Sharma, a man with 36 cases of theft, robbery and snatching registered against him was released from Tihar jail as part of the prison’s move to decongest its premises to contain the spread of Covid-19. Five days later, he was arrested for allegedly robbing a man of his cell phone and scooter. A day before Sharma‘s release, Monu Sharma, a man with eight criminal cases, was also released in a bid to decongest the jail complex. Six days later, on May 5, he was arrested for stealing an electric autorickshaw in east Delhi’s Geeta Colony.Two months ago, the Delhi government released around 2,800 prisoners to decongest the prison complex as one of the steps to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The released prisoners included 1,000 under-trials who were let off on bail while the others were convicts released on parole.The records of arrested people over the last one month show that many released prisoners are back to a life of crime. Delhi Police has, in the past one month, arrested at least 129 such prisoners again after suspecting their involvement in cases of robbery, snatching, theft and burglary in different parts of the city.“After the lockdown norms were eased and we started receiving reports of regular crimes from different parts of the city, our police teams launched a crackdown on such criminals,” a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, said .”Our investigation showed that many of them were those who were released during the lockdown. In ideal circumstances they would be in prison while the courts conduct trial. The prison department released them but instead of appreciating the decision, they are back to crime. We have sent them back. The prison authorities must verify the records of each prisoner before letting them off.”Another police officer said that though the police were proactive in arresting snatchers and robbers across the city, their efforts would be in vain if the prison keeps releasing habitual criminals.“The 129 prisoners we arrested again are those whom we could trace. The actual number of such released criminals who are again active could be more,” the second officer added.Reacting to the arrest of the released prisoners, a senior prison officer, who wished to remain anonymous, said they are complying with the court’s orders and are only releasing prisoners who were arrested in crimes for which the punishment is less than seven years. “Many prisoners who were arrested in non-heinous cases (punishment less than seven years) such as theft, snatching, burglary were released in March and April. We only release those who have one or few cases. Snatching and theft come under those categories. We analyse each case before releasing them. It is only done on the basis of the prisoner’s jail conduct.”The prison officer added that such prisoners are only released on interim bail and their cases will be analysed once the pandemic has subsides. Prison expert, Sunil Gupta, who was a law officer in Tihar for over three decades, said releasing prisoners who had barely spent a week behind bars back to the society had threatened the city’s law and order. “ I am all for releasing prisoners. A jail is a reformation centre. The prison department should have released those prisoners who had spent many years in prison and were part of the reformation exercises. You have instead released habitual criminals, who barely stayed for a month behind bars. They will definitely go out and commit crimes. They may be petty criminals, such as snatchers and burglars, but once out of prison without any reformation, they are a threat to the city’s law and order,” Gupta said.Gupta also offered a solution. The former law officer said that instead of decongesting the jail by releasing such prisoners, the prison department should house them in a temporary jail outside the prison complex. “The jail manual authorises the government to make a temporary prison in these times. They could make a school complex or a playground as a jail and house the prisoners there. We have done it in the past. Releasing unreformed habitual criminals within a month is a knee-jerk reaction that must be avoided. This will bring chaos.” Housing over 18,000 prisoners, Tihar jail is the most populated prison across the country. There are three prison complexes under Tihar -- Tihar, Rohini and Mandoli. In April, the jail authorities released around 2,800 prisoners - under-trials and convicts -- on interim bail and extended parole to reduce the population within the jail. With thousands of prisoners living in close proximity, jail officers feared that the coronavirus disease would spread rapidly if the prison was not decongested. The three prisons have collectively reported 20 cases of Covid-19, which includes 17 prisoners and three jailors. None of the cases were detected in June. Retired Indian Police Service officer Prakash Singh, who served as the police chief of Uttar Pradesh, Border Security Force and the Assam Police, said the police must document the cases of such prisoners and present it in court. Singh also said the prison department must introspect on the files of each prisoner they release.“They were released on humanitarian grounds but if they refuse to mend their ways, the punishment should be enhanced. Many of them are habitual criminals, who made nothing during the lockdown. They are not salaried or work anywhere so they depend on the earnings from the crime. Once released, they may be trying to make them up for lost months and are back to their business. The prison department must carefully scrutinise each case before releasing such criminal, ” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prisoners-freed-to-decongest-tihar-return-to-crime/story-KuyfNbrmi9f9J2wx9eW75N.html

11-06-2020||India||ED brings back jewels owned by Nirav Modi, Mehul Choksi||The Enforcement Directorate on Wednesday morning brought back 108 consignments of polished diamonds, silver jewellery and pearls worth Rs 1,350 crore declared value belonging to diamantaire Nirav Modi and his uncle Mehul Choksi from Hong Kong, officials said, adding that it was one of the biggest seizures from abroad.The agency said that the consignments weighing around 2,340kg were seized in July 2018 with the help of Hong Kong authorities on specific information and was brought to Mumbai on Wednesday after completing legal formalities.The consignments were sent from Dubai to Hong Kong by the accused in July 2018, the time when the investigation against them was at its peak and they were trying to dispose of their assets, said the officials cited above.“The authorities were continuously engaged in discussion with various authorities in Hong Kong to bring back these valuables to India. Various modalities were finalised and after completing all the legal formalities these consignments have now been brought back to India,” a statement by the ED said.The agency will get the jewellery valued independently considering Modi and Choksi used to overvalue all their items in the retail market.“We believe that it won’t fetch more than Rs 150 crore in the Indian market,” said an officer, who didn’t wish to be named.“Value of these goods has been declared to be Rs 1,350 crores (approx). These valuables include polished diamonds, pearls, pearl and silver jewelry etc. and were kept in the godown of a logistics company in Hong Kong,” an official statement from the agency said. Earlier, ED had managed to bring 33 consignments of valuables worth Rs 137 crore belonging to Choksi in 2018 from Dubai and Hong Kong.A second officer lauded Hong Kong authorities for their cooperation in last two years in the Nirav Modi case. “We have had great cooperation from agencies in Hong Kong, who have not only allowed us to seize and bring the valuables to India but shared crucial information about Modi and Choksi’s companies too,” the second officer said. Another officer said that the Punjab National Bank (PNB) scam, involving Modi and his uncle Choksi, is the first case where ED has managed to bring property from abroad. The team of ED’s Joint Director in Mumbai Satyabrata Kumar, who also investigated Vijay Mallya case, is responsible for bringing the property back to India.On Monday, a Mumbai court allowed confiscation of Nirav Modi’s assets worth around Rs 1,400 crore under the newly enacted Fugitive Economic Offenders’ Act.Both are wanted in Rs 13,578 crore PNB fraud unearthed in early 2018. While Modi is currently lodged in a prison in the UK as his extradition is being pursued by Indian authorities, Choksi is in Antigua and Barbuda.Modi and Choksi’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal refused to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-brings-back-jewels-owned-by-nirav-choksi/story-frafMeWvBmv7xTqAMDbkFN.html
11-06-2020||India||Agriculture ministry sets up wing to push recent reforms||The agriculture ministry has created a cell to modernize farm logistics and supply value chains in line with the recent announcements of reforms in the sector by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman. This includes making amendments to the six-decade-old Essential Commodities Act and pushing two ordinances — freeing up farm trade from all restrictions and guaranteeing a legal framework for pre-agreed prices to farmers — an official said, requesting anonymity.The reforms cell will help coordinate efforts to streamline supply and transportation of farm produce, and also aid projects to add value to primary farm goods for better prices to the farmers, the official said.The agriculture ministry is gearing up to new challenges and making all preparations in the wake of the government’s decision to free agricultural markets of middlemen, who often take a sizeable cut of value from the produce sold.The reforms cell will additionally look after a national mission of “One District One Crop” to boost crop diversity. The reforms cell will play a key role, according to the official, in the aftermath of changes such as amendments to The Essential Commodities Act of 1955.“Farmers have been unable to get better prices due to lack of investment in cold storage, processing and export as the entrepreneurial spirit gets dampened due to hanging sword of Essential Commodities Act,” a recent official statement had stated.The government hopes that scaling back the ECA, 1955, will help drive up investment in cold storages and the food supply chain. Cold storages are refrigerated warehouses that can store perishables for up to six months. Refrigerated old stocks can cool food prices in times of scarcity.The ECA was mainly used to curb inflation by empowering the Union and state governments to dictate quantities traders can store and also restrict the movement of any commodity deemed “essential”. Under the law, the government generally imposes stock limits to discourage hoarding of items such as pulses and vegetables.The government last week promulgated ‘The Farming Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, 2020’. The ordinance, which is a law promulgated when Parliament is not in session, effectively brings down the curtains on the decades-old agricultural produce market committees regulations (APMC) system that regulates buying and selling of farm produce.APMC regulations require farmers to only sell to licensed middlemen in notified markets, usually in the same area where farmers reside, rather than in an open market, scuttling price discovery. “The agriculture ministry will facilitate through new initiatives that will help farmers take full advantage of the recent reforms,” the official said.Ushered in during the 1960s, APMC regulations were meant to protect farmers from distress selling. Over time, these have often turned into cartels and monopolies, evidence suggests.In December 2010, when onion prices peaked, a probe by the country’s statutory anti-monopoly body, the Competition Commission of India, revealed that one firm accounted for nearly a fifth of the total onion trade for that month at Lasalgoan APMC, Asia’s largest onion market in Maharashtra’s Nashik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/agri-ministry-sets-up-wing-to-push-recent-reforms/story-mUwMlcCZzaIDDMMfr6UK6K.html
11-06-2020||India||33 Covid-19 labs in UP, most in big cities||Sunil Bansal, a resident of Varanasi, was first tested for Covid-19 on May 17. His sample returned a positive report on May 28, 11 days later. Since then, he has been in an isolation facility in the Pandeypur area of the city. Another sample of his was taken on June 5, when he was deemed cured. “It’s five days now, but the report hasn’t come. I can’t leave the centre until the report comes,” said Bansal, a pharmacist who was on railway station duty when he tested positive.The number — there are only 33 laboratories testing for Covid — and concentration (most are in the big cities) of testing facilities in Uttar Pradesh is making people wait for days to know their status. Experts say this is worrying; they point to another cause for concern — UP has currently tested only 1,740 people per million residents, lower than the national average of 3,797 and far below other states. Maharashtra has done 4,730 tests per million for instance; Tamil Nadu, 8,206; and Rajasthan, 6,860.To be sure, the state does average of 12,500 tests per day but this is well short of what is needed, the experts said. Uttar Pradesh has a population of 224 million, according to Census of India projections.State surveillance officer Dr Vikasendu Agrawal said, “UP’s per case testing ratio is better than several other states. The state has reported 11,610 cases till now.”Bansal’s sample, like all other samples from Varanasi, are tested at Banaras Hindu University (BHU). The same lab also tests samples from Sonbhadra, Mirzapur, Jaunpur, Bhadohi, Ghazipur, Mau, Azamgarh and Ballia districts, which collectively have a population of about 25 million people. The lab can test a maximum of 330 samples in a day.“Delay in the test report is a double blow. First, an infected person may be moving around. Second, a cured patient’s stay may get prolonged in an isolation centre,” said Sunil Yadav, president of the government pharmacist federation, Uttar Pradesh.The situation at BRD Medical College in Gorakhpur is similar.“We test samples for seven districts in Gorakhpur and Basti and have a capacity of about 1,000 tests per day,” said Dr Ganesh Kumar, principal of the college.The Meerut testing centre, at Lala Lajpat Rai Medical College, tests samples from the adjoining districts of Baghpat, Saharanpur, Shamli, Muzaffarnagar, Bulandshahr, Ghaziabad, Noida, Bijnor and Hapur.Out of the total 34,000 samples tested this far in the Meerut lab, 16,132 were from Meerut and 17,868 of other districts. On paper, the average time taken for testing samples is 68 hours, a little short of three days. The lab at Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College (JNMC), Aligarh Muslim University, caters to the districts of Kasganj, Hathras, Etah, Mathura, Badaun and Aligarh.This lab has thus far conducted more than 16,000 tests. In Agra, a hotspot of the coronavirus disease, the labs are at Sarojini Naidu Medical College and Jalma Institute for Leprosy & Other Mycobacterial Diseases. There are also three private labs. Cases from nearby districts too reach Agra.Lucknow has seven government labs and the reporting time is between 24 and 36 hours for coronavirus samples. King George’s Medical University lab receives samples from districts also such as Barabanki, Gonda, Bahraich, Hardoi, Sitapur, Unnao, Ayodhya, Farrukhabad, Sambhal, Shahjahanpur, Kannauj and Hathras.KGMU’s microbiology lab tests around 1200 samples each day.Despite the delays, the state is better off now than it was a few months back, according to a state health department officer who added that in February, UP sent samples to National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune and National Centre for Disease Control, Delhi.It was only later that testing started at labs in KGMU, Lucknow and JLNMC, AMU, Aligarh . From mid- March, testing also started at medical colleges in Meerut, Agra, Prayagraj and Gorakhpur. Now, 22 government laboratories and 11 private laboratories are testing samples in the state. Still, the daily pendency of samples was 9,000, the officer added, asking not to be named.Seven of Uttar Pradesh’s 22 government labs are in Lucknow. They collectively conduct over 2,000 tests a day.There are two labs each in Agra and Gorakhpur. The other districts with a lab are: Prayagraj, Jhansi, Aligarh, Noida, Meerut, Saifai (Etawah), Bareilly, Kanpur, Greater Noida, and Varanasi. Eleven other private labs were also allowed to test samples.“Uneven distribution of labs is a threat as we will fail to know the spread in districts where the lab facility is poor. But as people from there will migrate for work, the infection will spread to other places,” said Dr PK Gupta, former president of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), Lucknow.Principal secretary, health and medical welfare, Amit Mohan Prasad said the state government is increasing the testing capacity. Testing of samples started in four more hospitals on Wednesday, he added.“ The state government has decided to set up virology laboratories in all the 75 district hospitals and work on this has started,” he said.Surveillance officer Agrawal added: “TrueNat Machines have been installed in all 75 districts and will be used for testing samples of suspected coronavirus patients.” These are portable battery operated machines originally meant for the detection of tuberculosis. UP reported the first coronavirus case on March 2 and till now about four lakh (400,000) samples have been tested.Given the size of the state (UP’s land area is 243,290 square kilometres, if it were a country it would be the 78th largest in terms of land area), it takes time for samples from some districts to reach hospitals. “One person carrying samples from Azamgarh to Varanasi will take over three hours to reach. And if all samples of the district are to be collected, the delay in samples reaching the lab could be 12 hours, which means the test report can take over 48 hours to reach the patient/doctor,” added Dr Gupta. “Having one lab for five or seven districts is practically unworkable. Ideally, there should be one lab in each district or at least one lab between two districts,” he added. UP will have to get innovative with its testing, Dr Gupta said, suggesting antibody tests. “It’s a simple test and can tell the spread of virus authentically.” Dr RB Singh, former additional director (administration) in the state health department, said, “Uttar Pradesh at present is not aware of where it stands in terms of coronavirus cases. In fact, only aggressive testing can tell this status. Hence, it should be increased swiftly so that we know the accurate number of cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/33-covid-labs-in-up-most-in-big-cities/story-ighdhpnakKqSzIvDP9Uk3O.html
11-06-2020||India||Firms make efforts to bring back migrants, restart work||Megha Engineering and Infrastructure Limited (MEIL), a Hyderabad-based construction company, has brought back about 1,000 workers, who had returned to their villages in Bihar, West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh during the lockdown enforced on March 25 to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The builder paid the workers’ train fare to resume construction work on the Polavaram multi-purpose project on the Godavari river in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district, company officials said on Tuesday. Some 1,800 more workers will be brought back soon, they said.Over 3,000 migrant workers had left the company and returned to their home states in the exodus of workers that followed the lockdown, MEIL general manager Satish Angana said.“Till now, around 1,000 workers had been ferried back to Andhra Pradesh through Shramik Special trains at the company’s expense. Another 1,800 workers are expected to be brought back shortly,” said another company executive, who didn’t want to be named. Angana said all the returnees had been tested at special medical camps for Covid-19 and before returning to workAs the central and state governments battle to revive a stalled national economy and restart industrial activity, companies like Megha Engineering are being proactive in bringing back workers who had returned to their home states fearing a loss of work and wages.The Centre informed the Supreme Court last week that close to 10 million workers had been sent back to their homes on Shramik Special trains that started from May 1.Employers need the workers, especially the skilled ones, to restart work, and haven’t stinted from offering them higher wages, better working conditions and paying their train -- even flight -- fares to bring them back.The trend, backed by anecdotal evidence of workers returning to cities like Mumbai, illustrates, too, the vital role played by migrant labour from states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal in keeping the economy running in economically better-off states in southern and western India. Bangalore-based real estate developer Prestige Group has flown 10 carpenters from Patna to Hyderabad where it has launched a big real estate project. “One of our contractors booked flight tickets for these 10 carpenters from Patna to Hyderabad. We have to complete the projects before the deadline fixed by the Real Estate Regulatory Authority and deliver the flats to the customers,” a senior vice-president of Prestige Group told a news agency.Bobby Jindal, owner of Balaji Processors, a blanket maker based in Punjab’s Ludhiana, brought back seven of his master craftsmen by flights from Patna.“I was left with less than 50 workers at my unit which adversely affected production. I booked air tickets for seven master workers who took a flight from Patna to Delhi and then from Delhi to Sahnewal Airport in Ludhiana last week,” Jindal said, adding that he had also arranged two taxis and booked train tickets for some other workers who left Balaji Processors. “I have spent Rs 2 lakh on bringing 50 workers back in the last few days.”Rahul Verma, who runs a manufacturing unit Ludhiana, brought back five skilled workers back from Bihar who were needed in the casting unit. “For some other workers, I have booked their tickets and paid them to return,” he said.In Rajasthan, from where workers go to other states looking for work, some industry owners have offered to arrange transport for workers to return. Sunil Jain, president of the Rajasthan chapter of the Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), said the real estate and construction sector had been hit with a 30 to 40% shortage of workers because of the exodus. Most workers have returned to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand.“I know of some real estate firms that are trying to get labourers back through contractors. Contractors are in touch with the workers and are convincing them to return, assuring them that they will get full work and wages. A few have even sent vehicles to ferry workers back and promised higher wages,” he said.Garment exporters in Rajasthan have been confronting a 70% shortage of labourers and problems in meeting the delivery deadlines, said Aseem Kumar, general secretary of the Garment Exporters Association of Rajasthan. “Some units have offered a 50% increase in wages to deliver pending orders. They are offering higher wages, accommodation and even promising work for the whole year but labourers are not ready to return,” he said. Most of the garment exports from Rajasthan are destined for Japan, the US, Europe and South America.Charanjit Singh Vishwakarma, former president of United Cycle Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) in Ludhiana, said he had already sent money to three of his labour contractors in Bihar to bring back workers. ) “As trains have not fully resumed, the workers are finding it difficult to get confirmed tickets to come via train. The government should restart Shramik trains to bring them back,” he said. “Some factory owners have also offered a higher salary for workers returning immediately. They are also paying for their train tickets,” Tarsem Jodhan, president of the Punjab Mazdoor Union.To revive industrial production in the state, the Punjab government last week sent two buses to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to bring back workers. “I have arranged buses to bring back workers to industrial towns,” said Punjab industries minister Sham Sunder Arora after a meeting with industrialists in Ludhiana last Friday.The Rajasthan government has offered to help industry in getting workers back from other states, provided employers bear the cost of their transport. Labour secretary Niraj K Pawan said, “If industry provides us details of districts from which they want the labourers back, we will coordinate with those states and facilitate the transport of the workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/firms-make-efforts-to-bring-back-migrants-restart-work/story-P366yVK5SwrQi042AVbREP.html
11-06-2020||India||70k rural roads, 5 million houses among job avenues for migrants||Building of nearly 70,000 kilometres of rural roads and five million houses for the poor are employment avenues lined up for migrants returning to their villages as an overwhelming number of them are construction workers, officials familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The officials said the rural development ministry asked states to engage the large number of construction workers—estimated to be more than two-thirds of the total returning workers—in these two types of work to provide opportunities to match their skills.The availability of additional workforce would also help the government meet its annual target of building roads and PMAY (Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana) houses in time and avoid the rush to only grab MGNREGS jobs.According to an official, under the third phase of the PM’s rural road scheme, about 14,000 kilometres of new roads are left to be constructed while there is also pending work from the previous year and an ambitious target of upgrading old roads.A senior official said funding for constructing houses was already budgeted for. He pointed out construction workers could also get 90/95 days of wages for building houses under the PMAY.“With so many houses yet to be built, the construction sector workers who have returned to their villages can find a job of their choice instead of digging earth under MGNREGS,” said an official.According to official data on the rural road scheme or PMGSY (Pradhan Mantri Grameen Sadak Yojana), of the 174,000 road works approved, 157,000 have been completed. This includes both new roads and upgraded existing ones.Similarly, in the housing project, PMAY, a target was set for 6.15 million houses in this financial year. So far, 195,000 houses have been sanctioned. According to data available with the ministry, not a single house has been completed so far. Experts pointed out the lockdown and related issues resulted in the delay and in the month of April, hardly any work was taken up as states were not prepared to roll out the requirements.Both these projects—roads and houses—are key to rural development. While the housing scheme provides the rural poor with their own homes, the road network makes it easier to commute and helps farmers reach mandis with their produce.The rural housing project, along with the Ujjwala cooking gas connection scheme and the Saubhagya power programme, is a vital pivot of the government’s focus on creating individual assets.Another official, however, added that road and housing schemes would only be a part of the larger aim of the government to accommodate millions of jobless migrant workers. The government is also weighing other options including horticulture, animal husbandry and a programme to upgrade their skills during this period.An employment generation and skill upgrade programme, which includes district-wise mapping of workers and identifying their skill-sets, is being designed by the Prime Minister’s Office with the help of the rural development, agriculture, animal husbandry, skill development and road transport ministries.The initiative for migrant workers will not entail any additional financial support from the exchequer, but existing centrally sponsored and central sector schemes—such as MGNREGS, PMAY and PMGSY—will be used to address a situation the officials cited above described as extraordinary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/70k-rural-roads-5-million-houses-among-job-avenues-for-migrants/story-NqcYpyzIcRNsP9w5upP7IJ.html
11-06-2020||India||Staff trouble hits pvt labs, Covid-19 testing still to peak in Delhi||Covid-19 testing remained low in Delhi on Wednesday because of delays in staff registrations that prevented some laboratories from beginning sample collection two days after lieutenant governor Anil Baijal reversed a Delhi government and allowed seven labs to conduct tests for the disease again, multiple representatives of the labs said.On average, 6,129 samples were being tested during the week ending May 31. This came down to an average of 5,590 tests daily during the week that ended on June 7, data from the daily health bulletin shows. The tests conducted dropped from 5,042 on June 7 to 3,700 on June 8, the lowest since the first week of May. They again rose to 5,464 on June 9 but fell to 5077 tests on Wednesday.With Baijal’s order, Delhi’s capacity for testing increased by about 8,000 tests daily but the representatives said the capacity cannot be utilised unless all private labs start testing.Baijal’s order allowed Lal PathLabs, City X-Ray and Scan Clinic, Prognosis Laboratory, SRL Diagnostics, Star Imaging Path Laboratory, Pathkind Labs, and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) to recollect samples. The Delhi government on June 5 served show cause notices to the seven labs for testing asymptomatic patients “without following testing protocols”.Dr Lal PathLabs and SRL Diagnostics said they did not collect samples on Wednesday and would be unable to say when will they begin doing so. “We cannot test in Delhi until our personnel, who collect samples are registered with the Delhi government. That registration is not complete for all districts yet. We only do home collections for Covid-19. So they have to be registered for them to use the government [testing] app,” said Dr Vandana Lal, whole-time director, Dr Lal PathLabs.Dr Lal PathLabs is the largest privately-owned chain of laboratories in the country and has the highest testing capacity in the city, about 4,000 samples daily.When called, SRL Diagnostics lab executive said “We are not testing covid 19 samples now. We may start soon.”City X-Ray and Scan Clinic and Star Imaging Path Laboratory had started collecting samples. Representatives of Prognosis Laboratory and PathKind Labs did not answer calls from HT for comments.Gen X Diagnostics had not also started collecting samples while CRL Diagnostics said they will start doing so in a couple of days. Officials said NCDC has also started receiving samples from the government hospitals.The Indian Council of Medical Research, India’s apex health research body, has approved 16 government and 22 private laboratories in Delhi for Covid-19 testing.Among other labs, Lifeline Laboratory said they cannot accept Covid-19 samples because they were running at full capacity. Dr Dangs Laboratory was also not accepting home collection bookings on Wednesday.Many complained that the red-tapism was delaying testing of lots of people with Covid-19 symptoms.“Why Covid 19 testing is not being provided by private laboratories in Delhi? I am trying for the test for my uncle since four days and every lab is saying call after sometime. Tests are not available, procedure for reporting to government is not clear” tweeted Nitin Anand, an engineer, on Wednesday.Anand said his uncle has been running a fever and has a bad cough for a week. “I first put his symptoms on the Aarogya Setu app but we did not get any calls from health workers. Then I called 1075 helpline which went unanswered. Finally, my uncle’s physician recommended a Covid-19 test because all other tests are normal but all the private labs are asking me to call later. There seems to be a lot of confusion. Precious time is being lost,” he said.“Phlebotomists have to be registered in all 11 districts. If they submit the documents, the registration should happen in 24 hours. There’s no such delay from our end,” a government spokesperson said.The testing process is complicated. People who want to get tested will have to go to a doctor for a prescription, for a test, get a referral form signed by that doctor, and then look for a laboratory that will test them. Even if they did manage to get these documents, getting tested would be a tedious process because all private laboratories are not functioning. The option for those who want to get tested is then to go to the hospitals or testing centres directly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/staff-trouble-hits-pvt-labs-testing-still-to-peak-in-city/story-CpqNINptYEJberxqb5PywI.html
11-06-2020||India||NLU arranges train to ferry over 1,600 migrants home||Around 1,650 migrant workers were ferried from Gujarat to Jharkhand on a Shramik Special train arranged by the Legal Aid and Awareness Committee(LAAC) of the National Law University, Jodhpur, on Wednesday. According to the press release issued by LAAC, the train departed from Ahmedabad at 8pm with a stoppage in Surat at around 11.30 pm. It is expected to arrive at Ranchi in Jharkhand on Thursday. The student body, which works for various socio-legal issues has undertaken initiatives to spread legal awareness among the less privileged and is currently trying to address the concerns of migrant workers who have been hit by the national lockdown and economic downturn.The LAAC took the help of a Non-Governmental Organisation(NGO), Prayas Center for Labour Research and Action, to gather contact details of the migrant labourers. They traced their locations and conducted telephonic interviews to understand their needs and prepared a database of such labourers. More than 19,000 such workers were contacted, of which, many of them had already reached their native state.The committee then gathered and collated Aadhaar details of those labourers who wished to take a Shramik train back home.An application to allow an urgent the special train to transport 1,650 workers was made last week before the district magistrates of Ahmedabad and Surat. The request was sanctioned on June 9.“It is a long way to go. Many of these people are facing resource and cash crunch and are without work and we are exploring ways to alleviate those issues. But this is a good start”, convenor of LAAC, Jayati Garg told HT.The alumni from the National Law School of India University, Bengaluru, had also accomplished a similar task in May when they raised over Rs 12 lakh to lease an aircraft and fly 180 migrant workers from Mumbai to Ranchi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nlu-arranges-train-to-ferry-over-1-600-migrants-home/story-Hxp60aRiK0baMA26AG0P7M.html
11-06-2020||India||Political workers in J-K face fear, uncertainty following sarpanch’s murder||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) general secretary and in-charge of Jammu and Kashmir, Ram Madhav on Wednesday said the killing of Ajay Pandita alias Bharti, a Kashmiri Pandit Sarpanch in South Kashmir on Monday is an attempt by terrorists to create divisions between communities in the Valley.Political workers across party lines, however, renewed their demand that the Union government should meet its assurance of providing panchayat members in Jammu and Kashmir security and insurance.Madhav blamed Pakistan for Bharti’s murder.“This is a heinous crime by the perpetrators of terror who out of their frustration are targeting innocent civilians. Unfortunately, every time they cannot face the law and order machinery, they turn to the minorities. This is the real face of Pakistan; in their own country they have gone after Hindus in Punjab and now are employing similar tactics in Kashmir as well,” he said.There has been widespread anger among political workers in Kashmir over the killing of Bharti, the sarpanch of Lukbawan village in south Kashmir’s Larkipora area who was shot dead by unidentified terrorists. Local media reports suggest he had been seeking security in the wake of threats.While many political workers from across parties said the government has not met their demand for security, Madhav said, the state administration has provided security facilities for the local body representatives who are about 40,000 in number. “They are given safe accommodation in Srinagar, but despite that, such incidents have occurred,” he said.Nazir Ahmad Laway, a member of the Rajya Sabha said, while sitting MPs and ministers are provided security cover, former MPs, ministers and political workers find themselves in vulnerable situations as they become “easy targets” for terror groups. “They cannot even move freely in their own area,” Laway said.In September last year, during a meeting with panchayat members from the erstwhile state, Union home minister Amit Shah had said every panch and sarpanch in Jammu and Kashmir will be given police security and insurance cover of Rs 2 lakh, which would later be revised.He had also assured the delegation that the demand for increasing their honorarium will be considered and internet and telecommunication networks will be strengthened.“Since the year 2012 when the targeted killing of sarpanches began, we have been petitioning the Centre and the state governments to provide security and safe accommodation. In all these years starting with the Congress-led UPA government and now the BJP-led NDA government at the centre our demands have not been met. The administration has reduced us to fodder, giving us no respect and no share in power,” complained Shafiq Mir, president of the All Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat Conference.Mir said in the absence of security, 19 sarpanches have lost their lives since 2012.He also pointed out that in the absence of political representatives, since the J&K assembly has been dissolved, it is the panchyats that are the bridge between the people and the government.Demanding Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s intervention, Mir said, “It was on his assurance that we participated in the panchayat elections in 2018. At that time the mainstream political parties in the (then) state had refused to be part of the political process. On December 19, 2018 we met the PM as a 48-member delegation. We later met the home minister too to push for our demands”. Mir Junaid, president of the newly formed Jammu and Kashmir Workers Party who was part of the delegation that met Shah in September after the bifurcation of the state into two union territories said the panchayat workers have been questioning the government’s delay.“They are also asking questions about why the government expects people to be part of the democratic process if they still have not fulfilled their promises,” Junaid said.He said the panchayat members were assured that Rs 3,500 crore will be transferred directly into the accounts of gram panchayats, provided safe accommodation at district headquarters and offered insurance between Rs 2-4 lakh per head.“Since Monday, we have not even heard of any compensation offered to Bharti’s family,” Junaid said.Jammu and Kashmir administration officials did not respond to questions on why the insurance scheme has not been implemented yet.Sushobha Barve, executive secretary of the Centre for Dialogue and Reconciliation said the political ecosystem of Kashmir which has deteriorated since August 5, 2019 when Article 370 scrapped, has made the Sarpanches and Panchayat members soft targets.“There is a lot of concern in Kashmir that while the political economic system has not improved and in the middle of a pandemic, the government is focusing on planning the Amarnath Yatra,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/political-workers-in-j-k-face-fear-uncertainty-following-sarpanch-s-murder/story-UJH8xxxp9WRxb3KfVk50FL.html
11-06-2020||India||Loss of smell, taste may be added to Covid-19 test criteria||The government is considering expanding the eligibility criteria for Covid-19 testing to include loss of smell and taste and the matter was discussed by the national task force constituted to fight the outbreak, said two members of the panel on Wednesday. The issue was brought up in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-constituted national task force on Covid-related matters because several cases have been reported where the patients showed a loss of smell or taste. “This was in discussion as there were some people of the opinion that this could be looked at, too. However, no decision has been taken over it yet,” said a member who did not wish to be identified.The first set of criteria for Covid testing was fixed in January and comprised fever, cough, and breathlessness as symptoms. Later, in May, gastrointestinal issues such as diarrhoea or vomiting were also added.There are currently 13 clinical symptoms and signs in the specimen referral form that was revised last month. The symptoms are fever, cough, diarrhoea, vomiting, abdominal pain, breathlessness, nausea, haemoptysis (coughing up of blood), body ache, sore throat, chest pain, nasal discharge and sputum. Any patient with one or more symptoms are allowed to get tested for Covid-19. If loss of taste and smell are added to the list, a patient would have to report one or more of 15 symptoms to get tested.The national task force members go through latest clinical data available around the world, and in India, to update the testing criteria.In April, the World Health Organization (WHO), along with many European Union (EU) countries, the USA, and Australia, added loss of smell and taste as one of the key Covid-19 symptoms. The United Kingdom also added these to its list of Covid-19 symptom on May 18.An article published in the medical journal Lancet last week titled “Quantifying Additional Covid-19 Symptoms Will Save Lives” mentioned that in many countries, regular mass swab testing was still inadequate. “To reduce the number of infectious people in the community, it is therefore crucial to use the symptom combinations that can identify them,” the researchers said.“Using self-reported symptoms data from 18 401 users of the COVID Symptom Study app, who underwent an official SARS-CoV-2 test (7104 testing positive, 11 297 testing negative)… The prevalence of loss of smell and taste was three-fold higher in individuals testing positive (65·03%) than in those testing negative (21·71%),2 suggesting that people with loss of smell and taste should self-isolate.”Doctors treating Covid-19 patients in India say that expanding the eligibility criteria will help in identifying cases.“There is a percentage of Covid positive people who do report with symptoms wherein they have lost their sense of smell and taste even though the number does not seem too big when compared with people who report with fever, sore throat and cough. However, we do see Covid patients with these symptoms so it’s not a bad idea to include this in the list of criteria for Covid testing,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care department, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram.Some other experts argued that the eligibility criteria for testing should be expanded further. “Apart from loss of smell and taste, I think, weakness, muscle pain and chills should also be added into the eligibility list as these are also listed as clinical signs of Covid patients,” says Dr Giridhara Babu, head, life course epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loss-of-smell-taste-may-be-added-to-covid-test-criteria/story-w5AUlKnq67oNBi9HkiVQYI.html
11-06-2020||India||Community transmission of Covid-19 for Centre to declare: Delhi health minister||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a statement on Wednesday reiterated that there was transmission in the community in Delhi, but it was up to the central government to declare “community transmission”. After a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority a day ago, the minister had said that the government was unable to establish the source of infection in 50% of the cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the city.“There is transmission in the community, but whether it is community transmission or not that can be declared only by the Centre. It is a technical term,” said Jain. Union health secretary Preeti Sudan refused to respond on the matter.Delhi has recorded 32,810 cases of Covid-19 and 984 deaths due to the infection till Wednesday, according to data provided by the Delhi government. With the rising number of cases in the city, the health minister also said that it was difficult to trace all contacts of the laboratory-confirmed cases.“Earlier, in one case contact tracing would be done up to 600 people. Today, if we multiply 1,500 cases into 600 it gives us 900,000 people for contact tracing. So, contact tracing is being done only for immediate contacts and not for indirect contacts,” the minister said.The high number of cases in cities such as Delhi and Mumbai is indicative of community transmission, say experts. “Although, ICMR has not published the report of their serology test, a high positivity has been reported among random samples. That is not possible without community transmission. And, the virus is going to spread further, the only positive thing is we will also develop herd immunity sooner. In the meanwhile, the situation is grim for the elderly and those with co-morbidities. All the government can do is streamline the health care services so that those in need can access it without hassle,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.The Delhi government also blamed the Centre for using the city’s airports to bring in people from other countries. “Delhi and Mumbai are the two cities where people were brought in from other nations via flights, and we warned the Centre against it but they did nothing to avoid the landing of flights in Delhi,” said Jain.The minister also said that another lockdown would not help in curtailing the spread of the viral infection. “When the lockdown was imposed, there were 100 cases across the country and now that number has gone up to thousands. If we impose lockdown again, there will be no logic as the cases will increase from around 2.5 lakh to 25 lakh despite the lockdown,” he said.Amit Singh, associate professor at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru said, “We went into a lockdown a little early and even the relaxation of restrictions happened a little early. Other countries lifted their lockdown when their curve had started to come down, but we did it when the curve is going up exponentially. It was not well-timed. However, economic considerations have to be kept in mind. The only strategy that the government can now adopt is aggressively test and isolate those with the infection or close areas where they think the infection is circulating in the community.”The Delhi government had on June 2 restricted its testing criteria excluding asymptomatic contacts who weren’t old or have known co-morbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, or cancer. The Lieutenant Governor on Monday reversed the decision.The health minister also said that the Delhi government had to be prepared as none of the predictions were coming true, such as people believing that the spread of Covid-19 would come down when the temperature increased.“Epidemiologically, seasonality does not play a role when there is an epidemic because there is a high pool of susceptible people. This was also seen during the H1N1 pandemic, when for two years the seasonality had changed completely before the infection becoming endemic and starting to follow the pattern. The same is likely to happen with Covid-19,” said Dr Broor.The health minister said the government was working towards arranging twice the number of beds than patients in the hospitals. “By June 15, around 7,000 beds will be occupied and by June 30, 15,000. We are preparing for the foreseeable situation of June 30, and for that, we are making preparations of the Covid infrastructure in stadiums, banquet halls, and hotels,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/community-transmission-has-begun-but-up-to-centre-to-declare-satyendar-jain/story-GPOYz6P2CFECADgfbbjmEO.html
11-06-2020||India||Congress, BJP spar over CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s clips||The Madhya Pradesh Congress released audio and video clips on Wednesday, saying they contained chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s speech in which he admitted the previous state government was toppled on the instructions of the central BJP leadership.Chouhan’s remarks cited by the Congress purportedly came while addressing an intraparty meeting with BJP workers and leaders in Indore on Sunday. In the speech, Chouhan is heard saying, “But there is a question. The central leadership had decided that this government should fall. This (government) will ruin and destroy the state.”HT can’t vouch for the authenticity of the clips. Chouhan is further heard saying while pointing to his ministerial colleague Tulsi Silavat, who resigned from the Congress to join the BJP, “ He (Tulsi Silavat) gave up his position of minister as he was pained (with the conduct of the Congress). People don’t give up even the post of sarpanch.”Chouhan’s meeting with the party workers and leaders was to mobilise them ahead of bypolls to 24 assembly constituencies, 22 of which fell vacant after the then Congress MLAs, including six ministers representing these seats in the state assembly resigned from the state assembly in March and later join the BJP. Silavat, who is water resources minister in the Chouhan cabinet, is likely to contest the bypoll from Sanwer assembly seat that he held until he resigned.The resignations of the legislators followed the resignation of senior Congress leader Jyotiraditya Scindia who joined the BJP. Their resignations culminated in the fall of the Congress government in the state. State Congress president and former chief minister Kamal Nath said, “I have been saying from day one that BJP toppled my government which had the mandate from people, under a conspiracy while playing the game of enticement. It was because the government was waiving loans of farmers, giving employment to youth, protecting dignity of women, running a campaign against mafia and bringing investment to the state. BJP knew that with such work of the the Congress government, it would not be able to return to power for years.”Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan could not be reached for comment.The state BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal said, “What the chief minister said was in agreement with what he said earlier too that the government didn’t fall because of the BJP but because of inherent conflicts within the Congress. It is a fact that the government fell due to resignation of 22 Congress MLAs. The BJP did its duty later to form the government.”The state Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “In view of chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s admission regarding the conspiracy against the then Congress government the party will take necessary steps after consulting legal experts.”In the audio clip, reminding the party workers and leaders of their duties with regard to the bypolls, Chouhan is heard saying, “Election is going to take place. Tell me with honesty if Tulsi Silavat doesn’t become an MLA will I remain a chief minister? Will BJP government be saved? That’s why it’s our duty that Tulsi Silavat has to win from Sanwer and BJP has to win this seat...”To motivate workers Chouhan is heard saying, “Tulsi Silavat is just a symbol. Barely is there an occasion when a mother asks her son to protect her honour. BJP is our mother politically and this mother is asking us to protect her honour lest it should face defeat and the lotus flower (BJP’s symbol) is let down and the PM’s decision is proved wrong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-bjp-spar-over-cm-chouhan-s-clips/story-D5ARvkTdImUqINA0u6uCmL.html
11-06-2020||India||WeTransfer banned in public interest: Official||File-sharing website WeTransfer has been blocked for Indian internet users “in public interest as it was being misused”, a department of telecommunications (DoT) official said, amid mounting criticism that the government was censoring access to internet without adequate justification.WeTransfer was blocked through an order on May 18, which cited “interest of national security or public interest” as justification for the ban without giving more details. It is now among 4,000-odd websites, which includes pornography sites, that are inaccessible for Indians. “We get regular requests from the home ministry, ministry of electronics and information technology or even courts to block certain websites,” said an official in DoT, who asked not to be named. “WeTransfer was blocked as it was misused by some people to share content in the name of Delhi Police Commissioner and other government officials. The request came to us from the Delhi Police cybercrime unit. It’s a matter of national security,” this person added.A senior official in the Delhi Police’s cybercrime unit, when asked about WeTransfer, said he was not aware of a specific abuse case, although, this person added, generic alerts had been sent to the home ministry. Since the order was issued, several social media users have highlighted the ban, including film editor TS Suresh. The website has in the past been used by the government, with links to WeTransfer files on the Press Information Bureau (PIB) website.HT could access WeTransfer on some internet service providers. “We will write to the ministry to approach internet service providers to comply with the order,” the official quoted above said when asked about the ban not being enforced.Digital rights groups said the ban reflects a lack of transparency. “Today, we sent a representation to DoT urging them to recall this direction,” the Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) said in a statement on Tuesday. “We further also indicate the need for wider regulatory reforms that have led to questionable blocking orders in the past. Including the blocking of Telegram and Porn Websites in India. This is at its very threshold, a transparency problem.”According to IFF trustee Apar Gupta, the lack of reasoning in the order denies WeTransfer a chance to defend its position. “If that’s the basis, then it needs to be mentioned in the order,” Gupta said. “That way WeTransfer can defend itself and it breeds accountability for a large number of users who subscribe to the service for legitimate reasons.” Moreover, added Gupta, clarifying the position would also enable law enforcement to track those responsible for misusing the service. “Under the Information Technology Act, WeTransfer is not liable for malicious content as it acts as an intermediary,” said Gupta. “By mentioning the reason in the order, the government would also have given WeTransfer the chance to expeditiously take down the content”.“Irrespective of the legitimacy of the demand, the process was deeply flawed. This sets a bad precedent,” Gupta added.According to the DoT official quoted above, lack of transparency cannot be used to “downplay” the need to block WeTransfer. “It was done in public interest. People should understand that we received a genuine request, assessed it and decided it was best to block the website.”(With inputs from Prawesh Lama)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wetransfer-banned-in-public-interest-official/story-hEsox3j5eHscd7LHLB3PVP.html
11-06-2020||India||Amrapali buyers get top court relief||In one stroke, the Supreme Court on Wednesday paved the way for the infusion of at least Rs 2,000 crore for the construction of stalled Amrapali Group housing projects. Two key directions passed by a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and UU Lalit made the cash infusion possible.The first direction was to banks to release the balance of loan amounts sanctioned to Amrapali homebuyers. This direction alone has the potential of arranging funds worth over Rs. 3,000 crore.According to a note prepared by the court-appointed receiver and senior advocate R Venkatramani, assisting the court in the execution of these projects, under the head “bank loans to homebu interestyers and balance receivables from all sold units (of Amrapali projects)” a total amount of Rs 3,870.4 crore is due.Even those homebuyers who failed to make timely deposits due to which their loan accounts were declared NPA or non-performing assets will also benefit from this order. The court said, “We direct the banks and financial institutions to release loans to home buyers, whose loans have been sanctioned, notwithstanding the fact that their accounts are declared as NPAs. This we order in the peculiar facts of the case.”The court further directed the banks to restructure the loans in a manner to ensure money is released upon stage-wise completion of projects. This way, the projects will stand completed and homebuyers will be in a position to repay the loans at interest rates fixed by the Reserve Bank of India.The court expressed its concern by saying, “The home buyers are not able to obtain fruits of the investment and are deprived of legal title of the flats.”The second key direction from the court came with regard to sale of unused floor area ratio (FAR) available under the sanctioned plan for Amrapali projects. In addition, Venkatramani’s note made a mention of land available under permissible FAR and balance FAR, in addition to unused FAR to be sold to prospective developers. This was objected to by the Noida and Greater Noida authorities who sought return of the balance FAR.The unused FAR with Noida Authority comprised of 35,798.19 square meters of land while the Greater Noida Authority staked claim over FAR on unconstructed plots at Plot No.GH 09, Sector Tech. Zone 4, Greater Noida.Accepting the receiver’s suggestions, the court said, “A substantial amount has to be fetched out of the sale of permissible FAR, as the case may be, and due to other developments, if any other FAR is made available, it is permitted to be sold by the Receiver and the Committee to utilize the money to complete various projects.”Venkatramani said, “With today’s directions, homebuyers can heave a sigh of relief. With the sale of FAR, we roughly expect anything between Rs 500-800 crore. And if the loans are released, even by a conservative estimate (after deducting people who wish to opt out of the project) we can receive at least Rs 2,000 crore. Few more milestones are to be crossed before the projects finally lift off.”The Court directed the Noida, Greater Noida authorities to grant sanction of the plans and designs submitted by the prospective developers within 30 days of its submission. They were further directed to supply water, electricity, sewerage to the projects built on these sites after receiving the amount due to them after sale of FAR.For the homebuyers, advocate ML Lahoty said, “The court has resolved that NPA will no more be an impediment in releasing loans. This is a significant order as several homebuyers were not in a position to pay.”In addition to relief to homebuyers, the court also ordered relief to builders/developers who were exempted from paying exorbitant interest of 15-23% to Noida/Greater Noida authorities on plots allotted between 2005 till date and where construction was incomplete. The court reduced the interest to a flat 8% on the condition that the amount is paid and construction completed within stipulated time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amrapali-buyers-get-top-court-relief/story-rPHmge29INMhkTvpIRvAKK.html
11-06-2020||India||Delhi firm ties up with US company to work on Covid-19 vaccine candidate||New Delhi-based biotechnology company Panacea Biotec Limited has partnered with US-based Refana Inc in the development, manufacturing and distribution of an experimental coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine.Panacea Biotec is working on product development and commercial manufacturing of an inactivated whole virus vaccine against Sars-CoV2, the virus that causes Covid-19.An inactivated whole virus vaccine uses a weakened or inactivated virus to trigger a lasting immune response against the infecting pathogen. It is a tried and tested platform, and examples of such vaccines include polio vaccine, smallpox vaccine, rotavius vaccine against diarrhoea, and rabies vaccine, among others.It’s a tried and tested vaccine platform, and many existing vaccines, such as those for measles and polio, are made in this way.The firm will produce at least 500 million doses of the experimental vaccine, of which 40 to 45 million doses will be ready by January next year.“We have completed proof of concept studies in the US and the results suggest a possible broader neutralising ability against the Sars-CoV-2 virus strain, which means that even if the virus mutates in future, the vaccine will be effective,” said Rajesh Jain, managing director, Panacea Biotec.“Over the next four weeks, we are going to develop this vaccine in our labs in Delhi and Punjab and after regulatory toxicology studies and animal pre-clinical studies, we hope to start the phase one human trials by October. By August, we will start the cGMP (current good manufacturing practices) process so that we can start trials in October and thereafter, scale up for Phase 3 trials,” said Jain, who announced the collaboration with Refana Inc on Wednesday.Refana Inc is a US-registered private corporation led by Dr Phillip Schwartz, who is its chief scientific and medical adviser, and also the founder and president of NASDAQ-listed EnteraBio, according to Panacea Biotec.“Trials can happen in any country, today is day zero, we haven’t decided whether it will be in the US and India. By December-January next year, our target is to produce approximately 40-45 million doses and by that time, the phase one results will be out,” he said.The vaccine maker launched the world’s first fully liquid hexavalent vaccine in 2017 called EasySix , which is a six-in-one shot that protects against diptheria, tetanus, pertussis, hepatitis B, haemophilus influenzae type b, and polio. It is also developing a new tetravalent dengue vaccine that works against all four strains of dengue virus, and pneumococcal conjugate vaccine against childhood pneumonia, among others.Panacea Biotec is the fifth biotech company from India to join global efforts on the development of a vaccine against Covid-19. There are at least 130 vaccines in various stages of development, of which 10 are in advanced stages of development, according to data from the World Health Organisation. Of the 10 vaccines, four are inactivated vaccines, all of which are being developed in China.“Whole inactivated viral vaccines have a higher probability of being safe and efficacious, given their long history and better understanding of their mechanism of action. The intramuscular/sub-cutaneous (injected in the fatty tissue under the skin, instead of a vein) mode of administration makes it easy to use and this vaccine has the potential to become the vaccine of choice for the global fight against Covid-19,” said Jain.“We have a propriety product to inactivate the whole virus and our formulation also carries a propriety adjuvant to address safety issues. Multiple doses will be needed because we are using the whole virus, which has the ability to prevent infection over time. For that to happen, we need to maintain immunogenicity (ability to provide immune response) at a particular level,” said Jain.“Adjuvants, which are substances that enhance the body’s immune response to an invading pathogen, and make lower doses viable, which make them safe without compromising protection. At least a dozen groups are working on adjuvanted vaccines against Covid-19 globally, and some have committed to making licensed adjuvants available for use with novel Covid-19 vaccines developed by others,” said Dr Nirmal K Ganguly, former director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research.Since it’s a tried and tested vaccine platform, scalability is not an issue, and neither is transportation and distribution as the vaccine can be stored at 2-8 degrees Celsius, according to Jain.After the announcement, the price of Panacea Biotech shares jumped 20% in morning trading on India’s National Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning. Hyderabad-based vaccine maker Bharat Biotech has three vaccine candidates using two different platforms in the works, including one that uses an existing nasal flu vaccine, and two that use the deactivated rabies vaccine to deliver the Sars-CoV2 genetic material into the body to induce it to produce an immune response.University of Oxford and AstraZeneca’s adenovirus vaccine is in late-stage trials. Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, has invested $100 million in a manufacturing facility and is production in two months following its tie-up with UK-based AstraZeneca to mass produce the University of Oxford vaccine for India and other low-and-middle-income countries. “Till the trials are completed successfully for safety and efficacy, vaccines will not be distributed either in India or anywhere else in the world,” Adar Poonawalla, CEO, Serum Institute of India, said on Tuesday.SII also partnered with US biotech firm Codagenix for a vaccine using a weakened virus that doesn’t cause disease, but triggers an immune response, and with Austrian biotech company, Themis Bioscience, for a vaccine that uses the measles virus as a vector to inject an antigen or protein of SARS-CoV-2.Zydus Cadila in Ahmedabad and India Immunologicals in Hyderabad have also entered partnerships to develop Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-firm-ties-up-with-us-company-to-work-on-vaccine-candidate/story-33ahpQc9MViJYD0QOEXT3L.html

Speaking at a media conference in Bengaluru, DK Shivakumar, the new state Congress president, said that they had taken a verbal approval of the police commissioner for the event which was planned for June 14.“Earlier, it had been postponed twice on May 31 and June 7. We had reserved 7,800 different locations across the state apart from 3,500 other places for Congress workers to participate in the ‘Pratijna Dina’ (oath day). Despite clearly saying that only 150 people will assemble in the KPCC office itself, permission has been denied. I am surprised at the vendetta politics unleashed by CM Yediyurappa,” said Shivakumar.The Congress high command had named Shivakumar as the new chief of the Karnataka unit on March 11 after incumbent Dinesh Gundu Rao resigned in December 2019 taking moral responsibility for the poor show in by-elections. Since then, the Congress has been trying to hold an event for Shivakumar.Pointing out that BJP leaders in the state were participating in events where thousands have participated, Shivakumar questioned why there was no action against them and accused the government of double standards towards the opposition. “BJP leaders in West Bengal and Bihar were holding mega rallies and is the law different for different political parties?” Shivakumar said.Underscoring that he would continue to tour the state and meet people, Shivakumar said his party would explore the legal options available to hold the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-karnataka-congress-to-approach-court-over-dk-shivakumar-s-swearing-in/story-W65F9K59UI4ukFFYozL8AN.html
11-06-2020||India||Four weeks needed to restore Assam gas well leak; locals fear impact on biodiversity||Oil India Limited’s (OIL) gas well blowout in Upper Assam’s Tinsukia district that caught fire on Tuesday afternoon will take around four weeks to be completely restored, according to OIL authorities.On Tuesday, OIL authorities said that the well caught fire while clearing operations were being carried out at the site. “No casualty has been reported. Fire tenders are at the site controlling the spread of fire…there’re violent protests around the well site,” the statement said.OIL has made a request to the chief secretary, Assam, and Tinsukia district administration for maintaining law and order at the site.All OIL and Oil & Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) officials have been evacuated from nearby areas.Experts from Singapore-based Alert Disaster Control, who are currently on a visit to the site, and OIL, ONGC employees will return to the spot after the situation is brought under control.“The situation demands the arrangement of large quantities of water, installation of high discharge pumps, and removal of debris. All the operations as per the Acute Launch Emergency Reliability Tip (ALERT) will take about four weeks,” the statement added. Baghjan, where the gas well blowout took place on May 27 and has been continuously leaking condensed oil and gas, is located adjacent to Dibru Saikhowa National Park; Maguri-Motapung wetlands and forest villages of Barekuri -- a habitat to the endangered Hoolock Gibbon.“We’ve written a letter to the Assam forest department for a report on the situation. Besides, we’ve asked a team from the Wildlife Institute of India, which is posted there for some other projects, to make an assessment and give us a report. The cause of concern is that the gas well is still leaking,” said Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director-general (wildlife), Union Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change (MoEFCC).“The Chief Wildlife Warden Assam, MK Yadava, is slated to visit the spot. We’re awaiting his briefing,” said Sanjay Kumar, director-general (forests), MoEFCC.Local wildlife activists said the biodiversity of the region might be lost, as condensed oil had leaked into several important sites of the landscape.“We’ve seen dead birds on Wednesday morning. A flying squirrel was also found dead. On Tuesday, a Great Pied Hornbill was rescued from the blowout site. The impact on wildlife could be massive,” said Rofikul Islam, a naturalist, who visits the place regularly.“At least 50-60 houses are gutted. Angry villagers are protesting against the OIL authorities. They’ve also fought with some fire control personnel. There is a massive impact on the fragile ecology of the region. The fire has unlikely to have entered Dibru Saikhowa National Park, even though it’s located close to the site. But the village, the grasslands that were already soaked in condensed oil from the blowout and continuous oil leak since May 27 have all caught fire. The impact on wildlife is yet to be assessed because of the raging fire. This is tragic,” said Mridupaban Phukon, a Tinsukia-based student and wildlife activist,“Environmental clearances are often given on the premise that environmental damage will not happen, or if it does happen, it will be mitigated. This spill shows us how there’s little ability to mitigate. The area is part of a biodiversity hotspot and is recorded range of some of India’s most restricted range and endangered birds, such as the White-winged wood duck, the Bengal Florican, and White-bellied heron. The heron is now found mostly in Bhutan, with less than 10 seen in India. These three are the kind of species that have historically been rare. It’s a shame to endanger the few places left on earth for them. We can hardly quantify the damage of an oil spill for aquatic species that live underwater,” said Neha Sinha, a conservation biologist.According to a 2013 site inspection report, regarding oil and gas pipelines in Upper Assam by conservation scientists and former members of National Board for Wildlife, MD Madhusudan and Prerna Singh Bindra, the Dibru-Saikhowa National Park and Biosphere Reserve meet at the confluence of the Brahmaputra with three of the country’s easternmost rivers — the Siang, Dibang and Lohit.The park shaped by these rivers is spread over 765 square kilometres (sq km), of which 340 sq km form the core and comprise wetlands, alluvial grasslands, riverine forests, swamps, and semi-evergreen forests, including the largest willow swamp forest in north-east India.Dibru-Saikhowa has recorded over 40 mammals, 500 species of birds, 104 fish species, 105 butterfly species, and 680 types of plants. It harbours the tiger, elephant, wild buffalo, leopard, hoolock gibbon, capped langur, slow loris, Gangetic dolphin, besides critically endangered bird species such as the Bengal Florican, White Winged Duck, Greater 8 Adjutant stork, White-rumped vulture, slender-billed vulture as well as the very rare and endemic Black-breasted parrotbill.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-s-gas-well-leak-will-take-4-weeks-to-be-restored-biodiversity-impact-massive-say-locals/story-QcEp1r1sWbbDbtfS4GwG8I.html
11-06-2020||India||Centre tells states to focus on optimal equipment use, tracing as Covid-19 cases rise||Optimal use of hospital beds, ambulances and ventilators and a more aggressive approach towards contact tracing are the need of the hour, the Centre has told the states, as the number of Covid-19 positive cases jumped to 267,000 on Tuesday, officials aware of the situation said.According to officials involved in the Centre-state discussions, who spoke on condition of anonymity, central ministries and the cabinet secretariat are in touch with state governments on a daily basis, closely monitoring the emerging situation and providing actionable inputs to the states.During recent interactions, the Centre asked states to sharpen their focus on optimal use of hospital beds because the cases are sharply rising in some parts of the country compared to the availability of beds “There will be rising demand for hospital beds with the rise in number of cases. Some states have a policy to keep people with mild symptoms quarantined at home. We are further underlining that hospital beds, ambulance services and ventilators have to be judiciously used,” said one of the officials cited above.Hospital beds, ambulances and ventilators, according to the official, are also critical to keep the death rate low. “In other words, these critical services should be available in emergency cases. “Earlier, we got reports that some private hospitals in a few states are using ventilators not so judiciously. We asked the states concerned to look into the issue,” the official added.The gradual opening up of the economy and the movement of migrant workers are the key reasons for the rise in the number of Covid-19 case, according to an internal assessment by the Union government.But the officials cited said the revival of the economy and return of workers stranded by the lockdown to their states were also“absolutely essential”.One official also added that as of now there is no major change in the government’s strategy of fighting Covid-19 and the states had been asked to do “more of the same”, or rigorously follow existing guidelines to prevent the spread of the outbreak.The Centre has also asked states to focus more on house-to-house surveys for active cases and contact tracing for identifying Covid-19 cases, especially in congested urban areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-tells-states-to-focus-on-optimal-equipment-use-tracing/story-eRZC2b50su8b8mI8CSku9O.html

Samples from states such as West Bengal and Jammu and Kashmir are yet to be tested. However, whatever has been seen so far is not alarming; it would have been a cause for concern if there were antibodies seen in a significant number of persons residing in areas where there were no cases or very low prevalence of Covid. Fortunately, no such trend has so far been observed,” one of the government officials added. He did not deny reports of 15-30% exposure in containment zones (which basically means the tests showed that 15-30% of the people in these zones had antibodies to the coronavirus disease) but added that the final picture would emerge only after “ ICMR tests and analyses all samples.” That’s still happening said the ICMR spokesperson. “Experts in our Chennai lab are still analysing the data, and the results have not been finalized yet. It’s too early to predict a nation-wide trend conclusively. We go by evidence and not speculation,” said Dr Rajnikant Srivastava, spokesperson, ICMR.For the survey 24,000 blood samples were collected from 69 districts in 21 states last month.Additionally, about 5,000 samples were specifically picked from 10 cities with a lot of cases: Mumbai, Delhi, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Thane, Pune, Indore, Kolkata, Hyderabad, and Aurangabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-zones-largely-unaffected-reveal-initial-findings-of-survey/story-OzqaBcCTURJr8gtQtbGIuO.html

11-06-2020||India||The power of social media: Strangers across India connect to help the needy||With the nationwide lockdown imposed in India due to the coronavirus outbreak, the families of daily wage earners, labourers, waiters, taxi and autorickshaw drivers, and others who depend on their everyday earnings for survival have been severely affected.In the corona stricken world, social media is helping people come together to reach out to various organizations pan India and even establish new ones to feed the hungry.Caring Indians, a crowdsourced social initiative has been providing food, PPE kits and masks to residents of Mumbai and Pune. Samarth Sharma of Caring Indians, says, “The need of the hour is to help people. With a significant social media base, my friends and I thought of this initiative.”Sharma, an IIT alumnus, says, “With the lockdown in place, people have been spending a lot of time on social media. Our initiative has been possible only because of social media and my loyal fan base that helped me with spreading the message. Social media in such times has emerged as a big influencer in itself. We managed to feed 35,000 people in a week.” Venapani Seksaria, founder, Shakkar Paara project who has been carrying out relief missions across India, says, “There are people who I haven’t ever met in my life and yet we have become a big family and have forged an unbreakable bond through social media.”Venapani says, “ The Shakkar Paara was an emergency ration project started by the army and i had heard many stories around it during the Kargil war. That inspired the idea behind my project , to distribute shakkar paaras to the hungry, to help them experience satiety and sustain energy. It evolved over time because of feedback from ground, to supply groceries and toiletries to the affected communities. However I retained the name of there project as it’s sweet, comforting and energy giving in these times.”She adds, “Whether social media or word of mouth, it’s transparency and accountability that draws people to contribute to such causes. With people coming out and helping, both financially or on ground, it makes us realise that at least our hearts are in the right place.”Through her project, Venapani wants to feed everyone who is hungry, whether it’s the daily wage workers, labourers, auto-rickshaw pullers or bar dancers in Mumbai. She adds, “We are also distributing groceries and toiletries to all people impacted by the pandemic.”Many NGO’s and self-help groups have used social media to share images of the happy faces, letting people know how even the smallest donations have put a smile on someone’s face. One such group is Roti Bank. Sudhir Behrani, founder, says, “Social media has played a vital role in garnering support for the cause of these migrant workers and daily wage labourers. As ration involves a lot of logistics, we stick to cooked food. The happiness you get by seeing people come together for a noble cause is a different feeling altogether.”Jan Jagriti Foundation has also been helping people with dry ration. Nutan from the foundation says, “Indians are always willing to help. One post from a social media account for help and you have hundreds of people willing to come forward and help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-power-of-social-media-strangers-across-india-connect-to-help-the-needy/story-4SJE2A2j2tCavGD0obMrxM.html
