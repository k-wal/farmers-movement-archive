Some of them are from nearby fault lines as well,” he said. The 5.3-magnitude earthquake occurred on south Wagad fault, which is a system of faults with many branches. When a moderate intensity quake occurs, it disturbs the nearby branches, Chopra said.“So, when this moderate intensity shock occurred, it disturbed nearby connected faults and passed on the energy to them,” he said. The quakes with intensities of 4.6 and 4.1 magnitude that occurred on Monday were on the branches of the main south Waghad fault, and were technically separate earthquakes, the official said.According to the ISR, an earthquake of 4.6 magnitude occurred at 12.57 pm on Monday with its epicentre 15 km north-northeast from Bhachau in Kutch and this was followed by a quake of 4.1 magnitude at 3.56 pm at six km north-northwest of Bhachau.The combined aftershocks of these three earthquakes stand at 17 so far, the official said.The 5.3 magnitude earthquake recorded at 8.13 pm Sunday night shook Kutch and parts of Gujarat including Rajkot and Patan.According to the Kutch district administration, no casualties or major damage to properties were reported in any of these earthquakes.Kutch district is located in a “very high risk” seismic zone, and earthquakes of lower intensity occur regularly there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/18-aftershocks-and-2-quakes-rattle-gujarat-s-kutch-since-sunday/story-oxUAvJsL7vETNc4urWfN7O.html
16-06-2020||India||BJP, Congress accuse Odisha govt of scaling down Covid-19 tests||As Covid-19 cases surged past 4,100 in Odisha, opposition BJP and Congress on Tuesday accused the Naveen Patnaik government of scaling down testing for Covid-19.BJP state general secretary Golak Mahapatra alleged that while chief minister Patnaik last month had announced conducting 15,000 tests daily in June, the number of tests have now gone below 3,000 over the last few weeks. “On June 15, a total of 2,988 tests were conducted, on June 14 the number of tests were 2,499. The number of tests is going down over the weeks,” alleged Mohapatra. He also demanded that all inmates of quarantine centres across the state should undergo Covid-19 tests.On the other hand, neighbouring Andhra Pradesh is testing 15,000 people daily and has so far tested five lakh people.Congress MLA Suresh Kumar Routray also criticized the government for testing only two lakh people while over five lakh migrants have returned to the state. “From 5,000 tests a day in May, it is inexplicable how the number of tests came down drastically,” he said, alleging that the government has failed the migrants by not providing adequate testing facilities.Reacting to Mahapatra’s charges, BJD spokesperson Dr Sasmit Patra said the BJP and Congress should not play politics in the times of pandemic. “Odisha is conducting Covid testing of all symptomatic persons as per the ICMR guidelines. Though testing capacity has been increased to 15,000 per day Odisha is carrying out the tests as per ICMR and Government of India guidelines. The same testing process is also being followed by BJP and Congress-ruled states across the country,” said Patra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-congress-accuse-odisha-govt-of-scaling-down-covid-19-tests/story-opQQXP7bYzwwk9H02jdLPP.html
16-06-2020||India||In Andhra Pradesh’s budget of Rs 2.24 lakh cr, a revenue deficit of Rs 18K cr||Andhra Pradesh finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy on Tuesday presented the budget for 2020-21 in the state assembly with an outlay of Rs 2.24 lakh crore and a revenue deficit of Rs 18,434 crore.The budget was scheduled to be presented in the last week of March but was delayed because of the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19.As a result, the state government had to promulgate an ordinance on March 30 to draw around Rs 70,000 crore from the state consolidated fund for the first three months of the financial year commencing on April 1.As the two-day budget session of the state assembly commenced on Tuesday, the finance minister presented the full-fledged budget for the 2020-21 fiscal, which included the amount drawn for the first three months.Out of the total budget outlay of Rs. 2,24,789 crore, Reddy projected revenue expenditure of around Rs. 1,80,393 crore and capital expenditure, including loan repayments and other capital disbursements of around Rs 44,396 crore.He said the budget estimates entail an overall decrease of 1.4% over the 2019-20 budget estimates because of major economic slowdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While the revenue deficit was estimated at around Rs 18,434 crore, the fiscal deficit was projected at around Rs 48,295 crore. The fiscal deficit will be around 4.78% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP), whereas the revenue deficit will be around 1.82 % of the GSDP.The finance minister said in 2019, the new government (of YSR Congress party) had inherited an economy which had been slowing down. “The tsunami of pending bills to the tune of Rs 60,000 crore left by the previous government only made matters worse. The decline in transfer of central taxes in 2019-20 and 2020-21, the reduced share in the divisible pool for the year 2020-21 and the precipitous decline of revenue realisation on account of Covid-19 induced lockdown measures, further added to the financial stress,” he said.Reddy, however, said the government had been overcoming challenges and going ahead in the path of development and welfare. “We rolled out a new template for pro-people governance through village and ward secretariats and appointment of over 1.2 lakh village/ward secretaries and more than 2.5 lakh volunteers. “Through these secretariats, people can avail 536 services at their doorsteps cutting across multiple government agencies,” he said.The finance minister made considerable allocations to the key departments as part of implementing the welfare agenda of the state government through implementation of Nava Ratnalu (nine jewels) – a set of nine promises made in the election manifesto.He announced allocation of Rs 22,604 crore for secondary and intermediate education and Rs 2,277 crore for higher education. “We have brought in a renewed emphasis on human resources development through schemes like Amma Vodi, Jagananna Vidya Deewana and Jagananna Vasati Deewana, while upgrading public school infrastructure through Mana Badi Nadu-Nedu programme,” he said.For health sector, Reddy said an allocation of Rs 11,419 crore was made, primary to extend affordable health care to the poor under Dr YSR Aarogyasri scheme, apart from expanding the fleet of ambulance services by adding another 1,000 vehicles to the existing 439.The minister announced allocation of Rs 11,891 crore for the agriculture sector, including Rs 3,615 crore for the implementation of Dr YSR Rythu Bharosa-PM Kisan scheme under which an investment support of Rs 13,500 per year is provided to each of 46.51 lakh eligible farmers to meet the input needs.He also announced implementation of free crop insurance scheme and interest free loans and setting up Rythu Bharosa centres. “Besides, the government has taken a historic decision to set up a Price Stabilisation Fund (PSF) of Rs 3,000 crore for market intervention for crops selling below MSP or for non-MSP crops selling below normal price,” he said.The other major allocations made in the budget were: Rs 16,710 crore for panchayat raj and rural development, Rs 11,806 crore for water resources development, Rs 6,588 crore for transport, roads and buildings, Rs 6,984.73 crore for energy and Rs 2,075.56 crore for industrial development.Similarly, an amount of Rs 1,279 crore was allocated for animal husbandry and fisheries, Rs 8,000 crore for provision of 30 lakh house sites for the houseless poor, Rs 3,456 crore for women, child and disabled welfare, Rs 1,365 crore towards zero-interest loans to women self-help groups, Rs 16,000 crore for pensions and Rs 3,000 crore towards YSR Cheyutha scheme to provide financial assistance of Rs 18,750 crore for SC, ST, OBC and minority women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-andhra-pradesh-s-budget-of-rs-2-24-lakh-cr-a-revenue-deficit-of-rs-18k-cr/story-GksTfz9Ctcohz2ffr4ZewJ.html

But we can’t allow the government to get away with its anti-people decisions either. Switching off lights for three minutes on June 17 at 9 pm gives an opportunity for them to register their protest,” said state opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala, adding the steep hike was a cruel blow as many people are reeling under job-loss and income crunch further compounded by the coronavirus crisis.The Congress leader complained that the government’s move amounts to robbing people. “Many of them have lost jobs and are struggling to feed their families. There is no justification in hiking when the people are in the midst of a deep crisis. This tantamount to robbing the hapless,” he said. Despite protests happening all over Kerala, the state government has not taken any steps to address the issue of inflated power bills. Let's raise our voice against this. Join the #LightsOffKerala protest at 9pm tomorrow (June 17) and switch off lights across Kerala for 3 minutes pic.twitter.com/Ml88TMTZf4There are widespread complaints that many consumers are getting bills that are three to four times higher than what they have been paying.Malayalam actor Madubal had got a bill of Rs 5,714 for his locked house but after he posted his woes online, it was reduced to Rs 300 in a day. Many such glaring complaints came to light in recent days.State electricity board chairman SN Pillai said due to lockdown meter-reading was not done in three months and consumers were charged nominally during this period and later differences were settled in the latest bill. Although he promised that the excess amount, if any, will be adjusted later, but the people without a regular income say it is a real shock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/switch-off-lights-for-3-mins-kerala-congress-power-tariff-hike-protest/story-WGZp8UD0WsUlphHPmJY7rO.html

In a fresh plea in the HC, he said all charges against him were cooked up due to some personal grudges and differences and sought the case be quashed immediately. The state government opposed his plea, saying there is strong evidence against him and that he was filing unnecessary petitions to delay the trial.On June 10, when the trial court in Kottayam took up the case - after a gap due to lockdown - it expressed serious reservation over the bishop’s absence and asked him to appear before it on July 1. The counsel for the bishop had informed the court that he was not able to travel as there were no domestic flights from Jalandhar and he will have to undergo 14-day quarantine as per the government guidelines. The court, however, asked him to make necessary arrangements and appear before it on July 1.The case surfaced two years ago when a 43-year-old nun, also a mother superior, had complained to the police in Kottayam in central Kerala that Mulakkal had raped her several times between 2014 and 2016.The nun is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation based in Punjab. Mulakkal denied the charges, saying he was implicated after he took action against the nun for financial irregularities in the convent.Later, a special investigation team arrested him in September 2018. After 40 days in prison, he was granted bail. Soon after, he was removed from the post of bishop. The SIT had filed the charge sheet against him last year. There were allegations that the accused tried to delay the trial. The petitioner had also complained that some of the witnesses were threatened by the followers of Mulakkal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/franco-mulakkal-moves-kerala-high-court-to-quash-rape-case-against-him/story-oxgCRjMZfa5j1D3r0K6ZtN.html

The 10 MLAs have also been made respondents in the case. Speaking to media persons, Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar said, “the party was compelled to move to the SC after the Speaker refused to schedule timely hearings, despite being reminded that Supreme Court guidelines stipulate that disqualification petitions need to be disposed of with an outer limit of nine months. “In the Manipur matter there are clear guidelines of the Supreme Court to all the legislative assemblies and the speaker that any petition regarding disqualification considering the duration of the legislative assembly or of parliament is just five years, the outer limit to dispose of the petition is just three months,” Chodankar said. “It has been almost nine months since we filed this (petition) before the Speaker and we expected that it will be disposed of quickly. But our Speaker decided to keep the disqualification pending. He has not given respect to SC guidelines despite us reminding him in February,” he added.“We are pleased that the SC issued notice to the Speaker and 10 defected MLAs. The notice is returnable after three weeks. Our petition was represented by Kapil Sibal,” he added. Besides seeking directions to the Speaker that he dispose of the matter within one month, the Congress petition has also sought that the 10 MLAs concerned be restrained to officiate as MLAs and ministers. In July 2019, ten of the 15 Congress legislators announced that they were ‘merging’ with the BJP citing a provision in the law that if more than 2/3rd of the legislators of a political party ‘merge’ with another, it will not attract provisions of the anti-defection law.The Congress has contended that the ‘merger’ of 10 of its MLAs into the BJP was not a merger of parties as envisaged by the 10th schedule of the constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-speaker-given-3-weeks-by-sc-to-reply-in-cong-mlas-disqualification-case/story-9IO51rI31CaJU3jEcZivpN.html

Besides chartered flights we want people coming in ‘Vande Bharat’ flights also tested before they take flights. It is meant to ensure the safety of all,” said state industry minister E P Jayarajan.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan who participated in the video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday, did not get a chance to speak. But two days ago, he had sent a letter to Modi seeking his help on the issue.The state will soon submit a list of its demands to the Centre and Covid-free certificate will be on top of it, said a spokesman of the government. He said around 90 per cent of recent Covid-19 cases are expatriates or people who returned from other states and the state cannot take any further risk.But many expatriates said the state was keen to maintain its records and not interested in its people who were desperate to return home from West Asian countries.“The government’s move is quite impractical. In many Gulf countries, tests are expensive and time-consuming. The Kerala government wants to discourage the return of its people. It is an inhuman act,” said Mansoor Paloor, a leader of the expat community. There are an estimated 18 lakh people from Kerala working in Persian Gulf countries. On Tuesday, the state reported 79 fresh cases of Covid-19, taking the total to 2,621. Of these, 1,336 are active cases, said State Health Minister K K Shailaja.

Chennai alone accounts for 71.49% of all cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-registers-most-covid-deaths-in-a-single-day-cm-says-death-rate-low/story-9uJ3MYSSYAUmvi7TH23VQL.html
16-06-2020||India||HC asks state to inform when primary and pre-primary schools will start||Mumbai: The Bombay high court (HC) has directed Maharashtra government to respond to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by a non-governmental organisation (NGO), Ezra Foundation, which has sought to bar reopening of primary and pre-primary schools – both online and offline – in the state till September because of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The court sought to know about the status of classes for students up to the age of 14 years after the state government informed the HC that it had issued a notification on June 15, which had stated that schools for students up to class II wouldn’t be reopened till September.State advocate-general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said he would respond by Friday on the directions sought by the court.Earlier, a two-member division bench of the HC, comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice KK Tated, while hearing the PIL, filed by Ezra Foundation, through video-conference, was informed by the petitioner’s advocates Shashikant Chaudhari and Manoj Kumar Singh that the health and well-being of children in the age group between six and 14 years would be at risk if schools were allowed to start, either online or offline.The advocates prayed before the court that the students in that age group would be most vulnerable to contract SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, if they are asked to attend classes.Similarly, their heath would take a toll, if they are asked to attend online classes for a prolonged duration and many parents also would not be able to provide expensive tools required for e-learning, they pleaded.The advocates also urged the court to direct the state government to frame guidelines for a “common fee structure” for private schools for the academic year (2020-21), as many parents are facing huge financial constraints due to the lockdown restrictions.They also drew the court’s attention to how many parents have been coerced by several private school authorities to pay fees for the new academic session even though the classes are yet to begin because of the viral outbreak.They prayed for a court-monitored committee for framing guidelines for reopening of schools across the state and also a list of erring schools be prepared for charging fees in advance and called for revoking their registration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-asks-state-to-inform-when-primary-and-pre-primary-schools-will-start/story-uccIcMzb4ZsPKox1ieHkkO.html
16-06-2020||India||Chhattisgarh: Two wild elephants were found dead||Raipur: Two wild elephants were found dead in Chhattisgarh’s Dhamtari and Raigarh districts on Tuesday, as five pachyderms have died over the past eight days in the state.In Dhamtari district, an elephant calf died late on Monday night after it got stuck in a swamp, while a male elephant got electrocuted after coming in contact with a live wire at a farm in Raigarh district’s Dharamjaigarh area.The state forest department officials have recovered the bodies of five elephants from four districts --- Surajpur, Balrampur, Dhamtari, and Raigarh -- since last Tuesday.“The elephant calf was part of a herd that was roaming on the border of Dhamtari and Gariyaband districts. The calf was found dead near Urputi (Mongri) village in the marshland of the Gangrel reservoir in Dhamtari district on Tuesday morning. The animal died late at night on Monday,” said Arun Kumar Pandey, additional principal chief conservator of forest, (wildlife).“We were tracking the herd, but it’s a tough task to keep track of their movement at night. The herd’s footprints were found near the calf’s carcass, which suggests that the animals unsuccessfully tried to pull the baby elephant out,” he added.The forest officials are awaiting the autopsy report to ascertain the exact cause of its death.In another incident, a tusker got electrocuted early Tuesday morning in Girisha village under the Dharamjaigarh forest division.A herd of 27 elephants was roaming for the last couple of days, and on Tuesday morning a tusker was found dead.“Primary investigation suggests that a villager had pilfered electricity to operate a borewell on his farm. The tusker came in contact with the naked wire and got electrocuted. Two persons, Bhadoram Rathia and Bal Singh, who owns the farm, have been arrested,” said Santosh Singh, superintendent of police (SP), Raigarh district.The bodies of two elephants were recovered from the Pratappur forest range, while another jumbo was found dead in the neighbouring Balrampur district last week.Later, three state forest department officials and a guard were suspended, while a show-cause notice was issued to a divisional forest officer in Balrampur district for alleged dereliction of duty.North Chhattisgarh is home to around 240 wild elephants that have led to several man-animal conflicts in the past few years in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-two-wild-elephants-were-found-dead/story-ULYXu7PcQiOqsL3mlh42EL.html
16-06-2020||India||Will decide in July on international flights’ resumption if states, aviation ecosystem onboard: Hardeep Singh Puri||India will take a decision on resumption of international passenger flights in July if coronavirus behaves in a “predictable manner” and the entire aviation ecosystem and state governments are onboard, Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Tuesday. The country resumed domestic passenger flights from May 25 after a gap of two months amid the coronavirus pandemic. Scheduled international passenger flights, however, continue to remain suspended in India.  “I am often asked, when can you start international civil aviation? If you leave it to me, and if the ecosystem works, and if we have the predictability in terms of behaviour of the virus, I think in the coming month we should start taking the decision. But those decisions will not be taken by the Indian civil aviation ministry,” Puri said. “Those decisions will be taken by the governments after looking at their domestic situation,” he said at a webinar titled ‘Reposing the Faith in Flying’ organised by the GMR group. “As we have seen recently that there is a major state in south India, after we opened up, they ordered the lockdown back. I have seen this happening in other countries. We are trying to ensure that this does not happen,” the minister noted.  The Tamil Nadu government had recently decided to impose lockdown in the capital city of Chennai, starting June 19 for a period of 12 days, in view of rising number of Covid-19 cases. Puri said the central government is trying to make sure that “when we take steps, they are incremental, and they are predictable, and that we increase the ways of travel domestically and that we move in the direction of opening international travel systematically without endangering and inviting a backlash”.“For us to be able to receive passengers on international routes, our states must be ready. We are in a constant dialogue with them,” he added.  The aviation minister said a decision regarding resumption of international travel can be taken in the coming months, even earlier, when domestic air traffic would reach 50-55 per cent of its pre-Covid-19 capacity, and other states would be in the position to absorb more number of passengers coming in.“In any case, it is not our call. It is a call where all the stakeholders, including the passengers and the entire ecosystem, are ready,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-decide-in-july-on-international-flights-resumption-if-states-aviation-ecosystem-onboard-hardeep-singh-puri/story-DpXEqC2gkGA9MRVNl83ziN.html

New Delhi on Monday impressed upon Pakistan to give up its territorial ambition and criticised it for raising the Kashmir issue at the UN body and expressed “serious concern” over Pakistan’s audacity to accuse others of “effecting a state-sponsored genocide”.“It’s unfortunate, however, not unexpected from the deep state of Pakistan which is continuing incessant abuse of its membership of this august Council for propagating an illegal, immoral and inhuman territorial ambition.“It very conveniently ignores that Vienna Declaration & Programme of Action (VDPA) explicitly states that the principle of self-determination must not be used as a garb to promote activities detrimental to the territorial integrity and political unity of member states in violation of the UN Charter,” said the India representative.Drawing the attention of the council to “unabated torture”, “systematic persecution” of religious minorities in Pakistan, New Delhi said it is highly irresponsible on Islamabad’s part to raise the issue of Kashmir. “This epicentre of global terrorism (Pakistan) very irresponsibly harps on self-determination of the already democratic Jammu and Kashmir.“We are witnessing in Pakistan unabated torture, maiming and systematic persecution of religious minorities. Attacks on a Hindu funeral procession and a Christian church days ago in Sindh and Punjab provinces portray the horrific plight of various minorities in Pakistan,” said Aryan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-should-practise-good-neighbourliness-towards-us-india-at-unhrc/story-wJKW5iyuG0nL4pmNNn31bI.html

For us the death of even one Indian is unsettling but it is also true that India is one of the countries where there have been least deaths due to Covid-19,” he said. “The two weeks of `Unlock 1’ has given us a lesson that if follow all rules and directions, then the country will be able to minimise its losses. To even think of stepping out without a mask or face cover is not right at present. ‘Do gaj ki doori’, hand-washing and use of sanitisers is of utmost importance. With markets opening and people stepping out, these precautions are even more important,” he added. The Prime Minister said that green shoots are visible in the economy because of the efforts made in the last few weeks.He said that timely decisions have helped in containing coronavirus in the country.“Two weeks have passed since Unlock 1. Our experience during this time could be beneficial for us in the future. Today I will get to know ground reality from you. Your suggestions will help in chalking out future strategy,” he said. The Prime Minister said that timing matters a lot in overcoming any crisis.“Timely decisions have helped a lot in containing coronavirus in the country. When India’s fight against Covid-19 will be analysed in future, this time will be remembered for how we worked together and served as an example of cooperative federalism,” he said.The Prime Minister said that in the last few weeks, thousands of Indians returned to India from abroad and hundreds of migrant workers reached their home towns.“Almost all modes of transport have resumed operations, still Covid-19 impact has not been that huge in India as in other parts of the world,” he said.Prime Minister Modi held a detailed meeting with senior ministers and officials to review India’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic on Saturday.With an increase of 10,667 cases and 380 deaths in the past 24 hours, the Covid-19 count in India reached 3,43,091 on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/losses-due-to-covid-19-can-be-minimised-if-all-rules-are-followed-pm-modi/story-35YLQgQG4ZZvvMi5ZpuBhP.html

So far, the viral infection has claimed 25 lives in Uttarakhand.A bulletin issued by the state health department on Tuesday said the deceased Covid-19 patient was referred to Susheela Tiwari Government Hospital from Base Hospital in Haldwani.The deceased woman had returned from Delhi to Almora by bus on May 26 amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions, which were imposed to contain the spread of the Covid-19 outbreak, and was advised to remain quarantined at her home.Of the 67 fresh Covid-19 positive cases reported on Tuesday, seven were local residents and four were primary contacts of those who had earlier contracted SARS-COV-2, which causes the disease, and two were healthcare workers from Dehradun.The rest of the Covid-19 patients have returned to Uttarakhand from Maharashtra, Delhi-national capital region (NCR), Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Punjab, and Haryana.The new Covid-19 positive cases were reported from the following districts: Almora (10), Dehradun (12), Haridwar (8), Nainital (2), Pauri Garhwal (2), Tehri Garhwal (14), Pithoragarh (7), Udham Singh Nagar (8), and Uttarkashi (4).On Tuesday, five Covid-19 patients, including Dehradun (4) and Almora (1), were discharged from hospitals after they recovered from the viral infection.Uttarakhand has tested over 47,000 swab samples of which the results of over 4,600 are still pending.Dehradun district has reported the maximum number of Covid-19 positive cases at 493, followed by Nainital (340), Tehri Garhwal (308) and Haridwar (219).

16-06-2020||India||Private hospitals in Telangana oppose move to cap Covid-19 treatment cost||Private hospitals in Telangana say they will petition the state government over the upper limit fixed by it regarding the treatment of a Covid-19 patient in their hospitals. A meeting of various private hospitals in the state would be held in Hyderabad on Wednesday to discuss the implications of the government’s order and request it to reconsider its decision.“We shall work out the actual costs to be incurred by the private hospitals to treat a Covid-19 patient. We shall come out with a formula and place it before the government. We are planning to seek an appointment with the health minister and other senior officials shortly,” Dr B Bhaskar Rao, president of Telangana Super-speciality Private Hospitals’ Association, told Hindustan Times.The Telangana government, which announced on Sunday that the private hospitals would be allowed to admit and treat Covid-19 patients in the state, issued an order on Monday capping the cost of treatment for such patients. According to the order issued by special chief secretary (medical and health) A Santhi Kumari, the cost of the package to be charged by the private hospitals, including corporate hospitals, cannot exceed Rs 4,000 per day in normal wards (including isolation), Rs 7,500 in Intensive Care Units (ICU) without ventilator and Rs 9,000 with ventilator support.“The package includes monitoring (of patient) and investigations like CBC, urine routine, anti-HIV, ultrasound, ECG, 2D Echo, X-ray etc, apart from drugs, consultations, bed charges, meals and procedures like urinary tract catheterisation etc,” the order said.The hospitals, however, could charge additionally for PPE, interventional procedures like bronchoscopy, biopsy and pleural tapping, administration of high-end drugs and high-end investigations like CT-Scan, MRI, PET scan, etc.“We do not know how the government has arrived at this figure of upper limit of treatment cost for Covid-19 in private hospitals. The officials have neither consulted us nor discussed with us the cost of treatment for Covid-19,” Bhaskar Rao said.The private hospitals, Rao underscored, have to make a lot of arrangements for treating the Covid-19 patients. “We have to create separate isolation facilities, wards and ICUs without causing any inconvenience for other patients. We have to have dedicated manpower, including doctors and para-medical staff, exclusively to deal with Covid-19 patients, as they are not supposed to attend to other patients. We have to provide them PPEs and other facilities. The cost of treatment has to be worked out taking into consideration all these factors,” Rao pointed out.Upon being told that private hospitals are allowed to charge extra for antibiotic injections, various other procedures and creating additional facilities, Rao said there was no clarity from the government in this regard. “For example, we cannot use the equipment like a ventilator used for Covid-19 patients for other patients immediately. We have to fumigate the equipment thoroughly before using it again,” he said.The association president wondered why the government should worry about charging the Covid-19 patients by private hospitals. “Only those who can afford treatment will come to us. There are enough government hospitals to provide free and affordable treatment to other Covid-19 patients. Even Gandhi Hospital still has enough beds. Only if the government hospitals are insufficient to tackle the huge number of cases, the patients will come to private hospitals,” Rao argued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-hospitals-in-telangana-oppose-move-to-cap-covid-19-treatment-cost/story-GahaSkc8mPk8HnN83Z6QcM.html
16-06-2020||India||SC notice to Goa speaker on Cong’s disqualification pleas||The Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday issued notice to Goa Speaker Rajesh Patnekar after Goa Pradesh Congress President (GPCC) Girish Chodankar complained that a decision on the disqualification of 10 party members of the legislative assembly (MLAs), who had defected to the ruling Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) last July has been kept pending since August 8, 2019.Chodankar stated in his plea that though the matter was heard at length in February before the lockdown restrictions, which were imposed from end-March to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, a decision is yet to be taken.Earlier on July 10, 2019, the 10 Congress MLAs, claiming to form two-third of the lawmakers from the party in the 40-member state assembly, merged their outfit with the BJP.Speaker Patnekar took note of the merger and on assembly records, showed them as BJP lawmakers. Later, Chandrakant Kavalekar, Jenniffer Monserrate, and Filipe Rodrigues were inducted as Cabinet ministers in the Pramod Sawant-led state government.On Tuesday, senior advocates Kapil Sibal and Gourab Banerjee, appeared in the SC on behalf of Chodankar, and informed the apex court’s three-member bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde and also included Justices MR Shah and AS Bopanna, that no decision has been taken on the disqualification pleas filed against the 10 MLAs on August 8, 2019.They cited a recent judgment of the apex court in Keisham Meghachandra Singh vs. Hon’ble Speaker of the Manipur Legislative Assembly (2020), where the court held that disqualification petitions under the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution should be decided either within a reasonable timeframe or within three months.“It’s clear that the respondent (Goa Speaker) has deliberately restrained himself from deciding the disqualification petition and also the interim reliefs. Such deliberate inaction or indecision on the part of the respondent clearly amounts to a failure to exercise the jurisdiction conferred under Tenth Schedule of the Constitution,” the petition stated.Sibal urged the court to direct Goa Speaker Patnekar for expeditious disposal of the disqualification pleas within a month.The petition has also demanded the 10 MLAs be restrained from functioning as ministers and MLAs till their disqualification pleas are decided.The bench issued notice to the office of the Goa Speaker, while the next date of the hearing has been fixed after three weeks.The election to the Goa assembly was held in March 2017.Though the Congress emerged as the single-largest party with 17 MLAs, the BJP combined with other regional parties formed the government headed by chief minister Manohar Parrikar.However, the state plunged into political uncertainty after CM Parrikar passed away in March, 2019. Congress’s Atanasio Monserrate, also known as ‘Babush’ Monserrate, won the by-poll in May, 2019, which was held to fill the Panaji assembly seat that had fallen vacant because of Parrikar’s death. Two months later, Monserrate and nine other Congress lawmakers merged their outfit with the BJP.Speaker Patnekar conducted the first hearing of the case on October 15, 2019, and the last one in February before the lockdown restrictions came into force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-notice-to-goa-speaker-on-cong-s-disqualification-pleas/story-IBcQFZh6QkYgRIy4YmJU1K.html
16-06-2020||India||With cleaner rivers after lockdown, Bengal expects big Hilsa harvest||The 84-day lockdown may prove to be a boon for millions of fish-loving Bengalis, who eagerly wait for this time of the year for the queen of fish - the Hilsa - to arrive from the sea.Experts said that as pollution in the river Ganga and its tributaries is less this year because of the lockdown, it could attract schools of Hilsa to migrate upstream to breed.“This year we are expecting a good catch. All the industries were shut because of the lockdown and pollution is down in the River Hooghly. This could attract schools of Hilsa. Also the rains and other conditions have been favourable,” said a senior official of the state fishery department.HT had earlier reported that for the first time in many years, several stretches of the Ganga including Kolkata were conforming to Central Pollution Control Board’s (CPCB) standards for the quality of river waters. The biological oxygen demand was less than 3 mg/l, dissolved oxygen was more than 4 mg/l and ph 6 to 9. The biological oxygen demand is the oxygen needed by the river to sustain life.The Hilsa, which usually spend their lives in the sea, migrate into the rivers to breed during this time of the year. If they don’t find good waters in the Hooghly (a tributary of the Ganga) they head for the rivers in Bangladesh skipping Bengal. In 2012 Bangladesh had imposed a ban on export of Hilsa to India. The ban was lifted in 2019. “Cyclone Amphan, which has left the state devastated, may also boost the Hilsa harvest. Cyclonic storms churn up minerals from the sea bed which would help in plankton production. Plankton being a fish food helps in attracting more fish,” said Utpal Bhowmik, a hisla expert and the former head of the riverine fishery division at Central Inland Fishery Research Institute.Every year major fishing activities remain suspended between April 15 and June 14 to protect the fishery resources and biodiversity during the breeding season. This year the ban was from March 25 when the countrywide lockdown was announced.“The extended fishing ban because of the lockdown will surely boost fish production. The fishermen are all ready to venture into the sea within a day or two. The ban has been lifted but the sea is rough because of bad weather. We are just waiting for the weather to clear,” said Abdar Mallik, secretary of Sagar Marine Matsya Khuti Cooperative Society, a fishermen forum in south Bengal.But there is an irony. Fishermen in the coastal districts of the Bengal pointed out that even though they are expecting a bounty this time because of the lockdown, cleaner water and good rains, cyclone Amphan has left them devastated.“Thousands of fishing boats have been damaged in the storm. We know there is a bounty out there in the sea but there are not enough boats to venture out. Many people have lost their boats,” said Pradip Chatterjee, convener of National platform for small scale fish workers. More than 8,000 fishing boats have been damaged in the cyclone of May 20, while 37,711 fishing nets have been damaged, according to government estimates. The administration is providing Rs 2,600 to the affected fishermen for damaged nets and Rs 5,000 who have lost their boats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-cleaner-rivers-after-lockdown-bengal-expects-big-hilsa-harvest/story-oLX7JuorYlqSto6hIgrzfI.html

How and under what circumstances were our officer and soldiers martyred?” Congress asked in one of the questions.Earlier in the afternoon, the army issued a statement which said it had suffered multiple casualties, including that of an officer, in a “violent face off” with China’s People’s Liberation Army on Monday night in eastern Ladakh. It also added that there were casualties on both sides.It added that the incident happened during the de-escalation process in the Galwan valley.HT learns that the officer killed in the clashes last night was the commanding officer of the unit involved and that one of the other casualties is that of a JCO. These are the first Indian casualties in a clash with the PLA since 1975 when an Indian patrol was ambushed by Chinese troops in Arunachal Pradesh.The army also said that “senior military officials of the two sides are currently meeting to defuse the situation”.Also Read: Indian, Chinese army officials hold meeting to defuse tension after face-off in LadakhAll the deaths are from thrown stones and rods that were used by the soldiers, people familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity.

16-06-2020||India||Monsoon arrives over north-western India, may reach Delhi early||Monsoon has advanced into parts of north-western India on Tuesday, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities. It has covered many parts of eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP), western and eastern Madhya Pradesh (MP), they added.IMD scientists are also expecting monsoon to arrive in the national capital, Delhi, earlier than normal, but they will confirm depending on how favourable conditions are for its advancement in the next four to five days.“It will be humid and hot with maximum temperature ranging from 40 to 43 degrees Celsius in most parts of north-western India, including Delhi, but there will be no heatwave condition. We are expecting the monsoon to pick up again from Friday due to the formation of a low-pressure system and advance towards western UP, it could even reach up to Noida around Friday or Saturday. But we cannot say if the onset of monsoon can be announced immediately,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre (RWFC).The normal date for the onset of monsoon over Delhi is June 27.The northern limit of monsoon (northernmost boundary up to which monsoon rains have advanced) is passing through Kandla, and Ahmedabad in Gujarat; Indore, Raisen, and Khajuraho in MP and Fatehpur, and Bahraich in UP.Monsoon has reached UP at least four to five days in advance, as compared to its normal track.“Monsoon has advanced well so far with help from a low-pressure area, which developed over the Bay of Bengal last week. The low-pressure system had moved inland from the Odisha coast and helped it advance bringing a lot of rain. Another low-pressure system is likely to develop over the north of the Bay of Bengal on Friday. These low-pressure systems move west by north-westwards. If it does develop, it will strengthen the monsoon and help it advance further,” said K Sathi Devi, head, national weather forecasting centre (NWFC).The low-pressure system, which had helped the monsoon flow advance all of next week, has weakened. There is unlikely to be any rain in the north-western parts of the country in the next three days, according to IMD.A cyclonic circulation is lying over eastern UP and a trough runs from north-western Rajasthan to the cyclonic circulation over eastern UP across southern Haryana and western UP. Under the influence of these two systems, heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely in Konkan, Goa, and over central Maharashtra during the next two days.Rainfall intensity over eastern parts of the country is likely to increase and heavy to very rainfall is likely over the region, including sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Sikkim, in the next two days. There will be widespread rain over Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, and Mizoram during the next five days, according to IMD’s bulletin on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-arrives-over-nw-india-may-reach-delhi-early/story-Apc5VonimxegoMSJheUZEK.html

This had led to a sharp reaction from Maharashtra NavNirman Sena (MNS) chief Raj Thackeray, who said Maharashtra, too, in that case should place restrictions on entry of workers from UP. Yogi Adityanath government had instructed officials to thrash out the contours of the commission on a war footing to ensure that the huge migrant workforce could be provided employment in the state and their interests safeguarded with an effective regulatory framework.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe commission has been named UP Kamgar Shramik Sewayojan Avam Rozgar Ayog and it will be headed by chief minister Yogi Adityanath as its chairman and will also include two vice-chairpersons, state minister Siddhartnath Singh was quoted as saying by the agency.Close to 30 lakh migrant labourers have returned to UP after losing livelihoods during the lockdown. The state government is also busy carrying out an exercise for their skill mapping. An official spokesman had recently said that the skill suggested that the largest number of migrant workers have come from the real estate development sector.On June 5, Yogi Adityanath had said that around 42 lakh people were already absorbed in the state through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and others were getting enlisted for several construction projects that have resumed in the state. Also Read: As migrants’ return slows down, Covid-19 cases decline in Bihar, UP, Jharkhand and MP“A comprehensive project has been prepared by the state. Skill mapping of all migrants is being done including other youth and unemployed workforce. We are working together with industries, businesses to provide them jobs. Additionally, there is a bid to increase employment in other sectors like agriculture.” Adityanath said while speaking exclusively to Shashi Shekhar, the chief editor of Hindi daily Hindustan.He added that his government was committed to providing good healthcare and means of sustenance to all migrant workers apart from providing them with appropriate jobs.He added that the new commission will bring ministers, worker representatives and industry people on one platform with one common goal. He said the government was looking at the MSME sector and the allied agriculture sector as major potential employment providers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yogi-adityanath-to-head-up-commission-to-safeguard-workers-jobs-rights/story-79Rbyw0X0JoB4woLi4p7aO.html

The PM also stressed that the economy has started to look up. The meeting comes in the backdrop of a “violent face off” with China’s People’s Liberation Army on Monday night in eastern Ladakh.“We are coming back to normalcy through unlock 1. If we follow, all the precautions and the SOPs, we will be able to battle it out with minimal damage. When India’s fight against Covid-19 will be analysed in future, this time will be remembered for how we worked together and served as an example of cooperative federalism,” said the PM at the start of the two-day meeting.With an “economic focus”, the Centre, what it dubbed Unlock 1, went about gradually opening the economy in a three-phased plan. The domestic flights have started resumption of services; the shopping malls, restaurants, places of worship have been opened. Metro services, however, remain shut. Public transport - buses, private cabs - too is available under the new guidelines. A lockdown is still in place in containment zones till June 30.“Despite our large population, we minimised the deaths and our recovery rate is 50%. That has become a point of discussion across the world,’’ he said.The more precautions the states took, Modi underlined, the better abled they would be to fight Covid-19, which would lead to greater opportunities for the economy to bounce back.“In the next few days, we should be able to take examples of the positive stories of economic activities from the states and replicate. We are seeing green shoots in the economy, power consumption, for instance has increased, the sale of two wheelers was now at 70% of pre-lockdown numbers,’’ said PM Modi. He also highlighted how agriculture sector, on the back of recent reforms, was playing its role in reviving the economy.Spotlighting that many people have returned to the country in the recent past, the PM said yet the impact of the coronavirus here is not “that huge” as compared to the world situation. “In the last few weeks, thousands of Indians returned to India from abroad and hundreds of migrant workers reached their hometowns. Almost all modes of transport have resumed operations, still Covid-19 impact has not been that huge in India as in other parts of the world,” said the PM. Speaking about the ‘unlocking’ process that began on June 1, the PM Modi said that the call for “do gaj ki doori” (social distancing) was crucial at this point along with wearing a face cover while stepping out. Individual experiences of states could be shared with each other so that there was collective learning, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-shoots-have-begun-to-be-visible-in-economy-pm-modi-to-chief-ministers/story-qCsI3LK4ZtyiYDhqAuNciJ.html

The donation is part of President Donald Trump’s offer of critical supplies in response to India’s urgent needs, the US embassy said in a statement.The ventilators, made in the US, use leading edge technology and are compact and deployable. They will provide India with flexibility in treating patients affected by the Coronavirus, the statement said.The ventilators, part of the 200 machines the US intends to provide to India, were donated through the US Agency for International Development (USAID). USAID is working closely with Indian health ministry, Indian Red Cross Society and other stakeholders in both countries to assist in the delivery, transportation and placement of the ventilators in select healthcare facilities across the country.At an event to commemorate the arrival of the ventilators in India, US ambassador Kenneth Juster said: “The Covid-19 pandemic poses an unprecedented global health threat. It is only through partnership and cooperation that we will be able to ensure a healthy future for people across the world. “In this spirit, the US is pleased to provide the people of India with a donation of ventilators, made possible by the generosity of the American people and the innovation of American private industry.”USAID is also funding a support package for the ventilators that includes accompanying equipment, medical supplies, technical assistance and service plans.This donation builds on the $9.5 million that USAID and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have committed to India in response to the pandemic. The assistance is helping to strengthen clinical care, disseminate essential health messages and improve disease surveillance.The US has been the world’s largest provider of bilateral assistance in healthcare. Since 2009, it has provided more than $100 billion in health assistance and nearly $70 billion in humanitarian assistance worldwide. Trump first announced the plan to donate the ventilators through a tweet on May 16, when he said the two sides were also working on developing a vaccine for Covid-19.

16-06-2020||India||India sets up first mobile Covid-testing lab||India has set up its first mobile testing laboratory in a bid to meet the growing demand to conduct coronavirus disease (Covid-19) tests. The laboratory can be deployed at remote and inaccessible areas in the country, where there is no such facility, even as the overall Covid-19 testing capacity has reached three lakh swab samples per day.The mobile laboratory belongs to the biosafety level 2 (BSL-II) category, which was created within eight days by a team from Andhra Pradesh MedTech Zone Limited.BSLs are ranked from one to four and are categorised on the basis of the organisms that the researchers are dealing with. BSL-I is considered to be the least hazardous, while BSL-IV poses the maximum safety risk. Each level builds on the previous category, adding more layers of constraints and barriers.The organisms include viruses, bacteria, fungi, parasites, etc. SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, belongs to the BSL-II category.“India’s first mobile I-lab flagged off from @AP_MedTechZone. Built in eight days flat, it is an on the wheel Bio-Safety Level-2 Lab with on-site Elisa, RtPCR & Bio-chem analysers. It can be readily deployed in the remotest locations. Kudos to the team,” tweeted Alok Kumar, a member of the Niti Aayog.The Andhra Pradesh MedTech Zone Limited, spread over 270 acres, is a dedicated zone to medical device manufacturing and was inaugurated by the Andhra government two years ago.The facility aims to put India on the global map of high-end medical equipment production and make healthcare products affordable and accessible not only in the country, but also the world at large.It also has set a target for reducing the cost of manufacturing up to 40% and also minimising the import dependency for the country, which is currently pegged at around 75%.However, over the past few months, the zone is producing several items that are key to the treatment of Covid-19 patients, including test kits and ventilators.India has been constantly ramping up its Covid-19 testing capacity since the viral outbreak first came to light in end-January after a medical student came back to her native Kerala from Wuhan, the epicentre of the pandemic in central China.Earlier, a single laboratory under the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune could conduct about 2,500 tests a day in February.Now, 907 laboratories – 659 and 248 in the government and private sectors, respectively, – across the country are conducting tests of around three lakh swab samples a day.“Though the turnaround time for a report varies, usually, we try to give it within 48 hours,” said a senior microbiologist in one of the government-run laboratories conducting Covid-19 tests.So far, 59,21,069 swab samples have been tested since January 22, including 1,54,935 in the past 24 hours.The Centre has reviewed the situation in the national capital, which has reported around 10,000 fresh Covid-19 positive cases over the past five days and each of its 11 districts in Delhi has been assigned a set of laboratories to conduct tests.“The swab samples from each of these 11 districts in Delhi are being sent to these laboratories to ensure timely testing and making the results available without any delay. At present, Delhi has 42 laboratories, which have a combined testing capacity of around 17,000 samples a day,” said a statement by the Union Ministry of Health & Family Welfare (MoHFW).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-sets-up-first-mobile-covid-testing-lab/story-YvtNiwZnoUJlo6nMHl0SAM.html

Will the Raksha Mantri confirm?,” Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala tweeted. Congress Lok Sabha MP Shashi Tharoor said the development was “tragic news” and needed “resolute handling” by the government.“The tragic news from Ladakh is shocking & calls for resolute handling by our Govt. Meanwhile let us bow our heads in tribute to the three martyrs who gave their lives to protect India, & honour those who serve on our borders every day, risking their lives for our nation,” Tharoor said in a tweet.The clash in Ladakh came weeks after the stand-off began.Earlier on Tuesday, the army said in a statement that it had suffered multiple casualties, including that of an officer, in a “violent face off” with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on Monday night in eastern Ladakh. It also said that there were casualties on both sides.Defence Minister Rajnath Singh reviewed the current operational situation after the clash on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), along with the Chief of Defence Staff Gen Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs.The clash in Ladakh came a day after Singh in a virtual rally that focused on Jammu and Kashmir said India and China want to resolve the stand-off between their border troops through dialogue.

He asserted that the executive capital would be shifted to Visakhapatnam, while Amaravati would be retained as legislative capital and Kurnool would be made judicial capital.“At present, the three capitals bill is pending in the legislative process. I am confident that the bill would be approved soon,” he said.The state’s economy, the Governor added, had shown tremendous resilience within the context of a global slowdown, even in pre-Covid-19 times. Andhra Pradesh registered an economic growth rate of 8.16% in 2019-20, the Governor said, adding this is above the national average of 5% over the same period.The Governor also touched upon the development and welfare programmes initiated by the state government in the last one year in tune with the Navaratnalu (nine jewels) – a set of nine promises made in the election manifesto of the YSR Congress party.On the steps taken to fight the Covid-19 menace, the Governor impressed upon the house that the government has been taking stringent measures to contain the spread of the disease by stepping up tests and bringing down the death rate.Apart from sanitising every seat in the assembly and council halls, the health department authorities conducted Covid-19 tests on the MLAs and MLCs who had not undergone the tests earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-budget-session-begins-cm-jagan-reddy-in-assembly-sans-face-mask/story-i6YLf6vS0okX2yMP2iGhXJ.html

16-06-2020||India||Gadget addiction among children during lockdown a cause of concern: Study||A study conducted by Jaipur-based JK Lone Children’s Hospital has found that the lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, have had an adverse impact on the physical, mental and emotional health of the impressionable minds, resulting in an addiction to electronic devices, obesity, and an irritable behavioural pattern.The study, which was conducted online across 30 Indian cities, has concluded that the children’s addiction to electronic devices during the lockdown increased up to three times, as they spent between two and five hours a day on their favourite gadgets.The survey revealed that 65% of the children became addicted to electronic devices, while 50% of them couldn’t stay away from their gadgets for even half an hour.A rise in incidences of no mobile phone phobia was also observed.“Children were found to be flying into a fit of rage, uncontrollable crying, disobedience to their parents, and also displayed irritable behavioural pattern, if they were told to lay off their electronic devices,” said Dr. Ashok Gupta, medical superintendent and senior professor at JK Lone Hospital. Dr. Gupta was the guiding force behind the study, which also included other doctors from the hospital such as Dr. Ramesh Chaudhary, Dr. Dhanraj Bagri, Dr. Kamlesh Agarwal, Dr. Vivek Athwani, and Dr. Anil Sharma.Dr. Gupta said it has been proven worldwide that the mental and physical development of children’s faculties is hindered due to excessive use of electronic devices. India might face a similar problem, he warned.The study said children’s linguistic skills, power of critical and analytical thinking would be vastly reduced because of their growing addiction to electronic devices.It urged parents and policymakers to be aware of this emerging trend of addiction to electronic devices and limit e-learning, as it cannot be a viable substitute for the traditional way of classroom teaching.The online survey was conducted from June 1 to 15 and the sample size was 203 respondents from Jaipur, Jodhpur, Udaipur, Bhilwara, Ajmer, Alwar, Kota, Ganganagar, Sikar, Churu, Nagaur, and Bharatpur in Rajasthan and other big cities such as the Delhi-national capital region (NCR), Kolkata, Mumbai, Agra, Lucknow, and Chandigarh.Two-thirds of the respondent parents said they had noticed changes in their children’s behavioural patterns and habits during the lockdown restrictions.Complaints of daytime sleepiness and tiredness, headache, irritability, weight gain, back pain, etc; have been observed among their children.Also, 45% of the children have had difficulty sleeping at night because of reduced physical activity and a simultaneous uptick in addiction to electronic devices.The study found that the average sleep duration for the children during lockdown was 8.7 hours per day. Up to 7% of children’s bedtime anxiety increased by 32%. While the incidence of uncontrolled anger and tantrums rose by 30% among the children.Many respondent parents have expressed their reservations about e-learning. Around 33% of respondents said they didn’t see any improvement in the level of their children’s education and 19% felt that there was a dip in the standard, as compared to before.About 38% of the respondents had to buy new electronic devices for their children to attend online classes, which put a financial burden on them.Dr. Gupta, however, advocated a two-way interaction between teachers and students and emphasised on holding practical classes.“Over 50% of the schools share one-way pre-recorded or live videos to conduct online classes,” he added.Also, at least 83% of the respondent parents supervised their children’s studies and home tasks during the lockdown and 66% of the students did self-study at home. While 92% of the respondent parents gave consent to the schools to hold online classes.Mobile phones emerged as the most preferred medium for virtual teaching, which was between one and eight hours a day.There have been some positive spin-offs of online classes for the children, including a greater focus on self-study and value for time, exploring new technological tools, and showing greater affection to their family members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gadget-addiction-among-children-during-lockdown-a-cause-of-concern-study/story-2Y2HmdPNnEVtZC6NBJWdzN.html

16-06-2020||India||Aggressive testing, fewer returning migrants: Why 4 states see a drop in new Covid-19 cases||The number of Covid-19 cases are rising rapidly in the country. But there are four states - Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh - which are reporting a decline in the rate of new infections.These states have seen the rate of increase drop by nearly two per cent, giving relief to local authorities.Three of these states are the biggest source of migrant workers in the country. The number of Covid-19 cases starting swelling here when these workers started returning home due to the Covid-19 lockdown.There were fears that these migrants will take the pandemic to rural areas, which has very poor health infrastructure as compared to urban areas. So, the state governments kept the returning workers in quarantine for a period ranging from seven to 21 days.But now, since the number of migrants returning to home states has fallen, the rate of Covid-19 spread has also slowed down.“Most migrant workers have reached their home destinations. We continue to coordinate with the state governments to send back remaining migrant workers,” Railway Board Chairman Vinod Kumar Yadav said on Monday. Indian Railways has been running Shramik Special trains to ferry these migrants to their home states from different parts of the country.The railways had ferried over 60 lakh migrant workers in 4,450 Shramik special trains since May 1.In Bihar, the number of Covid-19 cases increased to 6,581 on June 15 from 3,923 on June 1. But, the rate of increase was 10.81 per cent in the second week of June as compared to about 12 per cent in the first week.According to Bihar public relations department, around 2.1 million workers have returned to Bihar since May 1, when the Shramik Special trains started. Of them, only 2,50,000 came in two week of June. Anupam Kumar, Bihar’s public relations secretary, said that the state government expects the cases to go down as very few workers are likely to return from this week onwards.State Health Secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh said that the state has ramped up its testing capacity with facilities installed in all the 38 districts. The number of samples tested till Monday was 1.27 lakh, he added.The Uttar Pradesh government’s health data shows that the weekly average of increase in the Covid-19 cases in the first week of June was 412 cases per day, which reduced to 356 cases per day in the second week. The state has deployed 1.21 lakh-strong surveillance teams to gather samples and test them. “These teams have surveyed over 92 lakh homes and covered 4.69 crore people,” Principal Secretary, Health, Amit Mohan Prasad said.The second week of Unlock 1 that began June 1 has brought some reprieve for Jharkhand as well. The pandemic’s growth trajectory peaked on June 8 when the state recorded the highest ever single-day spike of 187 new cases. It took a downward trend thereafter with on average 50 cases per day being reported in the last four days. From 610 cases on May 31, the state’s tally on June 15 had increased to 1,151 cases.In Madhya Pradesh, the number of new cases recorded has fallen from 1,424 in last week of May to 1,401 in second week of June. The reason for this is just 54,282 workers came back to the state in June as compared to over three lakh in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aggressive-testing-fewer-returning-migrants-why-4-states-see-a-drop-in-new-covid-19-cases/story-HqBxbPrdl8B042SAQx8diL.html

It was a clean operation, there was no collateral damage,” Kumar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI on encounter in Shopian.“Our focus now will be on north Kashmir,” Kumar added.The so-called commander of the Islamic State Jammu and Kashmir (ISJK) Adil Ahmad Wani and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) cadre Shaheen Ahmad Thoker were killed on May 25 at Khud Hanjipora Kulgam while Hizbul Mujahideen (HM) commander Parvaiz Ahmad Pandith and JeM commander Shakir Ahmed Itoo were neutralised on May 30 at Wanpora Kulgam.Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) group commander Aaqib Ramzan Wani and Awanitpora JeM commander Mohammad Maqbool Chopan killed on June 2 at Saimoo Tral Awantipora.According to sources, on June 3, in a major breakthrough JeM top commander Fauji Bhai, who was a resident of Pakistan, HM top commander Manzoor Ahmad Kar, JeM commander Javaid Ahmad Zargar were neutralised at Kangan Pulwama.HM’s “top commander” Ishfaq Ahmad Itoo, JeM top commander Owais Ahmad Malik were killed on June 7 at Reban in Shopian.

They have extensive injury marks to their neck, face, thighs and backNew Delhi has not formally reacted to the abduction and torture of its staffers.In their debriefing to Indian high commission officials, the two abducted staffers spoke extensively about their torture, the “scripted” confessions that they were forced to record on video and the threats that were hurled at them.Also Read: Beaten with rods, made to drink filthy water: 2 Indian staffers were tortured in Pak“The abductors, who we believe were from Pakistan’s ISI (Inter Services Intelligence), repeatedly told them this is the treatment that would be meted out to other mission officials as well in future,” a government source said.If the government of Pakistan cannot deliver on its commitment under the Vienna Convention to ensure the safety of Indian diplomats, Indian diplomats cannot possibly discharge their responsibilities. It would be natural, under the circumstances, to consider if India should scale down its presence to the bare essentials, a government source told Hindustan Times.Besides, Pakistan watchers in Delhi said Indian high commission officials could hardly move out of the mission due to fear that they would be picked up. In contrast, Pakistani officials in Delhi have been going around freely, some of them even tapping people for classified information. Two of them were expelled on May 31 for espionage.Since the strength of diplomatic missions are decided on a reciprocal basis, it would mean that Islamabad would also have to prune its strength in New Delhi if India pulls back some diplomats.Pakistan had last August downgraded diplomatic ties after India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and carved out two centrally-administered union territories. The missions of the two countries have since then been headed by a charge d’affaires, not a high commissioner.Officials said the line of questioning that the two staff members, both drivers, were subjected to while in custody of the ISI on Monday indicated that this may not be the last such incident. They were interrogated about the specific role and function of all high commission officials, down to the most junior staffers and tortured to confess that alleged intelligence officials at the commission would get them to bring people hidden in the cars for meetings in the commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/furious-at-torture-of-2-staffers-india-considers-reducing-mission-strength-in-pak/story-CaAfvJK4qCHd9EDe4jfKoM.html

16-06-2020||India||As migrants’ return slows down, Covid-19 cases decline in Bihar, UP, Jharkhand and MP||For the first time in the past one week, eastern and central states, which received most of the returning migrant workers, have witnessed a decline in the number of the cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since May 1, shows data.This has come as a big relief to the respective state governments amid fears that the returning migrants would push the Covid-19 cases in the regions and take the pandemic to rural areas, which has very poor health infrastructure as compared to urban places.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWhile state governments kept the returning workers in quarantine for a period ranging from seven to 21 days, officials said the declining trend was because of a fall in the number of migrants returning home in the first and second week of June. “The peak of returning migrant workers is over,” Lokesh Kumar Singh, Bihar’s health secretary, said.Singh’s comment sums up the situation in the states that received a large number of migrant workers and is corroborated by the figures of the railways ministry, which has reduced the operations of its Shramik Special trains from June 15 as the demand from the states went down. In Bihar, the number of Covid-19 cases increased to 6,581 on June 15 from 3,923 on June 1. Although the total number of cases had steadily increased, the pace has slowed down in the past few days, Singh said. As compared to about 12% increase in cases in the first week of June, there was 10.81% rise in the second week.According to Bihar’s public relations department, around 2.1 million workers have returned to the state since May 1, when the Shramik trains started, and of them, only 250,000 came during the first two weeks of June.“Most of the migrant workers who have arrived by Shramik Special trains to Bihar between May 3 and June 11 have completed their mandatory quarantine period,” Anupam Kumar, Bihar’s public relations secretary, said. As on Monday, Kumar said, only 6,082 workers were in quarantine centres and others were back in their homes after completing the 14-day mandatory isolation. He added that the state expects the cases to go down as very few workers are expected to return from this week onwards.The situation is no different in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh, where three million workers have returned since mid-April and which led to a spike in Covid-19 cases in eastern and western parts, the two regions, from where many people go for work to other states. After their return, almost half of them have been medically screened for Covid-19.The UP government’s health department data shows that the weekly average of the rise in the Covid-19 infections in the first week of June was 412 cases per day, which reduced to 356 cases per day in the second week.“Over 500 cases were reported on Saturday and Sunday because of the results of the pending test reports coming. Otherwise, the pace of increase in cases in on the downward trend,” Amit Mohan Prasad, the principal secretary of the health and family welfare, said. Prasad said health workers had screened 1.6 million migrants, who are under home quarantine, till June 14 and only 1,455 of them had symptoms of the disease. “Samples of those who had shown symptoms have been taken,” he said.The second week of Unlock 1 that began on June 1 has brought some reprieve for Jharkhand as well. There has been a declining trend in Covid-19 cases after 10 days of a steep spike as there was a substantial dip in the number of migrant workers returning. The pandemic peaked on June 8 when the state recorded the highest ever single-day spike of 187 new cases. It took a downward trend thereafter with 50 cases per day on average being reported in the last four days. From 610 cases on May 31, the state’s tally on June 15 had increased to 1,151. “The inflow of migrants was very high in May leading to a huge backlog of untested samples. As we cleared the backlog, there was a spike in cases,” Nitin Madan Kulkarni, the state health department’s principal secretary, said.“The inflow of migrants has substantially reduced in unlock-1 and we have seen a downward trend of Covid growth in the last four days,” he said. In Madhya Pradesh, another state with the high recipient of migrant workers, the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases has also slowed down. The number of new cases recorded has fallen from 1,424 in last week of May to 1,401 in the second week of June.And, the reason for this was just 54,282 workers returning in June as compared to over 3 lakh in May.“Out of these people 49,280 were home quarantined and remaining institutional quarantined,” said a rural development department official. Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the number of new cases is coming down was a positive sign and showed their strategy was working.(With inputs from Ranjan in Bhopal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-migrants-return-slows-down-covid-19-cases-decline-in-bihar-up-jharkhand-and-mp/story-lRDeEvkQcVU7DLsPvlLhHN.html
16-06-2020||India||Supreme Court notices to Centre, IRDA on plea seeking insurance cover for mental illness||The Supreme Court on Tuesday issued notices to the central government and Insurance Regulatory Development Authority (IRDA) on a plea seeking directions to insurance companies to provide medical insurance coverage for treatment of mental illness.The plea, filed by an advocate Gaurav Kumar Bansal, stated that insurance companies are refusing to provide such coverage despite a mandate under the Mental Healthcare Act of 2017.Section 21 (4) of the said act states that “every insurer shall make provision for medical insurance for treatment of mental illness on the same basis as is available for treatment of physical illness”.Based on that provision, the IRDA had issued a circular in August 2018 to the insurance companies to comply with the same but to no avail.The IRDA, however, has not taken any action against insurance companies for such violation, Bansal pointed out. “The inaction by IRDA is hampering the rehabilitation process of thousands of persons with mental Illness,” the petition said.A bench headed by Justice Rohinton Nariman sought response from IRDA and central government.The mental health issue is again being debated after the death of actor Sushant Singh Rajput.“Mental health needs to be addressed as a medical emergency. The shocking thing is that we lose young ones in such scenarios. The maximum number of suicide is happening in adolescence or early adulthood after which comes the old age population. We require a national helpline to prevent these things. We also require a great destigmatising programme of psychiatry. To tell the whole population of destigmatisation, we require a national policy,” said Dr Rajiv Mehta, Vice-Chairperson, Institute of Psychiatry and Behavioural Sciences, Sir Gangaram Hospital.“The fear and the stress at this time of Covid-19 pandemic have exposed the vulnerabilities of all individuals,” said Dr Manushree Gupta, Associate Professor, Department of Psychiatry VMMC (Vardhman Mahavir Medical College) and Safdarjung Hospital, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-notices-to-centre-irda-on-plea-seeking-insurance-cover-for-mental-illness/story-HEujUz31458YrsGa2hJyYO.html

Their sampling will be done on priority basis and tested accordingly,” Kulkarni said.The week-long exercise will cover both rural and urban households. “I would like to appeal to every citizen of the state to cooperate in the exercise so that the Covid-19 could be checked completely in the state,” he said.Also read: Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in hospital due to high fever, Covid-19 test todayHe said that the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has conducted sero-survey in 200 districts of the country to ascertain if there was any community transmission of coronavirus in any of the districts. The survey included three districts of Jharkhand-Pakur, Latehar and Simdega- where it found negligible possibility of community transmission in the three districts.“We have requested the ICMR to conduct sero-survey across the state so that we could know the actual status of transmission in the state. We hope the survey will be completed by the end of this month,” he said.The health secretary said Jharkhand witnessed a sudden growth in Covid-19 cases recently due to the influx of migrant workers from across the country.According to the state disaster management department, a total of 5,11,663 migrants workers have arrived in Jharkhand so far. As many as 4,12,357 have returned to Jharkhand on 238 special Shramik trains and buses.The health secretary said sampling of 78,423 migrant workers have been done so far, which is 15.16% of total migrant returnees. Till now, 1,477 migrants have been detected Covid-19 positive.The migrants, who are returning from Delhi, are carrying the highest Covid-19 positivity rate. Of the total Covid-19 positive cases among migrants workers, 2.83% cases are related to the migrants who returned from Delhi, while the same is 2.3% each for the workers returned from Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka.“Eighteen persons, who returned from Bangladesh, have been found positive for Covid-19,” the health secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-to-launch-mega-door-to-door-covid-19-identification-drive-from-june-18/story-dUaaMKwiSxza7KQGwV3dLJ.html
16-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What makes Centre-state relations different in national capital||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday said that the Centre’s decision to step in and help Delhi government combat the spiralling cases of Covid-19 infection in the national capital is a cooperative exercise rather than one where it has wrested control from the state.The party’s response has also been in sharp contrast to the political wrangling that erupted in the Opposition-ruled states of West Bengal and Maharashtra over their handling of the pandemic.A senior party functionary said the two governments are working together to address the situation instead of “trading blame”.According to party functionaries, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia’s statement made a week ago where he said that Covid-19 cases in the city are likely to reach 5.5 lakh by the end of July became the trigger for the central government to step in and steer the state’s response.“Sisodia’s statement was an indication that the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government seemed to have loosened its grip on the situation. When the home minister (Amit Shah) decided to help the state; it was a move where the centre stepped in without over-stepping,” said a second person aware of the details.Since Sunday, Shah has held several rounds of meetings and even inspected a government-run hospital.The bitterness that erupted between the Centre and the governments of West Bengal and Maharashtra when inter-ministerial central teams were deputed to spot assessment of the situation has been largely missing this time.Within hours of the team being announced, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee had questioned the Centre’s move. She also targeted Shah, claiming letters meant for the state government were released to the media before they reached the CMO (chief Minister’s Office).In Maharashtra, the ruling Shiv Sena, Congress and NCP combine has also blamed the BJP for politicising the issue. NCP’s Jayant Patil said if the BJP blames the Maharashtra government for the spread of virus in the state, should the Centre be blamed for the failure to check the spread of Covid-19 in the country.In contrast, following meetings with Shah, Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “Extremely productive meeting betn Del govt and Central govt. Many key decisions taken. We will fight against corona together.”Even as BJP state unit in Delhi has trained its guns on the Arvind Kejriwal government for not ramping up testing facilities and medical care infrastructure, the leadership has shown more restrain.On Monday, Shah, held another round of meetings, including one with all political party where the representatives reiterated the need to keep political differences aside to fight the pandemic.So what led the BJP to soften its stand against a political rival? “We have been demanding answers from the AAP government about the spending on medical infrastructure but there has been no response. We opposed the decision of not admitting people from outside Delhi to hospitals here; a decision that was reversed by the LG. It is not that the BJP has abdicated its duties as a responsible Opposition, but the challenge is such that we need to join forces to save lives,” said a Delhi state functionary.Commenting on the process of the political adversaries sitting across the table in Delhi to find a solution, Ajay Gudavarthy, professor of political science at Jawaharlal Nehru University said, “Modi-Shah working modality is geared towards election management. Bengal is due for election while in Delhi it’s over. We saw similar animosity towards Kejriwal before elections in Delhi. They also wish to create a perception that Mamta is aggressive and cannot work with the centre and in the process Bengal is losing out.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-makes-centre-state-relations-different-in-national-capital/story-DqA6Q9aFM4k9EK33MzbFpL.html

16-06-2020||India||‘Insensitive’: Sonia Gandhi slams fuel price hike during Covid-19 in letter to PM Modi||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to rollback the fuel price and pass on the benefit of reduced international crude oil rates to consumers, saying if “you want citizens to be self-reliant then do not place financial fetters on their ability to move forward”.In her letter, Gandhi also pointed the hike in excise duty of petrol and diesel has come at a time when the country is facing unprecedented public health, economic and social challenges during the ongoing battle against the Covid-19 pandemic.“I am deeply distressed that in these exceedingly difficult times since the beginning of March, the government has taken the wholly insensitive decision to increase petrol and diesel prices on no less than ten separate occasions,” she wrote.The letter came a day after former Congress president Rahul Gandhi criticised the government over the increase in petrol and diesel prices.Apart from demanding that the benefit of low international crude oil prices be passed on to the consumers, the Opposition party also wants the rates of petrol, diesel and LPG be reduced to the August 2004 level.The price of petrol then was Rs 36.81 per litre, diesel was sold at Rs 24.16 per litre and LPG Rs 261.60 per cylinder in Delhi, it said.Alleging that the government is earning out of the pockets of the poor by imposing high taxes on fuel, the Congress has also been demanding that petrol and diesel should be brought under the ambit of Goods and Services Tax (GST).“Your government is seeking to earn an additional revenue of nearly Rs 2,60,000 crore by these ill-advised hikes in excise duty and increases in the petrol of diesel. As it is, people across the board are facing unimaginable hardships what to say of widespread fear and insecurity,” the Congress chief said.“These price increases are saddling our people with an additional burden of this enormous magnitude that is neither justified nor appropriate. It is the duty and responsibility of the government to alleviate suffering, not put the people to still greater hardship,” she added.Gandhi questioned the “logic” behind such an increase at a time when the economic impact of Covid-19 is “depriving millions of jobs and livelihood, devastating business big and small, rapidly eroding the income” of the middle class, even as farmers are struggling to sow the crop for the Kharif season.Given that the international price of crude oil has fallen by approximate 9% over the last week (coming after a collapse of crude oil prices over the last few months), she said the government is doing “nothing short of profiteering off its people - when they are down and out”.Gandhi, who is also the chairperson of the Congress parliamentary party (CPP), further said it is a matter of record that despite historically low oil prices over the last six years your government’s revenues have been massively enriched by the cumulative increase in excise duty on petrol and diesel on twelve different occasions (by an additional Rs 23.78 per litre on petrol and Rs 28.37 on diesel). “This translates into a 258% increase in excise on petrol and 820% hike in excise duty on diesel yielding in these six years a staggering Rs 18,00,000 crore from excise collection on petrol and diesel alone. If ever there was ever a time to deploy these resources in the service of the people, it is now,” she said.Gandhi urged the Prime Minister to roll back these increases and pass on the benefit of low oil prices directly to the citizens of this country.“If you wish for them to be ‘self-reliant’ then do not place financial fetters on their ability to move forward. And I am once again obliged to repeat what I have said before: please use the government’s resources to put money directly into the hands of those who need it in this time of severe hardship,” she said.Petrol and disease prices were raised for the tenth day in a row on Tuesday by state-run oil marketing companies (OMCs) even as crude oil rates have come down to multi-year lows.The price of petrol was increased by 47 paise a litre on Monday while that of diesel by 57 paise a litre in Delhi. Petrol and diesel will now cost Rs 76.73/litre and Rs 75.19/litre respectively in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/insensitive-sonia-gandhi-slams-fuel-price-hike-during-covid-19-in-letter-to-pm-modi/story-fe3eF9naaxiiAbS2gm543L.html

These people either have type 2 diabetes or heart disease, the researchers said. The other diseases listed by the researchers include chronic kidney disease, chronic respiratory disease and a range of other chronic condition.According to the study, a little over 20 per cent of the population has an underlying condition.The study has been conducted by a team of experts from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The researchers took risk factors highlighted in official guidelines and used broad epidemiology data such as the Global Burden of Diseases study to arrive at their estimates.Regions with younger populations, such as Africa, present less risk overall despite some spots where the prevalence of HIV and AIDS is high, the authors said. Others like Europe, where average ages are higher and almost a third of people have at least one health condition, may be less resilient.Researchers said the findings could help governments make decisions on who receives a Covid-19 vaccine first when one becomes available.Meanwhile, India on Tuesday reported 10,667 new Covid-19 cases and 380 deaths in the last 24 hours (between Monday and Tuesday). The country’s tally stands at 3,43,091, according to the Union health ministry.

There are 50,567 active cases of the respiratory disease in the state.Tamil Nadu, which on Monday announced a lockdown from June 19 to 30 in its worst-affected districts, has reported 46,504 infections and 479 deaths till date. The number of those cure stands at 25,344.Its decision to announced the lockdown came after an expert panel warned the government that the state has hit its peak, but may witness another if strict measures aren’t followed.Delhi has 42,829 Covid-19 cases and reported 1,400 fatalities as Centre stepped up efforts to contain the spread and management of the infections in the national capital. In Gujarat, there are 24,055 infections so far and 1,505 deaths.The Centre wants states witnessing a large number of Covid-19 cases to keep the death rate, or the case fatality rate low. The emphasis on lowering death rates is in keeping with the government’s new strategy of not so much flattening the curve of infections, but living with the virus. Top government officials familiar with the thinking said that while aggressive testing, door-to-door surveys to track Covid-19 cases, and efforts to strengthen infrastructure will continue, there will be a renewed focus on keeping the death rate low. Prime Minister Narendra Modi may even raise the issue in his meeting with chief ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the wake of rapidly spreading coronavirus disease.The Prime Minister will hold a video conference with the heads of 21 states and Union territories, including Punjab, Kerala, Goa and northeastern states.

News agency PTI reported that forecast agencies have predicted slow advancement of monsoon this week.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted light rain in some places in the state but the heatwave is likely to prevail for at least the next 24 hours.On Monday, Delhi experienced a maximum temperature of 41.4 degrees Celsius, two notches above normal, and it is likely to remain above 40 degrees Celsius for the next three days before light rains bring some relief.In Punjab and Haryana, too, the day temperatures were above normal. Hisar in Haryana was the hottest place in the two states at 42.9 degrees Celsius, recording a two-degree increase above the normal.The Southwest Monsoon, which arrived in Kerala on its usual date on June 1, moved ahead because of a deep depression in the Arabian Sea which later turned into Cyclone Nisarga and hit the Maharashtra coast on June 3.It has now covered whole of Maharashtra and parts of Chhattisgarh and Gujarat.In fact, isolated areas in the suburbs of Mumbai in Maharashtra recorded moderate to heavy showers on Monday allowing the city to achieve 50 per cent of its average rainfall for the month of June.The weather bureau on Monday afternoon revised its orange alert for the city (heavy to very heavy rain) to a yellow alert (moderate to heavy rain) and has issued an orange alert for Tuesday and Wednesday.The monsoon has, meanwhile, further advanced to Kandla, Ahmedabad, Indore, Narsinghpur, Umaria and Balia, the IMD update at 8 am on Tuesday said. Rains are expected to continue in Gujarat, Diu, some parts of Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Odisha, West Bengal and Sikkim under the influence of East-West trough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-advances-but-heatwave-like-conditions-return-in-north-india-imd/story-P2dPaI4EYTIA1s6jO22FZN.html

They were blindfolded with a rucksack thrown over their heads and handcuffed, they added.The two staff members were then taken to an unknown location about 10 minutes from the place where they were picked up and interrogated for about six hours. They were repeatedly beaten with rods and wooden sticks and made to drink filthy water.Also Read: Furious at torture of 2 staffers, India considers reducing mission strength in PakGiving further details, the people said that the two Indian staffers were interrogated regarding the specific role and function of all high commission officials.Reports in the Pakistani media had claimed that the Indian officials had been arrested after their car allegedly hit a pedestrian near the diplomatic enclave. The Indian officials told Hindustan Times that their kidnappers made multiple videos in which these staffers were forced to confess under duress that they had committed an accident.They were also threated and told that this is how the other members of the high commission would be treated in the future, the officials said.The two men were handed back to the Indian high commission at around 9 pm. They were released after the Pakistani charge d’affaires in New Delhi was summoned to the foreign ministry for lodging a strong protest.Though they were able to walk, the people said that the two Indian staffers carried extensive injury marks to their neck, face and thighs indicating extensive manhandling.No life threatening injuries have been detected so far in their medical examination.A first information report (FIR) by Islamabad Police, accessed by HT, claimed fake Pakistani currency with a face value of Rs 10,000 was found in the car they were travelling in. These allegations were dismissed by the people cited above, who described them as false and baseless.The incident was widely seen in New Delhi as retaliation for the Indian government’s decision to expel two officials of the Pakistan high commission who were apprehended on charges of spying on May 31.India had expelled the two officials of the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi after they were detained by security agencies while trying to obtain classified materials on Indian security installations. Both men were declared “persona non grata for indulging in activities incompatible with their status as members of a diplomatic mission” and asked to India within 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/handcuffed-threatened-beaten-up-the-harrowing-12-hours-of-indian-mission-staffers-in-pak-detention/story-NrOqKInOAGB7PojA1mN5wK.html

According to the release, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said the supply of pulse oximeters at mohalla and colony level is being considered for the control of Covid-19 to make survey work easier. “It will prove to be of help to rush any person found with disease symptoms to the health centre immediately for treatment. The general public will be made partners in corona control along with the administration,” the release said quoting the chief minister.The chief minister said that order to make the general public aware of the importance of social distancing, conscious representatives will be selected from the public and given the responsibility. “In order to free our state, the country and the whole world from corona, collective efforts are must, so that all of us can live a normal life, I would like to say to the people of the state that even God helps those who help themselves,” Chouhan said.Faiz Ahmad Kidwai, the principal secretary of the health department, said the state government will enrol volunteers who will have the pulse oximeters to check the oxygen level of people during survey and screening in localities and colonies. “If oxygen level of any person is found below the prescribed level, the details of the person will be entered in an app by the volunteer in his mobile phone so that the person concerned could be treated immediately,” Kidwai said.“The government is working on details and modalities of the plan as to how to implement it in the best possible manner,” he added.In reply to a question, he said initially the facility would be available in urban areas of the state.Madhya Pradesh has 10,935 Covid-19 patients, out of whom 465 have died, so far, according to the state’s health department bulletin released on Monday night. Indore tops the chart with 4,069 patients and 174 deaths followed by Bhopal with 2,235 patients and 72 deaths and Ujjain with 801 patients and 66 deaths. Till now, 7,903 patients have recovered from the disease and been discharged from hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-mulls-pulse-oximeters-in-urban-areas-for-screening-covid-19-patients/story-kRp6HFPMHkAc6kE9K0RoZI.html
16-06-2020||India||3 killed in Odisha over witchcraft allegations||Three people, including a woman, were hacked to death and two were assaulted over suspicions of practising black magic in three districts in Odisha, police said on Monday.A 30-year-old man beheaded a woman in Mayurbhanj district before walking into the police station with the severed head and in Rayagada district, a man hacked two elderly people to death.Swarnalata Minz, Khunta police station inspector, said Budhuram Singh from Karakachia Nuasahi village of Mayurbhanj district killed his neighbour Champa Singh, 60, suspecting her to be responsible for the death of his young daughter last Wednesday. Champa was inside her house when Budhiram dragged her out and chopped her head with an axe. Later, he walked to the police station with the severed head and surrendered before the cops.Police in Rayagada district said Premananda Mandangi of Badakoshapad village under Seskhal Police station area of the district hacked his neighbours Jadumani Mandangi (45) and Poli Madangi (50). Both died on the spot.Premananda had earlier alleged that three of his family members were killed by Jadumani and Poli by performing black magic. A village meeting was held three months ago where Jadumani and Poli were asked to pay Rs 3,000 as a penalty for practising black magic. However, they didn’t pay the fine.The police arrested accused Premanand and seized the bodies of Jadumani and Poli after they were informed by the victims’ families.In a separate incident, an elderly man and his daughter were assaulted and forced to drink cow dung-laced water over suspicions of witchcraft in Balasore district.Police said Parshuram Barik, a 60-plus man from the district’s Nilagiri area, was assaulted by his neighbour and several other villagers after they suspected him to of practising black magic.They said after the daughter-in-law of Barik’s neighbour, Shantilata, fell ill, she called a witchdoctor to his home. The witchdoctor after conducting some rituals said Barik was casting a spell on her. Following this, other villagers tied him to a tree and assaulted him. When his daughter Puspanjali tried to save him, she was assaulted and both were forced to drink cow dung-laced water.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-killed-in-odisha-over-witchcraft-allegations/story-E1vykjX8eRORPcacm9sNGM.html

The main objective of the meeting, according to officials, is to keep the death rate, or the case fatality rate low. A detailed action plan for this purpose has already been chalked out, they added, and PM Modi may even raise the issue in his meeting with chief ministers.Click here to follow Covid-19 live updatesEven as India’s average death rate has remained low at 2.9 - the global average is 5.4% - the concern, the officials said, is that over 80% of the total deaths in the country are from just five states: Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh.“We have also noted with concern that 65 districts of India have more than 5% fatality rate. And the largest chunk, 19, of those districts are in Madhya Pradesh, followed by 11 in Gujarat and 10 each in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh,” said one of the officials who asked not to be identified.In Madhya Pradesh, Mandla, Sehore, Umaria and Chhindwara are among the districts; in UP, Lalitpur, Jhansi, Meerut and Agra; and in Maharashtra, Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Dhule, and Aurangabad.The situation in Delhi was already discussed in detail in a series of meetings held by Union home minister Amit Shah in the last two days. Apart from Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, he also met the mayors and other officials from Delhi to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the national capital.Shah also held an all-party meeting where leaders from different political parties offered solution to tackle to crisis.Meanwhile, India’s Covid-19 tally crossed 3.3 lakh on Monday and the death toll surpassed 9,500. These include nearly 1.53 active cases, as close to 1.7 lakh have recovered already to give a recovery rate of over 51 per cent, the health ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-hold-consultation-with-chief-ministers-beginning-today-on-covid-19-situation/story-ZF8QUwF5CY9uifbCY5TXtJ.html
16-06-2020||India||Activists condemn naming Mander in Delhi riots case charge sheets||A group of at least 160 prominent academics, activists, and artists from across the country issued a statement on Monday condemning the police for mentioning the name of social activist Harsh Mander in charge sheets pertaining to the February riots in north-east Delhi. They said Mander’s name was mentioned to concoct a “chronology” and create a false narrative about the riots. The chronology has been mentioned in at least three charge sheets, including the one against suspended councillor Tahir Hussain (one of the main accused in the riots). Quoting from the charge sheet, the group said under the head, “Brief Facts of the Case - Chronology Of Events Leading To Riots In North-East, Delhi (Point 17. Para 4)”, police wrote: ”Mr. Harsh Mander, who visited the site on 16/12/19 and instigated the protestors to not have faith in the Supreme Court and to fight their battle on road to get justice. He, however, used a façade of peace in a part of his speech.” The group said in a joint statement, “There cannot be anything more ridiculous than saying Harsh Mander used a “façade of peace. He has devoted his entire life to the cause of peace and harmony in society.” Among the 160 academics and activists were Abhijit Sen , former member of the Planning Commission, Achin Vanaik, retired professor of international relations, Delhi University, Admiral L Ramdas, Admiral Vishnu Bhagwat, Air Vice Marshal (retd) Kapil Kak, film-maker and actress Aparna Sen, and JNU professor Atul Sood.Police have not charged Mander in any case related to the riots but have explained in the charge sheet that the anti-CAA protests led to the north-east Delhi riots and that some of the leaders of the protests were actively behind the conspiracy of the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/activists-condemn-naming-mander-in-delhi-riots-case-charge-sheets/story-FmH39tJsFluxO7U0lvTOxJ.html
16-06-2020||India||A breakneck race to defeat the disease||The retraction of influential studies published in two of the world’s leading scientific journals last week was a rude reminder of the perils of moving at warp speed to find a treatment or cure for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has infected eight million and killed 430,000 in less than six months of the World Health Organisation (WHO)being informed by China about a cluster of pneumonia cases of unknown origin in Wuhan on December 31, 2019.By January 30, it had infected 7,818 people, of which 82 were in 18 other countries , which forced a seemingly reluctant WHO to declare the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV), as it was then called, a public health emergency of international concern. Scientists from across the world stepped up to defuse the emerging health threat with every tool that they had. Never before have so many scientists, researchers and clinicians from across specialties focused on a single disease or used such a wide variety of innovative techniques and platforms for vaccine and drug development. Never before have regulatory processes been fast-tracked at such scale for emergency use of drug and vaccine trials.“The need for speed should not throw caution to the wind. Dubious data sources and poorly designed clinical trials of experimental drugs and vaccines have raised more concerns than solutions,” said Sujatha Rao, a former health secretary of the ministry of health and family welfare. Need for speed As on June 12, the US National Library of Medicine Registry of ClinicalTrials.gov had 2,122 registered studies on the disease, with hundreds more registered in national registries. “When publication is going at a high speed, you don’t always notice the traffic signals. There are three things happening now. People are publishing through a rapid review process, studies are being published in pre-prints, people are writing blogs where they can write anything and interpret anything they call data. In the usual (scientific journal) publication cycle, nothing gets published in three or four days. From submission to publication, it normally takes at least three to four weeks and often more than six weeks. If I get an article for review from The Lancet, which I frequently do, I get a minimum of 10 days,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India.Pre-print publication is a practice borrowed from other sciences, such as physics and Math, where researchers put their papers on a website and invite comments from the scientist community, based on which they modify and correct their analysis before publication.What works for theoretical sciences, however, doesn’t work as well for medical research, which has immediate implications on health and life. “Rapid reviews are causing problems because the reviewers are chosen in haste and they don’t have adequate time to look at the data properly and they are under pressure to respond quickly,” said Reddy.Peer review is important to ensure quality of scientific communications, incorporating inputs of other experts. “While pre-publication peer-review is the standard, there are good examples of post-publication review as well. Validation by other researchers is perhaps the most important, especially when the findings are unexpected or controversial,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research- Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. Review, reform But this very validation process spectacularly failed in the case of the two retracted studies in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine. The Lancet paper raised safety concerns about the experimental use of the anti-malarial drugs for treatment and led to WHO suspending the hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine arm of its multi-country trial, much to the dismay of India, which is the world’s largest producer of these affordable generic drugs that have been used to treat malaria for close to a century. “The key concern for us was that the data was questionable that made analysis unreliable and any results misleading. If not for the name of the journal, the paper would have not have been taken as seriously,” said Agrawal.While journals have established validation processes, such papers can slip between the cracks because of several reasons, including the authors belonging to reputable institutions like Harvard University, or the reviewers having confirmation bias, where they agree with the study’s conclusion even before they begin scrutinising how the result has been arrived at.For a disease barely six months old, generating high-quality data quickly and efficiently is a challenge, which makes review and scrutiny all the more critical. “It’s the job of a journal’s editorial team to do an independent review and ensure it doesn’t get shoddy when it is inundated with research studies,” said Dr Jacob T John, former head of the department of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.Retractions are not rare, but they are growing. In 2019, there were 1,433 retractions from scientific journals, according to Retraction Watch, which has been tracking retractions for a decade. In 1997, the number was 44.Trial by error Vaccine development, on average, takes 10.71 years from the preclinical phase, and has a success rate of 6%, according to a study in the journal, PLOS One. Some remain elusive despite decades of massive investment, as we have seen in the case of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus that causes the Acquired Immuno Deficiency Syndrome, or AIDS.Work on a Covid-19 vaccine began on January 11, within a day of China sharing the genome of the new coronavirus that came to be called Sars-CoV-2. By June 12, there were 10 experimental vaccines in advanced stages of clinical trials and 115 in pre-clinical evaluation stages, according to WHO. Scientists are working across emerging technology platforms that have never been used for vaccine development before. Moderna’s mRNA-1273, which entered into clinical trials just 66 days after Sars-CoV-2 was first sequenced in China, showcases the potential for DNA- and RNA-based vaccines that use the messenger RNA (mRNA) platform to elicit an immune response against the virus.“If it is approved, it will be the first messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine against any disease in the world. We don’t fully know the effectiveness of mRNA vaccines as yet. However, there is high quality science and pre-clinical evidence for this fast and flexible platform for vaccine development. We will have to wait and see,” said Agrawal.Vaccine development includes at least three human trials to test their safety, dosage and the strength and duration of the protection they offer, followed by production, licensure, deployment of vaccines and plans for post-marketing surveillance. Many of these trials have been collapsed and merged to have a vaccine ready for use within the next six to eight months.“With Covid-19, the goal from the beginning has been to develop, test and manufacture a vaccine on a scale of hundreds of millions of doses within 12 to 18 months, so an unprecedented approach has been adopted. With promising preliminary preclinical and phase 1 data available, meticulously planned trials are needed to separate the contenders from pretenders. Since approvals are expected for an emergency use vaccine, developers start mass manufacturing as soon as they complete phase 2 trials, and in doing so, risk the failure of phase 3. In such cases, consortiums and countries fund for risk reduction and provide market commitments,” said Dr N K Ganguly, former director general, Indian Council of Medical Research. This is where new technology lab-based platforms help. RNA- and DNA-based vaccines are faster and cheaper to produce than synthetic vaccines as they involve synthetic production of the genetic material, and not the virus. “The production is lab-based, so it can be quickly standardised and scaled up,” said Ganguly.Getting a large enough sample size across age groups is essential as the results in one population might not translate to the other. “Whether it is vaccines or drug development, what is crucial is independent scientific validation to ensure the vaccines and drugs are safe and effective because getting it wrong would mean playing with lives,” said Ganguly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-breakneck-race-to-defeat-the-disease/story-BqQWfheUwM7GNDVAPFVTXL.html

He is the nephew of former Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) legislator Zaffar Manhas, who has now joined the Apni Party led by Altaf Bukhari. The other two terrorists, sources added, have been identified as Zubair and Muneeb ul Islam. Both of them were from Shopian district.An army spokesperson said two AK-47 assault rifles and one INSAS rifle have been recovered from the encounter site, which is 400 to 500 metres away from the force’s Rashtriya Rifles camp.As many as 22 terrorists have been killed in the encounters that have taken place in south Kashmir’s Shopian district so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/encounter-breaks-out-in-jammu-and-kashmir-s-shopian/story-4ZI4oODR9p84GPR0KH4OTM.html

She somehow managed to reach the New Delhi railway station where she came across two to three men who promised to help her board a train to Jharkhand. They allegedly led her out of the station and took her to an unknown location where they forced her to drink alcohol and allegedly raped her.“Since the girl was intoxicated at that time and is not aware of the topography of the region, she is unable to help us with details of the crime spot,” said the officer. The men abandoned the girl, who walked for the next few hours, before a policeman noticed her disoriented condition and brought her to the Kotwali police station. “Our women officers interacted with her to get to know about the crime. The survivor was fed and medically examined,” said the officer.The survivor has been handed over to the Child Welfare Committee. Senior police officers authorised to speak to the media refused to comment.Police have registered a case of gang rape and under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/16-year-old-raped-by-men-on-pretext-of-helping-board-train/story-dS5eiQGokE22ogs8vXGCRL.html

The coming months will see dedicated efforts in that direction,” he told the third annual conference of PoEs.As of late last week, more than 29,000 Indian workers and more than 11,200 professionals have returned from across the world under the Vande Bharat Mission. Several thousands of Indians have lost their jobs, mainly in West Asia, because of the economic fallout of the pandemic.The government has also given priority to the welfare and protection of Indians working in west and southeast Asia and has taken all steps to reduce their vulnerabilities, Jaishankar said.“Nevertheless, there are still cases of cheating, illegal agents and attempts to go for work in an irregular manner. The role of our PoEs in combating such practices is vital…We have all put in great efforts to secure the interests of the most vulnerable migrants, especially blue-collar workers, seamen and women migrants.” The e-Migrate system helps ensure the rights and protection of workers in collaboration with host governments and the integration of this platform with those of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, other GCC countries and Malaysia will facilitate these efforts, he said.The government has established three new offices of PoEs, taking the total to 13 and extending the reach to areas that provide migrant flows to foreign countries. It has also liberalised usage of the Indian Community Welfare Fund to provide welfare measures to Indians in distress overseas.“This has had a particular relevance as we responded to the economic distress caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.

16-06-2020||India||Covid-19 fuelling mother and child mortality rates||Priyanshi Kol was born in her parent’s one-room hutment in Ansara village in the Rewa district of Madhya Pradesh on May 21 because her mother Shivjanki, 26, couldn’t get an ambulance to reach Sanjay Gandhi Medical Hospital 100 km away.She died on June 13 from childbirth-related complications. She was 23 days old.Priyanshi was a so-called low-birth baby, weighing 2 kg at birth against the healthy birth weight of 2.5 kg or more.“When the ambulance didn’t arrive, women got together and delivered the baby at home. Within days, the umbilical cord started bleeding and we called for an ambulance, which didn’t come. We spent Rs 4,000 to take her to the district hospital on May 27, but brought her home because the doctors were busy with (the) corona(virus disease) and didn’t have time for us,” said her father Mithilesh Kor, who is a daily-wage worker.His baby girl developed fever again and when the ambulance didn’t reach them for the third time in three weeks, the Kors took her to Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital again, where she died. “My son Piyush was born in a hospital, and he is safe. She would have lived if she had got treated,” said an inconsolable Shivjanki.“Institutional deliveries have fallen from around 75% to less than 25% in the districts we work in. Since Integrated Child Development Services were suspended on March 15, nutrition and immunisation services have take a huge hit and community health workers stopped visiting homes to immunise children because they are doing coronavirus-related work. District -level surveys show 50% children and 75% pregnant women being deprived of essential nutrition in the state,” said Sachin Jain, state coordinator of the Bhopal-based non-profit, Vikas Sansad Samiti, which works on issues related to hunger and maternal and child health in the state’s most underserved and largely tribal districts, such as Rewa, Shivpuri, Rewari, Panna, and Shivpuri. Around 80.8% births in Madhya Pradesh took place in hospitals in 2015-16, according to the National Family Health Survey-4, compared to the national average of 78.9%. State-level data on institutional births since March is not available.Falling immunisationAs public and private health systems across India geared up to respond to coronavirus disease (Covid-19), they inadvertently did so at the expense of other critical public health services. This threatens to lead to a parallel explosion in illness and deaths from other preventable and treatable diseases, which will raise all-cause deaths across ages, say experts.Adding to the crisis is missing data. With states busy fire-fighting Covid-19, routine disease surveillance has been hit, creating huge gaps in data on outbreaks.The Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), which is tasked with tracking outbreaks ranging from seasonal influenza H1N1 to child-killers like diarrhoea, chicken pox and measles, is busy tracking Covid-19 and hasn’t updated its live weekly outbreak dashboard since the end of February. The National Vector-Borne Disease Control Programme, which tracks malaria, chikungunya and dengue, among others, hasn’t received state reports since March.Routine immunisation is floundering, but it’s difficult to assess the damage in the absence of data. “States haven’t sent immunisation data since the lockdown, but anecdotal evidence indicates there’s been a sharp drop. We have asked states that suspended services to organise catch-up vaccinations drives as soon as possible, with districts with high infant and child mortality, where communities are completely dependent on government services,” said Dr Pradeep Haldar, deputy commissioner, immunisation division, ministry of health and family welfare.One in five of the world’s 5.9 million under-5 deaths take place in India, with more than half being from vaccine-preventable and treatable infections, such as pneumonia, diarrhoea and sepsis. If all children are vaccinated after birth, more than half these lives could be saved.But children like Priyanshi who are born at home also miss three vaccines given at birth -- BCG against childhood tuberculosis, oral polio vaccine, and the first doses of hepatitis B vaccine that protects against liver infection and cirrhosis. Many others, like her two-year-old brother Piyush, who got immunised at birth have missed booster vaccines since March, which could lead to a resurgence of potentially fatal diseases, such as childhood pneumonia, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), hepatitis B and diarrhoea.This threatens to reverse the gains India has made by immunising children against vaccine-preventing illnesses to bring down its infant mortality rate (IMR) to 32 per 1,000 live births in 2018, from 129 in 1971, according to the Sample Registration System (SRS) data released in June 2019.“During the monsoons, there is a rise in malaria and vaccine-preventable diarrhoea, pneumonia and measles, which are the biggest cause of under-5 deaths in India. If childhood vaccines are missed, IMR, malnutrition and stunting will rise and prevent India from meeting its Sustainable Development Goal of bringing IMR down to 25 or less by 2030,” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director, Public Health foundation of India Gandhinagar, Gujarat.Unsafe births, unsafe abortionsCovid-19 has also reduced access to contraception and abortion services, which is likely to lead to an increase in unwanted pregnancies and unsafe abortions. “The first four months of Covid-19, we estimate that access to 1.85 million abortions was compromised. This is around 47% of the estimated 3.9 million abortions that would have taken place in this period under normal circumstances,” said Vinoj Manning, chief executive officer, Ipas Development Foundation, a non-profit that promotes safe abortion services in India.Of the estimated 15.6 million annual abortions in India, 73% are through medical abortion pills that can be bought in pharmacies, 16% are in private health facilities, 6% in public health centres, and 5% through traditional unsafe methods, according to the first large-scale study on unintended pregnancies published in The Lancet in 2017.“Since medical abortions must be done within 12 weeks of pregnancy (first trimester), the restricted movement and services would have resulted in many pregnant women moving to the second trimester during the lockdown. Very few clinics and hospitals offers abortion services beyond 12 weeks, and the fear of Covid-19 is keeping women away from the ones that do. Add to that the out-of-pocket cost of visiting a hospital at a time of job loss and reduced income, and we find many women being forced to continue an unwanted pregnancy or seeking illegal and unsafe abortion services,” said Manning.An estimated 48% of all pregnancies are unintended because women don’t have information about safe sex or don’t have access to contraceptives, according to study published The Lancet study. Abortion is legal in India, but three unsafe abortions are performed for every two safe ones because 70% abortion clinics are in urban India, while 70% women live in rural areas, the study found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-fuelling-mother-and-child-mortality-rates/story-NvmX3Cn7KMqlff77R9BoZN.html

In addition to R Harikumar’s employees, the special flight, run by Air Arabia also carried 50 people from Kerala who lost their jobs in Sharjah and were desperate to get back home. “ It is my duty to protect my employees who stood with me though thick and thin,” said Harikumar, who is also a popular theatre artist. He came to Saudi Arabia from Alappuzha in Kerala, in search of a job 20 years ago and went on to become a successful businessman. His Elite group of companies makes aluminium extrusions in demand in the architectural sector and employs around 1200 people. He hails from the coastal town Alappuzha. “A good business firm is like a family. If employees are in trouble it is the duty of the firm to look after them,” he said, adding that he will help more Indians who have been stranded in the country due to Covid-19 restrictions return home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nri-businessman-charters-flight-for-employees-return/story-9Uw1gvvgAEc38FQLxpNF5O.html
16-06-2020||India||Amid row, Nepal plans increase in border posts||Nepal plans to increase the number of its border outposts (BoPs) along the boundary with India by 100, from the existing 121 to 221 in the next year, in a move that, while it has been in the works for some time, comes at a time when friction between the two countries is high over a new map approved by the Himalayan country’s parliament that lays claim to territory that has always been with India.The idea is to eventually take this number up to 500, people familiar with the matter said. The Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), which guards India’s borders with Nepal, and India’s central intelligence agencies have information that Nepal’s Armed Police Force (APF), deployed at the border, has already been given approval for an additional 100 border posts by that country’s home ministry. A proposal for taking this number to 500 is under consideration, a top government official said on condition of anonymity. Kedar Nath Sharma, joint secretary and spokesperson at Nepal’s ministry of home affairs, confirmed the immediate plan in a phone interview from Kathmandu.“Yes, we are going to increase the number of BoPs at the Indo-Nepal border from the existing 121 to 221 in the next Nepali fiscal year. I cannot say anything about the further plans”. The next Nepali fiscal year is from July 16, 2020 to July 15, 2021.A senior Nepal APF officer who asked not to be named said over the phone that the country is increasing the number of outposts to “keep a check on border crimes and to make sure unauthorised persons do not enter the country”. Interestingly, some of the outposts are around Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura, three of the territories Nepal now claims are its.On Saturday, Nepal’s parliament voted unanimously to amend its constitution to redraw the country’s political map laying claim over the strategically key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura.India has termed the decision “untenable” and in violation of current understanding to hold talks on outstanding border issues. Queries sent to the ministry of external affairs (MEA) and ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Nepal’s plans for new outposts remained unanswered.Experts are divided on the development, with some saying that erection of more outposts should not be a cause of concern as India and Nepal have a very good working relationship and there has never been a dispute between APF and SSB.Others believe the move is badly timed, given the current situation in the relationship between the two countries. Those subscribing to the first school of thought said India has 533 BoPs of SSB at the 1,751km-long open border with Nepal, and argued that Nepal’s APF, too, has a right to erect as many posts it wants. A senior SSB officer, who didn’t want to be named, said: “We (SSB and Nepal APF) guarding forces have a mechanism where commanding officers interact on regular basis, information is shared on network of criminals, human traffickers, counterfeit currency and drugs smugglers and even movement of terrorists.”In a one-off incident, Nepal APF fired upon a group of Indian villagers who had entered Nepal in violation of the lockdown underway there, near Sitamarhi (Bihar), killing one person and injuring two. The director general of SSB, Kumar Rajesh Chandra, didn’t respond to phone calls or texts seeking a comment. “It is in the interest of both countries that the open border between India and Nepal is not used by hostile elements whether for smuggling or trafficking in counterfeit currency or terrorist infiltration. For this, if Nepal APF wants to increase their presence and works in coordination with the SSB, which also has more than 500 BoPs, then I think it is a positive development,” Rakesh Sood, former ambassador to Nepal, said. But the timing is bad, said another former diplomat.Manjeev Puri, who has served as ambassador in Nepal, said: “India has reacted to Nepal laying claim to Indian territory in a new map in a firm but diplomatic manner, making clear that what the Nepalese have done is untenable. Nepal’s decision to add more BoPs on their side at this time should not have been done as it adds to an avoidable narrative of escalating tensions. India and Nepal have long-standing people-to-people relations, which need to be strengthened, especially during these unprecedented times of Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-row-nepal-plans-increase-in-border-posts/story-dYc6QMuJumgl8tQngnR8KO.html
16-06-2020||India||Milk turns sour as sales tank in season of glut||Households consumed more milk, cheese and yogurt during the lockdown, raising sales by up to 25% in large dairies, such as Amul. But that has not been enough to offset the sharp decline in demand from commercial buyers, such as hotels, confectioners and restaurants, which account for nearly 20% of the organised dairy sector’s revenues. This has triggered an inventory build-up crisis. This year should have been a bright one. Good rains during winter made for cheaper fodder, the key input for cattle. As a result, the flush season (typically from October to March), which sees higher milk output production, stretched into April and May, leading to a two-month oversupply. A limping hospitality sector, however, has cut sales in the last two months, analysts say. Revenue from ice-cream, cheese, flavoured milk, curd and yoghurt, among other items, which give higher profits than liquid milk, have tanked. Processed dairy items make up a third of the organised dairy sector’s revenues. The effects of a revenue crisis in larger dairies ultimately ripple into smaller ones, who, on cue, pass on lower prices to unorganised farmers.India is the largest producer of milk in the world. In the past four years, output has grown by over 6% every year. Production is expected to be 177 million tonnes in 2019-20. Nearly 70 million rural households are occupied in dairy farming, which gives a regular income, unlike the seasonal earnings from crops. From a dairy owner’s perspective, the more lucrative sales come from what is internally called the ‘Horeca’ segment, an industry acronym for ‘hotel, restaurant and canteen’ sales. “Dairies in which commercial sales to the hospitality sector have a larger share have taken a larger hit of the lockdown,” said Abhishek Agrawal of Comtrade, a commodities trading firm. Inventories could rise by 14% in the first quarter, which is usually a peak season, according to Crisil Ratings, the credit ratings firm. Amul, the country’s largest milk brand, said its value-added segment, such as ice-cream, yogurt and cream, account for 20% of overall sales. “During the two months of lockdown, sales in this segment became zero. They have now revived a little, say about 15%,” said RS Sodhi, the managing director of Amul, a brand owned by the Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation Ltd (GCMMF). Amul has been lucky because household sales have just about made up for falls in hospitality and commercial sales. The brand’s owner, GCMMF, said it has not reduced procurement prices ,ie, prices the dairy pays to farmers. However, thousands of unorganised, smaller farmers are already counting huge losses in states such as Punjab and Madhya Pradesh. In Madhya Pradesh, cooperatives have slashed wholesale milk prices to dairy farmers from ~7 a litre of milk to ~5.20, squeezing margins, said Kedar Sirohi, an Indore-based farm leader. “Small farmers who sell lower volumes have gone out of business,” he said.In April, there were reports of farmers from Kerala and Karnataka dumping milk on to roads because they were being offered too little for it.Analysts say a year of pain lies ahead. Demand of processed items are expected to “de-grow” 2-3% this fiscal year, according to Rahul Guha, a dairy business watcher and a director at Crisil Ratings. “That would reduce operating profitability by as much as 50-75 basis points.” One basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/milk-turns-sour-as-sales-tank-in-season-of-glut/story-tNzg43Uy9DO383DwAKRlGL.html
16-06-2020||India||Daily tests to climb to 18,000 as Amit Shah holds all-party meet||Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday urged all parties in Delhi to work together to stop the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from stalking the city, and discussed plans to ramp up testing to 18,000 by June 20, even as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal denied there were plans to reimpose a complete lockdown . Shah chaired an all-party meet to discuss augmenting the Capital’s health care infrastructure, a day after the senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader held separate meetings with Kejriwal and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal to chalk out a road map to tackle the pandemic.Leaders of the BJP, which is in power at the Centre, and Delhi’s ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) resolved to bury political differences in the battle against the outbreak, with Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta and the AAP’s Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh saying the number of daily tests will be increased to 18,000 by the end of the week.Fewer samples have been tested for Covid-19 in Delhi over the past few days, with the number falling from an average of about 7,000 samples at the end of May to about 5,000 samples last week. Baijal recently issued an order that struck down the Delhi government’s decision to keep high-risk asymptomatic people out of the scope of testing in Delhi.Another order by the Delhi L-G last week overturned Kejriwal’s announcement to reserve beds in private and state government hospitals for local residents, a move that was seen as a potential flashpoint between the Centre and the Delhi government.“Political differences must be forgotten and all parties must work together for the people of Delhi. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, we should all work together to fight this pandemic,” Shah said after Monday’s meeting.“Political unity will create confidence among the public and lead to improvement in the pandemic situation in the Capital. We have to improve Covid-19 testing capacity with newer techniques,” he added. Shah also asked the parties to mobilise their cadres and assist in implementing the decisions taken by the Centre and Delhi government.While AAP MP Singh said all parties decided to keep politics aside, Gupta added that a central team will give a report on the capping of charges at private hospitals, following which action will be taken to control “arbitrary” pricing. The Congress and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) also attended the meeting, which was held at the North Block.On Sunday, the home minister announced a series of steps that included aggressive testing and the formation of two committees, aimed at augmenting health care infrastructure, possibly capping treatment costs in private hospitals, and effective containment of Covid-19 in the national capital.The developments come ahead of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s consultations with chief ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday on ways to control the spread of the virus as India gradually exits a national lockdown necessitated by the outbreak.Delhi recorded 1,647 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the tally to about 43,000, while the death toll mounted to 1,400. Even as the number of daily cases remained high, Kejriwal rejected speculation that the Capital will return to a complete lockdown to slow the spread of the infectious disease, which has so far killed about 9,500 people in India.“Many people are speculating whether another lockdown in Delhi in being planned. There are no such plans,” the Delhi CM tweeted.The Delhi CM’s assertion came on a day the Tamil Nadu government announced that a lockdown will be reimposed from Friday on about 15 million people in Chennai and neighbouring districts. The state is the second worst-affected hot spot of the pathogen after Maharashtra.Speaking to reporters after the all-party meeting in Delhi, Singh said that a Covid-19 test which will cost around ~450 was being considered for the Capital. “It has been decided that 1,900 beds in state government hospitals, 2,000 beds in central government hospitals and 1,078 beds in private hospitals will be added for Covid-19 patients,” he said.Singh added that 500 train coaches that will act as isolation wards will be provided by the Indian Railways for 8,000 patients. The number of coaches will be increased to 1,000 in the coming days, taking the capacity to 16,000 Covid-19 patients, he added.The AAP government has issued directions to ramp up Delhi’s hospital bed capacity by 20,000 by June 20. Chief minister Kejriwal recently said Delhi will need 150,000 Covid-19 beds by July 31, factoring in outstation patients who may travel to the city for treatment.Newly appointed Delhi BJP chief Gupta said Shah discussed door-to-door tracing and mapping of risk in all containment zones of Delhi. “The BJP demanded that 50% charges be waived off on testing. This demand has been approved by Union home minister Amit Shah,” he said. A meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority is scheduled on June 16, where this issue is likely to be discussed. “In this hour of crisis, we should fight against the pandemic together instead of trading charges,” the Delhi BJP chief said after the meeting.In Telangana, the cost of conducting a Covid-19 test at private labs was fixed at ~2,200 on Monday and the fee for treatment of the disease in corporate hospitals at ~4,000 per day. The charge for treatment of patients in intensive care units without ventilator support was fixed at ~7,500 per day, while it would be ~9,000 per day for those who are on such support.Delhi Congress president Anil Chaudhary said he raised the issue of surging numbers of Covid-19 patients in Delhi, holding the BJP-ruled Centre and the AAP government in Delhi responsible for it. “The meeting was an exercise in mutual praise by both the BJP and the Aam Aadmi Party, though both the Central and Delhi governments have failed miserably in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic. This meeting should have been held 84 days ago, on March 23 when the lockdown was implemented,” he said.Shortly after the meeting at the Union home ministry, Shah visited the LNJP Hospital to review the Covid-19 preparedness. He met senior doctors, who briefed him about the number of patients treated at the facility, fatalities and admissions from outside Delhi.The Union home minister directed the Delhi chief secretary to install CCTV cameras in Covid-19 wards of every designated hospital in the national capital for proper monitoring, and set up alternative canteens for uninterrupted supply of food to the patients.“The Union minister interacted with doctors and medical staff and motivated them. He scrutinised the infrastructure and medical facilities in the hospital. For the last 10 days, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been taking stock of all arrangements in LNJP Hospital. He has been monitoring all the grievances and issues highlighted and ensured that they are resolved immediately. Today’s successful visit of the Union minister was an endorsement of the better facilities in LNJP Hospital,” a spokesperson of the Delhi government said. The Delhi government has directed all laboratories and hospitals to work at full capacity and ramp up Covid-19 testing capacity. In an order issued on Sunday, Delhi health secretary Padmini Singla called for the processing of all samples within 48 hours. “There is no upper limit to send samples to private sector labs, provided they undertake to process the same within the stipulated time frame, that is 24 hours (preferably) and maximum within 48 hours,” the order said. On Monday, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said laboratory facilities under the Centre in the national capital were also being extended to the Delhi government. “As far as increasing of testing capacity is concerned, in Delhi most of the lab facilities are under the Centre, so those are being extended to us,” he said.Sanjay Kumar, director at the Centre for the Study of Developing Societies, said: “There is a great deal of politics happening right now in Delhi over Covid-19, which ideally shouldn’t happen.” (With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-tests-to-climb-to-18-000-as-shah-holds-all-party-meet/story-LhXJ7mAaB0CRfFxqnzVJFM.html
16-06-2020||India||GST revenue fell 56% in April-May||The Goods and Services Tax (GST) collection and the consumption of diesel – the two weathervanes of economic health – fell by 56% and 42%, respectively in the first two months of the current financial year compared to same period a year ago due to the nationwide lockdown.Total GST collection in the first two months of FY-21 was Rs 94,323 crore, less than half of Rs 2,14,154 crore collected in the corresponding period of FY-20, according to a government document reviewed by HT.A sharp fall in GST collections in April and May was expected because of the nationwide lockdown since March 25 that disrupted economic activities, but the economy is recovering as the GST collection improved significantly in May compared to the previous month, a government official said requesting anonymity. GST, a tax on consumption, which fell by about 72% at Rs 32,172 crore in April this year, recovered substantially the following month to Rs 62,151 crore. However, the collection was about 38% short of Rs 1,00,289 crore collected in May 2019. India went through a four-phased lockdown between March 25 and May 31. The Indian economy has been hit hard by the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown, and this was also reflected in a sharp fall in diesel consumption. The trend is more or less in the lines of GST collection figures as both represent the intensity of business activities, the official said.Spokespersons at ministries of finance and petroleum did not respond to queries.Diesel consumption saw a 55.6% fall in April 2020 at 32,50,000 metric tonnes compared to 73,23,000 metric tonnes in the same month last year, according to the oil ministry’s datakeeper Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC). “The drop would have been sharper, but sustained rural demand arrested the fall to some extent in the [Rabi, winter crop ] harvest season,” the official said.Sector-specific relaxation saw some recovery in diesel demand in May, he said. The diesel consumption in May was 54,95,000 metric tonnes compared to 77,88,000 metric tonnes in May 2019, a fall to 29.4%.Experts are hopeful that GST collections will rise and diesel consumption , recover in coming months as most economic activities have now been permitted.Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consultancy firm EY said, “The fall in GST collections can be attributed to two main reasons, one is the muted economic activity in April and May due to Covid and the lockdown, and the other is the deferral of GST payment dates because of which some GST collections have been deferred. The fall in consumption of diesel and petrol seems largely on account of Covid and lockdown.”Anupam Manur, assistant professor at Takshashila Institution said, “The lockdown allowed the production, distribution and sale of only essential items, a lot of which (including agricultural products) do not attract a tax. The severe restrictions placed on the movement of people and vehicles and the resultant empty streets explains the fall in diesel consumption.”“Both the GST collections and diesel/petrol consumption should witness an uptick with lockdown being relaxed and the pickup in economic activity,” Jain said.Manur, however, said the recovery of diesel consumptions will be far quicker than that of GST collections. “With many of the strictest rules of the lockdown lifted and movement of people and travel allowed, demand for fuel will increase.”“Recovery of GST collections is a lot more complex and will depend on India’s ability to mend broken supply chains, restore people’s incomes and jobs, and increase consumer confidence, which will, in turn, greatly depend on how quickly we can contain the growth rate of Covid cases,” he added.According to the latest official data, the Indian economy grew 3.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2020. The growth rate in the full financial year 2019-20 is expected to be 4.2%, the slowest in 11 years on the back of falling investment and consumption.The slowdown is also reflected in automobile sales. According to a report published in HT on June 12, retail sales of passenger vehicles plunged 87% in May from a year earlier to 30,749 units. The country’s factory output also contracted by a record 55.5% in April, official data released on Friday said.According to global rating agencies, the next financial year appears promising for India. S&P Global Ratings on June 10 said India’s economy is likely to achieve a strong 8.5% growth in fiscal 2020 following a 5% contraction in the current fiscal year. The same day, Fitch Ratings projected a 5% contraction in the GDP this financial year, but said it expected growth to rebound to 9.5% in the next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gst-revenue-fell-56-in-april-may/story-E9dDKDTxL1BLcM1nWdMcAM.html
16-06-2020||India||ICMR advises rapid antigen kits for speedier diagnoses||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Monday validated the first point of care rapid antigen diagnostic test for Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) that gives results in 30 minutes as compared to the five hours taken by a conventional reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test -- making it easier for government health departments to test widely and quickly, and hospitals to screen non-Covid patients being admitted, especially for surgeries. The test , the world’s first rapid test , can be used in field settings in containment zones, hotspots and hospitals, and its findings do not need to be confirmed through an RT-PCR test.The kit— Standard Q COVID-19 Ag detection kit—has been developed by SD Biosensor, a South Korean company and jointly validated by ICMR and All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. The Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation has approved its import and manufacturing in the country.The company is yet to begin mass production of these kits in India.“We have just got ICMR validation so production will take some time. We will start manufacturing, may be around next week but the date has not been finalized yet. The price has also not been decided as yet but it will be much cheaper than RT-PCR kits,” said Punit Kumar, deputy manager, regulatory affairs, at SD Bio Sensor. “…Such tests would help in proper implementation of the Govt. strategy to test, track and treat. Such tests will also help in allaying the anxiety and fear of health care workers and aid in better clinical management of the patients…,” said ICMR in a statement.“We have issued an advisory to the states that it can be used for diagnosis of Sars-Cov-2 and test results that return positive using this antigen based test don’t require re-confirmation through RT-PCR. States can procure the kit and use it. ICMR has provided the broad guidelines and the rest is up to the states to see how well it can be deployed on ground,” said Dr Lokesh Sharma, scientist and spokesperson, ICMR.Sensitivity of the test (ability to detect true positives; which means the chances that an infected person will test positive) is 84%, depending upon the viral load of the patient wherein higher viral load correlates with higher sensitivity.ICMR has advised states to use this kit for Covid-19 diagnosis in containment zones, hotspots, and hospitals to test all symptomatic Influenza Like Illness (ILI), asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts with co-morbidities, and asymptomatic high risk patients who are hospitalized or seeking hospitalization such as those undergoing chemotherapy, immunosuppressed patients including HIV positives, suffering from a malignancy, transplant patients and elder patients with co-morbidities.The test has also been allowed in asymptomatic patients undergoing aerosol generating surgical or non-surgical interventions such as neurosurgery, ear nose throat surgery, dental procedures, bronchoscopy (lungs examination by putting a tiny camera inside), Upper gastro-intestinal endoscopy (digestive track examination by putting a tiny camera inside) and dialysis.RT-PCR tests are the gold standard frontline test for diagnosis of Covid-19, but “…require specialized laboratory facilities in terms of equipment, biosafety and biosecurity. Minimum time taken… 2-5 hours including the time taken for sample transportation. These specifications limit the widespread use of the RT-PCR test and also impede quick augmentation of testing capacity in various containment zones and hospital settings,” added the ICMR advisory.“It can be used for diagnosis but if the test is negative, RT-PCR will be done to rule out infection,” said Dr RR Gangakhedkar, head, epidemiology, ICMR.Hospitals say it is only after they start testing that they will be able to determine how beneficial this test is.“On face value, it does sound good to us as we are allowed to test in-patients and patients before admission, but then we will have to see how it helps us in our set-up of diagnosis. That we will come to know only when we start testing,” said Dr Chand Wattal, chairman, clinical microbiology and immunology, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.ICMR has asked other manufacturers and developers, who have antigen detection assays, to come forward for validation.“Currently, there is just one manufacturer but we are hoping many will come forward so that this testing can be expanded in states,” said Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-advises-rapid-antigen-kits-for-speedier-diagnoses/story-PEcxZEDwxrQpQC2aLv8aBL.html
16-06-2020||India||Airlines can fill up middle seats but must follow SOP, says Bombay HC||MumbaiThe Bombay high court (HC) on Monday allowed all airlines to fill the middle seats provided the guidelines issued by Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on May 31 and all other standard operating procedures (SOPs) issued by civil aviation authorities are strictly adhered to. The court passed its order in a petition filed by an Air India pilot who complained that the national carrier had risked the safety of passengers in Vande Bharat special evacuation flights and alleged that the airline had not adhered to a March 23 circular of DGCA which stipulated that the middle seat should be kept vacant to maintain social distancing among passengers. DGCA had, however, withdrawn the said circular and issued a new circular on May 31 stating the middle seats could be filled given the passenger was provided with proper personal protective equipment (PPE) which includes face mask, face shield, wrap around gown and gloves.On Monday, a bench of justice SJ Kathawalla while hearing the petition was informed by DGCA and ministry of civil aviation that they had issued necessary instructions for both international and domestic airlines to protect passengers from contracting Covid-19 in its May 31 circular. The guidelines stated that the middle seats, which were to be kept vacant as per an earlier circular of March 23, could be filled up provided the airlines followed all SOPs and provided PPE to the passenger occupying the middle seat.The airline, namely Air India, represented by solicitor general of India Tushar Mehta, advocate Dr Abhinav Chandrachud, advocates Arsh Misra and Kavitra Anchan informed the court that they would ensure that the May 31 circular and SOPs issued by various aviation authorities would be adhered to and urged that the petition be dismissed with costs.After hearing the submissions, the bench, which had passed an interim order on June 4 allowing filling up of the middle seats if May 31 DGCA guidelines were adhered to, said it was making final its interim order and the same would apply to all international and domestic flights including Vande Bharat flights that were pressed into service to evacuate stranded Indians abroad. The court, however, kept the petition pending to decide on the question of whether a cost was to be imposed on the petitioner pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/airlines-can-fill-up-middle-seats-but-must-follow-sop-says-bombay-hc/story-lNxmsh16tGxmPCYbEhfdgJ.html
16-06-2020||India||Cap treatment cost at private hospitals: Centre to states||Union health ministry on Monday directed the states to fix a price for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) treatment in private hospitals after consultation with the sector as there have been reports of overcharging by private hospitals offering Covid-19 care.“…have consultations with the local private healthcare providers and arrive at reasonable rates, while factoring in cost elements for personal safety equipments for healthcare providers. It has been suggested that the rates, once fixed, must be widely publicized so that both the patients and service providers are fully aware and capacities are used optimally,” said health ministry in a statement.The health minister pointed out that certain states have already taken initiative, and reached an agreement with the private sector on reasonable rates and arrangements to provide critical care for in-patients.“PMJAY package and Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) package rates are already available with the States. The latter rates are fixed area wise.”As there have also been reports of shortage of critical beds in certain states, the centre has also asked states to engage with the private sector for scaling up health care infrastructure to meet the shortage of hospitals with intensive care unit beds, ventilators, oxygen supported beds etc, for treatment Covid-19.“States have also been asked to proactively engage with the private sector health providers and consider pooling in public and private healthcare facilities, as this will help in providing prompt, good quality and reasonable health care to Covid-19 patients.”As the Covid cases rise there has been an increased demand for critical care beds.As of now India has 958 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, with 1,67,883 isolation beds, 21,614 intensive care unit beds and 73,469 oxygen supported beds. There are 2,313 dedicated Covid health centres with 1,33,037 Isolation beds; 10,748 ICU beds and 46,635 oxygen supported beds have also been operationalised.In 7,525 Covid care centres there are 7,10,642 beds now available in the country. There are currently 21,494 ventilators available for covid beds.“Private sector does not mind pitching in but what the government must keep in mind is that there is a fixed cost involved in testing and treating Covid-19 patients, and it is not possible to go below a certain price bracket. The plan should be designed in such as way that those who can pay should be allowed to pay and those who cannot must be provided services free of cost or at subsidized rates,” said a senior private lab owner in Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cap-treatment-cost-at-pvt-hospitals-centre-to-states/story-ptoiQFLwMkw4anZ32oNuYP.html
16-06-2020||India||Cap Covid-19 treatment cost at private hospitals: Centre to states||Union health ministry on Monday directed the states to fix a price for coronavirus disease (covid-19) treatment in private hospitals after consultation with the sector as there have been reports of overcharging by private hospitals offering Covid-19 care.“…have consultations with the local private healthcare providers and arrive at reasonable rates, while factoring in cost elements for personal safety equipments for healthcare providers. It has been suggested that the rates, once fixed, must be widely publicized so that both the patients and service providers are fully aware and capacities are used optimally,” said health ministry in a statement.The health minister pointed out that certain states have already taken initiative, and reached an agreement with the private sector on reasonable rates and arrangements to provide critical care for in-patients.“PMJAY package and Central Government Health Scheme (CGHS) package rates are already available with the States. The latter rates are fixed area wise.”As there have also been reports of shortage of critical beds in certain states, the centre has also asked states to engage with the private sector for scaling up health care infrastructure to meet the shortage of hospitals with intensive care unit beds, ventilators, oxygen supported beds etc, for treatment Covid-19.“States have also been asked to proactively engage with the private sector health providers and consider pooling in public and private healthcare facilities, as this will help in providing prompt, good quality and reasonable health care to Covid-19 patients.”As the Covid cases rise there has been an increased demand for critical care beds.As of now India has 958 dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, with 1,67,883 isolation beds, 21,614 intensive care unit beds and 73,469 oxygen supported beds. There are 2,313 dedicated Covid health centres with 1,33,037 Isolation beds; 10,748 ICU beds and 46,635 oxygen supported beds have also been operationalised.In 7,525 Covid care centres there are 7,10,642 beds now available in the country. There are currently 21,494 ventilators available for covid beds.“Private sector does not mind pitching in but what the government must keep in mind is that there is a fixed cost involved in testing and treating Covid-19 patients, and it is not possible to go below a certain price bracket.

16-06-2020||India||25% Covid-19 patients at Lok Nayak from outside Delhi, medical director tells Amit Shah||Around 25% of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients being treated at the Delhi government-run Lok Nayak hospital are from neighbouring states, according to data presented by the hospital’s medical director during a visit by Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday.In a live telecast of the meeting, the director said that the hospital has so far treated 2,200 Covid-19 patients since it started admitting those with the viral infection in March. On Monday, the hospital had 580 positive cases and 188 suspected cases admitted to its isolation wards. The Lok Nayak hospital is the largest Covid-19 treatment centre in Delhi, with 2,000 beds.“Around 25% of our admissions in the last three months have been people from neighbouring states. When it comes to the deaths, there have been 455 deaths from Delhi and 14 from outside Delhi,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director Lok Nayak hospital. The Delhi government earlier decided to reserve the services in Delhi government hospitals and private hospitals that did not handle superspeciality cases for Delhi residents. Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, however, overturned the order on June 8. The Union home minister directed the Delhi chief secretary to install CCTV cameras in Covid-19 wards of every designated hospital in the national capital for proper monitoring, and set up alternative canteens for uninterrupted supply of food to the patients.In an order issued later in the evening, Vikram Dev Dutt, principal secretary, health and family welfare of the Delhi government, asked the Public Works Department (PWD) to get the CCTV cameras installed within 24 hours. “It is hereby directed that Covid wards in all Covid hospitals of the Delhi government shall have CCTV cameras for efficient monitoring and supervision of patient care. PWD, of Delhi government, is directed to install CCTV cameras in all Covid wards within 24 hours and submit a compliance report in this regard at pshealth@nic.in,” read the order. After the visit to the Delhi hospital, Shah also suggested psychosocial counselling of doctors and nurses engaged in fight against Covid-19.The home minister met senior doctors in the conference room of the hospital who briefed him about the number of patients treated at the facility, deaths there and the admissions process.The hospital also boasts of the largest dialysis centre in north India, having provided 1,140 dialysis sessions during the Covid-19 pandemic. There have been 122 deliveries in Covid-19-positive mothers at the hospital – 56 C-sections and 66 normal deliveries. This is the highest number of deliveries in Covid-19 patients by a hospital in the city so far, according to Dr Kumar.After the meeting with the medical director and other senior staff of the hospital, the minister also thanked all the nurses at the facility. He visited the hospital’s emergency department, which is being used to triage Covid-19 patients.With regard to the union home minister’s surprise visit at Lok Nayak hospital, a Delhi government spokesperson said: “The union minister interacted with doctors and medical staff and motivated them. He scrutinised the infrastructure and medical facilities in the hospital. For the last 10 days, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has been taking stock of all arrangements at Lok Nayak hospital. He has been monitoring all the grievances and issues and ensuring that they are resolved immediately. Today’s successful visit of the union minister was an endorsement of the better facilities at Lok Nayak hospital.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/25-covid-19-patients-at-lok-nayak-from-outside-delhi-medical-director-tells-amit-shah/story-Dl9GTFNBtwdTDfQI0wntSP.html
16-06-2020||India||Nearly 6 million migrants ferried in Shramik Specials : Rly board chairman||The average fare on Shramik Special trains meant for migrant workers and their families was Rs 600, railway board chairman VK Yadav said Monday adding that the national carrier ferried nearly 6 million migrants indicating it has generated a revenue of around Rs 360 crore from this.Indian Railways has run 4450 of these special trains for migrant workers. The Indian railways recovered only 15% of the total cost of operating the Shramik trains, Yadav said at a virtual press conference. “The fare was charged as per the normal sleeper fare of a mail express train,” he said.A spokesperson for the railway ministry clarified that the national carrier spent around Rs 3,400 per person on operating the trains.“Only a few migrants are left now as most have reached their home. We will continue to coordinate with state governments to send the remaining migrants back. We asked state governments to send us their demand of remaining trains on June 3 and we received a demand for 171 Shramik Special trains from various states…We ended up running 222 Shramik Special trains till June 14. After the Supreme Court’s order we have again sought details from the state governments to meet the additional demand,” Yadav said.As of now, a total 63 more Shramik Special Trains have been demanded by various states. Kerala, Andhara Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Gujarat and Jammu & Kashmir have sought the trains to ferry remaining migrants, according to the railway ministry.Speaking on the deployment of so-called Covid coaches , Yadav said the Covid isolation coaches are meant to be used when the health infrastructure of a state gets exhausted due to the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases. Suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients will be kept in separate Covid Coaches wherever they are allocated as per the guidelines issued by the health ministry, he addedThe Railways, has so far received a demand for coaches from Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and the Delhi government. The rest of the deployment will be done as and when states demand them, he added.The isolation coaches will be under the complete care of the chief medical officer of the respective state government. The Railway Board chairman said it is more suitable to use non-AC coaches for isolation purposes of suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients. For cooling, wherever required the Railways will provide roof insulation in the coaches, he added.For the national capital Delhi, at least 50 coaches with around 800 beds have already been stationed at Shakur Basti railway station. “We have earmarked 500 coaches for Delhi and we are jointly working with the Delhi government to finalise locations. A joint team is working on it. The main objective is that the Indian goverment and the state government should work as a team and see that we succeed in fighting the pandemic,”said Yadav.Around 180 coaches are scheduled to be placed at Anand Vihar railway station and some other stations on Tuesday and five pairs of trains running to and from the station will be diverted to Old Delhi railway station, the Northern railways spokesperson said.So far, no isolation coaches are in use in Delhi, officials said.The demand for the special coaches has come nearly two months after they were prepared. A total of 5,231 coaches were modified to be used as Covid Care Centres.In May, the government drafted a plan to deploy 5,231 railway coaches as isolation wards across 215 stations in 15 states considering the possibility of an increase in cases of Covid-19.The railway board wrote to the various railway zones in May seeking to take back 60% of the Covid-19 coaches to be utilised as Shramik trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-6-million-migrants-ferried-in-shramik-spls-rly-board-chairman/story-rKmwNquYDTGsFtwCFRDhPI.html
16-06-2020||India||China, Pakistan have more nuclear weapons than India: Study||China and Pakistan possess more nuclear weapons than India, according to a new yearbook released by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) on Monday.The think tank’s Yearbook 2020 pegs the number of nuclear warheads in the Chinese arsenal at 320, while the nuclear forces of Pakistan and India are estimated to have 160 and 150 weapons, respectively. The figures have been updated till January 2020.“One must keep in mind that nuclear weapons are not war-fighting weapons but only constitute a deterrence factor. Our no first use (NFU) policy suitably caters to the threat. While India keeps a sharp eye on this, it is imperative that our conventional capability accretion continues unhindered,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.India and its neighbours were ranked in the same order by SIPRI last year too when China possessed 290 nuclear warheads, Pakistan 150-160 and India, 130-140 warheads at the start of 2019.The findings come at a time when India and China are caught in a border confrontation along the contested line of actual control in eastern Ladakh. Also, there is a noticeable military buildup on both sides of the border --- stretching from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.China is carrying out “significant modernisation” of its nuclear arsenal and developing a “so-called nuclear triad for the first time” made up of new land and sea-based missiles and nuclear-capable fighter jets, SIPRI said in a statement announcing the launch of the yearbook.“India and Pakistan are slowly increasing the size and diversity of their nuclear forces,” it said.The yearbook, which “assesses the current state of armaments, disarmament and international security”, found while there has been an overall decrease in the number of nuclear warheads in 2019, all nuclear weapon-possessing countries continue to modernise their nuclear arsenals.With 6,375 and 5,800 warheads, Russia and the United States together possess more than 90% of global nuclear weapons.The nine nuclear-armed countries --- the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea --- together account for an estimated 13,400 nuclear weapons as of January 2020.“This marked a decrease from the 13,865 nuclear weapons that SIPRI estimated these states possessed at the beginning of 2019. Around 3,720 of the nuclear weapons are currently deployed with operational forces and nearly 1,800 of these are kept in a state of high operational alert,” the SIPRI statement said.It also highlighted low levels of transparency in reporting on nuclear weapon capabilities.“China now publicly displays its nuclear forces more frequently than in the past but releases little information about force numbers or future development plans,” the statement said.“The governments of India and Pakistan make statements about some of their missile tests but provide no information about the status or size of their arsenals,” it added.India was the third-biggest military spender in the world last year after the US and China, according to a SIPRI report released in April. It was the first time that two Asian countries featured among the top three military spenders.New Delhi’s defence spending grew by 6.8% to reach $71.1 billion in 2019, said the report on Trends in World in World Military Expenditure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-pak-have-more-nukes-than-india-study/story-oVIxnfrTIRIfMiKiabykkL.html
16-06-2020||India||Pakistan detains Indian mission officials||Pakistani authorities on Monday detained two junior staff members of the Indian mission in Islamabad and held them for almost 12 hours, releasing them after the Pakistani charge d’affaires in New Delhi was summoned to the foreign ministry for lodging a strong protest.The two non-diplomatic staff members, who were in an official car, were initially reported missing at 8 am Pakistan time while out on official duty, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. They were handed over to two other officials of the high commission at the Secretariat police station, located a short distance from the diplomatic enclave, about 12 hours later.The people said the two staff members had signs of injuries and would undergo a medical examination. The incident was widely seen in New Delhi as retaliation for the Indian government’s decision to expel two officials of the Pakistan high commission who were apprehended on charges of spying on May 31.Almost seven hours after the two staff members were reported missing, reports in the Pakistani media claimed they had been arrested after their car allegedly hit a pedestrian near the diplomatic enclave. The Express Tribune newspaper’s website reported the two men allegedly tried to flee and the car was stopped by a large group of bystanders who handed them over to police.A first information report (FIR) by Islamabad Police, accessed by HT, said the two men were charged under provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure related to rash driving, injuring a person through rash driving and possession of fake currency. The FIR further claimed fake Pakistani currency with a face value of Rs 10,000 was found in the car.These allegations were dismissed by the people cited above, who described them as false and baseless.Following the media reports, Pakistan’s charge d’affaires Syed Haider Shah was summoned to the external affairs ministry and served a demarche or formal diplomatic representation on the arrest of the two staff members. Shah was told there should be “no interrogation or harassment” of the Indians and that the responsibility for the safety and security of the personnel “lay squarely with the Pakistani authorities”, one of the people cited above said.“The Pakistan side was asked to return the two officials along with the official car to the high commission immediately,” the person added.There was no word from Pakistan’s Foreign Office regarding the incident.On May 31, India expelled two officials of the Pakistan high commission in New Delhi after they were detained by security agencies while trying to obtain classified materials on Indian security installations. Both men were declared “persona non grata for indulging in activities incompatible with their status as members of a diplomatic mission” and asked to India within 24 hours.Pakistan had condemned the Indian government’s action and said the officials were detained on “false and unsubstantiated charges”.Subsequently, India had also complained about the harassment of its diplomats in Islamabad. These developments have come at a time when ties between India and Pakistan are at an all-time low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-detains-indian-mission-officials/story-NRVQgqqPD7aKCx3hfU92rN.html
16-06-2020||India||Rahul hits out at Centre over hikes in fuel prices for ninth day in a row||A day after his party demanded that the benefit of reduced international crude oil prices should be passed on to consumers and the rates of petrol, diesel and LPG be reduced to August 2004 levels, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Monday attacked the government over the recent price hikes.“Middle class and the poor pay for the gifts crony capitalists get,” Gandhi tweeted.Gandhi also used a graph to show that prices of petrol and diesel were low in May 2014 under the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government despite high crude costs globally.The graph also showed that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government raised the excise duty on petrol 258.47% and on diesel 819.94% by June 15 this year.It said that on May 16, 2014, when the UPA was in power, the international crude oil price was $107.09 a barrel, while it was $40.66 on June 15 this year. Despite crude oil costing $66.43 less per barrel, petrol and diesel prices were higher than what they were in 2014, the graph showed.Gandhi’s attack came on a day oil companies raised petrol and diesel prices by 48 paise a litre and diesel by 23 paise a litre. This was the ninth daily increase in rates in a row since oil companies on June 7 restarted revising prices in line with costs.Apart from demanding that petrol and diesel be brought under the ambit of the Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Congress also sought a roll-back of excise duty hikes to bring down fuel prices.Meanwhile, the Communist Party of India (Marxist) has called for a nationwide protest on Tuesday against the Centre over the hike in fuel prices when the country is confronting the Covid-19 crisis.In another tweet, Gandhi used a quote by physicist Albert Einstein to take a swipe at the government, saying the only thing more dangerous than ignorance is arrogance.Gandhi shared another graph that showed how the four phases of lockdown flattened the curve of economic growth, instead of Covid-19 deaths, which are rising in the country.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Gopal Agarwal said the government has been working for the benefit of the lower strata of the population, through various beneficial schemes like Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojna etc. and also supporting economic revival through economic package Aatma Nirbahr Bharat for more then 20 lakh crore. “Over the years or during the current pandemic Modi government has successively reduced direct and indirect taxes. If the global oil prices have fallen, the logical step is to generate revenue, both at the Centre and the State level for the benefit of the common men, that’s what we are doing. As for Crony capitalist from the UPA era are concerned, they are paying through their nose, rest assured every pie will be recovered.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-hits-out-at-centre-over-hikes-in-fuel-prices-for-ninth-day-in-a-row/story-1zggjmNyOfu2TeEeRpfa8O.html
16-06-2020||India||Cyber attack: At least nine rights activists targeted||At least nine human rights activists were targeted last year with attempting computer hacking, researchers at Canada-based Citizen Lab and Amnesty International said in a report on Monday, detailing an operation that used email-delivered links that would infect the target’s computer with commercially available spyware.Among the targets were lawyers representing the activists arrested over the Bhima Koregaon case and some of who were subject to attacks through the Pegasus spyware that was delivered through WhatsApp.“Between January and October 2019, each of the targets were sent spearphishing emails containing malicious links that, if opened, would have installed NetWire, a commercially available spyware,” they said in the blog post.The targets were identified as lawyers Nihalsingh B Rathod, Isha Khandelwal, Degree Prasad Chauhan, Kolkata-based microbiologists Partho Sarathi Ray and Delhi-based academic PK Vijayan.“This new investigation confirms that there is a pattern of targeted attacks against Human Rights Defenders in India, and more specifically against those advocating for the release of the Bhima Koregaon 11 (the arrested activists),” said Amnesty International’s Etienne Maynier, one of the researchers who worked on the investigation.“The Indian government has a responsibility of addressing this issue and protecting the privacy and free speech of human rights defenders. We are thus calling on the Indian authorities to conduct an independent and transparent investigation on this unlawful surveillance,” he added.Spearphishing is a sophisticated cyber attack compared that is tailored to gain the target’s trust by, say, impersonating a known contact. Screenshots shared by the researchers showed the suspect mail senders impersonated as activists the targets may have known and court officials purportedly sending summons. The mails were accompanied with a link to what appeared to be a PDF file.According to the technical details published by the researchers, opening the PDF files would launch code that would install NetWire on a target’s Windows computer and also open an actual PDF file to minimize chances of suspicion.In September, 2018, Citizen Lab disclosed an illegal surveillance operation with targets in 45 countries using Israel-based NSO Group’s Pegasus malware. The malware would be installed onto target’s phones using flaws in WhatsApp’s code, a software exploit that is now the subject of a lawsuit filed by the Facebook-owned company. In October, 2019, Citizen Lab reached out to a number of the victims, including some named above.In a legal filing in April, NSO suggested some of its clients were nation-states when it hit back at WhatsApp and Facebook, saying they were seen as “safe spaces for terrorists and other criminals” who – without NSO’s services – could operate “without fear of detection by law enforcement”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cyber-attack-at-least-nine-rights-activists-targeted/story-Z33DVof3JDmsIYFyMKW4oI.html
16-06-2020||India||Man plans death for insurance money||Five days after a 37-year-old trader’s body was found hanging from a tree with his hands tied behind his back in outer Delhi’s Baprola Vihar, police on Monday said he had planned his murder to ensure his family got insurance money.Three men, including one previously involved in a rape case, have been arrested while a minor boy has been apprehended for allegedly killing Gaurav Bansal, who ran a grocery store in east Delhi’s Karkardooma, deputy commissioner of police A Koan said.“Bansal had hired the minor boy for getting himself killed. The boy roped in his friend, Manoj Kumar Yadav, who in turn roped in Suraj and Sumit Kumar to execute the job. Bansal had paid money to the apprehended persons for getting himself murdered. They have revealed that Bansal had told them that his family will get the insurance money if they killed him,” said Koan. Koan said Bansal had met the boy on social media.Bansal’s family expressed shock over the police’s claim.“The police have not told us anything about this. It is difficult for us to believe that my brother-in-law got himself killed by a juvenile he had met on social media. Two days ago, the police had told us that they had caught four suspects but did not tell us about this planned murder story. We will contact the concerned police officers regarding this murder theory,” said Bansal’s brother-in-law, Amit Kohli.When asked how much money Bansal paid the alleged killers and how much insurance money his family might have got, Koan said, “We have certain information about it but we cannot disclose it now as the probe is still in progress.”On June 9, Bansal went missing from his grocery store. His family lodged a missing complaint at the Anand Vihar police station the same night after he did not return home and his cellphone was found switched off. On June 10, around 8.30 am, Bansal was found hanging near a lake in Baprola Vihar, police said.“We registered a murder case since Bansal’s hands were tied behind his back. During the probe, we caught the first suspect, Suraj, on specific information. Suraj confessed to killing Bansal and revealed that he along with Manoj and Sumit were roped in by a minor boy, who was in contact with Bansal,” said Koan.He said the accused including the juvenile have been apprehended. “The accused persons committed this act of murder by hanging Bansal near the drain. They revealed that they had received money for this act from Bansal,” he added.Police said that Sumit Kumar, 26, was previously arrested in a rape case and he earns his livelihood by stitching bags. Yadav, 21, is a vegetable vendor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-plans-death-for-insurance-money/story-ZL3AY9PRAB8ZXFCT5N1rQM.html
16-06-2020||India||Bicycle sales ride on safety and health concerns||One day earlier this month, Mukesh Sharma, a freelance graphic designer got into a bus headed for Connaught Place. It was the first time in two months he was getting into a bus. The bus wasn’t crowded, and everyone in it was wearing masks but Sharma was still uncomfortable. And afraid. What if one of the passengers was an asymptomatic carrier of the coronavirus disease. He got down at the next stop. “And that evening, I went out and bought a cycle,” said Sharma.He isn’t the only one.With Delhi’s gyms remaining closed and people avoiding public transport (even cabs) from fear of Covid-19, cycle sales are soaring in a city that used to swear by cars. Some of the buyers haven’t cycled since their school days but that hasn’t stopped them from wholeheartedly taking to what is perhaps the most social-distanced mode of transport -- and also one of the most efficient ways of exercising and getting around.A constant rush of customers has prompted Gaurav Wadhwa, who runs one of the city’s oldest cycle shops in South Delhi’s Yusuf Sarai Market, to open for business at 7 am. His sales have gone up three times. “Earlier, I used to sell 25 cycles a day and now I sell 75,” said Wadhwa. He added that many customers are also bringing in their old bicycles to be repaired.Mayak Malhotra, another prominent cycle dealer in Paschim Vihar, echoed Wadhwa. He added that people are buying not-so-cheap mid-range hybrid bikes, not just for fitness but also to commute.“My sales have gone up five times in the past couple of weeks. A lot of people are buying cycles because they want to avoid public transport. I sold a cycle to a person who wished to switch to a cycle to commute from his home in Paschim Vihar to office in Rohini [15 km away]. A lot of these young people would earlier take the Metro or cabs.”In some ways, the cycle is the vehicle of the lockdown. There are countless tales of stranded migrant workers cycling hundreds of kilometres back home in the absence of public transport. It’s everyone’s favourite way of getting fit. And for those who can’t afford a car or a motorcycle, it is a great way to get around a city that still doesn’t see as much traffic as it used to.Dhruv Karan Mehta, who recently formed a cycling group, said the pandemic has helped many like him rediscover the joys of cycling. “I had a cycle which remained unused for a decade, and during the [Covid-19] lockdown, I started using it to get around my neighbourhood to buy essentials. It was such a great experience cycling on empty roads and I shared my cycling stories on social media,” said Mehta, a Defence Colony resident. “Some of those who followed my posts expressed interest in buying cycles and forming a cycling group. About eight of us recently bought new cycles and I now use only my cycle for short commutes.”Anant Rishi, a businessman in Sarvodya Enclave, recently bought two cycles–one for himself and another for his wife . “Now even my wife and father have become avid bikers. My gym is closed but I cycle 60 km every alternate morning,” said Rishi.As many as 30.6% of Delhi households owned a bicycle, and about 11% of the working population cycled to work, according to the 2011 census.Many believe the sudden interest in cycling can help make Delhi a more bike-friendly city. “The government should use this growing enthusiasm for cycles during the pandemic to prioritise development of cycling infrastructure in the city, something it has been talking about for many years now,” said Rajendra Ravi, founder, Institute For Democracy And Sustainability, a non-government organisation, which advocates for the rights of cyclists.Earlier this month, the Centre sent an advisory to states and Union territories, asking them to come up with short, medium and long- term plans to promote cycling and walking, among other interventions, for safe urban transit systems post-Covid-19. The advisory said cities across the world were ramping up their cycling systems in response to the coronavirus crisis.Authorities in New York, for example, have added 64 km of new non-motorized transport (NMT) lanes. Bogota in Colombia added 76 km. Milan converted 35 km of streets into cycling lanes. In Auckland (New Zealand) on-street car parking was removed to build 17 km of temporary bike lanes.The short-term strategy outlined in the Centre’s advisory includes creating temporary pedestrian areas, footpaths, and cycle lanes through removable barricades, tape, cones, road markings/painting, and mobile signs on identified corridors/areas. It seeks to encourage closure of one or more lanes to promote walking and cycling at a specific time or on a specific day.Experts believe that such “tactical urbanism”, which uses short term, low-cost, and scalable interventions, is a good way to catalyse long-term change and integrate cycling into urban transport systems.Prof Avilash Roul, the principal scientist at Indo-German Center for Sustainability, Indian Institute of Technology Madras, said cycling can be an effective alternative to public transport in the post-Covid world. Citing Albert Einstein who once wrote “life is like riding a bicycle, to keep your balance, you must keep moving,” Roul said cities too will have to perform a balancing act for a long time to come.“Cities such as Delhi, Mumbai, and Chennai, with very high infection rates, must immediately create pop-up cycle lanes and work to develop a plan for creating cycling infrastructure. While many cities, including Delhi, set up PBS [Public Bike Sharing] systems, they failed to simultaneously create cycling infrastructure,” added Roul.“The city governments must use this growing passion for cycling, and work with local communities to redesign roads and give a fair share to cyclists. ”Safety is paramount, experts say.Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the Centre for Science and Environment, cited the Census 2011 data and said nearly 48% of the daily trips in Delhi are within 5km range. “Across the world, cities have created pop-up bike lanes using bollards or markings on roads. People will switch to cycling or walking if we provide safe infrastructure to them. Cycling is a good option for people who have to travel short distances. It will also take the load off the public transport systems [that] will run on half or one-third capacity due to social distancing norms.”Sharma is enjoying his cycling. “It takes me about 40 minutes to reach CP,” he said.“ While it is dangerous to cycle in Delhi, at least I feel safe from the coronavirus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bicycle-sales-ride-on-safety-and-health-concerns/story-dUiw166nuablAfpx2qNBsO.html
16-06-2020||India||Delhi to scale up Covid testing, collect at least 11k samples a day||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has asked Delhi to start rapid antigen detection test along with the usual RT-PCR tests, and the Delhi government on Monday directed the district magistrates (DMs) of each of the city’s 11 districts and chief district medical officers (CDMOs) to send at least 1,000 samples every day. Both are measures aimed at massively scaling up testing for coronavirus disease (Covid-19), doubling it in two days and tripling it in the next six days as was promised by Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday. Shah’s comments came after his meeting with Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday; hours after his comments, the Delhi government issued an order, asking all testing laboratories “to scale up lab testing immediately” and release results not later than 48 hours since collection of the samples.According to the Delhi government’s recent submission in the Delhi high court, the combined daily testing capacity of 40 labs, 17 public and 23 private, is 8,600 per day.However, ICMR chief Balram Bhargava’s communication dated June 14 to the government states that these labs have a capacity to test 18,000 samples per day, which indicates that the Capital’s labs are being underutilised. The government is targeting 18,000 tests a day by June 20,. This will further increase the Capital’s current testing rate of 14,390 tests per million.In containment zones and hospitals, the Delhi government will be devising a plan to start using the antigen tests. Rapid antigen detection tests are quicker (maximum 30 minutes compared to 2-5 hours for RT-PCR tests) but are non-confirmatory tests. This means that those who test positive through rapid antigen detection tests are considered “truly positive” for Covid and do not have to undertake an RT-PCR test. But, those who test negative must go for an RT-PCR test for re-confirmation.“The plan to start testing at every polling booth in containment zones will essentially be through these tests. The rapid antigen detection test is nothing but an elimination method. It will help us narrow down on a smaller size of people who actually need the RT-PCR test ” said an official from the state health department who asked not to be named.The government has also directed its hospitals and Covid Testing Centres to increase the number of samples collected and has created linkages for each district with four laboratories for processing the samples. A total of 27 testing labs, both government and private, have been linked with Delhi’s 11 districts. Sunday’s order made it clear that labs can test as many samples as they want provided the results are released within a maximum of 48 hours. It also asked “all labs (both in private and public sector) to work on their full potential and also further ramp up their testing capacity on priority to meet the increased demand of processing”.“We have a capacity to accept about 100 government samples, but we have been asked to take in about 300. How can we do that. We do not have the machines or the staff. I had to ask my staff to stay back to ensure that all the samples are process; but this can be done only for one or two days,” said the owner of one of the private labs in the city. The reports of all Covid-19 test samples have to be given within 48 hours as per the mandate of the Delhi High Court.Covid-19 testing in Delhi fell to 4,900 a day on average during the last one week owing to some of the laboratories being shut down for not following ICMR guidelines. The week before 5,590 samples were being tested each day, as per Delhi government data.“The central government is extending to us the facilities of the testing labs that are under its jurisdiction. Delhi has been the only state to conduct maximum tests across the country, and it will continue to do so in the future with the support of the central government,” said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain in a video address on Monday.This comes just a day after the government resumed sending its samples to be tested at the centre-run National Centre for Disease Control. The government had stopped sending samples to the laboratory as several of the test reports were pending.“Large number of samples were reported pending at NCDC labs. To allow optimum time to the labs to clear the backlog, it was decided that no samples will be sent to the said labs till the pending samples are processed and reported. With no Delhi government samples pending with the said labs, it has been decided to allow submission of samples by various districts, Delhi government, and municipal hospitals with immediate effect,” the Sunday order read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-to-scale-up-covid-testing-collect-at-least-11k-samples-a-day/story-flWoe8CuNa2PpcVLsPnd5H.html
16-06-2020||India||Tamil Nadu reimposes lockdown in Chennai, 3 other districts||Three days after the state government told the Madras High Court that there would be no lockdown and threatened criminal action against people spreading such rumours, Tamil Nadu on Monday announced a lockdown from June 19 to 30 in its worst affected districts, after an expert panel warned the government that the state has hit its peak, but may hit another if strict measures aren’t followed immediately.On Monday, a panel of 19 medical experts advising the Tamil Nadu government on the coronavirus pandemic met Chief Minister Edappadi K Palaniswami, senior ministers and bureaucrats at the secretariat for the fifth time since the lockdown began in March. Chief Scientist at the World Health Organisation (WHO) Soumya Swaminathan also joined the hour-long meeting over video conference. The panel, which comprises Chennai-based National Institute of Epidemiology deputy director Dr Prabhdeep Kaur and Dr V Ramasubramanian, and infectious diseases expert at Chennai’s Apollo Hospitals among others, told the government that the spread of the infection in Tamil Nadu is at its peak now and the number of cases will gradually come down.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, panel members said that they warned that Tamil Nadu could have a second wave, as it has been observed in China, where at least 43 new cases of local transmission of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) were recorded in Beijing last week, after a gap of at least two months if the spread of the infection was not arrested through strict measures.“In the past three weeks, there has been an increase in the positivity rate of the infection in these four districts and in the last two weeks, there is a slight increase in deaths too,” Kuganantham told Hindustan Times. “To avoid an alarming situation we had to go ahead with this strategy. We need the support of the community to fight an epidemic or a pandemic. Else we have to press regulations.” The panel has asked the government to increase testing and manpower and intensify containment and quarantine measures. Following the meeting, Palaniswami held a cabinet meeting later in the day and announced another lockdown for Chennai and the three adjoining districts of Chengalpattu, Tiruvallur and Kancheepuram. Till June 15, these four district accounted for 83.69% of the state’s total caseload. Chennai alone accounts for 71.49% of all cases in the state.Yet some experts believe that lockdown is not the only strategy that the government should follow. “A lockdown only slows down the epidemic,” said Dr Jacob John, retired professor and former director of the Indian Council of Medical Research’s Centre of Advanced Research in Virology. “When HIV/AIDS broke out we didn’t ban sex, we made sex safe. Similarly in this context social contact should be safe and protected and not totally prohibited. The government should make people participants by focusing on social and behavioral change. The virus spread is inevitable and the next wave will start in rural areas which will not be protected because Chennai is under lockdown.”In the new lockdown, flights and trains services will continue, but autos, taxis and rental cabs can only ply for essential services and medical emergencies in the four districts. Restaurants will now go back to serving takeaway food. Grocery shops and petrol pumps will be open only from 6am to 2pm. Taking a leaf out of Karnataka that in May had implemented total lockdown on Sundays, Tamil Nadu too will not have any relaxations on the two Sundays that fall within this 12-day lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-reimposes-lockdown-in-chennai-3-other-districts/story-UP4oJyy3gNRpFbPrzg8TDI.html
16-06-2020||India||Centre wants states to focus on keeping Covid-19 fatality rates low||The Narendra Modi government wants states that are seeing a large number of Covid-19 cases not to lose sight of the main objective in the rush of numbers -- keeping the death rate, or the case fatality rate low. Top government officials familiar with the thinking said that while aggressive testing, door-to-door surveys to track Covid cases, and efforts to strengthen infrastructure will continue, there will be a renewed focus on keeping the death rate low. A detailed action plan for this purpose has already been chalked out, they added, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi may even raise the issue in his meeting with chief ministers on Tuesday and Wednesday.Even as India’s average death rate has remained low at 2.9 -- the global average is 5.4% -- the concern, the officials said, is that over 80% of the total deaths in the country are from just five states: Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh. “We have also noted with concern that 65 districts of India have more than 5% fatality rate. And the largest chunk, 19, of those districts are in Madhya Pradesh, followed by 11 in Gujarat and 10 each in Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh,” said one of the officials who asked not to be identified. In Madhya Pradesh, Mandla, Sehore, Umaria and Chhindwara are among the districts; in UP, Lalitpur, Jhansi, Meerut and Agra; and in Maharashtra, Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Dhule, and Aurangabad.  Gujarat’s Porbandar, Anand, and Ahmedabad, Punjab’s Kapurthala, and Haryana’s Jind are also among districts with a CFR of at least 5%.The official added that the CFR issue was discussed at length at the meeting called by the PM on Saturday. The meeting was attended by home minister Amit Shah, health minister Harsh Vardhan, and key bureaucrats who are members of the empowered groups tackling the Covid crisis. The meeting also discussed the spike in cases and deaths in Delhi and laid the ground for the meeting with the CMs.“The broad idea is that states should be encouraged to not suppress numbers; they will be told that the prime focus should remain on reducing the death toll. India’s death toll is already less than half of that some advanced western countries,” said a second official who asked not to be named. The emphasis on lowering death rates is in keeping with the government’s new strategy of not so much flattening the curve (of infections), but living with the virus. According to the officials, the Centre wants to focus on “fatality mitigation” and “end-to-end case management” to reduce the CFR and is aware that the number of positive cases is rising sharply (and will continue to), largely because of the return of millions of migrant workers to their homes in the hinterland, and the resumption of economic activities.HT reported on June 10 that states that have received the majority of migrants are seeing a spike in cases. The Centre’s suggested fatality reduction efforts include: active surveillance of the e vulnerable population such as senior citizens or people with comorbidities; improved “speed to care” which involves faster ambulance services; and less triage time in the hospitals.“We are asking states to do an assessment of how many people called for ambulances, how many were rejected and what time it took for the patient to reach hospital in an ambulance,” said another official, “and also ensure that when a patient reaches the hospital he or she should not spend more than 45 minutes in triage.”Triage is essentially a decision taken by health care workers on the order or priority of treatment and is commonly used in India to indicate wait times.The Centre is also asking states to ensure preference in hospitalization for co-morbid or elderly patients, timely referrals on escalation of symptoms, improving clinical practices, and providing on-call specialist care. Under the end-to-end case management, the Centre is stressing on the importance of providing all solutions starting from surveillance to ambulance service to treatment, even referrals.They have also pointed out that it is critical to “smoothen transition points” which includes test confirmation to hospitalization to ambulance coordination and its uptime.Last week, Amit Singh, associate professor at the Centre for Infectious Disease Research, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru had said, “I think mortality per million population is a much better metric to judge how Covid-19 has affected us. The case fatality rate can change depending on the denominator of the number of people who are tested and turn out to be positive.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-wants-states-to-focus-on-keeping-fatality-rates-low/story-uWdQ5fM3ThjWehE5owxMTM.html
16-06-2020||India||Nepal must create a ‘positive atmosphere’ for talks: Officials||The onus is on the KP Sharma Oli government in Nepal to create a “positive and conducive atmosphere” for talks with India to resolve the border row over the Kalapani-Lipulekh region, people familiar with developments said on Monday.The Indian side has repeatedly conveyed its readiness to discuss the issue, with the latest offer for talks between foreign secretaries of the two sides being made around the time the Nepal government tabled a constitutional amendment in Parliament on May 31 to give legal backing to the country’s new map, they said on condition of anonymity.The Indian side didn’t receive any response to these overtures and it is now up to the Oli government to create the positive environment needed for talks, the people said.“As recently as when the [constitutional amendment] bill was being tabled in [Nepal’s] Parliament and before that, India offered a phone call and a video-conference between the foreign secretaries and visits of the foreign secretaries. However, the Nepalese side didn’t respond to the offer and went ahead with passing the bill,” one of the people cited above said.“The onus is now on them to create a positive and conducive atmosphere for talks,” the person added.The people said Nepal’s unilateral action of issuing a new map that includes Indian territory has created a difficult situation and “pre-judged the outcome of any talks”. It also wasn’t clear why Oli or his government hadn’t told the Nepalese people or Parliament about the Indian offers for talks, they said.Nepalese officials have said they made three offers for talks to India between last November and May but got no response.The border row erupted last month after India opened an 80-km road to Lipulekh on the border with the Tibet Autonomous Region to facilitate pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar.Nepal lodged a strong protest and the government issued a new map that showed Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory. A constitutional amendment to give legal backing to the map was passed by the lower house of Nepal’s Parliament last week and is set to be taken up by the upper house this week.The people said almost 98% of the 1,750-km land and riverine border between India and Nepal has been delineated and differences remain only in the Kalapani sector in Uttarakhand and Susta sector in Bihar. Nepal’s “shifting” claims are contrary to the Treaty of Sugauli signed in 1815 by Nepal and the British, a ruling by the British governor-general in 1817, and Nepal’s boundary treaty with China of 1961 and protocols signed by these two countries in 1963 and 1979, they added.“Their new map is not based on facts and evidence. The Nepalese government decided to form an expert team to find and collect evidence to establish its ownership in Kalapani up to Limpiyadhura and in Susta area after publishing the map and passing the bill in the lower house,” the person cited above said.Describing Nepal’s new map as a “tool for political gains”, the person added: “The Nepalese government’s unilateral act of updating the map and the hasty effort to amend the constitution in Parliament reflect the intention of Prime Minister Oli and his government to politicise the boundary issue.“These actions do not reflect any seriousness on their part to resolve the issue through dialogue, and these actions are myopic and self-serving to further a limited political agenda.”Despite the border row, India remains committed to cooperating with Nepal on key humanitarian and connectivity projects, including rail links, and on the Covid-19 crisis, the people said. So far, India has provided medicines and equipment worth more than Rs 4.5 crore to Nepal to fight the coronavirus pandemic, they said.The people also dismissed Oli’s repeated comments that Covid-19 was being spread in Nepal by people coming from India, describing them as “false and distorted”. Only a small portion of the 8 million Nepalese citizens living in India had returned home, they said. They noted that even as the constitutional amendment regarding the map was being discussed in Parliament, there were protests in Kathmandu over the Oli government’s handling of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-must-create-a-positive-atmosphere-for-talks-officials/story-R7l4pA0c4tv7jcv4lIUbRK.html
16-06-2020||India||Will solve misunderstandings through dialogue, says Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Monday there was no question of the breaking down of historical, social, and spiritual ties that bind New Delhi and Kathmandu, even as relations between India and Nepal have taken a hit after a new Nepalese map laid claim to territory that belongs to India. Singh rejected Nepal’s territorial claims and reiterated India’s stand that the Lipulekh-Dharchula road falls in India. He expressed willingness to sort out the “misunderstanding” through dialogue. “If there are some misconceptions over the road between Lipulekh and Dharchula, then we will sit together and solve those issues through dialogue. And I can say this with full confidence that no Indian has any hatred towards Nepal as the relation is so deep,” Singh said during a virtual rally focused on Uttarakhand. In May, the defence minister inaugurated the road in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district and prompted a strong reaction from Nepal. Kathmandu has maintained that the road passes through its territory. Nepal’s parliament on Saturday voted unanimously to amend its constitution to redraw the country’s political map, which lays claims over the strategically key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura. India termed the decision “untenable” and in violation of current understanding to hold talks on outstanding border issues. Singh referred to the war cry “Jai Maha Kali, Ayo Re Gorkhali [hail goddess Mahakali, the Gorkhas are here]” of the Indian Army’s Gorkha regiments, which also draw soldiers from Nepal, and said Maha Kali’s devotees are all over India, emphasising that the ties between India and Nepal can’t break.He referred to the valour and courage that Gorkha soldiers have displayed for the country. “India-Nepal ties are not ordinary. We have a relation... which cannot be broken by any power of the world,” said Singh, referring to strong people-to-people connect between the two countries. “We do not have just geographical, historical, or social relations with Nepal but also spiritual ones. Who can forget Baba Pashupatinath? How can he be separated from Baba Amarnath, Somnath, and Kashi Vishwanath?” he asked.One person was killed and two wounded on Friday when Nepal’s Armed Police Force fired upon a group of Indian villagers near Bihar’s Sitamarhi for allegedly entering Nepal in violation of the lockdown there.At the event, Singh also praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his leadership in the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. “PM Modi took the difficult challenge of fighting the pandemic and so far has taken many bold and crucial decisions to contain it. Those efforts have not only been lauded by the other countries but also by WHO [the World Health Organization],” he said. He said the government has strengthened the health infrastructure within a short time. “...we are now not only producing PPE [personal protection equipment] kits for our health workers but are exporting them. We are sure that together we will soon win this fight.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-will-solve-misunderstandings-through-dialogue/story-CCO49DdqeASjt7g6pceTXO.html
16-06-2020||India||Supreme Court raps dealers for flouting BS-IV sale rules||Last minute sales of BS-IV vehicles across the country till March 31, the deadline fixed by the Supreme Court for phasing out these vehicles have come under the judicial scanner. On Monday, the top court was riled to note that while its earlier order (dated March 27) permitted registration of 1.09 lakh BS-IV vehicles sold till March 31, the Federation of Automobile Dealers Association (FADA) produced a list of 2.25 lakh vehicles awaiting registration.Spotting this surge, the bench of Justices Arun Mishra and S Abdul Nazeer said: “There is clear cut violation of our order….Annexure A and B (filed by FADA) indicate that more than 2.25 lakh vehicles were awaiting registration as on March 31, 2020 whereas it exceeds the figure more than 1 lakh (1.05 lakh two­-wheelers, 2250 cars and 2000 commercial vehicles) that we specified in the order (of March 27).”Fixing the next hearing on June 19, the bench sought details of the vehicles sold up to March 31, the date of sale along with category of vehicle sold, and also the details of sales made after lifting of the lockdown on May 3. The Court in its March 27 order, as an exception, allowed automobile dealers to sell 10% of the BS-IV idle stock lying with them throughout the country except in Delhi-NCR.This order was passed keeping in mind the health of citizens; in a bid to curb air pollution the Court ordered phasing out of BS-IV vehicles and the rollout of BS-VI fuel-based engines from April 2020.The Court also directed the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways to provide details of BS-IV vehicles sold as on March 31, 2020 that were specified on the Government’s E-vahan portal. The Court ordered the Centre to collect information on the sale of BS-IV vehicles after the lockdown ended from all regional transport offices (RTOs) throughout the country. FADA submitted to the Court that the mismatch in sale figures came about as non-members of the association did not supply details of sales at the time when the Court passed the order on March 27. But the bench said that its order was binding on members and non-members alike. In fact, on March 27, the bench was informed that the unsold BS-IV inventory comprised of 7 lakh two-­wheelers, 15,000 passenger cars and 12,000 commercial vehicles.“It appears that the order (of March 27) is being misused for the reasons best known to the respondents (FADA) and they have not filed affidavit in compliance of the order passed by this Court,” said the bench, adding, “Registration of vehicles which were to be sold out of 10 per cent cannot be made without the permission of this Court and without giving particulars as ordered by this Court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-raps-dealers-for-flouting-bs-iv-sale-rules/story-BjZEmBDodUk9s7rRI59kwK.html
16-06-2020||India||Assam orders study as tremors continue||The Assam government on Monday asked a group of scientists to study tremors being felt at Baghjan in Tinsukia district, where a gas well caught fire on June 9, and submit a report for it to take appropriate steps to deal with them. The mild temblors have triggered panic in the region, where residents said some houses have also developed cracks.The Oil India Limited (OIL), which operates the well, has also asked CSIR-North East Institute of Science and Technology (CSIR-NESIT) to study the induced seismicity in the area because of the blowout, or uncontrolled release of gas when pressure systems fail, that began from the well in late May. Induced seismicity refers to tremors and earthquakes, mostly of low magnitude, which are caused by human activity including oil and gas operations.Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal promised the study during a visit to the site along with Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday. He met the scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati (IIT-G) and CSIR-NEIST and commissioned them the study. Residents of Baghjan and nearby Natun Rongagora village have reported repeated tremors since June 9 when the well caught fire a fortnight after gas and oil condensate began leaking from it following the blowout. “We started experiencing tremors from Wednesday [last], a day after the well caught fire. ...walls of several houses developed cracks,” said Hiren Senapati, a Natun Rongagora resident.“The tremors have been felt intermittently. Nearly 80% of our villagers are staying in relief camps, the rest who were in their homes are scared to live there because of the tremors...”Nearly 2,000 families, which were evacuated because of the blowout beyond a radius of 1.5 km from the well, were later shifted even further and housed in 12 relief camps because of the fire.Gauhati University’s geology professor Bhagawat Pran Duarah said since gas and condensate is flowing uncontrollably because of the blowout, such tremors can happen due to sudden release of pressure. “But usually they are not that severe and do not cause any large scale damage.”CSIR-NEIST director G Narahari Sastry some tremors may have been felt in the area close to the well. “From a scientific point of view, we are very keen to look at what are these tremors and analyse their impact,” he said. In a statement on Monday, OIL said five broadband seismographs, which are used to detect and record earthquakes, will be deployed by CSIR-NESIT at five sites for data to be recorded for 7-10 days. “Locations have been identified and preliminary civil work for deployment of the instruments is in progress.” The fire continued to rage at the well amid fears of damage to the eco-sensitive area. OIL last week said it could take about four weeks to control the fire. The state government on Thursday ordered a probe into the inferno as protests by angry residents over alleged inaction hit crude oil production in the state.The fire left two firefighters dead while authorities were trying to control the blowout. The well is located a kilometre from the Dibru Saikhowa National Park. The eco-sensitive Maguri Motapung wetland is just a few hundred metres away from the inferno site. The blowout has polluted the Lohit river and adjoining wetland and toxic pollutants may have killed fish, insects, as well as pose risk to endangered Gangetic dolphins in the region, a preliminary Wildlife Institute of India survey report said last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-orders-study-as-tremors-continue/story-3oe4Qf69mtLDfndV5brr3N.html
16-06-2020||India||Travel for faith: NCR residents cross border to fulfil long pending meeting with almighty||Unlock 1.0 has allowed reopening of places of worship in Delhi. But, the same continue to remain closed in some parts of NCR. This, however, hasn’t been able to deter the determination of those who had been long away from their revered place of worship. As a result, quite a few residents of Gurugram and even Noida have been crossing the border to visit their religious place in Delhi. In fact, some residents of NCR had been eagerly looking forward to visit their favourite holy sites, during the lockdown. “I was wanting to visit the Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place for a long time. Just before the lockdown happened, I had vowed to visit this temple while praying for my grandmother’s recovery after her recent knee surgery. After months, when I finally got a chance to fulfil my promise, how could crossing the border stop me,” asks Nagarjuna Pratap Singh, a resident of Gurugram’s DLF Phase 2, adding, “The feeling of visiting a temple after months was surreal, and the journey across the two states was worth it!”Some Gurugram residents, who had been waiting eagerly to visit their place of worship during the holy month of Ramzan, have also travelled inter-state, braving the pandemic. “We couldn’t visit the mosque amid the lockdown; even on Eid we stayed indoors to follow the rules of social distancing. Therefore, we were hoping that mosques would open in Gurugram just like they have opened in Delhi. However, that didn’t happen. That’s when I decided to travel to Old Delhi’s Fatehpuri mosque. Even though the long travel was a peril, and constant anxiety about the pandemic stressed me, the happiness of finally getting to be in the mosque and pray released all my stress,” says Suhail Ahmed, who visited the mosque carrying a hand sanitiser and wore mask and gloves.For many residents, the lockdown was a period wherein they engaged virtually with the almighty. However, for some that didn’t work out to their satisfaction. “I was hoping and waiting that in the first phase of Unlock, at least our neighbourhood temples and gurdwaras will open. But that didn’t happen in my city,” says Geeta Sharma, a resident of Sector 21, Noida. She adds that she spent the lockdown singing bhajans while staying connected digitally with her friends. “But somehow that didn’t make up for the feeling of attending a real aarti. That’s why I have been insisting on going to Delhi to visit the Kalkaji Temple,” says Sharma adding, “I look forward to the temples opening up in my city so that I don’t have to travel so far.”Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/travel-for-faith-ncr-residents-cross-border-to-fulfil-long-pending-meeting-with-almighty/story-5FzP127awUwBYV0WpIfOMM.html

In nine hikes since June 7, cumulatively petrol prices have gone up by Rs 5 per litre and diesel by Rs 4.87 a litre, according to PTI. In Delhi, petrol will now cost Rs 76.26 per litre and diesel Rs 74.26 a litre after the hike.Rates have been increased across the country and vary from state to state depending on the incidence of local sales tax or VAT.In the tweet, Rahul Gandhi also used a graph to show that fuel prices were low in May 2014 when the Congress-led UPA was in power despite high crude cost globally, but the NDA government raised the excise duty on petrol by 258.47 per cent and on diesel by 819.94 per cent as on June 15, 2020.Earlier on Sunday, the Congress leader posted another tweet as he continued his attack on the Modi government, this time over the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis. He used the famous scientist Albert Einstein’s quote to criticise the nationwide lockdown due to Covid-19 pandemic.“This lock down proves that: “The only thing more dangerous than ignorance is arrogance.” Albert Einstein,” Gandhi said on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poor-pay-for-gifts-crony-capitalists-get-rahul-gandhi-slams-centre-on-fuel-price-hike/story-gZMZ3Nr3n8u5PeDqzekGrK.html
16-06-2020||India||Week after fire at Assam gas well, tremors continue; govt orders study||Assam government on Monday asked a group of scientists to conduct a study on the tremors being felt at Baghjan in Tinsukia district, where a natural gas well of Oil India Limited (OIL) caught fire on June 9, two weeks after it started releasing gas and oil condensate following a blow-out.Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal met scientists of Indian Institute of Technology-Guwahati (IIT-G) and CSIR-North East Institute of Science and Technology (CSIR-NEIST) and asked them to conduct the study on emergency basis and submit a report so that the government can take appropriate steps.During a visit to the site along with union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday, Sonowal had promised that a study would be done to probe the reasons for the tremors.Since June 9 when the well caught fire, residents of Baghjan and Natun Rongagora villages which are close to the site, have been complaining of repeated tremors. Some houses have also developed cracks due to the tremors.“We started experiencing tremors from Wednesday, a day after the well caught fire. That night the tremors lasted for nearly 10-12 hours and walls of several houses got cracked,” said Hiren Senapati, president of eco-development committee of Natun Rongagora.“The tremors have been happening intermittently now. Nearly 80% of our villagers are staying in relief camps, the rest who were in their homes are scared to live there because of the tremors, which could be around 5 on the Richter scale,” he added.Authorities at OIL have also asked CSIR-NESIT to carry out a study of the induced seismicity (tremors and quakes caused by human activity including oil and gas operations) in Baghjan and neighbouring areas because of the blow out.“Five broadband seismographs will be deployed by CSIR-NESIT at five sites for data to be recorded for 7-10 days. Locations have been identified and preliminary civil work for deployment of the instruments is in progress,” said a release issued by OIL on Monday.“It is possible that some tremors had happened in the area close to the well, which witnessed a blow out and subsequently caught fire. From a scientific point of view, we are very keen to look at what are these tremors and analyse its impact,” said G Narahari Sastry, director, NEIST. Meanwhile, work continued at the well site to control the fire and plug the blow out.

16-06-2020||India||National lockdown extended till May 3. Why April 20 is still a crucial date||In his address to the nation, Prime Minister Narendra Modi extended the national lockdown till May 3 but held out hope that the lockdown norms, to be enforced strictly for the next one week, could be relaxed for localities that do not have a single case from April 20.For the next one week, PM Modi said, the government will meticulously track the enforcement of lockdown and spread of the disease right down to the police station level. He asked people to step up too, describing the next one week as an agni pariksha, or trial by fire.“Localities that pass this agni pariksha and do not allow the disease to spread, can get permission for some essential activities,” PM Modi said in his televised address that announced extension of the national lockdown. This was his third in a month.“But remember that this permission will be conditional. If lockdown rules are violated and coronavirus spreads, all permissions will be cancelled. So you should not be negligent nor let others be negligent, PM Modi said.The prime minister said this relaxation was being proposed to enable the poor to earn their daily livelihood.Watch: PM Modi extends lockdown till 3 May; promises calibrated withdrawal from 20 April The last time he addressed the nation was on 24 March when he announced the national lockdown to stop the coronavirus disease from spreading. By then, India had reported 536 cases and 10 deaths; Delhi had reported 30.As PM Modi stood in front of the country again on Monday, he wore a home-made mask that he removed moments before speaking.Coronavirus has, despite the lockdown spread rapidly, infecting over 10,000 people and killing 339. Delhi has reported over 1,500 cases.An analysis by the health ministry says the lockdown has already saved thousands of people from being infected. PM Modi also spoke about the crucial role the lockdown had played to slow down the spread of the disease. But he acknowledged it had come at a price.“I know that many of you faced problems.
