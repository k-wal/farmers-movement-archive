School education minister Varsha Gaikwad was among those who attended it. The move comes days after the Centre announced a three-phase plan to lift stringent restrictions imposed over two months ago to stop the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Centre has said in the second phase, it plans to reopen all educational institutes including schools and colleges after holding discussions with states and Union Territories.“Though in some areas, schools cannot be opened, the process of teaching cannot be stopped. The use of digital technology to reach out to students should be adopted,” a government circular said.Gaikwad said the government has stipulated certain hours of online teaching per week for students from Class 2 onwards and that there were demands for reopening all schools from August.In Tripura, the state government has formed a committee to examine the timings and modalities of re-opening educational institutions. “In the 32-member committee, we have members from different fields, including the education department officials. Six parents will be on the committee as invited members. We will examine the timing for re-opening of all the educational institutions,” education minister Ratan Lal Nath said.The Uttarakhand government has directed students to submit health certificates saying they have suffered from influenza-like illnesses over 14-days before taking board examination. The students will have to reach examination halls an hour early to ensure social distancing norms and carry personal sanitisers. The Uttarakhand government released the date sheet for the remaining board exams from June 22-25. R K Kunwar, the state’s school education department director, said the number of examination rooms has been doubled to ensure social distancing. “Students with a fever will be able to write their papers in separate rooms.”In Rajasthan, the state education board has asked school authorities to have sanitisers in every examination room and have students reach there at least an hour before the start of the exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-plan-reopening-of-schools-colleges/story-szkUhbO6nUnbntBwlVfPRI.html
15-06-2020||India||Telangana caps price of testing, treatment||HyderabadA day after announcing that private labs will be allowed to test for Covid-19 and corporate hospitals, permitted to treat Covid-19 patients, the Telangana government on Monday fixed a cap on the cost of diagnostic tests and treatment.Telangana has joined the list of states that have instituted pricecaps on treatment for the coronavirus disease in private hospitals. State health minister Eatala Rajender told reporters that the private labs authorised by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the state will not charge more than Rs 2,200 for the tests, although he recommended that they avoid testing asymptomatic individuals. Similarly, the charges in private hospitals cannot exceed Rs 4,000 a day in normal wards, Rs 7,500 in Intensive Care Units (ICU) without ventilator and Rs 9,000 with ventilator support, he added.However, private hospitals would be permitted to collect additional charges for anti-viral drugs when the patients are on ventilator. Some anti-viral injections could cost up to Rs 50,000, the minister explained.Rajendar said tests will be done as per ICMR guidelines. And everyone who tests positive need not be hospitalised ; those with mild infections can stay in home quarantine, he added. On Sunday, chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao said that in the following 10 days, the health department would conduct tests on 50,000 people in 30 assembly constituencies in and around the capital city.As of Sunday, Telangana had 4974 cases of which 2312 are active; thus far, 185 people in the state have lost their lives to the viral disease. The minister said the health department is establishing a link between private health care establishments and the government for sharing of information related to number of tests, positive and negative cases and number of persons who are admitted at private hospitals.“The private hospitals will have to upload the information about the tests and treatment on the health department portal,” he said.Rajendar said the government would not take up rapid testing but continue with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Mass testing will be done in several parts of Hyderabad and other containment zones in the state which reported high number of cases.Laboratories in the state have the capacity to conduct 4,000 tests a day; thus far, ICMR has approved nine public and 17 private labs in the state to conduct tests. The department will do surveillance on each household in Hyderabad, to prevent the spread of the deadly disease, Rajendar said, adding that there are no plans to reimpose lockdown restrictions in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-caps-price-of-testing-treatment/story-2alEn6IVWFhqSfceorxvTN.html

Kandhamal district, which had reported 89 coronavirus cases till Sunday, added 48 new cases taking the total to 136. The steep rise came even as the state imposed a weekend shutdown in 11 of its districts that account for around 80 per cent of the total cases. It even imposed stricter lockdown norms in the Covid-19 epicentre of Ganjam district, where all business activity or vehicular movement was stopped after 12 o’clock during the day.Health department officials said with June and July likely to be crucial for tackling the coronavirus pandemic, accredited social health activists and auxiliary nursing midwife workers in Odisha will conduct a door-to-door survey from June 16.“The ASHA and ANM workers will visit each and every house in villages and slums in urban areas to identify people with Covid-19 symptoms. This campaign will continue till July 31,” said National Health Mission director Shalini Pandit.She said that only symptomatic people and close contacts of positive cases will be tested in accordance with ICMR guidelines. “Earlier when asymptomatic people were being tested, one among 200 of them was found to be infected. Now, one in every 20 symptomatic cases is testing positive for the virus,” she said.Pandit, however, said despite rising Covid-19 cases, positivity rate per lakh population in Odisha is 9.3 per cent compared to 88 per cent in Maharashtra and 205 per cent in Delhi. Odisha has also posted 2,708 recoveries, around 67 per cent of the total cases that is comparable to states like Rajasthan and union territories like Andaman and Nicobar islands.“We have so far conducted 2 lakh tests. Tests per million in the state is higher than the India average. The death rate of 0.3 per cent in Odisha has also remained low compared to 6.6. per cent in Delhi and India’s average of 0.7 per cent,” she said.“There has been a rise in positive cases across India after easing of lockdown restrictions. Doctors say cases will continue to rise in the next four to six weeks. Now, the onus is on the people to abide by the Covid-19 guidelines to keep the virus at bay,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-to-start-door-to-door-survey-for-covid-19-symptoms-as-cases-cross-4000-mark/story-1PcdOKVhdIrNTZvi6YaCHI.html

Nayak allegedly helped the businesses of Seashore by building a relationship with top IAS and IPS officers, journalists and senior politicians of the ruling BJD.Nayak was questioned for ‘certain clarifications’, CBI sources said.Seashore is one of the 44 companies being probed by the CBI since May 2014 following a Supreme Court order. The company reportedly raised around Rs 578 crore from gullible people offering 36 per cent interest per annum to the investors on their deposits.Nayak was first arrested in 2014 soon after CBI took over the case and the diaries seized from his house allegedly revealed that he had paid off several politicians, IAS and IPS officers on behalf of Seashore. Following the seizure, CBI had interrogated four IPS officers of Odisha between 2014 and 2016. Nayak later got bail from the Orissa High Court in August 2017.Seashore Group chief Prashant Dash who was also arrested, is now out on bail.Though opposition BJP and Congress had made an issue of the chit fund scam in 2014 polls, it went off the radar in the 2019 elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-two-year-gap-cbi-turns-focus-back-on-odisha-chit-fund-scam/story-lJhBvo443EkaBjpFDABhWI.html

The railway ministry has sought additional demand from states for ferrying remaining migrants back.“Only a few migrants are left now as most have reached home. We will continue to coordinate with state governments to send the remaining migrants back. We had asked state governments to send us their demand of remaining trains on June 3 and we received a demand for 171 Shramik Special trains from various states…We ended up running 222 Shramik Special trains till June 14. After the Supreme Court’s order we have again sought their need from the state governments to meet the additional demand,” Yadav said.As of now, a total of 63 more Shramik Special Trains have been demanded by various states following the Chairman of Railway Board’s letter to the states. A total of seven states; Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Gujarat and Jammu & Kashmir have sought the trains to ferry remaining migrants, according to the railway ministry.Speaking on deployment of Covid Coaches amid rising cases and demand by some state governments, Yadav said the Covid isolation coaches are meant to be used when the health infrastructure of various states gets exhausted due to the sudden spike in Covid-19 cases across the country.Suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients will be kept in separate Covid Coaches wherever they are allocated as per the guidelines issued by the health ministry, he said. The Railways, has so far received a demand for coaches from Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and the Delhi government. The rest of the deployment will be done as and when states demand them, he added. The isolation coaches will be under the complete care of the chief medical officer of the state government, in the states where they will be deployed.The Railway Board chairman said it is more suitable to use non-AC coaches for isolation purposes of suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients. For cooling, wherever required the Railways will provide roof insulation in the coaches, he added.For national capital Delhi, at least 50 coaches with around 800 beds have already been stationed at Shakur Basti railway station. “We have earmarked 500 coaches for Delhi and we are jointly working with the Delhi government to finalise locations. A joint team is working on it. The main objective is that Indian government and state government should work as a team and see that we succeed in fighting the pandemic,” Yadav said.Around 180 coaches are scheduled to be placed at the Anand Vihar railway station and some other stations on Tuesday and five pairs of trains running to and from the station will be diverted to the Old Delhi railway station, a Northern Railways spokesperson said.So far, no isolation coaches or beds are in use in Delhi, officials said.The demand for the special coaches has come nearly two months after they were prepared. Trains with a composition of 10 coaches and patient capacity of 16 people have been made ready by the railways. A total of 5,231 coaches were modified to be used as ‘Covid Care Centres.’The first such Covid Care Centre was deployed at Shakur Basti railway station in New Delhi on May 31 consisting of 10 non-AC coaches with 160 beds and three AC coaches, for healthcare staffers, including doctors.The Centre in May had drafted a plan to deploy 5,231 railway coaches as isolation wards across 215 stations in 15 states considering the possibility of an increase in cases of Covid-19.The railway board had written to zones in May seeking to take back 60% of the Covid-19 coaches to be utilised as Shramik Special trains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/60-lakh-migrants-ferried-at-cost-of-rs-600-per-person-on-shramik-specials-railways/story-1bqVGFz5MUgnel5mpvCA9L.html

Earlier, it was limited to just Maharashtra.People from the two states, Delhi and Tamil Nadu, will have to undergo institutional quarantine for a period of three days followed by 11 days of home quarantine, while those from Maharashtra will have to undergo compulsory one week institutional quarantine followed by one week of home quarantine. For people coming from states other than these three, it is two weeks of home quarantine.This and several other decisions were taken at a review meeting chaired by chief minister BS Yediyurappa, following concerns over increase in Covid-19 cases in the state.Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Karnataka CM pointed out that of the 7,000 Covid-19 positive cases registered in the state till Sunday evening 4,386 were returnees from Maharashtra and an additional 1,340 were those in contact with them. Those who had come from overseas, only 216 were tested Covid-19 positive.“Transmission is not happening because of movement within the state but because of people returning from other states and therefore we have to take these measures to contain it,” he added.Yediyurappa also claimed that the state was doing significantly better than the national average. He said while the state’s mortality rate was 1.2 per cent, the national average was 2.8 per cent. He also said that Karnataka had a recovery rate of 56.6 per cent against the national average of 51 per cent.Responding to a question on reimposition of the lockdown, the CM said if anything he would appeal to the PM for further relaxations.

An official bulletin from the state legislature said the session would commence at 9.55 am with the joint address of the state legislative assembly and legislative council by Governor Biswabhushan Harichandan through video conferencing from Darbar Hall of Raj Bhavan, keeping in view the Covid-19 pandemic in the state.As per the schedule, the session will be held only for two days, but a final call will be taken by the Business Advisory Committee (BAC) of the state legislature which will meet soon after the Governor’s address.Later in the afternoon, finance minister Buggana Rajendranath Reddy will present the state budget in the Assembly. On June 17, there will be a short debate on the thanksgiving motion for the Governor’s address, followed by passage of appropriation bill.On June 18, the appropriation bill would be introduced in the legislative Council and on June 19, the election for four vacant Rajya Sabha seats will be held. “If the BAC decides to extend the session, it might continue till Saturday. Otherwise, both the Houses would be adjourned sine die immediately after the passage of appropriation bill,” an official in the state legislature familiar with the development said.The assembly authorities have made all the arrangements for the holding of the budget session. Seating arrangements have been changed to maintain physical distance in the assembly and council, the official said.While a select group of media persons would be allowed only into the press gallery, no permission would be given for news channels to install their cameras for live telecast of the session. ““No visitors would be allowed into the assembly premises,” the bulletin said.The budget session of the state assembly was originally scheduled to be held in the last week of March, but was cancelled following the sudden announcement of lockdown by the Centre to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Since the financial year 2020-21 was to commence from April 1, the state had no option but to go in for promulgation of ordinance on March 30 to draw funds from the state’s consolidated fund for three months.As the three-month period will expire by June 30, the state is compelled to hold the assembly session to pass the budget for the next nine months and also approve the expenditure incurred for the first three months of the financial year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/under-shadow-of-covid-19-andhra-to-hold-short-budget-session-from-tuesday/story-Dw1zaCCKeVduI3nL8EePsI.html
15-06-2020||India||Onus on Nepal govt to create ‘positive atmosphere’ for talks on border row||The onus is on the KP Sharma Oli government in Nepal to create a “positive and conducive atmosphere” for talks to resolve the border row over the Kalapani-Lipulekh region, people familiar with developments said on Monday.The Indian side has repeatedly conveyed its readiness to discuss the issue, with the latest offer for talks between foreign secretaries of the two sides being made around the time the Nepal government tabled a constitutional amendment in Parliament on May 31 to give legal backing to the country’s new map, the people said on condition of anonymity.The Indian side didn’t receive any response to these overtures and it is now up to the government of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to create the positive environment needed for talks, the people said.“As recently as when the [constitutional amendment] bill was being tabled in [Nepal’s] Parliament and before that, India offered a phone call and a video-conference between the foreign secretaries and visits of the foreign secretaries. However, the Nepalese side didn’t respond to the offer and went ahead with passing the bill,” one of the people cited above said.“The onus is now on them to create a positive and conducive atmosphere for talks,” the person added.The people said Nepal’s unilateral action of issuing a new map that includes Indian territory has created a difficult situation and “pre-judged the outcome of any talks”. It also wasn’t clear why Oli or his government hadn’t told the Nepalese people or Parliament about the Indian offers for talks, they said.Nepalese officials have said they made three offers for talks to India between last November and May but got no response.The border row erupted last month after India opened an 80-km road to Lipulekh on the border with the Tibet Autonomous Region to facilitate pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar.Nepal lodged a strong protest and the government issued a new map that showed Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory. A constitutional amendment to give legal backing to the map was passed by the lower house of Nepal’s Parlaiment last week and is set to be taken up by the upper house this week.The people said almost 98% of the 1,750-km land and riverine border between India and Nepal has been delineated and differences remain only in the Kalapani sector in Uttarakhand and Susta sector in Bihar. Nepal’s “shifting” claims are contrary to the Treaty of Sugauli signed in 1815 by Nepal and the British, a ruling by the British governor general in 1817, and Nepal’s boundary treaty with China of 1961 and protocols signed by these two countries in 1963 and 1979, they added.“Their new map is not based on facts and evidence. The Nepal governemnt decided to form an expert team to find and collect evidence to establish its ownership in Kalapani up to Limpiyadhura and in Susta area after publishing the map and passing the bill in the lower house,” the person cited above said.Describing Nepal’s new map as a “tool for political gains”, the person added: “The Nepal government’s unilateral act of updating the map and the hasty effort to amend the constitution in Parliament reflect the intention of Prime Minister Oli and his government to politicise the boundary issue.“These actions do not reflect any seriousness on their part to resolve the issue through dialogue, and these actions are myopic and self-serving to further a limited political agenda.”Despite the border row, India remains committed to cooperating with Nepal on key humanitarian and connectivity projects, including rail links, and on the Covid-19 crisis, the people said. So far, India has provided medicines and equipment worth more than Rs 4.5 crore to Nepal to fight the Coronavirus, they said.The people also dismissed Oli’s repeated comments that Covid-19 was being spread in Nepal by people coming from India, describing them as “false and distorted”. Only a small portion of the 8 million Nepalese citizens living in India had returned home, they said. They noted that even as the constitutional amendment regarding the map was being discussed in Parliament, there were protests in Kathmandu over the Oli government’s handling of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/onus-on-nepal-govt-to-create-positive-atmosphere-for-talks-on-border-row-report/story-WcSIAAD43yjERpRwVOMcMI.html

One-week quarantine is a must for all who visit the state for longer duration but people who come for a shorter period (less than 10 days), will have to follow certain guidelines to avoid quarantine.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.According to the new guidelines, all travellers will have to get themselves registered in the government portal giving details of the visit for entry pass. They have to furnish the purpose of the visit, itinerary, details of contact persons and any deviation from the given information will have to be informed to the district authorities promptly.After applying in the portal the district collector concerned approves it and travellers are not supposed to meet or attend any other functions other than the itinerary given in the application. They will also not be able to extend their stay in the state without getting prior permission from the authorities.The government insists that there are strong reasons to impose strict restrictions after it found that more than 85 per cent of the recent cases involved expatriates and people from other states.Among 82 fresh cases 49 are expatriates, 23 came from other states and nine infected from primary sources. The sample of a 67-year-old man in Thiruvananthapuram who died on June 12 was tested positive taking the total death toll to 21 in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-issues-travel-guidelines-for-short-stay-in-state-amid-pandemic/story-ZbjWWZs2oAFFfTBvfhI0IN.html
15-06-2020||India||2 ‘missing’ Indian staffers released by Pakistan, have visible injuries: Official||Two Indian high commission staffers who went missing on Monday morning have been handed over at Islamabad’s secretariat police station, barely 2 km from the Indian mission. The two staffers have visible injury marks, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times. They were handed over to two Indian high commission officials who had gone to Islamabad’s Secretariat police station to take their custody. The two staffers, who had gone missing soon after they stepped out of the high commission on Monday morning, shall undergo a medical examination to confirm that they are well and record their visible injuries.Pakistan had claimed, nearly seven hours after the two staffers had gone missing, that they had been arrested in a “hit and run” road accident case.For most of Monday, Pakistan’s foreign office and its diplomats in the Indian capital told New Delhi that they were “looking into the matter”.The claim that the embassy staffers - a driver and a Central Industrial Security Force personnel - had been detained in a road accident case was reported in the Pakistani media several hours later. Quoting police sources, Pakistan’s SAMAA TV said the high commission car had been involved in a road accident and the two occupants were caught by the public when they were trying to get away. It is after reports in Pakistani media on these lines emerged that New Delhi decided to summon Pakistan’s charge d’affaires Syed Haider Shah to the external affairs ministry and reminded him that it was the responsibility of the government of Pakistan to ensure the safety and security of the diplomatic mission’s personnel.Haider Shah was also told that there should be no interrogation or harassment of the Indian officials. “The Pakistani side was asked to return the two officials along with the official car to the High Commission immediately,” a government source said.Indian officials said the sequence of events that led to the arrest of the two staffers would be available only after their de-briefing. “We will then also know if they were mistreated by Pakistani security officials,” one official said, adding that prima facie, the staffers appear to have been assaulted.The detention of the two staffers is seen as a retaliation for the expulsion of two officials posted at Pakistan’s high commission in Delhi on a charge of espionage a fortnight back. The three Pakistan high commission staffers were caught in central Delhi’s Karol Bagh market for trying to procure classified information relating to the movement of army troops.Already, Pakistan’s security personnel had been harassing and obstructing Indian diplomats in Islamabad from discharging their duties after the expulsion of its staffers for espionage. Pakistani security and intelligence personnel have been aggressively tailing vehicles of Indian diplomats including chargé d’affaires Gaurav Ahluwalia, and behaving in an intimidating manner outside their residences in Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-indian-officials-missing-for-7-hrs-being-held-at-pak-police-station-2-km-away/story-5lCDQzSjU7rrNLARURtVDP.html

However, hundreds turned up at the wedding including, several political heavyweights such as health and family welfare minister B Sriramulu, former deputy CM Dr G Parmeshwara as well as leader of opposition in the Assembly Siddaramiah who greeted the newlywed couple.In a video clip which emerged after the wedding, Siddaramiah is seen chiding Naik for not abiding by the law. Subsequently following a complaint by Hagribommanhalli tehsildar Nagaveni, the Arasikere police filed a case naming Bharat Naik as the first accused and Parameshwar Naik as the second accused of violating government norms.Naik later pleaded helplessness. “What can I do if people turn out in hundreds out of love for me and my family. I had appealed to them not to come but can I turn away people who have come to a function?”An official attached to Arasikere police station who did not want to be identified, said, “A case has been registered following a complaint by the Tehisldar. We are trying to get details and will be able to comment only after we have all the facts.”This is the second VIP wedding during the pandemic which has attracted criticism for failing to adhere to disaster control norms. Earlier hundreds had similarly gathered at the wedding of Yuva Janata Dal leader Nikhil Kumaraswamy the son of former Chief Minister H D Kumaraswamy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-against-senior-congress-leader-after-hundreds-gather-at-son-s-wedding/story-pR0f8doP4c8XZi5SxQJq2I.html

The airport commenced its domestic flight operations from May 25, with restrictions from the state government to handle 25 departures and 25 arrivals. The airport operator-- Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL) said, “Starting June 16, the airport is permitted to cater to a total of 100 domestic commercial passenger flight movements which includes 50 departures and 50 arrivals.”Unlike other airports, the Mumbai airport was seeing 25 departures and 25 arrival flights as the state government had not permitted more flights to operate to and from the city. This was done as a precautionary step to avoid the spread of Covid-19 to and from other states. The 25 departure flights mostly operated to places like Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Varanasi, Kochi, Gorakhpur, Jaipur, Patna and Hyderabad. “The move will see an increase in the sectors that we are currently handling. We are glad about the new progress that has come in favour of CSMIA, and we continue to relentlessly work towards ensuring the safety of our passengers and smooth functioning at the airport,” a MIAL spokesperson said. The airport received permission to extend its operations from 50 to 100 flight movements on Monday before which the airlines had already scheduled their flights according to the restrictions. “The airport operator has alerted all the airlines about the development and a revised scheduled of flights that will be operated on Tuesday will be made. This relaxation in the restriction is a big relief to all the stranded passengers who have not been able to fly back to their destinations,” said an airport source.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-airport-to-handle-100-domestic-flights-from-tomorrow/story-t9HaiDn4j6joydjMOZkBoK.html

Some top leaders of the TMC refused to comment saying that only O’Brien can comment as he had shared the picture.The picture showed some people carrying relief material on a boat after Cyclone Amphan. A Kolkata-based organization, however, said that the relief material was sent by them and they had shared the pictures with O’Brien.On May 26, the CPI(M)’s West Bengal committee first shared the picture saying that ‘our comrades’ have started relief and restoration work.“#Amphan has caused devastating damage in WB midst of a grim struggle combating the #Covid-19. Our comrades have started relief and rehabilitation work. These photos are from Hasnabad. We demand immediate declaration of national calamity by Central Govt. #RedVolunteers,” wrote the CPI(M), West Bengal committee on its official twitter handle while sharing the picture on May 26.Five days later on May 31, TMC’s national spokesperson shared the same picture from his twitter handle. Even though he mentioned that the government was providing relief, nowhere did O’Brien state that the picture was related to relief operations carried out by the state. He wrote: “Sharing some pics taken a week ago #Sunderbans a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Rs 6250 crore relief from #Bengal govt for the state, including Rs 20,000 each for restoration of up to 10 lakh homes lost or destroyed in #Amphan”Super Cyclone Amphan, the first super cyclone in the Bay of Bengal after the super cyclone that hit Odisha in 1999, had hit the Bengal coast on May 20, killing 98 people and affecting more than 10 crore in eight districts. The CPI(M) had written that the picture was of relief operations that were being carried out at Hasnabad, one of the worst-hit areas in the Sunderbans.The Bharatiya Janata Party lashed out at the TMC for this saying that the ruling party has hardly provided any relief and hence they don’t have any pictures to share. “The TMC has hardly provided any relief to the people. From where will they get the pictures of relief work? Hence they are borrowing it from CPI(M). They are busy in looting relief material,” said Dilip Ghosh,||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rivals-cpi-m-tmc-share-similar-pictures-of-relief-operations-after-cyclone-amphan-trigger-row/story-BvRhAZLN8Furc9OWvFJvlL.html

This is the first time that a senior minister of government has interacted live with citizens who had filed grievances related to the pandemic and also paved way for other ministries to take up citizen grievances in an effective manner along with a feedback mechanism, the statement issued by the Personnel Ministry said.“The feedback call centres would seek feedback from individual citizens on citizen satisfaction on 1.28 lakh Covid-19 public grievances that have been filed on CPGRAMS (Centralized Public Grievance Redress and Monitoring System) for the period March 30, 2020 to May 30, 2020,” it said. Singh complimented the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances (DARPG) on reaching the milestone of redressing over one lakh Covid-19 public grievances so far.He said that Covid 19 pandemic has created a world of digital opportunities to empower India’s citizens and DARPG must make best use of the crisis led reforms in coming days. Singh said that the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has inspired the government to put in a lot of effort to address grievances of common man.The DARPG has in collaboration with BSNL operationalised feedback call centres in Bhubaneswar, Guwahati, Jamshedpur, Vadodara, Ahmedabad, Lucknow, Ajmer, Guntur, Coimbatore and Guntakal with 1,406 call centre operators, the statement said.Feedback call centres would operate in several languages including Hindi, English, Gujarati, Marathi, Punjabi, Kannada, Konkani, Malayalam, Tamil, Telugu, Oriya, Bengali, Assamese and Rajasthani, the statement said.On the occasion, Singh interacted with four citizens whose grievances were redressed on the Covid-19 national monitor within a period of three days.

Amongst the steps taken were the implementation of CPGRAMS reforms in top 20 grievance receiving ministries/departments delineating last mile grievance officers, integration of state/union territories grievance portals with CPGRAMS and feedback call centres, the minister said. Singh said DARPG should bring out a compendium of success stories on successfully redressed public grievances which may be disseminated for restoring confidence in citizens that the government is sensitive to their issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-receives-over-1-lakh-covid-related-grievances-jitendra-singh-launches-feedback-call-centres/story-vbbDqvnD77j4QYW8QiObwL.html
15-06-2020||India||Telangana caps cost of Covid-19 tests, treatment at private hospitals||The Telangana government on Monday capped the cost of Covid-19 tests and treatment at private labs and hospitals across the state and said there were no plans to reimpose lockdown restrictions in the state.State health minister Eatala Rajender told reporters that the private labs authorised by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the state would not charge more than Rs 2,200 per person for a single Covid-19 diagnostic test.Similarly, the bed charges in private hospitals, including corporate hospitals cannot exceed Rs 4,000 per day in normal wards, Rs 7,500 in Intensive Care Units (ICU) without ventilator and Rs 9,000 with ventilator support.However, the private hospitals would be permitted to collect additional charges for the anti-viral drugs when the patients are on ventilator. Some anti-viral injections would cost up to Rs 50,000, he said.The tests would be done as per the ICMR guidelines, said the minister, adding any suspected patient can undergo a test. However, all positive cases don’t have to get admitted to the hospitals. The asymptomatic patients who test positive would have to be under home quarantine only, unless they develop severe symptoms.KCR on Sunday night announced that in the next one week to ten days, the health department will conduct tests on 50,000 people in 30 Assembly constituencies in and around the capital city.The minister said the health department was establishing a link between private health care establishments and the government authorities for sharing of information related to number of tests, positive and negative cases and number of persons who are admitted at private hospitals.“The private hospitals would have to upload the information about the tests and treatment on the health department portal,” he said.Rajender advised the private labs not to unnecessarily conduct tests for Covid-19 on people who don’t have symptoms. “As far as possible, people could get tested in government labs if they have any symptoms. If they really want to go to private labs, it is their wish,” he said.The government would not take up rapid testing, said the minister, but would continue with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. Mass testing would be done in several parts of Hyderabad and other containment zones in the state which reported a high number of cases.The department will do surveillance on each household in Hyderabad to prevent the spread of the deadly disease, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-caps-cost-of-covid-19-tests-treatment-at-private-hospitals/story-a85C30NGhbDRH5dfGpHg5J.html

The same region had recorded an earthquake of 5.5 magnitude with a depth of 10 kilometres at the latitude and the longitude 23.3 and 70.4, respectively, at 8:13 pm the previous evening.While the Gandhinagar-based Institute of Seismological Research (ISR) reported recording of several aftershocks on Monday, the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) recorded one aftershock (a smaller earthquake that follows a big earthquake at the same location) of 4.1 magnitude at 12:57 pm at the same location as Sunday’s epicentre.“This was the only significant aftershock we could record. We cannot predict or forecast if there will be more. Earthquake prediction is not possible with respect to space, time and magnitude,” said JL Gautam, head (operations) at NCS.Gautam said the earthquakes on Sunday and Monday were close to the epicentre of 2001 tremors in Kutch, also called the Bhuj earthquake, which had killed over 30,000 people and destroyed more than 40,000 buildings and other infrastructure.“The earthquake occurred on the Kachchch Mainland Fault. Its epicentre is close to the epicentre of the 2001 earthquake. A 5.5 magnitude earthquake can destroy weak buildings, but this time it’s unlikely to have caused any damage because the villages were rebuilt after the Bhuj earthquake,” Gautam had said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/earthquake-tremors-of-5-5-magnitude-felt-in-gujarat-s-kutch-region/story-f8Kk9yq0cfUOzkE4HQK6hM.html

While the body of her six-year old son floated in the tank by 6 am, the body of nine-year old daughter was fished out in the afternoon, a police official in Suryapet town police station said.“We have taken her into custody and are questioning her to know the reasons behind her extreme step,” the police official said.The woman hails from a village in Suryapet district and her husband is from Hyderabad. They married 14 years ago and had two children. The couple was living in a rented house in Suryapet, where he has been working in an iron scrap shop.Preliminary inquiries by the police revealed that the woman had a quarrel with her husband over some petty issue. “Of late, the husband had been habituated to drinking alcohol and this was the cause of quarrel between the two,” the police said.At around 10 pm on Sunday, the woman, after quarrelling with her husband, came to the tank along with the two kids. “She first pushed the two children into the tank and after some time, she too, wanted to jump but changed her mind at the last moment. She collapsed there and cried for her children all through the night,” the police official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/woman-drowns-two-kids-after-quarrel-with-drunken-husband-in-telangana-cops/story-3qr8dMh4XZ6zJaBXdJbNHN.html

In such cases, after the receipt of the payment via bank transfers, the fraudulent vendors do not make any delivery of items.The top investigative body also issued an alert based on Interpol inputs on instances of the use of methanol for preparing spurious hand sanitisers. Many incidents have been reported in other countries wherein, due to a huge demand for hand sanitisers during the Covid-19 pandemic, the use of methanol was detected to produce fake hand sanitisers. Methanol can be highly toxic and dangerous for the human body.This comes at a time when the entire country is struggling with a rising number of Covid-19 cases with the national tally jumping to 332,424.Last month, the CBI had sent an alert to states against a malicious software threat that uses an update related to Covid-19 pandemic. The alert was about banking trojan Cerberus that lures smartphone users into downloading malicious links related to Covid-19 and then infects devices to do phishing activities. The banking trojan known as Cerberus takes advantage of the Covid-19 pandemic and sends SMS to lure a user into downloading the link containing the malicious software, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-alerts-states-against-online-scams-methanol-laced-fake-sanitisers-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-Ili0MQM6eobespY0OueFLO.html

The Railways, has so far received a demand for coaches from Uttar Pradesh, Telangana and the Delhi government. The rest of the deployment will be done as and when states demand them, he added.The isolation coaches will be under the complete care of the chief medical officer of the state government, in the states where they will be deployed.For national capital Delhi, at least 50 coaches with 800 beds have already been stationed at Shakur Basti railway station.No isolation coaches or beds are in use so far in Delhi.“Another 500 more such isolation coaches for Covid-19 patients have to be deployed in Delhi and we are finalizing the stations where they can be kept,” Yadav said.The Railway Board chairman said it is more suitable to use non-AC coaches for isolation purposes of suspected or confirmed Covid-19 patients. For cooling, wherever required the Railways will provide roof insulation in the coaches, he added.“Last night we had a request from the Maharashtra state government to run suburban trains. We have allowed the Central and Western Railways to run some trains for essential workers, and e-passes will be issued by the state government for the same,” he said.Referring to the Shramik Special trains run by the Railways to transport migrants back to their home states, the Railway Board chairman said, “We have transported more than 60 lakh migrants till date. Only a few migrants are left now. We had asked state governments to send us their demand of remaining trains on June 3 and we received a demand for 171 Shramik Special trains from various states.”“We ended up running 222 Shramik Special trains till June 14. After the Supreme Court’s order we have again sought their need from the state governments to meet the additional demand,” Yadav said.“The average fare for Shramik Special trains was Rs 600 and around 60 lakh migrants have travelled so the total revenue can be calculated through that. The fare was as per normal mail express trains.

The security forces are combing the forests and hillocks of Dachigam wildlife sanctuary and nearby areas.The security forces are also using electronic surveillance equipment and unmanned aerial vehicles to scan the area, officials said.A senior police officer confirmed a combing operation was underway in the forests of Dachigam. “Yes, it’s a general area domination operation launched by the forces,” he said.The troops started by searching for militants areas in the upper reaches of Dachigam and places close to the wildlife sanctuary. The forests and mountainous terrain of this area have been used in the past by militants to enter Srinagar and south Kashmir after coming in from Bandipore and Lolab areas.Officials said the search operation is part of efforts to secure the areas along the route of the Amarnath Yatra, especially Ganderbal and Srinagar districts. This year, the pilgrimage will be held for a brief period from next month and a limited number of pilgrims will be allowed to trek to the Amarnath shrine via the Baltal route, considered the shortest but toughest route. Local residents said search operations in Gandernal and the outskirts of the city could increase in coming days to secure the tracks and routes used by yatris. Besides, security forces have received intelligence inputs about the presence of militants in the area.“This is a usual operation to scan the forests and if there are any militants in Dachigam or adjoining areas and forests, they will be flushed out,” an official privy to details said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/search-operation-underway-in-dachigam-forests-to-trace-militants/story-p3RcoVS7d0VfeYALHJziIM.html

This is probably the first time since Covid-19 outbreak in March that a Pakistani diplomat has been summoned by India.It was made clear to the Pakistani envoy that, say sources, that there should be no interrogation or harassment of the Indian officials. The responsibility for the safety and security of the concerned diplomatic personnel lay squarely with the Pakistani authorities, the source added.The Pakistan side was asked to return the two officials along with the official car to the high commission immediately, the source further said.Officials said the two Indian staffers posted at the Islamabad mission had stepped out for some work on Monday morning. When they did not reach their destination, high commission officials informed New Delhi and Pakistan’s foreign office.“The Pakistani side has claimed that they are still looking into the matter,” a senior government official said.The disappearance of Indian staffers comes just weeks after the expulsion of two Pakistan high commission officials who were caught for spying and made to go back.Pakistani agencies, say officials, started harassment of high commission officials in Islamabad soon after.Indian diplomats, including chargé d’affaires Gaurav Ahluwalia, have been harassed and aggressively tailed by Pakistani security personnel. High Commission officials have also complained about intimidating behaviour by the Pakistani personnel outside their residences.India has been firing note verbales to Pakistan’s foreign office ever since, reminding Islamabad that the behaviour of its security personnel violates the the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations 1961 and the 1992 pact between the two countries that lists the code of conduct for treatment of diplomatic and consular personnel. The last one was sent on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-envoy-summoned-after-indian-staffers-go-missing-in-islamabad/story-ygLX0y3XAsUK1rqvmnIMMN.html

Polling on 6th July 2020. Last Date of making nominations: 25th June, 2020,” a tweet from the Press Information Bureau (PIB) said.A press release by the EC said that the election is being held to fill one “casual vacancy” in the Andhra Pradesh Legislative Council since a member Dokka Manikya Vara Prasad resigned on Marh 9. His term was scheduled to end on March 29, 2023.The council works like Rajya Sabha. Once in two years, one-third of its members retire and new members are elected by local bodies representatives, assembly members, graduates, and teachers. Some members are also nominated.The council was revived in 2007 after a gap of nearly 20 years.But the present YSR Congress government passed a resolution in the legislative assembly in January this year to again abolish the Upper House.Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy said that the Council has become meaningless and a hurdle for passing laws. He pointed out how the Telugu Desam Party (TDP) having a majority in the Council stalled two bills seeking to create three capitals and also that on the introduction of English medium in government schools.Reddy said the government was incurring Rs 60 crore expenditure annually on the Council. He said the poor state cannot afford it anymore.The resolution was later sent to the Union home ministry, which will have to introduce a bill in Parliament for the Council’s abolition. The exercise may take a year, officials said.Andhra Pradesh had its first legislative council from 1958 to 1985 when the then N T Rama Rao government abolished it. Reddy’s father, Y S Rajasekhar Reddy, restored the council in 2007 when he was the chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-pradesh-legislative-council-election-to-be-held-on-july-6/story-9Ag4pwcDIde4WgISdvZx7L.html

The bench noted that all precautionary measures, as stipulated with regard to passengers and the crew, are complied with by all flight operators. Upon disembarkment, thermal screening of all passengers is again carried out and they are thereafter compulsorily placed under institutional quarantine for seven to 14 days. It is not established till date that any passenger, who tested positive, has been infected on board an aircraft, the court said. It further said even if the middle seat is kept vacant, the person occupying the window seat, while getting out for going to the washroom and thereafter returning to the seat, is likely to touch the person sitting on the aisle seat. The court noted that a high-level expert committee of the Ministry of Civil Aviation has specifically considered and rejected the suggestion that seats must be kept vacant between passengers.

15-06-2020||India||Temperature over India likely to rise by over 4 degrees Celsius by end of 21st century: Govt report||The average temperature over India is projected to rise by 4.4 degrees Celsius, while the intensity of heat waves is likely to increase by 3-4 times by the end of the century, according to a government report on the impact of climate change on the country.India’s average temperature has risen by around 0.7 degree Celsius during 1901–2018, largely on account of Green House Gases-induced warming, states the report by the Ministry of Earth Sciences. It is likely to be published by Science and Technology Minister Harsh Vardhan on Tuesday.The report has been prepared by the Centre for Climate Change Research, a cell under MoES’ Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune. “By the end of the twenty-first century, average temperature over India is projected to rise by approximately 4.4 degrees Celsius,” the report states. In the 30-year period between 1986 and 2015, temperatures of the warmest day and the coldest night of the year have risen by about 0.63 degrees Celsius and 0.4 degree Celsius, respectively. By the end of the century, the temperatures of the warmest day and the coldest night are projected to rise by approximately 4.7 degrees Celsius and 5.5 degrees Celsius, respectively, according to the report.The frequencies of occurrence of warm days and warm nights are projected to increase by 55 per cent and 70 per cent, it says.“The frequency of summer (April–June) heat waves over India is projected to be 3 to 4 times higher by the end of the twenty-first century,” the report states. The average duration of heat wave events is also projected to approximately double. The combined rise in surface temperature and humidity, amplification of heat stress is expected across India, particularly over the Indo-Gangetic and Indus river basins, the report notes. Sea Surface Temperature (SST) of the tropical Indian Ocean has risen by a degree Celsius on average during 1951–2015, markedly higher than the global average SST warming of 0.7 degree Celsius, over the same period, the report states. Sea Surface Temperatures does have an influence over the Indian Ocean. The Indian Ocean Dipole is linked to the SSTs of the Indian Ocean. A positive IOD, linked to the cooling/warming of the Indian Ocean waters, generally helps to have a good monsoon. Sea-level in the North Indian Ocean (NIO) has risen at a rate of 1.06–1.75 millimetre per year during 1874–2004 and has accelerated to 3.3 millimetre per year in the last two and a half decades (1993–2017), which is comparable to the current rate of global mean sea-level rise.At the end of the twenty-first century, steric sea level in the NIO is projected to rise by approximately 300 millimetres relative to the average over 1986–2005. The summer monsoon precipitation (June to September) over India has also declined by around 6 per cent from 1951 to 2015, with notable decreases over the Indo-Gangetic Plains and the Western Ghats, the report further states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/temperature-over-india-likely-to-rise-by-over-4-degress-celsius-by-end-of-21st-century-govt-report/story-ZsXcDjcYv7DiHWG7F8egGO.html

He made the remarks while addressing the member of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in Uttarakhand.“Our army has Gorkha Regiment whose soldiers have displayed valour and courage on numerous times for the country. Its war cry is ‘Jai Maha Kali, Ayo Re Gorkhali (Hail Mother Kali, here comes the Gorkha)’ and Maha Kali is also in Kolkata, Kamakhya and Vindhyachal with devotees all around India. Then how can the ties between the two countries break?” Singh said in his address to BJP members of Garhwal division. The statement comes days after the Nepal Parliament passed the country’s new political map showing key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as their own. The Nepal government decided to amend its map after the inauguration of a crucial road connecting Lipulekh Pass and Dharchula area by Singh in Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhand. Nepal had raised strong objection, claiming the road passes through its territory. ALSO WATCH | Nepal parliament approves new map, India’s defence expert smells China’s role“Indo-Nepal ties are not an ordinary one. We have a relation of ‘Roti and Beti’ which cannot be broken by any power of the world,” Singh said in reference to the strong people-to-people connect between the two countries. Speaking on the ties between the two countries, the defence minister also mentioned the ‘spiritual relations’ citing highly revered Pashupatinath temple in Nepal.“We don’t have just geographical, historical or social relations with Nepal but a spiritual one also. Who can forget Baba Pashupatinath? How can he be separated from Baba Amarnath, Somnath and Kashi Vishwanath? This relation is not from this world but a totally another world,” he said. Singh suggested that there have been some misconceptions on Lipulekh on Nepal’s part “which would be solved through dialogue.”“If there are some misconceptions on the road between Lipulekh and Dharchula among Nepal’s people, then we will sit together and solve those issues through dialogue. And I can say this with full confidence that no Indian has any hatred towards Nepal as the relation is so deep between us,” said Singh. Earlier during the event, he also hailed the steps taken under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership to fight the Covid-19 pandemic. “PM Modi took the difficult challenge of fighting the pandemic and so far has taken many bold and crucial decisions to contain it. Those efforts have not only been lauded by the other countries but WHO itself,” he said. The Defence minister said, “Our government under PM Modi also strengthened the health safety infrastructure within a short period of time in the pandemic. As a result, we are now not only producing the PPE kits for our health workers but are exporting them to other countries also. We are sure that together we will soon win this fight.”The virtual rally was also attended by Union human resource department minister Ramesh Pokhriyal Nishank, Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat, BJP national vice-president Shyam Jajoo and other party leaders through video conferencing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-can-india-nepal-ties-break-in-rajnath-singh-s-speech-references-to-gorkhas-and-spiritual-connect/story-jRdpEpWCCWj6EUTPDfOy3J.html

The kits will allow faster diagnosis without laboratory examination Standard Q Covid-19 Ag detection kit (rapid antigen test kits) is a rapid chromatographic immunoassay for qualitative detection of specific antigens to SARS-CoV-2. It has been developed by SD Biosensor, a South Korea based company, the ICMR said in an advisory. Suspected individuals who test negative for Covid-19 by rapid antigen test should be tested sequentially by RT-PCR to rule out infection, whereas a positive test should be considered as a true positive and does not need reconfirmation by RT-PCR test, said ICMR said.The Standard Q Covid-19 Ag detection can be interpreted as positive or negative after 15 minutes of putting the sample into the well by appearance of test and control lines, which can be read with a naked eye, requiring no specialized equipment, it said. The maximum duration for interpreting a positive or negative test is 30 minutes. After that the test strip should be discarded, it said. In view of its high specificity while relatively low sensitivity, ICMR recommends the use of Standard Q Covid-19 Ag detection assay as a point of care diagnostic assay for testing under (containment zones and healthcare settings) settings in combination with the gold standard RT-PCR test, the advisory said.The ICMR further said that the Standard Q Covid-19 Ag rapid antigen detection test has a very high specificity (i.e. ability to detect true negatives). “Specificity ranged from 99.3 per cent to 100 per cent at the two sites. Sensitivity of the test (i.e. ability to detect true positives) ranged from 50.6 per cent to 84 per cent in two independent evaluations, depending upon the viral load of the patient. Higher viral load correlated with higher sensitivity,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-recommends-use-of-rapid-antigen-kits-for-testing-in-containment-zones-healthcare-settings/story-3vjXq6LfrEKJ5Atn0IXxHO.html

By Monday noon, the tally further increased to 4,159.The state’s Covid-19 tally was 2,000 on June 4; it took just 10 days for the figure to double. Assam recorded its first Covid-19 case on March 31 and it took nearly two months to reach 1,000 cases on May 29.While the graph for infections is rising sharply - around 200-250 new cases daily since June 4 - the recovery rate has also shown an upward trend. A total of 460 patients had recovered in the state on June 4. The figure was 1,961 on June 14.The sharp rise has been attributed to return of nearly 2.5 lakh people to the state from other parts of the country. The migrants started arriving in Assam on May 4 when inter-state movement resumed.“I am expecting a further spike in cases in the next few days as nearly 25,000 more people are expected to reach the state by trains. Seventeen of these trains would come from Kerala and two from Karnataka,” Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma told journalists on Saturday. Other states in the North-East have also recorded a spike, due to homecoming of returnees. Tripura, with 1,079 Covid-19 cases, has the second highest tally in the region followed by Manipur with 458 cases till Sunday. Nagaland has 168 cases, Mizoram 117, Arunachal Pradesh 91 and Meghalaya 44.Guwahati could be under lockdownWhile the number of Covid-19 cases in Assam is increasing rapidly, the government is more concerned about the state’s and the region’s biggest city Guwahati where over two dozen cases without any travel or contact history have been detected till date.“The situation in Guwahati is a bit critical as we have 25 cases without any history. It is worrying and we have decided to increase our surveillance mechanism,” Sarma said on Saturday.From June 15, the state government has decided to conduct 50,000 tests till the end of the month to check possible community spread of the disease. Tests would be carried out at petrol pumps, loading, unloading and parking sites of trucks coming from outside, eateries on highways, weigh bridges etc.“We have a suspicion that most cases without history have some connection to these places frequented by truckers from outside the state. As per Centre’s guidelines, the truck drivers and attendants are not tested for Covid-19 and are allowed to leave without spending time in quarantine,” said Sarma.Residents who feel that they have some Covid-19 related symptoms can also visit 12 healthcare centres across the city and get themselves tested free of cost.“If we see the situation deteriorating and if we get a sizeable number of positive cases in the 50,000 tests residents of Guwahati will have to be ready for another lockdown. If we have to take tough decisions, we will not shy away from it,” Sarma said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-s-covid-19-cases-double-in-10-days-tally-now-at-4-159/story-9TkZCytkB0TgypwogWmrJJ.html

The first family was, however, allowed to see his funeral over a video call.Naresh Akula, who played as a mid-fielder, represented Odisha in the Santosh Trophy, India’s premier state level football tournament, three times from 2006 to 2008. He represented Oil and Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC) in the reputed I-League.Aula, who worked as security supervisor in ONGC since 2009, was posted to Silchar a couple of years ago after serving in Mumbai for a decade. A formidable midfielder, Naresh represented Odisha three times in 2006, 2007 and 2008 in the Santosh Trophy before he started playing for the ONGC at the reputed I-league.The night before he died, he had reportedly spoken to his family staying in the Bhanjanagar area of Ganjam district and expressed his desire to come back home. His elder brother Bishnu Aula, who spoke to him, said he had advised the footballer to put off the visit as he was likely to be put in quarantine for 14 days upon arrival due to raging coronavirus pandemic. The next morning, his family - which included his wife Arathi, his parents and other siblings - in Bhanjanagar were told that he had passed away in a hospital at Silchar.“When we spoke to the ONGC officials asking them to send my brother’s body to our home, we were told that a woman from Mizoram, named Lal Muan Kui, is a claimant for the body as her name was listed as my brother’s wife in the official records. We were shocked as my brother was already married (since 2012) and has a four-year-old daughter,” said Bishnu.As the wait for the body went on till evening that day, the family contacted the office of the union ministry of petroleum and natural gas, the parent ministry of the ONGC. “We were told that a decision will be taken. We sent the video clip of my brother’s marriage as well as the photo of her daughter on WhatsApp seeking the ministry’s intervention. However, on June 11 night we were told that the body has been sent to Mizoram as in the ONGC records his legally wedded wife’s name was not there,” he said.The family was however allowed a small concession as they could see Naresh’s burial ceremony over video calling. “We were too shocked to react,” said his father Alabandru Aula.The footballer’s family said they would meet petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan seeking his intervention in the case.The footballer’s elder brother said the family came to know about the presence of another woman in his life four years ago after some of the fellow footballers informed them about it. “However, he kept dodging our queries. Our suspicion increased when he stopped coming to Odisha one and half years ago citing work pressure,” said his brother.Naresh also played for the Maharashtra state football team.An ONGC spokesman said he would look into the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/footballer-dies-1st-wife-shocked-after-body-sent-to-official-spouse/story-GQgsY3sUmOueruPoEPjpVK.html

The minister said that the road built by the Border Roads Organization (BRO) in Lipulekh is “very much part of the Indian territory”. Singh’s comments came after the government of Nepal, over the weekend, got a unanimous approval of its lower house in parliament to a new map depicting disputed areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as Nepalese territories.India reacted, stating that such “artificial enlargement” of territorial claim is untenable. Some misconception has risen in Nepal regarding this road. But I would like to say that as far as Nepal is concerned, we not only have social, geographical, historical or cultural relations with them but also a devotional relation. India can never forget this: Defence Minister https://t.co/9fEFYp7TPbRakesh Sood, who was Indian Ambassador to Nepal from 2008 to 2011, said both sides have allowed the relationship to come to a “very very dangerous point” and that India should have found time to engage with Kathmandu as it pressed for talks on the issue since November.“I think we have displayed a lack of sensitivity, and now the Nepalese have dug themselves deeper into the hole from which they will find it difficult to come out,” he told news agency PTI.Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday addressed the Jammu Jan Samvad virtual rally during which he talked about the Modi government’s commitment towards the growth and development of Jammu and Kashmir in the coming years. “Just wait, soon people of PoK will demand that they want to be with India and not under the rule of Pakistan, and the day this happens, a goal of our Parliament will also be accomplished,” he said yesterday.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bound-by-roti-beti-rajnath-singh-says-india-nepal-ties-are-unbreakable-beyond-ordinary/story-Yp0U5Hd5vRe9dyC1zNRIbJ.html

15-06-2020||India||Arunachal Pradesh district gives ‘human face’ to care of Covid-19 patients||Doctors, nurses and other attendants at a Covid-19 care centre in Arunachal Pradesh’s Changlang district have started pasting their photographs on their personal protective equipment (PPE) kits allowing patients to know their care providers.Changlang, the second most populous district in Arunachal, recorded its first Covid-19 case on June 1. The district now has 55 positive cases, the highest among all districts in the state. Arunachal has a total of 91 cases until Sunday.“Patients in the centres are kept in isolation and they aren’t allowed to go out or meet anyone. Though there is a helpline which they can use, they don’t get to see a human face and even their care providers look the same as all are covered in PPE kits,” Devansh Yadav, Changlang’s deputy commissioner, said.“The patients are already in stress because of the disease. So we thought that since the doctors and other attendants talk to them regularly and they have a level of comfort with each other, the patients should get to know who are the ones taking care of them,” he added.Yadav, who is a doctor himself and did his MBBS from AIIMS, Delhi before joining the civil service, got the idea of pasting photos of caregivers on their PPEs from a friend based in New York.“My friend told me about this practice used by several hospitals there and how it brought some cheer to the patients. So when we started getting cases in our district from the beginning of June, we decided to implement it as no helpline can replace a human face,” said Yadav.“We have got some feedback from the Miao centre and it seems patients are happy to know the faces behind the PPE kits. From Monday, we will implement it in the other centres where Covid-19 patients are admitted,” he added.The district has eight Covid-19 care centres and three of them are being used to admit positive cases. The one in Miao is located nearly 100km away from the district headquarters and has half a dozen patients.“On the advice of the DC, we started printing photos of doctors and other care providers in A4 size papers and pasted them in front side of the PPE kits,” Dr Hensam Jongsam, the in-charge of the Miao centre, said.“The patients are nervous about the disease and their conditions. So there was not much of reaction from them, but once they are asked about it they give a positive opinion,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arunachal-pradesh-district-gives-human-face-to-care-of-covid-19-patients/story-V6ZFFFgKCxxcqy9hk8N4rJ.html

The Congress, which governs Rajasthan, has accused the BJP of attempting horse-trading ahead of the June 19 election, and has assembled its MLAs and legislators supporting the party-led government in the state in the hotel. The BJP has, however, dismissed the charge. The Congress has fielded K C Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi as its candidates. The numbers in the state assembly suggest that the Congress would win two seats in the Rajya Sabha elections on June 19 and the BJP one. But the BJP has fielded two candidates, triggering charges that it was counting on horse-trading. Rajasthan Congress president and deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot, who had gone to New Delhi on Saturday, had to stay back in the capital due to personal reasons, party leaders said. Pilot was to return to Rajasthan on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-congress-mlas-lodged-at-hotel-watch-mahatma-gandhi-movie-perform-yoga/story-9ubMMZORktF5ixBBNKYF1O.html

Police swung into action to track the central committee member of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) but found that they got the intelligence input a day late.Milind Baburao Teltumbde alias Deepak Teltumbde alias Jeeva is one of the senior-most functionaries of the CPI(Maoist) and special zone secretary for Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh (MMC) zone. Teltumbde has been given the task to create a new territory that allows rebels easy passage from east to west and vice-versa, and safe abode for the senior rebel leaders.Police officers said Teltumbde has been visiting the MMC areas regularly and has recruited about 200 locals for a commando unit, called Vistaar Dalam, of MMC. “Deepak is presently concentrating on training and developing human intelligence inside the MMC which the Maoists lack,” a senior police officer of Chhattisgarh said.Jitendra Shukla, Rajnandgaon’s superintendent of police (SP) who has been tracking him for long, said Teltumbde mostly lives in the jungles of Mandla, Rajnandgaon and Kawardha districts in Chhattisgarh, which comes under MMC zoneBut he has spent the past four months in the urban areas of Maharashtra for meeting party cadres and working out a strategy, Shukla said.“We have come to know that in Nagpur, he met many people most in an auto-rickshaw to prevent detection. Teltumbde has a good network in Vidharbha region especially in Nagpur,” he said.“Teltumbde never trusts anyone,” another Chhattisgarh police officer, who has created his digital profile based on interrogation of rebels, who worked with him in the recent past, said.A close aide of Teltumbde surrendered in 2019 in Rajnandgaon, which helped the police get information about his movement during Moaist operations in three states, mainly in Madhya Pradesh.“Well-informed and well-read, Deepak is always on the move. He knows the jungle in Madhya Pradesh and Maharashtra very well and it is not easy to catch him,” said the second senior police officer, adding that off-late he has developed health issues, which has restricted his movement.“Deepak is suffering from spondylitis because of which he has lost conscious while walking in the jungle. He has diabetes and his right knee has also been operated once,” he said.Teltumbde moves heavily-armed bodyguards and a platoon of Maoists in the jungles. According to senior Maoist leader Pahad Singh, who surrendered in 2018, he takes all the major decision of the zone.“He was the person who pushed the idea to develop Amarkantak as ‘base area’ of MMC, in a meeting in 2016, in which Central Committee Members (CCM) of the CPI(Maoists) including him were present,” a senior Indian Police officer (IPS) officer who interrogated Pahaad Singh, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/well-informed-well-read-deepak-teltumbade-is-the-man-tasked-to-form-new-maoists-zone/story-DElQNHrYtW9bKzneG9SbRP.html

Sushant Singh Rajput, who dropped out of an engineering college to pursue a career in Bollywood and delivered several hit films over the past decade, was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai on Sunday. He was 34.Dattatreya Bargude, an assistant commissioner of Mumbai Police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no “note” was found at his residence.“I cannot imagine how this happened. I request the government to launch a CBI inquiry. I think there is a deep conspiracy behind his death. Sushant cannot commit suicide,” Pappu Yadav told reporters.“I want a CBI inquiry in the matter. Sushant was a workaholic and good man, not the kind of person that would commit suicide. He rose from the bottom. Made Bihar proud.

15-06-2020||India||Maharashtra govt to consult local authorities ahead of video conference with PM||After resuming local train services for employees of essential and emergency services in Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), the Maharashtra government will this week assess the Covid-19 situation and decide on steps to be taken after the lockdown ends on June 30.Responding to repeated requests from the state government, the railways resumed suburban services on the Central and Western lines for workers of essential and emergency services from Monday. Employees of private essential services and state government employees are allowed to travel in special trains after showing their identity cards. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is scheduled to participate in a video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday. Before this conference, the state government is expected to assess the Covid-19 cases in various districts and the steps needed to bring the situation under control before the current lockdown ends. “There will be meetings with the district and civic administrations by the chief minister this week. Some of the districts have witnessed a spike in cases and deliberations on the containment of the spread are expected during the conference,” a state government official said on condition of anonymity. The state authorities have directed districts with a growing number of Covid-19 cases to augment medical infrastructure. The officer said Thackeray will also take stock of things after relaxations made under “Mission Begin Again” to decide on steps to be taken over the next few days. Thackeray has clarified no decision has been made on imposing a fresh lockdown in the state, but he warned the government will be forced to do so if existing restrictions are not followed. “The government is evaluating the situation. If we feel that the lifting of lockdown is life-threatening, then we will be forced to impose the lockdown again,” he had said last week.Thackeray is also expected to demand Central relief to cope with the damage caused by Cyclone Nisarga in coastal districts of Maharashtra. A Central team headed by joint secretary Ramesh Kumar Ganta is visiting Raigad and Ratnagiri over the next two days to assess the damage caused by the cyclone. “The assessment of the quantum of losses by our machinery will be completed soon and we will be in position to arrive at the relief expected from the Centre. On the basis of that, the chief minister may speak to the prime minister during their conference,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-govt-to-consult-local-authorities-ahead-of-video-conference-with-pm/story-XmtkI5IbYRf6E1E9BIg87L.html

There were 325 fatalities in the last 24 hours which takes the country’s death toll to 9,520, according to the health ministry.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIndia’s recovery rate continued to rise as 169,797 patients were cured of the deadly infection taking it to a little over 51% from Sunday’s 50.59%.The number of recovered Covid-19 patients in the worst-hit state of Maharashtra also went up with 50,978 people discharged from hospitals. Maharashtra’s case tally stood at 107,958 and the state reported 3,950 deaths so far.In Delhi, Union home minister Amit Shah has called another round of meeting. Shah will meet members of all political parties on Monday for further assessment of the pandemic situation in the Capital.Amit Shah had announced a comprehensive door-to-door survey in containment zones for contact tracing and promised the city 500 railway coaches having a capacity of 8,000 beds to treat Covid-19 patients to mitigate any possible shortage of beds.Delhi has recorded 41,182 infections, with 24,032 active cases, and 1,327 deaths. From Monday, June 8, to Sunday, the city has registered 12,246 cases. In the previous week—June 1-7— it had recorded 9,092 cases.In Tamil Nadu, the number of those affected by the respiratory disease stood at 44,661 and the state’s death toll is 435, according to the Union health ministry.Gujarat, another state which has contributed to the rising Covid-19 cases in India, has recorded 23,544 infections and 1,477 deaths till date.A new pre-print study has said the eight-week lockdown in India shifts the peak of the epidemic by 34-76 days and reduces the number of cases at the end of the lockdown by 69-97%The study was done by academics at the department of community medicine and School of Public health at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research and Education and Research, Chandigarh, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, ICMR. It was funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).India imposed a lockdown that was nearly 10 weeks long and some of the restrictions are still in place although many have been eased.The study, which is yet to be peer reviewed, also claimed that “intensification of public health surveillance measures with 60% effectiveness” would reduce the number of cases at the peak by 70% and cumulatively by 26.6%. Such measures would also reduce the requirement for ICU beds and ventilators by 83%, the study added.It puts the cost of managing Covid-19 in India at 4.5% of GDP in the absence of any “intervention” and 6.2% with “intensified public health measures.”It said that India’s health care infrastructure may prove inadequate later this year with the demand for isolation and ICU beds and ventilators exceeding supply in November even with “intensified public health measures with 60% effectiveness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-over-11-000-covid-19-cases-for-third-straight-day/story-DC2zcaoPWTG5DwGnXeVcjI.html

15-06-2020||India||From 11% to over 50%: How India’s Covid-19 recovery rate steadily improved in 2 months||India is the fourth worst-affected country by the coronavirus disease pandemic. The number of cases has already crossed the three-lakh mark.However, there is a relief as the recovery rate has improved in the country. According to the Union health ministry data, the recovery rate has now crossed 50 per cent with 1,62,378 patients cured so far, leaving 1,49,348 cases active.In fact, the recovery rate of Delhi and Mumbai is among the highest in the world. In New York, the worst-affected city in badly hit United States has seen 21.23 per cent people recovering from the disease. In New Jersey, this percentage is 18.88. In contrast, Delhi’s the recovery rate is 38.36 per cent and Mumbai has seen 45.65 per cent patients getting cured of the disease. However, the two cities have seen a wave of Covid-19 cases - Delhi recorded 2,224 cases on Sunday, the third consecutive day it has seen more than 2,000 new infections.The health ministry said that the healthy recovery rate was a result of “timely case identification” and “proper clinical management”.The recovery rate has been steadily increasing in the country. On May 19, India recovery rate from the coronavirus disease stood at 38.73 per cent. It improved to 40.32 per cent two days later - the first time India’s recovery rate crossed the milestone. Since then, it has been improving.On May 31, the health ministry had announced that the recovery rate in the country stands at 47.76 per cent. It further improced to 48.19 per cent on June 2. It stood at 11.42 per cent on April 15.India is faring much better than other worst-hit countries in terms of cases per million of population. India has recorded 234 cases per million of its population, the spread of the disease in other countries has been war greater - US (6,477/million), Brazil (4,004/million), Russia (3,625/million), UK (4,337/million).India is also placed much better in terms of numbers of deaths per million of population, which is 7 per million of India’s population currently. Other countries like the US (355/million), Brazil (201/million), Russia (48/million) and UK (614/million), had posted a higher number of deaths in ratio to their population.The health ministy said that Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) testing capacity for detecting Covid-19 cases is being ramped up continuously. In total, 893 laboratories - 646 government and 247 private - tested 56,58,614 swab samples till 9 am on Sunday (June 14) with 1,51,432 of them in the last 24 hours, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-11-to-over-50-how-india-s-covid-19-recovery-rate-steadily-improved-in-2-months/story-72WhG6yttPx3OTLi1f9MHN.html
15-06-2020||India||China, Pak possess more nuclear weapons than India: Defence think-tank SIPRI||China and Pakistan possess more nuclear weapons than India, according to a new yearbook released by a leading conflict and armaments think-tank on Monday.The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI)’s Yearbook 2020 pegs the number of nuclear warheads in the Chinese arsenal at 320, while the nuclear forces of Pakistan and India are estimated to have 160 and 150 weapons, respectively.The figures have been updated till January 2020.India and its neighbours were ranked in the same order by SIPRI last year too when China possessed 290 nuclear warheads, Pakistan 150-160 and India had 130-140 warheads at the start of 2019.The findings come at a time when India and China are caught in a border confrontation along the contested line of actual control in eastern Ladakh. Also, there is a noticeable military buildup on both sides of the border—stretching from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.China is carrying out “significant modernisation” of its nuclear arsenal and developing a “so-called nuclear triad for the first time” made up of new land and sea-based missiles and nuclear-capable fighter jets, the SIPRI said in a statement announcing the launch of the yearbook.“India and Pakistan are slowly increasing the size and diversity of their nuclear forces,” it said.The yearbook, which “assesses the current state of armaments, disarmament and international security”, found while there has been an overall decrease in the number of nuclear warheads in 2019, all nuclear weapon-possessing countries continue to modernise their nuclear arsenals. With 6,375 and 5,800 warheads, Russia and the United States together possess more than 90% of global nuclear weapons.The nine nuclear-armed countries—the US, Russia, the United Kingdom, France, China, India, Pakistan, Israel and North Korea—together account for an estimated 13,400 nuclear weapons as of January 2020.“This marked a decrease from the 13,865 nuclear weapons that SIPRI estimated these states possessed at the beginning of 2019. Around 3,720 of the nuclear weapons are currently deployed with operational forces and nearly 1,800 of these are kept in a state of high operational alert,” SIPRI’s statement said.It also highlighted low levels of transparency in reporting on nuclear weapon capabilities.“China now publicly displays its nuclear forces more frequently than in the past but releases little information about force numbers or future development plans,” the statement said.“The governments of India and Pakistan make statements about some of their missile tests but provide no information about the status or size of their arsenals,” it added.India was the third-biggest military spender in the world last year after the US and China, according to a SIPRI report released in April. It was the first time that two Asian countries featured among the top three military spenders.New Delhi’s defence spending grew by 6.8% to reach $71.1 billion in 2019, said the report on Trends in World in World Military Expenditure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-pakistan-possess-more-nuclear-weapons-than-india-defence-think-tank/story-phAp0fW2uJS4hovk4F77jL.html

He was 34. Dattatreya Bargude, assistant commissioner of police, confirmed the actor’s death and said that no ‘note’ was found at his residence. Abhishek Trimukhe, DCP, zone 9, said an accidental death report (ADR) was registered in the afternoon. Rajput’s death was condoled by people from all professions.“His rise in the world of entertainment inspired many and he leaves behind several memorable performances. Shocked by his passing away. My thoughts are with his family and fans,” tweeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Born in Bihar’s Patna, Rajput was the youngest of five children of a government employee. He completed his schooling in Delhi before securing a seat in an engineering college in the Capital in 2003. He dropped out of the course to pursue acting professionally three years later and joined the Barry John Acting School.

15-06-2020||India||Covid helped to open up about mental health||One central feature of human beings today is that they believe they can manage the toughest of situations. But the truth is, there’s a limit to engineering, innovation and management skills. Usually, our bodies reminds us of that limit. During the lockdown, there was much talk about mental health. It is true-seeing the rapid spread of Covid-19, lives lost, including people we know and the terror of being attacked, coupled with economic slowdown, has been terrifying for most people. It is only natural that many more people will be hit by mental health concerns.There’s one thing we should be aware of, however : the role of toxins in mental health. Heavy metals like Mercury, Lead and Arsenic and some pesticides, for example, have a known role to play in this matter. They add to the chemical burden of our brain and impact it in specific, deleterious ways, such as depression and anxiety.Covid-19 has helped India to open up about mental health. Of the many things we need to do, tightening regulations around toxics and public information is one. What we have to do is to strengthen our toxics reduction regime. We’ve got to phase out all three within a time period-many developing countries already have. In India, most paints and petrol have dumped lead. Dental amalgams are slowly shifting. But there’s a lot of work ahead. The Pesticides continue to be widely available which must be phased out. Reducing our toxicity load is one way to build our resilience ahead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-helped-to-open-up-about-mental-health/story-rlXk3G4Qpsef5oDYdrPx9K.html
15-06-2020||India||158 booked in Jharkhand lynching, mob violence||The police on Sunday lodged an FIR against eight identified and 150 unidentified people for allegedly being part of a mob that attacked and killed a murder accused and burnt four houses of his relatives in Giridih district’s Pipratand village, Jharkhand.The incident took place on June 13 when a mob of over 150, armed with traditional weapons, attacked the house of Suresh Marandi, reportedly a member of banned left wing extremist (LWE) group CPI-ML and absconding murder accused, and set it to fire.The mob took hold of Marandi while he was trying to escape. They also burnt three other houses of Marandi’s relatives who were also accused in the murder case. However, the police managed to rescue seven people. DSP Neeraj Kumar Singh, who was camping in the village, under Pirtand police station, said, “Heavy numbers of police force and CRPF personnel have been deployed in the region. The situation is completely under control now.” Ashok Prasad, officer in-charge of Pirtand police station, said, “An FIR has been registered in Marandi’s lynching case. Strict action will be taken.”He added that for the safety of Marandi’s family, they have been kept at the Bisunpur Panchayat Bhawan. “We are keeping a strict vigil on the movement of villagers to prevent any further attack on Marandi’s relatives residing in the village,” Prasad said. “Five accused allegedly involved in Kishku’s murder have been arrested and sent to jail.”An eerie silence prevailed in village even after 36 hours of the incident even as forces took out flag march in the village on Sunday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/158-booked-in-jharkhand-lynching-mob-violence/story-7rcpAEN50kTuz2U8IJkvZO.html
15-06-2020||India||Data takes centre stage in virus-ravaged world||The world, as we knew it until 2019, does not exist anymore. In the last six months, every aspect of our life has changed. And along with the international health crisis and economic disruption it has brought, the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has also taken over the conversations of our daily lives.Perhaps one of the most prominent changes it has brought is a newfound obsession with data where line graphs and histograms have replaced memes and other forwards in our WhatsApp conversations and Twitter feeds. People of all ages and from all professions now talk the language of data scientists, and everyone is mouthing terms such as reproductive rates, infection rate, mortality rate, doubling rate, flattening the curve, and exponential growth curve.We take a look at some of the most important data concepts that have become common conversation topics since the spread of the pandemic.Flattening of the curveIt is perhaps the most commonly used data term in conversations on the coronavirus disease and frequently mentioned in government briefings and media headlines and articles. It refers to measures that are meant to isolate people across a region in order to limit the daily or new infections of any disease to a level that can be handled by the local health care systems. The concept suggests slowing down the spread of the virus by introducing non-medical intervention measures like shutting down schools or introducing social distancing norms to ensure that fewer people need hospitalisation at any given point to time, and thus minimise the number of deaths. The curve referred to is the number of active cases (determined by subtracting the deaths and recovered patients from the total infections). This is then overlaid with the health care region’s capacity to show whether the health care system is overburdened (see chart above).One of the most widely accepted predictions based on this concept was prepared by a group of 30 epidemiologists from Imperial College in London, who ran simulation models to get an idea of what impact different forms of non-medical interventions would have on the spread of the disease. When they ran the model on the US and the UK, they found that the two countries were looking at around 2.2 million and half-a-million deaths, respectively, in the absence of any government intervention.One of the strategies studied by the model was mitigation, wherein people who are suspected to have been infected or exposed to Sars-CoV-2 would be quarantined. However, they saw that even then, hundreds of thousands of deaths were likely. So they suggested a more extreme strategy termed suppression, under which everyone would be required to remain socially distant, which they said would save millions of lives. This meant shutting down all spots of public interaction such as schools, universities, and markets and quarantine of anyone who tests positive, along with friends and families.Doubling rate The doubling rate is one of the Covid-19 data terms that has been introduced in the daily lexicon because it is so commonly used by the both the Central and state governments in daily media briefings. Loosely explained, it is the duration in which any number — for instance the fatality rate — doubles and is generally used to calculate exponential growth such as population rates, inflation and compound interest.Although a precise calculation is complex, an approximate doubling rate can be calculated by using the “rule of 72,” wherein you divide 72 by the growth percentage and the result is an estimated doubling rate in periods. In terms of the coronavirus pandemic, the doubling rate refers to the number of days it would take for any region to double its case or death count. So if there were 1,000 cases in a region on a particular day and the doubling rate at the time was five days, it would mean that the cases would touch 2,000 five days later (average daily increase of 14.9%).On March 25, when the lockdown started, the doubling time cases in India based on the previous week’s rate of new cases was 3.4 days. Since then, it has increased to 18.3 days on June 13.One shortcoming of comparing the doubling rates is that it may not truly reflect the volume of cases that are looming. For instance, when the doubling rate was 3.4 days on March 25 (see chart), we were adding around 150 cases a day. While the doubling rate is more than five times to 18.3 on June 13, the caseload now is now more than 320,000, which means that we are adding 12,500 cases every day. Comparing outbreaksTo account for the exponential nature of a pandemic in which cases multiply, instead of increasing in a linear manner, data analysts look at charts in a “logarithmic scale,” which makes changes in rates of case growth more prominent. This provides an avenue to compare rates of change between regions with vastly different caseloads.A key characteristic of the chart is that the Y-axis (vertical axis) is plotted in a logarithmic scale which enables us to display data over a very wide range in a compact way.In order to keep comparisons uniform, this chart takes Day 1 as the first day more than 500 cases were reported (see chart). Thus, we can compare countries going through advanced stages (such as the US) to countries that started reporting cases far later (India, Brazil) even though they may have a vast difference in the number of cases or deaths.Hammer and DanceThis analysis was made famous by Silicon Valley businessman Tomas Pueyo, who argued that the world needs to crackdown hard in a strategy that can be likened to a “hammer and dance” approach – with a first intense “hammer” move to stop the outbreak from growing followed by a sustained “dance” of lighter measures to contain the virus until a vaccine is found.The analysis, posted on blogging website Medium in March, takes into account several projections and infection trends that show how the spread of the disease can be interrupted by containment efforts such as social distancing. If governments fight hard at the start, they will curb deaths and relieve hospitals.During the Hammer phase, the goal is to get R number (the reproduction number) as close to zero, as fast as possible, he wrote. The idea is to fight the spread of the disease with the most intense of measures right when it starts spreading so once it moves to the Dance phase, restrictions can be removed and applied as needed in order to keep R number as close to 1 as possible, wrote Pueyo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/data-takes-centre-stage-in-virus-ravaged-world/story-nPrP9emFmakxMnVGytnkBK.html

Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal, who accompanied Pradhan to the disaster site and relief camps , said a model and a veterinary hospital, a higher secondary school and a skill development centre will be set up in Baghjan. “Today I announce that the Baghajan embankment will be constructed at a cost of ₹27 crore,” he said.“We will compensate all the affected people. Tea gardens, betel nut trees, fishes, houses and any other properties that have been damaged will be compensated in consultation with the Assam government,” Pradhan told people in a relief camp.After visiting the well site, the Union minister said the Centre and the state are trying for a permanent solution. “Oil India is an Assamese company. It has been working here for many decades. We will punish the culprit for this disaster even if he is a powerful man,” Pradhan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pradhan-promises-aid-to-assam-gas-blowout-victims/story-frbRS4uiKBEFNuEI77cVtK.html
15-06-2020||India||‘Radical change in Jammu-Kashmir over five years’: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said Jammu & Kashmir will witness a radical change in terms of development over the next five years and that people of Pakistan Occupied Kashmir (PoK) will be envious and will seek to live with India. “The day it happens, our unanimous resolution of Parliament will also be fulfilled,” he said at a virtual rally focussed on Jammu & Kashmir. Singh was referring to the February 1994 resolution that said the entire erstwhile state of Jammu & Kashmir, including PoK, are India’s integral part and asked Pakistan vacate the areas of the region it has occupied through aggression.Singh called Constitution’s Article 370, which was nullified last year , an “old stain”.Singh said the weather has changed and Pakistan is feeling the heat. “Our channels are now showing temperatures of Muzaffarabad and Gilgit [PoK]. ...Therefore, there is now more mischief but our security forces and agencies are giving them a befitting reply. Terrorists are being killed in large numbers...”In its response, the Pakistan Foreign Office rejected Singh’s remarks about the situation in J&K, while it described the Article 370 move as “illegal and unilateral” and said subsequent steps showed “that the primary motivation remains the disempowerment and disenfranchisement of the Kashmiri people…”Pakistan alleged that Singh’s statements were a “desperate attempt” to divert attention and accused India of “human rights violations”.Singh also questioned arch-rival Congress’s “discreet silence” over the nullification of Article 370. Congress spokesperson Jaiveer Shergill said, “At this juncture, defence minister rather than narrating poetry should explain the reality of 75% jump in Incursion by China at LAC and why till date China has not retreated from Pangong Tso.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/radical-change-in-jammu-kashmir-over-five-years-rajnath-singh/story-hkLfmPMxMlpYPvNmjV3dOL.html
15-06-2020||India||India no longer weak, will not compromise on pride: Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday said India and China want to resolve the stand-off between their border troops through dialogue even as he underlined that his government will never compromise when it comes to national pride. India is no longer a weak nation, he added. “Many people including the opposition have raised questions. From time to time, information is being given to the people... military-level talks are on to resolve the dispute,” he said at a virtual rally focussed on Jammu & Kashmir. “China wants resolution via talks and India also wants to resolve this tussle through diplomatic and military talks.”Singh said his government would divulge everything at an appropriate time. “For now, I can say with confidence and conviction that we can never make any compromise with our national pride. India is not a weak nation anymore. Our power has increased manifold,” said Singh, who was on Friday briefed about the standoff and the status of the military-level dialogue.Singh’s comments came a day after army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane said disengagement of Indian and Chinese forces is taking place in a “phased manner” along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the situation there is “under control”. The disengagement comes even as India and China continue diplomatic and military engagements for a resolution of the stand-off.Indian and Chinese army delegations met on Friday for the fifth time in eastern Ladakh for talks to resolve the stand-off that began with a violent confrontation between patrols of the two countries near Ladakh’s Pangong Tso on May 5. Another confrontation later followed in Sikkim. The confrontations triggered a military build-up on both sides of the LAC that stretched from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim, and Arunachal Pradesh.Singh said India is strengthening its forces to secure the country and not to scare anyone. He referred to US president Donald Trump’s invite this month to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to attend the G7 summit of seven major countries and called it an example of India’s growing popularity and power.He insisted India is in secure hands. “The BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party] government appointed the [country’s first] chief of defence staff [last year] without wasting any time. The issue of national security was hanging fire for the past 15 to 20 years,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-no-longer-weak-will-not-compromise-on-pride-rajnath-singh/story-P71CXuX1Akg7gU9ud32KPM.html
15-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||When will the coronavirus disease peak in India? That’s the Rs 20-lakh crore question.Some experts have said the disease is expected to peak in India in July. There’s a study funded by the Indian Council of Medical Research that is doing the rounds that expects the peak to happen in November.But I think we are asking the wrong question.Infections caused by the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease largely appear in concentrated clusters (at least, that’s been the trend everywhere in the world), which may make it pointless to try and answer the original question at the country-level for a nation as large as India. A better way of framing the question would be — when will the coronavirus disease peak in Delhi? Or Chennai? Or Mumbai? Or Ahmedabad? Or even Indore? Around the world, people have measured this simply by looking at the number of daily infections and deaths. At some stage — and this has happened in China’s Wuhan; Italy; Spain; even New York City — the numbers of daily cases and daily deaths start to decline consistently. It doesn’t just happen for a day or two but dips steadily and consistently over time.The bad news for Indian cities and states being ravaged by the coronavirus right now is that the trend line is still pointing north — not due north (that would be alarming), but north all the same. The numbers of new cases and deaths continue to rise, and, worryingly, so does the positivity rate, the proportion of those testing positive. And at least in these states and cities, no matter what anyone claims, there is clear community transmission (which actually isn’t that big a deal; many of the countries that have flattened the curve did see community transmission). Events over the weekend indicate that India is clearly stepping up its response to the pandemic but it would still help to know when the disease will peak across states and cities. At one level, this can help administrators plan ahead. At another, it gives everyone something to look forward to. An infection wanes under two conditions: it has run its course (which means enough of the population has been exposed to the pathogen and is, therefore, immune); or its chain has been broken either through a cure (or a vaccine), or by physically removing chances of an infection. For instance, across Europe, especially Western Europe, which was ravaged by the disease, the trend lines of daily cases all indicate a clear decline (even in the UK, which saw 1,425 new cases on June 13, well off its peak of 6,000-plus).Now, did this happen because the virus ran its course? Limited blood tests of the population in many of these countries do not indicate widespread immunity (it is accepted that 60-65% of the population will have to be infected to achieve what scientists call herd immunity). No country is close to that.Or did it happen simply because these countries managed to break the chain — by testing, tracing, isolating and treating the affected, and by persuading the rest of the population to take adequate precautions (masks, hand-washing, social distancing)? This appears more likely.In effect, the experience of most countries — let’s ignore smaller ones such as New Zealand that have crushed the curve (because they can) — shows that they haven’t worn the virus down; they have just managed to learn to live with it, minimising both infections and deaths as they wait for a possible cure.The 68-day lockdown in India may have deferred the peak, giving time for governments to strengthen their health care infrastructure but if the cases in India are continuing to rise rise (the country saw 12,081 new cases on Saturday, and 11,423 on Sunday), it’s because we have not done a good enough job of testing, tracing, and isolating the infected. And it’s because at least some of us have been lax in taking precautions. The country now seems to be stepping up its game on the first. People now have to step up theirs on the second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-znYKpjv5CkyR6uTPwxeJnL.html
15-06-2020||India||Capital to double tests in two days, treble them in six: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah held two separate meetings with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal on Sunday, announcing a series of steps, including aggressive testing and the formation of two committees, aimed at augmenting health care infrastructure , possibly capping treatment costs in private hospitals, and effective containment of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the national capital.Shah, who will hold an all-party meeting on Monday for further assessment of the pandemic situation in the Capital, also announced a comprehensive door-to-door survey in containment zones for contact tracing and promised the city 500 railway coaches having a capacity of 8,000 beds to treat Covid-19 patients to mitigate any possible shortage of beds.The meetings come amidst a wave of cases in the Capital. Delhi recorded 2,224 cases on Sunday, the third consecutive day it has seen more than 2,000 new infections. It ended Sunday with 41,182 infections (24,032 of them active) and 1,327 deaths. From Monday (June 8) to Sunday, the city has registered 12,246 cases. In the previous week (June 1-7), it recorded 9,092 cases. The number of containment zones in the city, meanwhile, rose from 147 on June 1 to 219 on Sunday.“To prevent the coronavirus infection in Delhi, testing will be doubled in the next two days, and after six days the testing will be increased to three times...Also, after a few days, testing will be started at every polling station in the containment zones,” Shah said in a series of tweets in Hindi after the first meeting. It was also attended by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, officials of the home and health ministries and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority.According to the Delhi government’s recent submission in the high court, the combined daily testing capacity of 40 labs — 17 public and 23 private — is 8,600 per day. However, from June 8-13 the city conducted just 5,525 tests per day. Delhi’s per million testing figure stands at 14,666, more than three times the national average of 4,245. An HT report published on June 6 said the regions where testing is significantly higher than the national average --- such as Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu -- are also the ones with significantly higher infections and deaths, especially when populations are factored in.Shah also asked private hospitals to earmark 60% of beds allotted for Covid-19 patients at a cheaper rate, a move that came against the backdrop of allegations that such health facilities were charging patients exorbitant fees. A key decision taken on Sunday was the formation of a committee under the chairmanship of Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul. It will give its report on Monday on ensuring reservation of the 60% beds and fix rates of testing and treatment.Based on decisions taken at the meeting , the Union ministry of health announced in the evening that it has set up three teams of four doctors each to inspect all major dedicated Covid-19 facilities in the state and suggest improvements. And All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) announced the creation of a 24x7 helpline in Hindi and English (9115444155), using which callers can avail out-patient appointments or talk to volunteers. The helpline is also open to doctors who will be connected to consultants. A focal point of Delhi’s Covid-19 strategy has been health care infrastructure. With Kejriwal fearing that the state might need 150,000 beds by the end of July, his government has zeroed in on 77 banquet halls and 40 hotels to add nearly 16,000 beds to the existing capacity of 9,698 beds across government and private hospitals in the city. Another side of the debate that has come to the fore is the quality of health services. Two days ago, the Supreme Court termed the condition of Delhi’s Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital as “pathetic” and its wards as “deplorable”, though the government said it was trying its best to provide quality services.Amidst a flurry of activities on Sunday, the Centre also transferred four senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers --- Awanish Kumar and Monica Priyadarshini from Andaman and Nicobar Islands, and Gaurav Singh Rajawat and Vikram Singh Mallik from Arunachal Pradesh --- to help the city-state manage the Covid-19 situation. The government also directed the attachment of two senior IAS officers – SCL Das and SS Yadav -- from the Centre to Delhi.After the morning meeting, Shah announced that the Centre promised to provide the Delhi government with necessary resources such as oxygen cylinders, ventilators and pulse oximeters, among others. He also said the Centre will issue fresh guidelines on the last rites for Covid-19 victims with an aim to reduce the waiting time for cremations. Later in the day, the health ministry followed up and said bodies of all those suspected to have died of Covid-19 would be “handed over to relatives immediately” without waiting for confirmation. The bodies would be “disposed with precautions,” it added. For efficient monitoring in containment zones, every individual will be asked to download the Aarogya Setu app, Shah said.People familiar with the developments said Kejriwal agreed to all steps proposed by Shah during the one-and-a-half-hour meeting in the morning. “Extremely productive meeting between Delhi government and Central government. Many key decisions taken. We will fight corona together,” Kejriwal tweeted after the meeting.An Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government spokesperson said: “The meeting between the central government and Delhi government was very productive. All issues related to Delhi’s fight against Covid-19 were discussed in detail and key decisions were jointly taken. The central government and the Delhi government agreed on an immediate action plan to increase capacity of beds, increase testing and other important initiatives. This pandemic is among the worst to have happened in the history of mankind and it is imperative for all of us to come together to fight this pandemic.”In the second meeting in the afternoon, the mayors of Delhi’s three municipal corporations were present alongside Shah, Kejriwal, Vardhan, and All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria.“We have to turn the country and the national capital Corona free, healthy and prosperous at the earliest under the leadership of the Prime Minister Narendra Modi,” Shah said, according to a press statement by the Centre. “This will be possible with the cooperation and coordination of all concerned,” he added. Shah also asked the Delhi government and all concerned departments to ensure proper implementation of the decisions.At the meeting, the three civic bodies offered to give their community centres, hospitals and schools to the Delhi government for use. “We have extended full support and cooperation to the Delhi government in fight this pandemic. There are other hospitals and our staff is working hard to provide best possible care,” North corporation mayor Avtar Singh said. The three civic bodies are governed by the BJP. In a related development, a statement from the home minister’s office said Shah called an all-party meeting to review the Covid-19 health crisis in the national capital. The meeting will take place at North Block at 11am on Monday. The Congress, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the AAP and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) have been asked to be present alongside top state and central officials.When asked about the all-party meeting, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said he will raise issues related to Covid-19 testing. “There is a need to increase testing to contain the disease. We also need to upgrade our facility so that people can be under medical supervision,” he said.Commenting on the decisions taken on Sunday, Dr Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine, Safdarjung Hospital, said door-to-door survey was the most effective way of identifying cases early. “However, people going door-to-door need to be adequately trained in interacting with common people as community participation is a must during outbreak situations for effective implementation of containment strategies. Half the battle is won if you win the faith of people,” he said.(with inputs from Risha Chitlangia in Delhi)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/capital-to-double-tests-in-two-days-treble-them-in-six-shah/story-OhI6vA7ArxrbauYJg5ItWP.html
15-06-2020||India||13% more sowing points to a bumper kharif crop||Farmers have planted kharif or summer-sown crops, which account for half of India’s annual food output, on 9.3 million hectares – 13.2% higher than last year’s level for this time of the year – in an indication that the agriculture sector has largely escaped the impact of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak so far.The area sown is a critical gauge of the progress of cultivation, which depends on availability of inputs, such as fertilisers, seeds and pesticides, apart from weather. A larger sown area, aided by good weather, is an early sign of ample harvests.Timely onset and a steady advance of the monsoon have resulted in increasing summer acreage. A good south-west monsoon is critical because nearly 60% of India’s summer-sown area is dependent on rains because of lack of irrigation and the farm sector employs nearly half of the country’s workforce.Latest data from the agriculture ministry showed that farmers have sown pulses in 0.2 million hectares on June 13, 44.3% higher than sowing completed during the corresponding period last year. The acreage under oilseeds stood at 0.4 million hectares. Among cereals, sowing of the main summer staple, rice, was higher by 15.5% at 0.6 million hectares. Coarse cereals saw a 41.2% spike in sowing compared to the corresponding period last year.The areas under cash crops have also seen increases. The area under cotton is up 23.4% at 1.9 million hectare currently. Farmers have also sown sugarcane on 4.8 million hectares, which is 1.3% higher than last year.The monsoon so far has been surplus by 31%, India Meteorological Department’s data till June 14 shows. The rain-bearing system has pushed into central Arabian sea, some parts of north-east Arabian sea, Gujarat, Dadra & Nagar Haveli, Maharashtra, including Mumbai, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and partially into Bihar and Madhya Pradesh, progressing robustly, according to an IMD bulletin on Sunday. A normal monsoon will lessen the strain on the agriculture economy from widespread disruptions caused by the Covid-19 pandemic, analysts say.Plentiful harvests are key to rural incomes and keeping the lid on inflation. Agricultural incomes push up rural demand for goods and services in the larger economy; this keeps the manufacturing going. For instance, in a good crop year, nearly half of all motorcycles are sold in rural areas, according to Citibank Research.Agriculture has so far escaped the impact of the pandemic, largely due to sufficient rains and uninterrupted markets for seeds and fertilisers, which were exempt from the lockdown. The farm sector is poised to grow at least 3% in 2020-21, despite the pandemic, according to the state-run think tank Niti Aayog’s assessment in April. There are other indicators of an uptick, such as higher sales of fertilisers. According to data from the fertilisers ministry, fertiliser sales stood at 4 million tonne in May 2020, which is twice the total sale of about 2 million tonne during May 2019.“The monsoon has advanced well. Rainfall has been good. Moreover, it seems water availability has not been a problem anywhere, resulting in good acreages,” said RS Mani, an economist with the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-more-sowing-points-to-a-bumper-kharif-crop/story-n3hP6iFEnobnNbfLkEB95K.html
15-06-2020||India||Clear method for data collection must, says BN Srikrishna||India’s legal framework on personal data protection should ensure that the purpose for which data is collected is clearly explained and it should lay down a clear methodology for procuring data, retired Supreme Court justice BN Srikrishna said on Sunday.When data is collected without the consent of the individual, like in the current circumstances where a lot of data is being collected in connection with the Covid-19 pandemic, the law should ensure data anonymisation, he added“Under what circumstances can data be taken away without consent of the principal? Take for instance, the situation of Covid. Data is necessary for statistical probability. If someone wants to do research on impact of Covid, they will need a lot of data on it. This is where the aspect of “data anonymisation” comes in, where only numbers and no personal information can be utilized”, Srikrishna pointed out.He was speaking at a Webinar organized by law firm Shyam Padman Associates on the topic “The Challenges in Personal Data Protection in the absence of (a) Data Protection Law in India”.Srikrishna, who headed the committee which, in 2018, proposed the draft of the Personal Data Protection Bill said that the line between right to privacy of an individual and the right of the state to access data is a fine one and the data protection law should guarantee that data collected is only to the extent to which it is required.“The legislative enactment must categorically explain the purpose for the collection of data. There should be a rational connection (between the data collected and the purpose for which it is acquired). There should be no absurdity in the connection. There is also the need for proportionality. The law should not go beyond what is absolutely required”, he explained.The state, he said, can take away rights of an individual, only if it can ensure that it is for the greater good of the public.“For instance, in the case of Aarogya Setu, the state, in a positive move, did not make it mandatory”, Srikrishna said, referring to India’s contact tracing app. The central government came out with a draft Personal Data Protection (PDP) Bill in December 2019. The bill regulates personal data of individuals and governs the processing of such data by both government and companies incorporated in India.Justice Srikrishna said the bill falls short on certain aspects including absence of data localization which enables transfer of data outside India . “Can the State can access data of a person who is a suspect. The answer in the legislation is yes. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the PDP of 2019 has watered down this provision which allows the state to unilaterally infringe the fundamental right (of privacy) in the name of sovereignty and security”, he said while expressing hope that the Supreme Court will look into such aspects if the data protection law is challenged.The Supreme Court’s seminal 2017 judgment in the case of Justice KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India in which the court had held right to privacy as a facet of the fundamental right to life was instrumental in initiating debate on the absence of data protection laws in India.“The SC asked, ‘Where is the law on Data Protection?’ And everyone started looking at each other, with no clue about this. It is then the committee on the formulation of a Personal Data Protection Bill was founded”, Srikrishna said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clear-method-for-data-collection-must-bn-srikrishna/story-sIgkJwWdapfVdm8hdLllIN.html
15-06-2020||India||Wildlife board calls for study on impact of sand mining in Uttarakhand||The National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has raised concerns about extensive sand and boulder mining projects in Uttarakhand and their impact on river ecology and wildlife. As per the minutes of an NBWL meeting on June 11, it has recommended a study of the cumulative impact of the mining for consideration of future projects.There are over 100 sand mining leases operational in the state, according to its geology and mining department. NBWL had received three proposals for sand mining along the Asan Wetland Conservation Reserve and five along the Rajaji National Park’s boundary near Haridwar.NBWL considered the five proposals for the collection of sand, sand gravel (bajri) and boulders in the private lands located 1.5 to 9 km from the boundary thrice. But it decided against clearing the projects until they complied with Union environment ministry’s Sustainable Sand Mining Management Guidelines, 2016, and the National Tiger Conservation Authority’s conditions.“Few proposals may not have serious impact on ecology, ground water recharge and wildlife disturbance, but when several dozen miners work in the river beds around the Park, and hundreds may be thousands of trucks move every day for transport of the material, the anthropogenic pressure and ecological degradation would be serious,” said HS Singh, member NBWL, according to the minutes.The environment ministry’s Forest Advisory Committee has deferred the renewal of forest clearance for mining of minor minerals from 64 ha of forest land along river Song in Mussoorie forest division that Uttarakhand Forest Development Corporation had applied for. “The state government shall conduct a study to ascertain the impact of mining in upstream and downstream. The study shall come out with clear recommendations as how such mining is useful in maintaining the natural flow of the river and health of adjoining forests. It should cover the impact of mining in the area for last ten years. The study may correlate satellite imagery of last ten years,” FAC observed. It added the government should also quantify how much sand and boulder can be mined annually.According to the corporation, there are 10 leases that are being worked now, four on the Gaula river, the rest on Kosi, Dapka and Nandhaur, Sharda, Malan and Kotawali rivers. “Our permit for mining on Rawasan river expired in March. We have requested NBWL to grant us permission to mine on Rawasan for a few more months until we can renew the clearance. We also have forest clearances to mine sand on the Ganga and its other tributaries but we some court cases are pending against them,” said Monish Mullick, the Corporation’s managing director.Dinesh Kumar, deputy director, geology and mining, Uttarakhand, said they do not do any mechanised mining. “There are very few in wildlife dominated areas. We will not proceed on those without NBWL nod.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wildlife-board-calls-for-study-on-impact-of-sand-mining-in-u-khand/story-BZVSUqRi4wBOAzQtGgQBCL.html
15-06-2020||India||Congress seeks early end to Bihar alliance woes||Worried over the Janata Dal (United)-Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) combine having seized the first-mover advantage ahead of the assembly elections in Bihar, Congress leaders have urged the central leadership to chalk out a poll strategy to oust the ruling coalition from power in the state, according to people aware of the developments.While both the JD(U) and the BJP have kicked off their preparations for the assembly elections scheduled for October-November this year, the opposition Congress and the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) are yet to firm up their election plan. Senior BJP leader and Union home minister Amit Shah recently addressed a virtual rally to launch the party’s Bihar election strategy.The other smaller constituents of the mahagathbandhan or grand alliance, too, have demanded clarity on the issues of leadership and distribution of seats, a Congress functionary said on condition of anonymity.The RJD has sought to project Tejashwi Yadav as the chief ministerial candidate of the grand alliance, but Hindustani Awam Morcha (HAM) chief and former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi is against the move and has flagged lack of consultation in the opposition grouping.Rashtriya Lok Samata Party (RLSP) chief Upendra Kushwaha and Vikassheel Insaan Party (VIP) president Mukesh Sahani have demanded the formation of a coordination committee to sort out the differences in the mahagathbandhan. Kushwaha and Sahni made the demand after meeting twice last week.Bihar Congress leaders, too, want the party high command to initiate steps to spell out the future course of action vis-à-vis the alliance, letters written by regional leaders and reviewed by HT show.In their communications to the central leadership, state Congress leaders have expressed concern over the opposition having ceded its space in the midst of the coronavirus disease outbreak despite what they describe as the “failure” of the ruling coalition in containing the pandemic coupled with “massive anti-incumbency” against the government.They also pointed out to repeated jibes taken at Tejashwi Yadav by the ruling JD(U)-BJP leaders for his absence from the state after the outbreak of Covid-19.In his series of letters to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, senior party leader Kishore Kumar Jha urged him to hold a virtual rally and target the JD(U)-BJP combine for their handling of the migrant workers crisis.He also requested Gandhi to direct the state leaders to step out of the party’s Sadaqat Ashram headquarters in Patna and reach out to the masses across Bihar.The Congress has identified 60-70 of the total 243 seats where it is in a position to give a tough fight or even register a win against the ruling alliance, a senior leader overseeing party affairs said, asking not to be named.However, it remains to be seen if the RJD and other constituents are willing to agree to the Congress party’s demand for an increase in the number of seats over the ones it contested in the 2015 assembly elections.The Congress then contested on 41 seats and won 27. The JD(U), which was then a part of the grand alliance, and the RJD fought 101 seats each. While the RJD won 80 seats, the JD(U) won 71 and the BJP’s tally stood at 53.JD(U) leader and chief minister Nitish Kumar later exited the grand alliance and once again joined hands with the BJP to form a coalition government in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-seeks-early-end-to-bihar-alliance-woes/story-O9wznZToOtPCI3MNbR4EcO.html
15-06-2020||India||Extreme weather events in India on the rise||By the end of the 21st century, the number of warm days and warm nights in India is likely to be 55-70% higher compared to the average number between 1976 and 2005, according to the worst climate change scenario listed in the country’s first national climate change assessment by the ministry of earth sciences.And the frequency of summer heat waves is likely to be three to four times higher and their duration, likely to double .The report, to be released on Tuesday said that in the 29 years from 1986 to 2015, India has recorded several weather extremes --- such as an increase in warm days and nights and a rise in extremely severe cyclonic storms over the Arabian Sea --- that were a result of human-caused climate change. Rapid changes in India’s climate will put stress on ecosystems, agricultural output and freshwater resources, and also cause damage to infrastructure, the report, available on publishing platform Springer and seen by HT, added.“These portend serious consequences for the country’s biodiversity, food, water and energy security, and public health…higher temperatures, extreme weather events, and higher climate variability have been associated with an elevated risk of heat strokes, cardiovascular and neurological diseases, and stress-related disorders,” the report said. Under all climate change scenarios, the extremes will only intensify. For example, temperatures of the warmest day and the coldest night of the year increased by 0.63 degree Celsius and 0.4 degree Celsius, respectively, in the 29-year period.“India has witnessed a rise in average temperature; a decrease in monsoon precipitation; a rise in extreme temperature and rainfall events, droughts, and sea levels; and an increase in the intensity of severe cyclones, alongside other changes in the monsoon system. There is compelling scientific evidence that human activities have influenced these changes in regional climate,” the report, drafted by scientists from Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology said.The number of warm days have increased by about 9.9 per decade and warm nights by 7.7 per decade, the report said. Cold nights have decreased by 3.3 per decade during this period. Warm days or nights are those when maximum and minimum temperatures are over the 90th percentile.“Heat action plans need to be further developed and calibrated. We need to track what kind of changes in health impacts we are seeing…In the long term, our infrastructure needs to be heat-resistant or mortality will increase; cool roofs, efficient cooling should be a part of policy,” said Dr Dileep Mavalankar, director, Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar, Gujarat.India’s average temperature has risen by around 0.7 degree Celsius during 1901–2018, which may not reflect these extremes. The largest increase in the annual mean temperature of more than 0.2 degree Celsius per decade was observed in some areas of north India between 1986 and 2015. The warming is much weaker in the southern peninsula.With increase in air temperature, sea surface temperature over the Indian Ocean has already risen abnormally by 1 degree Celsius in the 64 years between 1951 and 2015 compared to the global average sea surface warming of 0.7 degree Celsius. The frequency of extremely severe cyclonic storms (ESCS) over the Arabian Sea has increased during the post-monsoon seasons of 1998–2018. Most models are projecting a higher sea surface warming in the Arabian Sea than the Bay of Bengal. Oxygen concentrations and marine phytoplankton have declined in the recent decades.“It’s a first for India. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change produces such reports for global impact assessment. This national report can help policymakers in different sectors specially health and agriculture. We plan to do this review every four to five years,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, the ministry of earth sciences.The report has also underlined that climate change has already skewed the monsoon patterns with rains decreasing by 6% between 1951 and 2015. The Indo-Gangetic Plains and Western Ghats have recorded the highest declines, but the frequency of extreme rainfall (over 150 mm) has increased by 75% between 1950 and 2015 in central India. There is a shift towards more frequent dry spells (27% higher than the 1951-1980 period) and more intense wet spells during the summer monsoon season. High elevations of the Tibetan Plateau recorded severe warming as high as 0.5 degree Celsius per decade, according to the report.The projections in the assessment report are based on the climate models used in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and climate change modeling studies using the IITM Earth System Model (ESM) and CORDEX South Asia datasets.The report has warned of a cascade of climate-related hazards, which will overlap. For instance, a region may experience an abnormally long or intense summer heat wave followed by intense monsoon floods that alternate with lengthening dry spells.“Low-lying coastal zones, especially on India’s east coast, may witness rising sea levels damaging property and increasing groundwater salinity. A rise in cyclone intensities will likely result in increasing inundation from the accompanying storm surges that turn proximate agricultural lands and lakes saline, and imperil wildlife,” the report added.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) released on Sunday a detailed report on Super Cyclone Amphan, which devastated parts of Sunderbans after it made landfall on May 20. The IMD report said tidal waves as high as 15 feet or around 5 metres inundated low-lying areas of the islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/extreme-weather-events-on-the-rise/story-6fUAeJnnibsb0ExziRk5BK.html
15-06-2020||India||8 week lockdown led to India pushing coronavirus peak to November: Study||The eight-week lockdown in India shifts the peak of the epidemic by 34-76 days and reduces the number of cases at the end of the lockdown by 69-97% , a new pre-print study by academics at the Department of Community Medicine and School of Public health at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research and Education and Research, Chandigarh, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, ICMR, New Delhi claimed. India imposed a lockdown that was nearly 10 weeks long and some of the restrictions are still in place (although many have been eased). The study, which is yet to be peer reviewed also claimed that “intensification of public health surveillance measures with 60% effectiveness” would reduce the number of cases at the peak by 70% and cumulatively by 26.6%. Such measures would also reduce the requirement for ICU beds and ventilators by 83%, the study added. Interestingly, the study puts the cost of managing Covid-19 at India at 4.5% of GDP in the absence of any “intervention” and 6.2% with “intensified public health measures.” The study was based on a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Recovered (or SERI) model. Worryingly, the study said that India’s health care infrastructure may prove inadequate later this year with the demand for isolation and ICU beds and ventilators exceeding supply in November even with “intensified public health measures with 60% effectiveness.” The study was funded by ICMR. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-delayed-covid-peak-study/story-uPZZuCOJoI3K87FAKZ1bxM.html
15-06-2020||India||Plan to reimburse data usage in work-from-home hits hurdle||The Union finance ministry’s expenditure department has for now opposed a proposal for Rs 300 monthly reimbursement for increased data usage for officials working from home, saying it is unnecessary since remote working saves the travelling costs, officials aware of the matter said.The proposal has been made as part of deliberations for the formulation of the Centre’s work from home policy. The policy is being drafted in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic that has prompted social distancing norms and remote working globally to check its spread.An official in ministry of personnel, public grievances and pensions familiar with the developments, said the the Department felt the proposed reimbursement “unnecessary” in its feedback last week. “The feeling is that since officials have to bear less travel costs, data usage reimbursement is not necessary at this point,” said one of the officials on condition of anonymity.An expenditure department official, who did not wish to be named, said there is no question of such reimbursement as officials are paid for travel and other costs. The official added that the no formal proposal has been made as yet, although officials from other departments confirmed that it has been debated. The department of administrative reforms and public grievances (DARPG), which is drafting the work from home guidelines, has held at least 35 meetings with representatives of over 80 ministries and departments over the last month to seek their feedback. The proposal for the monthly compensation for data usage has been discussed at the meetings.Extending virtual private network (VPN) access to officers below the secretary level, creation of a cloud large enough to store all the information, and providing support like laptops are among other suggestions DAPG has received apart from the one for the data usage reimbursement. Officers above the rank of deputy secretary were allowed VPN access in 2019.A VPN works usually through the internet and connects remote users to an organisation’s network.A third official said they have sought VPN access for nearly 20,000 officials. “At present, nearly 3,000 officials have the access,” the official said on condition of anonymity.The Union electronics, information and technology ministry has also recommended that eOffice, the fulcrum of the government’s functioning during the Covid-19 lockdown, be used for routine files for now.“Bulk procurement of laptops is also being debated,” said the second official from the personnel, pensions and grievances ministry. “Another key aspect is access to sensitive files [for] which the ministry of home affairs is yet to take a call on.”The above-mentioned DAPRG official said a work from home policy was definitely on the cards but the only question remains whether it will be a liberal or a slightly restricted one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plan-to-reimburse-data-usage-in-work-from-home-hits-hurdle/story-wA1J94wbT1YSkBJi5PQ6AP.html
15-06-2020||India||Indore cop, SDM who knelt down to talk to Congress MLAs shunted out||The Madhya Pradesh government late Saturday night transferred a sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) and a city superintendent of police (CSP) from Indore hours to Bhopal after they knelt down to talk to Congress MLAs including a former minister to talk to and persuade them to withdraw their agitation.A photo of the SDM Rakesh Sharma and CSP DK Tiwari talking to Congress MLA and ex-minister Jitu Patwari while the latter along with another Congress MLA Sanjay Shukla and two other Congress leaders was staging a sit-in at Rajwada went viral on social media prompting the ruling party leaders in Indore to question the conduct of the officers and demanding action against them.The Congress MLAs were demanding lodging of an FIR against ex-MLA from BJP Sudarshan Gupta for his organising a programme without the district administration’s permission to celebrate Union minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s birthday on Friday.A huge crowd turned up to receive food grains from Gupta at the programme as the latter had announced leading to a chaotic situation and social distancing norms thrown to the wind. There was even loot of food grains packets by a number of people.District collector, Indore Manish Singh served a notice to Sharma as to ‘why a disciplinary action be not taken against him for compromising with dignity of a magistrate’. However, within hours of the notice Sharma was transferred from Indore to the state secretariat ‘with immediate effect on administrative ground’. The CSP DK Tiwari too was transferred from Indore to police headquarters at Bhopal ‘with immediate effect’, as per the show cause notice and the transfer orders.State Congress leader KK Mishra said, “The BJP government exposed its parochial view by transferring the officers. This is a politically motivated decision causing injustice to officers who were discharging their duties by persuading public representatives to withdraw their agitation.”State Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “Congress was in power for 15 months since December 2018 but it never showed any political bias. Those who were staging the sit-in are public representatives. Did the officers commit any mistake by showing respect to public representatives?”Chief secretary Iqbal Singh Bains and director general of police (DGP) Vivek Johri could not be reached for their comments. They did not take phone calls and did not respond to text messages.State BJP spokesperson Rajneesh Agrawal brushed aside the Congress’ objections. “The government is empowered to take decisions on transfers of officers on administrative grounds. It will be better if the Congress focuses on real issues concerning people,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indore-top-cop-sdm-who-knelt-down-to-talk-to-congress-mlas-shunted-out/story-3OeMSiKWwiwRtj1oKBV08M.html
