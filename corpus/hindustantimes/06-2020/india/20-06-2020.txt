The MLA had also attended the BJP legislature party meetings on Wednesday and Thursday.The MLA happens to be the second legislator in the state to be infected with Covid-19. Earlier, a Congress MLA tested positive for the virus. He turned up in a personal protective equipment (PPE) kit in the state assembly on Friday afternoon to cast his vote. He, however, had been given the facility of a postal ballot that he didn’t go for, according to legislators.The state Congress has accused the BJP MLA of putting in peril the life of other legislators including chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan who chaired the BJP legislature party meetings and also cast his vote in RS polls, state assembly secretariat staff and the selected media people who were allowed to cover the Rajya Sabha polls amid the Covid-19 situation.State Congress spokesperson Ajay Yadav said, “We have learnt that the BJP MLA got samples of his wife and himself tested for coronavirus two days back but still he attended the BJP legislature party meetings. He has committed a grave offence by concealing the information about his health and he should be immediately booked.”The MLA confirmed that he and his wife had tested positive for Covid-19. However, he said, they went for the test on Friday only. “When my wife complained about fever we got our samples tested on Friday. Now we are going to be hospitalised,” the MLA said over phone.State BJP spokesperson and MLA Rameshwar Sharma said, “I can’t comment on whether the MLA knew about his health conditions but we are alert about our health and consulting doctors as to what to do. However, certain MLAs have gone to hospitals too for their test today. Another concern is many MLAs who came from other districts to Bhopal to cast their votes have returned to their homes. If any of these MLAs test positive for coronavirus, his family members too will be prone to contracting the disease and so will the others who are in contact with him.”State assembly principal secretary and returning officer for Rajya Sabha election AP Singh said, “We all followed all required safety measures including social distancing norms and the state assembly premises was sanitised on Friday. But it’s a matter of concern if the MLA removed his face mask to talk to others or some legislators and others might have come close to him.”As many as 206 MLAs cast their votes on Friday during the Rajya Sabha polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-rs-polls-bjp-mla-wife-test-covid-ve-in-mp/story-YQ7IhvXB9gOZ3VvFa3PUwI.html

20-06-2020||India||Puri King asks Naveen Patnaik to move SC to modify order stopping Rath Yatra||Two days after the Supreme Court stayed the Rath Yatra in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Gajapati Dibyasingh Deb, the titular king of Puri, requested chief minister Naveen Patnaik to approach top court for modification of the order to permit the Rath Yatra only at Puri.On Thursday, a three-judge bench, headed by chief justice SA Bobde had stayed the Rath Yatra scheduled for June 23, saying as 10-12 lakh people may congregate in Puri for the Rath Yatra, it would be appropriate in the interests of public health and safety of citizens to restrain the government from holding the Rath Yatra. Later in the evening, the state cabinet headed by the CM decided to abide by the SC order.The SC judgement caused a massive outrage in Odisha with at least four intervention petitions including one by Chhatisa Nijoga, the apex body of priests of the Jagannath temple filing two intervention petitions in the matter seeking recall of the order and allowing Rath Yatra at Puri by adhering to the government’s guidelines on Covid-19. On Saturday, several priests staged protests in front of the Jagannath temple in Puri demanding that the festival be held as scheduled. The Puri king, who heads the management of the 12th century Jagannath temple, is considered the first servitor of the deities, had initially said he concurred with the state cabinet decision on not holding Rath Yatra. But after attending meeting of Chhatisa Nijog, he said that festival has not been stopped even in the midst of the worst natural disasters and epidemics“The present crisis caused by Covid pandemic, is not a situation which renders it impossible to conduct Ratha Yatra in Puri as it can be held without any congregation of the general public. If Ratha Yatra is not held this year in Puri, it will hurt the religious sentiments of countless devotees around the world who watch the sacred Yatra live every year on electronic media. I request you to take appropriate steps for approaching the Supreme Court for a partial modification of its June 18 so as to permit performance of Ratha Yatra only at Puri,” wrote Divyasingh Deb in his letter to Patnaik.The Puri king said that Lord Jagannatha is the Lord of the Universe and during this sacred festival he comes out of the temple and rides the chariot so that everyone can obtain his grace. “It is an established tradition of Sanatana Vaidika Dharma that the presiding deities do not at all leave their sanctum sanctorum. But Lord Jagannath himself created an exception to this general rule by coming out of the temple to bless all beings in the whole universe. This is one of the main objectives of the Ratha Yatra as mentioned in the sacred scriptures.” He further said that managing committee of the temple is statutorily bound to ensure conduct of Ratha Yatra in accordance with the Record-of-Rights and Ratha Yatra in Puri should not be stopped, even if Ratha Yatra and other religious functions are not permitted elsewhere under Covid-19 restrictions. Citing a 1964 order of SC he said the Rath Yatra of Puri is unique which “requires special treatment” by the state government.Meanwhile, Chhastisa Nijog, the apex body of the priests of the temple has moved two intervention petitions seeking recall of the June 18 order of the SC. Janardhan Pattajoshi Mohapatra, chief servitor of Lord Jagannath in his petition said that the Rath Yatra has an unbroken tradition and is an essential practice of the Jagannath temple.Three more intervention applications have been filed to allow the conduct of the Rath Yatra. While Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Mancha sought a recall of the Supreme Court order another intervention application seeking a partial modification of the SC order was filed by one Aftab Hossen, which argued that crores of rupees have been spent in construction of the chariots and Covid-19 tests of hundreds of servitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puri-king-asks-naveen-patnaik-to-move-sc-to-modify-order-stopping-rath-yatra/story-2JwaYKmSHuyd68sQS5fCHP.html
20-06-2020||India||‘No restrictions on using firearms’: India gives soldiers freedom along LAC in extraordinary times||A significant change in Rules of Engagement (ROE) by the Indian Army following the Galwan Valley skirmish that left 20 Indian soldiers dead gives “complete freedom of action” to commanders deployed along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) to “handle situations at the tactical level,” two senior officers said on Saturday on condition of anonymity.The commanders will no longer be bound by restrictions on the use of firearms and will have full authority to respond to “extraordinary situations” using all resources at their disposal, said one of the officers cited above.The amendment in ROE comes after Indian and Chinese soldiers engaged in their first deadly conflict in 45 years in Galwan Valley on June 15, resulting in death of 20 Indian army troops and several Chinese casualties.Also read: Released after 60 hours by China, 10 Indian soldiers undergo debriefingIn his remarks during an all-party meeting on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the army had been given the freedom to take necessary steps along the border and India had conveyed its position (to China) through diplomatic means.“With the changes in the ROE, there’s nothing that limits the ability of Indian commanders to take whatever action they deem necessary on the LAC. ROE have been amended to address the brutal tactics being employed by Chinese troops,” said the second officer cited above.The seven-hour Galwan Valley clash marked the first time India suffered combat fatalities in an incident involving Chinese troops since 1975. Changes in ROE were imminent after a series of violent clashes along the border, with the army finally deciding not to restrict the scope of response of its soldiers after the June 15 clash, the second officer said.“Two violent clashes took place in Pangong Tso (May 5-6) and Galwan Valley (around mid-May) before the June 15 skirmish in eastern Ladakh. On all occasions, they came in huge numbers and assaulted our troops with iron roads and nail-studded clubs. Our troops fought back fearlessly but the ROE had to be revisited,” he said.Also read: India tells China to stick to its side, says no soldier missingForward troops keep their guns slung on their backs with the magazines in pouches and not clipped on.“Since soldiers are allowed to carry weapons while patrolling the LAC, it is inherent that they can use the firearms in unprecedented situations like the attack in Galwan Valley,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).The government said on Thursday that soldiers involved in the June 15 clash with Chinese troops were carrying weapons and ammunition but did not open fire as they were following border agreements between the two countries -- a remark that came in response to a question from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on whether the Indian soldiers were sent in “unarmed”.“Let us get the facts straight. All troops on border duty always carry arms, especially when leaving post. Those at Galwan on 15 June did so. Long-standing practice (as per 1996 & 2005 agreements) not to use firearms during faceoffs,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted, responding to a post by Gandhi earlier this week.Border agreements from 1996 and 2005 between India and China disallow the use of firearms during face-offs. Article 6 of the agreement on confidence-building measures in the military field along the LAC, signed by India and China in November 1996, states that both sides will not open fire or “conduct blast operations or hunt with guns or explosives within two kilometers from the Line of Actual Control”.Top retired commanders and China watchers, however, said that Galwan clash and last month’s Pangong Tso brawl were not classical face-offs between rival troops but were extremely violent attacks on Indian soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-restrictions-on-firearms-india-gives-soldiers-freedom-along-lac-in-extraordinary-times/story-pCcFAcSAkMRschq50Tom1L.html

20-06-2020||India||Govt to form rules for movement of vehicles between India and its neighbours||The Centre on Saturday proposed to issue guidelines for facilitating movement of passengers and good vehicles with neighbouring countries and amend existing motor vehicle rules.A draft notification of the new guidelines was issued Saturday by the ministry of road transport and highways inviting suggestions from all, including the general public. Hindustan Times has reviewed a copy of the draft.The proposed rules will be called the Central Motor Vehicles (Regulation of Bus Service between India and Neighbouring countries of India (Movement of Vehicles Carrying Goods and Passengers) Rules, 2020.According to the draft rules, the transport department, government of any states of India (as mentioned in MoU) will be responsible for the conduct of the bus service and will perform various other duties assigned to them.It will be the duty of state police to provide security to the bus service. A DIG rank police office shall be assigned such responsibilities. The Intelligence Bureau (IB) will be the nodal intelligence agency coordinating the intelligence related issues for smooth conduct of bus service.The bus service will be running for as many days (as mentioned in MoU) and frequency will be reviewed by the state transport department. “The bus service shall follow the designated routes as mentioned in MoU and the state transport department will decide the halting place for the buses. The state transport department will take care of formalities like provisioning of tickets, debugging of bus, roadworthiness of the bus, frisking/checking of passengers, handling of luggage, etc, before departure from the designated place. The various agencies shall perform responsibilities assigned to them at ICP (integrated check post) of India,” the draft rules state.The proposed rules also say that the drivers shall carry a regular permit for transport vehicle valid for one year and renewable upto a maximum period of five years on a yearly basis. In addition to the registration number assigned to a transport vehicle operating under the agreement by the competent authority, the following particulars shall be painted in English and in official language of the respective country [each letter being not less than two inches (five centimeters) high and two inches (five centimeters) wide, legibly painted on a plain plate or plates affixed to the vehicles], including i) Place of India - Place of India Neighbouring Country - Place of India (on front side and back side of such transport vehicle in a conspicuous place) and the name of the operator of the bus service (on both the sides of such transport vehicle).This ministry said it had been receiving requests from various government departments and states regarding supporting rules required under the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for the facilitation of movement of vehicles carrying goods and passengers between Indian states and other neighbouring countries from time to time.To be clear, India presently does not have central guidelines for facilitating movement with neighbouring countries. According to a ministry official, these will be the first standard guidelines to streamline movement with neighbouring countries.The ministry has at present notified rules for the facilitation of bus service between Amritsar and Lahore (2006), between New Delhi and Lahore (2000), between Calcutta and Dhaka (2000) and Amritsar and Nankana Sahib (2006).All such regulations have been finalised to facilitate operations under MOUs which have been signed between India and other neighbouring countries. In 2018, India also notified rules regarding movement of Bangladesh registered LPG trucks in Indian territory for supply of bulk LPG to the LPG Bottling Plant at Bishalgarh in Tripura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-form-rules-for-movement-of-vehicles-between-india-and-its-neighbours/story-hki80CGPDKfyrRAaU7jggN.html

20-06-2020||India||‘Celebrating Father’s Day in Lucknow after a decade…’||After shifting his base to his ‘karmabhoomi,’ Mumbai in 2009-10, this will be ‘Bulleya’ singer Amit Mishra first Father’s Day celebration in his hometown after over a decade.“After years this is probably for the first time that I will be with him on this special day in Lucknow. Once, we were together but that was in Mumbai so we had a small celebration as I had a meeting there but this time it’s going to be very special as we are together and spending quality time at our home,” said the singer.Talking about his bonding with his father Devendra Prasad Mishra and mother Geeta, he says, “When I left Lucknow, I was mamma’s boy and now after this lockdown I’m papa’s boy…so it’s pretty balanced now.”After Mother’s Day celebrations last month, he now has plans for this occasion as well. “There are some surprises which of course are gifts. I will help my mother cook some Indian cuisine which he likes. I will try to take the family to this ancient Bhuddhesharan Temple if it’s open. In evening, the family will connect on video call with sister (Sushma), my Tayaji and Chachaji as we are a big family unit.”Talking about his father’s music inclination, Amit shares, “He rarely sings but is very fond of music. He is fun loving and we tease him a lot as his favorite performer till date is yesteryear’s actor Helen. ‘Bahut moody hai woh.’ On the same time, he is very rooted and disciplined. My mother is fan of Kishor (Kumar) and Mohd Rafi while father is enjoys songs of Mukesh and Mahendra Kapoor. We had large collection of cassettes which probably gave a base to my musical interest.”Amit now plans to make Lucknow his base, “Mumbai has been my ‘karambhoomi’ and will remain so. But during this lockdown and staying with my parents I have realised what I was missing. Now, I will be frequently traveling to Mumbai but will be based in Lucknow and will try to spend at least 7-8 days with family every month. ‘Mujhen yeah rishte kismet se wapas mile hai isey main khona nahi chahta’ (I have got it back all relations by luck and I don’t want to lose it further). Now, I understand how much they missed me and I missed them…that way this has been the best realisation during this lockdown!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/celebrating-father-s-day-in-lucknow-after-a-decade/story-XjI4blyWu72xO40ZuCkbOK.html
20-06-2020||India||Goa will now discharge asymptomatic patients without negative test||The Goa government will follow the discharge protocol as recommended by the Union Health Ministry and cease its practice of compulsorily testing each Covid-19 patient twice before release, the state’s Health Secretary Nila Mohanan said on Saturday. According to the Union Health Ministry’s guidelines, asymptomatic patients or those who have tested positive but displayed no symptoms can be discharged within ten days if they do not show any symptoms during the period. Symptomatic patients are, however, to be tested before the treating doctor decides the patient is cured and can be discharged. “In Goa we were testing all patients twice as we, like many other states, had chosen to continue with the earlier protocol of two consecutive negative tests before discharge. The Supreme Court has, however, ordered that the same protocol be followed across the country and we are bound by that,” Mohanan said at a press conference.“Asymptomatic patients will be discharged without a test in 10 days if they do not display any symptoms and be asked to maintain home quarantine. Symptomatic patients will be discharged with a single negative test,” she said.Covid-19 cases in Goa have soared in Goa since the beginning of June and its tally now stands at 754 cases of which 625 are active. Almost 95% of the patients are asymptomatic but are awaiting two consecutive negative tests in order that they can be discharged, as is the current protocol. Twenty nine fresh cases were detected on Saturday. A large chunk -- 505 of the 754 -- cases in Goa are either from or linked to Goa’s first containment zone that was notified earlier this month at Mangor Hill in the port town of Vasco da Gama. Since then Goa has three more containment zones where smaller areas have been cordoned off on account of clusters of cases being found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-will-now-discharge-asymptomatic-patients-without-negative-test/story-S7KG8cEVbc39jFRvsDnPTP.html

At least, 5,391 coronavirus patients have been cured and sent home till date. Among the total number of active cases in the state, at least 74 are admitted in the intensive care unit and need critical care for respiratory complaints.ALSO READ | Contact tracing still a crucial tool to curb spread of coronavirus, say expertsA 56-year-old head constable of the city police, who had tested positive for the coronavirus infection a couple of days ago and was undergoing treatment died on Saturday, the police said.The policeman attached to the Kalasipalya police station, was being treated at Victoria Hospital. This is the second death of a policeman in Karnataka due to Covid-19. The first one was an assistant sub-inspector attached to the V V Puram traffic police station.Police officials said the constable was among nine others who had recently tested positive for Covid-19. An ASI with the Wilson Garden traffic police station in Bengaluru has also reportedly tested positive for the infectious disease. The ASI is undergoing treatment at a designated hospital and the police station has been sanitised. His contacts too are being quarantined.Earlier this week, the Union health ministry appreciated Karnataka’s methods for Covid-19 management, which includes comprehensive contact tracing of Covid-19 positive cases and physical or phone-based survey that has covered more than 1.5 crore households in the state.The Karnataka government has over a period of time effectively traced and tracked each positive case and their contacts, hence successfully containing the spread of the infectious disease, the ministry said. Karnataka has one of the lowest coronavirus case counts in the country, compared to neighbouring Tamil Nadu, which with over 50,000 cases is now at second spot and among the worst-hit states by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-records-416-new-covid-19-cases-a-head-constable-succumbs-to-infection/story-4SI06bRbqyTx7TeUb0v6qI.html
20-06-2020||India||Ladakh vs Doklam standoff: Same military commander, different tactics||Some time after President Xi Jinping landed in Ahmedabad on 17 September 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi broached the intrusion by Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Chumar. He asked President Xi to call off the People’s Liberation Army soldiers or he would have to assume that the intrusion was with his knowledge. PM Modi broached the subject again the next day, this time in Delhi. There had been no change in the ground situation in Chumar, a remote corner of the dry desert plateau of the western Himalayas. President Xi said he was “sad” that tensions between the armies had “cast a shadow” on his visit. The PLA backed down after President Xi wrapped up his India visit and reached Beijing.The Doklam stand-off happened three years later, when Indian soldiers stopped the Chinese from building a road into the Doklam bowl. This would have allowed the Chinese military to move vehicles in South Doklam towards the Jampheri ridge that overlooks the Siliguri corridor.Quite like the Chumar, the Doklam stand-off had been initiated by local commanders and was escalated to top military commanders. It ended eventually 73 days later after PM Modi flagged it to President Xi. Both leaders agreed that the standoff was not in the interests of the two nations, setting up the ground for thawing of the freeze in the relationship that led to the withdrawal from both sides.And this, by all accounts is how the Ladakh stand-off is so different from the ones in the past. There is one common denominator in Doklam and Ladakh stand-offs though. General Zhao Zongqi, the PLA’s Western Theater Command’s big boss.“Our understanding is that the Ladakh standoff was driven from the top, unlike the previous two stand-offs,” a senior government official familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times. For one, because the stand-off was preceded by violent scuffles in two military districts before the bloody face-off on June 15.The General behind Doklam and LadakhGeneral Zhao Zongqi is the PLA’s Western Theater Commander Gen Zhao, who has cultivated the reputation of being ruthless, joined the military when he was 15 and has consistently been moved up the ladderThe veteran of several wars has served 20 years in the Tibet Military District and is familiar with the Line of Actual Control under this district that includes the trijunction Bhutan-India-Tibet where the Doklam standoff took place.Gen Zhao, who was stationed as commander of the 52nd Mountain Infantry Brigade, in 1992, focused on strengthening Tibetan border posts. By the time he was out of the Tibet Military Region in 2003, he had moved up as a Major General.The 2016 restructuring of the PLA brought the entire Indian border under one command and not two as before.The first was a violent clash on May 5-6 between Indian and Chinese patrols on the northern bank of Ladakh’s Pangong Tso. Scores of soldiers - from the Indian side and PLA’s Xinjiang military district - were injured in the skirmish involving 250 men.A few days later, a second clash took place on May 9 when heated confrontation between Indian and PLA soldiers from the Tibet military district in north Sikkim’s Naku La area again led to violence. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured during the face-off involving 150 soldiers.The third, on June 15, was the bloodiest and led to the first casualties along the LAC in 45 years.It is only at the level of the top commander that PLA soldiers under different military districts - the Tibet and Xinjiang military districts - would have responded with such striking similarity, an official said, referring to the skirmishes between soldiers in Sikkim and Ladakh in May.Both military districts report to Gen Zhao, who is believed to be directing much of the action along with the Line of Actual Control. Officials, however, indicate that it was unlikely that Gen Zhao, who is not part of the Central Military Commission but has President Xi’s ears, would be acting on his own.This would explain, a diplomat said, why the Chinese army appeared to be taking steps to prolong the stand-off even after foreign ministers of the two countries agreed to implement the understanding reached between top army officers on June 6 on de-escalation of troops from both sides. Or why the June 15 violent scrap still took place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-vs-doklam-standoff-same-military-commander-different-tactics/story-rFrk0WglxYF4RFHyeY5uHJ.html
20-06-2020||India||India again rejects China’s claim over Galwan Valley in Ladakh||India on Saturday again rejected China’s claim on Galwan Valley in Ladakh and reiterated that the violent clash of June 15 was triggered by Chinese efforts to build structures on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The external affairs ministry dismissed claims made by China’s foreign ministry in a statement issued late on Friday night regarding both sovereignty over Galwan Valley and the genesis of the clash on Monday night that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the position with regard to Galwan Valley was “historically clear”. He added, “Attempts by the Chinese side to now advance exaggerated and untenable claims with regard to Line of Actual Control (LAC) there are not acceptable. They are not in accordance with China’s own position in the past.”Srivastava further said the brawl of June 15 was the result of “violent actions” by Chinese troops after they were prevented by Indian soldiers from building structures on the Indian side of the LAC. He noted senior military commanders of the two sides had agreed during a meeting on June 6 on a process for de-escalation and disengagement along the LAC that “involved reciprocal actions”.“Both sides had agreed to respect and abide by the LAC and not undertake any activity to alter the status quo. However, the Chinese side departed from these understandings in respect of the LAC in the Galwan Valley area and sought to erect structures just across the LAC. When this attempt was foiled, Chinese troops took violent actions on June 15, 2020 that directly resulted in casualties,” he said.People familiar with developments said the term “just across the LAC” meant an intrusion into the Indian side of the disputed border but not at great depth.During his phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on June 17, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had conveyed India’s strong protest on “the events leading up to and on the violent face-off” on June 15. “He firmly rejected the unfounded allegations made by the Chinese side and the misrepresentation of the understandings reached between the senior [military] commanders. [Jaishankar] also underlined that it was for China to reassess its actions and take corrective steps,” Srivastava said.The two ministers agreed the overall situation would be “handled in a responsible manner” and both sides would “sincerely” implement the disengagement understanding of June 6.Srivastava said the two sides are in regular touch and early meetings of military and diplomatic mechanisms are currently being discussed. “We expect that the Chinese side will sincerely follow the understanding reached between the foreign ministers to ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas, which is so essential for the overall development of our bilateral relations,” he added.The spokesperson reiterated that Indian troops scrupulously abide by the alignment of the LAC in all sectors, including in Galwan Valley, and the Indian side has “never undertaken any actions across the LAC”. He added Indian troops “have been patrolling” Galwan Valley for a long time without any incident and all infrastructure built by the Indian side is on its side of the LAC.However, Srivastava said that since early May, the Chinese side had hindered India’s normal and traditional patrolling pattern in Galwan Valley and this resulted in a face-off that was addressed by ground commanders in line with bilateral agreements and protocols. “We do not accept the contention that India was unilaterally changing the status quo. On the contrary, we were maintaining it,” he said.In mid-May, the Chinese side “attempted to transgress the LAC in other areas of the Western Sector” of border areas and these attempts were “invariably met with an appropriate response” from the Indian side. The two sides then engaged in discussions through diplomatic and military channels to address the situation.Late on Friday, China claimed Galwan Valley was on the Chinese side of the LAC and had been patrolled by its troops for “many years”. The claim was made in what was described as a “step by step account of the Galwan clash” by Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian.China’s People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) western command had in a statement issued on Tuesday initially claimed the region, saying: “The sovereignty of the Galwan River Valley has always been ours.”On Thursday, Srivastava had dismissed the PLA’s claim as “exaggerated and untenable”.The so-called “step by step account” by Zhao had further claimed that since April, Indian troops had “unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities at the LAC in the Galwan Valley”. He added that “India has gone even further to cross the LAC and make provocations”.Zhao claimed that on June 15, Indian troops “once again crossed the Line of Actual Control for deliberate provocation…and even violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went there for negotiation, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties”.Air Vice Marshal (retired) Manmohan Bahadur, additional director general of the Centre for Air Power Studies and a helicopter pilot with extensive experience of operations along the LAC, said: “When I first flew in that area in 1978, the maps clearly showed the Galwan Valley as Indian territory. The LAC was well east of the confluence of the Shyok and Galwan rivers.“There was never any question about the Galwan Valley and China’s claim on this region is untenable. There was no Chinese activity in the area, or we would have been briefed accordingly. It was well inside our side of the LAC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-again-rejects-china-s-claim-over-galwan-valley-in-ladakh/story-Fs5UJitG7KsgpyV0DDWs5I.html
20-06-2020||India||Pharma firms in U’khand say suppliers hiking prices of Chinese raw materials after Galwan clash||Amid calls of ‘Boycott China’ after the killing of 20 Indian Army soldiers in Galwan Valley near Line of Actual Control (LAC) on June 15, price of raw material for the pharmaceutical industry has increased by upto 30% in the last four days, which could eventually result in costlier medicines, claimed pharmaceutical sector industry owners in Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh have hundreds of pharmaceutical companies and the two states account for almost half of the total medicines produced in India, which, in turn, accounts for 20% of the world’s pharma supplies by volume. According to Central government estimate, the pharma business in India is expected to grow to $ 0 billion by 2022 from about $22 billion in 2019.But, that can happen only if cheaper raw material from China comes without any hindrance, say industry leaders. Most of the raw material for the pharmaceutical industry is imported from China because of the lower cost than locally available salts, they said There are over 100 pharmaceutical manufacturers in Uttarakhand with majority of them operating from State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIDCUL) units of Haridwar and Rudrapur, US Naga district. Himachal has about 300 pharmaceutical factories, mostly situated in the Baddi Industrial town, close to Punjab-Haryana border.A leading pharmaceutical industrialists from Haridwar, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Since the episode in Galwan Valley in Ladakh and ensuing China boycott, the handful of big suppliers of the raw material, imported from China, have now increased its price by upto 30%. They are citing the ongoing situation behind it. But, it seems they are just trying to exploit the situation to earn undue profit.”“These suppliers are a group of 10-12 major players in the country who import the essential raw material and salts for the essential drugs from China and then supply to manufacturers across the country. They have total control over the supply and we are helpless before them. We have to buy the raw material at increased prices, no option. This will ultimately increase the prices for medicines for common man in market,” he said. The industrialist quoted above also said that the suppliers were seeking advance payment for supply the raw material. “Many of them are hoarding it and now asking for advanced payment. It is possible that they will come up with any other condition in next few days to benefit from the situation.”Another industrialist hailing from the sector in Haridwar, corroborated the claim, and said, “Right now we don’t have any other source (for raw material) other than China.”“About 80% of the raw material is imported from China which makes this boycott call totally impractical for us. We can’t import the material from Europe or US which is almost double the price of that from China,” he said. He said that even a basic drug like Paracetamol is based on raw materials from China. “Not only Paracetamol, raw material for all major antibiotics like Augmentin and vitamins come from China at lower prices which enables us to manufacture the drugs at economical prices. We have no option but to continue to import them from China as we have very few Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) units in India, which can supply the raw material at comparable rates with China,” he said. Another pharmaceutical industrialist from Rudrapur in Uttarakhand said, “The ground reality is totally different than what people think while giving such (boycott China) calls.”“I have received the quotation of Paracetamol’s raw material at Rs 395/kg now which was Rs 200/kg two years ago. Everything needed for manufacturing Paracetamol from salt to wrapping sheets comes from China,” he said, claiming that if boycott China is implemented the country would face “severe” shortage of drugs, including live saving ones. “Our pharmaceutical industry is still about 10 years behind China’s.”Confirming the higher prices of material citing the tension between India and China, Anil Sharma, president of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said, “There is some disruption in supply of raw material along with a rise in its price over last few days.”On the call to boycott Chinese products, Sharma said, “We are fully with the country’s sentiments but the ground reality is totally different. Doing so will affect us badly. The government should help in developing the APIs and alternative source of raw material to prevent us from relying on China.”Sunil Kumar, owner of Gujarat based Gaurang International, a major suppliers of raw material for pharma industries, confirmed that the prices of raw material has increased in the past few days because of the boycott call. “It is because we have now reduced the import from there in support of the country’s sentiments to boycott China. It is not that China has increased the prices but we have decreased the import resulting in its hike,” he said.Kumar, however, said that right now there is no alternative source country for raw material. “At present there is no other source of the raw material. But, it’s not like we can’t survive without it. We can put a stop to the import from China by developing APIs in India but that would take time. It can’t be done immediately,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pharma-firms-in-u-khand-say-suppliers-hiking-prices-of-chinese-raw-materials-after-galwan-clash/story-skWPPnfJRk26bkn7LC4ozK.html
20-06-2020||India||BJP widens gap in Rajya Sabha with 86 seats, Cong follows with 41||With the latest round of biennial polls to the Rajya Sabha over, the BJP-led NDA has further widened its gap with the Opposition in the House, with the saffron party now having 86 seats and rival Congress merely 41.The National Democratic Alliance now has nearly 100 members in the 245-member House. If the support of friendly parties like the AIADMK (9), BJD (9), YSR Congress Party (6), and several allied nominated members and smaller parties is counted, then the Modi government is unlikely to face any serious numerical challenge there. The BJP has relied on its strength in the assemblies coupled with defection from other parties, especially the Congress, to boost its strength in the House, where its numerical disadvantage often hindered the Modi government’s legislative agenda in its first term. The Election Commission had announced biennial polls to 61 seats, including 55 in March, but the process was delayed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. With 42 members elected unopposed earlier, the Bharatiya Janata Party won eight, Congress and the YSR Congress four each and others three of the 19 seats that went to polls on Friday. The BJP won a couple of more seats than it could have on the strength of its numbers because of defection from several Congress legislators in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. In total, the BJP won 17, Congress nine, BJP ally JDU three, BJD and the TMC four each, AIADMK and DMK three each, NCP, RJD and the TRS two each, and others rest, official sources said. The crumbling strength of the Opposition, whose key pillars include the Congress, TMC and the Left, has been evident since last year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the BJP to its biggest ever victory as it bagged 303 seats in Lok Sabha election. It prompted a host of defections from the Opposition, including Rajya Sabha members of the Congress, TDP and the Samajwadi Party, to the BJP, and many non-NDA regional parties chose to back the government in Parliament on crucial issues. The Congress has accused the BJP of horse-trading, alleging that it had engineered defections from its ranks for political gains. The government managed big support in Parliament to its resolution to nullify Article 370 and key bills like the bifurcation of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into Union territories and criminal prosecution for instant divorce by Muslim men. The contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was also passed in both the Houses. Out of the 61 new members, 43 are first-timers, which include BJP’s Jyotiraditya Scindia and Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress. Both have been members of Lok Sabha, but lost in elections in 2019. Former prime minister H D Deve Gowda and former Lok Sabha deputy speaker M Thambi Durai have also been elected to Rajya Sabha. The legislative agenda of the Modi government in its first term was often hampered in Parliament due to the Opposition’s numerical superiority in the Upper House, and the Congress had more numbers than the BJP in first few years. However, the BJP’s impressive gains in the assembly elections, coupled with the Congress losing power in several states, resulted in slow but steady rise in the government’s numbers in the House. Though the below-par show of the BJP in state selections since 2018 has also meant that its goal of gaining a majority on its own in the Rajya Sabha remains far from being achieved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-widens-gap-in-rajya-sabha-with-86-seats/story-PH1DPM0qDiqp4e7poVLxJK.html
20-06-2020||India||Plea in Delhi high court against LG’s five-day institutional quarantine order||A plea was filed in the Delhi high court on Saturday, challenging the order issued by Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal a day earlier, which had directed five-day institutional quarantine mandatory for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients. The order was, however, withdrawn on Saturday evening after the LG tweeted that ‘only those COVID positive cases which do not require hospitalisation on clinical assessment and do not have adequate facilities for home isolation would be required to undergo institutional isolation’. The plea, filed by an advocate, Nancy Roy, said that the directions issued by the L-G are harsh, compelling Covid-19 patients to undergo five-day institutional quarantine at a time, when the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is unable to provide an adequate number of beds and nurses for all those, who are in dire need of hospitalisation because of the viral outbreak.The petition, which is likely to come up for hearing next week, said that the Delhi government has already issued press releases to the effect that its entire manpower is stretched, and on top of that, they would have to arrange massive quarantine centres for housing thousands of asymptomatic patients.The plea stated that the order is likely to deter people from undergoing Covid-19 tests for fear of being sent to the government-run quarantine centres.It also cited that “more hospital beds” would be required for these institutional quarantine cases, whereas the critical patients would be left unattended for want of beds.The petition pointed out that the new rule would “overburden isolation centres, which are unhygienic, and could lead to a further spread of the contagion”. It is likely to create more chaos, the plea added.It also contended that the L-G’s order would put senior citizens under tremendous physical and mental hardship.The plea prayed for a quashing of the June 19 order issued by L-G Baijal, as the head of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).Earlier on Saturday, the Delhi government also opposed the L-G’s order. CM Arvind Kejriwal, who met the L-G in the afternoon, questioned the move.“If the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is allowing home-isolation facility for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases across the country, why are different rules being implemented in Delhi?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-delhi-high-court-against-lg-s-five-day-institutional-quarantine-order/story-hGMbMWqxtD2bTfFypNC6GJ.html
20-06-2020||India||Kerala records highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases, breaches 3,000-mark||Kerala’s Covid-19 tally crossed the 3,000-mark on Saturyday with the state reporting 127 new infections, its highest single-day spike so far. The total number of coronavirus patients in the state now stand at 3,039 including 1,450 active cases, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters.Fifty seven people recovered and were discharged from hospitals, the CM added.Saturday was the second consecutive day when Kerala recorded more than 100 positive cases. One hundred and eighteen people had tested for Covid-19 on Friday. The state has witnessed a rapid rise in the number of coronavirus patients with the return of expatriates in the last few weeks.Given the rising numbers of cases among those returning from abroad, the Pinaryai Vijayan government has proposed to make carrying Covid-free certificates mandatory for the expatriates. While the government had initially said these certificates were required only by those taking chartered flights from West Asian countries, it later modified the order to include everyone flying in from abroad.The state government told the Centre on Thursday that it is ready to provide TrueNat testing kits to check expats before they board flights. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the state will provide these kits to Indian missions where testing facilities are not available.

The scheme is aimed at boosting employment and livelihood opportunities for migrant workers, who have returned to their native villages amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions that were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The scheme, which will run for 125 days, is available for only those districts in the country that have received over 25,000 migrant workers.The western UP’s 23 districts have failed to make the grade for the Centre’s new job scheme because of the lack of the number of migrant workers required to qualify for the initiative. The Central government has identified 116 districts across six states under this scheme, including UP, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and Odisha, in a bid to create infrastructure through public works that support job creation in the migrant returnees’ villages.In UP, 31 districts, mostly from the eastern part of the state, have made the cut for the scheme. They are Siddharthnagar, Prayagraj, Gonda Maharajganj, Baharaich, Balrampur, Jaunpur, Hardoi, Azamgarh, Basti, Gorakhpur, Sultanpur, Kushinagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Banda, Ambedkarnagar, Sitapur, Varanasi, Ghazipur, Pratapgarh, Rae Bareli, Ayodhya, Deoria, Amethi, Lakhimpur Kheri, Unnao, Shrawasti, Fatehpur, Mirzapur, Jalaun, and Kaushambi districts.“Eastern UP has been traditionally known for migrant workers, unlike western UP, which is comparatively more prosperous and known for local job creation,” said Suresh Chandra, additional chief secretary (labour).A report, prepared by the office of the relief commissioner and seen by HT, showed that over 26 lakh migrant workers have returned to their respective districts between May 1 and June 11.In some of the western UP districts, such as Ghaziabad, Shamli, Hapur and Meerut, around 1,000 migrants or less than that have returned since the easing of the lockdown restrictions.Ghaziabad brought out the rear with only 289 returnees.On the contrary, eastern UP districts such as Gorakhpur and Prayagraj received over one lakh migrant returnees each.Siddharthnagar topped the state with 1,60,455 and Lucknow accounted for 3,449.The state Panchayati Raj department had collected the data on the migrant returnees during lockdown 1:0 in end-March, when over 5.5 lakh returned home, largely from Delhi-national capital region (NCR).Altogether over 31 lakh migrants have returned to the state to date, the officials added.IN FIGURESTotal no of migrant workers returned to UP between May 1 and June 11: 26,014,49Total no of migrants returned to UP during lockdown 1:0 in end-March: 5,525,64Total no of migrants released from transit camps in UP after screening between May 1 and June 11: 2,578,397Total no of migrants living in transit camps after screening as on June 11: 31,776Total no of migrants sent to dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and care centres after screening till June 11: 20,245Districts receiving most migrants (May 1 to June 11)District Migrant ReturneesSiddharthnagar - 1,604,55Prayagraj - 1,40,331Gonda - 1,179,35Gorakhpur - 1,057,71Sant Kabir Nagar - 1,033,07Districts receiving least/no of migrants District Migrant Returnees Ghaziabad - 289Hapur - 535Shamli - 847 Meerut - 1,001Mathura - 1,844(Source: UP Government)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-enough-reverse-migrants-from-west-up-to-reap-benefits-of-pm-s-garib-kalyan-campaign/story-vHN1w8UCxVXa7H9ldSZLeM.html

The total number of samples tested to detect coronavirus patients stood at 8,61,211, the state health department said.Tamil Nadu reported 2,396 fresh Covid-19 cases and 38 deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of coronavirus cases in the state to 56,845. There are at present 24,822 active Covid-19 cases in the state and the death toll has climbed to 704 with the addition of the 38 fatalities, according to health department data.Tamil Nadu is the second worst-hit state by the coronavirus pandemic, preceded only by Maharashtra. Capital city Chennai has a huge concentration of coronavirus patients and is deemed to be a Covid-19 hotspot.With the strict lockdown enforced in parts of Tamil Nadu entering the second day today,Chief Minister K Palaniswami has described the restrictions as a ‘speed breaker’, saying the curbs were being used to further augment detection of Covid-19 cases in Chennai by conducting more door-to-door surveys and fever camps.Several steps are in place in the state for both early identification and treatment of people who test positive for the infection, the CM said after inspecting quarantine amenities at the Guru Nanak School in Velachery in Chennai city.Tamil Nadu has about 83 testing centres, the highest in the country, with 45 in government and 38 in private sectors.The fever camps in Chennai have been increased to 527 on Friday from about 350 in the recent past and those with Covid-19 symptoms are being treated, the chief minister said.The 12-day lockdown, which came into effect on Friday, is being implemented strictly in Chennai and in parts of neighbouring Chengelpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. Only essential services are allowed and vegetable shops and groceries can function only from 6 am to 2 pm. Ahead of the curbs, relaxations were in place for most segments with the exception of only schools and other educational institutions.The Tamil Nadu Police said action against violators of the lockdown will be taken and their vehicles would be seized if anyone was found violating the norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-strict-lockdown-tamil-nadu-tests-33-231-samples-its-highest-in-a-single-day/story-aHOaS8dMyr9TNQPliyCw6J.html

The cops are also being told about the various kinds of treatments these children may need and whom to contact for their rehabilitation.“The RPF has been rescuing children from traffickers for a long time. But Covid-19 and lockdown have made the situation complicated. Children are being targeted again and need to be protected,” said Mayank, Inspector General, RPF.The RPF needs to be more vigilant in the current situation, he said.“The Covid-19 pandemic compelled nearly 40 million people to migrate from one place to another. This population includes a large number of children. Unfortunately this situation has made many of them soft targets for traffickers as children are being lured to move to other cities for good earnings, said Shivendra Pandya, UNICEF director in Bihar.“It is for the first time that RPF has collaborated with UNICEF for protection of children at railway platforms. The UNICEF has planned online orientation sessions to sensitize RPF officials and the first session was held on June 16 with the RPF of Sonepur division. In the next three four days we will interact with the RPF units of Samastipur, Dhanbad, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Danapur division,” said Gargi Saha from child protection unit of UNICEF Bihar.Among the districts which have witnessed large cases of trafficking of children are Gaya, Nawada, Araria, Supaul, Katihar and Darbhanga, she said.The RPF said it has rescued 2,163 children from 2017 till May 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rpf-unicef-tie-up-in-bihar-to-save-children-from-trafficking-during-covid-pandemic/story-aRTkHMdJSojMS8o6MMquUJ.html

The chief minister said they had requested the Centre to put the exercise on hold in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, but now they have decided to explore legal options as they did not get any adequate response from the Union government. Soren told reporters that the state government has moved the apex court as it is a huge policy decision and there was a need to take into confidence the respective state governments. “Mining has always been a contentious issue in the state. After a long time, a new process is being adopted, which will reinstate the system out of which we came out. Even in the existing system, the locals, landowners could not get their rightful entitlements. There are several issues related to land and displacement in the state,” Soren said. “Several trade unions are out on the streets against the decision. We had requested the Centre not to take any decision in haste. But since we did not get any response to show that the process put in place is transparent and in the interest of the state, we decided to move SC,” he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched the auction of 41 coal blocks under the new regime, under which private miners would be sharing revenues with the government.The blocks are located across Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra.Soren said the union government should have got a fair assessment of adverse social and environmental impact conducted in the state before implementing the new policy. “It seems the Centre is doing this in haste. It is difficult to understand as the entire world is under lockdown. The Centre is expecting foreign investment, but there are several issues including curbs on foreign travel now. Currently, the demand is also low as many industries are shut. So, I don’t find this process of any help now,” Soren added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-moves-sc-challenges-auction-of-coal-blocks-for-commercial-mining/story-cm7pwl91QY3HUpShiVoxAK.html
20-06-2020||India||Babies with Covid-19 may have only mild illness, mostly with fever: Study||Researchers, including an Indian-origin scientist, have shown that infants under 90 days of age who tested positive for Covid-19 tend to be well, with little or no respiratory symptoms. According to the study, published in The Journal of Pediatrics, fever was often found to be the primary or only symptom in new born babies infected with the novel coronavirus. “While there is limited data on infants with Covid-19 from the US, our findings suggest that these babies mostly have mild illness and may not be at higher risk of severe disease as initially reported from China,” said study lead author Leena Mithal from the Northwestern University in the US. “Most of the infants in our study had fever, which suggests that for young infants being evaluated because of fever, Covid-19 may be an important cause, particularly in a region with widespread community activity,” Mithal said. However, she added that evaluation for bacterial infection in young infants with fever remains important. In the study, the researchers assessed 18 infants, none with a significant medical history. Of the 50 percent of these infants who were admitted to the hospital’s general inpatient service, none required oxygen, respiratory support, or intensive care. According to the study, indications for admission were mainly clinical observation, monitoring of feeding tolerance, and ruling-out bacterial infection with empiric intravenous antibiotics in infants younger than 60 days. Of the infants admitted to the hospital, six out of nine had gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as poor feeding, vomiting, and diarrhea. The scientists said upper respiratory tract symptoms of cough and congestion preceded onset of GI symptoms. They said young infants also had notably high viral loads in their nasal specimens despite mild clinical illness. “It is unclear whether young infants with fever and a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 require hospital admission,” Mithal said. “The decision to admit to the hospital is based on age, need for preemptive treatment of bacterial infection, clinical assessment, feeding tolerance, and adequacy of follow-up,” she added. Mithal believes there may be opportunities to utilise rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing to determine disposition of clinically well infants with fever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babies-with-covid-19-may-have-only-mild-illness-mostly-with-fever-study/story-XTjAfakY99XVADEJif11DK.html

We are hopeful to procure by this December. The radio collar will help to track movement of the wild elephants and we can take measures to push them back to forests and thus preventing them from entering human habitations,” Sharma said.Total 50 man-elephant conflict incidents were recorded in the state in 2019-20 with one death. “ We have settled 30 of such cases so far. Rest will also be settled soon,” he said. Currently, the state has 40-50 wild elephants and 62-65 captive elephants. Two groups of elephants are seen in Khowai district and Gomati district, according to Forest Department’s record. Earlier, West Bengal, Uttarakhand, Chhatisgarh and other states used radio collar to minimize conflict. The state government also took a beekeeping project in agricultural lands to prevent elephant attacks and also taken steps to grow bamboo and banana plantations in the forests , which are elephant fodder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-to-procure-first-radio-collar-device-to-curtail-man-elephant-conflict/story-EmT6M9lEtIqzwzhQXYoSwK.html
20-06-2020||India||Goa hoteliers fume as govt drags feet over applications to resume business||Hoteliers in Goa are annoyed with the state government for not allowing businesses to restart almost a fortnight after the Central government’s green light to resume operations under the Unlock 1 guidelines.The Travel and Tourism Association of Goa has pointed out that despite applying for permission as sought by the state government, none have been permitted to resume business. “The 8th of June has been the date on which all the hotels and restaurants were required to open. Many hotels situated in bigger cities in India have already started to operate for business. It is almost 13 days and the industry is waiting for an OK from the Government to start operating all these units,” Nilesh Shah, the president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa, said. The Goa Tourism Department had called for hoteliers to submit applications to reopen as well as an undertaking that they will follow all the guidelines and standard operating procedures as mandated by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Hoteliers had started submitting applications from June 8.Earlier, Director of Tourism Menino D’Souza had said that the Department would then inspect each hotel to ensure compliances before allowing them to restart. “All hotels which are willing to comply with the guidelines, have to apply to the department. We will verify whether they are in a position to comply with the guidelines,” D’Souza had said. The TTAG has however, claimed that despite more than 200 hotels applying to reopen, none have been given the go ahead to do so. “Out of thousands of hotels waiting to reopen we have only about 200 who have applied for permission to reopen. Up to now there has been no go ahead given by our state Government to reopen,” Shah added. Tourism, which is a major revenue earner in Goa, has come to a complete standstill following the lockdown to control the Covid-19 pandemic. The TTAG has claimed that the direct and indirect economic impact of the tourism industry is estimated at 40% of the state’s GDP.The industry has also sought that bars and restaurants also be allowed to reopen in the state as hotels “cannot successfully (reopen) unless the bars and restaurants are given permissions to reopen as well.”Restaurants have been allowed to reopen in the state with only half the capacity but aren’t allowed to serve alcohol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-hoteliers-fume-as-govt-drags-feet-over-applications-to-resume-business/story-eV4UcJOnGMUX7hCz1j0bDM.html
20-06-2020||India||Covid-19 testing declines in Odisha even as cases continue to rise||Odisha’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases may have gone up by around 80% between May 19 and June 19, and the contagion has spread across all 30 districts in the state, but the daily test count has gone down significantly in the interim. The low test count is being attributed to a host of factors such as the malfunctioning of machines and skewed demand and supply ratio among laboratory technicians and frontline workers combating the pandemic.Consider this: Odisha had reported 1,052 Covid-19 positive cases and 22 of the 30 districts in the state were in the pandemic’s clutches on May 19, including 74 cases in a single day and 4,536 tests were conducted on that day alone.A month on, Odisha’s Covid-19 tally stood at 4,836 and the contagion has spread across all the 30 districts. On June 19, 17 laboratories in the state conducted 3,167 tests and the day’s count was 179 fresh Covid-19 positive cases.The state has added over 3,700 or 80% of its total Covid-19 positive cases in exactly a month’s time, triggering panic among the worried state government officials.On June 18, they drew the Supreme Court’s (SC) attention that they anticipate a further spread in the viral outbreak, and pleaded a stay against organising the annual Rath Yatra festival in Puri next week -- a major draw for tourists and pilgrims -- while raising concerns over the maintaining of social distancing norms. The apex court has acceded to the state government’s plea.The state government has also resorted to mandatory weekend shutdowns in 11 worst-hit districts, including Bhubaneswar, in a bid to contain the spread of the viral outbreak.There has also been a growing concern over the mismatch between the daily spike in Covid-19 positive cases and the number of tests being conducted.The laboratories across the state tested 63,709 samples between May 1 and 19 and 868 tested Covid-19 positive, while the corresponding figure between June 1 and 19 was 57,040 and 2,432 positive.The average daily tests between May 1 and 18 stood at 3,540, but came down to 3,169 between June 1 and 18, despite the growing number of Covid-19 positive cases.In May, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had announced that the daily test count would go up to 15,000 from June following the influx of migrant workers from other states amid the nationwide easing of lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the pathogen.Though the daily test count crossed 5,000 for a few days following the CM’s announcement, including 5,612 on May 16, the figure has since then gone down significantly, as the laboratories are conducting tests anywhere between 2,500 and 3,800 on any given day. Last week, Shalini Pandit, director, National Health Mission (NHM), Odisha, defended the low daily test count while citing revised guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which stated that only symptomatic and high-risk contacts need to undergo tests.“We’ve conducted over two lakh tests so far. Besides, the tests per million population in the state is higher than the national average. Positivity rate per lakh population in the state is 9.3%, as compared to Maharashtra (88%), Delhi (205%) and the national average of 25%,” she said.Epidemiologists, however, refused to buy into her arguments and warned against a spike in the viral outbreak, which is likely to have been precipitated by the rising graph of Covid-19 positive cases and an inversely proportionate daily test count.Odisha had reported one Covid-19 positive case in every 250 people tested until end-April. While currently, the corresponding figure stands at 1:26.“This indicated that there is a viral outbreak, which calls for more testing. As per the health protocol, usually about 1% of the population suffers from influenza-type illnesses. At least 4.2 lakh people in Odisha must be in that bracket, who are in dire need of undergoing tests, along with the migrant returnees, who are symptomatic. Aggressive testing, tracing and treating is the only mantra to effectively contain the Covid-19 pandemic,” said an epidemiologist of a government-run hospital, requesting anonymity.Virologist Jacob John, a former principal of Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, said aggressive tests could only help ascertain the spread of the contagion.“People living outside the quarantine centres need to be tested in a bid to come to the conclusion that there’s no community transmission. While this has been the emerging trend in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Delhi, how does one know that’s not the case with Odisha?” he asked.State officials – albeit off the record -- attributed the low test count to malfunctioning machines and the lack of an adequate number of laboratory technicians because of a high daily volume of swab samples.Odisha, however, has failed to overcome this endemic problem, unlike Assam, which is conducting 10,000 Covid-19 tests daily.“In June, the Cobas 6800 machine at Regional Medical Research Laboratory in Bhubaneswar malfunctioned for over 10 days, which led to a major disruption in conducting tests. Similarly, the RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) machine at Institute of Life Sciences in Bhubaneswar could not function for a few days due to non-technical issues. The laboratory technicians, too, are overworked because of an exponential rise in the volume of swab samples. Each sample takes up to 10 hours to test and a technician can only do that much. The state health authorities have been instructing the district collectors to send samples in lesser quantity because of these infrastructural constraints,” said a health official, requesting anonymity.However, the turnaround time for the availability of a test result has come down from five days in mid-May to 48 hours. But slip-ups are being routinely reported such as a government driver in Puri district had to wait for five days in June until his report showed that he has tested Covid-19 negative. “You could well imagine my mental condition. I was worried for all those days, as I was constantly thinking who all I might have infected,” said the driver.Many people, who run the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, are also complaining about the state government’s laxity in denying them the opportunity to undergo tests.For instance, over 80 migrant returnees had staged a sit-in at a high school in Gajapati district – the worst-hit in Odisha – in May as they were not allowed to undergo tests.They claimed that though they were made to spend a fortnight at a quarantine centre, their swab samples were not collected.Similar complaints have come from other quarantine centres in Balasore, Ganjam and Bhadrak districts. “A few of us had been running a fever and were symptomatic. But our swab samples were still not collected,” said a migrant worker at a quarantine centre in Balasore district’s Bahanaga block.Accredited social health activist (ASHA) and Anganwadi workers, who are at the frontline of combating the pandemic such as the collection of swab samples, are finding themselves in a bind because of the growing workload and the skewed demand and supply ratio.In early June, an ASHA worker, Savitri Swain, was assaulted by a group of fishermen from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh in Paradip because they did not want to be quarantined.While in May, ASHA and Anganwadi workers had faced the ire of people at a containment zone in Rourkela town, when they had gone to collect their swab samples.“It’ a real challenge. Many of us don’t have proper personal protective equipment (PPE) units unlike the doctors at dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. We’ve only face masks and hand gloves to protect us from the pathogen. I start my day’s work, dreading when I’d get infected. I’ve no option, but to carry on,” said a health worker, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-testing-declines-in-odisha-even-as-cases-continue-to-rise/story-TRGBwmQMqXw1lu0GTQhf8N.html
20-06-2020||India||‘Decision to resume international flights depends on other countries’: Aviation Minister||India resuming international flights will depend on other countries being open to receive flights, Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Saturday. At the same time, he was hopeful of resuming domestic flights to full capacity by year end.“Any suggestion that international air traffic has opened up and we are the only ones not to open up needs a reality check. The exact time when we will resume international flights depends on other countries to be open to receive flights,” he said.India has suspended international passenger flights since March 22, in a bid to contain the spread of Covid- 19.The minister said that international flights operations depend on airspaces being open and a border acceptance from other countries. “Many countries decided that they were not going to allow nationals from other countries except their own. We also went with the same position,” Puri said. Giving details the minister said, entry is conditional in the US, UK, France, China, UAE and Singapore. “You cannot have normal civil aviation operations under such conditions,” he added.The minister added that in the absence of a decision on resumption of international flights, India is left with no option but to continue “evacuation and repatriation” flights under managed and controlled conditions.He was referring to the government’s initiative in bringing back Indians struck abroad due to Covid-19 pandemic. The Centre had launched the Vande Bharat Mission for this purpose on May 6.The minister said that till date 275,000 Indians have been brought back to the country - 109,000 have returned via the Centre’s Vande Bharat Mission through the national carrier Air India while 143,000 expatriates have been brought back through private carriers.The aviation minister said that during the phase 3 and phase 4 of the mission, private domestic airlines have been approved to operate 750 international flights to repatriate people stranded amid the coronavirus pandemic. The government was constantly trying to expand both domestic and Vande Bharat flights, the minister said, adding that the domestic flight ops would be ramped up.“At present we have allowed only 33% flights to operate and flights are not operating in full capacity even now. We will open more routes where there is more demand. We are ready to take it to up to even 40-45% capacity, Puri added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decision-to-resume-international-flights-depends-on-other-countries-aviation-minister/story-f3yrMlstbb1iFFJhLWXOkO.html
20-06-2020||India||‘Air India a first-class asset’: Hardeep Singh Puri on debt-ridden national carrier||Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Saturday said that national carrier Air India is a first-class asset for the country, whether leading from the front in evacuating stranded Indians from China’s Wuhan or successfully carrying out the Vande Bharat Mission.“I have never been as hopeful and confident on Air India, divestment or disinvestment whatever you choose, as I am now. Air India is a first-class asset. Whether it is for evacuation of people from Wuhan or elsewhere, Air India has been at the heart of it,” the civil aviation minister said.Increasing debt and mounting losses has made the national carrier’s financial position shaky with the government planning to sell its entire stake in Air India Ltd. The government had earlier this year, in January, announced the stake sale in the debt-ridden airline after an attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw any bids.ALSO READ| ‘Decision to resume international flights depends on other countries’: Aviation Minister“Air India and Air India Express are a great entity. They have lucrative slots and bilateral rights. The average age of the aircraft is eight years which in civil aviation terms means a young fleet,” Puri had said earlier.Air India and Air India Express have nearly 51% share of international traffic from India and their employee cost is significantly lower than other international airlines. However, despite the government infusing aid to the tune of Rs 30,500 crore previously, the cash-strapped airline has been incurring losses.More recently, the aviation sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown imposed by the Centre to curb the spread of the infectious disease. After being suspended for almost two months from the end of March, the government resumed domestic flights from May 25, but placed lower and upper limits on airfares depending upon the flight duration. These limits are likely to be in place for a period of three months, the government had announced.The civil aviation minister said the government is planning to add more flights as part of the Vande Bharat Mission in the 3rd and 4th phase to bring back more Indian nationals possibly stranded abroad. Air India CMD Rajiv Bansal also indicated that in phase 4 of the Vande Bharat Mission from July onwards, the airline will have 650 flights. “We are tuning our schedule as per the demand,” Bansal said.The minister on Saturday expressed hope of resuming domestic flights to full capacity by the end of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-a-first-class-asset-hardeep-singh-puri-on-debt-ridden-national-carrier/story-5oj71OrO5IoU0nav2x5eeK.html

Our Army too will give a befitting reply to China but we will also break it economically. That’s why my humble request is to all the people of the state is to be filled with patriotic feelings as has been said by our Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to adopt swadeshi, give preference to local products and boycott Chinese products. India will give a befitting reply to China.”There have been calls for boycott of Chinese products from other parts of the country as well following the Galwan clash. China, one of India’s largest trading partners, has a massive balance of trade advantage.Earlier, Friday afternoon, Chouhan went to Farenda village, about 35 kilometres from Rewa district headquarters where he paid tributes to the fallen soldier.Ahead of the funeral, the chief minister had announced in Bhopal an ex-gratia payment of Rs one crore to the family of Deepak Singh.“The state and the entire country are proud of the supreme sacrifice made by Deepak Singh.

The Puri Rath Yatra was last held up nearly three centuries ago when Mohammed Taqi Khan, deputy governor of Odisha, attacked the Jagannath temple, forcing the shifting of the idols to Ganjam district.“This would be the world’s first digital Rath Yatra which would cover six continents in 24 hours on June 23 and June 24. It would be named ‘Mercy in Wheels’. There would be 108 rathas,” said Subrata Das, communication officer of ISKCON’s headquarters at Mayapur in south Bengal.Also read: Chief servitor of Lord Jagannatha asks SC to allow Puri Ratha Yatra without public participationThe ISKCON Rath Yatra was started by the organization’s founder Srila Prabhupad in San Francisco in 1967.“Being a year of pandemic, devotees won’t be able to go out on the streets and celebrate the festival on a grand scale. Hence the idea was conceived so that Lord Jagannath with Baladev and Subhadra would visit the house of devotees across the world,” said Jayapataka Swami, who conceived the idea of digital Rath Yatra.One has to register for free to become a ‘yajaman’ and receive a code and a link with a scheduled slot with details of the coordinator. Each rath would be pulled by one leader from ISKCON.“On June 23, celebrations will start at Mayapur and could be seen on social networking sites. The rathas would then roll out at around 10 am in 108 directions. The devotee, who has the code, will be able to offer the arti and bhog at the slot allotted to him. The rath would then move to the next yajaman. This will continue till 7:30 am till the next day,” said the spokesman.ISKCON authorities are expecting around 30,000 families to participate in the digital Rath Yatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iskcon-plans-world-s-first-virtual-rath-yatra-across-six-continents-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-FC3iY13U9xUpgxsdbOUEfO.html
20-06-2020||India||Has PM Narendra Modi given clean chit to China by saying no intrusion in Indian territory, asks Chidambaram||Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Saturday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his statement that there had been no intrusion (Chinese) in Indian Territory and asked if the PM has given a “clean chit” to China for the Galwan Valley face-off which claimed the lives of 20 Indian Army personnel.Taking to Twitter, the Congress leader asked five questions to the Central government. One of them enquired why was there a clash between troops on June 16-17 if there was no foreigner in Indian territory.“Prime Minister said there is no foreigner (meaning Chinese) in Indian territory. If this is true, what was the fuss about May 5-6? Why was there a fight between troops on June 16-17? Why did India lose 20 lives?” Chidambaram asked.PM said there is no foreigner (meaning Chinese) in Indian territory. If this is true, what was the fuss about May 5-6? Why was there a fight between troops on June 16-17? Why did India lose 20 lives?During the all-party meeting on Friday PM Modi had said that “neither is anyone inside our territory nor is any of our post captured” and 20 brave soldiers made the supreme sacrifice for the nation during a violent clash with Chinese troops in Galwan Valley and also taught a lesson to those “who had dared to look towards our motherland”.Chidambaram also questioned the government over the need to hold talks about “disengagement” of troops by China and India if there was no intrusion.“If there was no intrusion or violation of LAC, why was there so much talk about “disengagement” of troops by both sides? If there was no intrusion by Chinese troops at all, what did the Corps Commanders talk about on June 6? Was it about the weather?” he wrote.Quoting Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, he asked if no Chinese troops had crossed the LAC into Indian territory, why did the Foreign Minister’s statement refer to “restoration of status quo ante”?“Has the Prime Minister given a clean chit to China? If so, what is there to negotiate with China? Why are the Major Generals negotiating and about what?”, he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/has-pm-narendra-modi-given-clean-chit-to-china-by-saying-no-intrusion-in-indian-territory-asks-chidambaram/story-73vfpXyq7Ek4tUXRLW2OzN.html
20-06-2020||India||‘Mischievous interpretation’: Govt on PM Modi’s remarks at all-party meet||The government on Saturday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comments at an all-party meeting, called to discuss the situation along the India-China border, have been misinterpreted.On Friday, PM Modi told an all-party meeting that there has been no intrusion into Indian territory. “Attempts are being made in some quarters to give a mischievous interpretation to remarks by the Prime Minister at the all-party meeting yesterday. The Prime Minister was clear that India would respond firmly to any attempts to transgress the LAC. In fact, he specifically emphasised that in contrast to the past neglect of such challenges, Indian forces now decisively counter any violations of LAC (“unhe rokte hain, unhe tokte hain”),” read a statement from the Prime Minister’s office (PMO).After the PM categorically said on Friday that “neither has anyone entered Indian territory, nor is anyone present in Indian territory currently, and nor is any Indian post captured”, opposition parties had criticised the statement. Twenty Indian soldiers died in the line of duty in brutal hand-to-hand combat with the Chinese troops on Monday.The Congress party on Saturday said PM Modi’s concluding statements at the all-party meeting had contradicted the earlier statements made by the Army chief, the defence Minister and the foreign minister. The party asked if no Chinese troops had crossed the LAC, what was the reason for the face-off. The government, however, rebutted the opposition‘s criticism and said that the all-party meeting was informed that this time Chinese forces have come in much larger strength to the LAC and that the Indian response is commensurate. “As regards transgression at the LAC, it was clearly stated that the violence in Galwan on June 15 arose because Chinese side was seeking to erect structures just across the LAC and refused to desist from such actions,” the government said in a statement.The statement went on to say that the PM’s observations that there was no Chinese presence on our side of the LAC pertain to the situation as a consequence of the bravery of the Armed Forces. “The sacrifice of the soldiers of the 16 Bihar Regiment for the attempts of the Chinese side to erect structures and also cleared the attempted transgression at this point of the LAC on that day. The words of the PM, “ those who try to transgress our land were taught a befitting lesson by the brave sons of soil”, succinctly summed up the ethos and values of the Armed Forces”, the statement read.The union government said an unnecessary controversy is being created to lower the morale of the soldiers for defending the borders. “What is Indian territory is clear from the map of India. This government is strongly and resolutely committed to that,” it added. Any unilateral change of the LAC will not be allowed, the government added.The government further asserted that all parties extended support to the government and the forces.“The predominant sentiment at the meeting was of unequivocal support to the government and the armed forces at a time of national crisis. We are confident that the unity of the Indian people will not be undermined by motivated propaganda,” said the government. The PM had assured the opposition parties that whether it is deployment, action or counter action Indian forces – be it on land, in the air or in water are doing everything to protect our borders. The infrastructure development in border areas has gained in pace over the past years, he said, adding it has strengthened our patrolling capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unnecessary-controversy-govt-on-pm-modi-s-comments-at-all-party-meet/story-Fe2UgMKw3ZBBZ1abD2APVM.html

It is expected to increase to Rs 1,510 crore by October, he said.The official also informed that 69 extra high tension sub-stations and transmission lines were installed in the last three years to reduce the transmission loss.An amount of Rs 6324.62 crore is pending against bills from different categories of consumers, the meeting was told.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-says-returnee-migrants-to-get-jobs-in-power-firms/story-fZONRPhpLC4RAzbWXP67rO.html
20-06-2020||India||Contact tracing still a crucial tool to curb spread of coronavirus, say experts||Amid the frantic search for a vaccine for the coronavirus infection, contact tracing of patients continues to be a crucial tool to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have suggested. The Union health ministry too has emphasized on the need for contact tracing of those who test positive for Covid-19, to ensure that the health infrastructure of the country is not overwhelmed. The health ministry has advised state governments to adopt containment practices to suit local needs and pay attention to contacts of those who test Covid-19 positive, which would in turn help to curb the spread in their specific states. What is Contact Tracing?Contact tracing is the process of alerting unwitting people to the danger of infection so that they can take appropriate action. When someone tests positive for any disease, health workers interview that individual about the people they can remember interacting with over the previous few weeks. Those people are then warned about possible exposure and asked to get a test done. If they turn out to be infected, their contacts are also informed. It’s a public health technique that has been used for decades globally to contain tuberculosis and measles epidemics, as well as HIV/AIDS, according to a report by The Washington Post.ALSO READ | Contact tracing apps won’t elicit honest symptom reporting: Harvard epidemiologistCloser home, the health ministry has appreciated Karnataka’s methods for Covid-19 management, which includes comprehensive contact tracing of Covid-19 positive cases and physical or phone-based survey that has covered more than 1.5 crore households in the state.The Karnataka government has over a period of time effectively traced and tracked each positive case and their contacts, hence successfully containing the spread of the infectious disease, the Ministry said. Karnataka has one of the lowest coronavirus case counts in the country, compared to neighbouring Tamil Nadu, which with over 50,000 cases is now at second spot and among the worst-hit states by the pandemic.Karnataka has also widened the definition of ‘contact’ to include both high risk and low risk categories as defined by the Union health ministry.ALSO READ | Covid-19: Phones may hold key to catching up with the pandemicIn Maharashtra, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday asked district collectors to appoint a task force of expert doctors to curb Covid-19-related deaths, and warned against complacency in tracing patients and their contacts.“After the easing of lockdown restrictions earlier this month, there has been an increase in the number of patients in some districts. Tracing patients and their contacts expeditiously is very important and the only solution. There should be no complacency in contact tracing,” the Maharashtra chief minister said.Contact tracing and proper testing may go a long way in helping to curb the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases in India. According to The Washington Post report, mitigation as a method uses just enough of both techniques to slow down the disease for some time, but not enough to eradicate it totally. Suppression, on the other hand involves a hike in testing capacity and aggressive contact tracing strong enough to interrupt the chain of transmission.Suppression, if countries can follow it, is obviously the better choice to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contact-tracing-still-a-crucial-tool-to-curb-spread-of-coronavirus-say-experts/story-holBfzivKlh12y9dhObzjN.html

The national capital where the Covid-19 tally has gone past 53,000 has been battling a massive surge in the rate of infections in recent weeks. The order comes a day after Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal ordered five-day institutional quarantine for asymptomatic Covid-19 patients before they are sent for home quarantineOn Saturday, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal raised concerns over the LG’s order saying there will be chaos if home isolation of Covid-19 patients ends and every asymptomatic patient is sent to institutional quarantine.Earlier this month, the government estimated Delhi could have over 5.5 lakh cases of Covid-19 by the end of July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-delhi-govt-cancels-leaves-of-staff-of-state-run-hospitals/story-AiWMiwLeCIhRW1QKkMPdFO.html
20-06-2020||India||Chief servitor of Lord Jagannatha asks SC to allow Puri Ratha Yatra without public participation||Janardhan Pattajoshi Mohapatra, who is the hereditary chief servitor of Lord Jagannatha of the Jagannatha Temple at Puri, Odisha, moved the Supreme Court on Friday seeking recall of the top court’s June 18 order which had barred holding of the annual Hindu festival of Rath Yatra this year in view of the threat posed by Covid-19 pandemic.Mohapatra submitted that the Rath Yatra has an unbroken tradition and is an essential practice of the Jagannatha temple which the temple administrators should mandatorily observe under all circumstance.“Any interruption in the observance of this mandatory religious practice affects the very sanctity of the temple and all its future rituals as well as the faith of millions of devotees across the world who understand and revere the significance of the Rath Yatra,” the application stated.Also read: Puri Shankaracharya, priests want SC to review stay on Rath YatraMohapatra, therefore, suggested that instead of imposing a blanket ban on the Rath Yatra and the festival and rituals associated with it, the festival can be held without public participation by imposing a curfew in Puri and closing the city borders.“If a curfew is imposed on the day of Rath Yatra and the Rathas are pulled with the help of earthmovers, the entire journey of Lord Jagannatha - from the Shri Jagannath Temple to Gundicha mandir - of around 2.8 kilometres can be completed in less than one hour. An absolute bar on the performance of such an essential ritual is not necessary to protect public health,” the application filed through advocate Suvidutt Sundaram stated.The Rath Yatra is a festival associated with Lord Jagannatha. It was scheduled to commence this year on June 23. The festival lasts for 10 to 12 days and involves a procession of chariots containing the deity Lord Jagannatha, his brother Lord Balabhadra and sister Devi Subhadra.The Supreme Court had ordered a stay on the festival and all activities associated with it this year stating that allowing the same would lead to a congregation of more than 10 lakh devotees in violation of social distancing norms which could compromise public health and safety amid the Covid-19 pandemic.This order was passed in a petition filed by an NGO, Odisha Vikas Parishad, which had moved the top court pointing out the public health risk involved if the annual event is allowed to take place.The NGO referred to the Tablighi Jamaat incident - a religious congregation held in mid-March at the Nizamuddin area in Delhi - which led to a spurt in Covid-19 cases across the country after people from the Muslim community from all across the country and even from abroad had attended the event.“Of about 4,400 Covid-19 positive cases in India as on April 7, nearly one third were related to the religious gathering at the Markaz, Delhi. Thus, in order to avoid any similar instances of outbreak of Covid-19 cases, a religious gathering in the nature of Rath Yatra festival ought to be avoided,” the petition had stated.“Having regard to the danger presented by such a large gathering of people for the Rath Yatra, we consider it appropriate in the interests of public health and safety of citizens who are devotees to restrain the respondents (state and district authorities and the managing committee of Jagannatha temple) from holding the Rath Yatra this year,” the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde had ordered.The court had also directed that no such Rath Yatra should be allowed in any other part of Odisha.Mohapatra pointed out that the Rath Yatra has been conducted under all circumstances since time immemorial including during the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918.“The Rath Yatra is an essential, mandatory, integral and indispensable religious practice which has scriptural sanction. Non-conduct of the Rath Yatra has consequences not only for the sanctity of the temple but also for the society in general,” his application said.He, therefore, suggested that the state government may make an announcement that the Rath Yatra will be conducted with absolutely no participation from the public and strict penal consequences will follow if any attempt is made to enter Puri during the Rath Yatra.“Arrangements for live-broadcasting of the Rath Yatra may be allowed like every year to enable crores of devotees across the world, including the residents of Puri, to have Darshan of the three deities”, the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-chief-servitor-of-lord-jagannatha-asks-sc-to-allow-puri-ratha-yatra-without-public-participation/story-bJvBzCkYWqLuub2oHZ3IWJ.html

20-06-2020||India||In Madhya Pradesh, BJP MLA, wife test Covid-19 positive, cause flutter among lawmakers||A BJP MLA and his wife tested positive for Covid-19 causing a flutter in the BJP state unit and Congress both and also among the assembly staff as the MLA had attended the BJP legislature party meetings on Wednesday and Thursday and cast his vote during the Rajya Sabha polls held at the assembly premises on Friday, according to legislators from Congress and BJP.The MLA happens to be the second legislator in the state to be infected with Covid-19. Earlier, a Congress MLA tested positive for the virus. He turned up in a personal protective equipment (PPE) kit in the state assembly on Friday afternoon to cast his vote. He, however, had been given the facility of a postal ballot that he didn’t go for. The state Congress has accused the BJP MLA of putting in peril the life of other legislators including chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan who chaired the BJP legislature party meetings and also cast his vote in RS polls, state assembly secretariat staff and the selected media people who were allowed to cover the Rajya Sabha polls amid the Covid-19 situation.State Congress spokesperson Ajay Yadav said, “We have learnt that the BJP MLA got samples of his wife and himself tested for coronavirus two days back but still he attended the BJP legislature party meetings, mingled with other MLAs and BJP leaders. He has committed a grave offence by concealing the information about his health and he should be immediately booked for spreading the virus knowingly as was done in several other cases in the state.”The MLA confirmed that he and his wife had tested positive for Covid-19. However, he said, they went for the test on Friday only.“When my wife complained about fever we got our samples tested on Friday. Now we are going to be hospitalised,” the MLA said over phone.State BJP spokesperson and MLA Rameshwar Sharma said, “I can’t comment on whether the MLA knew about his health conditions but we are alert about our health and consulting doctors as to what to do. However, certain MLAs have gone to hospitals too for their test today. Another concern is many MLAs who came from other districts to Bhopal to cast their votes have returned to their homes. If any of these MLAs test positive for coronavirus, his family members too will be prone to contracting the disease and so will the others who are in contact with him.”Congress MLA and former minister PC Sharma said, “Certainly we were all almost together in a closed area during the poll. I was the election agent for the party candidate Digvijaya Singh. In that capacity, I met the assembly staff too and received the certificate of election from the returning officer in presence of several others. Even otherwise, we put signatures on papers that might have been touched by the infected MLA too. Some MLAs have gone to the government hospital for their test. We are also consulting doctors.”State assembly principal secretary and returning officer for Rajya Sabha election AP Singh said, “We all followed all required safety measures including social distancing norms and the state assembly premises was sanitised on Friday. But it’s a matter of concern if the MLA removed his face mask to talk to others or some legislators and others might have come close to him. That’s why we are looking at the CCTV footage to find out if the infected MLA had removed his face mask while interacting with other MLAs and to know how many MLAs and assembly staff came in contact with him or stood close to him.”As many as 206 MLAs cast their votes on Friday during the Rajya Sabha polls. They include the Congress MLA who tested positive for coronavirus. He, however, appeared in a PPE kit to cast his vote. The other MLAs include 107 from BJP including chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and five ministers, 91 from Congress, four independent, 2 BSP and 1 SP MLAs. The Rajya Sabha candidates Digvijaya Singh from Congress and Sumer Singh Solanki from BJP were also there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-madhya-pradesh-bjp-mla-wife-test-covid-19-positive-cause-flutter-among-lawmakers/story-BMVIJrnW7j5VROr6L3CYQM.html

She needed an immediate liver transplant to save her life, doctors said.As her stomach started bloating, the helpless father started knocking on many doors. His prayers were half-heard when the doctors found that he’s a matching donor for his daughter. Byju was now faced with the challenge to arrange Rs 20 lakh for the transplant - that too at a shorter notice. Such a huge amount was tough to arrange especially amid the Covid-19 crisis. But Byju’s resolve was strong and he was not ready to give up that easily.Also read: ‘Covid Rani’ - Kerala Congress chief mocks state health minister KK ShailajaBut there was light at the end of the tunnel, thanks to a crowd-funding platform the smile on the faces of the little one and the proud father is back. “I had lost all hopes.

The deaths were initially considered as mysterious as the autopsy reports did not highlight any trace of liquor in some of the bodies but the state government clarified that the 16 died after drinking poisonous liquor.People in Khajurbani, a settlement of Mahadalit Pasis and some OBC groups, use a flower, Mahua, to brew illicit liquor. Most of the 16 people who died in the suspected hooch tragedy are said to have consumed liquor from this area on the night of August 15.The entire police staff of Town police station was suspended hours after the incident and faced departmental enquiry, according to the police headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/21-bihar-policemen-dismissed-over-2016-gopalganj-hooch-tragedy/story-XBaqaHtRwVVb7WGoaD80KI.html
20-06-2020||India||India posts PM Modi’s remarks on Ladakh face-off, China’s WeChat app deletes it||A popular Chinese social media app, WeChat, has removed updates by the Embassy of India (EoI) on the current border conflict including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement on the clash that left 20 Indian Army soldiers dead.The reasons given for the removal of the posts include divulging state secrets and endangering national security.The updates published on WeChat, a popular social media app, included Modi’s remarks on the India-China border situation, the phone call between the Indian and Chinese foreign ministers held on Thursday and a statement by the external affairs ministry’s (MEA) spokesperson.A day earlier, the EoI had to issue a clarification on its Chinese Twitter-like Weibo account after the same statement by the MEA spokesperson was deleted.Embassy officials had to then clarify to its readers that the post wasn’t removed by them, and re-published a screen-shot of the statement in Chinese.While the statements put on WeChat were in English, the EoI’s Weibo account was carrying a Chinese version of the Indian ministry’s version of the events at the border in eastern Ladakh.The sudden removal of the Indian government’s posts from its official accounts on Chinese social media comes in the backdrop of the violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley region earlier this week.While 20 Indian Army soldiers died, the Chinese government has so far not revealed the casualties suffered by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) though official Chinese media have admitted that there were casualties on both sides.Followers of the EoI’s official account on WeChat first noticed the discrepancy on Saturday morning.On clicking two of the statements on WeChat, the message that pops-up says the posts were “…deleted by the author”.It was learnt that the EoI did not remove any of the posts.For the third post on WeChat, the MEA spokesperson’s statement, the message says: “Unable to view this content because it violates regulations”.It then gets serious because of the nature of the regulations the statement is said to have violated – endangering national security.The message continues: “This content was reported and confirmed by the platform of the following:” before it says in Mandarin: “Suspected of violating relevant laws, regulations and policies”.As it then turns out, according to WeChat, the spokesperson’s statement was removed because it carried “…contents prohibited by laws and regulations of the state.”The long list of regulations include: “endangers national security, divulges state secrets, subverts state power, or undermines national unity, inciting hatred, disseminating false information, inciting illegal assembly, demonstration or gathering of people to disturb public order”.Prime Minister Modi also has a Weibo account, which was opened when he came to China in May, 2015.The Hindustan Times has reached out to WeChat for a comment on its decision to take down the EoI official posts.WeChat is among the most popular social media apps in China, and claims to have more than 1 billion users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-social-media-deletes-modi-s-speech-india-s-statement-on-border-row/story-j53yLW7WpXFpKOHxlrMgVP.html

The meeting was called upon to discuss Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal’s latest directive which makes 5-day institutional quarantine mandatory for all Covid-19 patients. “Currently, there are more than 10,000 people under home isolation and there are only 6,000 beds at quarantine centres, where will we accommodate all the people?” the chief minister said during the meeting. Kejriwal also said that the move will shift the entire focus from moderate and serious patients of Covid-19 to those who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Chief Minister said if home isolation ends in Delhi there will be chaos.

Should our primary focus be on the serious patients or the asymptomatic or mild persons who actually need no medical treatment as such?” Kejriwal reportedly asked the L-G in the meeting.Kejriwal also said that move will lead to people avoid getting tested for Covid-19 owing to the fear of being whisked away to quarantine centres. “Why are there different rules for Delhi when the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is allowing home-isolation for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases across the country?” the CM reasoned. The L-G’s order on Friday added that after the five-day institutional quarantine, asymptomatic Covid-19 patients will be sent for home quarantine.“Five days institutional quarantine of each case under home-quarantine is to be made mandatory and, thereafter, (they) will be sent for home-isolation, except in cases where symptoms require further hospitalization,” Baijal said in his order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-will-be-chaos-where-will-we-accommodate-people-kejriwal-on-5-day-institutional-covid-19-quarantine/story-PZyzm47zqtMp74pb6yt9dN.html

Glenmark will certainly make a consideration to support private and public healthcare facilities and arrange for other suitable options as per the need and in time”.The Mumbai-based firm had on Friday received the manufacturing and marketing approval from the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI).”This approval comes at a time when cases in India are spiralling like never before, putting a tremendous pressure on our healthcare system,” Glenmark Pharmaceuticals Chairman and MD Glenn Saldanha said.The company hopes that the availability of an effective treatment such as FabiFlu will considerably help assuage this pressure, and offer patients in India a much needed and timely therapy option, he added.Glenmark will work closely with the government and medical community to make FabiFlu quickly accessible to patients across the country, Saldanha noted.The company has developed the API and the formulation for FabiFlu through its in-house research and development team, Glenmark said.“We chose to initiate work on Favipiravir, as it has proven in-vitro activity against SARS CoV2 virus, which is the virus responsible for Covid-19.“Second is it has a wide therapeutic safety margin for Covid-19 at the dose that we administer,” Glenmark Pharmaceuticals President India Formulations, Middle East and Africa Sujesh Vasudevan said at an online press conference.Moreover, it is an oral product and that is a huge benefit especially when the hospital infrastructure is under strain, he added.Manufacturing and marketing consent has been granted as part of an accelerated approval process, considering the emergency situation of Covid-19 outbreak in India, the drugmaker said.The approval’s restricted use entails responsible medication usage where every patient must have signed informed consent before treatment initiation, it added.Favipiravir can be used for coronavirus patients with co-morbid conditions such as diabetes and heart disease with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms, Glenmark said.It offers rapid reduction in viral load within four days and provides faster symptomatic and radiological improvement.Favipiravir has shown clinical improvement of up to 88 per cent in mild to moderate COVID-19 cases, it said.Favipiravir has been approved in Japan since 2014 for the treatment of novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections.Last month, Glenmark also announced that it is conducting another clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of two antivirals Favipiravir and Umifenovir as a combination therapy in moderate hospitalised adult COVID-19 patients in India.India on Saturday saw another record spike of 14,516 new COVID-19 cases in a single day, pushing the tally to 3,95,048, while the death toll rose to 12,948 with 375 new fatalities, according to Union Health Ministry data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glenmark-launches-covid-19-drug-after-dcgi-nod/story-kwOjjcAbv7zQ1Sksw8qXbP.html
20-06-2020||India||‘Mischievous’: PMO responds to barbs over Modi remarks on Ladakh face-off||The Prime Minister’s Office on Saturday responded to stinging barbs from the Congress over his remarks at the all party meeting that neither has anyone entered Indian territory, nor is anyone present in Indian territory currently, and nor is any Indian post captured.Congress leaders have been tweeting jabs at the government ever since, asking if the Galwan region where the violent face-off took place, wasn’t Indian territory. Rahul Gandhi, one of the first senior leaders to question PM Modi over his remarks had tweeted: “PM has surrendered Indian territory to Chinese aggression. If the land was Chinese: Why were our soldiers killed? Where were they killed”.Also Watch | ‘China didn’t enter our territory…’: PM Modi at all-party meet on Ladakh clash The government statement called this criticism an attempt to give a “mischievous interpretation” to PM Modi’s remarks.The PMO said Modi’s remarks had focused on the June 15 face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers at Galwan that led to the loss of lives of 20 Indian soldiers.“The Prime Minister’s observations that there was no Chinese presence on our side of the LAC (Line of Actual Control) pertained to the situation as a consequence of the bravery of our armed forces,” the statement said.“The sacrifices of the soldiers of the 16 Bihar Regiment foiled the attempt of the Chinese side to erect structures and also cleared the attempted transgression at this point of the LAC on that day,” the PMO added .The government said the all-party meeting was informed that this time Chinese forces have come in much larger strength to the LAC and that the Indian response is commensurate. “As regards transgression of LAC, it was clearly stated that the violence in Gallan on 15 June arose because Chinese side was seeking to erect structures just across the LAC and Refused to desist from such actions,” said the PMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mischievous-interpretation-says-government-on-congress-barbs-over-pm-modi-s-ladakh-stand-off-statement/story-3XvXY3KsiamUzN0CJ6u0yH.html
20-06-2020||India||Air Force chief was asked if he has a message for enemy. His reply||India is not expecting a war with China on the border issue, but is fully battle-ready if such a situation arises, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria underscored on Saturday.“We are not at war with China, but we fully geared up to meet any contingency arising out the recent conflict on the Line of Actual Control (LAC),” Bhadauria said, while interacting with reporters after reviewing the combined graduation parade of 123 Indian Air Force cadets at Air Force Academy at Dundigal on the outskirts of Hyderabad.Replying to a query on his assessment of the situation on the LAC in the wake of his visit to the airbases in Leh and Srinagar in the last two days, the Air Chief Marshal said the army was in full control of the situation at Galwan valley, the site where 20 Indian soldiers died in the line of duty while fighting the Chinese troops.“The army has already given a statement to this effect. At the same time, our Air Force is also ready to supplement the efforts of the army by deploying additional battalions to meet the contingency, if required,” he said.Asked whether the more fighter aircraft would be moved to Leh and Srinagar in view of his visits, Bhadauria said the IAF has airbases at several strategic locations in the country, not just Leh. “We shall assess the situation and go about with our deployments. However, we have stepped up our deployments after the recent conflicts with China post-May,” he said.To another question, he said the Air Force was capable of handling the situation in high altitude regions, but for tactical reasons it cannot disclose where and how the deployments would be made. “We shall do and we are doing it as per the requirements,” he said.Asked what message he wants to send to the adversaries, Bhadauria said India did not want to send any message to its adversaries but would always be prepared to defend its territories. “Why should I send any message to the adversaries,” he said. The air force chief said the IAF cadets who had graduated on Saturday would be directly reporting to their assigned squadrons and units in view of the current situation so that they would get into action whenever it was required.Earlier, addressing the newly graduated cadets, Bhadauria said the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers at Galwan valley in Ladakh would not go in vain.“It should be very clear that we are well prepared and suitably deployed to respond to any contingency. I assure the nation that we are determined to deliver and will never let the sacrifice of our braves of Galwan go in vain,” he said.The forces were well prepared and suitable equipment was in place, he said, adding that the face off at Ladakh was a small snapshot of what the armed forces were required to handle at a short notice.In spite of unacceptable Chinese actions after agreements reached during military talks and resultant loss of life, all efforts are being made to ensure that the current situation at the LAC is resolved peacefully, he said.“Please join me in paying tribute to Colonel Santosh Babu and his brave men who made the sacrifice while defending the LAC in Galwan Valley. The gallant actions in a highly challenging situation have demonstrated our resolve to protect India’s sovereignty at any cost,” Bhadauria said.The IAF chief conferred the ‘President’s Commission’ to 123 graduating trainees, including 19 women cadets, of various branches. The ceremony comprised presentation of ‘Wings’ and ‘Brevets’ to the Flight Cadets who successfully completed Flying and Navigation training respectively.The parade was followed by a brief, but spectacular air show by Pilatus, Kiran Hawk, Chetak helicopters and an aerobatic display by Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT) of the IAF.The graduating IAF cadets, officers and all the dignitaries who attended the ceremony wore face masks and maintained social distance in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The parents of the cadets were also not allowed to view the parade this time because of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-at-war-with-china-but-fully-prepared-says-air-force-chief-bhadauria/story-Lhs3mpn1DfBIGcWkmMTUnM.html

20-06-2020||India||Not just India’s Galwan, China has a long list of territorial disputes||Military commanders of Indian and Chinese armies have been holding several rounds of talks to resolve the impasse at the four stand-off points in eastern Ladakh as the soldiers. The meetings at Galwan region’s Patrolling Point 14 - the site of a bloody clash on Monday evening that killed 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number from the Chinese side - have helped lower the tension at the border but from all available indicators, the two sides are far from a resolution. Patrolling Point 14 is in control of the Indian army but the Chinese People’s Liberation Army soldiers - which now claims Galwan valley as Chinese territory - are standing close by maintaining the face-off.India’s border dispute with China that blew up this week takes the shine off the many agreements between the two sides not to let differences turn into disputes. At Galwan, President Xi Jingping’s PLA is trying to create a new one.Also Read: Ladakh isn’t South China Sea, will not allow status quo to change: OfficialAnd it isn’t only on its border with India that President Xi’s China has manufactured a problem. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking during an online conference on democracy, attacked China for its “rogue” attitude in its entire neighbourhood. The US Navy has deployed its 300,000 tonne aircraft carriers to the Pacific Ocean on June 15. This is the first biggest deployment of US super-carriers - USS Ronald Reagan, USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Nimitz - since 2017. While the US has not attributed any security motives to the deployment, it is quite evident that the move is to counter Chinese aggressive posture over Taiwan.BhutanThe last stand-off between India and China was over Beijing’s encroachment and construction activities at Doklam, at the India-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction, that continued for 73 days. China had backed out as part of the peace deal between India and China but according to multiple reports, was back at its game. There have been similar such encroachments, construction activities and cases where Chinese patrols have intimidated Bhutanese graziers from accessing pasture lands within Bhutan territory in other sectors of Bhutan-China borders.South China SeaChina has been flexing its muscles for complete control over the resource-rich South China Sea. China’s claim to the waters based on “historic rights” was turned down by a 2016 arbitration ruling but that hasn’t stopped China from amping up efforts to militarise the zone.That South China sea is one of the world’s busiest maritime trade routes that serves as a passage for annual trade worth $ 3.5 trillion implies that this territorial claim impacts not just its smaller neighbours, but a larger number of countries.To be sure, China has island and maritime border disputes with Taiwan, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam in the South China Sea and its extension. The disputes include islands, reefs, banks and other features in the South China Sea including Spratly Islands (with Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan), Paracel Islands (Vietnam), Scarborough Shoal (Philippines), and Gulf of Tonkin (Vietnam).In addition, China claims the entire Taiwan and its controlled islands as its own.Eastern China SeaChina has Exclusive Economic Zone disputes with North Korea, South Korea and Japan in the Yellow Sea (North Koren/South Korea) and East China Sea (South Korea/Japan). In addition, China claims Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands of Japan. The area again sees a huge intra-region and global trade and Chinese claim would spill over the region and affect many more countries beyond the immediate region.NepalAround the same time that Kathmandu had objected to a fresh map issued by India last year, Nepal’s Survey Department had accused China of having encroached Nepali land in northern districts of Humla, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Sankhuwasabha. There were protests against China in Nepal after this survey report was leaked but Nepal’s communist party didn’t escalate the border dispute with China that has been pouring billions of rupees in investments into the country and kept the spotlight firmly on India’s map instead. China has also initiated an exercise to measure the height of Mount Everest and installed telecommunication equipment to provide 5G services on it. In May, the state-run China Global Television Network claimed Mount Everest as part of China in a tweet but deleted the post after outrage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-just-india-s-galwan-china-has-a-long-list-of-territorial-disputes/story-DN10LXdhdjljSVgvsLpeSM.html
20-06-2020||India||PM Modi launches Rs 50,000-crore Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan, a Rs 50,000 crore dedicated programme to create jobs for millions of migrant workers who returned home during the coronavirus-induced lockdown across the country.The Prime Minister launched the programme, which will be a “focused campaign” and run in “mission mode” for 125 days across 116 districts in six states to help migrant workers get jobs in their home states, via video conference.The programme, which started from Telihar village of Bihar’s Khagaria district, will cover India’s 116 districts across Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha.“The country understands your emotions and your needs. The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan starting from Khagaria in Bihar is a major tool to fulfil this need and emotion,” PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also interacted with several people who came back home to Bihar from several places across the country, including Delhi, Gurugram, Rajasthan. Union minister of rural development Narendra Singh Tomar and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar were among those who were present during the launch.The largest number of migrant workers (three million) have returned to Bihar since the Covid-19 pandemic swept through the country leaving daily-wage labourers jobless in big cities.The government has said the programme, aimed to boost livelihood opportunities in rural India, will “create durable infrastructure along with boosting employment opportunities”.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said on Thursday that the move will not involve new budgetary allocation—the 25 schemes will be front-loaded, utilising in 125 days the allocation meant for the year.Sitharaman had said that in 125 days, nearly 25 schemes will be brought together to reach saturation and will include Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, Gram Sadak Yojna, Jal Jeevan Yojna and PM Gram Sadak Yojna among others.Laying of fibre optics cable, railway works, rurban mission jobs, sanitation works, waste management, poultry, farm ponds and training through Krishi Vigyan Kendras will be given to the migrant workers under the programme.Twelve different ministries or departments—rural development, panchayati raj, transport, mines, drinking water, environment, railways, petroleum, new and renewable energy, border roads, telecom and agriculture—will participate in the programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-launches-rs-50-000-crore-garib-kalyan-rojgar-abhiyaan-to-generate-jobs/story-xo36Sp8aBFn4nagoNx9AEO.html
20-06-2020||India||Pak-origin Canadian arrested, faces extradition for role in 26/11 Mumbai attacks||Tahawwur Rana, a Pakistani-origin Canadian sent to US jail for his role in planning the 2008 Mumbai attacks, has been arrested after being freed from prison to face extradition to India.Rana, 59, a known close associate of David Coleman Headley - one of the main conspirators behind the attacks on India’s financial hub that killed 166 people - was serving a 14-year sentence in a Los Angeles federal prison when he was granted an early release last week because of poor health and being infected by the coronavirus.However, he never got out of prison as he was arrested to face extradition to India, US prosecutors told the Associated Press. Indian officials said they had learnt Rana was rearrested on June 10.Officials familiar with developments said a US attorney informed the district judge in Los Angeles about India’s standing request on Rana’s extradition who is wanted in India for terror charges.Also read: Arms-laden Pak drone shot down by BSF along International Border in J&K’s KathuaA senior National Investigation Agency (NIA) officer, who didn’t want to be named, said “It’s a positive development after over 11 years. This means his extradition hearings will now take place”.Former home secretary GK Pillai, who played a key role in the investigation of the Mumbai attacks and coordinated with the US, said there was a pending Indian extradition request for Rana.“There is a standing Indian extradition request for Rana and that will still be applicable,” he told HT.An NIA team that visited the US in late 2018 was informed by the department of justice (DoJ) that it was convinced with India’s charges against Rana.India’s had requested Rana’s extradition on charges of forgery and criminal breach of trust as he used his firm for making documents that were used by Headley during his surveillance missions in Mumbai. These charges were accepted by US prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and they are inclined to honour India’s request.Rana, a former Pakistan Army physician-turned-businessman, had been convicted by a court in Chicago in 2011 of providing material support to the Lashkar-e-Taiba for the Mumbai attacks, and for backing a planned attack on a Danish newspaper that printed caricatures of Prophet Mohammed in 2005. Headley was linked to both incidents and was convicted during the same trial.At the time, US reports had said American prosecutors had failed to prove that Rana directly supported the attacks in Mumbai and he was cleared of this more serious charge by the jury at the trial in Chicago.Rana’s legal team had claimed he had been misled by Headley, who was Rana’s friend from high school. Rana had been accused of allowing Headley to open a branch of his Chicago-based immigration law firm in Mumbai to act as a front for Headley’s surveillance activities in India’s financial hub ahead of the devastating attacks that also injured hundreds.He was also accused of allowing Headley to pose as a representative of the same firm when he went to Denmark for surveillance ahead of the planned attack.At the time, US prosecutors had said Rana knew Headley had trained with the LeT and that Headley had shared information with Rana of his surveillance activities in Mumbai and of the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, where LeT members later killed dozens of people.Headley was sentenced to 35 years in prison but can’t be extradited to India under a plea deal. Indian investigators have been allowed to question him.Pakistani authorities had arrested seven men, including LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, for the Mumbai attacks though their trial in an anti-terrorism court never made any headway. Lakhvi was subsequently released on bail and his current whereabouts aren’t known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-origin-plotter-tahawwur-rana-behind-26-11-mumbai-attacks-arrested-faces-extradition/story-JAd01AdFnQyfZT3QWztbnO.html
20-06-2020||India||Pakistan-origin Canadian rearrested in US on India’s extradition request for role in 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks||Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana has been rearrested in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people were killed, according to the US prosecutors. Rana, 59, was recently released from jail on compassionate ground after he told a US court that he has tested positive for the Covid-19. He was rearrested in Los Angeles on June 10 following an extradition request by India, where he is a declared fugitive, they said. Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian told the court that the Indian government, as per the bilateral Extradition Treaty signed in 1997, has requested the arrest and detention of Rana with a view towards his extradition. Lulejian said India has informed the United States that Rana is being prosecuted for a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, in violation of Sections 120B and 302, and murder in violation of Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Rana has also been charged with conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating and conspiracy to use as genuine a forged document or electronic record. He made an initial court appearance on June 11. On Friday, US District Judge Jacqueline Chooljian in the US District Court, Central District of California, scheduled his bond hearing for June 30. His attorney has been asked to submit his plea by June 22 and the federal government’s response is due by June 26. Lulejian said that the offences for which Rana’s arrest warrant was issued are covered by Article 2 of the India-US Extradition Treaty. An arrest warrant was issued against Rana in India by Poonam A Bamba, District and Sessions Judge, Special Court of India’s premier investigation agency National Investigation Agency (NIA), on August 28, 2018. According to the federal prosecutors, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana conspired with his childhood friend David Coleman Headley, also known as “Daood Gilani”, and others located in Pakistan to assist Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US-designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks. Rana was first arrested in Chicago on October 18, 2009. Thereafter he went to trial in the US District court for the Northern District of Illinois where Headley testified for prosecution. The jury convicted him of one count of Conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism in Denmark, and one count of providing material support to LeT. The jury, however, acquitted Rana of one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism in India. Harry D Leinenweber, US District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sentenced Rana to a 168-month prison term. On May 7 this year, Rana filed a motion for compassionate release in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In his motion, Rana claimed that he has tested positive for the Covid-19, and his precarious medical conditions put him at the extreme risk of life-threatening complications. Rana also asked the court to reduce his sentence and allow him to return to Canada. Rana is a Canadian citizen, but he was a residence of Chicago and running a business in the city at the time of his arrest. His petition was rejected by Rebecca R Pallmeyer, Chief US District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois on May 18. He filed a second petition -- Renewed Motion for Compassionate Release -– on June 4. Five days later on June 9, Judge Leinenweber granted Rana’s motion, reduced his sentence to time served and ordered his immediate release, while leaving intact all other aspects of his criminal conviction. Rana was serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island in San Pedro, California. Given that he is a Canadian citizen, the Department of Homeland Security has filed an immigration detainer for him with the Bureau of Prisons. He was formally rearrested the very next day on June 10. The Bureau of Prisons is currently holding Rana at that facility pursuant to the immigration detainer. Luiejian told the court in his submission dated June 10 that a formal request for extradition from the Indian government, supported by the documents specified in the Treaty, will be presented and finalised within the time required under the Treaty. The 2008 Mumbai attack was one of India’s most horrific terrorist attacks in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem in Mumbai on November 26, 2008. Pakistani national Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, was hanged to death on November 21, 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-origin-canadian-rearrested-in-us-on-india-s-extradition-request-for-role-in-26-11-mumbai-terror-attacks/story-tmpFhu3SIS8iZrWW7ZXXLI.html
20-06-2020||India||‘Rise above petty politics’: Amit Shah hits back after Rahul Gandhi’s Ladakh remark||Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday tweeted a video of the father of an Indian Army soldier, who was injured in the violent face-off with Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, to criticise Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his allegations against the government.Amit Shah’s tweet came after the former Congress president posted a video on Friday of the father talking about the attack on Indian soldiers along the contested areas of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Twenty soldiers, including a commanding officer of the 16th Bihar Regiment, were killed in Galwan valley on Monday night after the skirmish with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Many others were injured as well.After that Rahul Gandhi again attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday over his remark that neither has anyone entered Indian territory, nor is anyone present in Indian territory currently, and nor is any Indian post captured, alleging that the PM has “surrendered” Indian territory to Chinese aggression.“A brave armyman’s father speaks and he has a very clear message for Mr. Rahul Gandhi,” Shah tweeted.“At a time when the entire nation is united, Mr. Rahul Gandhi should also rise above petty politics and stand in solidarity with national interest,” he said. It’s sad to see senior GOI ministers reduced to lying in order to protect the PM.Don’t insult our martyrs with your lies.#BJPBetraysOurJawans pic.twitter.com/uwrmj1oxq1The father of the injured soldier, who fought in Galwan Valley scrap, also asked the Congress leader to “not to indulge in politics.”“The Indian Army is a strong army and can defeat China. Rahul Gandhi don’t indulge in politics in this… My son fought in the army and will continue fighting in the army,” he said, in a video tweeted by news agency ANI.Rahul Gandhi has been attacking the government over the face-off between the Indian and Chinese soldiers in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.“It’s now crystal clear that: 1. The Chinese attack in Galwan was pre-planned; 2. GOI was fast asleep and denied the problem; 3. The price was paid by our martyred Jawans,” Gandhi said on Twitter on Friday.The Congress leader also attached a news report about Union minister Shripad Naik saying that the June 15 attack was “pre-planned by China”. Congress president Sonia Gandhi had also asked if there was an intelligence failure on the build-up along the line of actual control (LAC) and sought an assurance from the government that status quo ante will be restored at LAC and China will revert to its original position.She also raised several questions about the situation along the LAC at an all-party meeting called by the Prime Minister to discuss the border stand-off with China.Indian and Chinese soldiers engaged in their first deadly conflict in at least 45 years at Patrol Point 14 in Galwan Valley, resulting in 20 deaths on the Indian side, including that of a commanding officer during the nearly seven-hour clash that also involved hand-to-hand fighting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rise-above-petty-politics-amit-shah-hits-back-after-rahul-gandhi-s-ladakh-remark/story-3zGP1eRdb5w7DaFp12EjyI.html

While two jawans had died by suicide till February.The state government has recently launched the “Spandan Campaign” in its bid to lessen incidents of suicides and fratricides among the stressed law enforcement employees, especially those deployed in the Maoist-hit Bastar region. “The primary reasons behind suicide among the state’s police personnel are depression, difficulty in getting their leaves sanctioned, and homesickness. Our records show that over 50% of these suicides occurred due to personal or family reasons, illness (11%), work-related dispute (8%), and other reasons (13%),” said an Indian Police Service (IPS) officer.Last December, six Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) personnel died at their camp in Narayanpur district because of fratricidal killings.

The programme aims to ban the open grazing of stray cattle after the sowing season is over,” said an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) official. A press release, issued on Friday, stated that the state government is aware that many villages in the state do not have cowsheds and cattle owners are likely to face major difficulties because of the ban on grazing to save Kharif crops.The government has come to the cattle owners’ rescue and is building 5,000 cowsheds across the state under the Suraaji Gaon Yojana. While 2,200 cowsheds have already been constructed, the work is in progress for another 2,800.The government has appealed to all sarpanches to ensure cattle remain in cowsheds when the ban on open grazing is in force, the release added.“An order has been issued, which states that if any cattle are found to be loitering in any civic area, then the municipal commissioner/chief municipal officer will be held responsible,” said a state government official.‘Roka-Chheka’ also aims to use organic manure by collecting cow dung from cowsheds.“The state government is creating new employment opportunities by building these cowsheds. Women self-help groups (SHGs) have been included in this programme. Members of SHGs will make goods and artifacts using cow dung, which can fetch them an additional profit. Diyas, or lamps, incense sticks made by women SHGs using cow dung were well received and did brisk business during the Diwali season in Delhi last year,” the release stated.The government also said that it has generated employment for around 25 lakh villagers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Rural Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced nationwide lockdown restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-govt-launches-roka-chheka-abhiyan-to-save-kharif-crops-from-open-grazing/story-l8qNGbAYAovOtGWXigKxHP.html

The patrolling party of the BSF found the drone flying in the Rathua area of Hiranagar sector in Kathua, Jammu And Kashmir and shot it down. The drone fell into a field. “The Pakistani drone was flying inside Indian territory in Rathua area in Hiranagar sector around 5.10 am when a BSF patrol shot it down,“ said a police officer at Kathua police control room.Inspector General, BSF Jammu Frontier NS Jamwal said, “The BSF has shot down a drone from Pakistan near Kathua and recovered among others M-4 US-made semi-automatic rifle, 60 rounds in it, two magazines and seven M67 grenades”.Also read: Chinese action in Galwan Valley unacceptable: IAF chief Bhadauria“It is a big development because the Pakistanis have adopted similar modus operandi of what they have been doing in Punjab,” he added.The six copter drone itself weighed around 17.5 kilograms and the consignment weighed around five to six kilograms, said Jamwal. “Surely, it was an attempt to deliver the arms and ammunition to someone here on this side. Who was he, remains a matter of investigation,” he said. The BSF IGP informed that the drone had a winch mechanism with which entire consignment had to be dropped to this side and it had to fly back to Pakistan. “This delivery was for some ‘Ali Bhai’ as the payload was carrying his name,” he said.Also read: No intrusion in our territory, army has free hand, says PMA senior police official said that the drone was 8 feet in wide blade-to-blade and seems to have been controlled by Pak picket opposite Panesar Post of BSF in Hiranagar sector. “Same weapons were recovered from Jaish-e-Mohammad militants who were killed after infiltration from Pakistan in an encounter at Ban toll plaza Nagrota while they were travelling in a truck to Kashmir some months back,” the official said.Pak rangers and Pakistani Army use such drones to see deployment of Indian forces and gaps to push terrorists into India. Hiranagar sector has always remained an infiltration route for Pakistani terrorists because of its terrain and three to four seasonal rivulets that flow into Pakistan. The development comes close on the heels of the Galwan Valley intrusion by Chinese troops where India lost 20 of its soldiers on June 15 that included commanding officer of Bihar Regiment, Colonel Santosh Babu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistani-drone-shot-down-by-bsf-along-international-border-in-jammu-and-kashmir-s-kathua/story-mNqGxQJQh8RZ6wvgeXksnM.html
20-06-2020||India||Fossils of stegodon elephant found in Saharanpur’s Shivalik range||A joint team of forest officials and wildlife organisation World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has claimed to have discovered fossil of a stegodon — a now-extinct elephant species known as Proboscideans — believed to be 5 to 8 million years old from Badshahi Bagh area of Shivalik range in Saharanpur district. The team, led by chief conservator of Saharanpur division VK Jain, was busy doing a trap camera survey for the counting of animals in the region recently when it came across the fossil. The team consisted of Jain, landscape coordinator, WWF, Dr IP Bopanna and senior programme officer Devvrat Panwar. Jain said after discovering a ‘strange object’ that looked like fossil, the team brought it to the forest office and decided to seek help of fossil experts. Dr RK Sehgal, a scientist at Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun, and its retired scientist Dr AC Nanda, both fossil experts, first examined it and then compared it with the specimens of stegodon displayed at the museum of the institute. They declared that the fossil could be 5 to 8 million years old. The presence of stegodons shows the existence of dense forests and lots of river channels in the area during that time. Other fossils which existed with stegodons’ were of those of giraffe, horses and hippopotamus.The discovered fossil was a moderately preserved third lower molar with nine well-developed ridges on its surface. The length of the molar is nearly 24 centimetre and the enamel of the molar is very thick. The sandstone embedded on the fossil is medium grained, salt and pepper in nature. This type of lithology is the characteristic of Middle Shivalik. Describing it as a great discovery, divisional commissioner, Saharanpur, Sanjay Kumar said, “It would pave the way for further study of fossils in the country, especially in Shivalik range because for the first time such an old fossil has been found here.”It the past, fossils of Stegodon had also been discovered from other locations of Shivalik groups like Kala Amb, Saketi, in Himachal Pradesh; Jammu foothills and Chandigarh. The existence of stegodons was also found in the foothills of Nepal and Pakistan. Stegodons existed 11.6 million years ago. There are unconfirmed records of their regional survival until 4,100 years ago. Fossils are found in Asian and African strata dating from the late Miocene. During the Pleistocene, they lived across large parts of Asia and Central Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fossils-of-stegodon-elephant-found-in-saharanpur-s-shivalik-range/story-a3YDohUmJqvcm5myrOZrwN.html

The gallant actions in a highly-challenging situation have demonstrated our resolve to protect India’s sovereignty at any cost,” Bhadauria said.Colonel Babu was the commander of the 16th Bihar regiment, who was killed along with 19 other men Galwan valley in Eastern Ladakh on Monday night.“It should be very clear that we are well prepared and suitably deployed to respond to any contingency. I assure the nation that we are determined to deliver and will never let the sacrifice of the braves of Galwan go in vain,” the IAF chief added.He made the comments during the Combined Graduation Parade (CGP) at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad.“The security scenario in our region mandates that our armed forces remain prepared and vigilant at all times. The development at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh is a small snapshot of what we are required to handle at short notice,” he said.“In spite of unacceptable Chinese action after agreements reached during military talks and resulting loss of lives, all efforts are underway to ensure that the current situation at LAC is resolved peacefully,” Bhadauria said.China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) killed 20 personnel of the Indian Army, including a Colonel, on June 15 in the Galwan Valley after the PLA did not follow through on a commitment to disengage as per an understanding reached between the two militaries on June 6. Indian military officials familiar with the sequence of the clash believe there were over 40 casualties on the Chinese side, including deaths and injuries. China has not officially given out numbers of casualties on its side.Tensions between India and China have increased after the June 15 Galwan skirmish that marked the first Indian casualties in a border clash with PLA troops since October 1975 when Chinese troops ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that neither has anyone entered Indian territory, nor is anyone present in Indian territory currently, and nor is any Indian post captured.“Neither has anyone entered our territory, nor is anyone still there, nor is any of our posts under anyone’s capture. In Ladakh, our 20 jawans got martyred. But they taught a lesson to those who were eyeing Indian territory,” PM Modi said at an all-party meeting called to discuss the India-China border situation.The PM had also praised the valour of the 20 army personnel killed in the clash and said they “taught a lesson” to those who were eyeing Indian territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-action-in-galwan-valley-unacceptable-efforts-underway-to-ensure-peaceful-resolution-iaf-chief-bhadauria/story-tU4LWyjrORnzXLXFEvZUjL.html

20-06-2020||India||Google, WhatsApp help reunite woman in her 90s with family after 43 years||Panchubai lived as Achchhan for more than four decades with the Khan family until she was reunited with her grandson this week.Israr Khan, with whom Panchubai lived all these years, and the residents of Kota Tala village in Damoh district came to know their Achchhan Mausi (aunt) was from Maharashtra just last month. Prithvi Kumar Shinde took his grandmother, who is in her early 90s, home on Thursday to Nagpur in Maharashtra. Khan could find her grandson with a little help from Google and WhatsApp. No one knows how Panchubai covered the distance of about 500km from a village in Amravati district in Maharashtra to Damoh in the Bundelkhand region. She was spotted by Khan’s father, a truck driver, on a road after she was attacked by a swarm of bees.“My father late Noor Khan saw her in pain while he was on his way home as many as 43 years back. He gave her some herbs for relief from the pain caused by stinging of bees,” Khan said. His father saw her again on the roadside a few days later and asked her about her whereabouts but she couldn’t say anything. He then brought her home. “Since then she became our Achchhan Mausi and that of the entire village, a name given by my father,” Khan, who works with a social organisation, said.“She used to utter Marathi words most often. My father and later myself and my friends tried hard to find her village but our efforts always hit a roadblock as we couldn’t get any clue from her or perhaps we failed to understand what she said,” he added.On May 4, during the lockdown, the Khan family was sitting together when she said something. Khan recorded what she said on his mobile phone and figured out that she mentioned Khanjam Nagar. “Later, I found a Khanjam Nagar panchayat in Amravati district. Through the help of Google, I could get the mobile phone number of a kiosk owner Abhishek in Khanjam Nagar. I had a talk with him and sought his help to circulate the photo of Mausi through WhatsApp in his village and around,” Khan said. “We jumped in joy when Abhishek told me that a family in the village identified Mausi as Panchubai and that she happened to be the grandmother of Prithvi Kumar Shinde who, however, resides in Nagpur with his family now,” he added.Shinde then contacted Khan. He told them that Panchubai lost her husband Tejpal in 2005 and son Bhailal three years ago.“My grandfather Tejpal and father Bhailal lost hopes of finding her having made frantic search several times. My grandfather had lodged a missing report too with the police station,” Shinde said.“I am happy that I am taking my grandmother home but sad too that my grandfather and father both passed away without seeing her and that she spent 40 years without us,” he added.Shinde said is thankful to the Khan family for taking care of his grandmother for 43 years.“However, I will always remain indebted to late Noor Khan and his son Israr Khan as this family not only gave shelter to my grandmother but also took care of her as its own member. If I am able to see my grandmother it’s because of Noor Khan and Israr Khan,” he added.Khan and his family couldn’t hold their tears when Panchubai left.“Since my childhood, I have been seeing Achchhan Mausi as my guardian. I have a mixed feeling. I am happy that she has ultimately got her family back but I am sad that I am losing our guardian.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-help-of-google-and-whatsapp-a-woman-in-her-90-s-reunited-with-family-after-43-years/story-PxipCJbS8yQTs5CRfjKtrN.html

They are not being able to draw pensions form banks on the Indian side in Uttarakhand since March due to the sealing of the border between the two countries, said an ex-serviceman.Several veteran ex-servicemen of Nepal who worked in the Indian Army, are living in the border areas of western Nepal. They draw their pension from Indian banks situated in Banbasa area of Champawat, Jhulaghat and Dharchula areas of Pithoragarh and Khatima area of US Nagar district in Uttarakhand.“These are the Nepalese citizens who joined the Indian Army previously through a certain quota for the Nepalese and are now living in border areas of Nepal. They still draw a pension from different Indian banks situated on this side of the border,” said Capt Bhani Chand (Retd), president, Gaurav Sainani Kalyan Samiti, Banbasa, Champawat.Also read: No intrusion in our territory, army has free hand, says PMThe Nepalese used to be recruited in the army under the Indo-Nepal treaty. They worked in the Indian Army and later returned to their native places after retirement. Several of them have been settled in Dehradun, Almora, Pithoragarh and different parts of Uttarakhand also.“Nepalese ex-servicemen are facing this problem along the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar border also. Nepalese ex-servicemen requested us to raise their problem so we are sending a memorandum to defence ministry of India,” said Capt Chand.“Around 700 Nepalese pensioners draw pension every month from our branch. Their pension is pending due to the sealing of India-Nepal border,” said Kamlesh Joshi, branch manager, state bank of India, Jhulaghat.The Nepalese are recruited in the army as per the Indo-Nepal treaty-1950. According to its provisions, the Nepal government allows its citizens to serve Indian Armed Forces and in return, India allows Nepalese to work anywhere in India in the private sector or government services (except for Indian administrative services).Pramod Bhatt, a businessman from Jhulaghat, said, “I have been watching Nepalese pensioners coming for their pension and purchasing household materials since childhood. They are not coming for the last three months due to the sealing of the international border.”Notably, international border is sealed since March due to Covid-19 outbreak. Entry points along the border were opened but only for migrants of both sides. No other person was allowed to cross the border during the lockdown, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepalese-pensioners-who-retired-from-indian-army-facing-financial-crunch-due-to-sealing-of-border/story-mpAaJyEJYb1y9E1Wvt9jyI.html

However, he said the country is hurt and angry by what Chinese forces have done.Before Modi's remarks, Gandhi raised several questions about the situation along the LAC. “In fact, even at this late stage, we are still in the dark about many crucial aspects of the crisis,” she said.The meeting was attended by leaders of 20 political parties. Apart from Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar; Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee; Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader K Chandrasekhar Rao; Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar; Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader MK Stalin;YSR Congress Party president YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray were among those who attended the meeting.Defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar were also present.While the Congress has repeatedly urged the government to be transparent about the border situation, Modi had earlier asserted that the sacrifice of Indian soldiers will not go in vain.“It’s now crystal clear that -- the Chinese attack in Galwan was pre-planned, the Government of India was fast asleep and denied the problem and the price was paid by our martyred Jawans (soldiers),” former Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted earlier in the day.He also tagged a report quoting minister of state for defence Shripad Naik, saying the attack was pre-planned by China and Indian forces will give a befitting reply.“We have some specific questions, for the government. On which date did the Chinese troops intrude into our territory in Ladakh? When did the government find out about the Chinese transgressions into our territory? Was it on May 5th, as reported, or earlier?” said Sonia Gandhi at the all-party meeting.“Does the government not receive, on a regular basis, satellite pictures of the borders of our country? Did our external intelligence agencies not report any unusual activity along the LAC? Did the military intelligence not alert the government about the intrusion and build-up of forces along the LAC, whether on the Chinese side or on the Indian side? In the government’s considered view, was there a failure of intelligence,” she further asked.It was for the first time since 1975 that India suffered combat fatalities in an incident involving Chinese troops during Monday night’s seven-hour clash in Galwan Valley. Also, 10 Indian soldiers detained by the Chinese were released after intense negotiations through diplomatic and military channels. China has so far not acknowledged any casualties among its troops.“The question is, what next? What is the way forward? The country would like an assurance that status quo ante would be restored and China will revert back to the original position on LAC,” the Congress chief said. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) reacted strongly for not being invited to the meeting.According to a government functionary, the criteria followed for sending invites to parties was -- all recognised national parties, those with over five MPs in the Lok Sabha, leading parties from the Northeast and parties with Union cabinet ministers.The Congress president said the all-party meeting should have come sooner and immediately after the government was reportedly informed about the Chinese intrusion on May 5, 2020 into several places in Ladakh .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-intelligence-failure-lead-to-lac-build-up-asks-sonia/story-4uuEMB4P9fwQCdnuSgSBaL.html

The guidelines continue to be effective, as on date, read a statement.As per the Ministry guidelines, very mild and pre-symptomatic Covid-19 patients can opt for home isolation provided the patient has a room to himself/herself with toilet facility and has an adult attendant /caregiver. Also, the patient shall agree to monitor his health and regularly inform the health status to the District Surveillance Officer for further follow up by the surveillance teams.“An important clause of the Revised Guidelines is that the treating doctor is satisfied about the patient opting for home isolation based on medical assessment and assessment of his/her residential accommodation. In addition, the patient shall fill in an undertaking on self-isolation and shall follow home quarantine guidelines,” the statement read.Also, all such cases of home isolation further shall be monitored by teams of well-oriented doctors on a regular basis, their discharge should follow the required guidelines and shall be reported as per norms.In this regard, the statement said that some instances have been noticed wherein home isolation is allowed in a routine manner in certain States, and clauses of the revised guidelines are not followed in letter and spirit.“This may lead to spread of the disease within the family members and neighbours, more so in urban settings such as dense urban agglomerations,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-centre-asks-states-to-follow-guidelines-for-effective-home-isolation/story-Jeo4smFdolaaLsOXdWddZL.html

The case was adjourned for July 7 after the central government requested additional time to file its response.The Supreme Court had earlier refused to stay the project when the matter had come up for hearing on April 30.The Central Vista houses iconic buildings like the Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhavan, the North and South Block buildings, which house important ministries, and the India Gate. The government is proposing to redevelop the Central Vista by constructing a new Parliament house, a residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice President, besides several new office buildings.The petitioners, advocate Rajeev Suri and retired Lt. Colonel Anuj Srivastava sought a direction from the court that no further work should take place on the ground (construction work) in furtherance of the project even if approvals are granted.

20-06-2020||India||Two brothers kill their kids, die by suicide in Gujarat||Two brothers from Ahmedabad city allegedly ended their lives after killing their four minor children, police said. All the six people were found hanging in a flat in a middle-class society in the city on Friday.Police said they were investigating whether the men took the step because of financial stress as a notice from bank to pay back loan amount was found pasted on a wall in the flat.“Preliminary probe reveals that the two brothers worked in different garment shops. On June 17, they left their respective homes after telling their wives that they were taking their kids for an outing. One of the brothers reached the unoccupied flat, where they used to live in the past, in a car along with his two children around 8.40 pm while the other brother reached around 10 pm on a scooter with his two children,” said Nipuna M Torawane, a joint commissioner of police (JCP) in Ahmedabad city. The flat belonged to the younger brother where both the men lived together with their families. However, they had shifted to separate houses six months ago. A half torn notice from a bank to pay the dues was found pasted outside the flat. The amount is yet to be verified,” the JCP said.When the police official was asked whether the deceased had killed themselves due to financial stress or if they were under the influence of black magic, as similar incidents had been reported in the past too, she said, “Different teams have been formed which are investigating the case from different angles. We are not ruling out any possibility. We are tracking their past, recording statements of their relatives and friends to reach a conclusion.”No suicide note has been recovered so far. The police official said when the two brother didn’t reach their respective homes for two days, their wives went to the flat which was found locked from inside. “When they found the house locked from inside, they informed the neighbours, local police and around 3am, the door was broken and the six were found hanging inside,” Torawane said.The police found the bodies of the two men in the drawing room, two girls in the kitchen and two 12-year-old boys in another bedroom. “The bodies must be over a day old as they had started decaying. We are yet to find the exact cause of death but four plastic tumblers have been recovered from the flat which indicates that the two brothers had given some drink to the kids...it could have been laced with sedatives...,” said Torawane.If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

They then agreed to register it in her son’s name but objected to her entry into their house. “However this week, the panchayat passed a diktat banning my entry into the village for the next 15 years. It has asked me to live at my parental home along with my son and daughter and allowed to rejoin my in-laws only after my son turns 18,” she said.Stating that the panchayat had done injustice with her, Devi added, “It is very difficult for me to live at my parental home for so long.”Sarpanch Sadhu Ram, when contacted, said the panchayat did pass an order to such effect.“We had called a panchayat after Devi and her in-laws were constantly engaging in domestic fights. Initially, the in-laws were accusing Devi of her husband’s death but later accepted their mistake. We have asked Devi to return to her in-laws’ house when her son attains the age of 18 years,” Ram said.Bhuna block development and panchayat officer Mahender Singh said the panchayat has done injustice to the widow and the sarpanch did not have any right to pass such a diktat.“We can take action only against the sarpanch. Rest of the investigation will be done by the police if the woman files an official complaint,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-village-panchayat-bans-entry-of-a-widow-for-15-years/story-vjCUFvSx9oGtmMj6LgV5SO.html
20-06-2020||India||Rs 50,000 crore, 116 districts, 6 states: PM Modi launches mega Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched a massive rural public works scheme, the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan, on Saturday to create jobs for millions of migrant workers who returned home during the coronavirus pandemic.PM Modi launched the scheme worth Rs 50,000 crore through video conference in presence of Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and deputy chief minister Sushil Kumar Modi. Chief ministers of other five states and Union ministers of concerned ministries participated in the virtual launch from Telihar village in Khagaria district of Bihar.Here is all about the Centre’s Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan:* The campaign of 125 days across 116 districts in six states aims to work in mission mode to help migrant workers.* The programme will cover 116 districts across Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha. All these districts have received more than 25,000 migrant workers during the lockdown.* It will involve intensified and focused implementation of 25 different types of works to provide jobs and create infrastructure in the rural regions of the country with a resource envelope of Rs 50,000 crore.* The programme, aimed at boosting livelihood opportunities in rural India, will “create durable infrastructure along with boosting employment opportunities,” an official communique said.* The scheme will be a coordinated effort between 12 different ministries or departments—rural development, panchayati raj, road transport and highways, mines, drinking water and sanitation, environment, railways, petroleum and natural gas, new and renewable energy, border roads, telecom and agriculture.* Rural development secretary NN Sinha said that the laying of fibre optics cable, railway works, rurban mission jobs, sanitation works, waste management, poultry, farm ponds and training through Krishi Vigyan Kendras will be given to the migrant workers under the programme.* Sinha also said that there is no bar for other districts to join the programme if they also have more than 25,000 migrant workers.* The Centre’s dependence on the construction to create jobs comes after skill mapping in districts where more than 25,000 migrant workers have returned, and run by the rural development ministry with monitoring by the PMO.* The government communique said the 116 districts will also contain 27 aspirational districts—India’s poorest areas in socio-economic indices—and the government hopes to cover about two-thirds of migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-50-000-crore-116-districts-6-states-pm-modi-to-launch-mega-garib-kalyan-rojgar-abhiyaan-today/story-fH5Vic7da0H8FkEmrq49dP.html

20-06-2020||India||India seeks to contain Chinese influence in UN||India will place efforts to contain Chinese attempts to expand its influence in the United Nations system as a foreign policy priority. New Delhi has always sought to reduce Beijing’s influence in the UN and its affiliated organisations, but it is now considering “all options” in its responses. Even the UN Human Rights Council, a tainted body that India has generally kept at arm’s length, may not be off the list.Previously indifferent to East River, over the past decade, China has come to see the UN as a means to legitimize its status as a great power. Its footprint has also grown because of United States hostility to the organisation. There at least four areas India will direct its diplomatic firepower.One will be to deny China chairmanship of UN agencies. Beijing holds four chairs presently and wants more such positions. India will, at the least, seek to ensure China does not win more positions and preferably lose some of the ones it already holds. The Chinese heads of the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Telecommunications Union are already in their second terms and seen as vulnerable. Indian officials say China sees four chairs as the absolute minimum it should have.A second line is to ensure no major UN offices or agencies are set up in China. Beijing has long been unhappy that no UN agency is based in their country despite being the world’s number two power. The present UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, has been trying to set up regional UN offices because of the high cost of operations in New York City. Last year, Beijing lobbied to have one such office set up in Shanghai. Besides land and housing, it even offered to pay part of the salaries of the UN staff. When China tried to mobilize the 140-strong Group of 77 countries to win support for the idea, India mobilized friendly governments from Africa to stall the plans. The US joined in at the Security Council level, citing security concerns about having UN offices on Chinese soil. While this drive has been derailed, Beijing will try again. “It’s still on the agenda,” says a former Indian UN diplomat.China also wants to take the helm in UN peace-keeping efforts. Beijing now contributes more to the peacekeeping fund than Britain, France and Russia combined. India has noted China is already pushing its soldiers to countries where its firms have economic interests. Chinese soldiers have performed miserably in South Sudan, but Beijing is more interested in giving the orders from the top.Finally, Beijing chafes at the fact it receives very few of the UN’s lucrative billion-dollar contracts for services and equipment. India, for example, is the second largest UN contractor thanks to its pharmaceutical products.China, say UN officials, “is nowhere on the list.” There is an expectation Beijing will try to get the rules of the UN’s tendering process diluted to its advantage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-seeks-to-contain-chinese-influence-in-un/story-sESzYEDpYK11MYOeIxslRM.html
20-06-2020||India||100 days of Covid-19: Forced to travel in the middle of a pandemic||Why travel when you can be home and safe? Ask the thousands of people who couldn’t think of anything else through India’s four lockdowns beginning March 25. Covid-19 has killed the idea of travelling for fun, but fun is not the only reason people travel. Sometimes, their lives depends on it — or work or relationships or refuge. That isn’t going to change, virus or no virus. Ashwini Chennuri needed to travel from Hyderabad to Visakhapatnam to be operated on; Shashank Tiwari from Mumbai to Hyderabad to be with his girlfriend; Geeta Patel from Chennai to Charlottesville because she wanted to be home; and Manmasih Banjo from Kottayam to Chaibasa because he was forced to go home after he lost the job. But how does one travel between cities, states and countries if buses, trains and flights won’t run? From March 25 to May 3, India barred buses and trains from running except to carry essential supplies; flights, domestic and international, too remained grounded until May. Ashwini Chennuri hitched a ride with a mango truck. On April 25, Chennuri, a Hyderabad resident who works for a short-video app, felt a sharp pain in his lower stomach. “I had been suffering from pancreatitis,” he said. “The doctor told me to get an operation. I could have gone to a hospital in the city but I couldn’t afford the charges.” “A shopkeeper told me that if I wanted, I could sit in the truck his cousin was due to drive from Hyderabad to Visakhapatnam carrying mangoes.” So, Chennuri travelled 500 km sitting beside mangoes, and dropped off across the state border in time for his operation. “I was fit to drive back after a day of bed rest, but I didn’t have the permission. You could only apply for a border pass if you were transporting something,” he said.This time, Chennuri walked up to the highway and waited for a lift. “I was in some pain, but I didn’t have an option.” After some time, a cattle truck rolled by. “I asked the driver how much he would charge to ferry me, and he quoted Rs 2000. I climbed in.” The cows were noisy, but Chennuri sat glued to his spot for the next 12 hours. “I had to get out of the truck at all the four checkpoints and walk for a bit until the truck caught up with me. If I hadn’t, I would have been sent to a quarantine facility by the border police.” A month later, Shashank Tiwari stood with his suitcase on a road in Goregaon, Mumbai, waiting under a drizzle for a vehicle, any vehicle, that would take him to the airport. On May 24, as India was under lockdown 4, air travel reopened, and Tiwari, who works for a radio station, booked one of the first flights out. “The number of cases in Mumbai were multiplying and I was worried about falling sick. Also, I wanted to be with my girlfriend who lives in Hyderabad,” he said. It wasn’t an easy decision, however. “At every step after I left the house, I felt I was fighting a battle. Sitting in the auto rickshaw to the airport, I worried about the number of people who must have sat in it before me,” he said. He hadn’t yet anticipated what awaited him at the airport.“At the entry, a guard examined my ID card and the Arogya Setu [tracking] app from behind a glass pane. Every part of the process was free of [human] contact. I printed my boarding pass and luggage tag, tied the tag around the luggage handle, and checked it in myself. It was all fine except that I had totally forgotten about a scheduled office conference call on zoom. My phone rang just as I was placing my bag on the luggage belt. I had to join the call,” said Tiwari who has been working from home since the first lockdown. So, he proceeded towards the security area holding his mobile phone in front of his face and his colleagues’ voices booming out from the speakers. “At the security, too, you have to do everything yourself. You don’t realise how long everything takes if you are wearing gloves. Even taking out the wallet from my back pocket took forever, and I could only use one hand, because the other was still holding the mobile phone on which the zoom call was in progress. I just hoped no one would ask me a question.” At the boarding gate, Tiwari was handed over a kit straight out of sci-fi. “It had a face mask, a face shield, and for those booked in middle seats, like myself, a white gown so large that five of me could fit into it. The shield comes down to your chin, and as you keep breathing through the mask, the space in front of your face fogs up. I couldn’t see properly with the shield on, and with the gown falling beyond my shoes, I couldn’t walk properly, either,” he said. Once out of the plane, Tiwari left the airport as fast as he could. “I wonder how long we can we can fly like this!” he said.Stuck in Chennai, a city she was visiting when the first lockdown kicked in, Geeta Patel spent a few seconds every day staring at flying planes. “I felt like a little child,” said Patel, currently a professor at the University of Virginia who had come to India in January on a Fullbright-Nehru research fellowship. On March 10, Patel, an American citizen and an OCI card holder, flew to Chennai from Delhi for research. In a week, she was supposed to return, and proceed to Boston for a conference. “But then Janta Curfew happened, and I thought it best to postpone my flight,” she said. In April, when the US ran repatriation flights, the pandemic was spreading fast and Patel didn’t want to take a risk flying. “On those flights, they weren’t giving out masks or ordering social distancing. If I got on, I would end up very very sick,” she said. In early May, the American embassy in India alerted her to a new series of repatriation flights, and Patel entered a paperwork spiral that she describes as “Kafka on Covid.” “On every new page, you are asked a lot of questions that you don’t know how to answer,” she said. After days of phone calls with the airline customer care, Patel got a seat on a flight leaving Bengaluru for New York via Paris. To board the flight, she needed to fill out more forms. The information demanded of her was obscure. “The names of the mother and father of the driver who would take me from Chennai to the Bengaluru airport, the relevant taluka and police station for every check point we would encounter, the registration number for my mother’s house in Noida,” she said. She almost gave up while filling out an excel sheet as part of securing border permissions (to pass every checkpoint in Tamil Nadu until its border with Karnataka; to cross over; to enter the airport; and get on the plane) that took 18 hours to complete. She realised her form kept getting rejected because she had a left a full stop where it didn’t belong. On May 20, Patel boarded the plane to Paris. A connecting flight to New York and two domestic flights later, she posted a Facebook update beginning with two magical words: “Finally home.” For many travellers in the coming months, home won’t be the last stop. After a three-day train ride from Kottayam in Kerala to Jasidih in Jharkhand, Manmasih Banjo has to spend another 10 days at a quarantine facility before he can go home to Chaibasa. Just a month after Banjo arrived in Kottayam to start working at a furniture factory, the first lockdown was announced and his workplace closed up. Stuck in a village over 2000 km from home. “Trains weren’t going out of Kerala. Some groups of migrant workers were able to book private buses, but it cost a lot of money,” he said. In the weeks after the first lockdown, thousands of migrant workers started for their homes on foot, but his home being thousands of kilometers away, Banjo waited. On 1 May, reacting to the struggles of migrant workers of whom many had died on their journeys, the Indian Railways initiated a series of special trains to take them home. Banjo registered for a seat. “I went to the local police office and filled out a form meant for migrant workers from Jharkhand. Nearly a month passed before I got a message saying a train was available. We went to the village office, paid Rs 900 and booked a trip. They gave us a receipt and asked us to go the village hospital for a medical checkup. After the checkup, the hospital gave us a token each that we needed to show to board a bus that took us to the railway station. At the station, we were given mask, sanitiser, food and water, and told to board the train while keeping our distance from each other,” he said. When Banjo finally reaches home, he would like to find work nearby. If that doesn’t work out, he would leave to earn a living again. The next time, though, he said, he won’t be sharing a berth with another man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-days-of-covid-19-forced-to-travel-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic/story-JGJgWQm8xp8hF2K3f5R7lN.html
20-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||I don’t know whether you received that WhatsApp forward about the time traveller who lands up in 2020.“Which year is this?” she asks someone.“2020.”“Ah, the first year of the quarantine.”If time travel were really possible — like pandemics, they are a recurring theme in dystopian fiction; some even successfully combine both — and if a traveller from the future were to arrive in 2020, it may help us answer questions about the coronavirus disease that we are still wrestling with.They could be really basic: like, do we find a cure? Or, how long does this last?Or, they could be morbid: like, how many people die?Or, they could be scientific. For instance, does being infected give one immunity? And if so, for how long?It turns out, according to a study published on Thursday in the journal Nature Medicine, that asymptomatic people may produce antibodies that can fight the viral disease for just a few months. The study is based on a small group, but its finding is worrying because it suggests that unlike a few other diseases, where being infected once gives a person lifelong immunity (chicken pox is an example), contracting the coronavirus disease once doesn’t mean a person will not contract it again. To be sure, it also does not mean that they will contract it again — even a trace presence of antibodies may be enough to fight off the disease, and the immune systems of these asymptomatic people might be better primed to face the Sars-CoV2 virus for the second time.So what does it mean? In the words of the authors, this might have “implications for immunity strategy and serological surveys”.Their reference is to the thinking in many countries that widely administered antibody tests can be used to identify who is immune and who isn’t, with the former being allowed to return to work, or travel. Now it emerges — caveat: this study is based on a very small sample — that some asymptomatic infected people might not test for these antibodies (and that they may or may not be immune).With so-called immunity passports being ruled out — for both ethical reasons and scientific ones — everything on the discovery and availability of a vaccine for the coronavirus disease. There are many promising candidates in various stages of testing and trial, and we could have a vaccine by next year. But it won’t be widely available immediately. The world will need seven billion doses (and if it is similar to flu shots, we may have to take one every year) and not everyone will get it. Issues related to ownership, funding, distribution, and prioritisation will need to be worked out. But according to a recent Bloomberg article, there could be a bigger problem with the first vaccines: they may not prevent the coronavirus disease.Citing Robin Shattock, a professor at Imperial College London — apart from its models that have informed debates on the spread of the pandemic, the institution is also working on a vaccine — the article said that researchers may settle for vaccines that prevent severe disease instead of looking for the perfect one that offers protection from the infection.“Is that protection against infection?” Shattock said. “Is it protection against illness? Is it protection against severe disease? It’s quite possible a vaccine that only protects against severe disease would be very useful,” he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.So, antibody tests can’t really tell if someone is immune and the first vaccines will only offer protection from severe disease, not infection.Clearly, this is one difficult virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-NuDekdyvSdzlMh1eFNY8xJ.html
20-06-2020||India||NDA gains Rajya Sabha ground, BJP bags 11 of 24 seats||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) gained crucial ground in the Rajya Sabha on Friday, winning eight of the 19 seats across eight states that went to polls in the first major electoral exercise since the outbreak of Covid-19. The party has earlier won three seats unopposed.Former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia of the BJP, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh and former Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren were among the heavyweights who emerged victorious on Friday even as high drama unfolded in Gujarat and Manipur, where the counting of votes began late amidst allegations of irregularities.Also read: 1,000 leaders clad in safety gear cast votes for Rajya Sabha seatsThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which had 90 members in the Rajya Sabha, has taken its tally to 101 in the 245-member Upper House, where the majority mark is 123. This is for the first time that the NDA tally in the Upper House has breached 100. The BJP alone will have 86 seats. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) will have 65 seats.The NDA, if backed by parties such as the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), can breach the halfway mark in the Upper House, and will be in a position to push key legislations in Parliament. It has an overwhelming majority in the Lok Sabha. Elections to 24 seats in 10 states were initially scheduled for March 26, but they were deferred as India clamped a lockdown to stop the spread of the disease around that time. From the original list, four candidates in Karnataka, including former prime minister HD Devegowda, and one in Arunachal Pradesh were elected unopposed. Polling was held in the remaining seats on Friday. Altogether, the BJP won 11 of the 24 seats.Personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand sanitizer were in supply in polling booths on Friday, and social distancing norms followed with nearly 1,000 legislators taking part in the polling process in the shadow of the pandemic.In Gujarat, the ruling BJP won three seats (Narhari Amin, Abhay Bharadwaj and Ramilaben Bara) and the Congress one (Shaktisinh Gohil). The resignation of eight MLAs since March denied the Congress a chance to bag the second seat. The declaration of the result was delayed after the Congress demanded that the Election Commission (EC) invalidate two BJP votes on different grounds. The Congress objected to Bhupendrasinh Chudasama casting his vote on the ground that his election was annulled by the Gujarat high court in May. The Supreme Court has stayed that order. The party also red-flagged Kesrisinh Solanki’s vote, saying an unauthorised person accompanied him inside the booth.A senior official, however, said the EC observer rejected the Congress’s objections and referred the matter to the poll watchdog’s Delhi office for final decision.In Manipur, the lone Rajya Sabha seat went to poll in the backdrop of an ongoing power tussle between the ruling BJP and the Congress. Fifty-two of the 59 members of the legislative assembly exercised their franchise with the BJP’s Sanajaoba Leishemba, the titular king of Manipur, securing 28 votes to defeat the Congress’s T Mangibabu, who got 24 votes. Though polling in the north-eastern state ended at 4pm, the counting of votes began around 8:30pm. The delay was attributed to the Congress’s complaints about irregularities during the voting process.In other states, results were along the expected lines with the ruling Congress foiling the BJP’s bid to such snatch an extra seat in Rajasthan. In the desert state, KC Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi of the Congress were declared winners. So was Rajendra Gehlot of the BJP. Also read: JMM’s Shibu Soren and BJP’s Deepak Prakash win Rajya Sabha polls from JharkhandThe BJP fielded a second candidate, but he lost. Congress insiders praised deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot for winning two seats in the face of the BJP onslaught.Scindia, who joined the BJP in March, sailed through in Madhya Pradesh and will make his debut in the Upper House. His party colleague, Sumer Singh Solanki, too registered a win. Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh retained his seat. In Jharkhand, former chief minister Soren and the BJP’s Deepak Prakash won the two seats. K Vanlalvena, a candidate of BJP ally Mizo National Front (MNF), bagged the lone seat in Mizoram, while the National People’s Party’s (NPP) WR Kharlukhi won in Meghalaya. The lone BJP MLA in Mizoram did not turn up to vote for ally MNF.In Andhra Pradesh, the ruling YSR Congress Party’s Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose, Mopidevi Venkata Ramana, Parimal Nathwani and Ayodhya Rami Reddy swept the four seats up for grabs.Altogether 61 seats in the Rajya Sabha were filled this year with 43 first-timers being elected and 12 members getting re-elected. Apart from Scindia, other prominent first-timers included Mallikarjun Kharge and KC Venugopal of the Congress, and M Thambidurai of the AIADMK, among others.After the vacancies arose in March across 20 states, 42 members were elected unopposed, including 28 first-timers. “While the 61 retiring members have a total experience of 95 terms ranging from one to four terms in the Rajya Sabha, the winners come with a total experience of only 32 terms, resulting in a decline in total experience of 63 terms,” a Rajya Sabha official said.Some of the 12 members who were re-elected included Bhubaneswar Kalita, a former Congress parliamentarian who switched sides to the BJP; Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar; and Union minister Ramdas Athawale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nda-gains-rs-ground-bjp-bags-11-of-24-seats/story-lGuALCtB4Z9wLT0qC11oFL.html
20-06-2020||India||No intrusion in our territory, army has free hand, says PM||In the wake of the killing of 20 Indian Army soldiers by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley and amid reports of Chinese forces intruding across the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Prime Minister Narendra Modi categorically said on Friday that neither has anyone entered Indian territory, nor is anyone present in Indian territory currently, and nor is any Indian post captured.The PM also praised the valour of the 20 army personnel killed in the clash, and said they “taught a lesson” to those who were eyeing Indian territory.While highlighting the capability of India’s armed forces and suggesting they have been given a free hand, Modi said that with India upgrading its border infrastructure, its armed forces better equipped, and more frequent patrolling, India is able to better “monitor” developments at the LAC and “respond better”.“Neither has anyone entered our territory, nor is anyone still there, nor is any of our posts under anyone’s capture. In Ladakh, our 20 jawans got martyred. But they taught a lesson to those who were eyeing Indian territory,” he said at an all-party meeting called to discuss the India-China border situation.But the PM’s remarks led to some speculation about the exact status at the LAC, particularly the Galwan Valley, which China, in recent statements, has claimed is part of its sovereign territory. India has dismissed the Chinese claim of sovereignty over the Galwan valley.A ministry of external affairs (MEA) statement on Wednesday said the Chinese sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on the Indian side of the LAC and took “pre-meditated and planned action” that resulted in the violence and casualties on June 15. The statement further said the Chinese intended to change the status quo on the ground in violation of all bilateral agreements not to do so.China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) killed 20 personnel of the Indian Army, including a Colonel, on June 15 in the Galwan valley after the PLA did not follow through on a commitment to disengage as per an understanding reached between the two militaries on June 6. While China has not officially given out numbers of casualties on its side, Indian military officials familiar with the sequence of the clash believe there were over 40 casualties on the Chinese side, including deaths and injuries. This was the first incident of bloodshed on the India-China border since 1975 and has led to an escalation of the ongoing conflict at the border in eastern Ladakh.Friday’s all-party meeting to discuss the fallout of the incident was attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader K Chandrasekhar Rao, Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader MK Stalin, YSR Congress Party’s YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray .Even as all political parties expressed their solidarity with the government and the armed forces in the wake of the ongoing confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi questioned the government about a possible intelligence failure, suggested that the country had been kept in dark about developments, and demanded the restoration of status quo ante at the LAC.In his remarks at the end of the meeting, according to an official statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office, Modi said that the entire country was “hurt and angry” at China’s steps at the LAC, but emphasised that the armed forces were doing all that they needed to do protect the country. “Be it deployment, action or counter action, through land, sea or air, our forces are taking the necessary steps to protect the country... Indian forces are capable of moving together across sectors.” He said that while the army had been given the freedom to take necessary steps, India had also conveyed its position through diplomatic means.The PM also said that the government had given primacy to development of border area infrastructure; it had also provided fighter planes, modern helicopters, missile defence systems and other needs of the armed forces; and patrolling capacity at LAC had also increased. “We are better informed about the developments at LAC and consequently are able to monitor and respond better. The movement of those which used to take place without any disruption earlier is now checked by our jawans, which, at times, leads to build up of tension,” he said, according to the official statement.External affairs minister S Jaishankar made a presentation at the meeting, which conveyed the stance taken by the ministry and included a summation of the engagements through diplomatic and other channels with the Chinese side to de-escalate and to disengage, people familiar with development said. According to the official statement, he also gave an overview of agreements between India and China on border management, informed about the directions given by the PM in 2014 to accord highest priority to the development of infrastructure in border areas in the regions identified and approved by the government back in 1999.Commenting on the PM’s comments on the incursion, Commodre (retired) C Uday Bhaskar, director of the Society for Policy Studies, said: “PM Modi’s s statement that nobody has entered Indian territory may be ‘legally’ accurate but it is disingenuous. It is contrary to the MEA’s assertion about a premeditated attack by the PLA and will baffle a nation that is shocked and enraged at the manner in which 20 army personnel have lost their lives.”Bhaskar added that while the sensitivity of the LAC violence must be recognised, there was a “growing sense, accompanied with dismay” that the country was not being told the full truth about the Galwan setback.Two retired army officials, who asked not to be named, also expressed their surprise.A former army commander, who asked not to be named, said: “If the PLA has not breached the LAC and come into our areas, what is the dialogue at the military and diplomatic level for? The people of the country must be made aware of the reality along the border.”A second retired officer said on condition of anonymity that China was trying to change status quo along the border. “We have to assert our claims forcefully. Many soldiers have died guarding these frontiers. We must never forget that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-intrusion-in-our-territory-army-has-free-hand-says-pm/story-vnD4uvqlLkL3E9I46Sg2cJ.html
20-06-2020||India||1,000 leaders clad in safety gear cast votes for Rajya Sabha seats||An Election Commission (EC) official first heard about the term personal protective equipment (PPE), the clothing, face shields, goggles, etc used for the prevention of infections, in March when it entered the popular lexicon amid the worsening Covid-19 pandemic. Even then, he thought it was solely for doctors and others involved in tacking the disease. Little did the official know that a few months later he would find himself in a PPE suit conducting a Rajya Sabha election in Madhya Pradesh on Friday. “For about 45 minutes, when the only Covid-19 positive legislator came to vote, all the polling officials were in PPE suits, like the MLA [member of legislative assembly],” the official said. “It took some of us nearly as long to put the suits on. ” The legislator was brought for voting in an ambulance that was sanitised multiple times. To further reduce the risk of transmission, all fans and coolers were switched off at the polling booth when he voted. PPE suits and ambulances were part of EC’s guidelines for conducting the elections to vacant Rajya Sabha seats across eight states. This was the first major voting exercise since the pandemic prompted sweeping measures in March to ensure social distancing to check its spread. The polls were earlier scheduled for March.Nearly 1,000 legislators participated in the polling in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Rajasthan. Meghalaya’s chief electoral officer, F R Kharkongor, called the election challenging and added they revisited their entire rulebook and re-evaluated the procedure. “But after a few hiccups, we managed fine.”Another EC official in the state said a coughing legislator sent them into a tizzy for a few seconds. “But once the doctor examined the legislator, we realised it was because the legislator choked on something...”The official said the people in their part of the country always greet each with handshakes but this time all they saw were namastes as the lawmakers sought to ensure social distancing. In Andhra Pradesh, a poll official said entourages that normally accompany the chief minister and senior ministers when they come to vote were subdued.The official said guidelines were sent to all legislators that also said they should travel to the polling venue with as few people as possible. The legislators in Andhra wore colourful masks as they turned out to vote. “Some were even wearing their party symbol on their masks,” the official said. “Unlike previous elections, the mood was somber. Electors came, voted, and left almost immediately.”Andhra Pradesh’s chief electoral officer, K Vijayanand, said no one took off their masks, even as they voted and a majority were wearing gloves.The Madhya Pradesh official cited above said the atmosphere was more “businesslike”. “Normally there is a lot of chit chat. Legislators hang around after they are done and gossip for hours, but this time, everyone kept their distance, voted, and left...”A poll official in Gujarat said the discharge and an end to the quarantine period of three lawmakers tested Covid-19 positive helped smoothen the election process.Gujarat’s additional chief electoral officer, Ashok Manek, said everyone was careful and maintained social distancing norms. “Extra care was taken and everyone was screened at the entrance of the [polling venue].” The election was “smooth sailing”, said Rajasthan’s top poll official Anand Kumar. “...[We] were extra cautious. But all in all, it went off pretty well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-000-leaders-clad-in-safety-gear-cast-votes-for-rs-seats/story-YUtQ3gwx7rRHsViNY4bY0I.html
20-06-2020||India||BJP wins two seats in MP, Scindia enters Upper House||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sumer Singh Solanki and Digvijaya Singh of the Congress were elected to Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh on Friday. The polling for the three seats was scheduled to be held on March 26, but it was deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Scindia, a former Union minister, got 56, Solanki 55, and Digvijaya 57 votes. Congress’s Phool Singh Baraiya, who contested unsuccessfully, managed just 36 votes. A candidate needed 52 votes to win. Two votes were rejected during the polling. In a video message posted on Twitter, Scindia thanked BJP’s leaders and lawmakers. “Given the responsibility bestowed on me with my election to Rajya Sabha from my home state, I will work with all my capabilities for the progress and development of Madhya Pradesh along with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, under the guidance of BJP national president JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah.”Scindia, a four-time Lok Sabha member, joined the BJP in March when the resignations of 22 Congress brought down chief minister Kamal Nath’s government. The BJP returned to power in the state after 15 months in March.It will be the second consecutive Rajya Sabha term for Digvijaya Singh, who is a former Madhya Pradesh chief minister. Addressing Congress workers Digvijaya Singh said, “I am grateful to the party leadership, state Congress president Kamal Nath, all the party MLAs, and other leaders and workers for their faith in and support to me. Now, we have to work for the party’s prospects in the by-polls to 24 state assembly seats. We all have to fight against the BJP under the leadership of Kamal Nath.”Solanki is a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh functionary from Madhya Pradesh’s Nima region. He will be serving as a Rajya Sabha member for the first time.All 206 members of the Madhya Pradesh assembly voted. They included a Congress lawmaker, who has tested positive for Covid-19. He was last to vote on Friday. The BJP has a strength of 107 in the assembly while Congress has 92 members. There are four independent, two Bahujan Samaj Party and the lone Samajwadi Party (SP) lawmaker in the 230-member assembly. There are 24 seats vacant seats in the House.The SP expelled its lawmaker, Rajesh Shukla, for voting for the BJP.The polling started earlier at 9 am and ended at 4 pm. It was held with social distancing measures in place in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-wins-two-seats-in-mp-scindia-enters-upper-house/story-C3EERYn8FSnkl7GRjjnhzL.html
20-06-2020||India||Power balance shifts in Upper House||The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) bagged 11 of the 24 Rajya Sabha seats that went to the polls on Thursday, bringing the ruling coalition within striking distance of the majority mark in the 245 member-strong Upper House of Parliament and in a much better position to manoeuvre position to clear crucial bills.The ruling alliance now has 101 members in the Rajya Sabha. The Bharatiya Janata Party alone commands 86 seats – of which 11 were won on Thursday.With the help of parties such as the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu (9 seats), the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party in Andhra Pradesh (6), the Biju Janata Dal in Odisha (9), the Mizo National Front in Mizoram (1) and four nominated members, the NDA is in a position to breach the majority mark of 123 in the Upper House. These parties have backed the NDA on a number of key pieces of legislation in the past – for instance, during the passage of the controversial Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill that bifurcated the erstwhile border state into two Union territories last year.Four nominated members are also expected to back the ruling coalition. The opposition United Progressive Alliance has 65 members in the Upper House with the Congress having 44 seats.Among the big names who won were senior BJP leader and former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, former Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren, and former prime minister HD Devegowda.The numerical boost for the NDA that can now hope to breach the halfway mark with like-minded parties is significant as the Narendra Modi government has signalled its intent to roll out bold reforms to attract more investments in the post-Covid world order.The government has already asked the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DIPPT) to prepare a document to woo investors in China and according to officials involved in the process, major reforms that require parliamentary sanctions would be part of the new policy.The NDA’s numbers assume significance because the government faced a stiff challenge in the Upper House in its first term because it didn’t enjoy a majority. The government failed to push through some key bills, such as the land acquisition bill.But things started to change after Narendra Modi returned to power with a thumping majority in summer last year. The NDA now enjoys a massive majority in the Lok Sabha with 335 of the 543 seats.Soon after Modi was re-elected in May last year, cracks started appearing in Opposition unity. Bills to ban triple talaq, bifurcate Jammu & Kashmir into two Union territories and the resolution to effectively scrap Article 370 passed in the Upper House. The added strength of the coalition can also come handy to tackle any possible Opposition criticism for the government’s handling of the conflict between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh, the handling of the economy and the Covid pandemic. In the past few weeks, the Opposition has criticised the government, especially over the plight of migrant workers and the issue is likely to come up during the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament. The government has a long list of pending bills that it aims to push through quickly in Parliament. These include the two labour codes—industrial relations and social security— that are aimed to reform the labour market to woo investors. The government also is keen to clear the Personal Data Protection Bill, a contentious legislation that aims to deal with securing data of private people. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill and the surrogacy bill are in the pipeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/power-balance-shifts-in-upper-house/story-e5uO8XKtH36QiV9N3pbPmM.html
20-06-2020||India||‘State-backed’ hackers hit Australia govt, businesses||Australia is being targeted by a widespread cyber attack originating from a “state-based” actor, the country’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a press conference on Friday, giving details of what some expert said indicated a link to China. The attacks targeted the government, public services and private businesses, the PM said. In more details released by the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the cyber campaign –named ‘copy-paste compromises’ appeared to deploy techniques available publicly and exploited known flaws in some specific products and protocols. “This activity is targeting Australian organisations across a range of sectors, including all levels of government, industry, political organisations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure,” Morrison said, according to news agency AFP, adding: “we know it is a sophisticated state-based cyber-actor because of the scale and nature of the targeting and the tradecraft used.” While the Australian PM did not name any country, cyber security experts said the strongest suspicion fell on China. “Many states have good cyber capabilities, but there are very few states that have the capability at the scale the Prime Minister talked about, affecting so many industries. The ones that possibly could at that scale: Russian, US, UK, China. I don’t see any motivation for the first three -- they’ve either got a good relationship with us or have far higher priorities,” said Tom Uren, senior analyst at Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s (ASPI) International Cyber Policy Centre.“Australia has been on China’s radar for years, and they have previously compromised all of the industries that the PM mentioned,” he said in an interview over email. The analyst added that the present attack appeared to be for stealing information instead of causing disruption or destruction.The revelations in Australia come at a time when there have been concerns about cyber attacks from China targeting Indian digital infrastructure as a consequence of the escalation in hostilities between the two countries in Ladakh. HT reported on Thursday intelligence inputs that some attacks from China-based actors had been launched on Indian networks such as payment and ATM networks.“In a conflict, espionage for military advantage is a dead certainty, but I’m not sure that China would try to disrupt Indian operations with cyber capabilities unless the conflict really escalated,” Uren said.He added that an attack of the kind seen in Australia could impact several sectors with valuable information. According to news agency AFP, Australia’s public broadcaster ABC cited “senior sources” confirming that China was believed to be behind the attacks.Australia has in recent weeks enraged China by calling for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and by accusing China of fuelling a virus “infodemic” and engaging in economic “coercion”. China -- increasingly unwilling to tolerate criticism of its more aggressive foreign policies -- has warned its students and tourists against going to Australia, threatened more sanctions and sentenced an Australian citizen to death for drug trafficking.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-backed-hackers-hit-australia-govt-businesses/story-BiNUjI0Bblr8RRqzRKBYhI.html
20-06-2020||India||Chinese side makes fresh claim on Galwan Valley||A day after India rubbished China’s claim of sovereignty over Galwan Valley, at the heart of a tense border standoff between the two sides, Beijing on Friday claimed the region on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control and had been patrolled by its troops for “many years”.The claim was made in what was described as a “step by step account of the Galwan clash” by Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian that was posted on the Chinese embassy’s website shortly before midnight on Friday.China’s People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) western command had in a statement issued on Tuesday initially raised the issue, saying: “The sovereignty of the Galwan River Valley has always been ours.”Also Read: ‘Taught them a lesson’: PM Modi explains the big picture in stand-off with ChinaOn Thursday, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had dismissed the PLA’s claim as “exaggerated and untenable”.On Monday night, Indian and Chinese troops were involved in a seven-hour violent face-off in Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and at least 76 injured. Another 10 Indian soldiers held by the Chinese side were released on Thursday.The so-called “step by step account” by Zhao said: “The Galwan Valley is located on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control in the west section of the China-India boundary. For many years, the Chinese border troops have been patrolling and on duty in this region.”It further claimed that since April, Indian troops had “unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities at the LAC in the Galwan Valley”. China made representations and protests on multiple occasions but “India has gone even further to cross the LAC and make provocations”, Zhao said.Also Read: Ladakh isn’t South China Sea, will not allow status quo to change: OfficialZhao contended Indian troops crossed the LAC by night and trespassed into China’s territory on May 6 and then “built fortification and barricades, which impeded the patrol of Chinese border troops”.They deliberately made provocations in an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo of control and management. The Chinese border troops have been forced to take necessary measures to respond to the situation on the ground and strengthen management and control in the border areas.Referring to a meeting of senior Indian and Chinese military commanders held on June 6, Zhao said the two sides “reached consensus on easing the situation”. He claimed the Indian side “promised that they would not cross the estuary of the Galwan river to patrol and build facilities” and the two sides would discuss and decide the phased withdrawal of troops”.Zhao claimed that on June 15, Indian troops violated the agreement reached on June 6 and “once again crossed the Line of Actual Control for deliberate provocation…and even violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went there for negotiation, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties”.He reiterated various accusations levelled by the Chinese side in recent days about the violation of agreements.There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to Zhao’s account.A readout issued by the external affairs ministry after a phone conversation between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on June 17 had clearly accused Chinese troops of provoking the clash on June 15 by entering the Indian side of the LAC.The readout had said the Chinese side “sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on our side of the LAC”. It had added: “While this became a source of dispute, the Chinese side took pre-meditated and planned action that was directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties. It reflected an intent to change the facts on ground in violation of all our agreements to not change the status quo.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-side-makes-fresh-claim-on-galwan-valley/story-r3NGSr5emL8Y0YORgHcH2O.html
20-06-2020||India||Is China eyeing new world order?||Is China using the world’s preoccupation with the Covid-19 crisis to enlarge its position on several border disputes and target rivals that could have a say in shaping the post-pandemic global order? That’s a question now being debated by experts and analysts following a string of actions by China over the past few weeks and months.India-China border standoff:The most urgent of the crises is the tense weeks-old face-off between Indian and Chinese border troops in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that has sparked at least three clashes since early May, the latest being the violent brawl of June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.India has accused China of taking “premeditated and planned action” that reflected an intent to change the status quo on the LAC.Reasons advanced for China’s actions have ranged from anger over India’s beefing up of infrastructure along the strategic Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road and India’s decision last August to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and create the union territory of Ladakh, which Beijing has indicated had an impact on its territorial claims in the region. Experts have also pointed to China’s desire to protect its considerable investments in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a key part of which is located in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Australia cyber attack:The Australian government said on Friday it was dealing with a massive cyberattack targeting all levels of the administration, industry, education, essential services, critical infrastructure, and political organisations. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said a malicious and sophisticated “state-based cyber actor” was behind the attack, adding that “there are not a large number of state-based actors that can engage in this type of activity”.Though Morrison didn’t name any country, Australian experts and observers pointed the finger at China. Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told CNN there was a “95% chance that it is China who is responsible for this attack”.Australia has been vocal in recent months about an international investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and backed India’s calls for reforms of the World Health Organization for its initial handling of the crisis. China retaliated with tariffs on Australian exports, including barley and beef. India and Australia have also spoken about working together to shape the post-Covid world order.South China Sea:There has been no let-up in China’s activities to bolster its presence in the South China Sea, where it is embroiled in maritime boundary disputes with several countries, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. A Vietnamese vessel was rammed by a Chinese ship near Paracel Islands on June 10, months after another Vietnamese boat was sunk by China’s coast guard in the same area. Numerous Chinese vessels have been spotted near Thitu Island, controlled by the Philippines but claimed by China. Earlier this month, Filipino authorities launched work on critical infrastructure on Thitu, located just 24 km from an artificial island created by China and equipped with radars and missiles. Over the past two months, an exploration vessel operated by Malaysia’s state-run oil company Petronas has been harassed in the South China Sea by Chinese vessels.Of these three countries, Vietnam has often turned to India to back its position in the South China Sea. Last year, Chinese vessels repeatedly operated in areas close to the waters where state-owned ONGC Videsh is engaged in oil and gas production.Senkaku Islands:On Thursday, China set a new record of sorts by sending its vessels into waters off the Senkaku Islands for 66 consecutive days. The islands in the East China Sea are controlled by Tokyo but claimed by Beijing, and Chinese vessels have been spotted in Japan’s “contiguous zone” every day since April 14. The contiguous zone is the area beyond the territorial sea and extending up to 24 nautical miles from the baseline that a country can claim. Technically, the presence of the Chinese vessels is not an intrusion but Japan regards it as a provocation. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told the media on Wednesday the Senkaku islands are “unquestionably our territory historically and under international law” and that a protest had been lodged with China over the presence of the vessels. “We think it is extremely serious that these activities continue,” he said.Both Japan and India are part of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad, which was upgraded to the level of foreign ministers last September.Hong Kong:China has never been happy with the “one country, two systems” principle put in place for governing the special administrative region of Hong Kong when it was returned by the UK in 1997. After Hong Kong was roiled by protracted and widespread protests last year over the local administration’s efforts to push a bill that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China for trial, Beijing has moved amid the Covid-19 crisis to draft a new national security law for the region that analysts say will undermine the semi-autonomous region’s systems. The draft law, submitted to a standing committee of the National People’s Congress this week, covers secession, subversion of state power, terror activities, and foreign interference.India, in line with its long-standing policy of not speaking on the domestic and internal politics of China, has not publicly commented on last year’s protests or the new draft law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-orders-riot-gear-for-soldiers/story-qFpA5iJjXY50ZOoE8y4BbO.html
20-06-2020||India||Army orders riot gear for soldiers||New Delhi: The Indian Army has ordered body protective suits and batons for troops deployed along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, the focus of current tensions with China, to protect them from assaults by Chinese troops, two officers familiar with the development said on Friday.The Chinese troops have been using stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs to inflict serious injuries during border brawls. Twenty Indian soldiers, including a colonel, were killed in a seven-hour brawl in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on Monday night.The order for the suits – essentially light-weight riot gear –was placed with a Mumbai-based firm last month after scores of Indian soldiers, including a colonel, were injured in a separate clash with Chinese troops on the northern bank of Ladakh’s Pangong Lake on the night of May 5-6, said one of the two cited above.Indian and Chinese soldiers have been caught in a tense confrontation along the disputed border since rival patrols clashed near Pangong Lake last month.The soldiers along the LAC will get 500 sets of protective suits soon in the first instalment, said a second officer. The army has ordered a total of around 2,000 sets of protective suits and batons, he said.The tensions escalated significantly after the brutal clash between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley on June 15. Both sides suffered casualties. The Chinese soldiers employed the same modus operandi and attacked Indian troops with stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs.Two retired senior commanders that Hindustan Times spoke to said it was inappropriate to supply riot gear to soldiers as their role was not the same as policemen.The June 15 clash also left 76 Indian soldiers injured, including 18 seriously, officials said. All of them are now stable.Indian Army officials have said 43 Chinese were killed or seriously injured, citing radio intercepts and other intelligence. The Chinese fatal casualties reportedly include a colonel, but HT could not independently verify this.The Galwan Valley clash took the relationship between the two nuclear powers to an all-time low.It came on a day army delegations from India and China held talks at two locations along the LAC – brigadier-rank officers met in the Galwan Valley and colonel-rank officers in Hot Springs – as part of continuing efforts to de-escalate and disengage.According to an agreement on confidence-building measures along the LAC, signed by India and China in November 1996, both sides do not open fire or conduct blast operations within two kilometres of the de facto border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-orders-riot-gear-for-soldiers/story-smVKpbkLdbfldaPM8haxXO.html
20-06-2020||India||Army builds bridge over Galwan river||New Delhi: Indian Army engineers on Thursday completed a crucial 60-metre-long bridge over the Galwan river in eastern Ladakh -- at the heart of the conflict between India and China in the region -- despite hostile moves by the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) to stall the project, people familiar with the matter said.The Bailey bridge (a prefabricated bridge developed by the British during World War 2) will help consolidate India’s hold of the sensitive sector by allowing infantry to move across the cold mountain river and also protect the 255km road from Darbuk to Daulat Beg Oldie, the last military post just south of the Karakoram Pass, the officials cited above added on condition of anonymity.The construction of the strategic bridge, which replaces a footbridge on the Galwan River, was a key trigger for the aggressive maneuvers by PLA in eastern Ladakh over several weeks, before the Chinese army’s Western Theatre Command this month made an exaggerated claim to the entire Galwan Valley.“We did not stop work on this bridge through the stand-off and kept working despite the violent face-off on June 15,” a senior army officer said.A senior government official confirmed, on condition of anonymity, that the bridge was completed on Thursday even as tensions raged after the June 15 clash in which 20 Indian soldiers and some Chinese troops were killed. China watchers described this as a signal from India that the border infrastructure upgrade projects being executed by formation engineers and the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) will continue despite PLA’s attempts to stall them.The four-span bridge is located 3km east of the confluence of the Shyok and Galwan rivers, with the contested Patrol Point 14 a further 2km east of the new bridge. Patrol Point 14, which was the site of the June 15 clash, is close to the Y-junction where the Galwan rivulet joins the main river. An Indian army base camp, “120 km camp” is located at the confluence of the two rivers and next to the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road.Experts said the Chinese claim to the entire Galwan valley was an attempt to reduce the Indian claim line to the Shyok river; to allow PLA to overrun the DSDBO road in times of hostility and cut off Daulat Beg Oldie, and so that it can open another road to Pakistan via Murgo, the last Indian village before Daulat Beg Oldie.Indian security officials told HT last month that Chinese action in the area was to “dominate the region” and “deter India” from completing the DSDBO road, which, once fully metalled, would give India a major advantage in terms of access and military mobilisation. A key part of this was the construction of the new bridge.The bridge, built on concrete pillars, gives India a major advantage in terms of access and military mobilisation and is vital to the protection of Indian strategic interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-builds-bridge-over-galwan-river/story-eHjtuUJtfQP73chysMurlL.html
20-06-2020||India||IAF chief visits forward airbases||NEW DELHI: Two days after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a brutal clash with Chinese troops in Galwan Valley, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria made a low-key visit to Ladakh to review the Indian Air Force’s preparedness in the sensitive sector where the IAF is operating its fighter jets and new attack and heavy-lift helicopters, people familiar with the development said on Friday on condition of anonymity.Apart from Sukhoi-30s and upgraded MiG-29 fighter jets, the IAF is operating Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters --- both imported from the United States --- in the sector that has been the focus of current border tensions with China, said one of the persons cited above. The IAF chief visited the forward airbases --- Leh on Wednesday and Srinagar on Thursday --- at a time of increased Chinese military activity across the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) where Indian and Chinese troops have been caught in a tense confrontation for over seven weeks and efforts to de-escalate have failed.“In these times of heightened alert, the movement of air force assets is to be expected and hence basing of fighters and helicopters upfront is but normal and should not lead to any extreme deductions,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.The Chinese deployment in its so-called “depth areas” or areas within its side of the LAC includes more than 8,000 troops, tanks, artillery guns, fighter bombers, rocket forces and air defence radars. Satellite imagery has revealed a Chinese buildup in the Galwan Valley and fresh inputs also suggest heightened Chinese activity in the Finger Area (a cluster of strategic features) near Pangong Tso where new Chinese positions and observation posts have come up in the last six to seven weeks, said the second person cited above.“The Finger Area is sensitive and the armies need to disengage there,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations. He said both sides had hardened their positions along the LAC but talks were on to resolve the border row.Bhadauria visited the Ladakh sector at a time when the Indian armed forces are on the highest state of alert to deal with any threat to national security following the significant escalation of the border conflict with China.The Chinese PLA is fully deployed in Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) with air, artillery and missile support, and the PLA Air Force has activated its bases in both Xinjiang and TAR with fighter aircraft making a show of strength in Aksai Chin area, as reported by Hindustan Times on Friday.The army has strengthened its posture across the length of the LAC --- from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh --- where reinforcements have been sent and the IAF also has kept its contingency plans ready, the officials said.Tensions have surged between India and China after the June 15 Galwan skirmish that marked the first Indian casualties in a border clash with the People’s Liberation Army since October 1975 when Chinese troops ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-visits-forward-airbases/story-u1S7WgReb8HTnNQKaAFQDI.html
20-06-2020||India||Debriefing of 10 soldiers released by China begins||Intense negotiations through diplomatic and military channels, including three rounds of talks between senior Army officers, led to the release of 10 Indian soldiers detained by the Chinese side after the violent brawl on June 15 in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, people familiar with developments said on Friday on the condition of anonymity.The soldiers were being debriefed by senior officers at Leh, the headquarters of the Army’s 14 Corps, on the over 60 hours they spent in Chinese custody, said one of the persons cited above. “There’s a protocol for debriefing and that’s being followed,” he said.Another person said the 10 soldiers, including two majors and two captains, were returned to the Indian side on Thursday evening, three days after the violent face-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that left 20 Indian soldiers, including a colonel, dead.“The debriefing is critical. It will be a formatted military narration of what they went through in Chinese captivity. This will form the basis of what really happened during those three days and how was the military posturing and conduct of the people who detained them,” said Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd), a former army vice chief.The negotiations for their release were kept tightly under wraps due to concerns for the safety of the soldiers amid the heightened tensions between the two sides, said the first person cited above.There was no official word on the development. All that the Indian Army and the external affairs ministry said on Thursday was that no Indian soldiers were “missing in action”.“The release of the Indian soldiers reflects Chinese intent. It perhaps shows the Chinese want to de-escalate and disengage,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director-general of military operations.However, a top retired army commander, who did not want to be identified, said China had already achieved what it set out to achieve – gaining control over the Galwan Valley and the strategic feature Finger 4 near Pangong Tso Lake, where a significant Chinese buildup has taken place over the last six weeks.“The gesture of returning the soldiers is a message to the world that they [the Chinese] are not the aggressors and they have returned people who intruded into their territory,” he said.The release of the 10 soldiers figured in three rounds of talks between Indian and Chinese delegations, led by major generals, near Patrol Point 14 in the Galway Valley between Tuesday and Thursday. Major General Abhijit Bapat, commander of Karu-based 3 Infantry Division, and his Chinese counterpart met for the third time on Thursday.The meetings were part of ongoing military engagements to de-escalate the situation and to disengage on the disputed border. The two senior military officers have met seven times since the stand-off began in early May.The 10 soldiers were medically examined and found to be in good health, said the second person cited above.Monday night’s seven-hour brutal clash involving over 500 rival troops also marked the first time India has suffered combat fatalities in an incident involving Chinese troops since 1975.Following reports that an unspecified number of soldiers were unaccounted for after Monday night’s clash, the Army had on Thursday only said that none of its personnel were missing in action.“It is clarified that there are no Indian troops missing in action,” the army said in a statement. An army spokesperson had said the statement was in reference to an article published in The New York Times on Wednesday.Asked about the specific issue of the status of Indian soldiers after the clash on June 15, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly media briefing on Thursday: “This has been clarified by the army earlier today afternoon that there are no Indian troops missing in action.”China has so far not acknowledged any casualties while 76 Indian soldiers were also injured. The Army has said 43 Chinese were killed or seriously injured, citing radio intercepts and other intelligence. The Chinese fatal casualties reportedly include a colonel-ranked officer but HT could not independently verify this.India has attributed the clash of June 15 to Chinese forces crossing to the Indian side of the LAC and attempting to build a structure. It has also rejected China’s People’s Liberation Army’s claim of sovereignty over the Galwan Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/debriefing-of-10-soldiers-released-by-china-begins/story-XF40qIzathvpbHPNh1Ib4M.html
20-06-2020||India||Govt may standardise wages for private security||The Centre is considering bringing about nine million private security guards under the purview of Code on Wages, 2019, to ensure uniform minimum wages for them nationally, Union home ministry officials said. State governments currently regulate the private security sector and wages of guards differ from one state to another. Parliament passed the code last year to guarantee a minimum wage to hundreds of millions of workers and to have set standard wages nationally. The rules for the code are being framed. According to the code, minimum wages will no longer be based on employment but on geography and skills. The code seeks to ensure timely payment of minimum wages and offers legislative protection to over 500 million workers in the unorganised sector.In a video conference with over 250 CEOs of private security agencies from all over the country and Central Association of Private Security Industry (CAPSI) on Friday, home ministry officials assured the guards will be taken care of in terms of wages, bonus, timely payment of salaries, overtime and social security schemes. CAPSI chairman Kunwar Vikram Singh said the proposed move will have a positive impact on the security guards, who have worked very efficiently across all sectors. “The home ministry has appreciated the role of private security agencies/guards particularly in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic and noted the difficulties they face,” he said. The officials cited above said the ministry will soon release the amendments to the Private Security Agencies Regulation Act, which will create a new regime for ease to doing business for private security agencies. As per the new rules, security agencies are expected to be able to offer designations to the guards, etc. Applications for the licences are likely to be eased and digital payments are expected to be allowed to pay the fees for them. Around 9 million security guards are registered with over 23,000 private security agencies and they are deployed at government offices, retail outlets, malls, restaurants, movie theatres, residential complexes etc. In Delhi alone, there are around 375,000 security guards and around 350,000 in Gurugram, according to CAPSI data. MHA officials did not offer any further comments on the proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-standardise-wages-for-pvt-security/story-IsxOzzzTmpg5V4BToHrGHL.html
20-06-2020||India||Suspended J&K cop granted bail; to be in jail in NIA case||A Delhi court on Friday granted bail to suspended Jammu and Kashmir DSP Davinder Singh after the Delhi police failed to file charge sheet against him during the statutory period of 90 days in a conspiracy case. However, Singh continues to remain in the jail in the case probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in which he was arrested while ferrying two Hizb-ul-Mujahideen terrorists in a vehicle on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway early this year.Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana granted bail to Singh and another accused--Irfan Shafi Mir on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh with two sureties of like amount in the case that Delhi police had filed.In March, the Delhi police’s special cell(anti terror unit) filed a case against Singh, for alleged criminal conspiracy and activities against the interest of the country.“…considering the fact that despite the lapse of statutory time limit to complete investigation, charge sheet in the instant matter has not been filed till date, both the applicants/accused persons, namely Davinder Singh and Irfan Shafi Mir are entitled to be released on bail….,” the judge said in its order.The court’s order comes after both the accused moved a bail application through their counsel MS Khan stating that both Singh and Mir were arrested on March 14 and March 19 respectively and have been in custody since then.Advocate Khan told the court that the statutory period to file the charge sheet has also elapsed and hence his clients should be granted bail. He also contended that there is no evidence to connect the accused with any terrorist outfit or to show the existence of any conspiracy.Singh and Mir were booked by the Special Cell under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The police claimed the duo was training young people from Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab to carry out terrorist activities. The two were brought to Delhi to investigate whether there were plans to carry out terror activities in Delhi.Singh is also being investigated by the NIA after he was arrested on January 10 while ferrying two terrorists on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway.Davinder Singh was intercepted when he was travelling on the national highway to Jammu along with two Hizbul Mujahideen commanders Naveed Babu, Rafi Ahmed Rather. Singh, suspected of going rogue, was arrested under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, or UAPA, the anti-terror law.“Accused Davinder Singh continues to be in judicial custody in NIA case. We have adequate evidence against him and he will be chargesheeted in due course,” an NIA spokesperson said.During a search of the car, one AK-47 assault rifles, three pistols, five hand grenades, 174 live rounds of AK-47 and 36 live rounds of pistol ammunition and other incriminating material were recovered. After initial investigations by the Jammu and Kashmir Police, the case was taken over by NIA and several teams of the central agency have been questioning the suspended police officer in Jammu.A senior Delhi Police officer said on condition of anonymity that the special cell is in “no hurry to file a charge sheet just because there is a statutory time limit”.“We arrested him because we had inputs about his links. We worked on the information derived from him during interrogation and even made some arrests based on that. But we will file a charge sheet only when we have strong evidence against him that will stand in court,” said the officer.“The main terror charges against him continue to stand and he remains in jail,” the officer added.Reacting to Singh’s bail, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tweeted-- “We all want to ask “How did the government allow this to happen?”But the real question is “How do we as Indians allow the government to get away with this shameful non-performance?”( sic)To this, NIA replied on Twitter, “Delhi Police had arrested Davinder Singh in a separate case. He continues to be in judicial custody in NIA case. Investigation is in full swing in NIA case and a chargesheet will be filed against Davinder Singh and other accused persons in the first week of July, 2020.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspended-j-k-cop-granted-bail-to-be-in-jail-in-nia-case/story-8al1wLwop5WUWk2D9aMzqK.html

Also, there were allegations that migrants had to pay for their journey home. “We issued appropriate directions to all states (on June 9). All migrant workers have to be transported in 15 days,” the bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah said, reiterating its order through video conferencing. “Our order is very clear that no migrant worker has to pay for the ticket.” Senior advocate Gopal Shankaranaraynan, who appeared for the National Law Universities Alumni Association, told the court that members of his group were helping migrants stuck in Maharashtra to reach destinations in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. He alleged that there was lack of information on the trains.He complained that migrants were being asked to pay for tickets. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the Centre will make available trains within 24 hours of receiving a request. The court posted the matter on July 8 to monitor implementation of its directions.States and Union territories received a mandate on June 9 from the court to ensure the return of all workers stranded by the lockdown to their home states and to inform it about welfare programmes, including job opportunities, they plan to offer the returnees.The court also asked states and Union territories to identify migrant workers who have returned and prepare an inventory of the vocational skills they possess and their employment history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-june-24-deadline-to-send-migrants-home-sc-tells-states/story-i155sK4xLaeRL1ql3VeH1M.html
20-06-2020||India||Antiviral drug gets regulatory approval||Glenmark Pharmaceuticals on Thursday announced that it received approval from India’s drug regulator, the drugs controller general of India (DCGI), to manufacture and market the oral antiviral drug Favipiravir to treat mild to moderate Covid-19 cases in India. The drug will be marketed under the brand name ‘FabiFlu’.The drug is known to inhibit virus replication and in April, the company was the first to receive approval from the regulator to conduct clinical trials in the country.“This approval has been granted based on evaluation of data and in consultation with the Subject Expert Committee, as part of accelerated approval process, considering the emergency situation and unmet medical need of the Covid-19 outbreak. It is for restricted emergency use in India. Restricted use entails responsible medication use where every patient must have signed informed consent before treatment initiation,” said company in a statement.Favipiravir, sold under the brand name Avigan in Japan, is used to treat influenza in that country. What Glenmark is producing is a generic version of Avigan, the company had said in an earlier statement. In the past few months, post the outbreak of Covid-19, multiple clinical trials have been initiated on Covid-19 patients in China, Japan and in the US.“Having internally developed the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), and the formulations for the product, Glenmark filed the product for clinical trials with the DCGI and has received approval for conducting the trial on mild to moderate patients,” the company had said.The treatment duration is a maximum of 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antiviral-drug-gets-regulatory-approval/story-Wz1COgwYdUfdnTj6sgak9J.html
20-06-2020||India||Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai gear up for Covid-19 spikes||First, some projections. By the end of this month, going only by the rise in new cases since June 8, when Unlock 1.0 came into force, the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Mumbai would be 80,000; 100,000 in New Delhi and 71,000 in Chennai, which officials of all three metropolises agree, would greatly test their health infrastructure.The unlock guidelines, crucial to restart economic activities and prepare the country to learn to live with Covid-19, has led to a spurt in cases in most states. Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai however, account for more than half of the total cases in the country today. These cities are among the 65 most critical Covid-19 affected districts in the country, according to the latest analysis of the health ministry shared with state governments.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is handling Covid-19 cases in the Mumbai, estimates that if the same pace of increase continues, the business capital of the country will have around 80,000 cases by the end June and over 100,000 by mid July.Suresh Kakani, BMC’s additional municipal commissioner, said that the numbers have stabilised in the past month. But that doesn’t mean they’re not large enough to cause concern: in the past month, Mumbai has seen a daily addition of anywhere between 1,000 to 1,700 cases. [June 16 fell short of the lower end of that range by 19 cases.] “The numbers have stabilised for now, but we cannot estimate saturation point. We will have to wait for one more week,” he said. On Friday, Mumbai’s case count was 64,139 (1264 fresh cases), and 3425 deaths (114 new deaths). The mortality rate in the city was 5.33%. The BMC officials said assuming that 1,500 cases are reported in the city every day for another 12 days, the city will have 81,000 cases by June end. To cope with the increase in cases, the BMC has set up 90 clinics in areas where the concentration of cases is highest, such as Dharavi, Worli Koliwada, Mankhurd and Govandi, and also stepped up screening efforts in other areas by setting up additional 400 fever clinics. “We have conducted over 2.69 lakh tests, and are maintaining daily number of tests being conducted at 4,500 to 5,000. In the last one week, we have touched the 5,000-mark on June 12 and June 16. Our capacity is to conduct around 7,000-8,000 tests daily,” Kakani said.The high number cases doesn’t indicate that the city has reached its peak, experts said. Thus, the city must prepare for the eventuality that it hasn’t.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant said, “In the last one month capacity of the medical health infrastructure has doubled, and the cases have risen from around 15,000 to 60,000. We will have to scale up at a much faster rate, if we are of the belief that the peak in Mumbai has yet not arrived.” He added that the occupancy rate of the ICU beds and ventilators was above 90% on any given day. Chennai, by comparison, has fewer cases than Mumbai, but it accounts for 70% of the total cases in Tamil Nadu. The state government, on June 15, announced a complete lockdown starting Friday and till the end of the month in Chennai and three adjoining districts, Chengapattu, Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram. The lockdown was enforced after there was a steady rise in cases, an increase in deaths and lack of public cooperation in maintaining social distancing and wearing masks. After the first case was reported on March 24, by June 7 -- a day before Unlock 1.0 was to start -- Chennai had 22149 out of the state’s 31667 cases. Ten days later, Chennai breached the 35000-mark while Tamil Nadu crossed the 50000-mark. This month, the state has reported more than 1,000 new cases everyday with Chennai accounting for most of them. In the first week of May state-run Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University projected that Chennai would have roughly 71000 cases by June-end and 150,000 cases by the second week of July. However, this forecast may change with the imposition of the 12-day lockdown.“Rather than focussing all resources on 1 million people in the containment zones, the city now has to control its entire population of 8 million,” said a member of the task force constituted to recommend ways to control spread of Covid-19, who was not willing to be named.To deal with the increase in cases, Chennai has prepared a micro-level plan for each of 200 wards in the city with an assistant engineer in-charge at each ward. The Chennai municipal corporation is conducting door-to-door surveys for its 8.4 million population and has set up more than 400 fever camps and 10 mobile sample collection centres.“We need a maximum of 30,000-35,000 beds to manage our peak,” city corporation commissioner G Prakash had announced on June 7. He added that 20000 additional staff nurses and 2,000 paramedics were appointed in June for Chennai and its three neighbouring districts. There is no clear data of daily testing figures in Chennai, but it is roughly pegged at 5,000. According to the health bulletin released on June 19, 160,000 samples have been tested in the city so far. Tamil Nadu, which was testing around 18,000 samples a day has ramped up testing to 25,000 daily in the past three days alone. However, experts say that to assess and control the spread of the disease, Chennai alone needs to test at least 10,000 people per day. “We began easing lockdown norms since May but did not significantly ramp up testing in Chennai or plan an aggressive containment strategy to restrict the cases geographically,” said a member of the government-appointed medical expert panel quoted above. As of June 19, Tamil Nadu has tested 789, 408 individuals, which is 71,725 more than the people Maharashtra has tested and 60% more than Gujarat’s test numbers.“For this lockdown to be effective, we need aggressive testing and early isolation of people with symptoms and their contacts. If a person starting to show symptoms is isolated within 3 to 4 days, the transmission can be cut by half,” says Dr Prabhdeep Kaur, a member of the government appointed expert medical panel and deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology.In Delhi, the average daily increase of confirmed cases has grown by 9% against 6% daily average for the 11 days prior to Unlock 1.0. On June 9, the Delhi government had projected that the total Covid cases (including recoveries) would be around 1,00,007 by June 30 and 2,24,537 by July 15. Even though the fatality rate (the number of people who succumbed to the virus) is at 5.5% now, versus 3.7% prior to June 8, the recovery rate has improved from 27% to 49% in the 11-day period. Delhi is conducting more tests than before and as on June 19, it has conducted 15,400 tests per million with positivity rate of 31%, up from 7% on May 17.To cope with the anticipated increase in cases, the Delhi government plans to have 80,000 beds by end of July from the present 10,889. The government has identified 40 hotels (4,628 beds) and 77 banquet halls (11,229 beds) that are being turned into Covid care centres (to add 15,800 beds immediately), said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. In addition to this, the city government is planning to build the country’s biggest Covid Care Centre at a religious institute in South Delhi Bhati area, which will add 10,000 more beds in the city. Besides, 50 train coaches with 800 beds have also been readied by the northern railways for Delhi.Will these cities cope with the rise cases remains to be seen, but they are bracing for impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-mumbai-chennai-gear-up-for-covid-spikes/story-mHB16aAbB5tl5J99DwEabK.html
20-06-2020||India||Pride and patriotism prevail as Galwan Valley clash martyrs are laid to rest||More than gloom it was a sense of pride and patriotism that prevailed among the people who had gathered in large numbers to watch the family members perform the last rites of martyred sepoy Rajesh Orang at Belgoria village in south Bengal’s Birbhum district on Friday.26-year-old Orang, was among the 20 soldiers killed in a violent face-off with Chinese troops along the undefined Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. Bipul Roy from Alipurduar district in north Bengal was also martyred in the same incident. The Army cortege arrived from the Panagarh military hospital, where the body of Orang was kept for the night after a military aircraft brought his Tri-colour draped body from Leh via Chandigarh on Thursday evening.Army personnel carried the coffin to Orang’s home around 9 am, where his family members –father Subhash Orang, mother Mamata Orang and sister Shakuntala Orang - broke down into tears.“We are all proud of him. Given a chance I want to join the Indian Army and avenge his death,” said Abhijit Orang, his cousin. The two had spoken over the phone two weeks before Rajesh was killed.Villagers started shouting patriotic slogans – Bharat mata ki jai, Vande Mataram and Jai Hind - and showered petals as army personnel arrived with Orang’s coffin on their shoulders. People from all across the district had gathered at the otherwise nondescript village of Belgroia from where Orang hailed.“I have come from Dubrajpur which is around 30 km away. I just wanted to get a glimpse of the martyred soldier. I don’t belong to his village. But still I am feeling proud,” said Paresh Bauri, who had come all the way on his bicycle to witness the proceedings.Rajesh’s body was buried in a field at the entrance of the village after a gun salute by the army. Villagers claimed that there are proposals to rename the village after Rajesh Orang. Leader of political parties, including MPs and MLAs, also could be spotted at the occasion.In north Bengal’s Alipurduar district, the mortal remains of martyr Sepoy Bipul Roy was expected to reach the Bindipara village around 4 pm. Thousands of people thronged on both sides of the road leading to the village to pay their last respect. His body was kept at Hasimara air base after it was brought at 9.30 pm Thursday. Bakul Roy, younger brother of Bipul said: “Though I have lost my brother, I want peace to be restored between China and India.“I get scared every time I think about the future of my sister-in-law and niece,” Bakul who works as a daily wage labour in Bhutan said.Bipul Roy’s last rites were completed in his native village in Alipurduar district around 9:30 pm on Friday. Meanwhile, as a mark of protest, Chinese goods were thrown out and set on fire in places like Bagdogra near Siliguri. Protests also erupted in other parts of the state where small groups of people were seen burning effigies of the Chinese President Xi Jinping and raising slogans calling for a boycott of Chinese goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pride-and-patriotism-prevail-as-galwan-valley-clash-martyrs-are-laid-to-rest/story-DPm6M2cd0e4n3E1JdSs42N.html
20-06-2020||India||Former PM Deve Gowda urges political leaders to tone down nationalist rhetoric||Former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader Deve Gowda who has recently been re-elected to the Rajya Sabha, on Friday, issued a statement asking for toning down of nationalist rhetoric. Saying that this was not the time for using language of provocation and revenge, he said that media outlets spreading fake information and cheap rhetoric endanger the lives of our soldiers and diplomatic staff.The letter released to the public also asked the opposition parties not to use intemperate language, saying that this was an hour for co-operation. Interestingly Gowda’s statement came on a day when the PM convened an all-party meeting to discuss the Indo-China border standoff. Stating that there is a feeling among our fellow citizens that we are engulfed by hostile nations, he urged the political leadership to ensure that such anxiety is quelled with proper information. He said that a senior serving military officer and a diplomat should make a detailed presentation to opposition leaders on the ground situation. He stated that the demand was not for classified details but truthful information.Criticizing what he said were efforts in recent times to politicise the armed forces, he said that this was a dangerous move and added that it should be allowed to remain a professional force. Urging the government not to encourage reactionary language of economic boycott, the implications of which were deep, he said that the country should be guided by pragmatism. Gowda did not attend the PM’s meet of opposition leaders, as he was not invited, said his office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-pm-deve-gowda-urges-political-leaders-to-tone-down-nationalist-rhetoric/story-mPth6KT7jHDr2tVmpwJshI.html

20-06-2020||India||Rs 50,000-crore public works on the cards for generating jobs||Public works worth Rs 50,000 crore will be offered in a dedicated programme to be launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this month to create jobs for millions of migrant workers who returned home, the government announced on Thursday.The programme, titled Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan, will start from Bihar on June 20 via video conference and the “focused campaign” will run in “mission mode” for 125 days across 116 districts in six states to help migrant workers get jobs, it added.The largest number of migrant workers (three million) have returned to Bihar since the Covid-19 pandemic swept through the country leaving daily-wage labourers jobless in big cities.Watch | PM Modi launches Rs 50,000 crore-scheme to create jobs for migrants “In 125 days, nearly 25 schemes will be brought together to reach saturation. These will include Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, Gram Sadak Yojna, Jal Jeevan Yojna, PM Gram Sadak Yojna, etc,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a press conference on Thursday.The move will not involve new budgetary allocation -- the 25 schemes will be front-loaded, utilising in 125 days the allocation meant for the year, said Sitharaman.Aimed to boosting livelihood opportunities in rural India, the programme will “create durable infrastructure along with boosting employment opportunities,” an official communique said. The Centre’s dependence on the construction to create jobs comes after skill mapping -- in districts where more than 25,000 migrant workers have returned, and run by the rural development ministry with monitoring by the PMO -- showed more than two-thirds of the migrant workers belonged to this sector, according to an official, who asked not to be named. The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan will start from Telihar village of Bihar’s Khagaria district. The programme will cover India’s 116 districts across Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha. All these districts have received more than 25,000 migrant workers during the lockdown. “We are pooling resources from these 25 projects. There are some works which may get affected by monsoon such as laying of roads. But we want to front load the money allotted for these for those 116 districts and ensure that all those workers in these districts are given employment,” said Sitharaman.Rural development secretary NN Sinha said that the laying of fibre optics cable, railway works, rurban mission jobs, sanitation works, waste management, poultry, farm ponds and training through Krishi Vogyan Kendras will be given to the migrant workers under the programme.He added that there is no bar for other districts to join the programme if they also have more than 25,000 migrant workers.The 116 districts will also contain 27 Aspirational Districts—India’s poorest areas in socio-economic indices—and the government hopes to cover about two-third of migrant workers, the government communique said. Twelve different ministries or departments-- rural development, panchayati raj, transport, mines, drinking water, environment, railways, petroleum, new & renewable energy, border Roads, telecom and agriculture — will participate in the programme, the release added. “Money has been pooled in together to start the programme. The priority is to provide immediate work for them as we go along; we have to see how it goes and if some people would like to stay or go back,” Sitharaman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-000-cr-public-works-on-the-cards-for-generating-jobs/story-BAmzE0l9VJMQmU8oRNTw7K.html
20-06-2020||India||This young rapper says being poor doesn’t mean you give up dreaming||One interesting consequence of Covid-19 is the birth of quarantine celebrities reaching out to us through their phones and computers. They talk about the lockdown life in a lighthearted way to cheer us up.One such celebrity is Vikas Bhagel. “Bahar na niklo, kyunki yeh gunah hoga, jo halke mein le rahe, unka haal toh suna hoga!,” he tells you in his viral rap video. This Delhi boy is a driver’s son who had no means to produce the video. With the help of his friends, he could shoot and edit it. If you can dream it, you can make it happen, even in the most adverse circumstances, he tells us.Vikas emphasises on the guidelines to follow to protect oneself against the virus in his video. He also brings up the plight of migrant workers and celebrates the unsung corona warriors such as doctors and nurses.The 21-year-old journalism student is a keen observer and wants to do his bit for the society. “Even if people forget about Covid-19, I hope this rap remind them about the lessons we learnt, the most important one being compassion,” he says. Vikas recorded this video at Loyal Studio, in Kondli in east Delhi. “We all have different ways of expressing ourselves. Some pick up the brush while some put their thoughts into lyrics. With some creativity, we can at least make a crisis bearable if we can’t immediately overcome it,” says the young rapper.Vikas bought a new Bluetooth speaker to make his parents listen to his rap. He says, “We didn’t have the resources to produce this video. I really didn’t know how to do it. But then God made it happen. The reaction of my parents was priceless,” he says.Vikas’ story is about will and determination. He says, “Poverty can be no excuse to give up dreaming. With hard work and a never-say-die attitude, you can achieve any goal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-young-rapper-says-being-poor-doesn-t-mean-you-give-up-dreaming/story-HXBwzZp5aNANlf9AHwaTHK.html
20-06-2020||India||Govt reviews use of HCQ and antibiotic combo in treating coronavirus cases||The Union health ministry is reviewing use of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), in combination with antibiotic azithromycin, for treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on patients in India, and is likely to come up with revised clinical management guidelines for this soon.According to people familiar with the matter in the health ministry, HCQ is likely to remain as a part of the treatment protocol but azithromycin could be dropped; instead a different combination of medicines that have been allowed for restricted use by the central drugs controller might be tried.“Health ministry has been reviewing the evidence in favour and against HCQ from all over the world. In the recent group of ministers’ meeting also ICMR presented its views on the medicines currently having shown promise in Covid treatment, including remdesivir and favipiravir. HCQ most likely is going to be continued for use but with probably a different combination. Ministry is looking into it and should soon take a call,” added one ministry official, who asked not to be identified. According to the health ministry’s current clinical management protocol for Covid, which was revised on March 31, HCQ in combination with azithromycin can be used for patients with severe disease and requiring intensive care unit (ICU) management. The recommended dosage for HCQ is 400mg twice a day for 1 day, followed by 200mg twice a day for 4 days, and for azithromycin the ministry has recommended 500 mg once a day for 5 days.The combination, however, is not recommended for children under the age of 12 years, pregnant and lactating women.“Since there was no other therapeutic option available after combination of antivirals originally in use for HIV/AIDS lopinavir–ritonavir was discontinued for use among Covid patients in March, this combination of HCQ and azithromycin is being given to severely ill patients currently in hospitals across the country on experimental basis. As other medicines have now shown promise against the virus it makes sense to review the evidence and revise the treatment protocol,” added the official.The jury is still out on HCQ. One international study says it doesn’t serve as a therapeutic or as a prophylactic after exposure to the infection. However, a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research suggests that it works as a prophylaxis pre-exposure. An expert working with the government says, “In situations like an outbreak, when you don’t have the luxury of conducting randomized clinical trials for paucity of time, you recommend a medicine after looking at whatever data is available globally. However, if a medicine is recommended then as per protocol, you need stronger evidence against it to withdraw its use. As of now the evidence is weak, and HCQ because of its safety and efficacy track record is our best bet that can be easily given even at grassroots level in primary health centres.”Doctors treating Covid patients afree that more data is required to reach a definite conclusion.“We need more research on HCQ to be able to tell conclusively whether it is working or not. Its use is not banned as of now,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care division, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-reviews-use-of-hcq-and-antibiotic-combo-in-covid-cases/story-LfIlmcn2qxiQvX87i7YIIJ.html
