UPSC postponed the exam from its original date of May 31 keeping in mind the fact that many candidates would be unable to reach their examination centres because of the lockdown caused by Covid-19 as well as the inability of states to host such a large-scale exercise.Nearly 1 million people register for the civil services preliminary examination every year and over 160,000 officials help conduct the exam across 2,500 centres for recruitment to the elite Indian Administrative Service and Indian Foreign Service and other services.“The fresh date will help students reach their exam centres on time,” an official in UPSC said on condition of anonymity. “ Other exams have also been scheduled keeping all the health factors and needs of both students and those conducting the exam in mind.” The Indian Forest Service preliminary exam will be held along with the UPSC preliminary. The National Defence Academy exam is scheduled for September 6 and the combined medical services examination is scheduled for October 22. B.S. Baswan, who led a panel on UPSC reforms, said the dates give UPSC sufficient time to put infrastructure in place for holding such a massive exam amid the coronavirus pandemic. “This will give the Commission time to get more invigilators and provide more space to ensure social distancing during the exam,” Baswan said. “They may also consider installing CCTV cameras. At the end of the day, conducting the exam will be a question of logistics.” According to an official at the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, who requested anonymity, training g typically starts at the end of August and lasts until the end of May. Then the officers head to their respective districts to work under the district collector. After that, they return to the institute for five weeks to submit their dissertations. The last week of training g is spent in London or South Korea, honing their skills. They also pass a variety of exams during the year-long period. It is only after this that they start as assistant secretaries or sub-divisional magistrates, said the official. “If the main examinations are being held in January, then that implies that another seven to ten months have been added to the calendar,” said Padamvir Singh, former director of the Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration, the apex training institute for the civil services. “That implies the training will not change much as they will reach the academy by October. At most, the foundation course will have to be curtailed by a few months. But overall it is a little change in the cycle.”Anil Swarup, a former government of India secretary and author of the book Not Just A Civil Servant, concurred with Singh. “They have no other option,” said Swarup. “They have actually offered more time to prepare. Normally, between the prelims and the mains, you get three-and-a-half months. This time, it is four-and-a-half months.”Swarup added that after the interview, the foundation course will start. “It normally begins in September, but this time it will be in October this year, it won’t deter the calendar by much.” According to Palak Gupta from Chandigarh, who will write the civil services exam for the first time, the dates will give students enough time to prepare for the examinations. “Everyone was expecting that the exam will be held in August, they have given more time,” said Gupta, 24. “Things would have opened up a bit by then. Moreover, there will be enough time to prepare for the main exam.”Gupta said there was one catch. “Students will now have to study current affairs a lot more,” she said. “An additional three months, as well as all that has followed the coronavirus crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/upsc-to-hold-prelims-on-oct-4-mains-in-jan/story-uMuyQ3rP8Q8wggR4mTC48N.html

With Friday’s figures, the state’s tally of Covid-19 cases has reached 4,835, including 3,088 active cases, 1,688 recoveries and 57 deaths.With the reporting of a sixth of all active Covid cases in the state on Friday, alarm bells were ringing in the state government, though a health department official claimed that the jump was primarily due to increased testing –13,627 on Friday – and due to arrivals from hotspots like Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu. “Otherwise, local transmission is negligible,” he claimed on the condition of anonymity.The Kalyan- Karnataka region-- the northernmost tip of Karnataka-- including Kalburgi, Yadigir, Raichuru districts have seen the maximum spurt in cases.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesCoastal Karnataka district of Udupi, which is home to a number of returnees working in Mumbai hotels, tops the state with 685 active cases. Kalburgi, with 417 active cases, Yadgir with 345 and Raichur -318 share the second, third and the fourth spots among districts with most number of active Covid cases in the state.However, the official quoted above pointed out that the Covid-19 death rate in the state was just “a tad bit over 1%” and a third of all positive patients registered have been cured and discharged.Primary and secondary education minister Suresh Kumar, who has been the main spokesperson for the government on Covid-19 matters, did not address the media for the fifth day in succession but chose to tweet, saying “Bangalore’s population is estimated at 1.2 crores. In the last two months till yesterday, (the number of) those who tested positive for Covid were mere 424, in other words, just 0.003%”. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Meanwhile, despite the sharp jump in cases, the state government decided to further relax the lockdown norms and issued an SOP extending transport operation in the state into the night. All state-run transport buses will now be allowed to ply even at night. Earlier, the state had declared curfew between 9 pm and 5 am everyday, in line with the central notification governing Unlock 1. It has also permitted cabs, autos and taxis to ferry passengers who have valid tickets to commute on these state-run transport buses at night.Leader of opposition (LoP) in the assembly, Siddaramiah also attacked the handling of the pandemic by the state government. Speaking to reporters in Mysore, Siddarimah said “The state government has been very lax in the way it has handled the ongoing pandemic and the resultant economic fallout in spite of opposition extending its full cooperation to the ruling establishment. They are neither responsible in the manner they have handled the pandemic, nor are responsive to the needs of people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-returnees-drive-biggest-single-day-rise-in-karnataka-covid-cases/story-dOkWpXhft0qvhgOBqaWAvM.html
05-06-2020||India||Goa won’t allow mass events at religious places to prevent Covid explosion||The Goa government will allow the reopening of malls and restaurants from Monday onwards but has barred mass prayers and gatherings at religious places, chief minister Pramod Sawant has said. “No functions can be held in religious places. We have said that if temples, churches and mosques open, then groups of people coming and performing prayers or aarti will not be allowed, it should be limited to routine pooja for individuals or individuals taking darshan,” Sawant said.The decision would mean that churches, temples and mosques cannot have large gatherings for pooja, Mass celebrations or community prayers, but private ‘darshan’ or private prayer within the premises of these churches would be allowed.Church authorities in Goa have said that they were not planning on throwing open the churches for the congregation and would only do so unless specifically permitted by the government. The central government has allowed for the reopening of religious places from June 8 onwards but social distancing is virtually impossible for holding Mass celebrations in churches.Resumption of Vaishno Devi yatra may take a while as shrine officials await SOPsCurrently all religious services involving participation of the public are not allowed; the priests are allowed to perform pooja individually within the temple and in churches, priests are allowed to celebrate Mass but without the participation of people. “We will not begin the celebration of Mass with the people unless the Goa government gives us guidance and the SOPs and until it is safe to do so. Safety is the key word,” Fr Joaquim Loiola Pereira, Secretary to the Archbishop of Goa has said. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesSeveral churches including the Archbishop of Goa have been streaming the religious services live for the benefit of their congregations. Despite the centre allowing the reopening of religious places, several persons have expressed apprehension that it would lead to these places becoming hotspots for community transmission. “Precautions have to be taken. Community transmissions should not happen. I will request the Archbishop to delay the opening of the church in Goa for the general public. It is because there is transmission happening,” Michael Lobo, minister in the Goa government said. “I feel the temple heads should also reconsider after what has happened in Vasco. We should not be the reason. I’m just saying where people can gather we have to curtail,” he said. The chief minister has also said that written orders which will detail the measures needed to be taken by restaurants and malls for reopening from June 8, will be issued soon. “From the 8th onwards, malls and restaurants have been allowed. We will issue the norms and the SOPs. We will allow them to reopen after following social distancing norms,” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-won-t-allow-mass-events-at-religious-places-to-prevent-covid-explosion/story-3hLWmc3j5SPXYyKMTOquBK.html

BJP has also announced a series of ‘virtual rallies’ concerning five parts of the state. The first such ‘rally’, to be attended by party workers using mobile applications and broadcast live on social media, would be addressed by union home minister Amit Shah on June 9.On Friday afternoon, while attending a government programme on world environment day, CM Banerjee took digs at the BJP for launching political campaign when the state was battling with the Covid-19 situation and the devastation caused by cyclone Amphan.“At a time we are fighting disasters, a political party is everyday calling for our removal from power. Is this the time for politics? Why, I am not calling for Narendra Modi’s removal from Delhi? That’s because we don’t consider this to be an appropriate time for politics. Go and serve the people, plant trees and clean ponds. You guys were hiding for three months at a ‘video corner’ of your home while we were working on the field,” Banerjee said.Also Read: We must work together to restore greenery devastated by cyclone Amphan: CM Mamata BanerjeeShe said Bengal will defeat, “the coronavirus, the disaster and the conspiracies”.Later, in the evening, she convened a meeting of the party, including its state and district-level leadership, over videoconferencing.“During the meeting she told us that the BJP has started its electoral campaign and that we, too, will have to work keeping the elections in mind. She said we have to effectively counter BJP’s propaganda and highlight the good work of our government in the past nine years,” said the president of a district unit of TMC who did not want to be named.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesBJP, which recently released a nine-point charge sheet against the Mamata Banerjee government, on Friday rubbished Banerjee’s allegations of playing politics in the times of a crisis.“She is playing politics. The ration and the relief system have been hijacked by the ruling party. Our party’s leaders were not allowed to carry out relief work. The police have been politicised and used to book our leaders in false cases. We have rightly called for the removal of an undemocratic, corrupt and anti-people government,” said BJP state unit president Dilip Ghosh(COPY ENDS)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-sharpens-attack-on-bjp-asks-party-to-prepare-for-the-2021-elections/story-pMEEbRHDCdJUdNeLBuSvON.html

Recently, Ladakh-based innovator and educationist Sonam Wangchuk had appealed to Indians to boycott Chinese products in the backdrop of the recent standoff between Indian and Chinese forces along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Wagchuk’s video from Ladakh drew over 20 lakh views in two days but he says that those should be converted into something concrete that would bite the Chinese government.He insisted the people’s “wallet power” could be an ideal supplement for the army’s capabilities to safeguard our borders in Ladakh.India’s trade deficit with China is massive at $56.77 billion. The bilateral trade between India and China was $93 billion last year after it fell by about $3 billion as both countries experienced economic slowdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-emotions-not-official-crpf-on-its-men-taking-oath-to-shun-china-goods/story-GqpdnQPv9tAuh4d1h4zlrO.html
05-06-2020||India||In historic departure, Snana Purnima held in Jagannath temple sans devotees||For the first time in the history of the 12th century Jagannath temple, the Snana Purnima festival was held without a single devotee entering the temple premises on Friday due to the government’s order to bar their entry in view of Covid-19 pandemic.With Covid-19 cases surging in Odisha by leaps and bounds, Snana Purnima of Lord Jagannath, the most important festival preceding the Rath Yatra, was held without the presence of a single devotee as the Puri district administration imposed section 144 of CrPC around the temple to prevent congregation of devotees.Chief administrator of Jagannath temple, Dr Krishan Kumar said around 800 temple priests were involved during Snana Purnima and all of them had undergone Covid-19 test to rule out any chances of spreading the infection. “This must be the first time in the history of the temple that the festival was held without the presence of devotees,” he said.Puri district collector Balwant Singh said in view of Covid-19, the government had decided to celebrate the ‘Snana Purnima’ festival with a limited number of servitors to ensure strict implementation of the guidelines. “Devotees were barred as it would have been impossible to adhere to social distancing norms with thousands of them converging in the temple. They however could see the rituals through live telecast on television,” he said.Also Read: Resumption of Vaishno Devi yatra may take a while as shrine officials await SOPsDIG of Police (Central Range) Asish Singh said 38 platoons of police force, each consisting of around 33 personnel, were deployed to prevent any untoward incident.As per the rituals of Snana Purnima, the three deities were taken out of the main temple soon after midnight in a procession by a select group of priests to the bathing pedestal called Snana Bedi inside the temple premises. The priests then poured 108 pitchers of aromatic waters mixed with turmeric, sandalwood and flowers on them amid chanting of hymns. While 33 pitchers of water were poured on Lord Balabhadra, it was 35 for Lord Jagannath, 22 for Devi Subhadra and 18 for Lord Sudarshan.After completion of the bathing ceremony, the deities were then decked up in ‘Sada Besha’ and later in the day they adorned Hati Besha (a form of Lord Ganesha). While Lord Jagannatha and Lord Balaram were dressed like elephants, Goddess Subhadra wears a lotus flower Besha. This year the devotees saw the Besha of deities on TV.Also Read: Tirumala temple opens for public on June 11, separate hour for VIP darshanWhile devotees could not enter the temple, Puri King Gajapati Maharaj Dibyasingha Deb, too, missed the ceremonial sweeping of Chhera Panhara. Dibyasingh Deb later said he decided to stay at home in compliance with the government’s Covid-19 guidelines, which bars persons over 65 years of age from venturing out. “I opted out as I am over the age prescribed by the government. This is the second time I missed doing the ceremonial sweeping,” he said. In his absence, his representative performed the ritual.The deities will fall sick after the ceremonial bath and recuperate inside the temple till they get well a day before the Rath Yatra.Rath Yatra is likely to be held on June 23 this year with government permission, but without the presence of a million plus devotees. Pending government permission, the temple management has started building the three chariots taking adequate precaution such as adhering to social distancing norms and testing all the carpenters for Covid-19.Puri king Gajapati Maharaj Dibya Singha Deb, the ceremonial first priest of Lord Jagannath, said that Rath Yatra can only be held if the state government ensures that no devotees are allowed into the Grand Road leading to the temple.“Rath Yatra can be possible in absence of devotees on the Grand Road with only officials, police and priests. Devotees can have darshan of the Rath Yatra in their homes through TV,” said Dibya Singha Deb. He added that the managing committee of the temple has decided to keep the temple closed for the public till the three deities return back to the temple, 9 days after the Rath Yatra.If no devotees would be allowed to congregate on the Grand Road, then the government may need at least 2000 policemen to pull the three chariots. Officials said that as observing social distancing norms would not be possible during pulling of chariots, all the policemen would need to be tested for Covid-19 and kept in isolation before the festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-historic-departure-snana-purnima-held-in-jagannath-temple-sans-devotees/story-bLdhKSd4LHjWQxffSSvAcP.html

Army officers of the two sides have held several meetings along the LAC but were unable to break the impasse.Both sides agreed that in accordance with the guidance provided by their leadership, they “should handle their differences through peaceful discussion bearing in mind the importance of respecting each other’s sensitivities, concerns and aspirations and not allow them to become disputes”, the external affairs ministry said in a brief statement without giving details.The two sides “recalled the consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, that peaceful, stable and balanced relations between India and China will be a positive factor for stability in the current global situation”.The officials of the two sides also exchanged views on the challenge posed by the Covid-19 pandemic and cooperation at different multilateral forums.India and China have been in touch through diplomatic and military channels in New Delhi and Beijing to address the border tensions. Joint secretary Srivastava has been involved in these contacts, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.The people also acknowledged Friday’s meeting was meant to set the stage for the meeting on June 6 between the general officer commanding of Leh-based 14 Corps, Lt Gen Harinder Singh, and his Chinese counterpart.The army commanders are meeting almost a month after tensions between India and China flared along the LAC, taking bilateral ties to a new low.India has dismissed China’s contention that its troops were hindering the activities of Chinese troops along the LAC and accused Chinese forces of hindering patrols on the Indian side. The Indian government has also made it clear that it won’t allow any change in the status quo along the LAC and that it will tackle the prevailing situation with “strength and restraint”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-hold-talks-at-highest-diplomatic-level-since-standoff-at-lac/story-WKn82u3mtojd1Bp0CRo2eP.html

The expert committee of the DGCA issued a clarification to the court that SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, could spread by an inadvertent touch only if a non-infected person touched a droplet from the sneeze or cough of an infected person.The panel clarified to a two-member HC division bench, comprising Justices SJ Kathawalla and SP Tavade, that a proper personal protective equipment (PPE) kit prevents the spread of the viral infection.It explained that the infection can spread, “if a surface such as a cloth is infected with Covid-19 virus (such infection will take place when a droplet from the mouth or nose – through sneezing or coughing -- of an infected person sits on such a surface) and a non-infected person touches it and then touches his mouth or nose, then there are chances that the second person may get infected. This is the reason why it is recommended that a person should disinfect his hands regularly.”It added, “If an infected person merely touches a non-infected person, the virus will not be transmitted unless the condition mentioned above are fulfilled. The transmission has to take place through the droplet carrying the virus sitting on clothes and ultimately these reaching the mouth, nose, or eyes of the other person.”Solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, while referring to the committee’s response, informed the court, “If an infected person is wearing a protective gown and a non-infected person is sitting next to him/her, even if the infected person’s clothes have the virus sitting on it, the protective gown would insulate this person and if the neighbouring person in inadvertently touches the gown, this person will not be infected as the gown would provide the necessary shield.”Carriers such as IndiGo, GoAir, SpiceJet and Air India have cited their inability to keep the middle seats on flights empty because of fliers’ high demand, but stated that they are taking all necessary precautionary measures such as providing PPE kits to all their passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ppe-prevents-spread-of-covid-19-dgca-expert-committee-to-hc-on-leaving-middle-seats-vacant/story-Ii0txXHsTpkNDgV9y8QC4O.html
05-06-2020||India||Kolkata’s containment zone area trimmed to give more people liberties||With restrictions being gradually eased during Unlock 1 phase, the area of Kolkata’s containment zones is shrinking as the city administration allows more relaxations for the residents.Earlier an entire campus or an apartment was tagged as a containment zone after any resident tested positive, but with the new rules coming in, only the tower in which the patient resides would be declared a containment zone.“In case there are multiple patients from the same campus and they reside in different blocks or towers, then the entire campus would be identified as a containment zone,” said Firhad Hakim, chairperson of the board of administrators that presently run the Kolkata Municipal Corporation. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesSimilar relaxations are also being allowed in slums that would result in containment of pockets therein instead of the entire slum area. Slums have common toilets and water sources.“Only those households that use the toilet or the water source used by the patient will now be identified as containment zones,” he added.More than one third of the Covid-19 cases in West Bengal have been reported from Kolkata. While West Bengal has registered a total of 6,876 cases, Kolkata has registered 2,488 of those. Out of 283 deaths caused by Coved-19, 182 have been reported from Kolkata alone. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The union government has recently stressed that the boundary of containment zones should be based on factors like mapping of cases and contact-tracing of Covid-19 patients and their spread. Union cabinet secretary had also held a video conference with municipal commissioners and district magistrates of 13 cities including Kolkata, Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai in this regard in the last week of May. “An area will automatically come out of the containment zone marked in red and enter the green zone if no positive case surfaced in two weeks,” said a top official of the KMC.The union government, however, has made it clear that the resumption of some activities will be done in phases. Enough space has been left for states to tweak the relaxations as per the conditions prevailing in their jurisdictions. A senior official of the city’s civic body also said that random screening tests – Oximetre tests - would be carried out in Kolkata’s municipal markets.“Also we have seen that even though the spread of coronavirus in slums has been somewhat contained, over the past few days most of the cases are being reported from apartments, campuses and individual houses,” said Atin Ghosh, a member of the KMC’s board of administrators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-s-containment-zone-area-trimmed-to-give-more-people-liberties/story-LxYjWoTJkJkJoDP5cpUk8N.html

The organisation was asked to send back foreign members of the Jamaat to their countries and Indian members to their states.“However, no one paid any heed to the lawful directions of Delhi Police and to the contrary, an audio recording purportedly by Maulana Mohd Saad, head of the Tablighi Jamaat, was found to be in circulation on social media in which the speaker was heard asking his followers to defy the lockdown and social distancing and to attend the religious gathering of Markaz,” the affidavit said.The risk posed by Covid-19 was subsequently conveyed to Saad and the Markaz’s management on several occasions during meetings held in the police station but the organisation “deliberately disobeyed” the directions of authorities, the Centre said.“Maulana Mohd Saad and Markaz management did not inform any health department or government agency about the huge gathering inside the Markaz. Written notices were also issued to Maulana Saad and Markaz management. However, they refused to pay any heed,” it alleged. The Nizamuddin area of Delhi was sealed on March 30 after it came to light that many people, who attended a religious event organised by the Tablighi Jamaat in March, were found to be infected by the Coronavirus. At least 16,500 people visited the Jamaat’s headquarters in Nizamuddin during March 13-24.A person named Supriya Pandita approached the Supreme Court in April to seek a CBI probe into alleged lapses by the Delhi government and Delhi Police that led to the congregation at the Markaz.“Ignoring all social distancing norms to avoid the deadly coronavirus, hundreds had been staying in the 100-year-old mosque since March 8. More than 2,000 delegates from Malaysia, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Kyrgyzstan attended the congregation of Tablighi Jamaat,” Pandita told the court.The Supreme Court sought the Centre’s response when the matter was last heard on May 27.The Centre, in its response, told the court that the probe by Delhi Police into the incident is at an advanced stage and a CBI investigation isn’t necessary. The bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde then adjourned the case for two weeks.Pandita alleged that Delhi Police failed to arrest Saad, who organised the religious event that resulted in a surge in Covid-19 cases. People who attended the gathering tested positive in different parts of India, causing “cluster transmission” of the virus, Pandita contended.The Centre highlighted that Delhi Police are conducting an investigation into the incident on a day-to-day basis and gave details of actions taken against the violators.“SHO police station Hazrat Nizamuddin requested the crime branch to take necessary action as per law against Maulana Mohd Saad and others of Markaz for their unlawful acts. Union Ministry of Home Affairs has blacklisted 960 foreigners present in India on tourist visas for their involvement in Tablighi Jamaat activities. MHA has also directed DGPs of all concerned states/union territories to take necessary legal action against all violators (who attended Markaz),” the affidavit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/markaz-management-deliberately-disobeyed-police-directions-centre-tells-sc/story-Yyqki8xa0mDbEPJM3kHU8N.html

The protest took place on June 3.“The protesting faculty members are requested not to sully the image of the university by violating the Covid-19 guidelines when the nation is working hard to contain the spread of coronavirus,” university said in a statement.The JNU Teachers’ Association (JNUTA), however, said they did not flout any rule and followed social-distancing norms.The Federation of Central Universities Teachers’ Associations (FEDCUTA) had expressed solidarity with the protest, JNUTA secretary Surajit Majumdar was quoted as saying by PTI.The secretary said some teachers protested from their homes holding placards, while a few gathered.“It is ridiculous to say people shouldn’t protest because of Covid-19 when unjust arrests are being made in the midst of the pandemic. The image of the university will only be sullied if the University community is silent with regard to the injustice seen all around,” Majumdar told PTI. The CAA which was passed in December 2019 amends Section 2 of the Citizenship Act, 1955, which defines “illegal migrants”. According to change in definition, any person belonging to Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian communities from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, and who have been exempted by the Central Government under the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 or the Foreigners Act, 1946, shall not be treated as “illegal migrant”. Consequently, such persons shall be eligible to apply for citizenship by naturalisation, which is laid down under Section 6 of the 1955 act.The exclusion of Muslim community from the benefits of CAA had led to widespread protests across the country, as did the linking of citizenship with religion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/do-not-sully-image-jnu-to-teachers-protesting-against-caa-amid-covid-19/story-AhsmsnBMArPbvRsfnzWOSM.html

He added that around 42 lakh people were already absorbed in the state through the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) and others are getting enlisted for several construction projects that have resumed in the state. “A comprehensive project has been prepared by the state. Skill mapping of all migrants is being done including other youth and unemployed workforce. We are working together with industries, businesses to provide them jobs. Additionally, there is a bid to increase employment in other sectors like agriculture.” Adityanath said while speaking exclusively to Shashi Shekhar, the chief editor of Hindi daily Hindustan.The UP CM said his government was trying to deal with the dual challenge of fighting the disease and giving impetus to resumption of commercial activities in the state for providing employment and boosting growth.“Our priority at the moment is to provide good healthcare and means of sustenance along with skill mapping. Every migrant labourer is being provided with food kits, and sustenance allowance apart from being connected to the skill mapping exercise. We are also working on economically empowering them through employment. There is rapid progress in setting up a commission to deal with migrants rights and employment issues in the state.”He added that the new commission will bring ministers, worker representatives and industry people on one platform with one common goal. He said the government was looking at the MSME sector and the allied agriculture sector as major potential employment providers.“I am happy to announce that around 1,000 big industries restarted operations in the state coinciding with the third phase of lockdown, providing work to over 75,000 people. Additionally, over 30 lakh people have found jobs with the MSME sector so far,” he said.He added that several workers are being enlisted for the construction work for new hospitals, highways, universities, metro projects that have resumed in earnest.“Currently 41-42 lakh people are getting employment through the rural jobs guarantee scheme MGNREGS in the state,” he said.Highlighting the steps taken by the government to save jobs during the lockdown, Adityanath said special effort was made to ensure that 119 sugar mills, 12,000 brick kilns, 2,500 cold storages continued their operation even during the lockdown.“We are trying to ensure social and economic security for the youth of the state and the new commission set up for this purpose is working towards meeting those goals which will be achieved through the MSME sector aided by one district one product scheme being supported by PM’s package,” the CM added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-and-economic-security-for-migrants-up-s-priority-adityanath/story-7THyhHzbaTiOhRzztm4JCM.html

Italy was the first European country to be hit hard by coronavirus and was widely seen to have been caught off-guard. According to the World Health Organisation’s situation report, Italy has reported 2.33 lakh Covid-19 cases and over 33,000 deaths.Watch | ‘Rahul Gandhi & his family will turn India into Italy’: Yogi Adityanath Also read| ‘An ugly joke’: CM Yogi Adityanath on Congress’ bus offer to ferry migrantsIndia, in contrast, has reported 2.26 lakh cases and 6,348 deaths.In recent weeks, Rahul Gandhi has been hurling darts at the Bharatiya Janata Party governments at the Centre as well as Uttar Pradesh and has questioned the impact of the lockdown ordered by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on March 24 to defeat the virus. The lockdown did slow down the virus but it also brought the economy to a grinding halt and is expected to increase joblessness.Yogi Adityanath blamed Congress leaders for most problems facing the country, saying the party which was in power for decades after independence did not have an agenda for the country or a vision for the people.“There was just one testing laboratory in the country when the first case of coronvirus was detected in the country. Today there are nearly 650 and about 2 lakh tests are being conducted every day. This is PM Modi’s vision, he said. In Uttar Pradesh, the government has deployed nearly 1 lakh medical screening teams for containment zones and screening of migrant workers who returned to the state.The chief minister also described the criticism of the government’s handling of the pandemic as an effort to score political points, asserting that people doing politics in times of coronavirus are insulting people and weakening the fight against the disease.But you don’t let them contribute, he was asked, a reference to the back-and-forth over the Congress general secretary Priyanka Gandhi’s offer to send across buses to help poor migrant workers reach home.“It is in their genes to lie”, the chief minister said.Yogi Adityanath said the government had accepted their offer. But the Congress didn’t send the buses, he said, adding that a large number of vehicles listed as buses by the Congress did not have their documents intact. There were buses without registration documents, valid insurance or both. Some of the vehicles mentioned by the Congress weren’t buses, or even three-wheelers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-turn-india-into-italy-yogi-adityanath-stings-rahul-gandhi-over-covid-19-response/story-8zGKMQI7mLKuAqojQphdTN.html
05-06-2020||India||PM Modi, his govt only know how to manufacture jumlas: Congress||New Delhi: The Congress on Friday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s slogan of “vocal for local” to make the country self-reliant was yet another ‘jumla’ (rhetoric) to divert the people’s attention from real issues.Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal alleged that the prime minister and his government could only manufacture jumlas, statements and slogans, and asked how India can become self-reliant till it creates innovation and intellectual property in its universities.“This is an act of self-deception. This is another ‘jumla’ that you sell to the people of the country,” he said, addressing a media briefing via video conference.“We are only manufacturing ‘jumlas’, statements and slogans. That is the only thing we make in India, and we are masters at that under this government,” Sibal added.He said the prime minister has given a call for “Atmanirbhar Abhiyaan”, but his government has failed to help make the poor, farmers, migrant workers, industry or states self-reliant.“Similarly, his calls to industry to push ‘Made in India, Made for the World’, to expand globally, and not be dependent on another country in the strategic sector did not have a clear road map as to how this goal should be achieved,” said Sibal.He said the Rs 20-lakh crore Atmanirbhar package does not lead to expansion of government expenditure, as it includes measures already announced by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and in the budget, and amounts to less than 1% of GDP, as against 10% claimed by the ruling party.“The reality is that Modi’s Atmanirbhar idea is merely a slogan like innumerable others,” Sibal said, and sought private investment in universities to create innovation and ideas.However, he was quick to add that this did not amount to privatisation. Aman Sinha, a spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), responded to the Congress’s trenchant criticism of the PM’s Atmanirbhar Bharat call to tide over the deepening economic crisis because of the pandemic.“The Rs 20 lakh crore economic package provides numerous measures towards promoting and supporting home-grown enterprises such as all the tenders below Rs200 crore are exclusively earmarked for Indian companies. However, Congress spokespersons, like their leader Rahul Gandhi, have developed a habit of speaking without studying the finer points of the government’s policies,” he said.“India has also risen above over 30 countries in the Global Innovation Index since the Congress party lost power in 2014,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-only-knows-how-to-manufactures-jumlas-congress/story-Ak3rArbQuhIoC9c0eU70vJ.html

Ataur Rahman and Paresh Sharma of Jajori police station in Nagaon district have been arrested after Phanidhar Borah, a village defence party (VDP) secretary, died at a hospital in Guwahati on Thursday.“Initial investigation suggested that the accused constables had some personal enmity with Borah. They were engaged in a scuffle on Tuesday night,” said Gaurav Abhijit Dilip, superintendent of police (SP), Nagaon.“Borah, who sustained injuries, was admitted to a hospital in Nagaon. On Thursday, the doctors referred him to Guwahati for better treatment. He died during treatment at a hospital in Guwahati. This is not a case of custodial death,” he added.Local residents surrounded Jajori police station, demanding the arrest of the two constables, after the news of Borah’s death spread. An additional police force had to be deployed to bring the situation under control.“The constables were arrested after Borah’s family members filed a first information report (FIR), naming the duo as the accused. There was no police case against Borah and it was a case of personal enmity. The officer in-charge of Jajori station has also been transferred,” the SP said.“The accused constables have been produced in court and remanded to police custody. Further investigations are on,” he added.On Friday, GP Singh, additional director-general of police (DGP) (law and order), Assam Police, visited Jajori and met Borah’s family members. He assured them of swift legal action and a compensation of Rs1 lakh for Borah’s death. “We’ll try and file the charge sheet in this case with 15 days. If required, the case will be handed over to a fast track court so that the accused can be convicted by this year,” Singh told media persons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/51-year-old-man-dies-in-assam-after-police-beating-two-constables-arrested/story-2H12zzlT7VxOXxljbeXA6I.html

05-06-2020||India||Thundershowers likely in Delhi today, light rain expected over the weekend||Thundershowers accompanied by lightning and gusty winds will affect various parts of north-west India and the western Himalayan region on Friday and over the weekend, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) authorities. The inclement weather is because of a western disturbance that is affecting the western Himalayas and moisture incursion due to cyclone Nisarga, which hit the Maharashtra coast on Wednesday. “We can expect thundershowers in the Delhi-national capital region (NCR) on Friday and light rain over the weekend. There is no forecast for a heatwave for some time now in Delhi. Maximum temperatures may rise by three to four degrees Celsius after Saturday, but we’re not expecting a heatwave till June 15, and after that heatwave is unlikely. Delhi may get rains again after June 10 due to the likelihood of a formation of a low-pressure area,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Thunderstorm accompanied with lightning and gusty winds over the north-western region during the next two days and some heavy rainfall is also likely over Uttarakhand, eastern Uttar Pradesh and southern Rajasthan during the next 24 hours, IMD said in its Friday bulletin.The south-west monsoon has also advanced into the central Arabian Sea, Kerala and Mahe, some parts of Karnataka etc. Conditions are becoming favourable for its further advancement of south-west monsoon into some more parts of central Arabian Sea, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, Karaikal, south-west and the east-central Bay of Bengal; the south-east Bay of Bengal and some parts of west-central Bay of Bengal during the next two days, the bulletin added.There were apprehensions among meteorologists that monsoon advancement could slow down a bit, as its flow is pulled in towards cyclone Nisarga but that is not a cause for concern anymore, scientists said. “If Nisarga would have moved north-westwards towards Oman coast, then that would have delayed or stalled the monsoon flow for some time. Nisarga moved close to the coast and as a result, the problem didn’t arise. The monsoon current was strengthened and it has reached Karwar in Karnataka on Thursday,” said K Sathi Devi, head, National Weather Forecasting Centre.“A fresh low-pressure area is likely to develop over the east-central Bay of Bengal on Monday. We can’t say for now what impact it’ll have and whether it’ll intensify,” added Devi.Average monsoon rain across the country from June 1 to June 4 has been 24.3 millimetres (mm) compared to normal of 11.6 mm. Central India has received the highest rains in the past four days at 28.4 mm compared to a normal of 7.4 mm.Widespread rain and thundershowers along the west coast and scattered rainfall activity over Gujarat, interior Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, interior Karnataka and Tamil Nadu is likely over the next four-five days.Heavy rainfall is also very likely over Kerala, Konkan and Goa during the next three days and over coastal Karnataka during the next 24 hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thundershowers-likely-in-delhi-today-light-rain-expected-over-the-weekend/story-idD34HCc5HKV5RlVm1NrcI.html

05-06-2020||India||Pleas on Jamia violence during CAA-protests to be heard on June 12||The Delhi High Court Friday said it will hear next week pleas related to the violence during Jamia Millia Islamia University protests against the Citizenship (amendment) Act (CAA) in December last year.A bench of Chief Justice D N Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan listed the matter for June 12 after senior advocate Colin Gonsalves and lawyer Sneha Mukherjee, appearing for the petitioner, sought time to file rejoinder to the Delhi Police’s affidavit which was submitted on Thursday.The hearing was conducted through video conferencing as the functioning of courts have been restricted due to the COVID-19 pandemic.Delhi Police, represented through advocates Amit Mahajan and Rajat Nair, sought dismissal of pleas seeking quashing of FIRs and directions against alleged police brutality in the university during the anti-CAA protests. It said the petitions were an utter abuse of PIL jurisdiction as the incidents of violence in and around the campus were well-planned and orchestrated attempts by some persons with local support.One of the petitioners, Nabila Hasan, has sought action against the police for allegedly brutally attacking the petitioners, students and residents of Jamia Millia Islamia. The plea sought against the alleged ruthless, and excessive use of force and aggression unleashed by police and paramilitary forces on students within the university.Opposing a batch of PILs seeking setting up of a judicial commission to look into the violence, the police has said the claim of police brutality is utter falsehood.The police has filed the affidavit in response to various petitions, moved by lawyers, students of JMI, residents of Okhla in south Delhi, where university is located and the Imam of Jama Masjid mosque opposite Parliament House, in which they had also sought medical treatment, compensation and interim protection from arrest for the students.The pleas have also sought registration of FIRs against the erring police officers.The affidavit filed by Rajesh Deo, Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, said exercising fundamental right to dissent should be respected, but “no person can be allowed to commit breach of law, indulge in violence, arson and riotous activity causing danger to life, limb and property of innocent citizens under the garb of exercise of fundamental right of free speech and assembly”.Such fundamental rights are not absolute and are liable to reasonable restrictions under the Constitution, it said.Under the garb of organising a protest, it is completely impermissible for the citizens to create law and order situation and to lay a siege and paralyse the day to day activity of fellow citizens who are completely unconnected with the cause for which protests are organised by a section of the society, it said.The police said that videos and photographs collected by it show that under the garb of student protest, it was a well-planned and orchestrated attempt by some persons with local support to intentionally perpetrate violence in the area.It said the evidence showed that there was large scale violence, arson and stone pelting on December 13 and 15, 2019, which resulted in lodging of three FIRs.Regarding the prayer in the petitions to frame guidelines on use of force to govern the conduct of police personnel in such cases, the affidavit said it is not maintainable and added that due procedure/ standard protocol was followed by the police authorities to control the unruly mob and to maintain law and order in the area.On the violence incident of December 15, the affidavit has said, police received an input that some former students and other persons will assemble at JMI for protesting the newly acted CAA and NRC and will go to Parliament and the President House.The investigation revealed that local leaders and politicians were instigating the protestors and were raising extremely provocative and inciting slogans and the gathering had swelled to about 3500.

The top court also asked all states to create employment opportunities for migrants returning home. The hearing comes days after the top court took suo moto cognisance of the issue and passed several orders to facilitate migrants’ return home.“We propose 15 days’ time so that states can be permitted to effectuate the completion of transport,” said the top court.The Centre said over 42,00 Shramik Specials have been run till June 3 to transport 1 crore migrant workers to their homes across the country. The Centre told the top court that an investigation into instances of deaths of migrant workers aboard the special trains has revealed that none died on account of lack of food, water or medicines. Those who died were having co-morbidities or suffered heart attack, Mehta told the court.Migrant workers, many left jobless and homeless after their workplaces or work sites shut during the ongoing lockdown imposed on March 25 to fight the spread of the coronavirus disease, have struggled to get home.Ranjit Kumar, appearing for the Bihar government, told the apex court that around 28 lakh people have returned to the state and that employment opportunities are being worked out for them. “The government of Bihar is taking all steps for providing them employment,” he said.The court asked Rajasthan to list out how many more migrant workers want to go back home.”There are not many people. Please give 15 days to send everyone home,” said Manish Singhvi, representing the government of Rajasthan.In an earlier hearing, the court issued a seven-point interim order that said it was the job of the state to provide migrant workers food and transport and that they cannot be charged for their travel. The court also remarked that no state can refuse to take back migrant workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-days-to-transport-all-migrants-to-their-homes-supreme-court-to-centre-states/story-YxCAoJFYDcy9TPYv4gDyeO.html

The lawyer alleged that Maneka Gandhi made false and frivolous allegations against the district of Malappuram and its residents, it added.After the elephant died, the former Union minister had tweeted that Malapuram is “known for its intense animal activity” and yet authorities did not take any action to curb the menace.The elephant died after she ate the pineapple stuffed with firecrackers and forest officials said that it died standing in the River Velliyar after it suffered an injury in its lower jaw.It was seen standing in the river with her mouth and trunk in the water after the firecracker-filled fruit exploded in her mouth.Chandran, through the complaint, prayed to the district police chief to register an FIR against Maneka Gandhi and others under Section 153A, 120B etc of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He said the elephant died on May 29 in Palakkad and not in Malappuram as claimed by a section of social media users. Prominent news outlets operating from the South also reported that the elephant died after consuming explosive-laden pineapple in PalakkadHe said that the unfortunate death of the elephant in Mannarkkad area of Palakkad district dominated social media conversations in the last two days but a group of people deliberately added communal colour into it only to spread hatred against Malappuram, which is a Muslim-majority district in Kerala, according to ANI.Chandran also named Tarek Fatah, a political commentator, for allegedly starting a hate campaign against the district and the minority community.A man has been arrested and another detained in connection with the elephant’s death.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-elephant-s-death-lawyer-files-complaint-against-maneka-gandhi-others-for-hate-campaign/story-8lF9OlCJWIdqVs6GJgXR3J.html

The actual package, he said, will be announced after assessment of the situation there.“We may approach Centre for relief package once the assessment is done,” Thackeray said.Cyclone Nisarga had made landfall near Alibaug in Raigad district on June 3, causing widespread damage in the area.There are roofless houses, collapsed walls and uprooted trees in the coastal villages of Raigad district, which was battered by the cyclone.Nisarga made landfall in Shrivardhan taluka of the district on Wednesday afternoon with heavy rains and gusty winds of a speed of more than 110 to 120 kmph.Metkarni village in Shrivardhan, with a population of around 700, is one of the worst-hit areas in the district.Situated on a hilltop, the village suffered severe damage as several residents were rendered homeless and penniless because of the storm.“There is nothing in my house now, the roof was blown away, a wall has collapsed and all essentials and utensils are damaged. Even my sewing machine, which was my only source of income, lies broken,” Sunita Salve, who did minor tailoring work to feed her parents and two children, told news agency PTI.Salve and her family ran out of their home at the nick of time with whatever valuables they could carry when they heard someone shouting about the storm’s arrival.“I urge the government to help people who have lost everything in the cyclonic storm,” Manjula Jadhav, another resident of the village, told PTI.The situation is similar in villages of Harihareshwar, Murud, Tala, Pen, Mhasala and Roha, where the cyclone left a trail of destruction.Thackeray visited the Raigad district on boat on Friday.

But it was revealed on the operation table that the cable had been inserted through the man’s penile urethra.“The patient came to us with severe abdomen pain and told us that he consumed a headphone cable by mistake. We examined his stool and conducted an endoscopy as well but couldn’t find the cable. When we operated him, there was nothing in his gastrointestinal tract,” Dr Walliul Islam, a noted surgeon in Guwahati, said.Surprised, Islam conducted an X-ray while the patient was on the operation table. It revealed that the cable was in fact in the person’s urinary bladder. The cable was removed and the patient is recovering well.“He told us that he had consumed headphones through the mouth, but in fact, he had inserted the mobile charger cable through his penis. I have been conducting surgeries for 25 years now but this is the first time such a case happened on the operation table,” said Islam.According to the doctor, the patient has a habit of inserting cables and other stuff through his penis as a form of sexual pleasure. On this occasion, things could have gone out of control and the cable reached his urinary bladder.“It’s a type of masturbation called urethral sounding, which is the insertion of an object or liquid into the urethra. The person had come to us five days after he inserted the cable. He repeatedly told us he consumed it through his mouth and we never imagined an adult would lie about such a thing,” Islam said. “We could have done away with the surgery if he had told us the truth and could have removed the cable through the same route he had inserted it. But surgery had to be done as he lied,” he added.Islam said the patient doesn’t have any mental disorder and indulged in the act only for sexual pleasure.“Instances of men indulging in urethral sounding are known. But this person went to an extreme and hence the cable reached his urinary bladder. This is a very rare thing,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-complained-of-stomach-ache-had-a-mobile-phone-charger-in-his-bladder/story-hA4CuevqkN3sm1keM5oUYI.html
05-06-2020||India||On Covid-19 treatment fee, Supreme Court’s question to private hospitals||Private hospitals were asked by the Supreme Court on Friday if they can treat the coronavirus patients at the much lesser fee as charged under the government’s affordable insurance scheme Ayushman Bharat.The ‘Ayushman Bharat – Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana’ is aimed at providing health cover to poor and vulnerable persons in the country.The top court clarified that it is not asking private hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients for free, but is only asking those who have been given land at concessional rates by the government to treat certain number of such infected patients for free. “I just want to know if hospitals are ready to charge at Ayushman rates?,” CJI SA Bobde observed during the hearing which was conducted through video-conferencing. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, told the apex court that the government is doing its best and people who cannot afford treatment are covered under the Ayushman Bharat scheme.The country has been reporting a high number of coronavirus cases in the last few days. There were 9,851 new Covid-19 cases and 273 deaths in the last 24 hours across the country, the Union health ministry data showed today.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-covid-19-treatment-fee-supreme-court-s-question-to-private-hospitals/story-7d44tXGUd8LI026PXoOs3L.html

Traffic flow has gone up because shops have reopened after over 60 days,” said a Mumbai Traffic Police official.The traffic flow has increased on the Western Express Highway (WEH), which stretches from the suburban Dahisar to Bandra. Similar scenes were reported during the morning rush hour on the Sion-Panvel highway, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Road in central Mumbai, King’s Circle, and Kalanagar flyover. The toll plazas reported congestion, as the vehicular movement to Mumbai from neighbouring areas such as Thane, Navi Mumbai, Mira Road, and Vasai have increased significantly.Mumbai Traffic Police authorities are expecting a further surge in people’s movement because suburban train services are yet to begin and Brihanmumbai Electricity Supply and Transport (BEST) buses are running at 50% of their capacity in a bid to maintain social distancing norms. Some people are preferring to use their personal vehicles to public transport as a precautionary measure against the raging contagion.The civic authorities have allowed outdoor recreational activities such as jogging, cycling, running, and walking in open public spaces, parks, and playgrounds from June 3. Government-run offices are allowed to function either 15% or 15 employees, whichever is lower. Motor garages, automobile repair shops and service centres have been allowed to resume their business activities.Friday was the first day when Mumbai’s shops and markets have been allowed to open between 9 am and 5 pm on odd-even days as part of Maharashtra’s Mission Begin Again.Taxis and auto-rickshaws are also back on the road. Private offices can open from June 8 with 10% of their employees, but the rest of the staff have to work from home.However, these relaxations don’t apply to containment zones, where only essential services such as chemist shops and grocery shops have been allowed to remain open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-traffic-increases-as-state-opens-up-mmr-roads-traffic-police-to-initiate-random-checks/story-YotqZx0uokH4l5FHDaCRWN.html
05-06-2020||India||In rebuttal to Pak, India quotes Imran Khan’s ‘40,000 terrorists’ remark||A new UN report that refers to the presence of thousands of Pakistani terrorists in Afghanistan is a reiteration of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s acknowledgement last year that his country hosts up to 40,000 terrorists, people familiar with developments said on Friday.Reacting to the Pakistan Foreign Office’s contention that the external affairs ministry was using the UN report to “slander Pakistan”, the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the UN Security Council’s analytical support and sanctions monitoring team had only reiterated what Khan “has already confessed”.As first reported by HT, the UN report, issued last month, said there are some 6,500 Pakistani nationals among foreign terrorists operating in Afghanistan, and the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) play a key role in bringing foreign fighters into the war-torn country.“Pakistan’s Foreign Office would do well to recall that their prime minister admitted last year that Pakistan still hosts 30,000 to 40,000 terrorists. Pakistan’s leadership is also on record acknowledging that in the past, terrorists had used the country’s soil to carry out terror attacks on other countries,” said one of the people cited above.Speaking at the US Institute of Peace in Washington last July, Khan had said Pakistan still has “about 30,000 to 40,000 armed people who have been trained and fought in some part of Afghanistan or Kashmir”.“The UN Security Council’s analytical support and sanctions monitoring team’s report has only reiterated what the prime minister of Pakistan has already confessed. Instead of casting aspersions on the report, Pakistan should introspect and put an end to any kind of support for terrorism emanating from territories under its control,” the person said.The person added that the UN and the world community are “acquainted with the reality that Pakistan is the nerve centre of terrorism”.Pakistan houses “one of the largest numbers of UN-designated terrorists and terrorist entities”, and its “fallacious attempts to point fingers at others cannot deflect attention from the facts on the ground”, the person said.“Moreover, Pakistan’s attempts to create a divide in the traditional and friendly relations between the people of India and Afghanistan will not succeed. The people of Afghanistan and the international community are well aware of who the ‘spoiler’ is, and who is sheltering, training, arming and financing terrorists and sponsoring violence against innocent Afghans and members of the international community,” the person said.In a statement issued on Thursday, Pakistan’s Foreign Office had contended the external affairs ministry had misrepresented the UN report to slander Pakistan. “Pakistan categorically rejects India’s malicious allegations, which are aimed at misleading the international community,” it said.The statement said there was no reference to “safe havens” in Pakistan in the report, which it claimed was based on “briefings provided in Afghanistan to the [UN team] by certain quarters who have long expressed scepticism about the Afghan peace process”.The Foreign Office also contended India was trying to “create complications for the Afghan peace process”, and that Pakistan had highlighted what it was said was India’s “sponsorship of terrorist organisations in Afghanistan”.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had reacted to the UN report by expressing India’s “serious concern” at the continued presence in Afghanistan of the senior leadership of al-Qaeda and a large number of foreign terrorists, including 6,500 Pakistan nationals. The report, he said, “vindicates India’s long-standing position that Pakistan remains the epicentre of international terrorism”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-rebuttal-to-pak-india-quotes-imran-khan-s-40-000-terrorists-remark/story-CaUcsfsqLFSiOPWJsKitoO.html

It also wants to provide the best of facilities to the tourists during their visit to these historical sites, he said.The chief minister said the history of Chhattisgarh is ancient as well as evident. He said Chhattisgarh was known as Dakshin Kosala and Dandakaranya in ancient times. And, in Valmiki’s Ramayana, Lord Ram’s journey during exile in Dandakaranya has been mentioned.According to information received from researchers, research articles and books, Lord Ram spent more than 10 years out of the 14 years of his exile in Chhattisgarh and the state’s folk songs also talk about it, he said.Baghel said Lord Ram came to Chhattisgarh from north India after spending ‘Chamasa’ at various places and then went to south India. Hence, Chhattisgarh is also called ‘Dakshin Path’.“Lord Ram entered Chhattisgarh from a place called Sitamarhi Harchaika via the Gawai River in Koriya district and went to south India from Ramaram in Sukma district. During the entire route, he visited 75 sites,” Baghel stated.The chief minister said nine sites have been selected in the first phase for the purpose of developing Ram Van Gaman tourism circuit in Chhattisgarh. These sites include Sitamarhi-Harchaika (Koriya), Ramgarh (Ambikapur), Shivrinarayan (Janjgir-Champa), Turturiya (Baloda Bazar), Chandkhuri (Raipur), Rajim (Gariaband), Sihawa-Saptarishi Ashram (Dhamtari), Jagdalpur (Bastar) and Ramaram (Sukma).For the Ram Van Gaman tourism circuit, the state government had made a provision of Rs 5 crore last year (2019-20) and Rs 10 crore this year (2020-21) in the budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-writes-to-union-tourism-minister-for-development-of-ram-van-gaman-circuit/story-LFwKKqBnvEFpeqgwI5oGzJ.html

He also set out the country’s principled approach to international relations, which the foreign policy establishment will bring to the table at the UN Security Council once India is elected for a two-year term.Secretary (west) Vikas Swarup of the external affairs ministry said India’s candidature is expected to succeed as it is the single endorsed candidate of the Asia-Pacific group. This would be India’s eighth term on the UN Security Council, and the two-year tenure will start in January 2021.“India’s overall objective during this tenure in the UN Security Council will be the achievement of NORMS or a “New Orientation for a Reformed Multilateral System”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-outlines-priorities-for-election-to-un-security-council/story-MtbqVWUye7MOW9v4gQAmAN.html
05-06-2020||India||Third Congress lawmaker resigns ahead of Rajya Sabha polls on June 19||Another Congress MLA tendered his resignation to Gujarat Assembly Speaker Rajendra Trivedi on Friday, news agency ANI reported.“I have accepted it. He is Brijesh Merja, the MLA from Morbi,” ANI quoted Trivedi as saying.Two Congress lawmakers resigned on Thursday, in a setback to the party ahead of the June 19 elections to four Rajya Sabha seats from the state.The resignations prompted the Congress to divide its remaining legislators into seven groups and rush them to different places in the state to prevent further desertions until the polling is held, party functionaries aware of the matter said. The Gujarat seats are going to the polls along with 20 others across the country.Five Congress legislators earlier resigned from the assembly in March. Two more seats remain vacant in the state assembly because of litigation due to poll-related disputes.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with 103 seats needs two more votes to win three of the four Rajya Sabha seats.The Congress is banking on Bharatiya Tribal Party’s two, the lone legislator of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and independent lawmaker Jignesh Mevani to win two seats. The BJP has fielded Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramilaben Bara, and Narhari Amin. Shaktisinh Gohil and Bharatsinh Solanki are the Congress’s candidates.Congress leader Ahmed Patel accused the BJP of horse-trading amid the Covid-19 crisis. “Isn’t Gujarat government the only one in the world where: 1) Government has abandoned people in the middle of a global pandemic? 2) Refused to fund train fare for poor migrants? 3) But leaves no stone unturned to fund horse-trading activities for a Rajya Sabha election?” he tweeted.The BJP rejected the allegations, saying Congress legislators were leaving the party as they were “unhappy” with its leadership. “I believe that some more Congress legislators would also resign in the near future. They are leaving Congress because they are unhappy with the party leadership,” Amin said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/third-congress-lawmaker-resigns-ahead-of-rajya-sabha-polls-on-june-19/story-6e8ANXtE4SNsJPp3VhW6aP.html

05-06-2020||India||Environment, man-animal conflict: Unlock 1 poses challenge for Uttarakhand||There has been a reduction in man-animal conflict in Uttarakhand and an overall decrease in pollution levels in the state, especially in Ganga during the Covid-19 lockdown. But now the officials and green activists are worried that with movement of people, resumption of commercial and industrial activities and traffic under Unlock 1.0, these might increase again.SP Subodh, member secretary Uttarakhand Environment Protection and Pollution Control Board (UEPPCB) said that there has been definitely a decrease in pollution levels in Ganga and other rivers of the state and general improvement in air quality in major cities due to almost non-existent traffic on the roads.“The tourists and pilgrims didn’t come during lockdown which also contributed in a major way in the decrease in the pollution levels in the state. When tourists come, they leave behind a lot of waste which adds to the solid waste and water pollution in the state. Also with factories closed during the lockdown, lesser pollutants were entering water bodies body, helping them cleanse themselves,” he said.Uttarakhand annually attracts over 3.5 crore tourists and pilgrims.Subodh said they have again taken samples from Ganga to check what is the status in the pollution levels with Unlock 1.0 underway. “Earlier, we had taken samples in April in which we saw significant improvement in the water quality during the lockdown. Based on the new findings which will come in a few days, we will make suggestions to the state and Central government on how to keep the water quality of Ganga consistent,” said Subodh.Last time during April, when UEPPCB had taken samples from Ganga, it had found a 47% reduction in fecal coliform observed at Lakshmanjhula, 46% at the barrage downstream in Rishikesh, and 25% at Bindughat (upstream of Haridwar), besides 20% reduction in biochemical oxygen demand at Har Ki Pauri in Haridwar.With wild animals like leopards, Nilgai, bears and elephants venturing near human habitations and on to roads during the lockdown period, the state forest department had formed teams in many areas to keep tab wildlife movement. Two elephants were even spotted at the busy Har Ki Pauri ghat and BHEL township in Haridwar. Officials in the state forest department said lockdown restrictions on vehicular traffic and human movement made it easier for wild animals to venture near human settlements and highways.Rajiv Bhartari, chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand, said that due to lockdown there was less human interference in wildlife habitats and areas around them. “Lockdown gave time to wildlife, environment and nature and planet Earth to rejuvenate and heal themselves. It also made us realise how we should take the environment and wildlife seriously. I think post-lockdown, our biggest challenge is how to stop all such activities that harm environment and wildlife and disturb the balance in Nature”, he saidParag Madhukar Dhakate, chief conservator of forests (CCF) western circle Kumaon said with fewer people out, there has been an overall reduction of over 50% in the man-animal conflict in the state. “Now our biggest concern is that wild animals have got habituated to deserted roads and would come out on to the roads and near habitations. With people coming out in Unlock 1.0, we are exploring ways and strategies to check their conflict with the humans,” he said.Dhakate said the lockdown had proved to be good for wildlife and the environment in the state. “Apart from humans, animals were also getting comparatively cleaner air and water. Now it will be our biggest challenge to maintain this level with regard to less pollution and less man-animal conflict.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/environment-man-animal-conflict-unlock-1-poses-challenge-for-uttarakhand/story-kJhpDZCbWXMKR6whaZUk8O.html

The schemes already approved under the Budget will also stay suspended till March 31.“In-principle approval for such schemes will not be given this financial year. Initiation of new schemes already appraised/approved will remain suspended for one year till march 31, 2021,” read a statement by the finance ministry.Fighting the falling revenues due to a long-drawn out lockdown, necessitated by the coronavirus epidemic, various state governments too have put a freeze on spending.Amid calls for support, the Centre did announce Rs 20 lakh crore financial stimulus package to give more money into people’s hands and to push spending. India’s economic growth slipped to 3.1 per cent in the January-March quarter of 2019-20 showing impact of Covid-19 pandemic.

05-06-2020||India||Delhi: Woman alleges Covid-positive father ‘not admitted’ on time by hospital, dies||A woman has alleged that her Covid-19-positive father was not admitted in time by a Delhi government hospital and he died on Thursday, a charge denied by the authorities of the facility.The woman, Amarpreet Kaur, took to Twitter earlier in the day, saying, “My dad is having high fever. We need to shift him to hospital. I am standing outside LNJP Delhi & they are not taking him in. He is having corona, high fever and breathing problem. He won’t survive without help. Pls help.” My dad is having high fever. We need to shift him to hospital. I am standing outside LNJP Delhi & they are not taking him in. He is having corona, high fever and breathing problem. He won't survive without help. Pls help @raghav_chadha @ArvindKejriwal @SatyendarJain An hour later, she again tweeted, saying, “He is no more. The govt failed us.” Her tweets were widely circulated by netizens. Amarpreet is a social activist, her family said.The authorities at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan (LNJP) Hospital, a dedicated Covid-19 facility, denied the charge, saying the patient was “brought dead”.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAccording to information shared by the hospital, the 68-year-old man, who also had asthma, died at 7:37 am.“According to a report from the emergency department, the man was tested for Covid-19 at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital (SGRH) and the report came on June 1, in which he was found positive for coronavirus infection,” a senior official said.He was sent to home quarantine from there, the authorities said.On Thursday, he was brought to the casualty department of the hospital in an “unconscious state” and with a flat ECG line, and declared “brought dead”.Amarpreet lives in Gurgaon with her husband Mandeep Singh, who said the family members rushed to the hospital after getting to know about his father-in-law’s condition.“My father-in-law was taken in a car by my wife’s brother and a cousin, accompanied by my mother-in-law,” Singh said, and alleged that the LNJP Hospital staff “were not willing to see my father-in-law, even as he fainted in the car”.“They are saying he was brought dead, but was he even attended to? The staff kept saying go to Ganga Ram Hospital. We were just at a loss,” he alleged, the charge again denied by the LNJP Hospital authorities.Singh also alleged that the family “never received any call” from the SGRH on the positive Covid-19 status of his father-in-law.A spokesperson of the SGRH denied the charge, saying, “There is no truth in these allegations. However, we sympathise with the family for their loss.” Singh also claimed that the family had approached three-four other private and government hospitals a few days ago, but “could not get admission” for the deceased in any of those facilities, adding that they found out that beds were available at the LNJP Hospital, so he was taken there.Later, in a statement, the LNJP Hospital rejected the claims of the family as “incorrect and false”, saying the old man was brought to the hospital between 7:10 am and 7:30 am, was “not refused admission and examined by a doctor”.It also claimed that the first tweet was put up by Amarpreet at 8:05 am and subsequently, she sent out another tweet, saying her father died at 9:08 am, but he died at 7:37 am.Singh responded to it and claimed that the tweets were “put out from his wife’s account by a friend of hers”, as she was scrambling to get her father medical attention and hence, there could have been a delay.Asked if the man’s family was made to wait at the hospital, a source said, the LNJP Hospital, being a dedicated facility, sees a “lot of rush” of patients.“Also, there are four doctors in the casualty department, who can attend to only four patients at a time following all social-distancing and other safety guidelines. But the triage team looks out for any person in the queue, who needs immediate medical attention,” the source said.The woman later tweeted seeking Covid-19 tests for all family members.“I lost my father today morning to Covid we want other family members to get tested today only. which labs are not doing they are in danger. We are trying since morning. My mother, brother, his wife and two kids. Pls help (sic),” she said.On June 2, the woman had also tweeted: “My father is corona positive and in Delhi, no helpline is responding @ArvindKejriwal @msisodia @dilipkpandey. Immediate support is needed.” “I am extremely thankful to @dilipkpandey and others for immediate attention and support. We are proceeding on next steps as advised by doctors!” she had tweeted.Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader Pandey had helped to get a doctor on a telephone call with the family, Singh said.Delhi recorded 1,359 fresh coronavirus cases on Thursday, which took the Covid-19 tally in the city past the 25,000-mark, and the death toll due to the disease mounted to 650, authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-woman-alleges-covid-positive-father-not-admitted-in-time-by-hospital-dies/story-XJDY0gsocbWxmfEkFQSJJO.html

05-06-2020||India||On World Environment Day, PM Modi urges citizens to preserve planet’s biodiversity||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday posted wishes on the World Environment Day, urging people to preserve the planet’s rich biodiversity.“On #WorldEnvironmentDay, we reiterate our pledge to preserve our planet’s rich biodiversity. Let us collectively do whatever possible to ensure the flora and fauna with whom we share the Earth thrive. May we leave an even better planet for the coming generations,” he said on Twitter.World Environment Day is celebrated on June 5 every year.The theme of the World Environment Day this year is ‘Biodiversity’, which is described as the variety of life in a particular habitat or ecosystem, where each species has an important role to play. Upsetting this balance, including through over exploitation of the natural resources, can have enormous consequences.Experts say loss of biodiversity can lead to emergence of new infectious diseases like Covid-19.This year, the the environment ministry will hold virtual celebrations to mark the day due to the Covid-19 pandemic.On the eve of the World Environment Day on Thursday, Environment Minister Prakash Javadekar said that despite a huge human and animal population on a limited habitation area, India has been able to maintain 8 per cent of the world’s biodiversity because “our ethos is to live with nature”.In a video message, Javadekar said that there are many constraints for India in conserving the biodiversity, like 16 per cent of world’s human population and 16 per cent of cattle population living on 2.5 per cent of world’s land.Javadekar also said India is among the “very few countries walking the talk” on the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-world-environment-day-pm-modi-asks-citizens-to-preserve-planet-s-biodiversity/story-0tjNQvTLcHtxa4fd4disyO.html

The yatra, however, shall begin on July 21 for a shorter duration of 14 days and it will end on August 3,” official sources told Hindustan Times.The pilgrimage to the 3,880-metre-high holy cave shrine in south Kashmir will now be conducted from the shorter Baltal route only, they added.While Deputy Commissioner of Ganderbal, of which Baltal is a part, has already pressed men and machinery for clearing the tracks.The decision to cut-short the time period of the yatra was taken during a meeting held by Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor GC Murmu last week.The government had decided in February this year to hold the annual pilgrimage to the holy cave shrine.The Amarnath Yatra was scheduled to begin from the twin tracks of Pahalgam in Anantnag district and Baltal in Ganderbal district on June 23. The pilgrimage was to end on August 3 on the day of Shravan Purnima (Raksha Bandhan).Last year, the yatra was cut short following intelligence inputs of terror threats ahead of the Centre scrapping Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir. In 2018, the pilgrimage was held for 60 days.Thousands of pilgrims either trek the traditional and longer 45km-long Pahalgam route or the shorter 14km-long Baltal route to the holy shrine every year.The pilgrimage usually spans nearly a month and a half and takes place during July and August.One of the holiest pilgrimages in Hinduism, the yatra attracts pilgrims from India as well as across the world. There have been terror attacks on the route of the yatra in the past. The last attack took place in 2017 on a bus from Gujarat in Anantnag district that left seven pilgrims dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarnath-yatra-special-religious-ceremony-to-be-performed-in-jammu-on-friday/story-UxBZpDJIuMc433omAMMujK.html

Also read: 46% migrants back home or on wayThey stepped up their pressure after the minister of state for external affairs, V Muraleedharan, said the state’s go-slow approach resulted in the poor evacuation of residents of Kerala from abroad. The minister said only 20% of evacuations were held and the state was interested more in maintaining its record.As stranded expatriates’ woes took an emotional turn, both the state and the Centre blamed each other for their plight. Click here for full Covd-19 coverageKerala chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, however, said there was a ploy to portray the state’s track record in a bad light.“We never restricted the number of flights. We are aware of the plight of our people abroad. Some people are trying to mislead them. But their ploy won’t succeed,” he said adding the government was keen on their safety and early return. “I don’t know why people holding responsible positions are creating such confusion. I heard the Union government had some problem in dispatching too many flights,” the CM said while asked about Muraleedharan’s statement. Pinarayi Vijayan said the state had agreed to 12 flights a day and the Centre was not able to meet this request.Muraleedharan had said earlier the Centre was ready to fly 34 flights a day but the state forced it to reduce them to 12.Some of the bereaved said they never expected such an end to their loved ones and added that political parties are busy lauding their contributions but have turned a blind eye to their plight.“We could not see my father’s body. We were told his body was buried in a mosque in the UAE. It was terrible. We suffered in silence,” the daughter one of the victims in Kozhikode said, adding that her father was planning to come home in June. “Nobody has called us so far. Here parties are busy fighting for political mileage. His life should have been saved if authorities helped him return early,” she said.After the first round of lockdown, the state government had started a website for expatriates who wished to return and more than four lakh people registered in the first week itself. The latest data show less than 40,000 arrived in the last three weeks. Relatives of those aboard have said they are worried after a spurt in Covid-19 cases in some of the Gulf countries and that their return is now getting delayed inordinately. At least 18 lakh people from the state work in the Gulf.The state reported three deaths and 94 new Covid-19 cases, highest spike since the outbreak began, said the CM adding 80% of the recent cases were imported. The state’s Covid-19 tally has gone up to 1,588 and the death toll has risen to 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-kerala-lock-horns-over-expatriates-evacuation/story-ZoKSnQ23lJOzZiJD3jgVGN.html
05-06-2020||India||‘Careless govt’: Opposition claims wheat worth crores damaged in rain in MP||The rain caused by Cyclone Nisarga led to damage of crops in various parts of Madhya Pradesh. The wheat and other crops were procured by the state government.The Opposition has now attacked the government, accusing it of being “careless”.The rain came as Madhya Pradesh was already facing the challenge caused by swarms of desert locusts, which remain uncontrolled. However, the downpour brought down temperature in the state considerably low giving a relief to people from rising temperature.As per meteorological department’s Madhya Pradesh unit, as many as 23 districts received moderate to heavy rains in the past two days with Bhopal, Raisen, Betul, Hoshangabad in central region, Rewa and Satna in Vindya region, Chhatarpur, Sagar and Damoh in Bundelkhand region, Gwalior and Guna in Gwalior region, Jabalpur, Narsinghpur, Chhindwara and Mandla in Mahakoshal region and Khandwa, Khargone, Indore, Dhar, Barwani, Shajapur and Burhanpur in Malwa receiving heavy rains.The meteorological department has further issued warning for heavy rainfall in 27 districts in the next 24 hours. Rains are still continuing in several parts of the state. In Bhopal, the maximum temperature on Thursday was recorded at 22.6 degree Celsius, as many as 17 degree Celsius low than the normal temperature on the day. In Gwalior, the maximum temperature dropped by about 10 degree Celsius and in Indore and Jabalpur by about 12 and 10 degree Celsius, as per meteorological department. Joint director of agriculture department at Indore RS Sisodia said, “Rains, though it’s not pre-monsoon showers, will help farmers do cultivation. However, for sowing they need good rains during monsoon.”Revenue department principal secretary Manish Rastogi said, “There is no report of damage caused to any property due to rains has been reported so far.”However, as per reports from many districts, wheat stored in the open at procurement centres has got wet. About 15,000 quintal of wheat stored in open in Katni got wet in the past two days. The value of the wheat stored is said to be about Rs 2.81 crore. Similarly, in Rajgarh district too wheat was stored in the open at about 90 per cent of the 84 procurement centres. It got wet due to rains.State Congress president Kamal Nath accused the state government of showing carelessness in undertaking measures in storing wheat in warehouses. “Lakhs of metric tonnes of wheat got damaged resulting in loss of crores of rupees. Warning for Nisarga was given earlier but the government overlooked it. Hence, state government is responsible for the damage,” he said.Farmers welfare and agriculture development minister Kamal Patel said, “The rain is untimely. Procurement centres for wheat was increased to about 4,500 so that people don’t have to travel long distances. Though it was stored in the open, the wheat was well covered with plastic sheets. The same is being stored in warehouses and we are trying to see that least damage is caused to wheat.”Principal secretary, Food and Civil Supply, Shivshekhar Shukla said, “No damage was reported from any district. The procured food grains was properly covered and secured.”Desert locusts is another problem farmers in the state continued to grapple with even after a fortnight of swarms of locusts entered Madhya Pradesh from Rajasthan.As per officials, damage to vegetation was reported from parts of Vindhya, Beundelkhand and Gwalior-Chambal regions on Thursday.What took the district administration in Satna by surprise on Thursday was swarms of locusts entering Satna city causing a panic among residents.Deputy director of agriculture at Satna Bahorilal Kureel said, “Movement of locusts to the city was perhaps caused by rains. We faced a problem in controlling the insects as we couldn’t have used excessive amount of insecticide in killing the locusts given presence of people. We used four to five fire tenders to drive them away. The district administration was swung into action the moment they entered the city. We are keeping a watch on their further movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/careless-govt-opposition-claims-wheat-worth-crores-damaged-in-rain-in-mp/story-2gsNycvw5CNGQsxtezHrpI.html

But in Maharashtra, this number is 16.ICMR said that 1,39,485 Covid-19 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours (between Wednesday and Thursday) in the country. The total numnber of samples tested in the country is 42,42,718.Apart from Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Gujarat, Tripura and Bihar also have a higher caseload than the national average.The situation has, however, improved in Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh.If the rate of the spread of the Covid-19 infection continues, India will soon leave Italy behind. Hindustan has quoted figures from Worldometre, Italy has 2,33,836 cases of Covid-19 whereas the number has reached 2,17,965 in India.India is recording around 9,000 cases daily. At this rate, it will take India two days to cross Italy’s infection tally. However, the rate of fatality in India is much better than Italy. At nearly the same number of infection, the European country has seen five times more deaths that India.The nationwide tally of confirmed Covid-19 cases reached 2.17 lakh on Thursday with a with a record spike of 9,304 new cases in the last 24 hours (between Wednesday and Thursday) and several states reporting their highest one-day surge.The death toll has increased to 6,075 with 260 more fatalities in this period.India is now the seventh worst hit nation after the US, Brazil, Russia, the UK, Spain and Italy. In terms of fatalities, India is ranked 12th at present, while it is placed at eighth place in terms of recoveries. However, India figures among the top-five countries in terms of active cases, as also for the number of tests conducted so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-rate-of-new-infection-higher-than-national-average-in-maharashtra-improvement-in-madhya-pradesh/story-k7IMFnMWIN2RMCdp4GvEwL.html

In the incident, Hav Mathiazhagan P was critically injured. The soldier was evacuated to Army Hospital, where he succumbed to the injuries,” Lt Col Devender Anand, the defence spokesperson, said. Mathiazhagan P was a brave, highly motivated and a sincere soldier, Anand said.“The nation will always remain indebted to him for his supreme sacrifice and devotion to duty,” he added.His body will be taken by road from Akhnoor to Jammu and then to Delhi in an aircraft. From the national capital it will be taken to Coimbatore, the official said.Pakistan also violated the ceasefire in the front sector of Poonch district on Thursday night. A defence spokesperson said Pakistan initiated unprovoked ceasefire violation at about 10:45pm by firing with small arms and shelling with mortars along the Line of Control (LoC) in Kirni sector. The Indian Army is retaliating befittingly, the spokesperson added.He said that a large scale search has begun in Kalakote of Rajouri district after a terrorist was killed by security forces in an operation in the area late on Thursday.“Acting upon hard intelligence, security forces eliminated one terrorist in Dharmsal village in Kalakote area of Rajouri district. We suspect that two to three ultras are hiding there,” a source said.A local said security forces exchanged fire with terrorists in Dharmsal village around 8.15pm.There has been a spurt in terror attacks and infiltration bids in Jammu and Kashmir during the lockdown to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Pakistan has been relentlessly opening heavy fire on Indian posts and villages along the 744-km LoC for more than two and a half months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-personnel-dies-in-ceasefire-violation-in-j-k-s-rajouri/story-Al4xhKYxmyDIPYi7PZHP8H.html
05-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Does Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) work as a cure against the coronavirus disease? As a prophylaxis?What about Remdesivir?The volume of literature out there can be confusing – as can the near-realtime reporting on these, which means we are all blowing hot one day, cold the other.Still, it isn’t as bad as, say, the situation with egg yolks, ghee, or coconut oil. One part of the problem is that many of us look for headlines in research, when we should ideally be looking for nuance (I think some of the recent reports in mainstream media on Remdesivir, for instance, are guilty of this).Another is that science can only answer questions set for it – for instance, a study on whether HCQ has prophylactic benefits cannot answer questions on its therapeutic ability.And a third is that research, especially clinical research, is an iterative and reductive process, where the result of one study doesn’t as much provide a readymade answer, as point to another direction of study that could.With that lengthy preamble, let us revisit the original question – or both the original questions.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageWhat of HCQ?A paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine on June 3, based on a randomised trial, showed that the drug wasn’t effective as a prophylactic – post-exposure. “After high-risk or moderate-risk exposure to Covid-19, HCQ did not prevent illness compatible with Covid-19 or confirmed infection when used as postexposure prophylaxis within four days of exposure,” the study’s authors wrote.But an Indian study, by the Indian Council of Medical Research, reported by HT on June 1, showed that 80% of health care workers who were given at least six doses of HCQ were not infected by Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. “The main conclusion that can be drawn after analysing the data is that HCQ has beneficial effects in infection risk reduction from the fourth dose onwards,” HT reported the study’s co-author as saying. This probably suggests that the drug may work as a prophylactic in the strict sense of the term – pre-exposure. To be sure, the ICMR study is a pre-print one and yet to be peer reviewed. That means we have still not heard the last on HCQ’s ability as a prophylactic.As for its ability as a therapeutic, The Lancet is reviewing a study that dismissed this (because it seems based on dodgy data), and the World Health Organization, which suspended HCQ trials following the study, has said it will now revive them.And what of Remdesivir?This, too, is an interesting story. In late April, WHO posted on its website, and then removed, a study that claimed the drug wasn’t effective in treating Covid-19. The study was later published in The Lancet. But the same month – roughly a week after the study was published and taken down, and on the same day on which it appeared in The Lancet – the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said that its own trial of the drug suggested that the drug helped Covid-19 patients recover faster. Soon after, on May 1, the US Food and Drug Administration approved the use of the drug as a treatment for Covid-19 (in certain cases).Earlier this week, a Phase 3 trial of Remdesivir on moderately ill and hospitalised Covid-19 patients showed a positive impact on those who received the drug for five days (as compared to those who didn’t), although there was no appreciable difference between those who received the drug for 10 days and those who didn’t. The study didn’t include critically ill patients but it also didn’t include patients in the early stage of infection. Both questions – about the drug’s efficacy when it comes to treating the critically ill as well as the just-infected – merit further exploration.Interestingly, the study itself was interpreted differently by different people. Gilead’s stock fell because the study showed that the drug may not be the miracle cure everyone is looking for, although many others saw the conclusion as one that held out some hope – at least for the moderately ill. Coincidentally, India’s drug regulator approved the use of Remdesivir as a treatment for Covid-19 a day after the study’s results were published.Which is where things stand. No quick answers; several false turns; and more questions. Which is how science works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-bNc4GAOiApXtTjWaiyUGhK.html
05-06-2020||India||‘Too early to predict Covid impact on railways’, says Piyush Goyal||Railways and commerce minister Piyush Goyal says the revival of global trade, severely impacted by Covid-19, will take some time. In an interview with HT, he speaks about milestones in the Narendra Modi government’s second stint and the impact of the pandemic on Indian Railways, among other issues. Edited excerpts:In terms of the government, some very, very long-pending issues [have been take up] such as the abrogation of Articles 370 and 35A of Kashmir. The court in the same period solved the Ram Mandir issue. [Other milestones are] the triple talaq law and the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill.We gave a lot of thrust to agriculture. PM Kisan was expanded to cover all farmers. Another Rs 1 lakh crore for farm gate infrastructure was announced. We started the process of transformational policy change -- like coal mining, which was finalised in the Atmanirbhar Bharat package and also approved by the Cabinet... In this whole period, the focus has been on a number of initiatives that would strengthen India in the long term, and present opportunities for people in agriculture, food processing, fishing, mining... [Efforts have been to] try and shrink the gap between rural and urban India.During this period, the world economy was going through stress; trade wars were playing out...A number of factors worldwide made the global trade contract. And then it culminated with the Covid problem... We could not continue to grow as we would have liked to, but we look at this also as a challenge. We are very focused, as you saw from the Rs 20-lakh-crore Atmanirbhar Bharat package. It’s not about giving a short-term solution but to prepare India for the medium and long term.Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe year 2019-20 saw the highest capex (~1.61 lakh crore) in the history of Indian Railways. PM Modi has consistently believed that railways can be the engine of growth. Therefore, 2019-20 got 20% additional funds compared to 2018-19... we have spent [between 2014 and 2019] nearly two-and-a-half times more than what was spent before the Modi government came. It’s been a continuous process of massive ramp-up, of modernisation, of improving punctuality and quality of catering services. The crowning glory of the year gone by is zero passenger fatality due to rail accidents.That is one of the things we have to do to increase efficiency. It’s a part of the modernisation and efficiency improvement programme... And after we get free from this, we will be in a position to take this forward.We have started 200 long-distance mail/express trains. We already started 30 Rajdhanis. Throughout this period, you would not have heard of a single incident of food grain shortage, or fertilizer shortage for farmers, or coal shortage for powerhouses because we continued to supply all this through freight trains...We also ran nearly 3,575 parcel trains to transport small quantities of agriculture produce, fruits and vegetables. We have not done the math as yet and we will have to see how long this impact continues...The bookings are not too many. So, we will have to wait and watch. It’s a little early to predict the financial impact.It has been a setback (in terms of infrastructure) for the past three months. We have to assess now how quickly we can...get the labour back on the job. I think it’s going to still take time. The jury is out... it’s also intrinsically linked with the spread of the virus and what numbers we see going forward, and the vaccine and the cure for the virus. I think all estimates we made so far are continuously changing.In terms of RCEP, India has presented its concerns before all RCEP members. Clearly, we believe that we have to protect our domestic manufacturers, our farmers, the MSME sector, our milk producers...unless there is a full resolution of our issues, it will be very difficult for us to get back on the negotiating table.The major countries — the US, the UK, the EU — we were talking to are under severe stress. In fact, there is a lockdown in most of these places.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/too-early-to-predict-covid-impact-on-railways-says-piyush-goyal/story-f3utXn09EbMQRdTUFR0TgJ.html
05-06-2020||India||‘46% migrants back home or on way’||Total 46% of the country’s migrant workers have returned home or are on their way to their state of domicile, a data compiled by the chief labour commissioner of India has revealed.The CLC’s data, updated till June 2, has been revealed under an RTI query which shows the total number of migrant workers is 2,617,218.Chhattisgarh has the highest number of migrant workers—1,085,828—according to this estimate, followed by Kerala (2,86,846), Maharashtra (2,01,909) and Telangana (1,84,006) . These estimates, however, widely differ from the data provided by the railway ministry for its trains to take back migrant workers.According to data provided by the CLC, just 2,63,259 migrant labourers are at relief camps of shelter homes provided by the government. Another 11,29,173 have stayed back at their workplace, the CLC data shows while 12,04,786 workers are in locations other than shelter camps or workplaces, indicating they have either been transported back home or stranded outside.While the initial estimate of CLC was just 2,59,718 workers, Maharashtra later reported additional 20,000 workers. The CLC data, according to officials, possibly looks at registered migrants as the railway ministry said that 4,155 Shramik trains that operated for last 33 days have ferried more than 57 lakh migrant workers home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/46-migrants-back-home-or-on-way/story-3Xgh7pOlt7gbS6TduSkPHO.html

05-06-2020||India||In Odisha, testing for Covid-19 declines as machines malfunction||At a time when the daily testing figures for Covid-19 continues to rise in the country, the number of such tests in Odisha has been plummeting for about a fortnight with the state laboratories testing less than 3000 samples on Thursday, the lowest since May 21.Health and family welfare department officials said on June 3, the laboratories tested only 2,933 samples, its lowest since May 20. Though chief minister Naveen Patnaik last month had asked the department to augment the testing capacity to 15,000 a day, the state has so far been able to test not more than 5,612 samples; it’s highest on May 19. Since May 22, the numbers of tests have gone down except for a couple of times.Odisha additional chief secretary of health, Pradipta Mohapatra said the number of tests have gone down as the COBAS 6800 machine installed at the Regional Medical Research Centre in Bhubaneswar since April has malfunctioned for the 4th time. “The COBAS 6800 machine alone tested around 1,000 samples a day. Besides, testing has come to a halt at the Institute of Life Sciences in Bhubaneswar due to electrical short-circuit there. Pending repair of machines there, we are trying to get the samples tested at KIIT Technology Business Incubator,” said Mohapatra, adding that the government’s goal is to get all the samples tested within 48 hours of their collection.Though ICMR had allowed 19 laboratories in Odisha to test Covid-19 samples, so far 16 labs are doing the tests. Till now 165824 samples have been tested.Noted epidemiologist Jayprakash Mulyil said all states, including Odisha, should scale up testing more and more to know the extent of the spread of the disease. “The more samples you test, you may get more positive cases. But that’s crucial to find out the extent of spread,” Mulyil said.Mohapatra, however, said Odisha was testing as per ICMR guidelines. “We are mostly testing people in quarantine centres who are showing Covid-19 symptoms and people who have developed symptoms for influenza-like illness. We are also testing frontline workers involved in Covid-19 hospitals, containment zones and quarantine centres,” he said.Meanwhile, a junior doctor of AIIMS Bhubaneswar and a staff nurse in a hospital in Nayagarh district today tested positive for Covid-19 as the number of cases in the state rose to 2,488. The junior doctor was among the doctors who were on duty in the Covid-19 ward of AIIMS.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-odisha-testing-for-covid-19-declines-as-machines-malfunction/story-uKfbUP2T4wj9iaikvcAIsJ.html
05-06-2020||India||Once a Covid-19 hotspot, jails in Jaipur now have only 4 coronavirus positive cases||Once the epicenter of the Covid-19 disease, the Jaipur district and central jails are now only left with four positive cases. A total of 338 inmates of the two jails had tested positive after the first case was reported on May 11.The Jaipur district jail is located in the campus of the Jaipur Central Jail with a different entry gate. Generally, cases from the Jaipur rural belt are lodged in the district jail while the cases from city are lodged in the central jail.Deputy Inspector General (DIG), Prisons, Vikas Kumar said that dedicated Covid Care Centres have been created for the coronavirus positive inmates and staff, and they are kept under the supervision of health specialists. The undertrials are kept for 21 days in an isolation ward separate from the ward where jail inmates are lodged.“The Jaipur district jail has been made a dedicated Covid Care Centre for the inmates as well as the prisons department staff. The five wards of the jail have been bifurcated into two coronavirus wards, two isolation wards and two separate wards. A total of 60 staff from the prisons department, 12 medical staff of the health department and 20 sanitation staff are working in the jail to take care of those inmates found Covid-19 positive,” said Kumar.He added that at least four to five times, the wards and barracks of the Jaipur district jail are sanitized. The sheets and the clothes are changed at regular intervals. “In order to boost immunity, the inmates are given fruits and vegetables four times a day other than their regular diet. Those who opt for it are also given eggs. The inmates are also given ‘kadha’ (herbal decoction),” the DIG Prisons said.Kumar further informed that the staff working at the Covid Care Centres has also been given an appreciation symbol in order to motivate them. In May, the Jaipur jail had emerged as a Covid-19 hotspot with cases rising from two cases on May 11 to 338 on May 20, out of which 247 alone were reported from the district jail.The sudden spike in the number of cases was linked to a 29-year-old man who was lodged in the district jail in a case of excise by the Jamwaramgarh police station and a 20-year-old booked by the Bajaj Nagar police station for theft.The 29-year-old was arrested on April 13 by the Jamwaramgarh Police in an excise case after which he was kept in quarantine for 21 days.The 20-year-old inmate booked by the Bajaj Nagar police under IPC Section 379 (theft), 341 (wrongful restraint) and 323 (voluntarily causing hurt) was arrested on May 9 and kept in one-day police remand by the Bajaj Nagar police station. On May 10, he was sent to judicial custody.Recently, a division bench of the high court, comprising Chief Justice Indrajit Mahanty and Justice Ashok Kumar Gaur, had said the jail authorities must ensure that prior to releasing prisoners from isolation, they should be presented before doctors for a check-up to find out whether they have Covid-19 symptoms. Asymptomatic prisoners should also be tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/once-a-covid-19-hotspot-jails-in-jaipur-now-have-only-4-coronavirus-positive-cases/story-knMzNFbXVB0gdiNqPughaN.html
05-06-2020||India||SC asks for common mobility plan in NCR||The Supreme Court on Thursday asked Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to set up a uniform system for hassle-free movement within the National Capital Region (NCR), stepping in to clear up widespread confusion among thousands of commuters who have been facing difficulties at borders due to state-specific travel restrictions imposed to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.A three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan asked the central government to convene a meeting of officials from the three states — all part of NCR — within a week and come up with a common portal to facilitate interstate travel such as the one between Delhi and Noida or Delhi and Gurugram. The court fixed June 12 as the next date of hearing.“...the Government of India shall convene a meeting of concerned state officials/UTs and endeavour to find out a common programme, common portal for easing the interstate movement on all state borders in the National Capital Region. Needful be done within a week,” the bench, which also comprised justices SK Kaul and MR Shah, ordered.Formed in 1985, NCR, which spans 55,083 square kilometres and also includes parts of Rajasthan, was envisaged as a composite area for coordinated urban planning and development, but the lack of coordination among member states have time and again been exposed over the years in critical areas such a pollution control and mobility. In fact, experts blamed officials in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for not working in tandem to prevent the border mess during the lockdown.“The idea [of NCR] was to decongest Delhi and allow integrated development in Delhi and neighbouring cities. Integration of transport was an important component. Instead of taking decisions considering NCR as a whole unit, the district administrations in Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Haryana are working in silos,” AK Jain, former planning commissioner, Delhi Development Authority (DDA), said.State authorities welcomed the Supreme Court directive. “We will implement the orders of the Supreme Court through complete collaboration with our sister states under the aegis of the Union ministry of home affairs,” Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev said.Amit Arya, media adviser to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, said: “We will work with the other state governments on the modalities, and find out a way forward...”While Ajay Shankar Pandey, the Ghaziabad district magistrate, said relevant directions on the issue will come from Uttar Pradesh capital Lucknow, authorities in Noida did not immediately react to the issue.“...Let us go through the observations/orders... [and] let the Centre convene the meeting first...,” a senior government official said in Lucknow on the condition of anonymity.Strict border curbs have hindered movement of commuters in the NCR region ever since the lockdown was first imposed on March 25. What added to the confusion were state-specific rules that, in turn, led to serpentine queues at Noida, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Faridabad borders as the police turned away scores of commuters who did not have necessary permits. For example, Delhi announced sealing its border for at least a week on June 1, two days after the central guidelines on a phased reopening green-lighted interstate travel but pointed out at the same time that state-specific curbs are allowed based on assessment of the ground situation. Though Haryana decided lifting of border restrictions after the Centre’s guidelines, commuters travelling from the national capital to Gurugram and Faridabad were back to square one with Delhi imposing stringent restrictions.In Thursday’s hearing, the petitioner, Rohit Bhalla, a resident of Gurugram, pointed out the troubles commuters were facing at the borders and the confusion among them.He said measures adopted by states were disproportionately impacting citizens in NCR and violating their fundamental rights, including the right to movement under Article 19(1)(d) and the right to carry on with trade or occupation under Article 19(1)(g).Specifically, Bhalla challenged the orders passed by officials in Haryana on April 29 and Uttar Pradesh on May 3.In the April 29 notification, the Gurugram and Sonepat administrations directed residents of these two districts who cross interstate borders to arrange for accommodation outside Haryana, Bhalla said. He also pointed out that the Gautam Budh Nagar administration announced sealing of the Noida border on May 3.“Restricting movement and activities to different extents in different areas falling within the NCR is in complete violation of the Union of India’s new guidelines dated May 1, 2020 which in fact allows movement for permissible activities [such as essential services],” the petitioner said.The absence of a common pass system was another aspect Bhalla pointed out in his petition filed on May 11. Commuters in NCR have to apply for e-passes in state-specific portals.“A person residing in one State, working for gain in another state and falling within permissible limits of the New Guidelines [of May 1], has to apply for passes in both the States and may get accepted by one and rejected in the other due to a complete lack of co-ordination in the said state departments, preventing his fundamental right to practice his profession or commerce in spite of the same being allowed by the New Guidelines,” the petition said.(with inputs from HTC in Noida and Gurugram)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-asks-for-common-mobility-plan-in-ncr/story-EhRV0MFA13G330i1Vq83YI.html
05-06-2020||India||Defence ministry official in home quarantine||A joint secretary-ranked officer in the defence ministry is under home quarantine . He is among the people who came in touch with defence secretary Ajay Kumar who tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday, officials said on Thursday. Kumar, who is under home quarantine, may have come in touch with around 30 people in the four to five days before he tested positive, the officials said. “Only the JS-ranked officer is in the high-risk category and is under quarantine,” they added. Necessary contact tracing of the defence secretary is being carried out to identify people he recently come in contact with, as reported by Hindustan Times on Thursday.Kumar is the first top official to test positive. The chief of defence staff and the three service chiefs have had no direct contact with Kumar in the past four to five days, the officials added.Defence minister Rajnath Singh did not attend office on Wednesday and Thursday as the first floor section of the South Block in which he has his office is being sanitised. Kumar’s office is not too far from the minister’s on the same floor. Several top officials have their offices on the first floor including the army chief, the navy chief and a string of bureaucrats.Meanwhile, in the labour ministry, two officials in the labour secretary’s office have been tested Covid positive, prompting authorities to vacate a section of the Shram Shakti Bhavan, home to several ministries including labour and water. Labour secretary Hiralal Samariya has informed the Parliament’s labour panel that he and other officials can’t depose before the committee on Friday. The panel was scheduled to discuss the issue of migrant workers and the social security code, one of the four new labour codes. More Covid-19 cases surfaced in Shastri Bhawan on Wednesday as Delhi witnesses a steady increase in infections. According to officials, a joint secretary in the law ministry and the driver of a joint secretary in the culture ministry have also tested positive for the highly contagious disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-ministry-official-in-home-quarantine/story-0hDMmZE5b4DzT5FPRBn17L.html
05-06-2020||India||Changing norms hurting testing: Experts||For about a week since her father succumbed to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), 27-year-old Delhi resident Shipra Ujjainwala has made dozens of phone calls to helplines, approached multiple private testing centres, and approached at least one government hospital to be tested for the coronavirus infection. Ujjainwala has no symptoms but she needs a “negative” certificate to get back to work and address the misgivings of her neighbours and relatives who have avoided the family for weeks. “I was refused as I didn’t have prescription from a doctor for I had no symptoms. The fact that I had a Covid death in my family and that my organisation demands a Covid-free certificate was not enough to agree them to test me. Nobody wants to see us because of our Covid positive case history how am I supposed to get a prescription,” she said.Her experience captures the convoluted protocols that make it difficult for even at-risk people to be able to get a Covid-19 test, complicating efforts to determine the size of the outbreak. Till Tuesday, Ujjainwala would have qualified for a test but the rule has now been changed to allow only symptomatic close contacts of a confirmed patient.The number of Covid-19 tests carried per million people in India is a little over 3,100, a number that experts have said is inadequate to determine the true extent of the problem in the country, even as the total infections rose by another nationally. “Our [India’s] condition may be worse than Italy, but we don’t know since we aren’t testing enough. We don’t acknowledge our real status in terms of disease spread because it seems our focus is largely on proving we are doing better than other countries in managing the disease. We have tested about 3.9 million people from a population of 1.3 billion, which is roughly about 0.3% of the population. How can you plan how to control a pandemic for the rest of the 99.7% of the population by merely looking at the results in 0.3% of the population?” said Dr T Jacob John, former virology head, Christian Medical College, Vellore John.The problem is not merely that the rules are restrictive but that they are also changing rapidly. “There is perpetual confusion over who to test, as the government keeps changing guidelines. It feels like harassment and it appears they want private labs to stop testing by making it difficult for us to operate,” said the owner of a private laboratory owner, asking not to be named.Representatives of the Indian Council of Medical Research – the apex body that sets the standards for such protocols across the country (though they can be tweaked by states) – said the changes are due to evolving demands. “ICMR has been time to time revising guidelines as per what the situation demands. The protocols have been clearly laid out that states should follow. Some states are perhaps going by their own rules by making additions or to ICMR protocol that is probably creating problems,” said Dr Rajnikant Srivastava, spokesperson, ICMR.Manufacturers of test kits say they are prepared to meet higher demands. “We are currently producing 2 lakh tests a day; there is absolutely no shortage of kits. I can say for sure that in some time India is going to be a competitive market globally,” said Hasmukh Rawal, managing director, Mylab Discovery Solutions, Pune-based manufacturers of RT-PCR diagnostic kits.Current bottlenecks, however, could be in the labs. “There is no shortage of kits and equipment but there is only a particular number of tests that a laboratory can do, which is the testing capacity of a lab. You cannot go beyond that, no matter how many extra kits you have. It is not possible to test the entire 1.3 billion population,” said Dr Srivastava.Testing will also need to be timed in order to avoid false negatives. Dr RR Gangakhedkar, head, epidemiology division, ICMR, said, “We cannot open up testing for asymptomatic people because a negative RT-PCR test does not rule out infection in the early stages of infection, and in people with low viral load, the chance of RT-PCR returning a false negative is there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/changing-norms-hurting-testing-experts/story-UdzvXa6hVn9dIyoXoePEAP.html
05-06-2020||India||Study links respiratory illness during Covid to blood groups||Blood groups may be a key factor in making people susceptible to developing severe respiratory problems during a Covid-19 infection, according to a study of 1,600 patients in hot spot cities in Italy and Spain that suggested those with blood group A positive were most at risk while those with O were protected to some degree. The study, published on preprint server medRxiv, is yet to be peer reviewed. The researchers carried out a genome-wide association analysis to determine what genes were common among those that developed a severe respiratory illness after being infected by Sars-Cov-2. The researchers detected at least a couple of significant “associations”, including one that “located at the ABO blood group locus and a blood-group-specific analysis showed higher risk for A-positive individuals and a protective effect for blood group O”, they said in the paper. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe ABO blood group locus refers to a set of genes that determine which blood group an individual has.The study could offer scientists more insight into why the disease behaves unpredictably across humans: the symptoms range from being virtually non-existent, resembling a flu, or, in most severe cases, leaving people unable to breathe.  “Respiratory failure is a key feature of severe Covid-19 and a critical driver of mortality, but for reasons poorly defined affects less than 10% of Sars-CoV-2 infected patients,” the researchers said. The variations in symptoms have often defied age and gender trends that largely suggest older men may be more vulnerable to the virus. There have been a significant number of young people who have succumbed to the illness. The study covered 1,610 patients from hot spot cities in Italy and Spain who had developed severe symptoms after contracting the virus. The team of researchers included clinicians at the European Covid-19 epicentres in Italy and Spain and available German and Norwegian scientists. The analysis also used samples from 2,205 blood donors with no evidence of a Covid-19 infection for the genomic comparison.The researchers noted that their findings corroborate publicly available results from the Covid-19 Host Genetics Consortium, where similar associations have been noticed among Covid-19 affected cases versus a population-based sample. The findings in connection with the blood groups also associate with another Covid-19 symptom seen among people who develop serious illness: blood clotting. “Genetic variation at the ABO locus has previously been associated with a number of procoagulant markers such as von Willebrand factor and Factor VIII, and the potential relationship between our genetic findings and the significant coagulopathy that is observed in severe Covid-19 warrants further attention,” the researchers wrote.Genome-wide association studies are among the key strategies researchers deploy to understand a disease. The genome, simply put, determines how a human body is made up at a cellular level and the functions it carries out, whether to make or repair new cells.These findings could help efforts to tailor therapies that at present are only mildly effective in treating Covid-19 patients.“There is usually a strong relationship between blood group and disease. But it is very difficult at this stage to determine this particular correlation unless there is a very huge study,” said Dr RN Makroo, a specialist in molecular biology. “The distribution of blood groups in population also needs to be accounted for,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/study-links-respiratory-illness-during-covid-to-blood-groups/story-ueJNt9ZIDB6h4UGnyCABeI.html
05-06-2020||India||E-cars for ferrying MPs likely in Parliament this monsoon session||From the Monsoon session, only electric cars may be used to ferry lawmakers to and from their homes in Lutyens’ Delhi in a bid to curb air pollution and promote a green culture in Parliament.At a recent meeting with senior officials, Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla asked for a review of the current car usage policy, according to people familiar with the development. Apart from the Lok Sabha secretariat, the government-run India Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) and Energy Efficiency Services Limited (EESL) provide cars in Parliament to ferry members.“During the session, after the adjournment of the House, electric cars may be deployed for dropping off members,” said a note on the meeting that HT has seen.To be sure, members can use their personal or official vehicles to travel to Parliament. According to officials, however, about 60% prefer to use ferry vehicles during the session because of parking limitations in the complex.The use of electric cars has been on the agenda of Parliament officials for a while. Two years ago, a couple of golf carts were purchased to commute within the Parliament estate. During Sumitra Mahajan’s tenure as Speaker (2009-14), a battery-operated minibus was also bought for MPs, but it was only of limited utility because it unsuitable for narrow lanes.Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar uses the only e-car (Hyundai Kona) among the members of Parliament, while another Bharatiya Janata Party MP, Mansukh Mandviya, rides a bicycle to Parliament.The review of the car lease policy comes weeks after the Lok Sabha secretariat decided to curtail costs in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic.The Lok Sabha was allotted ₹811 crore in this year’s general budget, ₹44 crore higher than the revised estimate of ₹766.87 crore in FY 2019-20. But a large part of the money is expected to remain unspent, according to officials. The Rajya Sabha has an annual budget of ₹436 crore.The Upper House, too, has reviewed the vehicles available to it, and is likely to get some e-cars. It was due to buy two new cars after a gap of more than 10 years, and the vehicles were to be given to Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad and deputy chairman Harivansh Narayan Singh.But now, in the aftermath of the Covid-19 crisis, purchase of vehicles may be pushed back, said an official.The Lok Sabha secretariat has also barred entry of its former employees to Parliament complex. The ban is applicable for retired officers below the rank of joint secretary. Officials said the ban is aimed at restricting people in Parliament to reduce the virus threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/e-cars-for-ferrying-mps-likely-in-parliament-this-monsoon-session/story-c4kIkxoZCzSqwyqNZi7VAP.html
05-06-2020||India||PM Modi, Australian PM bolster military ties||India and Australia elevated their ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership and signed a crucial agreement for reciprocal access to military logistics during a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his counterpart Scott Morrison on Thursday.The two sides also upgraded their “2+2” foreign affairs and defence dialogue to the ministerial level and unveiled a “shared vision for maritime cooperation in the Indo- Pacific”.The Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA), one of seven agreements signed during the summit, will facilitate reciprocal access to military logistics facilities, allow for more complex joint military exercises and improve interoperability between the armed forces of the two countries.“India is committed to expanding its relations with Australia in a comprehensive and quick manner. This is important not only for our two countries, but also for the Indo-Pacific region and the world,” Modi said in his opening televised remarks in Hindi.Morrision said the comprehensive strategic partnership formed by the two sides will take them “to a whole new level of relationship” and “continue to build the trust because we want commercial and trading relationships that are built on trust”.Referring to the joint declaration on cooperation in the Indo-Pacific, he added, “We share an ocean and we share responsibilities for that ocean as well – its health, well-being [and] security and the relationship we’re forming around those issues and our maritime domain is the platform for so many other things between our countries.”The summit was held against the backdrop of growing tensions with China for both India and Australia, though secretary (east) Vijay Thakur Singh of the external affairs ministry told an online briefing there was no specific discussion on China.However, many of the items on the agenda – shared democratic values, rules-based multilateral systems, an open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, respect for transparency, strengthening and diversifying supply chains for critical health, technology and other goods and services, and cooperation in rare earth minerals – appeared to be aimed at countering China’s influence in the region, experts said.Modi said the two sides should focus on how their relationship can be a “factor of stability for our region and for the world”, while Morrison said Australia is working with friends such as India and Japan to provide a “steadying and stabilising and wise influence during…an incredibly difficult time”.Morrison said Australia is “committed to an open, inclusive, prosperous Indo-Pacific and India’s role in that region…will be critical”. He added, “We share a vision for open, free, rules-based multilateral systems in our region, whether that’s in the health area or it’s in trade or in other places.”He also tacitly referred to Australia’s demand for a probe into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic while commending India’s taking over as chair of the World Health Organization (WHO)’s executive board.“This is a very important time to be chairing that executive board. I have no doubt the way that that will be led under India’s leadership will be critical to how we deal with many difficult problems that we are encountering globally, particularly in the health area,” Morrison said.Among the other important agreements signed by the two sides during the virtual bilateral summit – the first such meeting for Modi – were a framework arrangement on cyber and cyber-enabled critical technology cooperation, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on cooperation in mining and processing of critical and strategic minerals, and an implementing arrangement on cooperation in defence science and technology under the existing MoU on defence cooperation.Even before the Covid-19 crisis, the two sides had been exploring the possibility of cooperation in mining and processing of rare earth metals such as lithium, neodymium and dysprosium, of which Australia has the world’s sixth largest reserves.Indian officials said Australia is seen as a “reliable and secure supplier” of rare earth metals and institutions from both sides will jointly take forward collaboration in this field.India, which imports more than 90% of the rare earth metals it needs from China, has been looking to diversify sources. In 2016, the imports from China were worth $3.4 million.The two sides also signed three MoUs on cooperation in public administration and governance reforms, cooperation in vocational education and training and water resources management.The virtual summit was arranged after Morrison was forced to put off a planned visit to India twice – first in January because of the devastating bushfires in Australia and then in May because of the Covid-19 crisis. Though the discussions were slated to last 40 minutes, they stretched to 70 minutes and secretary (east) characterised the talks as “extremely productive”.As part of the joint response to the Covid-19 crisis, an allocation will be made from the Australia-India Strategic Research Fund for work in seven areas to counter the pandemic.An Australian statement said the joint declaration on maritime cooperation in the Indo-Pacific committed both sides to supporting rules-based maritime order in the region and working together to strengthen maritime domain awareness and combating trans-national challenges such as people smuggling, arms and narcotics trafficking, terrorism, and illegal and unregulated fishing.The Australian side also said the cooperative arrangement on cyber affairs and critical technology will be complemented by a new, four-year $12.7 million partnership that will create a research and development fund for Indian and Australian businesses and support other countries to improve their cyber resilience.Modi reiterated his invitation to Morrison to visit India when the situation normalises. Morrison, who has met Modi four times in the recent past, joked about how he had missed out on the “famous Modi hug”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-australian-pm-bolster-military-ties/story-EvGK3Yyjn3AopSXKfGbxJJ.html
05-06-2020||India||Govt flattened wrong curve: Rajiv Bajaj to Rahul Gandhi||Stressing on the importance of a stimulus to boost demand, Rajiv Bajaj, managing director of Bajaj Auto, said in a video conversation with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi that the 68-day lockdown to flatten the Covid-19 infection curve ended up flattening the “wrong curve” of the economic growth.He said the lockdown has not been able to check growth of Covid-19, but ended up hurting the economy. “You [the government] flattened the wrong curve. It is not the infection curve, it is the GDP [gross domestic product] curve,” Bajaj told Gandhi.Bajaj was speaking to Gandhi as part of the series of video conversations with global and Indian thought leaders to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences on the country’s economy.According to official data released last week, the economy grew 3.1% in the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 4.2% -- the slowest pace in 11 years -- in the financial year 2019-20. The prolonged nationwide lockdown in the aftermath of the Covid-19 pandemic is expected to dent the growth further.Days after the release of official GDP data, Moody’s Investors Service cut India’s rating by one notch to the lowest investment grade with a negative outlook, citing growing risks that Asia’s third largest economy will face a prolonged period of slower growth.On June 2, while addressing businessmen Prime Minister Narendra Modi voiced confidence in the economy’s ability to return to a path of rapid growth, listing it among his government’s top priorities and pledging its commitment to systematic reforms. ”Yes ! We will definitely get our growth back,” Modi said in his speech to a conference on ‘Getting Growth Back’ organised by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII).The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) dismissed Bajaj’s views and maintained that he is not an expert on Covid-related issues.“This is Rajiv Bajaj’s personal opinion and in India everyone is allowed to have one. The government has said that we brought time to build health infrastructure so that we can open economic activity. Today, we have robust structures to combat Covid-19 spread,” said BJP spokesperson Gopal AgarwalIn the interaction, Bajaj said India’s lockdown strategy was influenced by the West. Despite being an Asian country, India preferred to tackle the situation like the developed West, instead of looking at what was happening in the East. India looked at Italy, France, Spain, UK and the US, which are not really the right benchmarks , he added. Bajaj gave examples of Japan and Sweden, where measures such as sanitisation, masks and social distancing were followed, but where the countries tried to keep the wheels of the economy turning. “I think unfortunately, India not only looked West, it went to the wild west. I think we stayed more towards the impervious side. We tried to implement a hard lockdown which was still porous,” he said.The way India has been locked down is draconian, he said. “This kind of lockdown, I have not heard about from anywhere else,” he added.India lifted many of the restrictions on movement and economic activity on June 1 and has said even more would be opened up by June 8. Bajaj also urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to spell out how the country would move forward after the lockdown is fully lifted, claiming that the unlocking would be anything but smooth.“I am really distressed because it is a herculean task to open up economic activities. The first problem is to get this fear out of the minds of the people. There has to be a very clear aligned narrative from the PM because, whether right or wrong, when he says something people seem to follow,” he said.I think the PM needs to tell everyone, this is how we are going to move forward, he said. “All is under control. Don’t be afraid of the viral infections, only a few people are dying, and we have to move forward now.” Bajaj also mentioned the need for a stimulus to lift the demand and revive the Covid-19 battered economy.“I strongly believe that a large country such as India cannot save itself out of trouble. It has to sell itself out of trouble. We have to get demand going again. We have to provide something that lifts the mood of the people. We need some mood elevators. I don’t understand why there is no strong initiative, even if it is for a period of six months to one year, to strongly lift the mood of the people and provide a stimulus to demand,” Bajaj said.The BJP’s Agarwal said the government‘s focus is now on the economy.

05-06-2020||India||Health ministry issues SOPs for hotels, places of worship||Frequently touched surfaces such as door knobs at hotels must be disinfected regularly, disposable menu cards are recommended at food courts in malls, just 50% seating capacity can be utilised at restaurants, and offerings at religious places will be prohibited for now — these are some of the guidelines released by the health and family welfare ministry on Thursday as part of a three-phased plan aimed at lifting restrictions imposed to halt the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The standard operating procedures (SOPs) came four days ahead of the opening of malls, religious places, and hotels and restaurants in several parts of the country from June 8 in the first phase of what the Centre calls Unlock 1, and gives a glimpse of life in the aftermath of a pandemic. “This is an exhaustive list...that must be followed to help in containing the spread of Covid-19. We are working on some more (guidelines) that should be out in coming days,” said Lav Agarwal, joint secretary, Union health ministry. The list of dos and don’ts has some common themes: physical distancing of at least six feet; mandatory use of face covers; frequent hand washing with soaps (for at least 40-60 seconds); use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers; and covering mouth and nose while sneezing or coughing. Those above 65 years, children below 10 years, persons with underlying health conditions and pregnant women have been advised to stay at home. People have been advised to install and use the Aarogya Setu app. The directive also said temperature setting of all air conditioning devices should be in the range of 24-30 degrees Celsius, and the relative humidity should be in the range of 40-70%.HotelsThe specific guidelines for hotels and hospitality units include thermal screening at the entry; proper crowd management on hotel premises and parking lots; disinfection of car steering, door handles and keys; separate entry and exits for guests, staff and goods/supplies if possible; restriction on the number of people on elevators; and markings for social distancing.Additionally, details of the guest (travel history, medical condition etc.) along with an identity card and a self-declaration form must be provided at the reception. “Hotels must adopt contactless processes like QR code, online forms, digital payments like e-wallet etc. for both check-in and check-out,” the guidelines said, adding that luggage should be disinfected before sending the luggage to rooms. For room service, communication between guests and in-house staff should be through intercom, and room service should be provided while maintaining adequate social distance. Regular disinfection of frequently touched surfaces (door knobs, elevator buttons, hand rails) will be made mandatory, and deep cleaning of all washrooms shall be ensured at regular intervals.Room service or takeaways will be encouraged, instead of dine-in. Food delivery personnel should leave the packet at a guest’s or customer’s door. While disposable menus are recommended, the guidelines favoured the use of good quality disposable paper napkins in place of cloth napkins.Shopping mallsOnly asymptomatic people will be allowed, with a staggered entry system. Any shops, stalls, cafeteria etc. outside and within the premises will have to follow social distancing norms. Gaming arcades, children’s play areas, and cinema halls will remain shut.In food courts, the management will have to ensure adequate crowd management. Staff and waiters should wear masks and hand gloves. Seating arrangement should ensure social distancing. Contactless mode of ordering and digital mode of payment will be encouraged.RestaurantsAll directives for restaurants in hotels and food courts will be applicable. Also, just 50% of the seating capacity of a restaurant must be utilised for dine-in customers. Also, specific markings should be made to manage queues and ensure social distancing when patrons are waiting for a table.Religious places“Shoes or footwear to be preferably taken off inside own vehicle,” the directive said. Touching of statues idols, holy books etc. are not allowed. Large gatherings will continue to remain prohibited.Recorded devotional music and songs recommended, while inviting choirs or singing groups is not advisable.“Avoid physical contact while greeting each other. Common prayer mats should be avoided and devotees should bring their own prayer mat or piece of cloth which they may take back with them,” said the guidelines. Physical offerings such as prasad distribution or sprinkling of holy water are not allowed. Community kitchens/langars will have to follow social distancing. OfficesStaff living in containment zones will not attend office, which are already functioning unlike malls and religious places. Such staff should be permitted to work from home, and it will not be counted as leave period. The issuance of visitors’ or temporary passes is suspended, and those with proper permission should be allowed to meet an officer after being properly screened. Meetings through video conferencing are advised.“The next stage of transmission can be managed only if we can adopt an approach similar to that of Japan, which focused on ‘3 Cs’ that denote high-risk places and situations — closed spaces, crowded places, close-contact settings. The confluence of these three together accentuates the risk in closed places such as religious places,” said Giridhara Babu, head, life course epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-issues-sops-for-hotels-places-of-worship/story-s15hokptNvY1ZsWc9ke8vO.html
05-06-2020||India||Covid-19 fallout: NCR remains a concept on paper, as states act in silos||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has exposed the deficiencies in the concept of the National Capital Region (NCR) envisaged in 1985 for coordinated urban development in and around Delhi so that there could be seamless mobility, quality housing, and shared infrastructure, say multiple experts in planning and administration.Over the past month, three of the principal state administrations that make up NCR -- Delhi, UP and Haryana -- have sealed and unsealed borders at will, failed to share or pool health care infrastructure, and not tried to evolve a common strategy in the face of rising Covid-19 cases. Delhi, which has reported 25,004 cases till Thursday, sealed its borders to restrict the number of patients coming in for treatment on Tuesday, just as Noida and Gurugram, which had sealed their borders for weeks despite Delhi letting commuters in, were ready to ease curbs on intercity movement. Noida had 543 cases, while Gurugram reported 1,410 infections by Thursday. This lack of coordination forced the Supreme Court on Thursday to order the Centre to convene a meeting of member states – Delhi, UP, Haryana and Rajasthan – in order to evolve a “common programme and common portal” for easing interstate movement in the National Capital Region.  The way the concept was developed, however, such a situation was never meant to happen.Capital expansionNCR was constituted due to a spurt in population growth in the region since 1951, largely due to migration resulting in congestion and shortage of civic amenities, as per the National Capital Region Planning Board (NCRPB). The aim was primarily to decongest Delhi, and the region came into being in 1985 under the NCRPB. In the 1990s, with the emergence of Noida (New Okhla Industrial Development Authority) and Gurugram, the urban growth accelerated at breakneck speed. What used to be agricultural fields on the Capital’s outskirts became the hubs of industry, offices, and housing.With almost invisible borders, Noida carried the promise of affordable housing and easy commute to and from Delhi. “Noida offered all than an upper-middle class person aspires for. The authority planned at least 150 residential plotted areas and at least 600 group housing colonies in view of high demand,” said Rajpal Kaushik former chief architect and urban town planner of Noida Authority. While Noida was redefining urban growth on the eastern border of the Capital, business was booming in Gurugram (then Gurgaon) located on its southern border with home-grown carmaker Maruti setting up its plant in the 1980s. Gurugram, a village till then, had vast swathes of barren land and minimal local government. Sensing the potential for industrial and urban growth, private builders such as DLF and Ansal consolidated large tracts of land and soon world class residential condominiums and office spaces sprung up across Gurugram, earning it the tag of “Millennium City”.Proximity to the Capital and the IGI airport, a large inventory of office space, and the economic liberalisation in the 1990s enabled Gurugram to attract corporate houses, both domestic and multinational, IT companies, BPOs, and Fortune 500 companies to set up base in the city, spurring growth and opportunities. Several industrialists from other Haryana cities such as Hisar, Bhiwani and Jhajjar also came to Gurugram to set up their base, making Udyog Vihar and Manesar industrial hubs.“The National Capital Region is seen as a single economic and social unit where people move seamlessly while working in one corner or city and living in another part. It is also one of the largest integrated economic and social corridors in the world. It attracts the best talent, top corporates who want to work and live here. Real-estate growth has happened to a great extent because of economic growth and opportunities offered by a seamless NCR, which has common ethos and culture. It important to ensure people move with ease in this region,” said Akash Ohri, senior executive director, DLF.While Noida and Gurugram owe their growth mostly to the economic liberalisation, Ghaziabad in UP and Faridabad in Haryana has been traditional industrial powerhouses of the two states. Today, NCR comprises Delhi and 23 districts from UP, Haryana and Rajasthan and is spread over 55,083 square km. However, the administrative integration has remained largely on paper, with member states working in silos and often sparring over issues such as water sharing, mobility and pollution. A case in point is the fact that the region is yet to evolve a common mobility solution with no reliable public transport, except Metro, to commute across the cities of Delhi, Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram. Mobility issuesDespite existing as a massive urban conglomerate, there was no common, reliable public transport in the region before the Delhi Metro came up. Delhi operates nearly 100 buses for Gurugram, Noida and Bahadurgarh, but Haryana and UP roadways buses can’t enter Delhi since they run on diesel, which is banned for public transport in the city since 1998, when the switch to CNG was made. Public transport between NCR cities involving para transit vehicles is even more restricted. As against the 95,000 registered auto-rickshaws in Delhi, only 10,000 have permits to ply from Delhi to NCR cities and vice versa. Delhi transport minister Kailash Gahlot said the Capital has put in place some of the “most relaxed norms” for transport vehicles coming from other states. “But we do not get the same treatment from them. For example, we charge no passenger taxes on any bus coming from Haryana or any other adjoining state. But DTC buses have to pay extra passenger tax on routes such as Gurugram or Bahadurgarh. We run the buses despite the high passenger tax which in turn, makes the ticket quite expensive. Since long, we have been demanding abolition of passenger tax so that public transport becomes cheap and affordable and more and more public uses public transport,” he said.The recent sealing of borders because of Covid-19 has only added to the chaos. The Regional Plan-2021, the second plan prepared by NCRPB, mentions the formation of a unified metropolitan or regional transport authority for NCR. “But the plan has remained on paper. It was to ensure better coordination between various government authorities in the NCR for seamless connectivity and movement of commuters. If this authority was in place, the problems we are facing today would have been easily addressed,” said PK Sarkar, member of the technical committee of NCRPB. According to a senior NCRPB official, there is a committee of transport secretaries chaired by NCRPB’s member secretary which takes up issues related to better coordination between member states. “But the committee has not met during the Covid-19 crisis. There has been no request either from the member states in this regard. All state governments are taking decisions as per their local situation,” said the official, requesting anonymity. Urban transport experts say that some of the provisions mentioned in the Regional Plan-2021, such as Regional rail Transport (RRTS), development of peripheral expressways (Eastern and Western peripheral expressways), expressway between Ghaziabad and Meerut, expansion of Metro network etc. have been implemented.Sarika Panda Bhatt, a transportation expert based in Gurugram, pointed out that there is a common transport agreement which allows unrestricted movement of vehicles between these states. “But as it would appear, such reciprocal gestures do not apply during a pandemic,” she said, pointing out the lack of a coordinated approach during a crisis. A second senior official in the NCRPB, who asked not to be named, said: “NCRPB is merely a facilitator, and we cannot enforce any regulations. It is up to the states to accommodate each other’s challenges. But now we are facing a storm, so everyone has shut their doors and windows to keep themselves safe.” Satish Mahana, UP’s industry minister said, “As far as the Supreme Court direction on borders is concerned, the state government will take appropriate decision on it…To ensure that office goers or factory workers don’t face any problem in commuting our government has directed Gautam Budh Nagar or Ghaziabad to issue passes.”Haryana transport minister Mool Chand Sharma said the government is aware of problems being faced by the people. “An industrialist in Faridabad has a factory in Gurugram and transports his goods to Delhi. We can see that people are being inconvenienced. I will speak with the chief minister before taking discussions forward. We have to find a solution that balances protection of both life and livelihood.” Pollution politics Every year when the air pollution goes up in the winter months, so does the blame game between NCR states. While Delhi maintains that crop residue burning by farmers in Haryana and Punjab accounts for a bulk of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) pollutants in Delhi’s air, the governments of the two states fault Delhi for not doing enough to curb other sources of pollution in the capital. Despite pollution posing a major health emergency for millions, the states are yet to reach a consensus on a common approach and collaborate to tackle the problem.Now, the Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention & Control) Authority (EPCA) regulates and enforces measures under the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) across NCR. While referring to the challenges posed by the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease, Sunita Narain, member of EPCA, said the administrations which constitute NCR should go back and remember how they have together tackled air pollution in the past few years, “NCR is completely interlinked in terms of movement and the air-shed is one. At EPCA, we found that the only way to deal with it was cooperation. There were a lot of times NCR cities such as Gurugram and Bhiwadi came to us questioning why we were locking them down as well under the graded response action plan, despite their pollution levels being fairly lower than Delhi. But, we didn’t allow any compromise and it worked only because the entire plan was executed as NCR as a whole,” Narain said. What is currently happening is not the way to go, she added. “It is like drawing borders between states right now and it feels like we are drawing international borders. We have been pushing for augmentation of public transport among NCR cities because there is massive to and for Delhi from the neighbouring cities,” Narain said. Water woesPolitics, protest and posturing have dominated on the issue of sharing water of the Yamuna between Delhi and Haryana. Delhi depends on the Yamuna for most of its water needs and blames the Haryana government for not allowing its share of water to flow in the Munak canal – the main water supply tributary to Delhi. Haryana, on the other hand, alleges that Delhi wants Haryana to part with its share of water. The two states are locked in a legal battle over the issue and the courts have time and again directed the two states to reach a negotiated settlement.(With inputs from Vinod Rajput in Noida; Prayag Arora Desai and Abhishek Behl in Gurugam)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-crisis-ncr-remains-a-concept-on-paper-as-states-act-in-silos/story-esOCVDHWpSDeEkXUKEgPXI.html
05-06-2020||India||14 quakes in 2 months may not lead to a big one in NCR||Wednesday night’s minor tremor in Noida was the fourteenth (14th) to hit Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR) over the past two months, but the increased frequency may not necessarily indicate a major one is coming, say seismologists. Still, monitoring them is key to being prepared , they add. Scientists at the National Centre for Seismology (NCS) underlined that earthquakes cannot be forecast and the only thing to do is to be aware of the activities in vulnerable pockets such as the Delhi region. Only two of the 14 tremors have been above magnitude 3.5, according to NCS data. “While these [minor earthquakes] may be because of activity in the local faults, we have to remember that north Delhi is close to the Himalayan belt where the Indian plate is subducting under the Eurasian plate. That region is seismically very active. We need to monitor even these small earthquakes critically because we do not know how much energy is there and how much has been released through these small events,” said Kalachand Sain, who heads the Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology. Subducting is the process by which one tectonic plate moves under another. “We really need to understand the subsurface scenario now. Occasionally great earthquakes can happen and so we need to build infrastructure and buildings accordingly.”Any major earthquake in the Himalayan belt can also impact Delhi and NCR. A P Pandey, an NCS seismologist, said there have been numerous small earthquakes in Delhi and Haryana over the past three years and that a few have been above magnitude 4. “There are many faults and fissures in this region which could be active. In the past three years, there have been numerous small earthquakes in this region. Luckily, we did not see a much bigger earthquake …we are close to the Himalayas. The Himalayan plate is moving in the north-northeast direction and subducting beneath the Eurasian plate. So, there is a lot of energy along weak zones which are sometimes released through fissures and lineaments.”A fissure is a crack or a fracture ; a lineament is a linear feature corresponding to a fault -- such as a valley or a mountain range. He added the small earthquakes since April have been along lineaments. “Only the one with 4.5 magnitude was along the juncture of the Mahendergarh and Delhi-Sargoda faults. It is good that energy or stress is being released through these lineaments. Otherwise, there can be a big release which can cause widespread damage.” The Himalayas are vulnerable to major earthquakes of over magnitude 8.“Nobody can say when or where this energy will be released. So, it is best to be prepared. We have, however, identified vulnerable pockets,” Pandey said.NCS head (operations) J L Gautam said it is not abnormal to record so many earthquakes within a couple of months in the Delhi-NCR region “There are a number of small faults in this region. The earthquake last [Wednesday] night was in Uttar Pradesh in Gautam Buddha Nagar. There is the Mathura fault, Moradabad fault, Delhi-Haridwar ridge, Delhi-Sargoda fault, Mahendergarh and Dehradun fault. So, small earthquakes happen in this area. It is not abnormal. That does not mean we cannot expect a big earthquake.”According to Indian Institute of Science’s seismic hazard mapping in 2004, the terrain of Delhi is flat in general except for the NNE-SSW trending ridge. “This is one of the prominent features of Delhi. This is considered as an extension of the Aravalli hill, which is buried under the Yamuna alluvium in the northern parts of Delhi. River Yamuna, which is another prominent feature of Delhi, enters the city from the north and flows southward with an eastern bend near Okhla. This path forms a tri-junction with the Lahore-Delhi ridge and the Delhi-Haridwar ridge. This region is seismically active and shows sporadic activity aligned in NNE-SSW direction, nearly perpendicular to the Himalayan arc. Proximity of Himalayan region makes Delhi susceptible to the earthquakes from Himalayan seismic sources also."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/14-quakes-in-2-months-may-not-lead-to-a-big-one-in-ncr/story-IPhCEe4AKL67G4URHzZe4H.html
05-06-2020||India||Delhi home isolation cases monitored from Bangalore||Around 100 people armed with a phone – most sitting in the comfort of their homes in Bangalore – are helping the Delhi government monitor the health of around 9,500 Covid-19 patients who are presently in home isolation in the capital.With the rising number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Delhi, the Union health ministry came up with guidelines for home isolation at the end of April. The challenge was to ensure that the symptoms of the patients confined to their homes did not worsen. Initially, district officials called those under home isolation in their areas each day to check on their health. To ease their workload, the Delhi government contracted the Bangalore-based home healthcare company Portea Medical on April 30.Once a person tests positive, a two-member district health team visits him or her at home to check their symptoms and the facilities available for home isolation. Only those with mild symptoms such as low-grade fever or sore throat and no comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart and kidney disease are allowed to remain in home isolation. Comorbid conditions are known to increase the risk of a person developing severe symptoms of Covid-19. Even then, home isolation will only be allowed if the patients have adequate facilities such as a separate room and toilet for the person who tests positive for the infection. And if the others in the family do not have severe comorbidities.“Once we get the numbers of the people who have been advised home isolation, our team calls them up to check what their symptoms are – whether they have fever, any uneasiness, who all are living with them. All this data gets recorded. After that, our team calls them up once everyday to check how they are doing,” said Meena Ganesh, chief executive officer of Portea.The dos and don’ts are communicated over the telephone during the first two days.“It is essential to thoroughly explain these things to each patient and the caregiver. There can be queries and confusion. For instance, the caregiver has to take the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine – 400 mg twice a day on day 1 followed by one tablet every week for three weeks. Most people do not know about the dosage. They need to be explained in an organised way – like the way a doctor usually does when medicines are prescribed. These are areas where the professionalism of the consultant helps,” a Delhi government official said.The patients are provided a number on which they can call in case they have any problems.“When we receive a call from the patients, there are two things that we can do. One, we can provide consultation from a Delhi government-empanelled doctor on our portal. The doctor already has access to the information that we have collected over the days. Two, if the doctor thinks that there is a need for intervention, then the team gets in touch with the health officials in Delhi,” Ganesh said.They coordinate with the district surveillance teams and medical staff under the government’s health department to ensure that the patient is moved to a hospital.“From what we have seen so far, only about 7% of those who have been put under home isolation need to be moved to a hospital. The rest can recover on their own at home,” Ganesh said.The team follows the person who tests positive for the coronavirus for 17 days of home isolation, after which they are considered to have recovered.During the spell in home isolation, the patients must wear a triple-layer mask at all times and discard it after eight hours of use or when visibly dirty or moist. The mask has to be disinfected using 1% hypochlorite solution. The caregiver also has to wear a triple-layer mask when in the same room as the patient and use disposable gloves when handling the infected person.The caregiver must also avoid contact with contaminated items such as cigarettes, eating utensils, dishes, drinks, used towel and bed linen used by the patient, according to the government’s home isolation guidelines. Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Thursday again urged people with mild symptoms to stay at home so that hospital beds may remain free for those with moderate to severe symptoms in need of hospitalisation..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-home-isolation-cases-monitored-from-bangalore/story-M022DjGdDPBqyoV11FT2xL.html
05-06-2020||India||Bombay HC asks centre to clarify if Covid-19 can be transmitted by inadvertent touch||A division bench of the Bombay High Court on Thursday sought to know from a government expert committee if Covid-19 could be transmitted through an inadvertent touch or is transmitted through droplets, while hearing a petition alleging violation of government mandated social distancing norms on flights operated by Air India to bring stranded Indians back under the Vande Bharat mission.The division bench of justices SJ Kathawalla and SP Tavade asked the expert committee, headed by the Secretary, Ministry of Civil Aviation for the clarification after taking note of the minutes of a meeting held by the expert committee on May 26 to review and further strengthen the public health related protocols of air travel.The minutes of the meeting which was present before the court read, “The physical distance between two persons helps in minimising the transmission through an inadvertent touch. It was also suggested that if the person sitting adjacent to another person is provided with a protective suit (like a gown covering the upper part of the body and gloves), this can also be very good means of preventing the spread of virus either by droplets or by touch.”The committee’s note further listed the benefits of protective gowns in minimising the risk of transmission through an inadvertent touch while in the aircraft or while boarding or alighting.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The bench was hearing a petition filed by Air India pilot Deven Kanani who had complained that the national carrier had violated social distancing norms while repatriating stranded Indians on special Vande Bharat flights.In the last hearing, the court had asked the centre for data of international evacuees who were Coved-19 negative before boarding the flights but turned positive after alighting from the flight in India.The centre in its response submitted that only 227 passengers, out of the 58,867 flown in from abroad through the Vande Bharat special flights to 17 cities, tested positive for the virus, which is just .38 per cent. However, the data did not provide details of Covid positive passengers found at Delhi, Mumbai and Hyderabad airports, despite 18,896 passengers having landed in 162 flights at these airports.The centre on its part submitted that the 227 passengers, who were Covid negative before boarding the flights, had tested positive during institutional quarantine and hence there was no proof to corroborate if they had contracted the infection on the flight.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe petitioner’s advocates Abhilash and Jyoti Panickar informed the court that the data provided by the centre proved that the petitioner’s apprehensions, on the possibility of the virus spreading on Vande Bharat flights due to non-maintenance of social distancing norms, were right.Panickar claimed that the lives of passengers had been put to risk by Air India by not keeping a seat vacant between two passengers. He said that the national average of Covid -19 infection was 0.16 per cent compared to 0.56 per cent among people who had travelled by Air India to 14 cities and had tested positive for the virus.On its part, Air India, through senior advocate Darius Khambatta, and advocates Dr Abhinav Chandrachud, Arsh Misra and Kavita Anchan informed the bench that the air quality within the aircrafts was similar to that in operation theatres as the air was filtered through Hepa Filters and hence the apprehensions of the petitioner were unfounded.The union of India through solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Anil Singh submitted that the number of Covid positive passengers came to light after they were tested while in mandatory institutional quarantine, hence it was difficult to ascertain whether the virus was contracted on flight.They further reiterated the expert committee recommendation that if proper precautions were taken and the passenger on the middle seat was provided with personal protective equipment (PPE) like face shield and wrap around gown, it would negate the chances of the spread of the virus even through an inadvertent touch. The matter has been posted for further hearing on June 5.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-asks-centre-to-clarify-if-covid-19-can-be-transmitted-by-inadvertent-touch/story-yGQp0G6iCLoK8i3Dl8kG6O.html

The state had recorded 1000 cases on May 29, almost two months after the first case was detected on March 31. But it took just 6 days for that figure to double and cross the 2000 figure mark. Return of over 2.5 lakh persons to the state from all over the country since ban on inter-state movement was lifted on May 4 and domestic flights resumed on May 25 are reasons for the spike in positive cases. According to official estimates, nearly 1,800 of the total cases in Assam are of people who came from other states by roads, railways and air. Till Thursday evening, 443 patients had recovered, 4 had died, 1539 are undergoing treatment and 3 migrated back to their states before recovery. The state has ramped up testing facilities considerably to test swab samples of all those coming back to the state. Till Thursday 133029 samples were tested at the seven authorized government laboratories in the state. Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said recently that the state now has a capacity to test nearly 10,000 samples daily and by June 15 around 2 lakh samples would be tested. The state has a policy of mandatory testing of all those who are returning to the state. All returnees are required to undergo a total 14 days of mandatory quarantine—including institutional and home.Swabs of returnees are taken before they enter institutional quarantine. Once their test results come in 3-4 days, they are allowed to go home and spend the rest of the 14 days in isolation if the test results come negative. The state has 3,338 isolation beds, 595 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 398 ventilators to treat critically ill patients in government and private hospitals. The state has several mass quarantine facilities where over 27,000 persons can be kept.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-s-covid-19-positive-cases-zoom-from-1000-to-nearly-2000-in-just-6-days/story-wDXZ6MQGEgNcChEv91BNcI.html
05-06-2020||India||Health ministry shuts down office for 2 days after around dozen test Covid-19 positive||The Union ministry of health will be shut for two days to disinfect the premises after around a dozen people tested positive for coronavirus (Covid-19) in Nirman Bhawan. Nirman Bhawan, which houses the ministry of health, ministry of power, and ministry of urban affairs, among others, will be disinfected on June 6 and 7.“Many cases are being reported and we don’t know where these cases are coming from. A lot of people are at risk; we heard a driver was infected and since carpooling is happening these days, the other four people sitting in the car also contracted the infection. That’s probably why it was thought to disinfect the building,” said an official, who did not wish to be identified.It is unlikely that the ministry’s health briefings are going to get affected. The ministry also issued preventive guidelines among its staff for strict compliance that includes wearing of masks, entry of only asymptomatic people inside the premises, no loitering of employees in corridors, staggered work hours, and strictly avoiding group lunches.“… to say that the number of Covid positive cases is going up steadily and many officers of the ministry have been tested Covid-19 positive. It has been noticed that at times social distancing is not being maintained in office premises. Hence, all official/staff are advised to take the precautionary measures strictly in order to contain spread of Covid-19,” said the office memo.While people with flu-like illness have been prohibited from entering the office building, those who had given their samples for Covid-19 testing are supposed to inform the administration and not report to work till the result is out.Stairs should be used as far as possible, and not more than four people should take the lift at a time. “..inside the lift persons should be facing the walls of the lift and not facing each other,” the directive says.Common areas such as handrails, lift, doorknobs, stairs, washrooms etc. are being sanitized thrice a day.“As much as possible all employees should avoid using other employees’ phones, desks, offices, or other work tools and equipment. Clean and disinfect them before and after use.” Spitting has also been strictly prohibited within the office premises, and strict action will be taken against those found flouting the norms.Another point that finds mention is that all employees should strictly avoid spreading of rumors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-shuts-down-office-for-2-days/story-7Z4bUUt5YB0mhPe0N1IHRP.html
05-06-2020||India||‘Justice will prevail’: Kerala CM on elephant’s death||Some people suspected to have fed a cracker-filled fruit that caused the death of a pregnant elephant in Kerala have been identified, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Thursday even as activists pointed out it was not the state’s first such killing and the Centre took “a serious note” of the incident.“Justice will prevail,” Vijayan tweeted amid an outpouring of grief over visuals that showed the elephant dead in a river. “Many of you have reached out to us. We want to assure you that your concerns will not go in vain.”The incident came to light on May 27 when a forest officer wrote a Facebook post describing the elephant’s painful death. Union environment and forest minister promised to investigate the case properly. “Central Government has taken a very serious note of the killing of an elephant in Mallapuram, #Kerala. We will not leave any stone unturned to investigate properly and nab the culprit(s). This is not an Indian culture to feed fire crackers and kill,” he tweeted.Kerala’s principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife), Surendra Kumar, said it was unlikely that someone will offer cracker-filled pineapple to a wild elephant. “It is possible that the animal ate the fruit by mistake. Cracker-laden fruits like pineapples are kept by farmers to scare away animals from their fields. Investigation is on to find whether the death was caused by pineapple or jiggery and samples are being tested,” he said. Palakkad district forest officer K K Sunil Kumar said they have started their investigation and will question people living around forests in the area. “We have some leads,” he added without offering further details. Another female elephant was killed in Kollam after it ate a cracker-filled fruit in April. In 2018, another jumbo was killed in Idukki after swallowing jaggery-coated explosives.“In the Kollam case also, the dead jumbo’s mouth, tongue and a part of trunk were burnt. We usually call such snares as boar crackers as they are normally meant to target crop-raiding wild boars. At times, elephants and bears also fall prey to such snares,” said E K Eswaran, a former chief veterinary officer. Kollam farmer K K Mathew said animals damage their farms and at times they use small crackers to scare them. “Some of them dodge electric fencing to attack farms. We have to fend for ourselves. So we resort to such tricks,” said Mathew. John Peruvanthanam, an activist, said people often encroach upon forests and start cultivation there. “It is not like a border between two countries. It is natural for animals to stray into human habitats.”The latest elephant death has put a spotlight on the human-animal conflict in the state. In 2018-19, 24 people were killed by wild elephants and 12 died in tiger attacks, according to the forest department statistics.In 2015, the government proposed to provide licensed firearms to farmers to shoot down wild boars but the proposal was withdrawn after opposition from the forest department that argued they can be misused.Kerala has the third highest population of elephants after Karnataka and Assam even as their numbers declined from 6,177 in 2012 to 5,706 in 2018 when the last census was held..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/justice-will-prevail-kerala-cm-on-elephant-s-death/story-ek6EMiSYFVddaUa6zyI7iP.html
05-06-2020||India||Sixth mass extinction threat grows, 515 species may vanish soon: Study||A recent analysis of data has warned of an acceleration in the sixth mass extinction. For the analysis published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences on June 1, scientists examined available data related to 29,400 species of terrestrial vertebrates and found that 1.7% of them, or 515 species of mammals, birds, amphibians, reptiles, have fewer than 1,000 individuals each and are on the brink of extinction including in India.Among those facing extinction, 243 (47%) are continental and 272 (53%) insular (island-dwelling). Most of them are from South America, followed by Oceania, Asia, Africa, North and Central America, and then Europe with less than 1% of them. The greatest numbers of mammals on the brink extinction are in Asia and Oceania. Most such birds live in South America and Oceania. The distribution of species on the brink extinction shows they also include those in the biodiversity hotspots of the Himalayas and the Western Ghats.Indian experts said the analysis should drive home the message that India can help secure the hotspots and more species from going extinct. “Many of the results are a re-emphasis of the threats to species and processes, but I think the timing of this paper is most important given the [Covid-19] lockdown. ...the authors acknowledge biodiversity is crucial to human and ecosystem resilience, but in the Indian context, we are seeing environmental governmental decisions that are contrary to what scientists are calling for the world over,” said Nandini Velho, a conservation biologist.Scientists like Velho have over the past three months raised concerns over a hydropower project in biodiversity-rich Dibang Valley and the National Wildlife Board’s approval to coal mining inside Assam’s Dehing Patkai Elephant Reserve.Velho said of the 515 species, forest owlet in Central India, Nilgiri marten (Western Ghats), Bugun liocichla (Arunachal Pradesh), Bengal florican (Assam), great Indian bustard (northwest India), white-winged wood duck (northeast India) will disappear soon.“The findings of this paper are similar to the findings of the intergovernmental science policy platform on biodiversity and ecosystem services, which suggests that species are on the verge of extinction which will also lead to larger collapses. In India this is specially pertinent as we have species that are naturally or historically low in number. And a wide range of factors are interacting with them. Several Indian species are mentioned in the paper. The Kolar-leaf nosed bat, named in this paper is found in only one cave in Kolar. If the stigma against bats due to fake covid spreads, the entire population could be made extinct. And the Great Indian Bustard is threatened by increasing transmission lines in Kutch, Gujarat. The White-bellied Heron has less than ten known individuals in India. and its habitat is threatened by submergence by proposed dams like Demwe in Arunchal Pradesh,” said Neha Sinha of the Bombay Natural History Society.National Autonomous University of Mexico and Stanford University scientists led the analysis based on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species and Birdlife International database. The analysis said in view of the current extinction crisis and the lack of widespread actions to halt it, it is very important that scientists “should metaphorically take to the streets”. This is because the current mass extinction is happening at a far larger scale and more rapidly than those recorded in the past.“Thousands of populations of critically endangered vertebrate animal species have been lost in a century, indicating that the sixth mass extinction is human-caused and accelerating. The acceleration of the extinction crisis is certain because of the still fast growth in human numbers and consumption rates. In addition, species are links in ecosystems, and, as they fall out, the species they interact with are likely to go also. In the regions where disappearing species are concentrated, regional biodiversity collapses are likely occurring,” the analysis said.The analysis also shows that those pushed to the brink of extinction have lost their historic geographic range. Assuming that an average mammal or bird population occupies 10,000 km2, it suggests that during the last two centuries, around 3,600 populations of the 48 mammal species and 2,930 populations of the 29 bird species examined have disappeared. Those mammal and bird species have lost around 95% and 94% of their geographic range since 1900, according to the analysis.It said such major losses of populations and species will destroy the ecosystem, goods, and services, which will impact human well being while citing the example of Covid-19. The analysis said the pandemic is linked to wildlife trade and has recommended a strict ban on it in China, Vietnam, Indonesia, and other Asian countries. It has suggested that food be made available to the poor in Africa to prevent dependence on bushmeat. “There is no doubt that there will be more pandemics if we continue destroying habitats and trading wildlife for human consumption as food and traditional medicines,” the analysis said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sixth-mass-extinction-threat-grows-515-species-may-vanish-soon-study/story-2IUPa6dS8ogz1LckmqVxdJ.html
05-06-2020||India||I am deeply sorry for pain I’ve caused to Jessica Lal’s family, says Manu Sharma||Manu Sharma, 43, who was handed a life sentence for the 1999 murder of model Jessica Lal and was released from Tihar Jail this week, spoke to Prawesh Lama about the incident, life behind bars, the lessons he learnt during his incarceration, his NGO, and his future plans, among other things. Edited excerpts:How do you look back at the 17 years you spent in prison?Going to jail is one of the most difficult and scary things that can happen to anyone. I was a 23-year-old and going about my work and life. And one day, I suddenly woke up to the clanging sound of iron gates for a roll call at 5am. I found myself hauled up and paraded for a head count. The most difficult task of the day was probably using the toilets, since there are just five toilets for more than 500 inmates. A bucket of water was a luxury. You face a number of hardships in Tihar, but in time you learn to live with them. What is harder to get accustomed to is the isolation and a lack of knowledge of your family’s welfare.The constant vigil that one has to maintain to protect oneself from the ruffians who rule the inside of the jails is mind-numbing. They can come at you at any time. When you sleep in a barrack -- as I did for quite a few of my earlier years -- you have to be constantly alert, even at night. That is the easiest time for them to attack. However, in my latter years when I was more used to jail life, I tried to spend my time in more constructive ways. My first assignment was to tend to the gardens and that gave me a lot of peace and tranquillity. Thereafter, I was asked to work in the Tihar jail factory, and I can say today that my 10 years spent in the factory helped keep my sanity. I tried to keep myself immersed in the work so as to stay away from the negativity of the jail environment. I also tried to read as much as possible and completed my degree in human rights and studied law as well.In the last 21 years I have learned a lot of hard lessons and I hope and pray that they will help me as I strive for betterment in my life after prison.How do you look back at that night and the events that followed?I was a young 23-year-old boy. I never intended anyone any harm, and am very sorry for what happened. During this time, the toughest part by far was seeing my parents suffer. I feel the suffering I faced was nothing compared to what I saw in their eyes. I feel really sorry for what they had to go through for no fault of theirs. I am really thankful to God that this ordeal has come to an end after 21 long years.What have you learnt from the mistake you made that night? To be grateful to God for the second chance that I have been given and to my family and friends for standing by me.Jail officers credit you for some good initiatives in the prison’s factory that helped the jail earn profits and reach out to a larger audience. Your comments.When in jail, you are allotted work, and I was allotted to the jail factory. I tried to do the work assigned to me as diligently as possible. I can proudly say we were able to take the turnover of the jail factory and increase it from Rs 1 crore to Rs 32 crore and were also able to give work and wages to more than 600 inmates from just 70 earlier. Now that you are a free man after 21 years, what are your plans? Going forward, I hope and believe that I will be able to live a peaceful and fruitful life where I can support my family and carry on helping the unseen and unheard children of jail inmates, who are not currently being provided the means and aid that they require.Jail officers say your NGO, Siddharth Vashishta Trust, helped in the rehabilitation of prisoners and their families. Will you continue this work?I hope to not just continue the work we are doing now but also improve and do more for the children and families of the prisoners. I would like to highlight their suffering, not just in Delhi where we have been working, but across the nation, so that these children are given the acknowledgement and help that they deserve. I hope to help them gain the skills and support that they require to be independent and stand on their own two feet as responsible citizens. I learnt a lot in the last 21 years and my eyes were opened to some truly harsh realities. What do you say to some people on social media, who say you should not have been released?I have served my time and done my best to be the best person I could be and will continue to do so. I hope people are able to recognize this and allow me to proceed with my life.Jessica Lal’s sister Sabrina had earlier written to the Tihar authorities that she had forgiven you for what happened that night. Your comments on this.I have no words to express my sincere gratitude to Sabrina and her family. I am deeply sorry for the pain I have caused them. I am eternally grateful for their magnanimity.What would you say to a young Manu Sharma of 1999? What would you tell him about life?Life can change in a minute, don’t take anything for granted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-am-deeply-sorry-for-the-pain-i-have-caused-the-lal-family-manu-sharma/story-bf1wQPtlDdJqnX4IH0nc4N.html
05-06-2020||India||Hectic parleys in Congress, BJP for Karnataka RS berths||Venkatesha Babu and Smriti Kak RamachndranWith four members of the Rajya Sabha retiring this month, the race to replace them has intensified in Karnataka. Potential candidates from both national parties – the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress-- are lobbying their party leaderships for nominations to the Upper house Two Congress members – B K Hariprasad and Prof M V Rajeev Gowda -- are due to retire on June 25 along with the BJP’s Prabhakar Kore and D Kupendra Reddy of the Janata Dal (Secular) when their terms end.Given the current composition in the 224-member Karnataka assembly, where the BJP has 117 MLAs, the Congress 68 , JDS 34 and independents three (two seats are vacant), the BJP can have two Rajya Sabha MPs elected and the Congress one – but with extra votes to spare -- and the JDS, if it manages additional votes, one.For election to the Rajya Sabha from Karnataka, a member would require 44 votes. So the BJP can comfortably have t two members elected, with votes to spare. Kore, an education baron, is keen for another term, but the BJP is unlikely to nominate him, given that he has already has served two consecutive terms. Tejaswini, the wife of late former Union minister Ananth Kumar who narrowly missed out on the Bangalore South Lok Sabha seat won by her husband for six consecutive terms, is considered to be a key contender.Ramesh Katti, the brother of BJP’s eight-term MLA Umesh Katti, has publicly declared that chief minister BS Yediyurappa should keep his promise of sending him to the Upper house. “I have urged the CM to fulfil his promise of (sending me to the RS) he made last year when I was denied the Chikkodi Lok Sabha ticket,” Katti told HT. A lesser known name doing the rounds as a potential candidate is of Prof M Nagaraj, known as a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh(RSS) ideologue from the northern Karnataka stronghold of the BJP. The BJP state-in-charge Muralidhara Rao himself is seen as a contender for one of the Rajya Sabha seats. Industrialist and media baron Vijay Sankeshwar, a former three-term Lok Sabha member, is also seen to be in the running.Two surprising names doing the rounds as potential BJP nominees are of Sudha Murthy –philanthropist and the wife of Infosys co-founder N.R. Narayana Murthy -- and K V Kamath, former chief of ICICI Bank. A senior BJP leader who did not want to be identified told HT: “Ultimately it will be a call of the party high command in consultation with the chief minister, so all the names doing rounds, while they might have aspirations, only the core committee will ultimately decide.”For the lone seat the Congress can win, former leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha Mallikarjuna Kharge is seen as the front-runner. The other names being mentioned are of former union ministers K H Muniyappa and Veerpa Moily. Muniyappa, a seven-term MP, told HT: “I am not an aspirant and would gladly support any choice made by the high command. I am ready to work in the organization to bring the party back to power in the state. My only desire is that those who have stabbed the party in the back and helped BJP come to power should not get rewarded.” His remarks indicate lingering divisions within the party, which experienced a rebellion last that year that enabled the BJP under Yediyurappa to come back to power in Karnataka.The Congress would have nearly 24 votes to spare and is likely to support JDS supremo and former PM HD Deve Gowda if he decides to contest. Political analyst Prof Harish Ramaswamy said Yediyurappa will have to do a tightrope walk to ensure that he keeps all sections in the party happy while choosing the RS candidates. “Congress and JDS are likely to reach an understanding as it will also enhance further ties between the two parties to jointly take on the BJP in the state,” Ramaswamy said.A late night meeting last week of over a dozen MLAs from North Karnataka was perceived to be a sign of a brewing rebellion against the Yeddiyurappa government, which is also preparing for the legislative council elections. According to reports, these MLAs met at senior legislator Umesh Katti’s residence. Katti himself has been eyeing a place in the state cabinet, and has also not shied away from seeking a Rajya Sabha berth for his brother.In Delhi, BJP leaders are not pleased. “Everyone has aspiration to either become a minister or get a ticket to contest. These decisions cannot be taken on the basis of arm twisting. There is a system of the parliamentary board taking decision and that will be followed in every state,” said a BJP functionary in Delhi.Discord has also been brewing over candidate selection for assembly bypolls in the party units in Madhya Pradesh and over the selection of a new party president in Himachal Pradesh to replace Rajeev Bindal, who stepped down in May after his name was indirectly dragged into a corruption case involving the state health department. In Madhya Pradesh, where the Shivraj Singh Chauhan government made a comeback in March after being out of power for 15 months; disquiet prevails over the possibility of 22 rebel MLAs being selected to contest the bypolls.“There are a couple of contenders for the president’s post {in HP}; and as is natural, their support groups have been holding meetings. There is however no threat to the state government,” said a BJP leader requesting anonymity.Political analyst Shirish Kashikar said the disagreements within the BJP were not serious enough to destabilise the party’s state governments.“Each state unit has its own dynamics, and it is obvious that there will be friction if old party workers are made to compete for positions or tickets with their erstwhile opponents,” he said. “Having said that, in each of these cases the disagreements are not so intense or deep that the opposition can instigate defections or cause the government to fall, as it had happened when the BJP engineered the fall of the Kamal Nath government in MP.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hectic-parleys-in-cong-bjp-for-k-taka-rs-berths/story-UX0h9pus3ANIK1gGGSlk4M.html

05-06-2020||India||After Kashmir, Mission Kabul is on terror groups Jaish, Lashkar radar||Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed, the terrorist groups that have been mostly active in Jammu and Kashmir for years, are rapidly mobilising operatives to radicalise, train and fight in Afghanistan on directions of Rawalpindi GHQ over the last few months, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times on ThursdayThe two terror groups are estimated to have 1,000 terror operatives in the war-torn country, most of them inducted after the February pact between the Taliban and the United States. And counting.In the last few months alone, about 200 Lashkar operatives had infiltrated into Afghanistan’s Kunar province from Bajaur Agency in Pakistan. In the last week of May, another group of 30 Lashkar-e-Tayyiba terrorists led by an ex-ISI officer Bilal aka Zarqawi slipped into Kunar’s Dangam district.A fortnight earlier, 45 Jaish operatives shepherded by Taliban commander Mullah Nek Mohammad Rabhar had entered Nangarhar’s Sherzad province through Kurram Agency in Pakistan.Face of Lashkar’s terror in AfghanistanSheikh Khitab :A Pakistani national and head of Lashkar-e-Tayyiba is active in eastern AfghanistanMaulvi Samiullah : A Pakistani national and incharge of a newly-formed LeT group in Afghanistan was associated with the module that attacked Kabul gurdwara on March 25Abu Hamza : He is incharge of the Lashkar in east Afghanistan and is based in Kunar province. He hails from Afghanistan’s Baghlan provinceJunaid, Saifullah and Abuzar: They operate under Maulvi Samiullah and are reported to be active in eastern provinces.Sayed Akbar Jan Zardhan: He is an LeT commander who is active in Gayan, Zerok and Barmal districts of PaktikaQariZiaur Rehman: Deputy governor of the ISKP in Kunar and acts as coordinator between Lashkar and Al QaedaSheikh Abdul Aziz Nuristani: Nuristani is an affiliate of Jamia Farooqia Madrassa at tajabad in Peshawar, ex-senior judge of Taliban in Nuristan province. He now works for Lashkar.Counter-terror officials in Delhi and Kabul said the focus on Afghanistan by these two terrorist groups underlines how their deployments and actions mirror the priorities of Pakistan’s ISI.For now, the ISI’s emphasis appears to be to prepare the ground to continue terror activities in case the Taliban-US peace process leads to a political settlement, one official said. From Kashmir to Afghanistan, the Pakistan state has used terror groups as its strategic arm to achieve outcomes its diplomacy can’t. This is another example, an official said.But the deployment in Afghanistan is also designed to serve as the new terror factory that can dish out terrorists for any cause that serves Pakistan interest.Bilal aka Zarqawi, the ex-ISI official who led the team of 30 LeT terrorists that entered Afghanistan was earlier incharge of a major terror training centre in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir capital Muzaffarabad.One of the early attacks this year in which Lashkar operatives are believed to have played a role is the massacre at Guru Har Rai Gurdwara in Kabul’s old city that left over 25, most of them worshippers at the shrine, dead. The attack had been linked to a centre being run jointly by the Islamic State Khorasan Province (ISKP) and the Taliban’s sword arm Haqqani Network.Jaish’s top operatives in AfghanistanQazi Swahibullah: Key leader in Shiltan district of Kunar provinceDil Mohammad: He is incharge of central Kunar provinceFazal Akbar Salarzai: Jaish incharge for Walarsar between Dangam and Shiltan districts of Kunar provinceZohoor Zarqawi: He is incharge for eastern afghanistan and hails from pakistan’s Waziristan regionFresh information emerging from Afghanistan indicates that Maulvi Samiullah, a Pakistani national who is incharge of the newly formed Lashkar group in Afghanistan, was also involved.Counter-terror officials said they had come across evidence to indicate that Lashkar operatives were, on occasions, also carrying out their missions in Afghanistan under the aegis of the cover of Jamat al-Dawa and Jaish-e-Salafi.The effort to map the presence and activities of the two terrorist groups in Afghanistan is still work in progress, one of them said. “But we have been able to identify some of those playing key roles,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-kashmir-mission-kabul-is-on-terror-groups-jaish-lashkar-radar/story-u9AXcxXueiW0ujAFAxAqjI.html
