He was earlier summoned for questioning, but the leader cited Covid-19 guidelines and expressed his inability to visit the agency. The health ministry had issued an advisory for citizens above 65 years to stay at home to protect themselves against the coronavirus pandemic.Patel, who was supposed to appear at the ED office on June 8, had also pointed out that cases of the disease had surfaced in the agency, which told him that its officers were willing to visit his home because taking the probe forward in the case was important.The Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament from Gujarat, officials said, was asked questions about his links with Nitin and Chetan Sandesara and claims made by certain witnesses.An employee of the Sandesara Group – Sunil Yadav – had claimed before the ED he ran up expenses of Rs 10 lakh for a party which was attended by Faisal Patel, son of Ahmed Patel, arranged entry in a night club for him (Faisal Patel) and once delivered Rs 5 lakh to his (Faisal Patel’s) driver in Khan Market on the instructions of Chetan Sandesara, officials said. Yadav told the ED investigation team that the money was meant for Faisal Patel, officials added.Yadav also claimed before the ED that Ahmed Patel’s son Faisal and son-in-law Irfan Siddiqui were even given code names by Chetan Sandesara.Faisal Patel and Irfan Siddiqui were questioned by ED in August and July 2019 respectively.The anti-money laundering probe agency is investigating fraud worth over Rs 14,500 crore by Sterling Biotech and its promoters - Nitin, Chetan and Deepti Sandesara.They have been absconding since 2017 and are said to be hiding in Nigeria. An Interpol red corner notice request is also pending against them.The Sandesaras are being probed by multiple agencies including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the income tax department .An investigation against the Vadodara-based Sterling Biotech began in 2017 when CBI registered a case for alleged fraud of Rs 5,000 crore on a consortium led by Andhra Bank. The ED has claimed that the fraud is bigger than the Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud to the tune of how much money involving Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi.In June 2019, ED attached moveable and immovable properties worth Rs 9,778 crores belonging to the Sandesaras including four oil rigs and oil fields in Nigeria and several ships apart from a Gulfstream aircraft and flat in London.Senior Congress leader Kapil Sibal said: “If you need to probe something, then why don’t you probe the names that appeared in the Sahara diary? There are some important people who are now power, why can’t CBI launch a probe against them? The (ED raid) is a motivated move that is aimed to divert attention from the bigger issues that have come up before the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-quizzes-patel-in-pmla-case-congress-slams-govt/story-ZPPDaxoDLBYgj8y8GMLcBJ.html
27-06-2020||India||Claims for Shramik train deaths to be referred to tribunal: Railways||New Delhi: Families of those who died on Shramik Special trains meant for transporting stranded migrant workers returning to their home states during the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) lockdown can seek compensation through the railway claims tribunal, which will decide on the matter on case-by-case basis, Railway Board chairman VK Yadav has said.“There is a very set procedure for claims and there is a railway claims tribunal. All these cases are basically referred to the railway claim tribunal and on case to case basis these claims and compensations are decided and there is a very well laid-out procedure for that.” Yadav said at a virtual press conference on Friday.Hindustan Times reported on May 30 that around 80 people had died on Shramik Special trains from May 9 till May 27, according to a Railway Protection Force report. Railways had clarified that the deaths had occurred because of pre-existing ailments.Yadav said that the ministry of railways is yet to collate the final list of deaths on board Shramik trains.“As far as the list is concerned, basically this is a state subject and so many states are involved and all these cases handled by state governments and they only finalise the cases so all those lists are yet to be collated...so far we haven’t been able to get the information from all the states but all the state governments are looking into those cases and they will be able to share the information only when they complete all the investigation and come out with their final report,” he said. In an interview to HT on June 1, railways minister Piyush Goyal said the ministry had been transparent about the deaths on board Shramik Special trains and insisted on compiling a list of them.“Some of the stories are sought to be portrayed as if people died of hunger or starvation. I can say with confidence that no one died of hunger,” he said, adding that in long-distance travel, some deaths occur even in the course of normal operations.To be clear, railways provides ex-gratia payment to victims of railway accidents under the Railway Act. The national transporter had in 2017 increased the compensation amount for the family of a deceased person to Rs 8 lakh. Compensation can also be sought under section 123 of the act citing “untoward incident.” However, in other cases, a claim for compensation can be pressed through the railway claims tribunal.“Ex-gratia is given for railway accidents caused by railways itself due to derailment or collision or any other fault. For cases of untoward incidents involving deaths or injuries caused mostly by passengers or people themselves either by trespassing or run over or accidentally falling from a train, usually no ex-gratia given. People can claim compensation through the railway claims tribunal,” a railway official explained, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/claims-for-shramik-train-deaths-to-be-referred-to-tribunal-railways/story-dj0tE7KbQljxU15dAzrSJM.html
27-06-2020||India||FIR in Rajasthan against Ramdev, aides over ‘Coronil’||A First Information Report (FIR) has been filed in Rajasthan against yoga guru Baba Ramdev, his aide and chief executive officer of Patanjali Ayurved Limited, Acharya Balkrishna, and three others for allegedly making misleading claims that the company has found a cure for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) called Coronil.The FIR was filed at the Jyoti Nagar police station in Jaipur on Friday evening by an advocate, Balbir Jakhar.A case against Ramdev, Balkrishna, Dr. Balbir Singh Tomar, Dr. Anurag Tomar and Anurag Varshney is being investigated under Section 420 (cheating) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954, on the basis of the FIR lodged by Jakhar, said Avnish Parashar, additional deputy commissioner of police (DCP), south, Jaipur.Dr. Balbir Singh Tomar is chairman of NIMS University in Jaipur where clinical trials on Coronil were carried out , Dr. Anurag Tomar is director, NIMS University and Varshney is a scientist at Patanjali Ayurved Ltd.“The accused have put the life of common people at risk. Neither the Rajasthan government nor the Centre was informed about the clinical trials about Coronil,” Jhakhar said.Acharya Balkrishna refused to comment on the FIR being lodged. However, Patanjali spokesperson Gagan Kumar, said, “Patanjali never termed Coronil as anti-Corona medicine. If a case has been registered against us regarding it, then our legal cell will reply accordingly.”His comment is at odds with the title under which the clinical trial was registered with the clinical trials regulator: an ayurvedic cure for the coronavirus disease. Kumar added: “Nobody should question Patanjali’s patriotic intent and social welfare works.”Ramdev’s herbal medicine company, Patanjali Ayurved, on Monday, launched the Coronil tablets and Swasarivati medicine that they claimed to cure the contagion within seven days.Patanjali Ayurved also claimed that the two Ayurveda-based medicines have shown 100% favourable results during clinical trials on Covid-19 patients. Hindutan Times reported the doctor in charge of the clinical trials saying that the trials were ongoing, that these were preliminary findings, that the test was not carried out on patients with co-morbidities, and that only asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic Covid-19 patients were selected fr the study. The ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha, and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) said it was unaware of Patanjali Ayurved’s claims.The ministry has sought a report from the company about the composition, testing and other data on the drugs.Patanjali Ayurved has also been asked to “stop advertising/publicising” the drugs until the ministry examines its claims.The company launched its products at a press conference and Ramdev later went on several television channels to talk about them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fir-in-rajasthan-against-ramdev-aides-over-coronil/story-NZtKcd5ui669er4eZkxOkO.html

27-06-2020||India||A ‘pleasant surprise’ claim experts on rare sighting of Finn’s Weaver birds in Uttarakhand||Endemic to the Indian subcontinent and tagged vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), a colony of Finn’s Weaver birds were sighted recently by forest officials in the Terai Central forest division of Uttarakhand after many decades, forest officials said. More than 20 nests of the bird were spotted by forest officials.The Finn’s Weaver or Yellow Weaver was first spotted in Uttarakhand in the 1950s by eminent ornithologist Dr Salim Ali. The bird, usually found in areas near agricultural fields or the Terai region, has seen a decline in population since the past few decades and experts called the sighting a ‘pleasant surprise’.Dhananjai Mohan, Director of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) and co-author of the ‘Updated Checklist and Bibliography of the Birds of Uttarakhand’ said that the Finn’s Weaver is a bird found only in the Indian subcontinent and it has not been sighted in the past few decades.“This bird has been spotted after many decades in the state. There has been a continuous decline in the population of this bird in the past few decades. In the last couple of years, there has been no confirmed sighting and it had become very depressing but now a colony has been seen, which has come as a big surprise,” Mohan said.The updated checklist of birds in Uttarakhand which Dhananjai Mohan co-authored with Sanjay Sondhi, lists 710 bird species in Uttarakhand, an increase from the first detailed checklist in 2003 that had listed 623 avian species in the Himalayan state.Mohan added that Finn’s Weaver is found only in the Indian subcontinent; Uttarakhand, Kaziranga in Assam and Shuklaphanta region in Nepal.“This bird has a very patchy, small population in a few select places in the Indian subcontinent. There are many species of weavers found in India, but this is the most threatened species, unlike Baya Weaver which is found commonly. Traditionally Finn’s Weaver birds form nests on large Semal trees, but we still don’t know too much about this bird, which is why perhaps new discoveries are being made and the bird has been found nesting over reeds in a water body this time,” added Mohan.The Uttarakhand forest department along with the Wildlife Institute of India is monitoring the nesting process of the bird, taking steps to ensure that there is no disturbance and the breeding of the birds takes places successfully, “as this is an important step in the lifecycle of the bird”.Finn’s Weaver or Finn’s Baya (Ploceus megarhynchus) builds nests on tops of trees or in reeds. According to ornithologists, they breed from May to September and line the inside of their nests, unlike other weaver birds.Asad Rahmani, former director of the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) said that the spotting of Finn’s Weaver is extremely rare.“Sightings of Finn’s Weaver are extremely rare and the current sighting is an interesting record as it has come from nesting sites. Along with Uttarakhand, there was a sighting in Bijnor region of Uttar Pradesh also and I hope the government will protect the areas where the birds were sighted. What is needed now is the protection of the habitat, as at most places nesting sites have been converted into housing colonies and almost over 90% of the habitat is gone…” said Rahmani.Rahmani added that around 1000 birds of Finn’s Weaver species is likely to be found across the world now.Abhilasha Singh, divisional forest officer (DFO) Terai Central forest division said that the sighting of these rare birds has come as a motivation for the forest staff.“The birds were sighted in the Rudrapur region of Terai Central forest division by our forest staff. As the bird is not found commonly and it had not been sighted in the past few years, this sighting comes as motivation for our forest staff. We had asked all our forest staff to report sightings of any birds similar to the Finn’s Weaver and that is how we learnt about it,” Singh said.Uttarakhand has rich avian diversity. Of the 710 species found in the state, 6 species are listed as “critically endangered” in the ‘IUCN Red List of Threatened Species’, 3 as “endangered”, 19 as “vulnerable” and 28 as “near threatened”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-pleasant-surprise-claim-experts-on-rare-sighting-of-finn-s-weaver-birds-in-uttarakhand/story-oJwCRLFewMEH57bQvhXmZI.html
27-06-2020||India||China’s Xi Jinping is a successor to dictator Joseph Stalin: US NSA O’Brien||US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien on Friday launched the Trump administration’s sharpest attack on Chinese government, comparing President Xi Jinping to Russia’s brutal dictator Joseph Stalin whose policies killed millions, and warning that the Chinese Communist Party was seeking leverage over individual Americans through propaganda and collection of their “most intimate data” via big Chinese companies that made huge investments and had even pressured Hollywood into self-censorship.Robert O’Brien, who described the foreign policy calculations of consecutive US governments towards Beijing as the US’ ”biggest miscalculation” since the 1930s, said China’s efforts to control the mind of people residing beyond its borders was underway. The communist party, he said, was using trade to coerce compliance with its diktats.While NSA Robert C. O’Brien has come out openly detailing the penetration of the Chinese Communist Party in the US, his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval - as president of the Delhi-based think tank Vivekananda International Foundation - had written a paper on the penetration of PLA intelligence in “enemy countries”. The NSA, in his paper accessed by Hindustan Times, had explained the structure of people’s Liberation Army intelligence and use of propaganda as a tool in democratic nations, an evidence of which the world is now recognising in the US, Australia, Canada, and Brazil.O’Brien said the Trump administration had started taking corrective steps and outlined six steps taken by the administration to curb the Chinese influence in the US. But he underlined that this was just the beginning.In his address to a group of people at Phoenix in Arizona, O’Brien underscored that there really was no difference between mega Chinese firms and the communist party in power in Beijing.“The Chinese Communist Party seeks total control over the people’s lives. This means economic control, it means political control, it means physical control, and, perhaps most importantly, it means thought control,” he said, according to the transcript released by the White House.O’Brien referred to the analysis by an Australian official that in Classical Chinese statecraft, there were two tools for gaining and maintaining control: the first is ‘wu’, weapons and violence, and the second is ‘wen’, language and culture. Chinese leaders have always believed that power derives from controlling both the physical battlefield and the cultural domain.The NSA cited several instances when China, in addition to propaganda, used trade to coerce compliance with its dictates. Like when Australia called for an independent investigation of the coronavirus disease, the Chinese Communist Party threatened to stop buying Australian agricultural products.O’Brien added that the Chinese reach extends to heads of international organisations who are not themselves Chinese officials.China, he said, heads 4 out of 15 UN specialised agencies, more than the US, the UK, France and Russia, the other members of the permanent members of the UN Security Council, combined. He alleged that China uses these leaders to force the international bodies to parrot Beijing’s talking points and to install Chinese telecommunications equipment in their facilities.For example, since Zhao Houlin of the International Telecommunications Union took his post, he began to aggressively promote Huawei sales. Secretary-General Fang Liu of the International Civil Aviation Organisation has blocked Taiwan’s participation in General Assembly meetings and covered up a Chinese hack of the organisation. The CPC has used China’s membership on the UN Human Rights Council to prevent criticism of its abuses in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, he said.Outlining how the CCP’s strategy could touch American lives, he said the CCP was collecting “the most intimate data — your words, your actions, your purchases, your whereabouts, your health records, your social media posts, your texts, and mapping your network of friends, family, and acquaintances”.“The CCP accomplishes this goal, in part, by subsidizing hardware, software, telecommunications, and even genetics companies. As a result, corporations such as Huawei and ZTE undercut competitors on price and install their equipment around the globe at a loss. This has the side effect of putting out of business American manufacturers of telecom hardware and has made it very difficult for Nokia and Ericsson. Why do they do it? Because it is not telecom hardware or software profits the CCP are after, it is your data. They use “backdoors” built into the products to obtain that data,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-xi-jinping-is-a-successor-to-dictator-joseph-stalin-us-nsa-o-brien/story-IVMDe3D2OJPdLgHIje2jhM.html
27-06-2020||India||In life patience pays off: Azhar||After his first film got shelved, actor Azhar Khan had to wait for more than a decade for his debut film. And, the actor is glad that his wait was worthwhile as his film has earned a lot of appreciation by all.“It’s has been a long wait me, almost 11 years, but still my dream did come true,” said the Jhansi lad over the phone.Telling us more about what took him so long to arrive, he said, “I come from a political and business family. My grandfather was the mayor of Jhansi so it was obvious that someday I’d join our family business. My father wanted me to complete my MBA and then join him. I wanted to go abroad and during the prep time I joined college in Pune.” It because of his unconventional looks and long hair his friends suggested that he should actually try his luck in modelling. “I tried and got a few modelling assignments in Mumbai. Then I got a film offer, which was based on the Neeraj Grover murder case. That was 11 years ago but unfortunately the film couldn’t be completed.”A UPite by heart, Azhar feels in small town life and people are much easy and happy. “I have spent a major chunk of my life in cities like Pune and Mumbai and love the vibe of these cities but the atmosphere there is very competitive and your presence is short lived. So, making a mark is very tough for all. My city Jhansi and even Lucknow, for that matter, are completely opposite.” The wait for Azhar was long but fruitful. “Patience pays off! Like, in my case, where many of my contemporaries of that time couldn’t get many opportunities and took up different professions but I did hold on to get my debut film. After my film was shelved, I took up real estate business and it kept me busy and afloat. Else, many others go into depression in such state of affairs. It was in 2018 when I got a call for Ram Kamal Mukherjee’s directorial ‘Season’s Greetings.’ First, I thought it can’t be true but after meeting the filmmakers, I was actually all glad and happy,” he said.The film had actor Celina Jaitley Haag opposite him. “The film released on OTT and was well received. My character Usman was able to leave a mark. It made me a known face overnight resulting in numerous followers on my social media accounts. I am relived but now I want to just work. I am all upbeat about the new projects coming my way. Soon, things will be on a roll and it’s now or never for me. This is the time I want to make most of it and reach the stars.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/in-life-patience-pays-off-azhar/story-Gs2AFpfvELV4Uyl4LEL3VP.html

It was decided that no activities shall be permitted in the capital city on Sundays except essential services and supplies.

The bridge, crucial for supplying ration to the army and the ITBP men near the Indo-China border, had also cut off about 7,000 people living in various villages after its collapse.“We have built a new 120-feet long Bailey bridge in about five days of time after the collapse of the old one. With the new bridge, the connectivity to about 15 villages has also been restored from today morning at 11 am,” said PK Rai, a BRO official working in the area.Rai added, “The bridge has also made it convenient for security personnel to access their posts near the Indo-China border in Johar Valley area.”At the time of the bridge collapse, there was construction work going on for another bridge. On June 23, police booked the injured trailer driver for negligent driving and causing property damage on the complaint of a BRO official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bridge-collapses-near-india-china-border-new-one-built-within-5-days/story-d3gGiWT4TmiayfsSe7fXLM.html

We will have to be more alert and cautious. People of rural areas should not visit the urban areas in the district for next 15 days unless there is an emergency.” said Ganjam district collector Vijay Amrit Kulange.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.In the last 24 hours, Ganjam district reported 58 new Covid-19 cases including 13 policemen taking the tally to 1,195, out of which 811 have recovered and 375 still in various hospitals. So far nine people in the district have succumbed to the virus.Following the footsteps of Ganjam, the administration of Gajapati too decided to enforce complete shutdown in the district from June 28 to June 30 to contain the spread of Covid-19. Since the beginning of June, the administration in 11 districts including Khurda where cases are going up regularly, have enforced two-day weekend shutdowns.In Bhubaneswar, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation has meanwhile announced compulsory 14-day institutional quarantine for those returning to the city slums from other Covid hotspots like Ganjam, Cuttack, Balasore, Gajapati and Jajpur. They will have to undergo institutional quarantine before moving into the slums, said Municipal Commissioner Prem Chandra Chaudhary.With 282 cases in the last 17 days, many of them home quarantine cases, officials said the institutional quarantine will be enforced strictly as social distancing conditions are impossible in slums areas. “Social distancing is not possible in slums because of high population density. In such a situation, asymptomatic people can spread the virus to many others,” he said.Similarly, in Puri town, where the nine-day Rath Yatra is underway, the district administration is going to impose a 48-hour curfew in the district from the night of June 30 to July 2 morning, said district collector Balwant Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-cases-rise-odisha-enforces-shutdown-and-quarantine-in-many-towns/story-Ar5F5y68KdWV7wavVBV12O.html

27-06-2020||India||Tribunal to decide on compensation for deaths on Shramik trains: Railways||Families of several migrant workers who died on board Shramik Special trains can seek compensation through the railways claim tribunal, said railway board chairman VK Yadav on Friday.“There is a set procedure for claims and there is a railway claim tribunal. All these cases are basically referred to the railway claim tribunal and on case to case basis these claims and compensations are decided and there is a very well laid out procedure for that,” Yadav said at a virtual press conference.Hindustan Times had reported on May 30 that around 80 people have died in Shramik Special trains between May 9 and May 27, according to Railway Protection Force’s report. The Railways had clarified that deaths had occurred due to pre-existing ailments.The chairman also said that the ministry is yet to collate the final list of deaths on board Shramik trains.“As far as the list is concerned, basically this is a state subject and so many states are involved and all these cases handled by state governments and they only finalise the cases so all those lists are yet to be collated...so far we haven’t been able to get the information from all the states but all the state governments are looking into those cases and they will be able to share the information only when they complete all the investigation and come out with their final report,” he said. In an interview to HT on June 1, railway minister Piyush Goyal had said Railways has been transparent about deaths and insisted on compiling a list of them.“Some of the stories are sought to be portrayed as if people died of hunger or starvation. I can say with confidence that no one died of hunger,” he had said, adding that in long-distance travel, some deaths occur even in normal operations.To be clear, railways provides ex-gratia payment to victims of railway accidents under the Railway Act. The national transporter had in 2017 increased the compensation amount for the family of a deceased person to Rs 8 lakh. Compensation can also be sought under section 123 of the Act citing “untoward incident.” However, in other cases, a claim for compensation can also be sought through the railway claim tribunal.“Ex gratia is given for railway accidents caused by railways itself due to derailment or collision or any other fault. For cases of untoward incidents involving deaths or injuries caused mostly by passengers or people themselves either by trespassing or run over or accidentally falling from a train, usually no ex-gratia is given. People can claim compensation through the railway claims tribunal,” a railway official explained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribunal-to-decide-on-compensation-for-deaths-on-shramik-trains-railways/story-qknnJdxDHZGlM9IgetwOZO.html

He was murdered in Pipariya, more than 146 kilometres from Bhopal, in Hoshangabad district, according to police.According to police, Ravi was accompanied by two others in his car while going home after attending a meeting of the organisation in Hoshangabad, when around 10 assailants in a car intercepted the vehicle and attacked his car with iron rods and sticks before attacking Ravi with sharp edged weapons and then shooting him dead from a close range.As seen in the video clip, the assailants dragged the victim out of the car even after shooting at him and continued to hit him with rods and other weapons. He died at the spot.Bhura Patel who accompanied Ravi in the car told the police that the assailants’ target was only Ravi as they let his companions go.Superintendent of police of Hoshangabad district Santosh Singh Gaur said, “A personal rivalry between the two sides over domination on the mandi in Hoshangabad could be a reason behind the murder as has been gathered in the preliminary investigation by the police. An FIR has been lodged against 10 named persons who are all local residents and were known to the deceased.”He added that a reward of Rs 10,000 each for capturing the assailants had been announced. “We have announced a reward of Rs 10000 each on each of the assailants and three teams have been formed to nab them.

The Sandesaras are being probed by multiple agencies including the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and the income tax department as well.The ED team, which arrived at Patel’s 23, Mother Crescent bungalow at around 12 noon, spent the next eight hours questioning him in this case.When the ED team left his house, Ahmed Patel told a group of reporters waiting outside that the government was trying to divert attention from the Chinese action at the Ladakh border and the Covid-19 fallout by targeting opposition leaders. Today the Modi Government sent some visitors to my house pic.twitter.com/Lr2PFaIjUT“At a time when we have such a tense situation on the Indo-China border, China has grabbed our land and people are suffering due to mismanagement of Covid-19 crisis by this government, it is trying to divert the attention by targeting opposition leaders. I feel sorry for these (ED) officials who are being used by this government. I believe in the Constitution and have answered whatever they wanted to know.”Patel, 70, was political secretary to Sonia Gandhi when the Congress-led United Progressive Alliance was in power between 2004 and 2014.He had been summoned for questioning earlier but the veteran Congress leader had cited the government’s Covid-19 guidelines to express his inability to visit the agency.

27-06-2020||India||Members of 3 communities get J&K domicile certificates||Members of the Valmiki Samaj, the Hindu refugees from erstwhile west Pakistan and the Gurkhas, got domicile certificates from the Jammu & Kashmir (J&K) administration on Saturday after years of being denied equal rights. Earlier, they were not considered as permanent residents in the erstwhile J&K, which was bifurcated into two Union Territories (UTs) – J&K and Ladakh – after the scrapping of Article 370 of the Constitution on August 5, 2019.“It’s a red-letter day for us. The first domicile certificate was given to Deepo Devi, who is 70 -years-old. She had retired from Jammu Municipal Corporation (JMC), as a safai karamchari (sanitation worker) long ago,” said Gharu Bhatti, a leader from the Valmiki community.“We’re happy to be finally considered as legitimate citizens of J&K. Our youngsters see a new ray of hope. Now, they, too, can become officers and get good state government jobs,” he added.Bhatti, however, took a dig at Kashmir-centric parties such as the National Conference (NC) and the People’s Democratic Party (PDP) for opposing the new domicile law.“These parties have been claiming from the outset that attempts are being made to change J&K’s demography. However, they were trying to turn it into a Muslim-dominated state for all these years. Be it Farooq Abdullah, Omar Abdullah of the NC, or Mehbooba Mufti of the PDP, they never allowed us to enjoy equal rights,” Bhatti said.He lauded the J&K authorities’ move to hand over the domicile certificates that have “ended slavery by successive Kashmir-centric regimes”.The Valmiki community was brought to erstwhile J&K in 1957 from Punjab’s Gurdaspur and Amritsar on the assurance of the then Prime Minister of J&K, Bakshi Ghulam Mohammed, that they would be given permanent resident status and other privileges.However, for over 62 years they worked as sweepers (safai karamcharis), irrespective of their educational qualifications, because they were never considered citizens of the J&K.Labha Ram Gandhi, the chairman of the West Pakistani Refugees Action Committee (WPRAC), praised the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) at the Centre for its humanitarian approach that helped his displaced community members to get respect and dignity for the rest of their lives.“Nothing was done to solve our humanitarian crisis. We were betrayed by successive Central governments and erstwhile J&K authorities. We were denied our basic fundamental rights, as the majority of the refugees are Dalits,” Gandhi alleged.Members of WPRAC have been ineligible for government jobs and admission to any professional course at a state-run institute.Most members of WPRAC had come from Sialkot in west Punjab during the Partition and are settled in Jammu, Samba and Kathua districts in the Jammu division.Sanjeev Verma, divisional commissioner, Jammu, organised a special camp on Saturday to handover 50 domicile certificates to members of these three displaced communities.Under the Domicile Rules, all those people and their children, who have lived in J&K for 15 years, or have studied for seven years and appeared in Board examinations (Grade X or XII) from a UT-based educational institution are eligible for the grant of domicile.Children of central government officials; All India service officers; officials of public sector undertakings (PSU); and autonomous body of central government; public sector Banks, officials of statutory bodies, officials of central Universities and recognised research institutes of the central government, who have served in the UT for 10 years are also eligible for the domicile status.Besides, all those migrants and their children, who are registered with the Relief and Rehabilitation Commissioner, will be granted a domicile certificate. Children of those residents of J&K, who reside outside the UT, because of their employment, business, or other professional or vocational reasons have become eligible for the grant of domicile status.West Pakistan refugees (WPRs), sanitation workers and children of Women married outside J&K, who were earlier deprived, are also eligible for a domicile certificate. WPRs were part of the parliamentary electoral roll, but not of the erstwhile state electoral roll. They will now be covered under the 15-year domicile rule or their children under the seven-year or class X/XII rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/members-of-3-communities-get-j-k-domicile-certificates/story-nASMjhTUyd23jNz4C9nbQN.html
27-06-2020||India||UP cops hunt for 15 impersonators in Bihar who rigged constable recruitment exam||The special cell of Uttar Pradesh police has launched a manhunt for 15 impersonators from Bihar who allegedly helped candidates to be fraudulently recruited as constables, many of them in Varanasi.The UP government had conducted written exams for recruitment of 41,000 constables in June 2018 at 860 centres. More than three dozen impersonators (whom the police call solvers) were arrested during the exams.The lid was blown off the racket in December 2019 after a man was caught with a prosthetic thumb during a biometric verification process at the police lines in Varanasi.“His arrest exposed the nexus between solvers and employees of a software company who were committing fraud in the online verification process. During interrogation, the accused identified as Vivek Yadav of Azamgarh revealed the name of some suspects and police lodged an FIR on that basis,” said a police officer.On Saturday, a crime branch team of Varanasi police carried out simultaneous raids in Nalanda and Nawada and nabbed a coaching institute’s teacher identified as Rajesh Kumar.Police said that Rajesh, a native of Giriyak police station area of Nalanda, was arrested. However, the kingpin of the racket, who used to arrange solvers for the candidates, managed to escape from Nawada and a search is on for him.During interrogation Rajesh revealed the names of over eight people who were said to be involved in the fraud.With more than 12 impersonators of Patna and Begusarai on its radar, the Uttar Pradesh police teams have visited Bihar several times till date.A Nalanda police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “Rajesh had been involved in such activities for about four years and had kept his activities limited to the bordering districts of Bihar and Uttar Pradesh only to avoid detection.”He would charge Rs 4 to 5 lakh from each aspirant to provide services of impersonators, the officer said. Additional SP (Varanasi) Mohammad Mushtaq confirmed his arrest. “Some aspirants came under suspicion as their handwriting and signature failed to match with those on their original application forms,” he said.Two persons identified, as Pradeep Bhardwaj and Rakesh Kumar, were caught on charges of completing the biometric verification process of Vivek from some other location instead of Varanasi police lines.In the course of the investigation police also found that 14 scholars appeared in the biometric verification process in Varanasi police line while 13 of them passed in examination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-cops-hunt-for-15-impersonators-in-bihar-who-rigged-constable-recruitment-exam/story-cNbF9nM5cdtVgonSTVZWVN.html

But later it said it had started tracing their contacts. Though the state boasts of many records like low mortality and the highest recovery rate in the country, its testing rate is still poor.As on Saturday 2,11,211 people were tested-- they include sentinel, rapid body, TrueNat, augmented and RT-PCR tests. There is criticism that the state is keeping its tests abysmally low to keep its records but the government has denied it.The government has also decided to lift the lockdown on Sunday till further orders. But the night curfew (9 pm to 5 am) will continue, said a statement from the office of Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan. For the last two months, the state has been observing complete lockdown on Sundays. With 195 new cases, the total number of Covid-19 cases has risen to 4,071.

The state has reported 23 deaths so far.Kerala’s tally is likely to go up as more than 50 flights are expected daily, all from the Middle-East in the next one week. The state and the Centre had crossed swords after the former insisted on Covid-19-free certificates for returning expatriates. Later, it was forced to tone down the demand after the Centre made it clear that it will affect evacuation. At least three lakh more people are expected to return from the Gulf countries. Over one lakh people have returned since special flights began on May 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-begins-tracing-contacts-of-those-testing-covid-19-positive-in-tamil-nadu/story-BpUypxzgNJxS1mIw018MoL.html

The machines installed in the mills usually used to be the Chinese ones and were delivered through an Indian company.They were more in demand due to their low prices in comparison to the Japanese variants. However, after the Galwan Valley clash, the rice millers voluntarily decided not to use the Chinese machines and opted for Japanese ones. These machines are used for sorting out fine grains from the discoloured and broken ones before packaging. “I had given order to a Chinese company through its Indian agent for purchasing and procuring rice sorting machines, but following the standoff and a call of boycotting of Chinese products, I have cancelled the order. I have now placed an order to a Japanese company for the supply of the machine,” said Rajesh Bansal, a rice miller in Rudrapur area.

Sama Madi, 45, and his 42-year-old wife Sukuri Madi of Pendalguda were found lying in a pool of blood when the police reached the village.“The couple was most likely hacked to death by their neighbour. We have arrested two people in this connection and the hunt is on for more suspects,” said Malkangiri SP Khilari Rishikesh. The officer added that the bodies had been sent for post-mortem.According to police, the murdered couple were blamed by one of their neighbours for a medical condition that he and his wife were suffering from and for the death of the neighbour’s 10-year-old daughter last year.There have been a number of killings in the state due to witch-hunting even though the government had enacted the ‘Odisha Prevention of Witch-hunting Act, 2013’ six years ago to tackle the issue. The legislation aims at prohibiting witch-hunting and other similar practices.Last week, three people including a woman, were hacked to death and two others were assaulted over suspicions of practising black magic in three districts of the state. A 30-year-old man beheaded a woman in Mayurbhanj district before walking into the police station with the severed head and in Rayagada district, a man hacked two elderly people to death.In another incident, a woman in Nayagarh district was molested in a kangaroo court while her husband was forced to put his hand in a can of boiling water as they were suspected of practising witchcraft.A 14-year-old boy in Malkangiri district was allegedly killed by a group of people earlier this month on the suspicion that he practised black magic that led to the death of 17 tribals over three months.Concerned at the rising number of witchcraft-related killings, state officials said an awareness campaign would soon be started in the district with the distribution of leaflets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tribal-couple-in-odisha-s-malkangiri-hacked-to-death-over-witchcraft-allegations/story-3qN1b0bizmjpHpAHxmLUVO.html

27-06-2020||India||Telangana govt finds private labs violating Covid-19 testing norms, issues stern warning||The Telangana government on Saturday hinted at taking stern action against private diagnostic laboratories in the state which are allegedly violating norms and not following the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in conducting tests for Covid-19.State director of medical and health G Srinivasa Rao said as many as four teams comprising senior microbiologists and senior officers from the medical and health department, which conducted inspections in 16 out of 18 private laboratories in the state on Wednesday, found large-scale violation of norms in conducting Covid-19 tests.Rao said the inspection teams looked at various aspects like infrastructure, human resources, infection control measures and other facilities including general hygiene. “The teams went through the registers and data uploaded by the labs into the ICMR and Telangana state portal and found a lot of discrepancies in the data,” he said.ALSO READ | Health ministry team to visit Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana to assess Covid-19 crisisAccording to the numbers uploaded by the private labs, tests done by them were 9,577 and Covid-19 positive cases detected were 2,076 as per the ICMR portal since they got the permission. But in the state portal, the uploaded figure was 6,733 tests and 2,836 positive cases.“But during the inspection, it was revealed from the records available with the labs that the total number of tests done by them was 12,700 and the positive cases were 3,571. At one of the labs in a major hospital, the actual number of tests conducted was 3,940 but they uploaded only 1,568 tests and showed 475 as positive,” the director said.The inspection report submitted by the expert teams revealed that many of the labs were not taking safety measures such as the staff not wearing personal protection equipment (PPE), safety cabinets not being available and lack of proper hygienic conditions. The staff conducting the tests for Covid-19 has not been trained properly in RT-PCR testing.ALSO READ | Andhra’s Covid-19 tally crosses 10,000, Telangana expects same numbers soonThe report pointed out that some of the labs did not follow measures for quality control and validation of tests. “There is a suspicion that in some labs, pooled testing was being done, instead of individual tests. As a result, some negative cases were also shown as positive,” it said.It is also suspected that there is possibility of contamination of samples leading to high positivity rate because safety measures and protocols are not followed meticulously. The teams also observed that in some labs, the testing area was very congested, and hygiene was poor and equipment maintenance was not good.“Some of the labs were conducting tests for walk-ins, advertising that samples would be collected from different places in the city, while the government guidelines very clearly stated that only symptomatic cases and patients admitted in hospitals should be tested,” Rao said.The expert committees recommended stringent action against some of the labs for violating norms and not following guidelines. ICMR has also directed the Gandhi Medical College to conduct quality control tests for private labs, he said.When contacted, Suprita Reddy, managing director of Vijaya Diagnostics, a popular diagnostic centre in Hyderabad, said the inspection teams had not found any violations in its labs. “The teams were fully satisfied with the conditions and procedures we are following for Covid-19 testing,” she said.A top executive in another popular diagnostics in Hyderabad, who pleaded anonymity, admitted there could be discrepancies in the figures being uploaded in ICMR and state government portals. “This is basically because most of the time, their servers would be down and uploading of figures is difficult. There is a lot of clerical activity involved in it,” he said.He also said testing of samples of Covid-19 suspects was a cumbersome exercise and it depends on the place of collection of swabs – nose or throat. “Sometimes, there is a possibility of the samples testing negative, even if the patients are positive. It happens even in government labs,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-govt-finds-private-labs-violating-covid-19-testing-norms-issues-stern-warning/story-3smNZqCaNlQUCqwrDEdBHK.html
27-06-2020||India||In a pincer move, Gadkari, Nadda jab Congress over national security and ties with China||BJP president JP Nadda and former party president Nitin Gadkari launched a two-fronted counter attack on Thursday in response to Congress party’s continuous offensive against the Centre, primarily on the issue of Chinese incursions.While Nadda posed several questions including over alleged donations from Chinese Embassy to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation-- a trust named after the former prime minister of India and chaired by Congress President Sonia Gandhi—Gadkari questioned the party’s record on issues concerning national security.“Recall the history of the past 25 years, how many incidents of bomb blasts took place, temples were attacked, innocent were killed. Congress governments (in the past) had a habit of surrendering to terrorists,” Gadkari said while addressing party workers in Rajasthan from Nagpur over a virtual Jan Samvad Rally. He added that it was then easy for Pakistan to train and send terrorists to attack India.Referring to the current stand-off with China over the boundary issue at the Line of Control in Ladakh, Gadkari said India was not interested in usurping any other country’s land. “ We don’t want to appropriate any other country’s land, we don’t want to intrude into any other country’s territory. We have brotherly ties with Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh and we stand by them in any situation,” Gadkari addedEarlier, JP Nadda had held a press conference to question Congress’ alleged financial link with China and sought to know if that had compromised the decision making by Congress-led governments in the past.BJP chief JP Nadda keeps up attack on Congress, Sonia Gandhi“Rajiv Gandhi Foundation got donations from Chinese Embassy from 2005 to 2009. It received donations from tax havens of Luxembourg every year between 2006 to 2009. What does it indicate to you? NGOs and companies with deep commercial interests donated money to the foundation,” Nadda was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Earlier, Nadda had attacked the Congress over a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the Chinese Communist Party and sought to know the nature of the MoU.On Saturday, he alleged the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation worked in close association with China Association for Internationally Friendly Contact. He said the Chinese organization was a vehicle used by Central Military Commission of China to infiltrate and influence the voices of leaders of other countriesCongress tells PM Modi to ‘condemn China’s brazen occupation’ in Ladakh“What was the role of RGF with the China Association for Internationally Friendly Contact and Central Military Commission of China? How was it trying to influence policymakers of our country?” Nadda asked.BJP’s stepped-up offensive against the Congress follows a continuing series of attacks by the Congress alleging Prime Minister Narendra Modi had ceded advantage to China by towing Beijing’s line on the border clashes with India. The Congress has also accused the PM of keeping the country misinformed by denying the presence of Chinese Army on the Indian side of the LAC in Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-pincer-move-gadkari-jabs-congress-over-national-security-nadda-on-ties-with-china/story-Cm0QLMzJSEcqWfi2R2UCsM.html
27-06-2020||India||India reached 1 to 5 lakh Covid-19 cases in just 39 days. Experts tell why||It took 110 days for coronavirus infections in the country to reach one lakh, while just 39 days more to go past the five lakh-mark.Medical experts have pointed to the ramped up Covid-19 testing, now available more extensively and at a reasonable price, as a big reason for the spike in cases recently.Six days after recording four lakh infections, India’s Covid-19 tally went past the five lakh-mark on Saturday with the highest single-day surge of 18,552 cases, while the death toll climbed to 15,685, according to Union health ministry data.The Covid-19 caseload increased to 5,08,953, while 384 fatalities were recorded in the last 24 hours, the updated figure at 8 am showed.This was the fourth consecutive day when coronavirus infection increased by more than 15,000, while there has been a surge of 3,18,418 infections from June 1 till 27. Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh are the top contributors to the rising tally.It took 64 days for Covid-19 cases in India to touch the (May 19) one lakh-mark from 100 cases, and another fortnight to cross two lakh cases on June 3. It took 10 days for the tally to touch the three lakh-mark and another eight days for the cases to climb to four lakh. The nationwide lockdown was first imposed on March 25 for 21 days in a bid to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus. The lockdown was first extended till May 3 and then again till May 17. It was further extended till May 31.The lockdown is now restricted only in containment zones across the country and will continue till June 30. A large number of social, economic, religious and sports activities are currently allowed to function under what the Ministry of Home Affairs termed as ‘Unlock 1’.After the government initiated the unlock procedure to make-up for the economic cost of the lockdown, the Covid-19 cases started to gallop.Dr. Monica Mahajan, Director, Internal Medicine, Max Healthcare, said it is important to understand the reason for the exponential rise in cases.The numbers are doubling at such a fast rate due to factors such as the high reproduction number of the virus (the number of cases, on average, an infected person will cause during their infectious period), she said. Also, with the lifting of lockdown norms people’s behaviour has changed again as they are not acting as responsibly as before in terms of social distancing, and testing has become more liberal, Mahajan told PTI.She said the price of the test has come down and test kits are more easily available, so more cases are being detected.Noted city-based lung surgeon Dr Arvind Kumar said definitely a big reason for cases going up is increased testing.The percentage of people turning out to be positive from among those tested is also going up as due to lifting of the lockdown people have completely forgotten social distancing norms and are out on the streets with scant regard for the pandemic, said Kumar, who works at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), a cumulative total of 79,96,707 samples have been tested up to June 26 with 2,20,479 samples being tested on Friday, the highest in a day since the beginning of the pandemic.The government has ramped up its testing infrastructure across the country significantly with the ICMR validating around 1,007 diagnostic labs, of which 734 are in the government sector and 273 private sector.The per day testing capacity which was around 1.4 lakh on May 25 has been increased to three lakh per day now.Starting with one single laboratory, the National Institute of Virology (NIV) in Pune and having 100 laboratories in the beginning of the lockdown, the ICMR on June 23 validated 1000th testing laboratory.The real-time RT-PCR is the gold standard test for detecting cases of Covid-19 and the average time taken is around 4-5 hours from receipt of sample to getting the result. It requires a specialised laboratory set-up because of which this test cannot be performed at every district-level lab which does not have molecular virology facilities, the ICMR said recently.Thus the TrueNat and the CBNAAT systems have also been deployed for diagnosis of Covid-19 in view of availability of customised cartridges.Besides, the ICMR recently also approved the use of rapid-antigen test for coronavirus infection that gives results in 30 minutes and has also advised carrying out rapid antibody tests only for surveillance purposes.India reported its first case of coronavirus infection on January 30 from Kerala.The number of active cases currently stands at 1,97,387 while 2,95,880 people have recovered and one patient has migrated.“Thus, around 58.13 per cent patients have recovered so far,” an official said.India is the fourth worst-hit nation by the pandemic after the US, Brazil and Russia.According to Johns Hopkins University, which has been compiling Covid-19 data from all over the world, India is at the eighth position in terms of the death toll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reached-1-to-5-lakh-covid-19-cases-in-just-39-days-experts-tell-why/story-NtfCo8QTrg9R16RAVbr3BO.html
27-06-2020||India||Kerala’s reverse quarantine worries elderly, calls grow for its dilution||Velayudhan Nair, 72, a retired Kerala government official, is really agitated these days. His monthly outings to the state treasury in Thiruvananthapuram to receive his pension have been halted as the state government has implemented reverse quarantine. Nair used the day as an opportunity to frequent his favourite eating joint, and meet old colleagues.“Last time when I went out a police officer told me next time he will book me. When I told him about my pension, he said these things have to be done online. I told him I am not a geek and he advised me to better learn it,” he said, adding his movements were restricted even though he followed all norms by using face mask, maintaining physical distance and using sanitisers to keep hands germ-free.“Deprivation of travel is almost like incarceration,” complained another elderly person, adding it is a double blow as they face discrimination in house and outside also.These complaints have surfaced after Kerala started implementing reverse quarantine, a way to isolate elderly from others to avoid catching possible coronavirus infection. Mental health experts and geriatric care activists say reverse quarantine should be voluntary not mandatory. They warned it is taking a big toll on elderly and the ruthless implementation will have to be diluted. They say some incidents of locking up of elderly were reported in the state and people from the economically weaker section are worst affected.“Reverse quarantine is not locking up elderly. We have given strict instructions and it should be done with full knowledge and consent of the people concerned. They have to be convinced it is for their safety,” said state health minister KK Shailaja, adding reverse quarantine is possible in houses where there are many rooms.One among other problems is separating the grandchildren from their grandparents. Each family member will have to do her role to minimise chances of bringing virus to the household and if elders are at home they will have to be extra cautious.“In reverse quarantine, there should be a mechanism to address emotional and social vacuum. We should be very careful while dealing with elderly population. There are possibilities of emotional breakdown and we have to address them,” said palliative care expert Dr MR Rajagopal. He said reverse quarantine is a double-edged weapon which will have to be used judiciously otherwise after Covid-19 there will be a number of emotionally distressed people. Experts working in coronavirus counselling centres say they do get maximum calls from elderly these days. “It is not isolation. It is a mechanism to protect them. This message will have to go to them. We have to ensure all their basic needs before they go in quarantine,” said Dr Soumya Raj, district mental health nodal officer in Ernakulam, adding they have an elaborate list of people belonging to high-risk group and that they are called regularly.The state government had barred those above 60 from taking up work under MGNREGA. However, after complaints from self-help groups, it raised the age bar to 65.More than 3 lakh MGNREGA workers are above 60 and 70 per cent of them are women, says the state social security mission. According to the 2011 census, 12.7 per cent of the 3.34 crore population in the state is above 60. But last year’s state economic review says 48 lakh people are above 60 years of age and out of these 15 per cent are above 80. A 2015 India population study says 1.85 lakh elderly people are staying alone in their homes in the state.Health experts say though reverse quarantine is a tried and tested procedure to protect the elderly, its mindless implementation will bring more repercussions. In Kerala, out of 23 deaths 20 are above 60 years. The ICMR study says at least 52 per cent of the dead in the country are above 60 years. Kerala was one of the states to implement reverse migration first.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reverse-quarantine-not-locking-up-elderly-kerala-minister-after-complaints/story-4Fe6krsUlqLPuriVBtlz1N.html

But, due to lockdown and many initiatives taken by the government as well as a people driven fight, India is much better placed than many other nations. India’s recovery rate is rising,” Modi said.India’s death per million due to Covid is under 12 while the death rate in Italy was 574 per million,he said.India was much better placed than many other nations, Modi said and pointed that the figures in the United States, Spain, Britain and France were much higher than India.Lakhs of villages, home to almost 85 crore people remain almostuntouchedby the coronavirus, he said.“The people-driven fight has given good results so far,” Modi said, cautioning that people can’t let their guards down yet. “In fact, we have to be even more careful now.Wearing masks, following social distancing, avoiding crowded places remain important,” he said. Pointing out that the coronavirus is not only a physical sickness but a threat to the lives of the people, he said “It also takes our attention to unhealthy lifestyles. A global pandemic implies that humanity as a whole needs healing. Let’s do everything possible for further harmony and happiness on our planet.” Modi said the wheels of trade and commerce have to move even as the fight against the pandemic continues. “At the same time, we have to focus on economic growth and prosperity for 130 crore Indians.The wheels of trade and commerce have to move. Agriculture has to flourish. In the last few weeks, the government of India has addressed both short-term and long-term issues relating to the economy. From the sea to space, from the farms to the factories, people-friendly and growth friendly decisions have been taken,” the prime minister said. Conveying his birthday greetings to the Metropolitan and wishing him long life and best health, Modi said “Dr.Joseph Mar Thoma has devoted his life for the betterment of our society and nation. He has been particularly passionate about removal of poverty and women empowerment.” Modi said the Mar Thoma Church is closely linked with the novel ideals of St Thomas, the apostle of Lord Christ.It is with this spirit of humility that the Mar Thoma Church has worked to bring a positive difference in the lives of fellow Indians, he said. They have done so much in areas such as healthcare and education, he said. India has always been open to spiritual influence from many sources, the prime minister said, adding that the contributions of St Thomas and the Christian community are deeply valued. Modi said the church, which has played a role in India’s freedom struggle, was in the fore front of working towards national integration and had fought the emergency. It has also “worked to bring a positive difference in the lives of our fellow Indians.”  “The Mar Thoma Church played a role in India’s freedom struggle.The church was at the forefront of working towards national integration.Church fought the Emergency. It is a matter of immense pride that the Mar Thoma Church is firmly rooted in Indian values.The contribution of the Church has also been recognized at the national level,” Modi said.The prime minister said, “the Holy Bible talks extensively about togetherness” and urged the church to work together for the advancement of the nation. While the country was moving towards self-reliance, the Mar Thoma Church, in line with its values, will surely “rise to the occasion and play a key role” in India’s growth trajectory in the times to come, he said.Various programmes have been scheduled as part of the one-year birthday celebrations.The Malankara Mar Thoma Syrian church is believed to have been founded by St Thomas, one of the 12 disciples of Jesus Christ.The Thiruvalla headquartered churchin Pathanamthitta district is one of the oldest denominations of Christianity.The church has approximately over 1.6 million followers across the globe and has 13 dioceses||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/constitution-is-our-guiding-light-says-pm-modi-at-mar-thoma-church-event/story-KEVEKV3Af23vCvXhtVLP2L.html

It is also watching the time taken by the PLA to restore status quo ante as anything less would be an exercise in perfidy.Both the sides are engaged in a dialogue through diplomatic and military channels with India looking at physical verification of the PLA withdrawal before coming out with any positive statement. With the Darbuk-Shyok Daulat Beg Oldi (DSDBO) road complete, Indian Army engineers are now connecting patrolling posts with roads so that the capacity and capability of troops to respond to any unilateral action from across the border rises manifold.With China deploying surface-to-air missiles in Aksai Chin in May, the Indian side has also responded in the same fashion with long-range weapons placed all along the 3,488 km LAC. Besides China, the Indian Army is also watching the Pakistani posture in occupied Gilgit-Baltistan.Although many a western strategists have stated that India will take help of its key ally US in case the red flag goes up, the mood in the Narendra Modi government is to go solo with sufficient force deployed to repel any action of the adversary. The Indian military is deployed in air, land and at sea with submarines patrolling the deep ocean and ready for any deterrent action.However, national security planners are confident that better sense will prevail over PLA Commander-in-Chief Xi Jinping and Western Theatre Commander Zhao Zongqi as no conflict is one sided.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-waits-for-china-s-pla-to-disengage-at-ladakh-says-won-t-allow-a-new-normal/story-qqCFMq1SCROHOwfgUeNSYN.html

27-06-2020||India||BJP chief JP Nadda keeps up attack on Congress and Sonia Gandhi||BJP chief JP Nadda continued his attack on the Congress party for the second day on Saturday, saying that under the garb of China and corona crisis, party president Sonia Gandhi should not shy away from the answering questions that the nation wants to know. He again reiterated that the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) got donations from Chinese Embassy between 2005 and 2009. “It is a sacrifice of national interest to accept money from foreign powers in personal trust. The country wants to know what transpired between the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation and the Chinese government?” the BJP chief said during a virtual press conference. The BJP chief also claimed that the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation received donation from Mehul Choksi.“Why did you take donation in Rajiv Gandhi Foundation from Mehul Choksi and give loan to him? The country wants to know as to why the foundation took money from Mehul Choksi and what is the relation between Mehul Choksi and Rajiv Gandhi Foundation?,” Nadda asked party president Sonia Gandhi as part of 10 questions that he put to her and the party. On Friday too, the BJP chief had targeted the party and Sonia Gandhi in a series of tweets, saying “one family’s hunger for wealth” hurt the nation , and added that the Sonia Gandhi-headed trust had received donation from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) when the UPA government was in power at the Centre.However, dismissing Nadda’s charges, the Congress had said the the BJP was trying shift the focus from the Chinese issue. “The diabolical game of deception, diversion and disinformation is being played out by the BJP and JP Nadda to divert the attention of the country from the Chinese occupation of Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso and now Depsang up to the Y-junction, 18km inside the LAC,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said on Friday. On Saturday, Nadda added that the RGF received donations from tax havens of Luxembourg every year from 2006 to 2009. He also questioned why the RGF accounts were refused for CAG auditing and why the RTI was not applicable to the foundation.There has been an ongoing war of words between the BJP and the Congress for quite some time now –first on the issue of coronavirus situation in the country and lately , on the face-off between the Indian and Chinese troops at the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15. Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi has accused Centre’s Modi government of giving away Indian territory to the Chinese while Sonia Gandhi has said that the current crisis is a result of ‘mismanagement’ of the BJP-led NDA government and the ‘wrong policies’ pursued by it. In three video messages released back-to-back on Friday afternoon, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, son Rahul and daughter Priyanka stepped up attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the India-China border standoff and asked the government to take people into confidence on the extent of territories being occupied by Chinese troops.However, defending the central government, BJP chief JP Nadda on Saturday said that the armed forces are fully capable of protecting India, keeping the country safe and secure under Prime Minister Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-chief-jp-nadda-continues-attack-on-congress-sonia-gandhi/story-fyjREhsnfEDdMHdIAUbTuM.html

I have decided to devote the rest of my life for changing Bihar after the worst ever humiliation I have had to face due to heart-ending sight of migrants from Bihar returning to the state braving untold miseries,” he added.Flanked by former ministers in Nitish Kumar Cabinet Renu Kushwaha, Narendra Singh, former Jehanabad MP Arun Kumar, five-time MP from Jhanjharpur Devendra Prasad Yadav, former MP Purnmasi Ram, former union minister Nagmani and a host of other leaders, including Asfaq Rehman, Imtiyaz Ahmad and former MLA Sidhnath Rai, Sinha said more leaders were in touch with him to give the people of Bihar a viable alternative, “as they were badly looking for one after feeling cheated”. Former Bihar Speaker Uday Naraayan Choudhary is also said to be in touch with Sinha.“If this is the condition of Bihar 73 years after independence that every year 40-lakh people have to move out in search of livelihood, it speaks a lot about governance. If Bihar remains at the bottom of the human development index (HDI) index and poverty index, has the lowest per capita income of Rs 47541, which is one-third of the national average, and the education and health sectors remain in a deplorable state, there is not much left to explain,” he added.Himself an alumni of Patna Univeristy, Sinha said the university had been left with barely one or two teachers in several post-graduate departments, as most of the posts had remained vacant in Bihar’s higher education institutions. In the last fiscal, barely 33% of the rural road construction target could be completed. Bihar has barely 1.5% share in industries across the country. And to top it all, there is all-pervasive corruption, with money disappearing from treasury,” he said, in a direct attack on the Nitish Kumar government.He also urged the Election Commission to consider the prevailing situation before deciding whether it would be proper to hold elections. “Virtual campaigns and digital voting are mere tools of cheating the people. It will be heavily loaded in favour of rich parties. Besides, one never knows what shape Covid-19 would take. It may peak in October-November. Right now, there is hardly any testing in Bihar, but the figure has gone past 8,000. There will also be flood scenario in 21 districts. The EC has to take a call taking everything into consideration,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/yashwant-sinha-throws-hat-into-electoral-battle-to-change-bihar/story-ams3PWs9FTH7nRQOGLuuzN.html

27-06-2020||India||Covid-19: As India records highest daily spike, Govt underlines recovery rate at 58%, mortality rate at 3%||While India created another unenviable record of registering highest single-day spike in coronavirus cases in the country with over 18.5 thousand cases registered in the last 24 hours, the Union health ministry on Saturday provided a more optimistic appraisal of the state of affairs in the country’s fight against Covid-19 pandemic outbreak.Health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan underlined India has 58% recovery rate from the disease, which translates to close to 3 lakh recoveries out of the total caseload of 5,08,953 recorded so far since the outbreak. His ministry also pointed out that India’s mortality rate due to the contagion was only 3% and the doubling rate was close to 19 days, a big departure from 3-days recorded before a nationwide lockdown was clamped in the country earlier this year on March 25.“Our recovery rate has gone above 58% and around 3 lakh people have recovered from COVID19. Our mortality/fatality rate is near 3% which is very less. Our doubling rate has come down to nearly 19 days, which was 3 days before the lockdown,” Harsh Vardhan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also Watch | Covid update: 60% infections in June; notice over Coronil trials; PM lauds UP CM For Coronavirus Live UpdatesIndia is currently the fourth worst affected country in terms of total number of infections with the United States, Brazil and Russia faring even worse on that count. However, if one were to look at the total number of casualties, India ranks 8th on the list with Russia being the only country with fewer deaths but a higher number of cases than India. Death toll in India is at 15,685, according to the latest health ministry data released on Saturday.While the government has cited figures to show that the doubling rate has increased, it remains worrying that while it took 110 days for coronavirus infections in the country to reach one lakh mark, it took just 39 days more to go past the five-lakh mark on June 27. There has been a rise of 3,18,418 infections in just 17 days beginning June 1, according to data put out by PTI. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19India still has 1,97, 387 active cases and the rising trend of the disease is showing no signs of abating. The silver lining comes from the relatively low fatality rate and high recoveries of patients, which stands at 2,95,880 as of Saturday. India is also 4th on the list of recoveries behind USA, Brazil and Russia as per data available on Worldometers.info. Experts have pointed out that a high recovery rate sometimes can be misleading as it can have a direct relation with a high number of positive cases in a territory. For example, the USA’s recovery rate is currently over 40% but it also has the most number of infections at 2,553,068. Brazil with 1,280,054 cases has even a better recovery rate of over 54%, which translates to close to 69 thousands recoveries, as per data available on Worldometers.info.India definitely ranks better than the USA, Brazil and Russia when it comes to total cases per million of population, while the USA has 7,714 cases per million, Brazil has 6,023 cases per million and Russia has 4,301 cases per million against India’s 370 cases per million, which is amongst the lowest in the world. On this parameter, India ranks 117th amongst the over 210 countries, affected by the virus.Experts, however, have said that this should be seen in the context of the total number of tests conducted per million of the population. According to the Indian Council of Medical Research, India has tested 79,96,707 samples up to June 26 with 2,20,479 samples being tested on Friday, the highest in a day since the beginning of the pandemic. Despite the increasing number of tests being conducted, India ranks 139th in terms of tests conducted per million of the population. India has conducted 5,795 tests per million of the population which is significantly low in comparison with other table toppers like the USA- 94,733 tests/million, Brazil- 13,766 tests/million and Russia- 128,140 tests/million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-latest-govt-highlights-58-recovery-and-3-mortality-rate-as-india-lists-highest-daily-spike/story-SuwefQuJ1vliA2mCBBoLUP.html

By triggering the standoff when the world is figting the coronavirus pandemic, China has exposed itself globally,” former Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Gurmit Singh said.“The cost for China will be huge. It will be heavy. It will keep paying the cost for several decades for killing Indian soldiers in Galwan valley on June 15. China has lost its goodwill in India and elsewhere,” he added.Referring to brutal attacks on Indian soldiers in the Galwan valley, he said the action has reinforced the view that China’s People’s Liberation Army is “just a political” force and that it does not conform to military standards.Former Deputy Chief of Army Staff Lt Gen Subrata Saha too said China is getting itself isolated by its unacceptable military aggression and the country will have to pay a heavy diplomatic and economic price for it.“China is isolating itself by its aggressive conduct both militarily and diplomatically. So there will be a price for it. It is putting itself into a corner,” he said.Lt Gen Saha said there will a significant economic price that China will have to pay for its “misadventure”.He also referred to growing international concerns about what is happening in Hong Kong, South China Sea as well as in East China Sea.Gen Saha also talked about trade war between China and the US calling it a kind of “fight to finish” conflict. He also referred to China’s deepening trade crisis with Australia. The Indian and Chinese armies are locked in a bitter standoff in multiple locations in eastern Ladakh for the last six weeks, and the tension escalated manifold after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent clash in Galwan valley on June 15. Following the Galwan vally clashes, the Army has sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the Line of Actual Control in various sectors including in Arunachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Sikkim.The IAF has also moved a sizeable number of its frontline Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar, Mirage 2000 aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to several key air bases including Leh and Srinagar following the clashes.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9.Prior to the clashes, both sides had been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it was necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/galwan-clash-huge-mistake-by-china-world-already-fighting-covid-19-experts/story-Zhw1Hi0D18t24B3h86hCOP.html

With the advent of monsoon, the Indian side will need to evaluate whether the movement of pilgrims is possible through the corridor in a safe and secure manner, the people added.The Kartarpur Corridor, which links Dera Baba Nanak in India’s Gurdaspur to Durbar Sahib gurdwara in Pakistan, was opened on November 9 last year.The Pakistani statement said necessary health precautions are being taken regarding the corridor and the Pakistani side has invited India to work out standard operating procedures (SOPs) for the reopening. The statement also said the opening of the corridor on the eve of the 550th birth anniversary of Guru Nanak fulfilled a long-standing desire of the Sikh community and was appreciated by Sikhs across the world.The Indian government last year agreed to the opening of the corridor despite security concerns and opposition to a service fee of $20 charged from every Indian pilgrim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-reopens-kartarpur-corridor-next-week-india-seeks-experts-view/story-mOToSQdwRGlOIoQ2Ltgq3K.html
27-06-2020||India||For treating moderate to severe Covid-19 cases, govt adds dexamethasone||An inexpensive, widely used steroid dexamethasone was included in the treatment protocols for Covid-19 patients in moderate to severe stages of illness among other therapeutic measures by the Union health ministry on Saturday.The updated protocol includes the advice to use dexamethasone as an alternative choice to methylprednisolone for managing moderate to severe cases of Covid-19. The change has been made after considering the latest available evidence and expert consultation, the ministry said.According to the revised ‘Clinical Management Protocols for Covid-19’,  dexamethasone which is already used in treating lung infections besides in a wide range of conditions for its anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant effects can be used as an alternative to methylprednisolone which already existed in the treatment guidelines.  The health ministry on June 13 had also allowed the use of antiviral drug remdesivir for restricted emergency use and off-label application of tocilizumab, a drug that modifies the immune system or its functioning, and convalescent plasma for treating Covid-19 patients in moderate stage of the illness as an “investigational therapy”. It also recommended hydroxychloroquine in patients during the early course of the disease and not on critically ill patients.  The use of these drugs continues to be included in the revised treatment protocols under the ‘investigational therapy’.The revised treatment protocols for moderate cases advised considering methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 mg/kg or dexamethasone 0.1 to 0.2 mg/kg for three days, preferably within 48 hours of admission or if oxygen requirement is increasing and if inflammatory markers are increased. The duration of administration should be reviewed as per clinical response.For patients having respiratory distress requiring mechanical ventilation, both non- invasive and invasive, the ministry said methylprednisolone 1 – 2mg/kg/day or dexamethasone 0.2 to 0.4 mg/kg per day should be considered for 5-7 days in two divided doses, if not given already.“Note that a larger dose of glucocorticoid will delay the removal of coronavirus due to immunosuppressive effects,” the treatment protocols stated.The revised treatment protocols were issued as India’s Covid-19 tally raced past the five-lakh mark on Saturday with the biggest single-day surge of 18,552 cases while the death toll climbed to 15,685 with 384 fatalities, the updated figure at 8 am showed.   According to WHO, the corticosteroid dexamethasone was tested in hospitalised patients with Covid-19 in the United Kingdom’s national clinical trial ‘RECOVERY’ and was found to have benefits for critically ill patients.  According to preliminary findings shared with WHO, for patients on ventilators, the treatment was shown to reduce mortality by about one-third, and for patients requiring only oxygen, mortality was cut by about one-fifth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-ministry-adds-steroid-dexamethasone-in-covid-19-treatment-protocol/story-DA5jfbica6voMWrc08PTGI.html

I want the PM to condemn China. We will support the government.

What was the reason that he gave this statement. Was it because he was afraid that people would think that he could not protect India’s integrity?

27-06-2020||India||Sanjay Jha to contest when Congress decides to hold polls for its top body||Sanjay Jha, dropped as Congress spokesperson last week after he wrote an article which showed the party in poor light, on Saturday tweeted that he is “throwing his hat in the ring” as a candidate for the Congress Working Committee - the highest decision-making body in the grand old party. “As and when there are elections ( hopefully soon) to the Congress Working Committee ( CWC), I am throwing my hat in the ring,” tweeted Jha. The protracted leadership debate in the Congress rolls even a year after Rahul Gandhi resigned from the top party post taking responsibility for the dismal show in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. As a stop-gap arrangement, Sonia Gandhi was then named the interim Congress president. She, however, continues to be so till date.  As and when there are elections ( hopefully soon) to the Congress Working Committee ( CWC), I am throwing my hat in the ring. As a hard-core Nehruvian, am committed to rebuilding the party to take on the formidable machine and efficient might of the BJP.Jha, Mumbai-based former banker-turned-Congress spokesperson, underlined that he is a “hardcore Nehruvian” and will take on the “might of the BJP”.“As a hard-core Nehruvian, am committed to rebuilding the party to take on the formidable machine and efficient might of the BJP,” Jha added.Writing an opinion piece in a leading newspaper, Jha predicted the Congress’s political oblivion because of its “extraordinary lassitude and lackadaisical attitude”.“It is a false claim that there exists a robust internal democratic process that listens to individual voices, and more importantly, is continuously focused on party renewal, political strategy, tactical warfare, leadership development and resuscitation starting at the grassroots, the erstwhile USP of the Congress,” he wrote in the article.His comments once again brought the focus back on the leadership issue. Several suggestions, including from Shashi Tharoor, to have an elected party president have been met with silence.Zoya Hasan, who taught at JNU and authored a book on the Congress, says there is a larger problem with the party. “I can’t comment on who is leaving or not leaving. That’s been going on for a long time. The basic problem is that Congress doesn’t have a full time president for more than a year which should be unacceptable at any time but more so when the ruling party has a strong leader and the leading opposition party has none. It’s odd for a party to have an interim president (Sonia Gandhi) and de facto president (Rahul Gandhi) but no full time president. No political party can function without a full time president.”At the CWC held earlier this week, Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said the time has come for Rahul Gandhi to once again take over the reins of the organisation. A Congress leader familiar with the development said Gehlot’s suggestion was endorsed by former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat. However, no other CWC member spoke on the matter, he added.Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala and general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal denied that the issue was discussed at the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sanjay-jha-to-contest-when-congress-decides-to-hold-polls-for-its-top-body/story-4FQjYJs2BCp4rhwbphiMbP.html

Champat Rai, the VHP’s national vice president and also general secretary of Sri Ram Janmabhoomi Tirath Kshetra Trust, also attended the meeting. “In the meeting, it was decided to connect Hindus with the construction of Ram Mandir. After much deliberation, it was decided that the only way to ensure this was by carrying out Kar Seva,” a VHP leader present in the meeting said.“We are waiting for directives from saints to start Kar Seva for the construction of Ram Mandir,” Ambrish, the VHP’s regional organisation secretary, said.The leaders decided that the steps will be carried out after the Bhumi Pujan at Ram Janmabhoomi. However, they said, Kar Seva will only be carried out when the coronavirus pandemic subsides.Another important decision taken at the meeting was to carry out crowdfunding for the construction of the temple.“There is no shortage of funds for the construction of Ram Mandir. But we want to ensure the participation of all Hindus in the construction of the Ram Mandir. We will ask for Rs 10 donation from every individual,” Rai said. The temple, the leaders decided, would be constructed according to the existing model which was approved by the VHP during the temple movement in the 1990s.Some saints had been demanding changes in the existing model.Suggestions by some saints to use marble from Udaipur and Makrana in Rajasthan for temple construction instead of carved stones lying at Sri Ramjanmabhoomi Nyas Karyashala in Ayodhya were also rejected. Vinayak Rao Deshpande, VHP’s organisational general secretary, and Dinesh who uses one name, the member of the management committee, were also present in the meeting among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kar-seva-crowdfunding-in-vhp-s-plan-for-ram-temple-construction/story-uQwzM6li7B40obZJbNJZNK.html

27-06-2020||India||Environmentalists object Chhattisgarh govt’s move to proceed with Bodhghat project||Environmentalists have raised objection to the Chhattisgarh government’s move to conduct a survey for the multi-purpose Bodhghat project on the Indravati river in a bid to provide irrigation facilities to farmers in the three Communist Party of India (Maoist)-hit districts of the Bastar region.The project, which is estimated to cost Rs 22,000 crore and likely to generate 300 megawatt (MW) of hydel power, seeks to construct a dam near Barsoor village in Dantewada district to irrigate 3,66,580 hectares (ha) of farmland in Maoist–affected Dantewada, Bijapur, and Sukma districts.The state government has entrusted the responsibility to conduct the survey, research and obtain requisite approvals from various ministries to WAPCOS Limited, a consultancy organisation and public sector undertaking (PSU) under the Union Ministry of Jal Shakti.Earlier, though the project had got the environmental nod in 1979 for the generation of hydro-power, when the area was still under an undivided Madhya Pradesh (MP), the work never got started because the then government had felt that the venture was not suited for the tribal-dominated people in the Bastar region.Now, the project has been modified into an irrigation project that aims to provide water to thousands of parched villages under the Bastar division.“The project’s survey started a few days ago. Earlier, it was conceived as a hydel project, but the state government stalled it owing to protests among the local tribals in the Bastar division over displacement and deforestation fears. It is being developed as an irrigation project. All necessary approvals will be taken afresh from the Central government,” said Ravindra Chaubey, state minister for agriculture and water resource.Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel held a meeting with public representatives of the Bastar region on June 20 to discuss the implementation of the Bodhghat project and also sought their feedback and opinion. “The CM told us that the people of Bastar have not been directly benefitted for all these years because of the setting up of any new industries and business ventures. However, this project will be a game-changer for the local tribal population,” said a tribal leader, who was present on the June 20 meeting, requesting anonymity.A senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) official, who was also present at the meeting and privy to the development, said that the 300-MW generated from the project would be solely utilised for lifted irrigation, or a mechanised water flow, because the Bastar region has poor irrigation facilities.“Only 4.6% of farmland in the Bastar division has an irrigation facility. The region suffers from drought, despite dense vegetation. The Bodhghat irrigation project aims to cover 72% of arable land in Bastar in a major fillip to agriculture activities,” Choubey said. However, the project will also lead to a submergence of 42 villages and wipe out 5,704 ha of forests, 5,010 ha and 3,068 ha of private and government land, respectively.The bureaucrat said 500 million cubic metres of water would be used for Bastar-based industries.Activists working for tribal rights in Chhattisgarh said discussions about the projects must be done at gram-sabha level.“This is a welcome step that the government have started consulting with the public representatives of the Bastar region on the Bodhghat project. The gram sabhas and villagers should also be consulted,” said Alok Shukla, convener, Chhattisgarh Bachao Andolan, a pressure group that was formed in 2009 and focuses on people’s issues in the mineral and forest-rich state.He cited that the project was stalled earlier because of fears over its adverse ecological impact.“It is the state government’s priority to provide irrigation facilities in the Bastar region, but it shouldn’t happen at the expense of the environment and the local tribal population,” he said.Manish Kunjam, a local Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and also a tribal, however, claimed that the project is a non-starter, as it wouldn’t be able to provide irrigation facilities in the region.“The places that the state government seeks to make canals to irrigate the farmlands are inaccessible because of the Maoist insurgency and also the hostile terrain. No official has visited these areas after salwa judum (an anti-Maoist militia) because of the Maoist rebels,” said Kunjam.He demanded that the state’s tribal advisory committee should first approve the project because it is being constructed in tribal-dominated areas.Choubey said that CM Baghel has assured rehabilitation of the affected local tribal population and representatives of gram sabhas would also be consulted.“The displaced will getter better houses and land as compensation than their existing assets,” the minister added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/environmentalists-object-chhattisgarh-govt-s-move-to-conduct-survey-for-bodhghat-project/story-A84b944V551TLZBCujKCtM.html

Nadda had, in a series of tweets, said “one family’s hunger for wealth” hurt the nation, and also accused the Congress of committing a “brazen fraud” by diverting public money into a “family-run foundation”. RGF is a trust chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi.“Mr Nadda, come to terms with reality, don’t live in the past that is distorted by your half-truths. Please answer our questions on Chinese intrusion into Indian territory,” Chidambaram tweeted.“Suppose RGF returns the Rs 20 lakh, will PM Modi assure the country that China will vacate its transgression and restore status quo ante?” he asked.“BJP President Mr Nadda specialises in speaking half-truths. My colleague Mr Randeep Surjewala exposed his half truths yesterday.”Before Chidambaram’s satellite image tweet, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, party leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra had stepped up attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the India-China border standoff.They had asked the government to take people into confidence on the extent of territories being occupied by Chinese troops.Other senior party leaders such as Ahmed Patel, Ghulam Nabi Azad, Chidambaram, along with all Congress Working Committee members, party state chiefs and legislative party leaders have also issued videos. On its part, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has been attacking the Congress for allowing even more incursions during their regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/spot-the-difference-chidambaram-tweets-satellite-image-to-attack-govt-over-india-china-border-issue/story-chtdBYY4kT2hy3htfM531M.html

We have submitted a memorandum to the Governor as to what should be done for the farmers, women and other people during this time,” he added.CPI-M leader Ali Kishor Patnaik said that the 13 parties gathered for protest are anti-BJP and anti-BJD parties.The CPI-M leader said that the parties in the memorandum have requested the state government to act and “save the life and livelihood of the common people”.“There are many charges of corruption against the state government on the question of purchasing masks, sanitisers and PPE kits. Huge money has been siphoned and what we have demanded is that there must be a high-level independent community to enquire on this. The state government must come out with a white paper on the expenditure incurred to meet the challenges of COVID-19,” Ali Kishor Patnaik told ANI.Alleging that the state government a ‘propaganda-based organisation’, he said that the state government solely believes in propaganda.“This government has expertise in publishing and publicising things -- this is a propaganda based organisation. They believe in propaganda than in real and practical work. One must learn the art of propaganda from this government. Whatever they have announced, they are not keeping their promise,” he said.Citing the announcement wherein the state government promised to give Rs 2,000 to migrant labourers after completing 14-day quarantine period, Ali Kishor Patnaik alleged that the money has not been provided to the panchayat level.“Why are they not distributing the money? It has not reached the panchayat level. It is propaganda that Odisha is the first state to do so. Declaring that it is the first state is one thing but the reality is something else,” he added.AAP Odisha Convenor Nishikant Mohapatra said that the next six months for the people of the state is going to be very tough and he criticised the state government for “a lack of plan to scheme”.“The state government has no programme for people who are suffering. The Governor has appreciated our demand and has assured us that he would do the needful at this juncture,” he said.As per the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Odisha has a total of 5,962 Covid-19 cases in the state as of Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13-opposition-parties-protest-against-odisha-govt-s-management-of-covid-19/story-ogEHktWqf1f9F9ncQsqJ1J.html

There is no need to get flustered. If you say no land was taken away and the truth is otherwise, it will be China’s gain,” he added.In a series of video messages released on Friday, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, son Rahul and daughter Priyanka stepped up attacks on the Modi government over the Ladakh face-off.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-another-jibe-at-centre-rahul-gandhi-says-pm-is-silent-government-has-no-plan-to-defeat-covid-19/story-QTL08irdzWU6w8dOTWlSVJ.html

27-06-2020||India||Organised armed gangs challenging state government, Nagaland Governor writes to CM||Concerned about the ‘precarious’ law and order situation in the state, Nagaland Governor RN Ravi has written to chief minister Neiphiu Rio on how half a dozen armed gangs are challenging the legitimacy of the state government.In a scathing four-page letter written on June 16, which has been seen by HT, Ravi mentions how the armed gangs have been running extortion rackets and spreading fear while the state machinery had failed to rein them in.“Day-to-day unrestrained depredations by over half a dozen organised armed gangs, brazenly running their respective so-called governments, challenging the legitimacy of the state government without any resistance from state law and order machinery has created a crisis of confidence in the system,” the letter read.Also read: House-to-house Covid-19 screening begins in DelhiWithout naming them, Ravi, who was appointed Governor in August 2019 and is also the Centre’s interlocutor for the Naga peace talks, mentions about the Naga rebel groups, most of whom are engaged in peace talks with Centre.“Law-abiding citizens are made miserable by rampant extortion and violence by the armed groups. State government development departments are under duress to give regular ransom to the armed gangs. The brazen display of firepower by the rival gangs for turf control drive the people to panic,” the letter said.Ravi mentioned how the gangs operate check gates at entry points to the state and levy an illegal tax on all goods entering Nagaland “with full knowledge of the state law and order machinery”. Commodities coming to Nagaland become exorbitantly expensive due to “gunpoint” extortions by the armed miscreants.Mentioning how a Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) report in 2018 pointed out “massive leakage of funds” from various government departments to the armed gangs, the Governor stated that there was a steady downslide in all parameters of development in Nagaland due to the siphoning of a large chunk of funds meant for development projects.Ravi expressed disappointment that despite advising the chief secretary and the director-general of police in January 2020 to constitute a special investigation team (SIT) to probe instances of extortion and kidnapping of people involved in the construction of national highways in the state, no action has been initiated.The letter mentioned of rampant encroachment and deforestation of reserve forest land by the armed miscreants who had even evicted forest officials and their families from their residential quarters and were staying and conducting operations from there.Citing police reports, Ravi mentioned that while some action has been taken against foot soldiers of these gangs, senior members have not been implicated. He pointed that even in cases of the Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act, where the minimum punishment prescribed is 5 years, the culprits are given 5-10 days sentence “often with the concurrence of the public prosecutor”.The Governor mentioned that despite raising these concerns with the chief minister and urging him to rein in the miscreants to restore rule of law, nothing has been done.“The scenario in the state is grim. The law and order has collapsed. The constitutionally established state government is being challenged on a day-to-day basis by the armed gangs who question the sovereignty and integrity of the nation while the instruments of law and order remain totally unresponsive,” the letter said.Ravi stated that in such a situation, he can no longer abstain from his constitutional obligation for law and order in the state and proposed that all important law and order decisions - like the transfer and postings of all officers entrusted with the maintenance of law and order of and above the district level - to be done after an approval from the Governor.“I also propose to periodically review law and order situation in the state and issue required lawful decisions. In order to instil and ensure accountability, I also prefer to review the annual performance appraisal reports of all such officers,” the letter read.The CM’s office has not given any official reaction to the Governor’s letter yet. Nagaland CM didn’t respond to calls and his office said no statement on the issue has been issued.The Nagaland government headed by Neiphiu Rio of the Nationalist Democratic Progressive Party (NDPP) was formed in March 2018. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a key constituent of the ruling coalition.Following the Governor’s letter, the Nagaland Police held a press briefing in capital city Kohima on Friday to give details on relevant actions taken.“We would like to highlight anti-extortion measures taken against underground factions (of rebel outfits) and other anti-social elements who are taking advantage of such fragile situation,” said IGP (Range) Lima Sunep Jamir.“Since 2015, a total of 893 criminal cases have been registered and 1,238 persons of various UG groups have been arrested for involvement in various crimes including Arms Act, Explosives Act, murder, abductions, extortion robbery,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/organised-armed-gangs-challenging-state-government-nagaland-governor-writes-to-cm/story-C6YPQWz4xEHW46STBpCVDP.html
27-06-2020||India||BJP hits out at Kamal Nath for his alleged role in Congress-China ties||The Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP) on Friday accused Madhya Pradesh Congress president Kamal Nath of playing a pivotal role in Congress-China’s relations by exorbitantly reducing import duty on about 250 items when he was the union minister for commerce and industries during the UPA government.BJP national vice-president Prabhat Jha told the press that media had made a big disclosure as to why Congress and its leader Rahul Gandhi were speaking the language of China when there was India-China standoff at the border.Also read: Over 5 lakh people infected with coronavirus in IndiaJha said, “Former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh Kamal Nath played a key role in this. If I say in my own language that he was working as an agent of China, I will not be wrong… To reduce import duty on 250 such items which had an import duty of 100% to 200% and are available in India in plenty and thus the money received in return being given to the Congress party and Rajiv Gandhi Foundation is a national crime. The responsible person for this is the then commerce and industries minister Kamal Nath. This is all in records.”For instance, he said, the import duty on bamboo - which is available in India easily - was reduced to 10%. Similarly, on various items, it was reduced up to 40%. “That’s why Kamal Nath must answer to these charges. Otherwise, we will go to every locality to tell people why Rahul Gandhi was speaking the language of China what was Kamal Nath’s role in all this,” said Jha.Kamal Nath was not available for his comments. However, his media coordinator, Narendra Saluja, said, “Prabhat Jha is saying Kamal Nath ji worked as an agent of China when he was union minister. Jha should study Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s visits to China in September 2011 and June 2016. He should also look at Chouhan’s tweet on June 26, 2016, as to how he had pleaded for China’s assistance in development in the state and how he did special favour to China by giving land to Chinese companies in Peethampur. He should also remember that Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited China four times when he was chief minister of Gujarat and five times as the PM.”Earlier, questioning the link between China and the Congress, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday alleged that both the Chinese government and the Chinese embassy in India contributed to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) — a trust chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi with former prime minister Manmohan Singh, Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and P Chidambaram as trustees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-hits-out-at-kamal-nath-for-his-alleged-role-in-congress-china-ties/story-KMXHYT1brixPVgiQjRLkSO.html

27-06-2020||India||Serological survey to begin in Delhi today: All you need to know||Authorities in Delhi will start a mammoth campaign on Saturday to determine the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) amidst a rising number of cases in the national capital.The serological test or sero-surveillance study is a part of the new Covid-19 response plan prepared by the Centre for Delhi.Delhi, which has overtaken Mumbai as the worst-affected city in the country has 73,780 infections so far and 2,429 people have succumbed to the disease.Here is all you need to know about the serological survey:What are serology tests and serological surveys?A diagnostic method, serological tests are used to identify antibodies, which are created by the immune system when someone is infected with the virus, and antigens in a person’s blood. It may be performed to diagnose infections and autoimmune illnesses. It can also be conducted to check if a person has immunity to certain diseases.Serology (antibody) tests are largely used for surveillance among communities and can be used on people who have already been tested positive for the virus or even those who are asymptomatic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageEpidemiologists often use serological surveys to determine who has antibodies and find out who has been infected with the virus, even if someone never reported a positive test or experienced symptoms. “Depending upon the level of seroprevalence of infection, appropriate public health interventions can be planned and implemented for prevention and control of the disease. Periodic serosurveys are useful to guide policymakers,” an official of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had said earlier.When will it be conducted?The serological survey will be done throughout Delhi between June 27 and July 10 to enable authorities to undertake a comprehensive analysis of Covid-19 and then prepare a broad strategy to combat the pandemic in the national capital.“As per the directives of HM @AmitShah, discussion was done on the serological survey in Delhi, which will be carried out jointly by NCDC and Delhi Government. Survey will begin from June 27, training of all the concerned survey teams was completed yesterday,” a home ministry spokesperson tweeted on Friday.Who will conduct the survey?The National Centre for Disease Control, under the Union health ministry, and the Delhi government will jointly conduct the survey that will focus on antibody-based blood tests to find out residents’ past exposure to the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19.Where will it be done?The sero-surveillance study will be conducted in all the 11 districts of Delhi focusing on as many as 20,000 households on a random basis, including individuals below 18 years of age.How is it done?A serological survey includes IgG Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test. It estimates the proportion of the population exposed to Sars-Cov-2 infection. The IgG test is not useful for detecting acute infections but it indicates episodes of infections that has happened in the past. The test is approved by ICMR for its high sensitivity and specificity. Five millilitres of blood sample is collected from the subjects and then put in a machine where blood and plasma are separated. The plasma is then used to detect antibodies developed against Covid-19 in the body. Has it been done before in India?ICMR has in May conducted a pilot sero survey across 83 districts in 21 states. The results showed that the percentage of the general population to have been infected in the past was 0.73%, with urban areas having shown higher Covid-19 prevalence of about 1.09%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serological-survey-to-begin-in-delhi-today-here-s-what-you-need-to-know/story-21BcBryJVqX6ojgI1edHLI.html
27-06-2020||India||Delhiwale: The coolest guy in Khan Market||Cool people never say they are cool. They let others do the talking.This is precisely the case of Baldev. Enjoying a most enviable reputation in Delhi’s most upscale hang-out, he is known as the “coolest guy in Khan Market”. Or at least these exact words are glowingly painted on the wall just behind him.Baldev is a banana seller in Khan Market, since 1984. This morning, too, he is stationed by his pavement stall.Dismissing the flattering description on the wall, the turbaned (and masked) man shrugs, telling in a monotonous tone that “somebody came and painted that last year, or may be the year before that.”The gentleman has a poetic way of measuring time. This is how he discloses his age: “Do kum sattar (two less from 70)”.After the manners of truly classy and self-assured people, Baldev doesn’t feel the need to clothe himself in the opinions of others. He doesn’t think much of being considered “cool,” he says, but does modestly inform that shoppers often come to click his photos. He is popular, he suggests.In some sense, Baldev’s life is a mirror reflection of thousands of men who make their living in the metropolis as fruit vendors. Raised in the backwaters of Sultanpur, UP, he arrived in Delhi in the early 1980s and lives with two sons in a rented housing in south Delhi’s Kotla village. Every morning he gets a fresh stock of bananas from a warehouse, after which he pedals to Khan Market, where he stays until evening. The bananas are arranged picturesquely on his cycle, with a straw basket each placed on the handle bar and on the back carrier.Baldev recalls that he had originally chosen this area for his operations not because of Khan Market “but because the building over there used to have many government offices.” He waves his arm towards the multi-storey Lok Nayak Bhawan. “People working there were my customers.... they would come in great numbers to my stall throughout the day.”Most of those offices moved out of the building a long time ago, he mutters. “Now my customers are market people.”Soon, an auto rickshaw driver arrives to get a couple of bananas. After dispatching him off, Baldev turns to look at the painted words on the wall. “I usually stand across the road, but these days it’s hot… so I’m staying here in the shade.”He starts to readjust his fruit.You certainly ought to consider stopping by Baldev for bananas, but the more important reason to visit him is the fact that he is a living landmark of Khan Market — a destination so unique in the Capital that is as much loved (for its Partition-era origins, its longtime shops, its restaurants) as it is derided (for its so-called opulence and snobbery). The market has drastically changed its character over time, and also recently, with the closure of popular cafes and showrooms due to the coronavirus-related crisis. But it continues to hold on to its Baldev, who, along with a handful of shops, links Khan Market’s present to its past.You will find him in the market’s  periphery, where the middle lane meets St Luke Marg, next to a coffee chain outlet  that earlier used to be an Asian speciality restaurant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-the-coolest-guy-in-khan-market/story-yHp39cpbjTHrhhQPGEwybI.html
27-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know to today||Tamil Nadu on Thursday crossed the million mark in terms of number of Covid-19 tests. It was the first state to do so. That translates to around 15,000 tests per million of population (or 1.5% of the population), lower than Delhi’s 23,000+ and even Andhra’s 15,000+, but still among the highest in the country. The number is also much lower than that in some of the countries ravaged by the coronavirus disease — the US, UK, Spain, Russia, Italy, that have all tested between 8% and 12% of their population -- but it is still higher than the national average in India of around 5,834 tests per million of population.The state has rapidly increased testing. On June 11, it carried out only 16,829 tests. By June 25, this number increased to 32,543. And its daily positivity rate hasn’t changed much. This is a measure of the number of positive tests to the total tests, expressed as a percentage, and it has gone from 11.14% on June 11 to 10.78% on June 25. The lowest daily positivity rate for the state in this period was 7.21% on June 20, and the highest was registered on June 11.There are minor daily variations, but across a fortnight, Tamil Nadu’s daily positivity rate has hovered between 7.2% and 11.14%, with a median (middle) value of around 10%. And this, even as the number of tests have doubled.Tamil Nadu may well be the first state in India to be testing enough. Its positivity rate is following the trend (described previously in this column) — an increase, then a plateau, and then, finally, as a country, state or city begins testing adequately, a decline. Still better, the positivity range is exactly what the World Health Organization and experts at the Harvard Global Health Institute recognise as adequate.The chart accompanying this column shows the number of daily tests and cases and the positivity rate for the state for the past fortnight. Tamil Nadu recorded almost 71,000 Covid-19 cases till June 25, around 3,500 on that date alone. Of this number, 911 have died, and almost 40,000 recovered — a case fatality rate of 1.26% and a 2.22% death rate when closed cases (deaths and recoveries) are taken into account.The trend could change — as this writer has previously said, it makes sense to study one over a sustained period, say, eight weeks — but based on current evidence, Tamil Nadu seems to have got its hands (and more importantly, head) around the large-scale optimisation problem that is the management of Covid-19. The number of tests, cases, hospital beds, ventilators, health care professionals, people under home isolation, and volunteers, are all in the mix, and it is now clear that any district, city, state, or country that manages to crack this optimisation problem can get the better of the coronavirus disease.But even this level of testing may not ultimately indicate the prevalence of the coronavirus disease in a population. On Thursday, the US CDC said that only a tenth of the cases in the US may have been identified and recorded. That would mean around 10% of the country’s population was infected and mostly recovered without realising it (or died, in a few instances, without their deaths being recorded as Covid-19 deaths). CDC, news reports suggest, may have based its assessment on an ongoing serological survey that tests for antibodies in the population. Smaller tests of this nature have been carried out in various parts of the US (and this column has mentioned them, including the one in NYC), but this is the first large-scale antibody test.Interestingly, Delhi will become the first Indian state/city to embark on such a test on Monday, with 20,000 randomly chosen individuals from various parts of the Capital being tested for the disease.It is about time that happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-to-today/story-Wcya4NnHezsRQgB1tVkJAP.html
27-06-2020||India||Punjab gets first woman chief secy, bureaucracy its first power couple||CHANDIGARH The ascent of Vini Mahajan, a 1987-batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, to the top bureaucratic position in Punjab is a story of many firsts. One, Mahajan is the first woman chief secretary of the state. Two, she is the wife of Punjab Police chief Dinkar Gupta. This is the first time a couple is holding the top administrative and police posts in the state, and perhaps the first time this has happened anywhere in the country. Gupta, a 1987-batch Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, was appointed as head of the state police in February last year. He was empanelled by the Appointments Committee of the Cabinet (ACC) last month for the post of director general or DG equivalent at the Centre.Three, this is the first time the chief secretaries of both Punjab and Haryana are women. In Haryana, 1983 batch IAS officer Keshni Anand Arora currently holds the top bureaucratic position. Anand Arora isn’t the state’s first woman chief secretary, though; that distinction goes to her elder sister Meenakshi Anand Chaudhary who was appointed chief secretary in 2005. Their sister, Urvashi Gulati, also served as the state’s chief secretary from October 2009 to March 2012.Four, in 1995, Mahajan was the first woman IAS officer to be posted as deputy commissioner (DC) in Punjab.An economics graduate from Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi, Mahajan also has a post graduate diploma in business administration from the Indian Institute of Management (IIM), Calcutta, where she was placed on the ‘roll of honour’ and later also received the ‘Distinguished Alumnus Award’. She served in Manmohan Singh’s Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) from 2005 to 2012, handling matters relating to finance, industry, commerce, telecom and IT. Her father, BB Mahajan, was also an IAS officer of the Punjab cadre.Mahajan has been appointed as the chief secretary, superseding five IAS officers senior to her. They are: KBS Sidhu (1984 batch), Arun Goel, C Roul, Kalpana Baruah Mittal and Satish Chandra (all four from the 1985 batch).Sidhu, the senior-most bureaucrat in Punjab, is due to retire in July 2021. Both Goel and Roul are currently on deputation to the Centre and Mittal is additional chief secretary, cooperation, in the state government. Chandra, who has three months left for retirement, is additional chief secretary, home.Before being appointed as chief secretary, Mahajan was additional chief secretary, investment promotion, industries and commerce, information technology, governance reforms and public grievances. She served as the chairman of the celebrations committee for the 550th anniversary celebrations of Guru Nanak Dev in 2019. She succeeds Karan Avtar Singh who is due to retire on August 31, and who has been posted as special chief secretary governance reforms and public grievances. People familiar with the matter said Singh’s exit was largely because of differences with senior ministers in the state, including finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal. Mahajan will have more than four years as the chief secretary if she continues in the office till her superannuation in October 2024.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-gets-first-woman-chief-secy-bureaucracy-its-first-power-couple/story-HOTxBL8CYUDeonkrc1pflL.html
27-06-2020||India||Over 5 lakh people infected with coronavirus in India||India’s number of Covid-19 infections crossed 500,000 on Friday, making the country one of only four where the tally has breached this milestone. Fatality and recovery numbers offer some signs that the outbreak is still under manageable levels, although experts warned that this control was fragile and the situation could drastically turn if citizens and the government are not careful.According to HT’s dashboard of state-level statistics, the total number of infections grew by 18,370 on Friday, and 383 new deaths were recorded. In all, the country now has had 509,306 infections and 15,689 fatalities, translating to a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 3.08%. Nationally, however, the total number of recoveries crossed 295,852 and -- on an average over the past week -- for every five people testing positive in a day, four were being discharged after recovery. In terms of total cases, Maharashtra continued to have the highest numbers – roughly twice of Delhi that has the second-most number of infections. Tamil Nadu, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh are the other states in top five. The states were ranked similarly if fatalities are taken as a parameter.According to experts, these trends could determine how the disease peaks, which is likely to be at different periods in different regions. “It will probably start peaking in the next few next few weeks in places like Mumbai and Delhi, but in other areas it may take a little longer time for the infections to stabilise. Herd immunity will take a longer period of time,” said Randeep Guleria, the director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), New Delhi, in an interview to HT.Guleria said in his assessment the country avoided being overwhelmed by going for an early lockdown, which helped create a gradual rise instead of a sharp surge of the kind seen in some early hot spot countries such as Italy.But the pace of the outbreak has still quickened. The latest 100,000 cases came in six days, compared to the eight days that it took for the 100,000 cases before that. “The surge was kind of expected, given our poor discipline in hygiene practices, it was too optimistic to believe that behaviour patterns will change in a few weeks. Masks and hand-washing are the way ahead as social distancing is difficult in densely populated areas, like urban slums,” said Dr V Ramana Dhara, additional professor, Indian Institute of Public Health, Hyderabad. India’s 509,306 cases is next only to Russia, Brazil and the United States – with the last two having crossed a million infections. In terms of absolute number of fatalities, India ranks eighth in the world.Italy, as an example of where the surge was overwhelming, has less than half the number of infections as India but more than twice the number of deaths. Among the top four, only Russia has been able to mitigate the pandemic more effectively than India, logging less than 9,000 deaths from among its over 620,000 cases.Brazil has roughly 2.5 times the number of infections as India but more than 3.5 times the number of deaths. The United States, now firmly at the top as the hardest hit by the pandemic, has five times the number of cases (over 2.5 million) and a fatality count that is a whopping eight times higher than India’s.The US saw a record number of new Covid-19 cases in a single day, with 37,077 reported on Thursday, according to the tracker maintained by Johns Hopkins University. Thursday’s tally eclipses the previous high on April 24, when 36,291 new cases were reported across the country.This, Guleria as well as Dhara, said was a good example of how things can quickly go out of hand if people do not maintain discipline. “The graph that was stabilising in the US is now going straight up, they had [close to] 40,000 cases in a day, the highest single day record. It is a classic example of people not realising their responsibility and whatever gains they had have now been lost,” Guleria said, adding that India must closely watch experiences of other countries to avoid making the same mistakes. “Unfortunately, there are very few good choices left, and neglecting them would be foolish — look at how the cases are exploding in Florida, Texas and Arizona in the US,” said Dhara, urging citizens to also ensure they do their part.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-covid-tally-now-500-000/story-PmNfmanjXYkmWm9Y6SiWIP.html
27-06-2020||India||Delhi riots: Prez approves L-G’s list of 11 spl public prosecutors||New Delhi: Delhi’s home department has issued a notification regarding the appointment of 11 special public prosecutors (SPPs) for all cases related to the February riots in north-east Delhi after President Ram Nath Kovind signed off on the list approved by Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal. Kovind’s intervention was required after Delhi Police, which comes under the L-G, and the state’s elected Aam Aadmi Party government were locked in confrontation over the appointment of the special public prosecutors. While the L-G approved the panel of the public prosecutors proposed by the Delhi Police, the Delhi government rejected it and created its own. The L-G , on May 29, referred the matter to President Kovind for reference. In case of a difference between the state’s elected government and the L-G, the latter has to refer the matter to the President, whose decision is binding on both.Senior police officers said on condition of anonymity that the President gave his decision in favour of the L-G, after which a notification was issued on Wednesday (June 24), appointing the panel of SPPs proposed by the Delhi Police. HT has reviewed a copy of the appointment order.A media advisor to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said the state government has to respect the President’s decision. “We opposed the move and demanded that an independent panel proposed by us be appointed. But now that the President has approved the panel recommended by the Police, the Delhi government has no option but to abide by the decision.” The L-G’s office did not respond to calls and messages seeking a comment on the matter.The notification, signed by Delhi’s deputy secretary (home) Pawan Kumar, says the appointment of the special public prosecutors has been done exercising “the powers conferred by sub-section (8) of section 24 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 (2 of 1974) read with the Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs notification...”It adds that the appointed SPPs “shall conduct all court proceedings including bail, trial, appeals, and all the miscellaneous matters incidental to and connected with all the FIRs which have been registered in respect of riots in north-east district (police district), Delhi or any other matter related to those FIRs).”The 11 appointed SPPs named in the notification are Manoj Chaudhary, Rajiv Krishna Sharma, Nitin Raj Sharma, Devender Kumar Bhatia, Naresh Kumar Gaur, Amit Prasad, Jinendra Jain, Anuj Handa, Ram Chander Singh Bhadoria, Uttam Datt and Salim Ahmad.“We have received the list of 11 special public prosecutors through the notification. They will represent us (Delhi Police) in the courts in the north-east Delhi riots cases,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Mandeep Singh Randhawa.The appointed SPPs will start appearing in the courts from Saturday( June 27), said an officer from the Delhi Police’s legal cell, requesting anonymity.A total of 53 people were killed and at least 400 were injured in the communal riots that ravaged several parts of north-east Delhi in February. Around 750 first information reports (FIRs) were filed and at least 1,300 people have been arrested in connection with the violence, prompted by clashes between two groups, one for the Citizenship Amendment Act and the other against. The clashes soon escalated into a communal clash between Hindus and Muslims. The police have thus far filed charge-sheets in nearly 100 cases. The confrontation between the L-G and the Delhi government over the appointment of SPPs began in April. A senior police officer associated with the investigation into the riots said the city police sent to the L-G’s office the list of a panel of public prosecutors. The L-G endorsed the police’s move and the file was sent to the Delhi government for perusal by home minister Satyendar Jain. The state government suggested that a panel of “independent and technically qualified” special public prosecutors to be appointed to represent the state. Jain formed a fresh panel of lawyers, and issued orders on April 16 that they be notified as the special public prosecutors.The Delhi Police subsequently withdrew its list and submitted a second list on April 24. This was rejected by the Delhi government with Jain reiterating his order of notifying the original panel suggested by him. Jain met the L-G on May 21, but the differences persisted. The L-G wrote to the government on May 23 and later invoked Article 239AA(4) of the Constitution (difference of opinion with the council of ministers) to refer the matter to the President.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-riots-prez-approves-l-g-s-list-of-11-spl-public-prosecutors/story-OgMJkCBQy4vpNrSdjR036M.html
27-06-2020||India||Children used by J&K terrorists, Maoists: US state dept report||Children as young as 14 are being recruited and used by non-state armed groups, or terror organisations, in anti-government activities in Jammu and Kashmir, according to a new report by the US state department. The Trafficking in Persons Report 2019, released on Thursday, also said children as young as 12 are forcibly used by Maoist rebels to handle weapons and improvised explosive devices (IEDs), and in some cases, act as human shields, elsewhere in India. Maoist rebels also engage in sexual slavery in their camps, said the report.The use of “child soldiers” for propaganda is particularly rampant in areas affected by left-wing extremism (LWE) in the states of Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, the report said.Claiming that India doesn’t fully meet the minimum standards in eliminating human trafficking, the US has kept the country in Tier 2 category of countries on the basis of its efforts to combat the practice . India has been placed in the Tier 2 category on human trafficking for almost a decade.To put things in context, the Tier 2 ranking is given to countries that have not fully complied with anti-human trafficking measures, but are making efforts to do so. Countries that have fully complied with the measures are in Tier 1. The report said physical violence against trafficking victims – in terms of both forced labour and sex trafficking – was prevalent in India and “some traffickers force women and girls to conceive and deliver babies for sale”.“Traffickers exploit millions of people in commercial sex within India. Traffickers target Indian women and girls but also fraudulently recruit significant numbers of Nepali and Bangladeshi women and girls to India for sex trafficking. Additionally, traffickers exploit women and girls from Central Asian, European, and African countries in commercial sex, especially in Goa,” the report said. “India is a source of child sex tourists and a destination for child sex tourism,” the report said.It added: “Traffickers kidnap and force Indian and Nepali women and girls to work as ‘orchestra dancers’ in India, especially in Bihar state, where girls perform with dance groups until they have repaid fabricated debts. Traffickers exploit women and children in sex trafficking in religious pilgrimage centres and in tourist destinations.”The report said human traffickers were increasingly using online technology to facilitate sex trafficking and fraudulent recruitment.“Some traffickers kidnap children from public places, including railway stations, entice girls with drugs, and force girls as young as 5 years old in sex trafficking to take hormone injections to appear older,” it said.Some corrupt law enforcement officers have a major role to play as they “protect suspected traffickers and brothel owners from law enforcement efforts and take bribes from sex trafficking establishments and sexual services from victims”, the report said. Not just that, the report noted that traffickers arrange sham marriages within India and West Asian states to subject females to sex trafficking.According to the report, the authorities have recently identified Indian forced labour victims in Armenia, Portugal, Gabon, and Zambia, and Indian female sex trafficking victims in Kenya.“Traffickers exploit Rohingya, Sri Lankan Tamil, and other refugee populations in sex and labour trafficking. Traffickers subject some boys from Assam, Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh states to forced labour in Nepal,” it added.Criticising the Indian government, the US state department said the “the government decreased investigations, prosecutions, and case convictions of traffickers, and the acquittal rate for traffickers increased to 83%”.It added: “Law enforcement decreased victim identification efforts, and the government reported it had only identified approximately 313,000 bonded labourers since 1976 — less than four percent of NGOs’ estimates of at least eight million trafficking victims in India, the majority of which are bonded labourers.”It added: “NGOs estimated police did not file FIRs {first information reports} in at least half of reported bonded labour cases, and inconsistent with NGO reports, 17 of 36 states and territories did not identify any bonded labour victims in 2017 or 2018.” Citing data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the report said that in 2018, the Indian government reported 1,830 trafficking cases under the Indian Penal Code (IPC), a continued decrease from 2,854 cases in 2017 and 5,217 cases in 2016.The US report has a specific mention of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the sexual abuse of girls and boys in shelter homes in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh.The CBI, the report said, completed investigations into the 16 most abusive shelters and filed charges in 12 additional cases. The CBI filed an additional 19 FIRs against some of the 94 other state-funded shelter homes in Bihar.“Despite this action in Bihar, the lack of investigations into suspected trafficking crimes and broader physical and sexual abuse of trafficking victims at government-run and -funded shelters in other states due to widespread negligence created an atmosphere of impunity for shelter employees and government officials to engage in trafficking,” the report said.The report blamed Indian police for the widespread impunity with which trafficking crimes are committed.“Some police and administration officials maintained the view that society had the right to put lower caste individuals in bonded and child labour, which sometimes impeded identification and investigation of such cases. NGOs across multiple states reported politically connected individuals, including local and state politicians who held workers in bonded labour in agriculture and on brick kilns, successfully avoided prosecution. Some law enforcement reportedly received bribes from sex trafficking establishments and sexual services from victims in exchange for alerting the traffickers of forthcoming raids,” it said.“The lack of sufficient political will across many states to address bonded labour stymied efforts nationwide,” it added.Prakash Singh, a former police chief of Uttar Pradesh, said: “The problem is definitely there. It is an acknowledged fact which has been accepted by the Indian government that Naxals {Moist rebels} use children for carrying items or even using them as informers.”Singh added, “Yes, Indian police have problems but they have a very thankless task to perform, where they have to follow orders of the political class. But I think Indian police are doing a better job than the US police.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/children-used-by-j-k-terrorists-maoists-us-state-dept-report/story-SMzUVKPCYSvopUk3z1HvSP.html

A terrorist fired at a CRPF patrol team on a highway in south Kashmir’s Anantnag’s Bijbehara area around 12:15pm, a police spokesperson said.Zahid Daas, a terrorist of the Jammu and Kashmir unit of the Islamic State, was involved in the Bijbehara attack, Kashmir inspector general (IG) Vijay Kumar said later in the day. The police filed a first information report (FIR) against Daas.“... [the attack] caused injuries to a CRPF trooper and a minor boy. Both were shifted to nearby hospital where they succumbed to their injuries,” a police spokesperson said.The six-year-old boy who died in the incident was identified as Nehan Yawar, the son of Mohd Yaseen Bhat, a resident of neighbouring Kulgam district.Senior police and army officers reached the spot and launched an operation in areas adjacent to the highway. “An innocent six-year-old boy is the latest victim of the violence in Kashmir...May Allah grant him Jannat & his family strength at this difficult time,” former Jammu and Kashmir chief minister Omar Abdullah tweeted.In Pulwama district’s Tral, forces launched an operation at Chewa Ullar on Thursday evening after receiving intelligence inputs about the presence of terrorists in the area.Officials said the first terrorist was killed early on Friday morning and two more were shot dead as the operation progressed. The terrorists, believed to be locals, were hiding in a house, which was damaged in the gunfight. IG Kumar said after the successful operation, there was no presence of the Hizbul, a local group, in the Tral area. “It has happened for first time since 1989,” he said.The police said the terrorists were given an opportunity to surrender. However, they fired indiscriminately on the search party, which retaliated, triggering a gun battle.The police said arms and ammunition including two AK-47 assault rifles, six AK magazines, five AK rounds, a pistol, a pistol magazine, and four pistol rounds were recovered from the site.The bodies of the three militants were sent to Handwara for conducting the last rites after medico-legal formalities, including the collection of DNA. Security forces have stepped up the offensive in Kashmir Valley and killed over 100 terrorists since the beginning of this year. Forty terrorists were killed in June alone, and most of them were killed in south Kashmir, which is considered the hotbed of militancy in the region. Among the major successes of security forces this year was the killing of Riyaz Naikoo, a top commander of the Hizbul, in an operation in Beighpora last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/crpf-trooper-6-year-old-killed-in-anantnag-attack/story-cFLnltIeFopI3i3yH3wpeM.html
27-06-2020||India||Delhi Gymkhana Club: NCLT orders setting up of panel||New Delhi: The National Company Law Tribunal on Friday asked the government to appoint two nominees to the governing body of Delhi Gymkhana Club as well as set-up a five-member committee to look into the alleged “irregularities”, officials told Hindustan Times. The NCLT in its verbal judgment also said that the Delhi Gymkhana club, which is in the midst of a take-over battle by the Centre, will be allowed to make no “new policy decisions, appoint new members and/or begin new constructions”. The next date of hearing has been set at 7 September when the five-member committee will submit its report. Delhi Gymkhana president Lt. Gen. D.R. Soni (retd.) said that the “club will work with whatever orders are issued”. “We will do our best to follow whatever orders are issued, earlier restrictions have been continued,” Soni told Hindustan Times. “This a big win for the government as the interim orders addresses the concerns that were raised,” an MCA official privy to the developments told Hindustan Times. The Delhi Gymkhana, which shares a wall with the Prime Minister’s residence, has been under investigation for around three years. The central government has cited “parivarwaad” (nepotism), financial irregularities, misuse of allocated land and issues related to membership as the primary reasons behind its move to acquire the Delhi Gymkhana Club. The ministry of corporate affairs (MCA) filed a petition, seen by the Hindustan Times, with the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) seeking to take over the premier club.The government had asked for the dissolution of the governing body and the appointment of an administrator as interim relief. Not all feel that the order favours the government. A former Delhi Gymkhana official told Hindustan Times that the order was “neither a win nor a loss for either side”.“The order is primarily saying two things – one, that the administration of Gymkhana is allowed to continue,” said the former Gymkhana official. “The two nominees that will be appointed will be filing two vacancies. So basically NCLT has said that the government will fill the vacancies.”The former Gymkhana official added that the second point was that the NCLT is not yet “convinced of all the irregularities”, and has hence, asked the government to appoint a five-member team. “The team is investigative in nature, not administrative,” the former official said adding that the case was still “wide open” and “could go anywhere”. A Gymkhana board member, however, said that the order “was not exactly a positive for the Club”. “The governing council has been allowed to function, which is a good thing considering it is a democratically elected body,” said the official. “But we have to realise that a handful of people who hold a grudge against the Club have caused all these troubles.” The official added that there was no clarity on the mandate of the committee or the observers that the government has been asked to appoint. “We will have to wait for the written order to understand the nuances.” “As a member for last 49 years, all I can say is that this is not tenable in a court of law. The case has a weak leg to stand on. Once the Club lawyers receive a copy of the judgment, they will be able to respond better,” said Sameer Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-gymkhana-club-nclt-orders-setting-up-of-panel/story-0Mho65Uq1k7CYt6HTO1MaN.html
27-06-2020||India||Nath’s nephew booked for fraud, CBI raids premises||New Delhi: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Friday carried out searches at multiple premises linked to Ratul Puri, his company Moser Baer Solar Ltd (MBSL), and his mother Nita Puri -- sister of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister Kamal Nath -- in connection with a fresh FIR registered against him on Thursday for allegedly cheating a consortium of banks led by Punjab National Bank (PNB) of Rs 787 crore, officials familiar with the matter said.The agency teams, wearing PPE (personal protection equipment), raided several buildings in Delhi and Noida.“In the view of Covid-19, all precautions regarding health and safety are being taken while conducting the searches including provision of PPE kits to all the search teams,” CBI spokesperson RK Gaur said.In the latest FIR, the agency has named Ratul Puri, his father Deepak Puri, mother Nita Puri, the firm MBSL, and six other directors – Bernhard Herrman Gallus, Sunita Mowdgal, Sanjay Jain, Rajesh Khandelwal, Deepak Khandelwal and Sunita Gupta -- as accused.Apart from PNB, Ratul Puri is accused if cheating six other banks -- State Bank of India, Union Bank of India, Exim Bank, Bank of Baroda, Indian Overseas Bank and Central Bank of India. He is also a key accused money laundering probe linked to the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper purchase scam.Ratul Puri was arrested in August last year and eventually released on bail in December.According to the latest FIR registered by CBI, as part of Corporate Debt Restructuring (CDR), MBSL got a total Rs 955 crore from PNB for solar power project based on Amorphous Silicon thin film. A forensic audit carried out by the banks alleged that instead of repaying the of banks’ dues, MBSL invested a sum of Rs 695 crore in Helios Photovoltac Ltd, a related company of MBSL, which had been booking losses since 2011-12.MBSL also made an interest-free security deposit of Rs 135 crore to Moser Baer India Ltd (MBIL), said the FIR, said.Subsequently, the FIR alleged, MBSL fraudulently disposed of the primary security of the lenders -- consisting of stock of finished goods, semi-finished goods and raw materials -- to prevent he distribution among the banks.The banks have calculated the total fraud at Rs 787 crore, which mostly took place in 2013-14.Puri’s lawyer Vijay Aggarwal declined comment. Former MP chief minister Kamal Nath last year accused the BJP of orchestrating raids by central agencies and claimed that the investigation against Ratul Puri was “political vendetta”.In August 2019, CBI registered a bank fraud case against Ratul Puri and Nita Puri 2019 for allegedly cheating Central Bank of India of Rs 354 crore.The Enforcement Directorate (ED) also accused Ratul Puri of involvement in bank frauds amounting to Rs 7,900 crore. In a charge sheet filed last October, ED alleged that Ratul Puri misused funds loaned from the bank to maintain a lavish lifestyle.The probe agencies have claimed that they had found printouts of emails that allegedly link Puri to corporate entities created to park money received as kickbacks in the AgustaWestland deal.The AgustaWestland case centres on allegations that bribes were paid to middlemen, perhaps even politicians, when India agreed to buy 12 AgustaWestland helicopters built by Italian defence manufacturing giant Finmeccanica (now known as the Leonardo group) at an estimated cost of Rs 3,727 crore in 2010.The deal was scrapped in 2014 over alleged breach of contractual obligations and charges of payment of kickbacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nath-s-nephew-booked-for-fraud-cbi-raids-premises/story-InxRkcackMWZptpOXknIRP.html
27-06-2020||India||Monsoon spreads across entire India||New Delhi: Monsoon covered the entire country by Friday, June 26 -- 12 days ahead of its normal pattern of spreading across India by July 8 -- due to a combination of weather phenomena, according to scientists from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).The last time the advance of the monsoon was this early was in 2013, when it covered the entire country by June 16, In 2013, this happened as early as June 16.“There were three weather systems on Friday which helped the monsoon advance. Even the arid regions of west Rajasthan got rain, as did the remaining parts of Punjab and Haryana. There was a cyclonic circulation over central Pakistan, another over north-east Rajasthan, and a trough of low pressure was passing through Rajasthan, Haryana, right up to Bihar and West Bengal. This helped bring thundershowers and rain even in very dry areas,” said K Sathi Devi, head of IMD’s National Weather Forecasting Centre (NWFC).HT had reported on Thursday that the northern limit of the monsoon (the northernmost boundary up to which monsoon rains have advanced) covered almost the entire country on Wednesday except a few parts of Rajasthan, Haryana and Punjab.“Thirty-one out of 36 subdivisions have received normal to large excess rain in June. Its good for sowing crops as June is the major sowing season for most parts of the country,” M Mohapatra, director general of IMD, said.Monsoon is said to have spread across the country when 36 subdivisions are covered.While the early advance is good news for the farm sector, scientists warned of intense rains in the eastern and north-eastern states for the next few days. There is a red warning for Bihar, Assam, Meghalaya, Sikkim, Sub Himalayan West Bengal and an orange warning for Arunachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Kerala and Tamil Nadu, for heavy to extremely heavy rain on June 26 and 27. While a red warning implies that authorities should take actions to prevent any rain related disaster, an orange warning implies that all authorities should be prepared to act if there is a disaster.The heavy rainfall prediction, according to the scientists, is due to the shifting of the monsoon trough northwards, and the convergence of strong southerly and south-westerly winds from the Bay of Bengal over north-east and east India. “During this period, there may be a reduction in rainfall in northwest and central India. But starting from east UP to all eastern and north-eastern states and south peninsula will get very good rains,” Sathi Devi said.The larger features ensuring a good start to the monsoon are a neutral El Nino and a neutral Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), the scientists said. El Nino is a climate pattern characterised by high sea surface temperatures in the tropical Pacific Ocean. El Nino years in India are linked to below-normal monsoon rains and a higher-than-normal frequency of heat waves. Last year, weak El Nino conditions prevailed, leading to a delayed onset of monsoon. IOD is characterised by warmer sea surface temperatures in the equatorial Indian Ocean, and positive IOD conditions are associated with normal monsoon over India.Monsoon progress was normal over south and east India, there was about a week delay over northeast India and 7 to 12 days early advance over central and northwest India according to IMD.A good monsoon, which accounts for 70% of India’s annual rainfall, is crucial for the agriculture sector, on which at least 700 million people in India depend on for livelihood. The monsoon is crucial for the yield of rice, wheat, sugarcane, and oilseeds in a country where farming accounts for about 15% of the economy but employs over half of its people.Monsoon over the country 21% in excess of the long period average (LPA) as on June 25 -- 12% over north-west India, 50% over central India, 7% over east and north-east India and 4% over south Peninsula.LPA is the average of rainfall received in the area over a 50-year period between 1961 and 2010 which is 88.06 cm.IMD has predicted a normal monsoon this year at 102% of LPA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-spreads-across-entire-india/story-ca4vdItilAQCP7GSeE1CKI.html

27-06-2020||India||IRCTC desk planned at Parliament house||New Delhi: Indian railway might stop serving Parliament canteens in the coming days, but the transporter’s catering arm, IRCTC, may soon open a ticket counter in Parliament complex—to help MPs buy air tickets of private domestic airlines.It is set to be the first outlet that will sell, among other things, tickets of different private carriers in the Parliament complex that had the presence of only public entities such as tea and coffee boards outlets, Indian railways-run canteen and an Air India counter. It will run parallel to the Air India counter, said a senior official. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla has given necessary orders to allow IRCTC to set up its booking counter, officials said. They also pointed out that in a special booklet highlighting achievements of Birla’s first year in office, it has been mentioned: “Orders have also been issued for setting up a new booking counter of IRCTC in Parliament House Complex to provide the facility of booking tickets for private air journeys by Hon’ble Members.”The idea to have a counter for all domestic airlines was mooted last year during a meeting of the Lok Sabha’s business advisory committee chaired by Birla. After several members pointed out the difficulties in getting tickets Birla asked the secretariat to look into the issue.An MP is entitled to 34 business class tickets annually in any airline. The entry of IRCTC may also dent Air India’s roaring business. According to officials and a couple of MPs, the national carrier’s counter provides mainly full fare tickets for the MPs—whereas buying tickets from outside or even agents can get lower rates.“I remember former Speaker Sumitra Mahajan once told us that she way flying from Delhi to Indore and she found that the passenger sitting beside her has bought the ticket at nearly 50% cheaper price,” said Trinamool’s floor leader Sudip Bandopadhyay who prefers to fly the Maharaja.The IRCTC outlet, according to officials can also end the inflated bills of travel agents who are often engaged by MPs as the lawmakers don’t have time to make their own bookings regularly. “according to rules, we have to pay for the entire amount of the bill. But some travel agents also add their commission,” said an official.“It will be a good move by the Speaker. After all, it will be convenient for all MPs to get their tickets during the session. and they don’t have to worry about the hassles,” Bandopadhyay added.Lok Sabha officials added that IRCTC counter is likely to open from the monsoon session. It might also coincide with the departure of the northern railways from the Parliament canteen as a part of the project to overhaul the catering system in Parliament.In last one year, the Lok Sabha secretariat revamped facilities for MPs in other sectors as well. 36 duplex flats for lawmakers came up in the North Avenue and another 228 new flats will be constructed.76 multi-storied residential flats are being built after demolishing seven bungalows located on B D Marg and one bungalow on the Talkatora Road. Birla has also set up an information and communication Center on the lines of a call centre for assistance of Members. The centre has received 21,000 calls so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/irctc-desk-planned-at-parliament-house/story-gcEplnRpVkOSyiOsdULD0I.html
27-06-2020||India||No talk of deferring Bihar elections at this moment: Sunil Arora||Chief election commissioner Sunil Arora, in an e-mail interview with Sunetra Choudhury and Deeksha Bhardwaj, speaks on the Bihar elections, how polling could change due to Covid-19, and on offering postal ballot facilities to those above 65 years and those in home/institutional quarantine due to the coronavirus disease. Edited excerpts:We saw a legislator found positive for Covid-19 voting in the recently held Rajya Sabha polls. Do you think it was a good idea? What are EC’s takeaways from the RS elections?Our electoral process has been inclusive and the commission always takes necessary measures to address any particular challenge so that it remains inclusive. Any elector found Covid positive needs to be facilitated, keeping the guidelines/instructions prescribed under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, in view for the purpose of voting without compromising on security, safety and transparency. Our polling team took all prescribed measures to facilitate voting of the elector (in the Rajya Sabha polls).Realising the changed environment, the commission on June 1 recommended to the ministry of law and justice amendments in the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961, to facilitate postal ballot for electors who are 65 years and above, and electors who are under home/institutional quarantine due to Covid-19 (in upcoming elections).On June 19, the ministry notified the amendments, as proposed by the commission. This is in addition to the existing postal ballot facilities for PwD (persons with disabilities) electors and electors employed in essential services.Will these initiatives be carried into the Bihar polls? When the ambit of the postal ballot is expanded, how do you ensure the sanctity/ security of the vote?In 2019, the commission facilitated postal ballot for electors above 80 years and PwD electors in select constituencies in Jharkhand, and in 2020, in all constituencies in the NCT (National Capital Territory) of Delhi. In the NCT of Delhi, people in essential services also exercised their right to vote using the postal ballot option. All these categories are extended postal ballot facilities following due procedures, with proper video-recording of the process, and keeping candidates informed at every stage. Hence, each postal ballot vote remains secure, safe and transparent.Is it now certain that elections for the Bihar assembly will go ahead as planned?At the moment, there is no consideration of deferring the conduct of Bihar elections. Necessary preparations are underway at the Election Commission of India (ECI), the state and the district levels.In Bihar, approximately 71.8 million electors will be casting their votes in approximately 97,000 polling stations.How do you foresee elections changing during a pandemic?Covid-19 has impacted the electoral process world over. Definitely, restrictions and social distancing will impact electoral activities on ground. Keeping these in view, the commission is contemplating a number of measures such as:(a) Number of electors per polling station will be restricted to a maximum of 1,000 (as opposed to the current limit of 1,600). Thus, auxiliary polling stations (PS) would be created (for the additional voters); for instance, 34,000 additional PSs are being planned for Bihar.(b) Campaigning and outreach by political parties and even ECI’s Systematic Voters’ Education and Electoral Participation (SVEEP) efforts will need to shift to digital mode to a larger extent.(c) While ECI is ensuring that all ECI guidelines pertaining to electoral machinery, voters, political parties, candidates and other stakeholders are tweaked, a reassessment of procedures at various stages of the election is being worked out by a team.(d) All advisories and guidelines issued by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), under the Disaster Management Act...shall be adhered to.(e) Our field functionaries need to account for all related instructions of managing the issues of Covid-19 at each stage of the electoral process.(f) All stakeholders including political parties will have to collectively ensure that the relevant safety guidelines issued by NDMA and public health authorities are followed in letter and spirit to ensure appropriate arrangements regarding social distancing, sanitization, disinfection, and masks/gloves etc.How will the model code of conduct change and adapt to the new digital mode of campaigning?The Model Code of Conduct (MCC) has evolved over a period of time in close consultation with the political parties, as a successful code of ethical behaviour in Indian elections. MCC consists of two parts: first, behaviour/activities which are already covered/regulated under existing statutes; and second, behaviour/activities not covered by any statute.In case of the enforcement of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, to mitigate the dangers of spread of Covid-19, the concerned election authorities will ensure the implementation of regulating specific behaviour/activities, which relate to elections...The commission has already established mechanisms to monitor digital environment for elections. There is a dedicated social media monitoring section in the commission, which monitors popular sites and deals with complaints received regarding misuse of social media for electoral purposes during election period. Hence, with a proper monitoring mechanism in place, shifting of campaign to the online mode would not affect the implementation of MCC.Is the Election Commission considering voting via mobile apps and online?The commission has not considered the option of voting via mobile apps and online.The Election Commission has been considering the prospect of “remote voting” for a couple of years now. With lockdowns in various states, do we see a prospect of that materialising? If yes, who all will be eligible?The focus of remote voting is on those voters who, for a variety of reasons, are unable to exercise their franchise; who move from their places of ordinary residence for purposes of education, medical treatment or a temporary vocation. Similarly, a large number of overseas electors are unable to cast their ballot. ECI has set up a Technology Advisory group, drawn from academic experts from IITs (Indian Institutes of Technology) and other premier institutions to guide the commission on futuristic models for voting. They are actively engaged in simulating a workable prototype which can be tested for remote voting application. Fundamentally, it must meet the test of transparency, secrecy of ballot, security of data and network. A remote voting cell is being set up in ECI, which will have the mandate to consult various stakeholders and experts for brainstorming on the efficacy of technology. I am confident that we would be able to test...such a prototype over the next few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-talk-of-deferring-bihar-elections-at-this-moment-sunil-arora/story-ECybXwyxkYwJb2PjVLzUEJ.html
27-06-2020||India||Mask is medicine until a vaccine is found, says PM||LUCKNOW Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked Indians on Friday to wear masks and maintain social distancing until a Covid-19 vaccine is not found, adding that the battle for ‘lives and livelihood’ would not stop until it was won.Speaking at the launch of the Atma Nirbhar Uttar Pradesh Rojgar Abhiyan” over video conference, Modi also attacked opposition parties over their handling of past crises while lauding Uttar Pradesh for its “hard work” in saving lives during the pandemic. “Go out for work but follow the two metre distance norm, put a mask on your face and maintain cleanliness to win the battle for lives and livelihood. We are not aware when we will get rid of Covid. But there is only one medicine. It’s maintaining two meter distance and wearing a mask. Till a vaccine is developed, we will be able to get protection ourselves with this medicine,” Modi said.The state job campaign, aimed at creating employment and infrastructure, is part of the ‘Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan’ that the prime minister launched on June 20 for 116 districts in six states. Thirty one of UP’s 75 districts are covered under the campaign.In his speech, Modi drew a comparison between the Covid situation in the state with that in some countries. “Take four European countries England, France, Italy and Spain. These countries have been super powers for 200-250 years. They are in a dominating position even now. These countries also have a total population of 24 crore. But 130,000 persons have died due to Covid there while only 600 persons have lost their lives in Uttar Pradesh… USA, too, is badly affected. USA has a population of 33 crore but 125,000 lives have been lost there. If UP had not prepared well it would have lost 85,000 lives… so by now Yogi government has saved lives of 85,000 persons.”He praised Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath for their handling of the crisis. “Can you imagine, his father died and instead of attending his father’s cremation he continued to work to protect you. I felicitate him,” Modi said, referring to the death of Adityanath’s father in April. “When other states are struggling to fight against Covid, Uttar Pradesh has launched such a big scheme for its development. The UP government is making use of every opportunity being created out of the crisis….We could not have imagined this achievement in situations that prevailed in UP before 2017,” the prime minister said, referring to the Bharatiya Janata Party coming to power in the state in the assembly elections three years ago. In his speech, Modi referred to the stampede at the Kumbh Mela in 1954, when roughly 500 people died, and indirectly criticised then prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. “Thousands of lives were lost in Kumbh when an MP from Allahabad was Prime Minister. Those in government then tried their best to hide the number of deaths,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mask-is-medicine-until-a-vaccine-is-found-says-pm/story-cv8lPOeMYC9rucgReRgqfL.html
27-06-2020||India||2 of 3 ‘doctors’ in rural India have no formal medical degrees: Study||At least two of every three “doctors” in rural India are informal providers of care, with no qualifications in modern system of medicine, according to India’s first comprehensive assessment of public and private health care availability and quality, as measured by their medical knowledge.Although 75% of villages have at least one health care provider and a village on average has three primary health providers, 86% of them are private “doctors” and 68% have no formal medical training, found a survey of 1,519 villages across 19 states in 2009 by researchers from the Centre for Policy Research (CPR) in New Delhi. The study has been published in the Social Science and Medicine journal.The study supports the World Health Organization’s 2016 report on ‘The Health Workforce in India’, which had also found that 57.3% people practising allopathic medicine in India did not have a medical qualification, and 31.4% were educated only up to secondary school level. Also read: Sharpest single day spike of over 5k Covid cases takes Maharashtra past 1.5 lakh markThe CPR study found that formal qualifications were not a predictor of quality, with the medical knowledge of informal providers in Tamil Nadu and Karnataka being higher than that of trained doctors in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, the study found.“For the vast majority of rural households, informal providers--usually called quacks-- are the only option that is locally available. Public health clinics and/or MBBS doctors are so few and far between that they are just not an option for most villagers. I knew that this was true of places that I had worked in (Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal), but had not realised that this generalised to almost every state, except Kerala. So the idea in health policy circles that as states get richer, informal providers will automatically vanish, is just not true in the data,” said lead author Jishnu Das, professor at the McCourt School of Public Policy and the Walsh School of Foreign Service at Georgetown University in Washington, on email.The share of informal providers did not decline with rising socioeconomic status, though the quality of doctors improved. “If informal providers are counted as primary care providers, there is really no “shortage” of human resources.. Any strategy that does not account for the fact that most of our primary care is delivered by these providers cannot work at this moment,” said Das, who led the study called, ‘Two Indias: The structure of primary health care markets in rural Indian villages with implications for policy’.The study found no correlation between the average local availability of healthcare providers and state health indicators, such as child mortality, which indicates that though people in villages can choose among multiple providers, they still do not get quality health care.The massive variation in medical knowledge was closely tied to training, the study found. “The variation across states in the quality of an MBBS degree is huge, with southern states doing much better than those in the north. Because informal providers typically spend a few years with a formal doctor, either as a compounder or in some attendant function, their knowledge also depends on who they worked with. So, the quality of informal providers and MBBS doctors moves together,” said Das.The paper estimated informal providers account for 68% of the total provider population in rural India, with 24% of them being Ayush doctors practising traditional and alternative stems of medicine and only 8% having an MBBS degree.“The Covid-19 crisis has placed unprecedented demands on our health care, making it clear that we need to have an urgent discussion on how it needs to be structured moving forward. This crucial paper uncovers fundamental features of our rural health care system with key insights for regulation, training and capacity,” said Yamini Aiyar, president and chief Executive, CPR. India is divided into two nations not just by quality of health care providers, but also by costs, with better performing states provide higher quality at lower per-visit costs. This trend was consistent with significant variation in the availability and quality of medical education across state.Not much has changed since 2009, according to professor Das . “In all likelihood, the availability and type of human resources has not changed since 2009. We base this on smaller surveys that have been carried out in several states in more recent years, which show a similar dominance of unqualified providers in the private sector,” he said.What has certainly changed is the cost of private healthcare. “Training community health officers to provide free primary health care with tele-medicine support at health & wellness centres under Ayushman Bharat is a way out, but for similar training of informal providers in the private sector to work, we need safeguards to ensure they don’t further misuse the training and put the health and lives of patients at risk,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-of-3-doctors-in-rural-india-have-no-formal-medical-degrees-study/story-sKywKL1HG8aBQZTpKLShmK.html

27-06-2020||India||‘We need to improve monitoring at home’: Randeep Guleria||On a day India crossed 500,000 cases, Dr Randeep Guleria, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi speaks about how early lockdown helped, what could have been done to help migrants and what lessons can be learnt from other countries. Excerpts: When will the pandemic peak? My own feeling is it that will peak at different times in different areas of the country, as we have seen in the US. It will probably start peaking in the next few weeks in places like Mumbai and Delhi, but in other areas, it may take a little longer for the infections to stabilise. Herd immunity will take a longer period of time. Rural India has the advantage of good social distancing, and in such areas, the cases will not rise dramatically and the numbers will come down. In the so-called hot spots with high population density, when (infections in) those areas get saturated, we will see the numbers coming down. In the so-called walled city in Delhi and urban slums like Dharavi in Mumbai, for example, this phenomenon is already being seen and numbers have started coming down. That is where the aggressive containment strategy comes into play, which includes testing, tracing and isolation.What did we get right? We implemented the lockdown early and that helped a lot. We were able to prevent a sudden massive increase in cases, as it happened in Europe. We had a gradual rise post lockdown, which gave us about two months to prepare our facilities. For example, from 10,000 tests day, we have crossed cross 200,000 tests a day now, from 100 labs, we now have 1,000 labs testing for Covid. Similarly, from a few isolation wards in select hospitals, we now have Covid hospitals, Covid care centres, dedicated ICUs, ventilators, oxygen, personal protection equipment, procured medicines... protocols are in place, doctors have been trained. All the systems could be put in place for pandemic preparedness.What could we have done better? The involvement of communities, social leaders and others for promoting the use of non-pharmacological methods, such as social distancing or wearing masks, for greater public participation in protecting themselves and helping contain infection. It’s unfortunate that despite such a large number of cases, people are still not realising their responsibility in terms of wearing a mask and maintaining social distancing. We could have better anticipated the movement of migrants and prepared a strategy to support them when they were in the city. This is also where social and community support comes in. What do we need to do better?We need an improved mechanism of monitoring people at home and rapidly shifting those who are ill from their homes to the hospital, and making sure hospital beds are available so that people don’t have to run from one hospital to another.Also, there’s need for aggressive testing, tracing and isolation to prevent an increase in the number of cases, house-to-house monitoring so people stay at home, and aggressive diagnostic testing and containment in hotspots so infection doesn’t spread to other areas. Why is it spiralling in some regions?After lockdown, we have not realised our responsibility in terms of taking measures to prevent the infection. People with mild illness go out and spread infection. Everyone who comes into close contact of a positive case must quarantine themselves even if you don’t feel ill as you may be pre-symptomatic or asymptomatic. If you don’t do that, you become part of the chain (that spreads infection). Cases are also spiralling in some regions because contact tracing was not done aggressively and people did not use protective measures enough, especially after lockdown was lifted.The graph that was stabilising in the US is now going straight up, they had 40,000 cases in a day, the highest single-day record. It is a classic example of people not realising their responsibility and whatever gains they had is lost. We need to see what is happening in other parts of the world and learn from that, rather than making the same mistakes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-need-to-improve-monitoring-at-home-randeep-guleria/story-N7ADiS1hbo6edBbLnUscOM.html
27-06-2020||India||Govt plans to double farm exports by ’22 to gain trade lead over China||New Delhi: In line with the “Atmanirbhar Bharat”, or self-reliant India, stance spelt out by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in recent weeks, India aims to double farm exports from US$ 30 billion now to US$ 60 billion by 2022, scout new markets hit by Covid-19, and put China at a disadvantage in bilateral farm trade, according to details of consultations to “recalibrate” the country’s agriculture trade policy set in 2018. An interministerial assessment last week showed there’s room to export more to the US, Canada, Chile, Ecuador, South Korea, Malaysia, Iran, and to China and its rival Taiwan, an official familiar with the developments said“Having invoked three Ordinances this month to liberalise the farm sector, it’s time to scout for new markets and boost exports. India is an agricultural powerhouse. Good export can help achieve doubling of farm incomes, a target set by the PM,” the official said.New export hubs for horticultural produce – fresh fruits and vegetables – will be opened in smaller cities as part of the strategy to provide direct global access to local farmers, according to the plan being discussed, he added. The country has got market access for 35 agricultural products with eight countries this month. It will send out a few more over the course of the next few months, according to the plan.India has a trade surplus with China when it comes to farm produce; in other words, the country sells more commodities, in value terms, to China than it buys from the neighbour. “The aims is to widen this gap to India’s advantage,” the official said. To be sure, as a rule, as economies become developed, they sell more and more high-value manufactured items rather than farm-based products. In 2018-19, India’s total agri-based exports to China, from raw cotton to shrimps, stood at US$ 1.9bn, a rise of 117% over the previous year. In the same year, India’s total agricultural imports from the neighbour was $282 million. India framed a national agriculture trade policy for the first time in 2018. Officials said this policy needs to be retuned because of the global impacts of the coronavirus pandemic. According to changes being proposed, while India aims to export more farm produce to China, it will cut down on some. Officials have identified 11 farm-based items which China imports from other trading partners, which India also has the potential to export.These items will be put in so-called “potential exports to China” category, including maize, tobacco, tamarind, broken rice, coffee, cashew and pre-cooked meals. Bihar is one of the largest producers of maize. On other hand, Indian imports from China included commodities in which India is self-sufficient, such as bamboo, wheat gluten and apple juice concentrate. “A centrally sponsored scheme is currently on to promote bamboo products because of large plantations in the Northeast. We will now promote exports of bamboo products, rather than importing them,” the official said. Marine products will receive special policy attention, the official added.The country has concluded discussions on phytosanitary certifications for Indian mangoes with Iran.Phytosanitary certification is a formal declaration by an exporting country guaranteeing that shipments are free of pests and plant diseases, and meet the requirement of the importing country.Taiwan will allow exports of Indian lily bulbs. Canada has cleared Indian mangoes, grapes, pomegranate, banana, litchi, papaya, custard apple and okra for export. Chile has approved coconut fibre and walnut. South Korea and Malaysia, too, have agreed to buy Indian mangoes. Equador is the latest country to clear Indian rice.To give local farmers access to exports, India conducted trial international shipments of farm produce directly from Varanasi and Guwahati before Covid-19 struck. The Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, in association with the farm ministry, identified 70 districts as potential export hubs. Shipments to Dubai from Varanasi contained chilli from Uttar Pradesh. Pineapples were sent from Guwahati and oranges from Meghalaya and Arunachal Pradesh. Smaller cities, like Varanasi and Guwahati, will now have complete infrastructure for exports, including phytosanitary certification.In a boost for mango exports, the US has agreed to shift pre-shipment inspection tasks to Indian plant quarantine authorities. The US has also agreed to bear the cost of these outbound inspections, which will bring down the cost of exports, a second official said. India is one the world’s largest growers of cereals, vegetables, fruits and the second largest grower of sugarcane. It is also the largest producer of milk. The government liberalised the farm economy through three ordinances announced on June 2. These aim to cut the government’s powers in deciding how much produce traders can store by amending the Essential Commodities Act, boost contract farming and remove rules requiring farmers to only sell their crops to licenced middlemen in state-notified markets. India’s agricultural exports grew five times from about $8.7 billion in 2004-05 to $42.6 billion during 2013-14. This fell to $33 billion in 2016-17. The country’s net exports (i.e. exports minus imports or the agricultural trade surplus) fell to $7.8 billion in 2016-17, falling a further 15 and 22 percentage points in 2017-18 and 2018-19. “Ramping up exports will call for a whole lot of infrastructure and relook of tariffs too. Also, our non-farm imports tariffs are around ASEAN levels, between 18-20%, but agricultural tariffs are still very high,” said Uma Kapila, an economist with the Academic Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-plans-to-double-farm-exports-by-22-to-gain-trade-lead-over-china/story-uyHq0hjOAgyikk0gqU2BhO.html
27-06-2020||India||Rahul Gandhi’s core team has moved out as calls for return grow||If Rahul Gandhi heeds the call of some of his party people and returns as Congress president, relieving his mother Sonia of the responsibility of leading the 135-year-old party, the first problem he will confront is on the human resources front.The people nurtured and mentored by the 50-year-old as part of his core team have either quit the party or their positions since he resigned as president in May 2019, owning responsibility for the Congress ‘s general election debacle. State unit chiefs such as Ashok Tanwar in Haryana, Pradyot Deb Barman in Tripura and Ajoy Kumar in Jharkhand, have all left the Congress Party.Ajay Maken who was appointed Delhi chief in 2015, quit before the 2019 polls.Senior leader Jyotiraditya Scindia switched to the Bhartiya Janata Party in March after a longstanding rift with former Madhya Pradesh colleagues, Kamal Nath and Digvijay Singh and the party central leadership’s hands-off approach to the crisis in Madhya Pradesh. And both of Rahul Gandhi’s appointees as Mumbai Congress chiefs, Sanjay Nirupam and Milind Deora, have stepped down from their posts. Rumours about them exiting the party refuse to die down, despite their own denials.So why did so many key team members leave in the 13 months since Rahul Gandhi called it quits?Nirupam answered with a question: ”Is it a coincidence that this is so or is there something of a bigger plan or strategy behind it?’’ The suggestion is that the team picked by Gandhi was sidelined by the old guard within the Congress party. In the ever-raging battle of the generations, his appointees stopped finding the support they needed to function in the party’s Delhi headquarters, one argument goes. “Those who are entrenched in the system help each other,’’ said Tanwar, who was picked as the Haryana Congress chief in 2019 and then quit the party in October last year ahead of the Haryana elections. “Rahul is a well-intentioned man who tried to build a new leadership and bring in new reforms and initiatives but once he left, there was no one who would listen to us.’’To be sure, none of those who left blame Gandhi “I think he is still the bravest and nicest guy to work for,’’ said former Indian Police Service (IPS) officer turned politician Ajoy Kumar, who quit as Jharkhand Congress head soon after Gandhi quit. He has now joined the Aam Aadmi Party. `After he resigned the protection needed to keep some not very nice people at bay disappeared. If he were there maybe they would not have succeeded in their designs.’’Pradyot Deb Barman ,who was the Congress’ Tripura chief, said he had quit because of it a total lack of direction. “There was no consistency in our policies. The old guard wasn’t supportive at all,’’ he said, adding, `”How could the Congress have a different view on the Citizenship Amendment Act in Assam and a different one in Tripura?’’ The Congress backed the NRC in Assam because of the original Assam accord but not in Tripura or other parts of the country.But there are others cosely associated with Gandhi who remain in the party -- for instance, the deputy chief minister of Rajasthan, Sachin Pilot , and new Rajya Sabha MP Rajeev Satav. Pilot, who declined comment for this story, has managed to build his own base within the party in Rajasthan. And Satav rejects the theory that Gandhi built an all-new, all young team. ``If you really look, you will find that Rahul Gandhi got along really well with Captain Amarinder Singh and with former Karnataka chief minister Siddaramaiah (neither of whom is really nxt-generation). So he pushed anyone who had the capacity to perform. He pushed 100 people and 10 may have left, but 90 are still there.’’Zoya Hasan, who taught at JNU and authored a book on the Congress says there is a larger problem with the party. “I can’t comment on who is leaving or not leaving. That’s been going on for a long time. The basic problem is that Congress doesn’t have a full time president for more than a year which should be unacceptable at any time but more so when the ruling party has a strong leader and the leading opposition party has none. It’s odd for a party to have an interim president (Sonia Gandhi) and defacto president (Rahul Gandhi) but no full time president. No political party can function without a full time president.“||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-s-core-team-has-moved-out-as-calls-for-return-grow/story-w3taJm706l6Fb4pAIEx9ZK.html
27-06-2020||India||PM Relief Fund money given to Rajiv foundation, says BJP||The Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF) donated money to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation (RGF) — a trust chaired by Congress president Sonia Gandhi — when the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power at the Centre, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) said on Friday, launching a fresh broadside against the opposition party in an ongoing war of words.In a series of tweets, BJP president JP Nadda said “one family’s hunger for wealth” hurt the nation, and also accused the Congress of committing a “brazen fraud” by diverting public money into a “family-run foundation”. His allegations came a day after the BJP said both the Chinese government and the Chinese embassy in India contributed to RGF.“PMNRF, meant to help people in distress, was donating money to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation in UPA years. Who sat on the PMNRF board? Smt. Sonia Gandhi. Who chairs RGF? Smt. Sonia Gandhi. Totally reprehensible, disregarding ethics, processes and not bothering about transparency,” Nadda tweeted.He also posted images of lists of donors to RGF for the years 2007-2008 and 2005-2006 to back his claim. The list included several state-owned companies, including the State Bank of India and GAIL, and ministries including the ministry of home affairs and the ministry of health. The Congress was quick to hit back after Nadda’s tweets, saying the BJP was playing a “diabolical game of deception” to divert attention from what it called “Chinese occupation” of Indian territory — a claim that came against the backdrop of a simmering dispute between India and China over the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).Twenty Indian Army soldiers and an undisclosed number of Chinese troops died in a brawl in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15, ratcheting up tensions between the neighbours amidst a military build-up on both sides of the disputed border. While the Congress accuses the government of ceding ground to the Chinese, the ruling BJP says the opposition party is playing with issues of national security.PMNRF was set up in 1948 by India’s first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, entirely with public contributions. It does not get any budgetary support. PMNRF resources are utilised primarily to give relief to families of those killed in natural calamities, and to victims of major accidents and riots, according to its website.“One family’s hunger for wealth has cost the nation immensely. If only they have devoted their energies towards more constructive agenda. The Congress’ Imperial Dynasty needs to apologise to the unchecked loot for self-gains!” Nadda tweeted, referring to the Nehru-Gandhi family.“People of India donated their hard-earned money to PMNRF to help their fellow citizens in need. To divert this public money into a family run foundation is not only a brazen fraud but also a big betrayal of the people of India,” he said in a third tweet.BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra, too, sought a response from Congress chief Sonia Gandhi, saying she was “no queen” and should explain the charges against her. Patra said PMNRF donated money to RGF three times when the Congress-led UPA was in power.Sonia Gandhi, as Congress chief, was on the board of PMNRF and also headed RGF, Patra said, alleging that she had “written the script of corruption in the country”.Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi, Priyanka Gandhi and P Chidambaram are trustees of RGF, which was set up in June 1991. The Congress said the BJP is trying to shift the focus from the Chinese issue. “The diabolical game of deception, diversion and disinformation is being played out by the BJP and JP Nadda to divert the attention of the country from the Chinese occupation of Galwan Valley, Pangong Tso and now Depsang up to the Y-junction, 18km inside the LAC,” Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said.In the statement, Surjewala pointed out that the BJP and the government “keep referring to a 2005 grant of ~1.45 crores received from Embassy of China to Rajiv Gandhi Foundation for the purpose (i) Disabled Persons Welfare Programme; and (ii) Research on Sino-India relationships”.He added that RGF accounts were duly audited and statutory returns were filed under the Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA) to the Indian government. “This grant has been duly reflected in all filings to the income tax and the Home Ministry and no authority has ever found any wrongdoing of any nature,” the statement added.“Pursuant to the unprecedented Tsunami in the last week of 2004, RGF received a modest amount of ~20 lakh from the Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund in the Financial Year 2005 which was duly utilised to undertake relief activities in the Andaman and Nicobar Islands,” it said.On Thursday, the BJP — led by Union law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad —alleged that RGF pushed for a free trade agreement between India and China, leading to a huge trade deficit skewed in favour of Beijing. Prasad said: “There is a pattern as to why the Congress party does not condemn China because the 10 years’ rule of the Manmohan Singh government is littered with various evidence as to how the Congress party tried to support China and make it earn tonnes of money by permitting the increase of trade deficit 33 times.”Nadda alleged that RGF accepted $300,000 from China and the Chinese embassy in 2005-06 for conducting studies that were not in national interest. “There is a secret understanding between the Congress and China.”In its response on Thursday, the Congress said the BJP was engaging in diversionary tactics, questioned it on visits and exchanges between the BJP and the Communist Party of China (CPC) over the past decade, and alleged that Prime Minister Narendra Modi shared a “strange bonhomie” with China even as the borders were insecure.Political scientist Neelanjan Sircar said: “Given the outsized importance and competitiveness of Chinese businesses in the Asian business environment, every politician and bureaucrat has needed to engage with them — regardless of the party. That does not mean that anyone, BJP or Congress, has given preferred access.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-relief-fund-money-given-to-rajiv-foundation-says-bjp/story-UbqWm4SpHxUsziSb7uAcUJ.html

We must put our best efforts to ensure all precautions are taken. Please complete all rituals on time; Strictly ensure that only those tested negative participate in the rituals and the chariot pulling; I and PR (Information and PR department) must ensure the live telecast of Bahuda Yatra, Sunabesha, Adhar Pana and the Niladri Bije,” Patnaik said during a video conference with officials including those of Jagannath temple administration.Thanking the temple servitors, Sri Jagannath temple administration, police and district administration Patnaik said that the Rath Yatra was organised very well.The chief minister’s advice came at a time when the district administration and the Sri Jagannath temple administration have started testing each and every servitor involved in temple rituals apart from those who pulled the chariots on June 23, the day of Rath yatra.As per Supreme Court’s order, around 1,400 sevayats of the temple had pulled the three chariots from the main temple to Gundicha temple over a distance of 2.5 km. The idols will be taken back to the 12th century Jagannath temple in the same chariots on July 1.Puri district collector Balwant Singh said by the time the chariots are pulled back to the main temple, at least 8,000 persons involved with Rath Yatra would have been tested for Covid-19, some of them twice. “For a population of 2.5 lakh in Puri town, the number of tests that are being conducted is very high, around 32,000 per million population,” he said.“While close to 900 servitors were tested before the Snana Purnima festival on June 5, we got 1100 more servitors tested a day before Rath Yatra started to comply with the SC guidelines of only allowing those with Covid-19 negative reports to be involved in the festival. After June 23, we plan to test 6,000 more including policemen, all temple servitors, temple officials, sanitary staff and even electricity workers. We are re-testing the servitors who earlier tested negative and are staying in quarantine,” said Singh.The servitors who take part in Rath yatra do not normally step out or eat food outside. “This time we are taking additional precautions and had a discussion with Chhatisa Nijog, the apex body of the temple priests,” the collector said.During the Covid-19 test of the temple servitors on June 22, a 20-year-old servitor had tested positive. However, 40 of his primary contacts including 14 of his family members all tested negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-only-covid-19-negative-participate-in-bahuda-yatra-on-july-1-odisha-cm/story-4RKjRKhba4kL75n7EMtLMN.html

States make their choice as Covid tide continues to rise||As coronavirus cases in India are showing record spikes with each passing day and cases in most states are also demonstrating a rising trend, administrations are faced with the dilemma of either opening up activities further with the advent of second phase of Unlock beginning July 1 or of resorting to varying degrees of lockdown in an attempt to arrest the tide of cases. Some states like West Bengal and Jharkhand have decided to extend the lockdown till July 31, while others like Tamil Nadu have decided to selectively lockdown a few worst-affected districts.We bring you a sense of the mood in some states where a decision on the future course of action is being takenJharkhand- The state government has extended lockdown till July 31. However, a detailed order explaining what it entails is not available yet and the degrees of restrictions that will be placed in the state with 2,262 positive cases as on Thursday will be known soon.

27-06-2020||India||China, the common link between Ladakh and 3 US super carriers in the Indo-Pacific||Chinese military power and strategic attention is overwhelmingly directed towards the Pacific Ocean. Which is why Beijing’s military planners are presently dividing their attention between troop face-offs in Ladakh and three US aircraft carrier groups in the Pacific Ocean. The last time there were so many US super-carriers in the Pacific was three years ago because of North Korea. The US Indo-Pacific Command last month said all its forward-deployed submarines were at sea.The US naval deployment, while not originally motivated by events along the Sino-Indian border, has inevitably become part of China’s larger strategic calculus. Explains Vice-Admiral Anil Chopra, who just completed a term as the maritime expert on the National Security Advisory Board: The “movement of naval forces escalates things. Whenever you move them into an area of confrontation, it serves to send a message. The Chinese will worry about what the carriers can do, not what they necessarily will do.” Chopra says, “It has to be taken into account. That’s the main point of a carrier, it injects a degree of uncertainty.”While one carrier is off the US Pacific coast and another is near the Philippines, the USS Theodore Roosevelt has moved southwards to Vietnam. This location, says Mohan Malik, professor of strategic studies at the Pentagon’s Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, means that “in the event of a war, this carrier group would probably move to the Malacca Straits and the Bay of Bengal”.Also Read: China’s aggressive posturing turning relationship with India back to 1990sThe USS Roosevelt is a super-carrier, three times the size of an Indian or Chinese carrier, and its battle group would include accompanying cruisers, destroyer squadrons and submarines. “The US could deter the outbreak of a two-front war involving China and Pakistan on one side and India on other by dispatching an aircraft carrier battle group to the eastern Indian Ocean,” says Malik – if events were to spiral out of control. The unusual carrier deployment is a remarkable consequence of the Covid-19 epidemic.In March, viral outbreaks infected three US carrier crews. At one point , only one functional US carrier was left in both the Indian and Pacific Oceans. China began increasing naval and air force incursions into Taiwan’s airspace and tightening its grip on Hong Kong. The official WeChat account of Eastern Theatre Command of the People’s Liberation Army posted articles in mid-April calling for China to prepare for war.A Chinese scholar on the US, Wang Jisi, warned on a webinar the same month that hawks in China saw opportunities in the “US preoccupation in the election year and over the pandemic.”Concerned China might consider an attack on Taiwan, Washington ordered all three of its active super-carriers, now virus free, and at least eight nuclear submarines into the Pacific. Beijing warned Washington to “stop moving chess pieces around” the region and “flexing its military muscles around China.”This underlines the degree to which the US deploys its military with an almost single-minded determination to contain China. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday explained US troops withdrawing from Europe were being moved to tackle the threat China posed to countries such as India. His is the latest in a series of senior US official statements derived from the 2018 National Defence Strategy’s broad recommendation that US military power be directed primarily at China. US officials have privately told their Indian counterparts that one reason for their desire to leave Afghanistan is to divert the $ 50 billion-a-year US spends there to take on China.US Pentagon chief Mark Esper in February spoke of converting the 2018 strategy into a “new war plan” that would be completed this summer. The plan would integrate the assets of the four US military services in the Indo-Pacific. As Esper explained to Defence News: “A drone sees an enemy target, relays it to an airplane, an F-35, which relays it to a Navy ship, which either shoots it or relays it back to a Marine Corps long-range precision fire that’s island-based.” Esper called this a “big pivot point for us,” possibly recalling the original and militarily feeble “pivot to Asia” of the Obama administration.The US military’s biggest concern is its “missile gap” against China. The US was banned from testing or deploying intermediate-range missiles (500 to 5,500 km range) globally because of a Soviet-era arms control treaty. Exploiting this lacuna, China has deployed over 2,000 long-range missiles along its shore. The US has war gamed that, if forced to fight close to the Chinese shore, its military would be defeated. The Trump administration pulled out of the missile treaty last year and begun the rapid deployment of similar missiles along the Pacific. But Beijing knows it is secure against even a limited military engagement near the mainland for the next few years.It is likely that this has emboldened China and contributes to the recent aggression it has shown to a variety of countries, the most recent being India.“In the Cold War between China and America, India has emerged as a front-line state. China’s military pressure all along the disputed boundary is clearly aimed at the Finlandization of India. Beijing wants to deny India a peaceful environment essential to realizing its economic developmental goals that would narrow the power gap with China,” says Malik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-covid-19-and-us-aircraft-carriers-unbalanced-the-indo-pacific/story-dFhXsyDrYnibMIFmhMQ3WP.html
27-06-2020||India||Cooking to gym training, urban migrants did it all||Teachers, mechanics, cooks, electricians and gym instructors — migrant workers from myriad occupations -- have returned home in the past couple of months, skill mapping in different states has revealed, indicating how the pandemic has affected livelihood across professions and across regions.The skill mapping was conducted to roll out the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan, the targeted programme for jobs to migrant workers in 116 districts that have received at least 25,000 migrant workers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the programme from Bihar on June 20 via video conference.According to the union government’s initial estimate, about 7.5 million migrant workers have returned to their states of origin by buses and trains, but officials pointed out that the skill mapping exercise is on at a time when several migrant workers have returned through other means, and some are still on their way back to villages.The government’s initial estimate shows that different states have mapped a wide range of skills. UP has mapped its 3.4 million workers across 80 skill areas, while Jharkhand has classified its returnees in four broad areas based on their interest in livelihood. Officials added that more than 60% of the migrant workers belonged to construction industry in various capacities and the government hopes they can be effectively engaged in construction of roads, houses and other structures in the rural areas.“We have seen a wide range of professions among the returnee migrant workers. While about 30% or the largest group of migrants consists of unskilled workers in the construction areas, there are people from industries such as textiles, automobile, electricians, carpenters and agricultural workers who have returned,” said an official.Mechanics and carpenters comprise of about 10% of the returnees, and a large number of students have also returned to their home states, he added. “Some states have even identified at the micro-level and found out gym instructors, banking agents, mechanics, tailors and others who have returned,” said the same official.Also read | Social distancing goes for a toss at Delhi’s RML testing centreSo far, among the key districts, UP’s Siddharth Nagar and Prayagraj have received 160,000 and 104,000 migrant labourers, while Madhya Pradesh’s Balaghat has 102,000 returnees.Rajasthan’s Udaipur has seen 127,000 migrant labourers returning and Pali district received another 140,000 lakh daily wagers. Bihar has eight districts with more than 100,000 returnees; and Odisha’s highest number of migrant workers --125,000 -- have returned to Ganjam.The Union skill development ministry, along with the rural development ministry, is in touch with the states to get regular updates on the return of migrant workers, officials said.The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan is confined to India’s 116 districts across Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha, but some other states also want their districts to be included. “Several states including West Bengal, Assam, Chhattisgarh are putting pressure on us to include some of their districts in this programme,” said a senior official of the rural development ministry, “but we don’t have any immediate plan to expand this list.”Also read | At Delhi’s shelter homes, inmates complain of no medicine while doctors battle multiple threatsThe skill ministry is also coordinating with the states with an objective to train 150,000 migrant workers under Short Term Training (STT) and another 150,000 in Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL).“The Centre has tried to resolve the migrant crisis in two ways-- by providing food grains and jobs. Although many workers look back at the opportunity to return to the cities to earn more, the Centre’s welfare package might have to continue for long. The government may also consider incentives for companies that take back migrant workers,” said Achiranshu Acharya, economist with Viswabharati university.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cooking-to-gym-training-urban-migrants-did-it-all/story-fmnothYhndGUahKJo0BvAN.html
