Now, teachers will do the same. Those who are responsible for shaping the future of students have been assigned with the job of selling liquor. There is no shame left in the state government,” he said.However, the order was later cancelled by the district administration. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesEarlier, Congress had attacked the government over a photo that went viral on social media on Wednesday, showing a woman cop sitting in a liquor shop.The incident follows the state government’s decision to run about 70% liquor shops across the state on its own from Tuesday after contractors surrendered their licences as per an option given by the high court during an ongoing legal battle between the two sides. The contractors are demanding reduction in licence fee in view of the losses incurred due to the closure of shops.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19However, an understaffed excise department has sought assistance from other departments to run these shops. Collector of Sagar district Deepak Singh said the order was only meant to tide over a temporary problem.“The order was just for a day when there was some initial problem. But none of the employees engaged in the duty are in teaching staff and perhaps none of them visited the liquor shops as well. The said order, too, has been cancelled now.”State BJP spokesperson Rahul Kothari said, “Congress is trying to create confusion among people by misleading them. No teacher was engaged in the sale of liquor and police personnel are supposed to ensure security in the area. None are engaged in the sale of liquor. Congress should apologise to people for telling lies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-slams-mp-govt-for-engaging-teachers-in-liquor-sale-order-cancelled/story-PI3nh9A2NjiS80efU1nfNK.html
12-06-2020||India||Make Covid warriors feel safe: SC||New DelhiUnpaid salaries to doctors and lack of quarantine facilities for heathcare workers engaged in fighting COVID-19 led an anguished Supreme Court on Friday to remark that in a war-like situation, the Centre should travel the extra mile to ensure that the corona warriors are kept safe and happy.The Court was dealing with a petition by a doctor, Arushi Jain who complained of inadequate quarantine facilities across the country. Representing the petitioner, senior advocate KV Vishwanathan informed the Court that as per May 15, 2020 Guidelines issued by the Health Ministry titled “Advisory for Managing Healthcare Workers working in COVID and non-COVID Areas of the Hospital”, only high-risk health care workers or those showing symptoms of COVID-19 need 14-day quarantine. He wondered how such a distinction could be made.The bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah said, “This is a kind of war (against Coronavirus pandemic). You cannot keep soldiers unhappy during a war. Travel the extra mile to make the corona warriors (doctors, nurses, medical staff) feel safe.”Vishwanathan also informed the Court that some doctors working at government and private hospitals have not been paid salaries in full. Noting these facts with concern, the bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who attended the virtual court hearing through videoconferencing, “These issues should not engage our attention. It should be settled by you (Government). ”Mehta submitted that the concerns expressed by the petitioner seem to be ad-hoc, but added that the petitioner could frame a representation highlighting the problems, and that these would be addressed by the government. The bench allowed the petitioner to file a representation highlighting these concerns and make suggestions to the Union Health Secretary. The Centre was directed to consider the same and file a report by Wednesday, the next date of hearing.Earlier, in response to the petition, the Centre filed an affidavit claiming that protecting health care workers was the government’s top-most priority because it expects a surge in the number of coronavirus infections in the coming days. “At some point of time in near future, apart from existing hospitals, large number of temporary makeshift hospitals will have to be created.” It also categorised health care workers as low-risk and high-risk in terms of their potential exposure to the virus. In response to the Centre’s affidavit, the petitioner filed a reply stating that all healthcare workers serving in Covid centres and hospitals, by default, are in the high-risk category due to the infectious nature of this disease. The petitioner requested the Court to add states as parties to the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/make-covid-warriors-feel-safe-sc/story-JXsxvv35MmNfSF6gC4S9OI.html

We stand committed for reservation and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly said this,” BJP president JP Nadda said, adding that his party was working to ensure social harmony.Meanwhile, Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan, the leader of National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partner Lok Janshakti Party, demanded that all parties should come together and put all laws related to quota in the ninth schedule of the Constitution, which will preclude any legal challenge.Paswan said reservation, which provides scheduled castes, scheduled tribes, other backward classes (OBCs) and economically backward members of general castes quota in government jobs and educational institutions, may not be a fundamental right but is very much a constitutional right.The Supreme Court refused on Thursday to entertain pleas of various parties challenging the Centre’s decision not to grant 50% reservation to OBCs as per a Tamil Nadu law in medical seats surrendered by the state in the all India quota for undergraduate, postgraduate and dental courses in 2020-21, saying the right to reservation is not a fundamental right.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-committed-to-giving-quota-to-the-weak-says-nadda/story-YqQTsjbWcZ8itDxkq7EytI.html

12-06-2020||India||Military officers hold fifth round of India-China talks||NEW DELHIArmy delegations from India and China, led by major general-ranked officers, on Friday held discussions in eastern Ladakh again to resolve the standoff between border troops as defence minister Rajnath Singh met the military brass here and reviewed the situation along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC), two officers said on condition of anonymity.This was the fifth meeting between the two major generals to break the stalemate that began with a violent confrontation between rival patrols near Pangong Tso on the night of May 5-6.The two officers last met at Patrolling Point 14 near the Galwan area on Wednesday as part of continuing efforts to resolve the confrontation that eased slightly with limited disengagement of forces at some LAC hotspots earlier this week.Friday’s meeting between major general Abhijit Bapat, commander of the Karu-based HQs 3 Infantry Division, and his Chinese counterpart went on for nearly five hours, said one of the officers cited above.In Delhi, the defence minister was briefed on the ongoing border scrap and the status of the military-level dialogue to resolve it at a meeting with chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and the service chiefs, said the second officer cited above.Earlier this week, the two sides began what Indian officials described as a “limited military disengagement” at three hotspots along the LAC – Galwan Valley, Patrolling Point 15 and Hot Springs.The limited disengagement happened after a meeting between Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the People’s Liberation Army, in the South Xinjiang region last Saturday.The focus is now on resolving the situation on the northern bank of Pangong Tso, which has been at the centre of the ongoing border scrap and where troops are still locked in a face-off.Last month’s violent confrontations between Indian and Chinese soldiers in eastern Ladakh and north Sikkim triggered a military build-up on both sides of the LAC that stretched from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh, as reported by Hindustan Times on Friday.The Chinese build-up began immediately after clashes between border troops in Ladakh and Sikkim on May 5-6 and May 9, and predated the June 6 meeting between Lieutenant General Singh and his Chinese counterpart at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC.India and China are continuing diplomatic and military engagements for an “early resolution” of the stand-off between border troops, the external affairs ministry said on Thursday. More military talks are planned in the coming days to ease border tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-officers-hold-fifth-round-of-india-china-talks/story-0cMogRjZ98vkhz3sYkhpnO.html

Almost all silk in India is produced in just five states of Karnataka, Andhra, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal and J&K. Karnataka produces 70 per cent of the total mulberry silk produced in the country.K C Narayana Gowda, the minister for municipal administration, horticulture and sericulture in the government of Karnataka said a letter had been written to the centre with the above-mentioned requests.Gowda had earlier met with a delegation of sericulturists who complained that they have been affected by the alleged dumping of silk by China. The delegation also appealed to the government to impose additional anti-dumping duty on China as well as ban imports from that country to protect domestic sericulturaists.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesGowda assured them that he would discuss the matter with the chief minister and expressed confidence that the Centre would take all necessary steps to protect the interests of the Indian silk industry.Karnataka government’s move comes amid calls to boycott Chinese products in the wake of a tense border standoff with Beijing and also efforts to attract companies that may consider relocating from China in the post-corona world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-requests-centre-to-ban-import-of-chinese-silk-to-protect-domestic-players/story-PKWYq96FFR4JVD2eSzQGIM.html

OIL has contacted North East Institute of Science and Technology (NEIST) to carry out a study to see if there is any induced seismicity due to the blowout,” said an OIL release.Nearly three dozen houses near the well have been razed because of fire. Though its spread has now been contained to the well, the initial flare burned down trees and also impacted the Maguri Motapung wetland, an important bird breeding site.“We started experiencing tremors from Wednesday, a day after the well caught fire. That night the tremors lasted for nearly 10-12 hours and walls of several houses got cracked,” said Hiren Senapati, the president of eco-development committee of Natun Rongagora.“The tremors have been happening intermittently now. Nearly 80% of our villagers are staying in relief camps, the rest who were in their homes are scared to live there because of the tremors...,” said Senapati.According to villagers, the local administration visited Natun Rongagora and took stock of the damage. “It is possible that some tremors had happened in the area close to the well, which witnessed a blowout and subsequently caught fire...“We are in constant touch with OIL authorities. We will be sending out seismology team and equipment to try to evaluate the situation on the ground. From a scientific point of view, we are very keen to look at what are these tremors and analyse its impact,” said G Narahari Sastry, director, NEIST.Meanwhile, efforts were underway to control the fire at the well and plug the blowout. Equipment needed for the purpose have been mobilised, a water reservoir has been dug, and the testing of pumps, engines and auxiliary equipment is under progress, said a release by OIL.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tremors-felt-near-assam-gas-blowout-site/story-wora56ST1f8rAxrBH7oA7J.html

Speaking to reporters, the minister for medical education Dr K Sudhakar claimed that there may be a surge in the state around mid-August. “About 97 per cent of the 3,000 cases in the state are asymptomatic. Experts have said that there may be a surge around mid-August and the state is taking all necessary precautionary measures in this regard. We might convert large stadiums into quarantine centres.”The minister claimed that the performance of the government has been good till now in combating the spread of Covid-19 pointing out that while nearly 60% of the total Covid-19 cases are found in 10 cities and despite Bangalore being the 4th most populous, it has managed to successfully contain the spread of the virus.A senior health department official though said that the state government was examining the Delhi model of providing treatment and quarantine at home for asymptomatic patients who are not suffering from any other serious health issues. “While right now we can still handle any surge in cases, going forward we might have to increasingly prioritize and the way to go ahead is the Delhi model of providing a ‘home care package’. Those who have facilities at home and can be isolated there itself, should do so,” said the official who did not want to be named.The state government has already started to identify large facilities like palace grounds, Kanteerava stadium, Bangalore International Exhibition Centre grounds as well as others where temporary hospitals can be created if required at short notice. “We hope that the situation will not come to that but we are gearing up to face any eventuality,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-may-adopt-delhi-model-of-treatment-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-surge/story-CpdrCTtqk9b8jxfqpZv9bN.html

The Government of India led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Bhartiya Janata Party are committed to providing reservation. Our commitment to social justice is unshakeable. We stand committed for reservation and Prime Minister Narendra Modi has repeatedly said this,” said Nadda.The BJP chief said his party constantly worked for social harmony and ensuring equal opportunities.Nadda’s comments came in the wake of a Supreme Court order where it said that the right to reservation was not a fundamental right.However, the BJP, keen not to let political opponents use it to dub the party anti-reservation, immediately came out to make its stand clear. Significantly, in the 2015 Bihar Assembly elections, the opposition parties had attacked the BJP, accusing it of being anti-reservation.Also Read: PM Modi to meet chief ministers on June 16, 17 amid spike in Covid-19 casesMeanwhile, the leader of key NDA ally LJP and Union food minister Ram Vilas Paswan demanded that all parties come together to put all laws related to quota in the ninth schedule of the Constitution, which will preclude any legal challenge to it.Paswan said reservation, which provides scheduled castes and tribes, other backward classes and economically backward members of general castes quota in government jobs and educational institutions, may not be a fundamental right but is very much a constitutional right.Expressing disappointment that controversies often kept arising on the issue, Paswan said reservation for the scheduled castes and tribes owes its genesis to the Poona pact between Mahatma Gandhi and B R Ambedkar.“The LJP appeals to all political parties, who have joined hands over the issue earlier as well, that they should come together to put all laws regarding reservation in the Constitution’s ninth schedule to lay all controversies to rest,” he said in a statement.The Supreme Court Thursday refused to entertain pleas of various political parties challenging the Centre’s decision not to grant 50 per cent reservation to OBCs as per Tamil Nadu law in medical seats surrendered by the state in the all India quota for undergraduate, postgraduate and dental courses in 2020-21, saying the right to reservation is not a fundamental right.Also Read: ‘Up to state govt to decide’: Supreme Court allows Tamil Nadu to sell liquorThe top court asked the political parties, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK), CPI(M), MDMK of Vaiko, PMK of Anubmani Ramadoss, Tamil Nadu Congress Committee and CPI, to approach the Madras High Court with their pleas for grant of OBC quota in medical admissions.The court had, however, appreciated their concern for the welfare of the backward castes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-and-centre-committed-to-providing-reservation-nadda/story-5BFfOjWhNKdXWb7WdXJhxK.html

At least, 17,261 Covid-19 positive patients are confined to home isolation in the city. The current doubling rate of the coronavirus infection in the national capital is 14 days, so Delhi is likely to see over 56,000 cases by the end of the next two weeks, the Delhi health ministry has predicted.Except for June 1, when Delhi saw a spike of 990 cases, it has been recording over 1,000 fresh Covid-19 cases every day from May 28 to June 10, the highest being 2,137 new Covid-19 cases detected in the last 24 hours.ALSO READ | India’s coronavirus count crosses 3 lakh mark but doubling rate improvesOn Friday, the Delhi High Court imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 on a petitioner who had challenged the Centre’s decision to relax the nationwide lockdown from June 1, saying that the decision of re-opening had been ordered in a phased manner and was not one that appeared to have been taken in haste.The petition had sought imposition of a lockdown on grounds that during the earlier lockdown period, the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases was low.

12-06-2020||India||Trump considers suspending H-1B, L-1 and other work visas, could hit Indians hard||The Trump administration is considering suspending several categories of employment-based visas including H-1B for high-skilled foreigners and L-1 for internal company transfers, both very popular with Indian companies with US operations and Indians seeking to work in America.The Wall Street Journal, which first reported this move, said President Donald Trump has not signed off on the proposal, which is part of a package of changes to other work-related visas and authorizations for foreigners yet, and things could change. An executive order is expected in some weeks.The plan also includes ending Obama-era work authorization for spouses of H-1B visa holders cleared for Green Cards, which would impact mostly Indians. The Green Card waiting line is the longest for Indians because of a country-limit of 7% on the number of Green Cards — around 1 million annually — that can be issued to people from any one country.Charges for H-1Bs could also be increased substantially to $20,000 from current $460, as processing fee or some kind of a surcharge.The package seeks, additionally, to end or scale back work authorisation for foreign students, called Optional Practical Training.The move stems from the administration’s efforts to boost employment in the country, which has experienced record job losses caused by the Covid-19 lockdown. The aim is to ensure Americans have the first crack at jobs that become available as the economy rebounds.Also Read: Seattle mayor tells Donald Trump to ‘go back to your bunker’The suspension will extend into the new fiscal year that starts on October 1 and will likely impact new H-1B workers who typically apply then.The White House did not deny the move and a spokesman told the WSJ in a statement, “The administration is currently evaluating a wide range of options, formulated by career experts, to protect American workers and job seekers, especially disadvantaged and underserved citizens—but no decisions of any kind have been made.”President Donald Trump has already suspended all immigration in view of the Covid-19 epidemic, including Green Cards. Non-immigrant work visas were spared, but not any longer if this the package of changes being considered goes through.The United States issues 85,000 H-1B visas every year; 65,000 to foreign workers hired from abroad and 20,000 to foreigners enrolled in US institutions of advanced learning. More than 70% of these visas tend to go to Indians either hired by American companies such as Google, Apple and Microsoft or Indian companies with US operations such as TCS, Infosys and Wipro.Watch: Donald Trump warns against ‘falsely labelling’ decent Americans as racistsThis distinction between those hired abroad and here in the United States has blurred lately as the administration has chosen to hire more foreign students even in the open category to address criticism that the short term visa is being misused to bring foreign workers who are not really high skilled but are cheaper alternatives to Americans. For the same reason, the H-1B visa rejections and request for more paperwork have gone up.L-1 visas for intracompany transfers, which have also been very popular with Indian companies who send executives from India to staff positions for their US operations, have also seen more scrutiny and curbs over a period of time.The tightening of rules for both H-1B and L-1 has routinely been brought up by Indian officials with their US counterparts, but without much success. And now this.The plan has been in the works for some months now and it is expected to be presented to the president for his approval soon.Healthcare professionals and workers are expected to be exempted from the suspension. The move is facing opposition from several quarters, including colleges and universities, the WSJ reported.Some Republican lawmakers have also cautioned against a hasty decision on the matter.“American businesses that rely on help from these visa programs should not be forced to close without serious consideration,” nine Republican senators including Lindsey Graham and John Cornyn wrote in a letter to the president in May. “Guest workers are needed to boost American business, not take American jobs,” the letter added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-considers-suspending-h-1b-l-1-and-other-work-visas-could-hit-indians-hard/story-Z7sYkCphk4IHYs9mUzVExN.html

12-06-2020||India||Deve Gowda, 87, back in Rajya Sabha for the first time since 1996||Former Prime Minister Deve Gowda, former leader of Congress in Lok Sabha Mallikarjuna Kharge as well as two BJP candidates - Eranna Kadadi and Ashok Gasti - were elected unopposed to the Rajya Sabha on Friday.Four Rajya Sabha seats from Karnataka fell vacant this month after Rajeev Gowda and BK Hari Prasad of the Congress, Prabhakar Kore of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and D Kupendra Reddy of the JD(S) completed their term.While the BJP chose to send two grassroot workers to the Rajya Sabha, the Congress chose to send its senior leader Kharge, who had lost polls for the first time in 12 electoral outings from the Gulbarga Lok Sabha constituency to his BJP opponent Umesh Jadhav.The JD(S) leader and former Prime Minister Deve Gowda was also declared elected despite his party having 10 votes short for sending a member to the Upper House as the Congress chose to extend support to him while the BJP decided not to field a candidate against the veteran leader.Speaking to reporters after being elected, Mallikarjuna Kharge thanked Congress president Sonia Gandhi for reposing faith in him and said he would do his utmost to effectively highlight issues facing the state and the country in parliament.Responding to taunts by some BJP leaders that he has been forced to enter Parliament through backdoor, the 77-year-old Kharge retorted: “I have won 9 assembly polls on the trot as well as two consecutive Lok Sabha polls. Let them first get as much political experience as I have done and then they can comment.”Former PM Gowda had lost the Lok Sabha polls from Tumkur after he vacated his traditional Hassan seat in favour of his grandson Prajwal Revanna, who is the party’s sole representative in the Lok Sabha. This is 87-year-old Gowda’s second stint in the Rajya Sabha, the first being when he was the PM in 1996.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deve-gowda-87-back-in-rajya-sabha-for-the-first-time-since-1996/story-vGGxA1oHjZwFeT4mzy9kaM.html

A horrific tragedy, resulting from a lethal blend of arrogance and incompetence,” Gandhi said on Twitter.India is firmly on it's way to winning the wrong race. A horrific tragedy, resulting from a lethal blend of arrogance and incompetence. pic.twitter.com/NB2OzXPGCXRahul’s comments come at a time when India crossed 300,000 infections with more than 10,000 cases getting registered daily over the past few days. According to worldometers.com, India is currently the fourth worst-infected country, behind only the USA, Brazil and Russia.On June 6, Rahul Gandhi had questioned centre’s handling of the coronavirus crisis alleging that the lockdown imposed to contain the rise of Covid-19 infections and the subsequent phase-wise unlocking to revive economic activity in the country was ill-timed. He had posted graphs even then to back up his claim that some of the other worst-hit countries in the west had timed their lockdowns and its easing, much better than India.Rahul’s tweet comparing India with Spain, Germany, Italy and UK had drawn flak from the ruling party leaders.Rahul has consistently criticised the government’s response to the current coronavirus induced crisis. On May 26, he had asked the central government to explain the roadmap ahead while suggesting the lockdown had failed its purpose.Rahul’s statements on the issue of lockdown have drawn flak from the government in the past. Union minister Prakash Javadekar had cited data to claim that Rahul’s assessment of the situation was flawed. BJP President JP Nadda, too, had hit out at Rahul on May 30 and claimed that the Congress leader had a limited understanding of “these issues” and his statements were aimed at politicizing issues instead of addressing the crisis.Apart from coronavirus handling, Rahul has also questioned the government over the recent border standoff with China. His suggestion that China could have occupied Indian territory in Ladakh during the recent violent clashes along the LAC in the eastern sector was also rejected by the government. BJP’s MP from Ladakh Jamyang Tsering Namgyal too hit out at Gandhi and said that China had occupied Indian territory of Aksai Chin during the 1962 war and it happened when the Congress ruled at the centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/winning-the-wrong-race-rahul-gandhi-attacks-centre-s-covid-19-containment-strategy/story-SRl36HLrOtqfBDrwkD8EQI.html

Remdesivir, the investigational drug from Gilead Sciences Inc, has been issued an ‘emergency use authorisation’ (EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) to treat patients suffering from severe symptoms of coronavirus, Zydus Cadila said in a statement. Earlier, in May, three domestic pharmaceutical firms Cipla, Jubilant Life Sciences and Hetero entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with Gilead Sciences Inc for manufacturing and distribution of remdesivir. Zydus Chairman Pankaj Patel said, “We are happy to collaborate with Gilead Sciences and increase the access to this life-saving drug for patients suffering from Covid-19.” In the last decade, Zydus Cadila has been partnering with Gilead Sciences to address various public healthcare challenges and improve global access to affordable need-based therapies, he added. “At this critical juncture, we join hands once again to ensure that no efforts are spared in the fight against this pandemic,” Patel said. As part of the non-exclusive agreement, Zydus will receive the manufacturing know-how from Gilead Sciences Inc to manufacture the API for remdesivir and the finished product and market it in 127 countries, including India, the statement said. “Under the agreement, the licence is royalty free until another pharmaceutical product or vaccine is approved for the treatment or prevention of Covid-19 by the USFDA or EMA (European Medicines Agency) or the WHO (World Health Organization) announcing the end of the public health emergency,” it added. The company will leverage its ability to scale up production to reach patients across India and in 127 countries in Gilead’s global patient solution region, the statement said. In-vitro testing conducted by Gilead has demonstrated that remdesivir is active against the virus that causes Covid-19. The safety and efficacy of remdesivir to treat Covid-19 are being evaluated in multiple ongoing Phase-3 clinical trials, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-cadila-inks-licensing-pact-with-gilead-for-remdesivir/story-d0GL5xJwuRLvg2UxSbIr4M.html
12-06-2020||India||Kerala tweaks containment plan, uses reverse quarantine to fight Covid-19||The Kerala government, amid a spike in coronavirus cases in the state, has announced a targeted containment strategy and asked grassroots health workers to collect details of elderly people and those suffering from comorbidities to implement reverse quarantine.Under reverse quarantine, people having underlying medical conditions, especially those above 65 years and persons who are immune-compromised will be segregated from other family members. This will be implemented through family members and local bodies which are tasked with providing medicine, food, counselling and other assistance to those who are set to undergo this exercise for their safety.The government has revised the containment zone protocol for targeted implementation of anti-pandemic measures.Out of 20 deaths in the state due to coronavirus, 15 were those of above age 65 and suffering from many other health complications. The health department is planning to detach vulnerable people from the rest and monitor their health indicators to reduce the mortality rate.“We are planning a limited lockdown in a distributed manner based on the community pandemic level. In this case, we can target the affected areas specifically and take containment provisions accordingly. We will notify new containment zones every day,” said state health minister K K Shailaja on Friday, adding the district collectors can decide the extension of lockdown after the mandatory seven-day period.The minister also said from now on home quarantine will be room quarantine and officials will ensure this before a particular patient undergoes it.“We have reports that many in home quarantine are interacting with their family members as usual. This is one of the reasons for secondary infections,” she said, adding the health department will encourage reverse quarantine in a big way.After test rates went up (over 1,02000 now) cases have also increased in the state, the minister added.The government has also roped in private hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients and the details will soon be worked out. So far, only government hospitals were dealing with coronavirus patients in the state. It has also decided to continue full lockdown on all Sundays till the situation improves. Using reverse quarantine, it hopes to keep a check on the community spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-tweaks-containment-plan-uses-reverse-quarantine-to-fight-covid-19/story-JpbANhY4mZJ6D1h0s5HF8K.html
12-06-2020||India||Now, tremors rock villages near Assam’s gas well fire site||After the blowout and fire at Oil India Limited’s (OIL) natural gas well - which claimed lives of two firefighters on Tuesday - local residents in Assam’s Tinsukia district are now experiencing tremors that have resulted in cracks in several homes.Residents of Natun Rongagora village, located 2.5 km from the Baghjan well, which had a blowout on May 27 and caught fire on June 9, are worried their homes could suffer extensive damages if the tremors continue.Nearly three dozen houses near the well have been razed because of fire that has been raging since Tuesday. Though the extent of its spread has now been contained to the well, the initial flare burned down trees and also impacted Maguri Motapung wetland, an important bird breeding site.“We started experiencing tremors from Wednesday, a day after the well caught fire. That night the tremors lasted for nearly 10-12 hours and walls of several houses got cracked,” said Hiren Senapati, president of eco-development committee of Natun Rongagora.The Baghjan well had a blowout, uncontrolled release of gas and oil condensate, while operations were on to locate a new gas reservoir. Efforts are underway to plug the well, it caught fire on June 9.“The tremors have been happening intermittently now. Nearly 80% of our villagers are staying in relief camps, the people in their homes are scared to live there because of the tremors, which could be of 5.0 magnitude,” said Senapati.According to villagers, the local administration visited Natun Rongagora to take stock of the damage. Authorities at OIL have also decided to carry out a study of the induced seismicity (tremors and quakes caused by human activity including oil and gas operations).“There were some reports of tremors in nearby villages. OIL has contacted North East Institute of Science and Technology (NEIST) to carry out a study to see if there is any induced seismicity due to the blowout,” read a statement from the state-run company.The experts from NEIST are trying to ascertain the cause of the tremors. “We are in constant touch with OIL authorities. We will be sending out a seismology team and equipment to try to evaluate the situation on the ground. From a scientific point of view, we are very keen to look at what these tremors are and analyse its impact,” said G Narahari Sastry, director, North East Institute of Science and Technology (NEIST).Besides the tremors, the blowout and subsequent fire has impacted flora and fauna in Maguri Beel, located a few hundred metres away from the well and possibly in the Dibru Saikhowa National Park, around 1 km away from the well.“A group of local naturalists and some experts from Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) went around 700 metres inside Maguri Motapung wetland. We saw many insects and frogs which had died due to the fire,” said Binanda Hatibaruah, a birding tour guide based in Tinsukia.“Maguri is an important habitat for local birds and a nesting site for migratory birds. Because of the oil-like layer on the wetland, migratory birds won’t be able to stay there. We had noticed nests with eggs on the grasslands, which had been abandoned probably after the blowout,” he added.On Friday, HT had reported about a survey by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) which concluded that the blowout had polluted Maguri Motapung and the Lohit river. Meanwhile, efforts are on to control the fire at the well and plug the blowout. Equipment needed for the purpose have been mobilised, a water reservoir dug out and testing of pumps, engines and auxiliary equipment under progress, said a release issued by OIL.Protests by local groups continued to affect production at 68 oil wells and 13 gas wells operated by OIL in the region. According to the company, the protests resulted in the loss of 638 metric tonne of oil on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tremors-rocks-villages-near-assam-s-gas-well-fire-site-people-move-in-camps/story-x9fmTb8GpDsVeSGKqeHhaL.html
12-06-2020||India||Post lockdown, infiltration dips but smuggling continues across porus Indo-Bangla border||The lockdown may have taken a heavy toll on infiltration attempts across the country’s longest and most porous international border - the Indo-Bangla border in West Bengal – but it hardly seems to have had any effect on smuggling activities.Data shared by the Border Security Force shows that around 20 people were arrested while they were trying to enter India in April and May this year. In 2018 and 2019, the BSF had arrested 314 and 171 people during the same period.“There was hardly any movement of people in the bordering villages because of the lockdown. Hence it was easier to keep a watch on illegal activities such as infiltration. This has had a negative impact on such cross-border activities,” said SS Guleria, DIG of BSF (South Bengal Frontier).But when it comes to smuggling, the lockdown seems to have had little effect. This year 82 smugglers were arrested in April and May. In 2019, 85 were arrested. In 2018, the number of arrested smugglers was 28.The Indo-Bangladesh border in West Bengal is the longest international border in any state across the country. Out of the 4096.7 km long Indo-Bangla border, West Bengal alone shares 2,216 km with the neighbouring country.Large amounts of narcotics, ganja, phensedyl and FICN have been seized in the last two months compared to the same period of 2018 and 2019.“Now that infiltration has gone down and so has cattle smuggling, our main focus is on smuggling activities. Huge amounts of contraband have been seized and several people have been arrested in the months of April and May,” Guleria said.Data shows that while this year more than one kilo of narcotics was seized in April and May, in 2018 there was no seizure. In 2019 only around 100 grams was seized. This year nearly 600 kilos of ganja have been seized compared to around 100 kilos in 2018 and 59 kilos in 2019. Around 9.8 lakh FICN have been seized this April compared to 96,000 in 2019. BSF officials said that smugglers are resorting to new modus operandi to smuggle contrabands and other items. Patrolling teams have seized at least three consignments in which contrabands were hidden inside cattle carcass. The carcass was found floating down the river.In south Bengal, the border is more than 900 km long out which nearly 60% is riverine.“The trend of hiding smuggled items inside cattle carcass is something new. At least three such consignments have been seized. Earlier this week, a carcass was fished out from the river, in which the smugglers had hidden live fish seeds (baby fishes) packed in polythene packets,” said a top BSF official.The Indo-Bangladesh border, particularly in West Bengal, is also one of the most porous borders. Data placed by the union ministry of home affairs before the Parliament in March 2020 shows that in 2017, 2018 and 2019 security agencies arrested 1175, 1118 and 1351 people along the entire stretch of the Indo-Bangla border in India.With state-borders sealed, no vehicles, except those carrying essential items, were plying during the lockdown. As a result the supply of smuggled items from other states had almost stopped.“Whatever is being smuggled now is the backlog which the smugglers had stored before the lockdown. There could be some local production like ganja and narcotics,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/post-lockdown-infiltration-dips-but-smuggling-continues-across-porus-indo-bangla-border/story-IQpsYZqCTjT6gU0VMh2gvN.html

12-06-2020||India||RJD may field Tej Pratap for MLC polls in Bihar, 17 seats up for grabs||Amid indications that the election commission (EC) may soon announce polls for 17 Legislative Council seats in Bihar, hectic lobbying has begun in both the ruling NDA and Opposition alliance.Of the 17 seats, nine are from the Legislative Assembly quota and eight are from graduates’ and teachers’ constituencies.For the nine Assembly quota seats, names of building construction minister Ashok Choudhary, former acting chairman of the Council Haroon Rashid, whose terms ended last month, are doing the rounds as JD(U) probables.From the Opposition benches, RJD chief Lalu Prasad’s elder son Tej Pratap Yadav, a MLA from Mahua, could be sent to the Upper House, according to party insiders.As per the numerical strength of the parties in the state assembly, the Janata Dal United, JD(U)-BJP combine can win five seats while Rashtriya Janata Dal(RJD) -Congress can win four. Party officials familiar with the developments said the RJD was expected to stake claim on three seats while leaving one for the Congress. In the ruling alliance, the JD(U) is expected to stake claim on three seats and leave two for the BJP.The party functionaries quoted above said RJD’s top leadership wanted a “safe option” for Tej Pratap Yadav to insulate him from the uncertainty of re-election as MLA from Mahua in the upcoming assembly polls. In case Tej Pratap goes to the Upper House, he will be the third member from RJD’s first family to join the Council. His father Lalu Prasad was a member earlier and his mother Rabri Devi is a current member.The RJD officials referenced above claimed that Tej Pratap has been staying out of controversies recently after being promised a bigger say in the party affairs.State president of the RJD Jagdanand Singh, however, dismissed talks of Tej Pratap being one of the MLC nominees. “This is all baseless. No decision has been taken so far,” he said.The NDA camp seems to have a problem of plenty.“There are far too many aspirants in both JD(U) and BJP, with several former MLAs and MPs vying for a Council seat. It will be a difficult call for the JD(U) president and chief minister Nitish Kumar and BJP’s top leadership,” said a senior JD(U) leader, who didn’t want to be named.The BJP could give a second term to Sanjay Mayunk , whose term as MLC from the Assembly quota ended last month. Others in the fray are former MP Janak Ram and Radha Mohan Sharma, whose terms as MLC ended.“For graduates and teachers constituencies, the sitting MLCs would in all likelihood be given tickets,” said a senior BJP leader on condition of anonymity.According to the BJP leader, IPRD minister Neeraj Kumar and Nawal Kishore Yadav are likely to be re-fielded from Patna graduates’ constituency and Patna teachers’ constituency respectively.The four graduates’ seats are Patna, Darbhanga, Tirhut and Kosi, whereas four teachers’ constituencies are Patna, Saran, Tirhut and Darbhanga.The Council polls were scheduled to be held in April but were deferred due to the Covid-induced lockdown.According to inputs received from officials, the elections may be conducted by the end of this month or early July, when the monsoon session of the state legislature is also expected to be convened. A decision on the date of the election is likely to be taken next week, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rjd-may-field-tej-pratap-for-mlc-polls-in-bihar-17-seats-up-for-grabs/story-XAN3qbZs6lyQs6KgtCjJ5I.html

It has also been decided that barring the sadhus, pilgrims above 55 years of age will not be allowed to undertake the yatra. The yatra, as stated above, will follow the shorter Baltal route and the longer route from Pahalgam will not be used this year for the pilgrimage.“It will be regulated in view of the pandemic and all those undertaking the Yatra must possess Covid-19 negative certificates. The pilgrims will be cross-checked for Covid- 19 infection on entry into J&K before they are allowed to undertake the yatra,” said an official who did not wish to be named.For Coronavirus Live Updates“In a first of its kind initiative, the SASB is also trying to telecast the aarti live from the cave shrine, both in the morning and the evening, for the devotees,” he said.Another official said that there was also a possibility to allow the yatra only through helicopter trips.The J&K lieutenant governor’s principal secretary and CEO of SASB, Bipul Pathak said that the board is yet to take a decision on these issues.“When it is decided, the media will come to know,” Pathak said.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19The Amarnath yatra was originally scheduled to begin on June 23 through the twin tracks of Pahalgam in Anantnag district and Baltal in Ganderbal district and end on August 3 on the day of Shravan Purnima (Raksha Bandhan).Last year too, the yatra was cut short following intelligence inputs of terror threats ahead of centre’s move to scrap Article 370 that assigned special status to Jammu and Kashmir. In 2018, the pilgrimage was held for 60 days.Every year thousands of pilgrims trek to the shrine either through the traditional and longer 45-km long Pahalgam route or the shorter 14 km route through Baltal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amarnath-yatra-only-2-000-pilgrims-likely-to-be-allowed-per-day-starting-july-21/story-BFfiFLKiC2yU1lsAnbHpkM.html

Representing the petitioner, senior advocate KV Vishwanathan informed the Court that as per May 15, 2020 guidelines issued by the Health Ministry titled “Advisory for Managing Healthcare Workers working in Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 Areas of the Hospital”, only high-risk healthcare workers or those showing symptoms of the disease needed 14-day quarantine. He wondered how such a distinction could be made.The bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah said, “This is a kind of war (against the coronavirus pandemic). You cannot keep soldiers unhappy during a war. Travel the extra mile to make the corona warriors (doctors, nurses and medical staff) feel safe.”ALSO READ | ‘I salute corona warriors for risking their lives to save others’: Amit Shah at West Bengal Jan Samvad RallyVishwanathan also informed the court that doctors working at government hospitals have not been paid wages. The situation is similar in several private hospitals where there has been a wage cut.Noting these facts with concern, the bench told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who attended the virtual court hearing through videoconferencing, “These issues should not engage our attention. It should be settled by you (Government). ”Mehta submitted that the concerns expressed by the petitioner seemed to be ad-hoc. However, he informed the court that the petitioner can frame a representation highlighting their problems and the same will be addressed by the government.The bench allowed the petitioner to file a representation highlighting their concerns and suggestions to the Union Health Secretary. The Centre was directed to consider the same and file a report in court by Wednesday, the next date of hearing.Earlier, in response to the petition, the Centre had filed an affidavit claiming that conserving healthcare workforce was top most priority as the Government expected a surge in the number of coronavirus infections in the coming days.“At some point of time in the near future, apart from existing hospitals, a large number of temporary make-shift hospitals will have to be created in order to accommodate Covid-19 patients requiring admission, medical care and treatment,” the Health Ministry affidavit stated.In response to the Centre’s affidavit, the petitioner filed a reply stating that all healthcare workers serving in Covid-19 dedicated centres and hospitals, by default are under “high risk” category due to the infectious nature of this disease. The petitioner even requested the court to add states as parties to this case since the Centre had claimed that public health is a state subject.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-war-so-travel-extra-mile-to-keep-corona-warriors-happy-sc-tells-centre/story-1i1GVGsLzGueEloYxiuokJ.html
12-06-2020||India||Kota: Rare case of meningoencephalitis detected in Covid-19 deceased patient||A rare case of meningoencephalitis, an inflammation of the brain and its surrounding protective membranes, has been detected in a young patient, who died of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Kota, but doctors are yet to ascertain whether it was caused by Sars-CoV-2, which causes the disease.The authorities at the Government Medical College in Kota, which has been converted into a dedicated Covid-19 facility, are sending the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of the patient to Pune-based National Institute of Virology (NIV) to find out if the viral infection caused meningoencephalitis in the deceased patient.Earlier, a 17-year-old boy from Baran was admitted to a private hospital in Kota on June 3, and three days later he tested Covid-19 positive and died on the same day at the Government Medical College.Dr. Vijay Sardana, the principal of the Government Medical College, Kota, and also the head of the neurology department, said: “The Covid-19 patient was shifted to our hospital on June 6, but he was brought brain dead and expired a few hours after he was admitted.“We had taken the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) sample of the patient and conducted the Covid-19 test, but it didn’t show any trace of the Sars-CoV-2 infection. However, the patient didn’t have any prior history of a cerebral condition. We’re sending the CSF sample to NIV in Pune to detect the virus, which caused meningoencephalitis. We’ll report the case to the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and also study it,” he said.Sardana said only three-four cases of meningoencephalitis have been reported in Covid-19 patients from countries such as Pakistan, China, and Japan so far. India is yet to report a single case of meningoencephalitis in a Covid-19 patient.Meningoencephalitis resembles both meningitis and encephalitis. Meningoencephalitis can be caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoan or as a secondary sequel of other inflammations due to Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) is a chronic, potentially life-threatening condition caused by the human immunodeficiency virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kota-rare-case-of-meningoencephalitis-detected-in-covid-19-deceased-patient/story-DQsUgxjZcLTjnddWeHdfrI.html

12-06-2020||India||Nepal-India border tensions rise, one killed. Explained in 10 points||One Indian farmer has been killed and at least three more are injured in firing by Nepal police during an altercation with Indian farmers across the border at Sitamarhi district in Bihar. The incident comes at a time of continued tension between the two south Asian neighbours over conflicting territorial claims. Here’s a roundup of the latest incident and the geo political background in which it is happening. 1. 25-years old farmer Vikesh Kumar Rai was killed and two others, Umesh Ram and Uday Thakur received bullet injuries while working in an agricultural field in firing by Nepal security forces, said locals. Another person Lagan Rai is said to have been detained by the Nepali police across the Lalbandi-Janki Nagar border in Pipra Parsain panchayat under Sonebarsha police station in Bihar’s Sitamarhi district.2. According to another account by the director general of Sahastra Seema Bal (SSB) Kumar Rajesh Chandra, quoted by ANI, the incident took place at around 8:40 am on Friday when a family going to Nepal was stopped and asked to return by Nepali security personnel at the border. This he says led to a verbal altercation.3. Chandra told ANI that the Nepal security personnel fired around 15 rounds of ammunition including 10 in the air. He also made it clear that the firing happened inside Nepal’s territory and not on the Indian side of the border, a fact also corroborated by additional director general of police (headquarters) Jitendra Kumar.4. The officer said that the Nepali security had detained one person—identified as farmer Lagan Rai by one account-- and Indian forces were engaging their Nepali counterparts in talks to have him released to ensure that issues don’t escalate further. The external affairs ministry has not given any immediate reaction to the development. The district magistrate and the superintendent of police of Sitamarhi have rushed to the spot.5. The incident comes amid India’s sharp disagreement with Nepal’s move to revise its map laying claim to Indian territories of Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani, which fall in Uttarakhand state. Nepal’s lower house has voted for a constitutional amendment to include these territories in its official map despite India’s objections. Nepal’s parliament is holding a special meeting tomorrow to complete the amendment process.6. The border issue was first raised by Nepal PM KP Sharma Oli after India formally opened the 80-km road to Lipulekh Pass for Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims in the month of May.7. India has described Nepal’s map move as a ‘unilateral act’ not based on historical facts or evidence and has asked Kathmandu to ‘refrain’ from bringing about an ‘unjust’ and ‘artificial enlargement of territorial claims’.8. Following the map move, Nepal has increased troops presence on the border with India. The two countries share an open border of 1,880 kms. Nepal had closed its international borders on March 22 as a containment measure against the coronavirus pandemic.9. Several experts see the new map as attempt by the Nepal PM to galvanise public support by whipping up ultra-nationalistic sentiments. Some experts have also pointed to China’s close ties with Nepal’s ruling communist party to add another perspective to the issue.10. India has been supportive of all neighbours including Nepal which was supplied with 25 tonnes of medical aid, including paracetamol and hydroxychloroquine tablets, test kits and other supplies to aid in the fight against coronavirus spread. India has also taken care to ensure that the supply of essential goods to Nepal is not disrupted despite the lockdown on both sides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-india-border-tensions-rise-one-killed-explained-in-10-points/story-mf3V7E8whyjFsiPt760U1H.html

The states were requested to expedite upgradation of hospital infrastructure to manage Covid-19 cases as per projections while ensuring sufficient logistics, and trained human resources.Timely referrals, based on symptoms and improving clinical practices with the help of Centres of Excellence in collaboration with AIIMS, Delhi, was also stressed at the meeting.States were requested to undertake extensive community outreach to encourage social distancing and promotion of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in the community at all times, the health ministry said. Apart from improvement in the doubling rate, it said the recovery rate of patients has also become better.“Recovery rate of Covid positive cases continues to increase and is currently stands at 49.47 per cent,” the ministry said.

12-06-2020||India||North Bengal: Brothers forced to be in quarantine on watchtower in elephant corridor||Amar Bahadur Rai (23) didn’t expect such a hostile reception was waiting for him, when he returned to his native village on Wednesday night after one and a half years.He and his younger brother Jiwan, who had gone to Siliguri to fetch him on Wednesday upon his return from Havelock Island in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, were denied entry to Malivita Nepali basti by panic-stricken fellow villagers, who are reeling under the threat of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The villagers packed off the brothers to live on a watchtower, measuring eight square feet, which has been converted into a makeshift quarantine centre, near their village amid the elephant corridor in north Bengal’s Jalpaiguri district.The villagers are afraid that Amar might have contracted SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, and, in turn, Jiwan could also be infected. Amar, who holds a diploma in hotel management, returned home after he lost his job at a luxury resort in the Andaman & Nicobar Islands, as the viral outbreak has battered the economy, especially the hospitality sector among others.The village, which is located in the Belacoba forest range under the Rajganj police station in Jalpaiguri district, is situated around 400 metres away from the tower that doesn’t have an electricity connection.Forest department officials said it would get tough for the youth to live on the watchtower while the onset of monsoon in north Bengal was declared on Friday amid a forecast for heavy rains over the weekend. “The youth will undergo Covid-19 tests. If they test negative, they’ll be allowed entry to the village after 14 days,” said Hari Bahadur Bhujel, Amar’s uncle.Forest department officials unsuccessfully tried to prevail over the adamant villagers and convince them that keeping the youth on the watchtower is both risky and illegal.Dipak Roy Pradhan, the beat officer of Sikharpur range, said, “We tried to persuade the villagers to see reason, but they were adamant. On Thursday night, a herd of 17 elephants destroyed 200 mounds of paddy on the eastern side of the village. Fortunately, the tower is located on the northern side.”Sanjay Dutta, the ranger of Belacoba forest, said, “People have lost humanity. The watchtower is 25 feet high and the top platform measures around eight square feet. It’s dangerous to live there.”Amar said, “The management of the resort didn’t renew my contract. I came home after one and a half years. I never imagined that I’d be forced to stay on a watchtower in my own village.”He, however, wants to make the most out of a grave situation. “We’re hurt but we plan to use this opportunity to help the villagers. If we see wild elephants approaching the village, we’ll drive them away by using the battery-operated searchlights our family has given us.” There have been several unusual makeshift quarantine centres across the country to accommodate migrant returnees, but watchtower appears to be the first instance.Earlier, seven men in West Bengal’s Purulia district spent days on a treetop after they returned from Chennai on March 24, a day before nationwide lockdown restrictions were imposed.They stayed on a machan, a makeshift wood and bamboo platform set up by villagers, in a bid to save themselves from wild elephants.At Habibpur in Malda district, Niranjan Haldar (65) lived in a small country boat in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/north-bengal-brothers-forced-to-be-in-quarantine-on-watchtower-in-elephant-corridor/story-b8GHR44z6iONDX4okbABiM.html

We shall engage reputed international consultants for the design and construction,” he said.The chief minister said the Bhogapuram airport would result in the rapid development of north coastal Andhra. He said the government would plan construction of expressways from Bhogapuram to Visakhapatnam to enable the people to reach the port city faster.“The government is also planning to construct a metro rail network in Visakhapatnam that would be extended up to the Bhogapuram airport, so that it would reduce the burden on road travel.

12-06-2020||India||J&K: Congress demands security for all sarpanches and panchayat members||The Congress party has demanded security for all sarpanches and panchayat members in Jammu and Kashmir, saying they are vulnerable to attacks by terrorists.The demand came days after the Congress sarpanch from Lukbhawan in south Kashmir, Ajay Pandita, was killed by terrorists on Monday afternoon. Pandita was the second Congress sarpanch to be killed by terrorists in the region in the past two years.The Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress president, Ghulam Ahmad Mir, said the party has been demanding for the past few months that the government should provide security to vulnerable panchayat members. “But nobody bothers,” he said.“After the killing of Ajay Pandita, we have been demanding security for panches and sarpanches on a daily basis, but still nothing has been done,” he said, adding Pandita had himself made requests for security to the government several times.“Many panchayat members and other political leaders are facing threats but they still haven’t been given security. We will be writing to the Central government after a meeting,” Mir said.After the Central government scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status on August 5 last year, many mainstream political leaders were arrested and the security of several leaders, especially those from the Congress, was downgraded, he said.“Though I’m a former minister and legislator and also Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee president, my security was downgraded. In Jammu, I don’t have any security and the same is the case with other leaders of the Congress and other mainstream political parties,” he added.The BJP too demanded security for panchayat members soon after Pandita’s killing.“We have been demanding security for panchayat members from a long time, but nothing happened,” said BJP spokesman and sarpanch Altaf Thakur.Director general of police Dilbag Singh has blamed the Hizbul Mujahideen for the killing of Pandita and said the terrorists responsible for the attack had been identified.However, the Jammu and Kashmir government hasn’t said whether security will be provided to panchayat members. Panchayat elections were held in the region in 2018 and the two prominent mainstream political parties – the National Conference and Congress – had boycotted the polls. Many panchayats are still vacant as no politician had filed nominations for these posts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/j-k-congress-demands-security-for-all-sarpanches-and-panchayat-members/story-b6zqt5ldFpHQLgHhcsmhgL.html

The Congress initially dithered and denied any meeting between the two, even terming it fake news. However, they did admit later that Rahul Gandhi had met the envoy.Subsequently, Gandhi tweeted saying, “It is my job to be informed on critical issues. I met the Chinese ambassador, ex-NSA, Congress leaders from NE & the Bhutanese ambassador.” Ravi Shankar Prasad posted the same tweet from 2017 to take a swipe at the Congress leader.“RahulGandhi is asking the Prime Minister to share in public facts about sensitive China border issues. I think Mr.Gandhi has a parallel information system in place. Did he not meet the Chinese envoy during the Doklam crisis? Denied it initially but accepted it after public outcry,” said Prasad. RahulGandhi is asking the Prime Minister to share in public facts about sensitive China border issues.

Scheduled to be held in the first quarter of next year, the Mahakumbh in 2010 had attracted 50 million pilgrims and this time, before the epidemic, officials had expected that over 120 million pilgrims would participate in the fair next year.Keeping in mind the Covid-19 situation, the apex body of the Akhadas---Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad- has stated that it is not averse to holding the Kumbh mela in a restrictive manner with only a selected lot of Akhada saints allowed to take part in the fair, adhering to social distancing norms.Akhada Parishad is of the view that the foremost priority of the government should be to hold the Kumbh in a proper way if the situation turns normal, but in case such a situation arises wherein the coronavirus spread threatens the Kumbh pilgrimage then it should be held in a restrictive manner and at a small level.“Be it Mughal or British era or post-independence, the Kumbh mela has been held at the same date decided as per astrological calculations. Kumbh 2021 will also be held at an auspicious time decided by astrologers but as coronavirus spread has now touched the 10,000 positive patients per day mark, in special circumstances we are ready to carry out the fair in a small and ritualistic-symbolic manner only,” Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj, general secretary of Akhada Parishad said.To ensure hassle-free hosting of the Mahakumbh Mela, Akhada Parishad will also organise a three-day major worship ritual across the country from June 21.These rituals are being conducted for the successful hosting of the Mahakumbh and the eradication of coronavirus from the planet.Akhada Parishad has also cautioned all the temple-ashram management committees to close respective temples for pilgrims if they come across any violation of social distancing and preventive measures by devotees. Additional Kumbh Mela officer Lalit Narayan Mishra said that the mela administration is ensuring time-bound completion of work related to the Kumbh and readying for the mega fair as per the schedule.Mishra pointed out that “as still more than six months are left for the mega fair, the mela administration is ensuring the best possible facilities for pilgrims who come for the Kumbh.”Under the Kumbh Mela budget, an amount of about Rs 350 crore has been sanctioned for various infrastructural work. These have a deadline of November 2020.Religious scholar Shiv Charan Naudiyal pointed out that whether the coronavirus gets contained or remains stable, pilgrims will arrive for Kumbh and the holy Ganga dip as faith transcends all hurdles and boundaries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahakumbh-2021-may-not-see-mass-participation-owing-to-covid-19-akhada-parishad/story-ZyM0sB78n5fD0pPQnwn3iI.html

Uttar Pradesh, which is India’s most populous state, accounts for only 12,088 of the national tally.UP chief secretary Amit Mohan Prasad said 7,609 patients had fully recovered from Covid-19 infection in the state and had been sent home following treatment.“A total of 7,609 residents have been cured of the disease and they have returned home. Our recovery rate has improved to 60.31%,” Prasad was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The national recovery rate is close to 50 %, which means 147,194 infected people have been cured of the virus so far leaving 141,842 active cases.On the testing front, the state’s most senior bureaucrat claimed that Uttar Pradesh had reached a milestone on Thursday by testing more than 15,000 samples in a day. He added that it aims to reach the 20,000 tests-a-day mark by the end of this month.“15,607 samples were tested in the state yesterday. The target is to test 20,000 samples daily by the end of June. A total of 4 lakh 19 thousand samples have been tested in state’s different labs,” Prasad said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesCovid-19 positive cases had risen in Uttar Pradesh in the last month due to many returning migrants –arriving from other hotspots in Maharashtra, Delhi and Tamil Nadu among others—bringing the disease to the state with them.A few days ago, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath had told chief editor of Hindi news daily Hindustan that his government will not let even a single coronavirus patient fend for himself. He added that every infected patient in the state was being treated free of cost at government hospitals in the state.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Agra, Noida, Lucknow and Ghaziabad are amongst the worst affected districts in the state and the state administration has told the Supreme Court that it intends to continue restrictions on movement between Delhi and these two neighbouring districts of Uttar Pradesh to prevent an exponential rise in positive cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-s-recovery-rate-at-over-60-is-almost-10-more-than-the-national-average/story-ltkzloTKIFWQlSAtoE5xyN.html

12-06-2020||India||Delhi HC slaps Rs 20,000 fine on student who challenged lifting of lockdown||The Delhi High Court on Friday imposed a fine of Rs 20,000 on a petitioner who had challenged the Centre’s decision to relax the nationwide lockdown from June 1, saying that the decision of re-opening had been ordered in a phased manner and was not one that appeared to have been taken in haste.The high court said the reopening was done to ensure a proper balance between containing the spread of the infectious Covid-19 disease and ensuring that people were not forced to starve. The Centre, after four phases of lockdown adding up to more than two months, had announced staggered reopening of economic activity in a bid to save livelihoods.ALSO READ | Plea in High Court seeks reimposition of lockdown in DelhiThe Delhi high court’s order came while dismissing with a penalty of Rs 20,000 a public interest litigation (PIL) by a law student challenging the May 30 order of the Centre by which the lockdown was extended only in containment zones which had a high concentration of coronavirus positive patients.The reopening of economic activity, shops, markets, sports stadiums and the like was done in a phased manner only outside containment zones. Inter-state travel too had been permitted in a phased manner by the Union government.A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramanium Prasad said the government is expected to remain cognizant of the situation and evaluate it closely and if it is found that the rate of coronavirus infection is going up, they can always review their decision and impose curbs, depending upon the prevalent situation.The petition had sought imposition of a lockdown on grounds that during the earlier lockdown period, the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases was low. The plea said by allowing the movement of people and economic activities in the country, “The spread of the virus has severely spiked, resulting in a sharp rise in the number of daily cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-slaps-rs-20-000-fine-on-student-who-challenged-lifting-of-lockdown/story-N8o6AEzzrTMuFAbodi829J.html

12-06-2020||India||‘In war, you don’t make soldiers unhappy’: SC on non-payment of salaries to doctors||“In war, you do not make soldiers unhappy. Travel extra mile and channel some extra money to address their grievances,” the Supreme Court said on Friday taking serious note of non-payment of salary and lack of proper accommodation to doctors engaged in fight against Covid-19. The courts should not be involved in the issue of non-payment of salary to health care workers and government should settle the issue, it said.The top court was hearing a plea by a doctor, who alleged that front line healthcare workers engaged in fight against Covid-19 are not being paid salaries or their salaries are being cut or delayed.The doctor also questioned the Centre’s new SOP making their 14-day quarantine non-mandatory. “In war, you do not make soldiers unhappy. Travel extra mile and channel some extra money to address grievances. Country cannot afford to have dissatisfied soldiers in this war which is being fought against Corona,” said a bench of Justices Ashok Bhushan, S K Kaul and MR Shah. Also read | Indian-origin doctor performs first lung transplant for Covid-19 patient in USSolicitor General Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, said that if there are better suggestions coming forward, they can be accommodated. The bench said that there are reports coming that many areas doctors are not being paid. “We saw report that doctors went on strike. In Delhi, some doctors have not been paid for past three months. These are concerns that should have been taken care off. It should not require court intervention.” The bench further said, “You (Centre) need to do more. Must make sure their concerns are addressed”. The bench posted the matter for further hearing next week. On June 4, the Centre had told the top court that a “large number” of make-shift hospitals will have to be built in the near future to accommodate the constant rise in the number of newly infected people. The Centre also contended that though hospitals are responsible for implementing the Infection Prevention and Control (IPC) activities, the final responsibility lies with the health care workers to protect themselves from Covid-19. It further said mandatory quarantine for 14 days after the duty of healthcare workers of 7/14 days is “not justified and warranted”. “It is most respectfully submitted that number of cases of Covid-19 are constantly increasing and at some point of time in near future, apart from existing hospitals, large number of temporary make-shift hospitals will have to be created in order to accommodate Covid-19 patients requiring admission, medical care and treatment,” the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said in an affidavit. The affidavit was filed on a plea by Arushi Jain who questioned the Centre’s new Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) of May 15 for front line Covid-19 healthcare workers by which it ended the 14-day mandatory quarantine for them. The ministry in its reply affidavit had said healthcare workers (HCW) are properly protected by Personal Protective Equipments (PPE) in workplace settings and carry no additional risk to their families or children. It had said grievances raised by the petitioner alleging infirmities in the May 15 guidelines of the health ministry are completely presumptuous, vacuous, ill-founded and sans any empirical or medical evidence.Justifying its advisory and SOPs, the health ministry said it is a step in the right direction and that the guidelines emphasise the role of taking adequate preventive measures by all health care workers in the hospital setting against the likelihood of contracting infection at their work place.On April 8, the apex court had observed that the doctors and medical staff are the “first line of defence of the country” in the battle against Covid-19 pandemic, and directed the Centre to ensure that appropriate PPEs are made available to them for treating coronavirus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-war-you-don-t-make-soldiers-unhappy-sc-on-non-payment-of-salaries-to-doctors/story-ThVi1CVp3I8Tn7Ing2TcKN.html

We are taking up this matter strongly from the court to the Election Commission. The ruling party cannot intimidate us,” said Singhvi.Fearing poaching, the Congress had shifted its legislators to various resorts in Gujarat in the one last week, dividing them in zone-wise groups. While some MLAs gathered in Rajkot in Saurashtra, few others were in Abu Road in Rajasthan.Recently, three Congress MLAs - Brijesh Merja, Akshay Patel and Jitu Chaudhary - has resigned, diminishing the chances of the Congress winning the second Rajya Sabha seat as its tally in the 182-member House now stands at 65.Five Congress legislators - Somabhai Patel, Praveen Maru, JV Kakadia, Mangal Gavit and Pradyuman Singh Jadeja - had resigned earlier in March.The total strength of the Gujarat assembly now stands at 172. The ruling BJP has 103 legislators, the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) two and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) one.

12-06-2020||India||‘Transactional and episodic’: Rahul Gandhi on India-US ties||The partnership between India and the United States worked because both were tolerant nations but sadly that DNA of tolerance has now disappeared, former Congress president Rahul Gandhi said on Friday.In a video conversation with former US under secretary of state, Nicholas Burns, Gandhi also said the Indo-US relationship, which used to be a partnership earlier, now seems to have become “very transactional and episodic.”“I think why our partnership works is because we are tolerant systems. You mentioned that you are an immigrant nation. We are a very tolerant nation. Our DNA is supposed to be tolerant. We are supposed to accept new ideas,” the Congress leader said while responding to Burns who insisted that both India and the United States shared many traits.“We are supposed to be open but the surprising thing is that that DNA that open DNA is sort of disappearing. I mean I say this with sadness that I don’t see that level of tolerance that I used to see. I don’t see it in the United States and I don’t see it in India,” Gandhi said.Describing the death of African-American George Floyd in police custody as “horrible”, Burns said the people in the US were protesting over his killing.“We are protesting and that is our right. And millions of Americans are protesting for our rights the way you have in India. And India and the US share many traits as we both have liberated ourselves from British in different years…. The US is in a deep political and existential crisis that has gripped us all,” he said, adding the US adopted the idea of protesting in a non-violent way from Mahatma Gandhi.The former US diplomat further said India and the United States can work together not to fight an “authoritarian” China but to make it observe the rule of law.“I think that India and the US can be working together. Not as you say not to fight China, but to make it observe the rule of law as we try to live together in this world,” he said.Burns served in the US government for 27 years and as a career foreign service officer, he was under secretary of state for political affairs during 2005-08, the state department’s third-ranking official when he led negotiations on the India-US civil nuclear agreement.For his part, Gandhi said the Indo-US relationship has now become “very transactional” and “episodic” and no longer a partnership it used to be earlier.“A relationship that used to be very broad -- education, defence, healthcare, multiple fronts -- has sort of focused down mainly on defence,” Gandhi said.Burns said not just the governments of the US and India, but their societies were very closely intertwined and that is a great strength.“If you think that one of the challenges we face is the coming power of authoritarian countries. I mentioned two before, China and Russia. We never want to fight, we don’t want war but we want to preserve our way of life and we want to preserve our positions in the world,” he said.Burns said the relationship between India and the US is important and the two governments should combine forces to promote human freedom, democracy and rule of people in the world.“I think that is a powerful idea that Indians and Americans can bring together to the rest of the world. Again, you know, we are not looking for a conflict with China, but we are waging, in a way, a battle of ideas with China,” he added.Gandhi also hit out at the divisions prevailing in both the countries, saying they weaken nations.“When you divide African Americans, Mexicans and other people in the United States, so you divide Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs in India, you’re weakening the structure of the country. But then the same people who weaken the structure of the country say that they are the nationalists,” the former Congress chief said.The dialogue was a part of Gandhi’s series of video conversations with global and Indian thought leaders to discuss the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences on the Indian economy.In the past, the Congress chief interacted with former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan, Nobel Laureate Professor Abhijit Banerjee, Harvard Professor Ashish Jha, Swedish epidemiologist Johan Giesecke and Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/transactional-and-episodic-rahul-gandhi-on-india-us-ties/story-SdH5yOLTJL77HcQxS39jiI.html
12-06-2020||India||‘Search your soul’: Bengal Governor on video of mistreatment of decomposed bodies||The issue of decomposed body, allegedly of a Covid-19 patient, being mistreated in West Bengal has brought the ruling Trinamool Congress in the crosshairs of the Opposition and Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar.Dhankar accused the government of not showing respect to the dead.“Anguished at disposal of dead bodies @MamataOfficial -with heartless indescribable insensitivity. Not sharing videos due to sensitivity. Have sought an URGENT UPDATE @HomeSecretaryWB. In our society dead body is accorded highest respect-rituals r performed as per tradition,” Dhankhar said in one of the tweets on Thursday. Anguished at disposal of dead bodies @MamataOfficial -with heartless indescribable insensitivity. Not sharing videos due to sensitivity. Have sought an URGENT UPDATE @HomeSecretaryWBIn our society dead body is accorded highest respect-rituals r performed as per tradition(1/3)Also Watch | Junior doctors protest over inadequate attention to non-Covid patients in WB The video which surfaced on social media on Thursday showed a morgue employee dragging the body by the neck with tongs at a crematorium in Kolkata. The employee could be further seen putting the body inside a van.Local Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) workers made claims before the media that the van carried several decomposed corpses and the stench was unbearable. They also said that they objected to the cremation and made several videos.The BJP and Communist Party of India (Marxist) claimed that the corpses could be those of Covid-19 victims. The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) and the health department, however, produced records which showed that unclaimed bodies lying at hospital morgues were supposed to be cremated at the Garia crematorium since the Dhapa dumping ground, where such unclaimed bodies are cremated round the year, has been reserved for Hindus dying of Covid-19. An order to this effect was passed by KMC’s chief health officer on May 29. HT has seen the documents.But West Bengal BJP president Dilip Ghosh alleged the corpses were of Covid-19 patients. “The government tried to hide the truth. Apparently, the bodies were burnt with acid,” Ghosh claimed.“We want to know the identity and addresses of these dead people,” said CPI(M) legislator Sujan Chakraborty. He even wrote a letter to Kolkata mayor Firhad Hakim.Hakim said that the corpses were unclaimed and had been lying in a government hospital morgue. “The KMC issued an order on May 29, saying unclaimed bodies would be cremated at the Garia crematorium and the Dhapa crematorium used exclusively for corpses of Hindu victims of Covid-19,” said Hakim.Professor Saibal Mukherjee, principal, NRS Medical College and Hospital, wrote a letter to Kolkata Police Commissioner Anuj Sharma on Thursday evening. He said the bodies were related to cases registered in different police stations and none of these people were Covid-19 patients. “The subject of the video is fake and you may please take necessary action in this regard,” Prof Mukherjee wrote to Sharma.The controversy, however, continued on Friday.“Issue is not whether the dead bodies were Covid ones! That is matter of probe. Issue-How human bodies can be so shamelessly dragged! Being treated worse than animals. To those engaging in diversion - Search your soul and conscience and imagine dead body was related to you!” Dhankhar tweeted on Friday morning. Issue is not whether the dead bodies were Covid ones !

Virtual admission about callous handling of dead bodies promising procedure will be stream lined.

With Unlock 0.1 on, he came up his first short film based on the subject that was widely debated during the entire lockdown period.“The issue of not paying the domestic helps and labourers has been vastly discussed in the last few months. The subject touched me in many ways and I am thrilled with the phenomenal response it has received, clocking 1.2 lac views in just two days along with lot of appreciation,” said the UPite over phone.The film was shot in May end during lockdown 5.0, telling more about his venture Karan said, “Though it’s a small film but still it was a cumbersome task to do. Also my main aim was to let the message reach far and wide. I was shooting at my house in Lokhandwala while my co-actor Preeti Verma shot her part at her place. We have shot the film with our personal phones. It took five days to shoot my part.” The story was developed by Bobby Khan who also happens to be a virtual director the film. “Shantanu Srivastava, producer for my next film, suggested me do a short film based on the current scenario. Bobby’s script had many layers — frustration of females in absence of house help, plight of daily labourers, job insecurity and humanitarian crisis. Since this was my first short film, I wanted to prove it to all the directors and top-makers, I have worked with that I can’t be expert like them but I too have a small maker in me. After all I can’t afford to go wrong after being part of films like ‘Baby’, ‘Gundey’, ‘Kick’ and ‘Rangeela Raja’,” he adds.His film ‘Azad Maidan’ was supposed to start in April in Mumbai which is now postponed. “When lockdown happened like everyone else I was too all confused. I had realised that I need to remain positive and make use of this time. Being a black belt holder, I started my martial arts training again besides dance, body-weight training and yoga. I kept my mind occupied also got more into meditation to explore my spiritual self,”Karan got two films in this period. “I have signed for a digital film to be shot in Mumbai, Surat and Goa probably in October or November. It has two male leads. There is another film to be shot in and around Lucknow in April next year,” Karan shared.His last visit to hometown Prayagraj was during Diwali. “I want to go back to Sangam city as soon as possible to meet my parents and siblings. As soon as things get a bit normal, I want to be with them for sometime before work restarts,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/how-karan-unlocked-the-lockdown-blues/story-HVoVpWp0Vh9j73YLJr4nNK.html
12-06-2020||India||No decision on fresh lockdown, says Maharashtra CM||Amid speculation about the Maharashtra government imposing a fresh Covid-19 lockdown following a spike in infections, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray clarified on Friday no such decision has been made by his government. He appealed to the people to strictly follow existing Covid-19-related restrictions to keep the spread of the Coronavirus in check.As messages made the rounds of social media platforms about the state government planning to impose a fresh lockdown from next week, there was confusion and fear among citizens.Responding to these concerns, Thackeray’s office issued a statement on Friday morning that made it clear no such decision had been made by the state government.“There are rumours being spread through social media and reports on some channels that the state government has taken a decision to impose lockdown by shutting down all the shops and commercial establishments. We have not taken any such decision,” the statement said.“Any such reports create confusion among the people. Spreading such false news is violation of the law and should not be transmitted without confirmation.”Thackeray had on Wednesday said that though there was no decision on a fresh lockdown, the authorities may be forced to impose one if people don’t follow Covid-19-related restrictions.He had said, “The threat of Covid-19 has not passed, it still persists. As we continue to battle the pandemic, we cannot put the brakes on the wheels of the economy. We were shocked looking at the crowd on the first day.“Outdoor physical activities are permitted for your good health and not to spoil it. People will have to keep physical distance. The government is evaluating the situation. If we feel that the lifting of lockdown is life-threatening, then we will be forced to impose the lockdown again.”Thackeray, in his statement on Friday, said citizens shouldn’t take undue advantage of the easing of curbs by the government.“Lifting of the lockdown norms does not mean people are allowed to step out, leading to crowding at public places [that] could prove hazardous for health. Maintaining social distancing, masking the face and sanitisation at regular intervals should be adopted now as part of the lifestyle,” he said, adding everybody should follow self-discipline for their own health and that of their loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-decision-on-fresh-lockdown-says-maharashtra-cm/story-3kr7BmQKsffZaD69uyx5lM.html

Taking cognisance of media reports, a three-judge bench sought detailed status reports from four states - Delhi, Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal - regarding the conditions in hospitals.“Covid-19 patients are treated worse than animals. In one case, a dead body was found in garbage,” the bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan remarked.The state of Delhi came in for heavy criticism from the bench, with the court pointing out the conditions in hospitals as well the reduced testing for Covid-19. The top court also noted that patients are running from pillar to post to get themselves admitted even though a large number of beds in government hospitals are lying vacant.Also Watch | ‘Send migrants home within 15 days, drop cases’: Key points from SC order Taking note of a media report, the court highlighted how dead bodies of Covid-19 patients were lying unattended in the lobby and waiting area of Delhi’s Lok Nayak Jai Prakash hospital.Reminding states, the top court said that governments are duty bound to ensure adequate infrastructure in hospitals and also that Covid-19 patients are attended to by health workers.Former union law minister and senior counsel Ashwini Kumar had written to the CJI on June 8 highlighting the undesirable manner in which Covid-19 patients and dead bodies of Covid victims were being handled in various parts of the country.Kumar pointed out a news report of a Covid-19 patient being chained to a bed in a hospital in Madhya Pradesh. He also drew the attention of the CJI to an incident from Puducherry where a dead body was thrown into a pit for burial.Right to die with dignity is a fundamental right and it includes the right to a decent burial/ cremation, Kumar had said in his letter.This would be the third case which the top court would be hearing suo motu in relation to issues stemming out of Covid-19 and the lockdown.The same three-judge bench, headed by justice Ashok Bhushan, is hearing the case regarding the plight of migrant workers due to the Covid-19 lockdown and had passed orders to facilitate their return to their home states after thousands of them went out of work due to the lockdown imposed by the central and state governments.The bench on June 9 ordered that the central and state governments should ensure the return of all migrant workers to their home states within 15 days and also asked the governments to come up with welfare schemes and job opportunities to alleviate their sufferings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patients-treated-worse-than-animals-bodies-found-in-garbage-supreme-court/story-hQFignge7R9PKvpoRjW3kM.html

12-06-2020||India||From Moderna to Regeneron: Where do Covid-19 vaccine trials stand||Researchers and scientists are racing to develop treatment and vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), which has affected more than 7 million people and killed over 420,000 across the world.More than 150 groups all over the world are developing various vaccines for Covid-19 and at least 10 of them have entered the clinical trial phase. Here’s the latest on how the companies have fared:ModernaModerna Inc on Thursday confirmed it plans to start a trial of 30,000 volunteers of its much-anticipated coronavirus vaccine in July as the company enters the final stage of testing.The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based biotech said the primary goal of the study would be to prevent symptomatic Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.The key secondary goal would be the prevention of severe disease, as defined by keeping people out of the hospital.China National Biotec Group CoChina is offering employees of some large state-run companies the option of being inoculated with two coronavirus vaccines currently in development, showing how quickly the country is moving to test the viability of its homegrown shots.Employees intending to travel overseas for work can volunteer to be administered vaccinations developed by China National Biotec Group Co or CNBG, a subsidiary of Beijing-based Sinopharm Group Co, Bloomberg has reported.Bloomberg said the proposal was relayed to state-owned companies by the government body that oversees them.CNBG is among the Chinese companies bidding to create a successful vaccine against the new coronavirus. There are currently five Chinese vaccine candidates in the human trial stage, competing with products being developed by global pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna that can bring an end to the pandemic.Emergent BioSolutionsEmergent BioSolutions has said it has signed an $87 million deal to make AstraZeneca Plc’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine in the United States, boosting the British drugmaker’s efforts to bring a vaccine to the market.Emergent said, under the agreement, large-scale manufacturing of the vaccine will be done at its Baltimore Bayview facility, which has the capacity to produce up to hundreds of millions of doses annually.AstraZeneca has said that the first indication of the effectiveness of its vaccine would likely be available in June or July. However, experts have cautioned that a safe and effective vaccine could take at least 12 to 18 months from the start of development.Johnson & JohnsonJohnson & Johnson said it had fast-tracked the start of human clinical trials for its recombinant Ad26.COV2-S vaccine by two months to the second half of July, which was initially planned for September. The decision may allow the American firm to take part in the massive clinical trials program or Operation Warp Speed planned by the US government.The vaccine candidate developed by J&J is based on adenovirus, a virus which causes the common cold, and it plans to test its efficacy and safety against a placebo by giving the doses to both younger and older volunteers. The company is also in talks with the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to start larger, late-stage trials ahead of schedule, depending on results of the early studies and regulatory approval. Eli LillyThe drug giant has said that its antibody-drug to treat Covid-19 patients can be available as early as September. It is testing three antibodies therapies to cure Covid-19, one of which is slated to enter clinical trials in the coming weeks, while human trials have already been conducted on the other two therapies.The drug company’s chief scientific officer Daniel Skovronsky said in an interview with Reuters that they could have a possible treatment for the virus available if all goes well with the two antibody therapies it is testing.Skovronsky said the company is also doing preclinical studies of third antibody treatment for the illness caused by the novel coronavirus that could enter human clinical trials in the coming weeks.It has reportedly already launched human trials with two of the experimental therapies. One of them, currently designated as LY-CoV555, is being developed in partnership with Canadian biotech AbCellera. The other, JS016, is being developed with Chinese drugmaker Shanghai Junshi Biosciences.SinovacChina’s Sinovac Biotech has turned to Brazil, the epicentre of Latin America’s outbreak, for at least part of its final testing. The government of São Paulo announced Thursday that Sinovac will ship enough of its experimental vaccine to test in 9,000 Brazilians starting next month.São Paulo’s governor Joao Doria has said if it works, “with this vaccine we will be able to immunize millions of Brazilians”.Indian companiesThe Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has partnered with University of Oxford to ramp up trials and vaccine development. SII plans to start production of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by the Oxford University in the next two to three weeks and plans to bring the vaccination for the general public by the end of October if the vaccine candidate gets approved.It has said that it is investing $100 million on the Oxford vaccine. The company along with pharma company AstraZeneca has said that the AZD1222 vaccine would be supplied to India as well as other low-income countries. Panacea Biotec Ltd has said it would partner with US-based Refana Inc to make a potential Covid-19 vaccine. The firms aim to make more than 500 million doses of the vaccine candidate and around 40 million doses are expected to be ready by early next year, Panacea told the stock exchanges.

12-06-2020||India||Delhi’s crematoriums overwhelmed with coronavirus dead||When Raj Singh’s 70-year-old mother died from the coronavirus in India’s capital, he took comfort in the prospect of a proper cremation, the funeral rite that Hindus believe releases the soul from the cycle of rebirth.But instead of chanting sacred Vedic hymns and sprinkling holy water from the Ganges River, all Singh could do was place his mother’s wrapped corpse on a wooden pyre and along with a handful of relatives watch it burn.“I never thought I would watch my mother go like this,” he said.Like elsewhere in the world, the novel coronavirus has made honouring the dead in New Delhi a hurried affair, largely devoid of the rituals that give it meaning for mourners. Cemeteries and crematoriums are overwhelmed, so there isn’t much time for ceremony, and even if there were, the government limits the number of people allowed at funerals and those in attendance must maintain distance and wear masks.“The whole grieving process has been interrupted,” said Pappu, who goes by only one name and lights the funeral pyres at Nigambodh Ghat, New Delhi’s biggest crematorium.New Delhi has officially reported close to 1,100 deaths from the coronavirus, but cemeteries and crematoriums in the city say the actual number is several hundred higher. Hospital morgues are beyond capacity, and with summer temperatures reaching 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Farenheit) some bodies are being kept on thick ice slabs.“In the beginning, I used to carry only one body. Now, helpers at the morgue will stack as many bodies as they can fit in my van,” said Bhijendra Dhigya, who drives a hearse from one New Delhi hospital to the crematorium.The spike in deaths in New Delhi comes amid a broader virus surge throughout India, where authorities are reporting some 10,000 new infections each day and more than 300 deaths. Nevertheless, India lifted most of the remaining restrictions from its 10-week lockdown on June 8, the same day it recorded what at the time was its highest single-day death toll from the virus.On Friday, India’s nationwide caseload overtook Britain to became the fourth highest in the world with 297,535 confirmed cases and 8,498 deaths, according to the Health Ministry. But that is just the known cases. Like elsewhere in the world, the actual number of infections is thought to be far higher for a number of reasons including limited testing.New Delhi’s health centers are under immense strain and the state government’s deputy chief minister, Manish Sisodia, said this week that a state health department model has projected a worst case scenario in which the number of infections in the capital — already at nearly 35,000 — could reach 550,000 by the end of July.In the worst case scenario, Sisodia said New Delhi would need 80,000 hospital beds, far more than the roughly 9,000 hospital beds currently available for virus patients. The state government is considering taking hotels and sports stadiums to use as field hospitals.The capital’s Nigambodh Ghat crematorium has handled more than 500 coronavirus cremations since the beginning of the outbreak. When some of its gas-fueled incinerators broke down, there was no one willing to repair them, so the staff reverted to traditional wooden pyres.Even with working hours extended, there has been no time for individual cremation ceremonies and exhaustive rituals with incense, garlands of marigold and chanting.The crematorium is now largely quiet except for the distinct snap and crackle of the burning wood and the din of sirens from ambulances bringing more bodies.The virus has upended Muslim burial rituals in the city as well.Islamic burials normally involve a simple ceremony. Before the body is laid to rest, it is washed. Those attending the funeral are allowed to have a look at the face of the dead and a prayer is performed, followed by a sermon from a cleric. Then close family members help place the body in a grave.Now bodies arrive at New Delhi’s largest Muslim cemetery in hearses manned by crews in hazmat suits. Bodies aren’t washed and mourners can’t view them. There are no sermons.The cemetery has already seen more than 200 burials of Covid-19 victims and with bodies steadily arriving, the grounds are filling fast.On a recent day at the burial of a 22-year-old man who died of the virus, a backhoe dug a grave as four relatives said a speedy prayer. The body was then lowered into the grave by ropes.Mohammad Shameem, a gravedigger who now oversees the burials, shook his head in disapproval as the backhoe quickly carved out another grave.“That’s not how burials should happen,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-crematoriums-overwhelmed-with-coronavirus-dead/story-HG0lTe01Q9AV2gHUsVsoPP.html

Chief Minister Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray has requested and appealed to the people not to crowd anywhere and follow the instructions given by the government,” tweeted chief minister Thackeray’s office.Also Watch | Maharashtra’s covid cases go past China’s total tally, over 7 million cases worldwide In Maharashtra, which has the highest number of coronavirus cases in the country, the number of Covid-19 cases crossed 97,000, with 3,590 deaths on Friday. It has outnumbered the total number of cases in China. Thackeray had on Wednesday said that though there was no decision on a fresh lockdown, the authorities may be forced to impose one if people don’t follow Covid-19-related restrictions.He had said, “The threat of Covid-19 has not passed, it still persists. As we continue to battle the pandemic, we cannot put the brakes on the wheels of the economy. We were shocked looking at the crowd on the first day.“Outdoor physical activities are permitted for your good health and not to spoil it. People will have to keep physical distance. The government is evaluating the situation. If we feel that the lifting of lockdown is life-threatening, then we will be forced to impose the lockdown again.”State health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said 500 additional ICU beds will be made available within a week in Mumbai. He suggested limited resumption of suburban train services in the metropolis.The recovery rate of patients in Mumbai is now 50 per cent. The number of patients testing positive for Covid-19 in Dharavi (once a hotspot) has also come down significantly, the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-not-to-be-re-announced-in-maharashtra-tweets-cm-thackeray-s-office/story-BiC63grthO4FyTGdJbEHVJ.html

12-06-2020||India||Loan moratorium case: SC asks whether there be additional interest on EMIs||The Supreme Court on Friday asked officials of the Union finance ministry and Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to convene a joint meeting within three days to decide whether interest on EMIs during the six month moratorium period till August 31 can be charged by banks.The top court was hearing public interest litigation (PIL) by an Agra resident, Gajendra Sharma, who demanded a waiver on interest charged by a private bank citing the relief earlier announced by RBI on the payment of equated monthly instalments (EMIs) between March and August 31 due to the coronavirus pandemic.The central bank had on March 27 ordered a three-month moratorium till May 31 on EMIs in order to ease the financial burden on borrowers during the lockdown. This period was further extended till August 31 by a recent RBI circular.Borrowers, who availed this facility, were told by the lending banks that the interest during the March-August period will get added to their loan amount. This would prolong the loan instalments or borrowers could get their interest component increased.“Our concern in these proceedings is only whether the interest that has been deferred for three months will be added to charges payable later and whether there will be interest on interest,” the top court said, according to news agency ANI.The three-member bench had taken exception about banks levying interests on loans when RBI had announced a moratorium on loan repayments.“On one hand you are granting moratorium (on loans) but continuing with interest. It is more detrimental,” the three-member bench, comprising Justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul, and MR Shah, said on June 4.The Supreme Court has posted the matter for hearing on Wednesday now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/loan-moratorium-case-sc-asks-whether-there-be-additional-interest-on-emis/story-ZeacKfyMhbut1A9mzWB7kK.html
12-06-2020||India||China has fearful leadership, lacks openness like India or US: Nicholas Burns||Former US under secretary of state Nicholas Burns on Friday dismissed suggestions China is winning the battle against Covid-19 and said the crisis should have been jointly tackled by the leadership of the US, India and China within the G20 framework.In a video conversation with former Congress president Rahul Gandhi, Burns said the sort of cooperation expected from US President Donald Trump, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn’t happen, largely because the American leader “doesn’t believe in international cooperation” and is “a unilateralist”, while Xi wanted to compete with Trump.Asked by Gandhi why there has been no global cooperation to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, Burns said: “It is a terrible disappointment to me. I’m sure it is to you. You know, this crisis was made for the G20. It was made for Prime Minister Modi and President Xi Jinping and Donald Trump to be working together, all of our countries for the common global good.”He added, “Even the US and China are at the heart of the problem here. I hope when the next crisis comes, they will do better to work together in a more effective way.”China, Burns added, lacks the sophistication and openness of a democratic country such as India or the US and has a “fearful leadership”.“I think a lot of people right now are saying China is going to surpass, China’s winning the battle of coronavirus, that it is gaining hearts and minds. I actually don’t see that,” he said.“China certainly has extraordinary power in the world. Probably not equal to the US militarily, economically, politically yet, but it’s gaining, no question about it. What China lacks is the sophistication and openness of a democratic country like India or the US,” Burns added.The remarks from the former diplomat who played a key role in finalising the India-US civil nuclear deal came against the backdrop of a border stand-off between India and China.India and China are currently engaged in diplomatic and military contacts for an “early resolution” of the stand-off between their border troops that emerged in public in early May. Earlier this week, the two sides began what Indian officials described as a “limited military disengagement” at three hot spots along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, which has been the focus of the tensions. Burns was extremely critical of the leadership of China, saying: “China has a fearful leadership, fearful men trying to preserve their own power, increasing the grip that they have on their own citizens. Look what’s happening in Xinxiang and the Uyghurs, and in Hong Kong, just to give those examples.”He added, “And I actually think I’m hopeful about the future of India and the US. I worry the Chinese system is not going to be flexible enough to accommodate the desires of the Chinese people for human freedom and liberty. So I am a champion of democracy, as are you. I have confidence that democracies will survive these tests.”Burns served in the US government for 27 years and as a career foreign service officer, he was under secretary of state for political affairs during 2005-08, the state department’s third-ranking official when he led negotiations on the India-US civil nuclear agreement.The dialogue was part of Gandhi’s series of video conversations with global and Indian thought leaders on the Covid-19 crisis and its consequences on the Indian and global economy.In the past, the Congress leader has interacted with former Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Raghuram Rajan, Nobel Laureate Abhijit Banerjee, Harvard professor Ashish Jha, Swedish epidemiologist Johan Giesecke and Bajaj Auto managing director Rajiv Bajaj.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-has-fearful-leadership-lacks-openness-like-india-or-us-nicholas-burns/story-Nd0E31usEsgEIh0ukNNUaO.html

Force majeure refers to unexpected circumstances that prevent someone from fulfilling a contract.The duration of the force majeure will be excluded while calculating the delay in delivery of the contracted equipment or service and imposition of liquidated damages charges, the statement said.“This measure would bring a big relief to the domestic defence industry whose production schedules have been adversely affected by the Covid-19 situation,” a spokesperson said.Foreign vendors can approach the defence ministry directly, which may consider cases on the basis of the situation prevailing in their respective countries, he added.It couldn’t immediately be ascertained how many capital acquisition contracts would benefit from the order or the total quantum of equipment involved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-crisis-defence-ministry-gives-more-time-to-vendors-to-fulfil-contracts/story-xZLZBvx2Jq4y7MBpqud6ZN.html

12-06-2020||India||Without tiger population control, more captures expected: Top official||Authorities in Maharashtra fear there could be a sharp increase in instances of man-animal conflicts or wildlife officials being called in to capture tigers responsible for killing humans if steps aren’t taken to control the tiger population across central India.On Wednesday evening, a male tiger responsible for killing five people between February and June was captured by Maharashtra’s forest department from the buffer area of Tadoba-Andhari tiger reserve.Last month, another tiger from Brahmapuri was captured in Gondia, and the animal was said to have killed four people across the two forest divisions. An order has also been issued to capture another tiger in Rajura forest division that was allegedly responsible for four deaths.This year, 22 people have died in tiger attacks between January and June, higher than the figures for the same period of previous years, the forest department said. There were 26 deaths in 2019 and 25 in 2018.During 2015-19, Maharashtra topped the tally of human deaths in tiger attacks in India, with the most cases reported last year. The latest developments come against the backdrop of tigress Avni being shot dead in November 2018 in controversial circumstances.Nitin Kakodkar, the principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) of the state, said more incidents of tigers being captured or man-animal conflicts should be expected without population control measures in place across central Indian, especially Chandrapur district, home to more than 170 of Maharashtra’s 312 tigers.“With almost 54% of all tigers in Maharashtra located within one district, we are expecting an exponential increase in human-tiger conflict in the near future, forcing increased cases of tiger captures to avoid human deaths,” Kakodkar said.There are more than 200 tigers inside and outside protected areas in eastern Vidarbha, which has a forest cover of 22,508 sq km, or 37% of the total geographical area. The human population in this region is 14.5 million.The forest department has proposed the Maharashtra government should consider measures such as translocation of 50 tigers from the region to areas with fewer numbers, or to zoological parks or even states with low tiger populations, and sterilisation of male tigers to curb the population.“While these are suggestions at the moment, and yet to be sanctioned, there is a need for immediate solutions or at least discussions to review the expected surge in conflict. Our intent is to ensure tigers as a species are protected in this region, residents are not harmed, and our forest staff are safeguarded from any backlash from locals following conflict cases,” said Kakodkar. Forest minister Sanjay Rathod said the department was looking at habitat development in and around national parks, sanctuaries and protected areas in Maharashtra where tiger numbers are low.“We are facing an acute crisis in Chandrapur, where estimated numbers show that there could be over 500 tigers in the district within two years. Currently, there are about 15 tigers surrounding main Chandrapur city. We are anticipating an increase in conflict, and for this we have already begun reaching out to tiger scientists and independent experts for suggestions,” said Rathod.“My intent is to have more green spaces near existing sanctuaries or corridors, away from human settlements, where we increase prey base and natural resources for tigers to ensure they can safely disperse in such areas.”Rathod said a final list of suggestions will be collated in the form of a proposal to address the tiger conflict in Chandrapur. “This will be submitted to the chief minister, and with his approval sent to the Union environment ministry. The entire process is being expedited as cases are rising,” he said. The National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) said Chandrapur is emerging as a primary hotbed for man-animal conflicts.NTCA member secretary Anup Nayak said: “Translocation of a few tigers will be a temporary solution as other dominant ones will take over such areas very soon. As far as sterilisation is concerned, that is a major step and can have several adverse impacts. There is a serious problem in Chandrapur, but we need to have more deliberations before coming up with overall solutions.“For the time being, we need to be more assertive and ensure all our resources, including increased special tiger protection forces (STPF), are deployed for focused monitoring along with the forest department.”Experts said each case of conflict needs to be assessed in isolation, unless it has been proven the same tiger was involved in several attacks.Wildlife Conservation Trust president Anish Andheria said, “The mistake we make is to compile human-wildlife interaction cases, which are wrongly termed as conflict cases, over a 10-year period, which creates a false impression that large carnivores are bloodthirsty beasts.“By leaving out important information regarding man-made factors, such as forest degradation, fragmentation, forest fires and prey poaching, from the narrative, people get misled into believing tigers have become increasingly aggressive. In fact, the reasons for increased interactions are all man-made.“Owing to this incomplete information, wrong solutions are suggested and implemented. Instead of improving the quality of habitat, strengthening corridors, reducing livestock densities and suggesting behaviour changes in people, what is done on ground is removal of tigers.”Kishore Rithe, a former member of the state wildlife board, said while he opposed the move of capturing 50-odd tigers and sending them to zoos or sterilising males, he supported capturing problem tigers and sending them to enclosures.“I would go one step ahead – I feel that we should capture such tigers who show signs of becoming ‘problem animals’, and release them in nearby suitable habitats. That would save the lives of people and tigers both,” he said.According to the forest department, the male tiger (KT1) captured on Wednesday evening was responsible for kills on February 15, May 19, April 8, June 4 and June 6.“The first two kills were closer to the fringes of the core area of Tadoba-Andhari tiger reserve, while the remaining were in the buffer near Kolara and Bamangaon. However, all kills were made when local residents had entered forest to gather wood, mahua or tendu leaves,” said Kakodkar.“Thus, I issued orders for the tiger’s capture on Monday.”On Wednesday, a team of forest officers including a wildlife veterinary officer set up three live baits using cattle near a lake, Chaiti talao, near Kolara, located in the buffer of the tiger reserve, and waited atop machans for the tiger.The tiger killed one of the baits in the day and returned in the evening to eat it. “With all precautions in place, the wildlife veterinary officer shot the dart around 5 pm, tranquilising the animal before sunset,” said Kakodkar. “The animal was shifted to Gorewada zoo and wildlife rescue centre in Nagpur to be kept in captivity.”On May 7, a two-year-old tigress (N1), allegedly responsible for the death of two people in Gondia was tranquillised and captured by the forest department and sent to Gorewada zoo. After two reported kills by the animal in November and December last year, the tiger reportedly killed two people collecting forest produce in the last week of April and another on May 2.Andheria said research has shown that tigers generally do not get into conflict in the areas they live in. “Dispersed young animals, if at all, are relatively more prone to get involved in skirmishes with people. If a number of tigers have reached the ecological capacity of the habitat, young tigers will be moved out of that area. Conflict cannot increase exponentially in open habitats,” he said.“However, whenever a tiger is found to engage in repeated attacks, it needs to be moved into captivity…Problems being witnessed currently are a symptom of human-induced pressures. At the same time, management practices within core forest areas should not be replicated outside.”As the department searches for the tiger in Rajura, another order issued in January to capture another male tiger in Chandrapur division lapsed in April. The chief wildlife warden’s orders lapse after two months of being issued if they are not renewed.“While the order for trapping the Rajura tiger is in place, and the department is making progress, the Chandrapur tiger has not made any human kills or attacks in sometime, leading to a lapse in the trapping order.

It has been recording nearly 10,000 cases since June 2 and added nearly 90,000 or nearly one-third cases of its tally.It has left behind Italy and Spain, two of the countries badly hit by the highly contagious Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes Covid-19 and surfaced in China’s Wuhan late last year and became a global pandemic by March.Two months before that on March 25, when the national lockdown was declared, the country had a little over 500 cases and 10 people had died.India’s first Covid-19 case was detected more than four months ago on January 30 and it took more than 100 days to reach the one lakh-mark on May 18. However, the next one lakh cases were added in just about a fortnight.Globally, more than 7.5 million people have contracted Covid-19 and over 420,000 have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-over-2-9-lakh-covid-19-cases-india-is-now-the-fourth-worst-hit-country/story-IKQrzQeWFPrzen2ABHwC9I.html

Burns was speaking to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi via video-conferencing.“Our greatest American in the last 100 years is Martin Luther King Junior. He fought peaceful and non-violent battles. His spiritual idol was Mahatma Gandhi. King led us to become a better country. We elected an African-American President Barack Obama. And yet, you see race come back now. You see African-American mistreated,” said Burns.“It was horrible, horrible murder of George Floyd, a young African-American man by the police in Minneapolis. There are millions of Americans protesting peacefully as is our right. And yet, the President treats them like terrorists,” he added.“Countries sometimes have to go through a discussion, a political debate about who are we? At the core, what kind of nation are we? We are an immigrant nation, a tolerant nation,” said Burns.Floyd died after a police officer pressed his knee against his neck in Minneapolis on May 25. His last words “I can’t breathe” have been a rallying cry for the protesters who have launched demonstrations in various parts of the Unites States.The issue has also led to serious debate in the American society about race.Gandhi held a conversation with Burns on how coronavirus crisis was reshaping the world order. The interaction between also covered a wide range of issues, including racism in the United States.Burns is currently the Professor of Practice of Diplomacy and International Politics at Harvard’s John F Kennedy School of Government. At the Harvard Kennedy School, Burns is the Director of The Future of Diplomacy Project and Faculty Chair for the programs on the Middle East, India and South Asia.During his career in the State Department, he was United States Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs within the United States Department of State.

India has also climbed to the fourth spot in the list of nations worst hit by the coronavirus pandemic after the US, Brazil and Russia.After recording the first Covid-19 case on January 30, India now has 141,842 active cases and 147,194 people have recovered from the respiratory disease.Also read: Seven states see rapid increase in Covid-19 cases in 10 daysThe number of people who have been cured of Covid-19 has been on the rise and Friday was the third day that there were more recoveries than active cases.According to a study, only 0.73% of the over 26,000 people across 83 districts of India may have been exposed to the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 by the end of April.It points to the slow spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the country but also the fact that much of its population is not immune to a disease that still has no cure.However, only part of the findings of the survey have been released. A key part on the presence of antibodies in so-called hotspots or containment zones, areas most affected by the disease, is awaited.Blood samples were taken in May from 26,400 individuals in 28,595 households across 83 districts in 21 states and tested for IgG antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus, and, therefore, also immunity, according to a few scientists.Also read: These 69 districts have fatality rate much higher than national averageThe number of cases and deaths per lakh population in India is also lowest in the world, with 20.77 cases as compared to 91.67 cases globally, and 0.59 deaths in India as opposed to 5.23 deaths in the world.Covid-19 has affected more than 7.5 million and killed 420,993 people across the world, according to America’s Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-956-new-covid-19-cases-396-deaths-in-biggest-single-day-spike/story-efVVODRaKKayBOCmdglMnJ.html

12-06-2020||India||On Madhya Pradesh Congress’ ‘shameful’ jibe on women officers at liquor shops, BJP hits back||The Madhya Pradesh Congress on Thursday accused the BJP government in the state of insulting women by engaging them in the sale of liquor.State Congress president Kamal Nath’s attack on the government came after a photo showing a woman employee of the excise department sitting in a liquor shop emerged on social media.The state government decided on Tuesday to run about 70 per cent liquor shops in the state, licences of which were surrendered by contractors amid ongoing tussle and legal battle with the government.The contractors took the step as the state government refused to concede to their demands for a reduced licence fee for the current financial year in view of the Covid-19 situation, leading to closure of shops for about two months and reduced sale even after opening of shops.“Shivraj ji, when you were in Opposition you used to protest on the issue of liquor, make speeches and stage sit-ins along with women while terming liquor as a threat to sisters and daughters. But now you yourself have made women to sit at liquor shops. What can be more shameful and double standard than this?” Kamal Nath said in his tweet posted in Hindi on Thursday. शिवराज जी आप जब विपक्ष में थे तो प्रदेश में शराब को लेकर खूब विरोध करते थे,खूब भाषण देते थे,शराब को बहन - बेटियों के लिये ख़तरा बताते हुए उनको साथ लेकर धरने पर बैठते थे।अब तो आपने बहन- बेटियों को ही शराब की दुकानो पर बैठा दिया?इससे शर्मनाक व दोहरा चरित्र कुछ नहीं हो सकता है ? pic.twitter.com/TXh41mVd7bState BJP leader Dr Hitesh Bajpai said, “The Congress leaders are not able to understand that there is a difference between a woman employee selling liquor and a woman employee supervising the sale as per her duty in the department. Did Congress leaders try to know who of the women employees are discharging what duties?”Excise commissioner Rajiv Chandra Dubey said, “Largely women employees of the department have been kept away from sale of liquor. They are mainly engaged in the role of supervision. But there might have been some aberrations due to staff constraints.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-madhya-pradesh-congress-shameful-jibe-on-women-officers-at-liquor-shops-bjp-hits-back/story-twQJC8DGiiGn7tH3D5LpHP.html
12-06-2020||India||These 69 districts have fatality rate much higher than national average||Sixty-nine districts in 13 states with the case fatality rate (CFR) of 5% or more against the national CFR of 2.90% of the total number of Covid-19 cases since May 18 have emerged as “issue of concern” for the Centre.CFR is the proportion of incident patients dying because of the disease or injury in a certain time window, which in India is lower than in several western countries.“The case fatality rate has remained flat at 2.90% as compared to 2.96% on May 18,” cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba said while giving a detailed presentation on the overall status of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India as on June 9.The number of Covid-19 cases increased from 100,800 on May 18 to 287,155 on June 10 and the number of deaths jumped from 3,156 to 8,108 in this period.Gauba said that 82% of all the deaths have been reported from five states—Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh—which also have high Covid-19 caseload, though most of the deaths have occurred because of co-morbidities among the patients.He also highlighted that 69 districts in the country reported more than 5% of the case fatality rate. The highest number of districts were in Madhya Pradesh (21), followed by Uttar Pradesh (11), Gujarat (9), Rajasthan (5) and Telangana (3).Here’s a list of the districts with high Covid-19 fatality rate:Madhya Pradesh: Mandi, Sehore, Umaria, Mandsaur, Rajgarh, Satna, Ujjain, Hoshangabad, Burhan, Khargone, Sagar, Dewas, East Nimar (Khandwa), Shajapur, Ratlam Chhindwara, Datia, Rajgarh, Tikamgarh, Agar Malwa, JhabuaUttar Pradesh: Lalitpur, Jhansi, Meerut, Agra, Aligarh, Gorakhpur, Firozabad, Mathura, Etah, Jalaun, MahobaMaharashtra: Washim, Nandurbar, Jalgaon, Dhule, Solapur, Aurangabad, Nashik, Satara, Amravati, WardhaGujarat: Porbandar, Panch Mahal, Anand, Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar, Patna, Rajendra Nagar, Kutch, BharuchRajasthan: Karauli, Sawai Madhopur, Pratapgarh, Jaipur, BaranTelangana: Narayanpur, Mancherial, NirmalHimachal Pradesh: Mandi, ShimlaWest Bengal: Kolkata, 24 Parganas NorthDelhi: Shahdara, North-East DelhiHaryana: JindKarnataka: TumkuruPunjab: KapurthalaChhattisgarh: Bastar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/these-69-districts-have-fatality-rate-much-higher-than-national-average/story-5LgQthgLCGHrsiTTtvBAuI.html
12-06-2020||India||Covid-19: 46 districts in 13 states have higher confirmation rate than national average||India has seen improvements in the coronavirus disease scenario in the months since the outbreak was reported. But there are some districts which are areas of concern, the Centre has said.These 46 districts have a Covid-19 confirmation rate (positives for total Covid-19 tests done) of more than 10% as compared to 5.70% national rate. They were identified in a meeting held by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba with states on Wednesday.Gauba also gave a detailed presentation in the meeting on the overall Covid-19 status in India as on June 9 and the challenges that have emerged since the government eased lockdown restrictions.He said that the highest number of these districts (12) are in Maharashtra, which is the worst-affected state due to the Covid-19 pandemic. These districts are: Mumbai, Thane, Palghar, Aurangabad, Raigad, Pune, Solapur, Nashik, Akola, Osmanabad, Gondia and Jalgaon.In Delhi, nine out of 11 districts have a higher confirmation rate, the presentation said. These are North-West, Central, South-East, East, West, North, Shahdara, South-West and North-East.Telangana has four districts namely Medchal Malkajgiri, Hyderabad, Rangareddy, and Suryapet. In Tamil Nadu, Chennai, Chengalpattu, Thiruvallur, Ariyalur have a higher confirmation rate.Similarly, Khgaria, Purbi Champran, Sitamarhi, Muzaffarpur in Bihar; Khargone, Burhanpur, Neemuch in Madhya Pradesh; Firozabad, Chitrakoot in UP; Hojai and Dima Hasao in Assam; Ahmedabad and Vadodara in Gujarat; Sepahijala in Tripura; Tehri Garhwal in Uttarakhand; Howrad and West Bengal and Pali in Rajasthan are the other districts where the Covid-19 confirmation rate is higher than the national average.“The increase in confirmation rate (between May 18 and June 9) indicates at either increase in spread of coronavirus or lower testing during this period,” the presentation said.The presentation also pointed out that there was a huge turnaround time for getting test results in several districts, especially in the rural areas. HT had reported that Jharkhand and Bihar were taking up to 14 days to provide results of the tests taken at the quarantine centers. “The delay is because of the sudden increase in the swabs being taken,” said Jharkhand health secretary Nitin Kulkarni. Bihar health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh said the pendency of the tests results is reducing as swabs of most of the symptomatic persons in quarantine centers have been taken.On the positive side, the Cabinet Secretary said that the doubling rate has increased to 16.9 days from earlier 14.1 days and the national fatality rate was still below 3%. He also said that the spread of Covid-19 cases to newer districts was not very high and the situation there was under control. Gauba said that several districts have reported slowing down of Covid-19 cases, which indicated that the lockdown had a positive impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-46-districts-in-13-states-have-higher-confirmation-rate-than-national-average/story-lAYgcXRdbwGYFTR3LjQ2VM.html

12-06-2020||India||‘Aggressively carry out core health measures’, says WHO South-East Asia director||World Health Organisation (WHO)’s regional director (South-East Asia) Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh says there is no difference in the protection medical masks and N95 respirators offer. She says scientific evidence shows both result in large reduction in the spread of Covid-19. In an interview to Sanchita Sharma, Singh also spoke about the need for the general population to wear fabric or medical masks in public places. Edited excerpts:What is better? N95 respirator or surgical mask?Randomised controlled trials do not show any difference between medical/surgical masks and N95 respirators in reducing the transmission of airborne infections. Some observational studies also show both medical masks and N95 result in large reductions in the transmission of coronavirus.WHO recommends health care workers use N95 masks and other protection when conducting aerosol-generating procedures or in settings where these procedures are occurring. It is usually in health care settings, for example, when a health worker is intubating a patient.What is the evidence regarding the protection provided by masks?Masks are a part of a comprehensive package of measures to suppress transmission and save lives. The use of a mask alone is insufficient to provide an adequate level of protection.What kind of mask should the general public wear?The general public is advised to wear non-medical, fabric masks where there is a widespread transmission and limited capacity to implement control measures, such as case-finding and contact tracing. Wearing masks is important where physical distancing is not possible, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments.Following WHO research and development meeting in February, a research group was requested to conduct a study on masks. The study identified preferable types of fabrics, the number of layers, and the composition of a non-medical mask. It should include an inner layer of absorbent material such as cotton, a middle layer of non-woven material such as polypropylene, and an outer layer of a non-absorbent material such as polyester or polyester blend. The mask should allow you to breathe while talking and walking briskly.With cases rising, what actions are needed to prevent a surge?The transmissibility and severity of Covid-19 have not changed. ...Severity also remains consistent. We know that the virus causes a range of illnesses, with a majority of people having experienced mild symptoms and 20% a more severe disease. As the transmission of Covid-19 is not typically homogenous within the country, a national risk assessment should be supported and implemented through sub-national or even community-level risk assessment. We need to aggressively implement core public health measures - detect and test, isolate and treat, and trace contacts, promote safe hygiene practices and respiratory etiquette, protect health workers, and increase health system capacity. This is a pandemic. It needs a whole-of-society approach. Our fight against Covid-19 is far from over. The world is still facing a big wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.Do lockdowns work if infection rates are high?Lockdowns have multiple objectives as public health measures for social distancing, to slow down the virus transmission, and to allow the healthcare systems enough time to strengthen infrastructure and capacities. The cornerstone of the response in any transmission scenario continues to be to find, isolate, test and care, and to trace and quarantine contacts.Is more testing needed to diagnose and isolate?Testing is an important component of surveillance and guides contract tracing, isolation, and treatment. It also shows where response efforts need to be directed to combat the disease. India has been calibrating its testing strategy as per the changing situation, taking into account scope, need, and capacity. With increased testing, the trajectory of positive cases will go up. But it will also help in better preparedness and response.What is the role of antibody tests?The PCR-based tests are better for telling whether you are infected or not and the serology, or the blood test, is better to detect whether you have been infected recently or in the past.Tests to detect antibody responses to Covid-19 in the population will be critical to support the development of vaccines. Based on current data, WHO does not recommend the use of antibody-detecting rapid diagnostic tests for patient care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aggressively-carry-out-core-health-measures-says-who-south-east-asia-director/story-7UGHUTdKLpS5Bzx7nPfIyI.html
12-06-2020||India||Assam gas well blaze endangered wetlands, several species: Survey||The gas well blowout in Assam’s Tinsukia district has polluted the Lohit river and adjoining eco-sensitive Maguri-Motapung wetland and toxic pollutants may have killed fish, insects as well as pose risk to endangered Gangetic dolphins in the region, a preliminary Wildlife Institute of India (WII) survey report has said. It has cited interviews with locals and said the Oil India Limited (OIL) did not have a mitigation plan for such accidents. WII has hence suggested a comprehensive impact assessment of entire OIL field operations in the biodiversity-rich area. The well caught fire on Tuesday days after the blowout, or leakage of gas and condensate, began on May 27. Dibru-Saikhowa Biosphere Reserve (DSBR) located nearby is home to endangered hoolock gibbons.The Union environment ministry gave the environmental clearance to OIL on May 11 for extension drilling and testing of hydrocarbons at seven locations under Dibru Saikhowa National Park. The report said the fumes and oil coating has affected flora and fauna.“The contaminants and oil are continuing to be released in surrounding areas and immediate steps are needed to contain this spillover. The toxins released are known to have long-term persistence in soils and sediments, which will not only affect current life conditions but due to sustained release over a long period, pose a serious health risk for a longer-term,” said the report, a copy of which HT has seen, submitted to the ministry.WII scientist Qamar Qureshi said the region’s lowland forests are unique and they have found other wells are also leaking which can have long term impacts. “We have recommended a thorough assessment of disaster mitigation possibilities before implementing any more exploration projects,” he said.Soumitra Dasgupta, additional director-general (wildlife), environment ministry, said the wetland is affected and so are the aquatic species.“The national park is slightly away from the accident site. We will wait for the detailed WII study and response from the Assam forest department. We have written to them.”An OIL spokesperson did not comment on the report saying they are unaware of it. “Whatever condensed oil had been released earlier has been burnt off. There is no contamination from it anymore. We are trying to contain the gas which is releasing within four weeks.”WII, which carried the survey from May 29 to June 4, has recommended that the approved new wells and further exploration in the area be put on hold until OIL has disaster handling capabilities. It found the presence of at least five Gangetic dolphins in the 20 km stretch of the Lohit river it surveyed and indicated that they will be at grave risk from the ongoing spill.The team has collected samples of tissue and blubber from a dolphin carcass, which is being analysed for the presence of various contaminants. WII said new wells and explorations in this area should be initiated only after a thorough evaluation.It will come out with a detailed report on the impact on the region’s biodiversity by the month-end. WII has also flagged the long term environmental impacts of the spill as a blowout spews hundreds of chemicals in the air, water, and soil.Residents of the area reported severe breathing difficulty, headaches, and nausea to WII. Even the WII survey team experienced similar symptoms due to the heavy presence of oil. The entire landscape, including the wetland, is coated in layers of oil, WII said.The biodiversity-rich area is one of the important remaining habitats of several endangered and range-restricted species, according to WII. DSBR is also home to tigers, elephants, wild buffalos, leopards, capped langurs, slow loris, as well as critically endangered bird species such as the Bengal florican, white-winged wood duck, greater adjutant stork, white-rumped vulture, slender-billed vulture. The rare and endemic black-breasted parrotbill is found there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-gas-well-blaze-endangered-wetlands-several-species-survey/story-FdodXVaGmoMKD7swakjOvL.html

It may “compound the situation of unrest and instigate festering emotions in the erstwhile Jammu & Kashmir state, in addition to having international ramifications”, it said while rejecting the plea.CIC said “disclosure of the operational details will adversely impact security and strategic preparedness of the armed forces”. HT has seen a copy of the order.Of the 50 requests from the then state government for prosecuting the personnel, 47 were denied, according to the Centre’s response to a question tabled in Rajya Sabha in 2018.Venkatesh Nayak, programme head at the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative (an NGO) and a RTI activist, who sought the info in February 2018, said he took the matter to CIC after defence ministry and army refused details.CIC has directed the ministry to provide an affidavit to Nayak saying there are “no official records containing details of procedure or norms, criteria and standard that is to be followed by the Ministry while deciding the evidence submitted by the government of J&K government in prosecution sanction cases”.It asked the ministry to submit in writing it is the competent authority to sanction or deny permission to prosecute accused army personnel.CIC said the request for details have to be weighed on the scale of relativity of larger good between alleged victims and that of the state. Lawyer Navdeep Singh, a former reservist, said the decision on whether to prosecute or not will vary. “So, it is not surprising that there is no singular procedure,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/info-on-casualties-involving-army-in-j-k-adverse-for-ops-says-cic/story-jylG5vZ9h5wtHAas6ZtisL.html
12-06-2020||India||India side-steps issues in Nepal border row||The external affairs ministry on Thursday side-stepped issues that have complicated a border row with Nepal, holding up the importance of long-standing bilateral relations and ongoing cooperation amid the Covid-19 crisis.The move was perceived in diplomatic circles as an effort to dial down tensions that have spiralled in recent days, after the KP Sharma Oli government in Kathmandu tabled a constitutional amendment in Parliament to give legal backing to a political map that depicts the regions of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as Nepalese territory.Asked at a weekly news briefing why India hadn’t responded to Nepal’s overtures for talks on the border dispute and Oli’s criticism of “threatening” remarks by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said: “We have already made our position clear on these issues.”India, Srivastava added, deeply values its ties with Nepal. “India has been reaching out to friendly neighbouring countries, including Nepal, in line with the prime minister’s initiative to chart out a common strategy to combat Covid in the region.”Srivastava said India had supplied 25 tonnes of medical aid to Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-side-steps-issues-in-nepal-border-row/story-VTzleZuLH7i15GD6Lspu7L.html
12-06-2020||India||Palghar lynching: Supreme Court seeks response from Maharashtra, Centre||The Supreme Court on Thursday sought responses of the Centre and Maharashtra government to separate petitions seeking a probe by central agencies into the April 16 lynching of three people, including two Sadhus, in Palghar while questioning the state police’s conduct and alleging bias in their investigations.The kin of the two and six members of Panch Dashnam Juna Akhara, whom the sadhus were affiliated to, have sought a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the killings. One Ghanshyam Upadhyay has filed a separate plea seeing a National Investigation Agency (NIA) investigation. The petitions were tagged with that of lawyer Shashak Shekhar Jha, who moved the court in April seeking a CBI or judicial probe into the incident. “Issue notice returnable in the second week of July 2020,” a justice Ashok Bhushan-led bench said. The bench, also comprising justices M R Shah and V Ramasubramanian, posted these matters for further hearing in the second week of July.A mob of villagers lynched Kalpavruksha Giri, Sushil Giri, and their driver, Neelesh Telgade. The crowd suspected them of being child-lifters, dragged them out, and beat them with sticks. The three from Kandivali in Mumbai were on their way to a funeral at Surat in Gujarat amid the Covid-19 lockdown when their car was stopped and they were attacked in the presence of police, who have maintained they were outnumbered. A video of the incident triggered outrage and a war of words between the ruling Shiv Sena-led alliance and the opposition BJP.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on April 20 set up a high-level police probe, suspension of police personnel for dereliction of duty and the arrest of over 100 accused. He warned against giving the incident a communal colour.The petition that has sought the CBI probe accused police of inaction. “The entire incident and its handling raise several questions which remain unanswered till date and as the petitioners apprehend shall never be answered unless they are investigated by an independent, unsullen and reputed arm of the central agencies,” it said.“Several video clippings have emerged on social media and news reports which very clearly demonstrate the active involvement of the police present, who can be seen handing over the three persons to the unlawful assembly of persons gathered.”It said the totality of the circumstances raises serious and unanswered questions about the state police’s ability to independently investigate into the incident “considering the potential involvement of the police in the gruesome lynching”. Maharashtra government’s lawyers opposed the petitions and said similar pleas are pending before the Bombay high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/palghar-lynching-supreme-court-seeks-response-from-maharashtra-centre/story-NLbkhcgLO2nuSxbhJREHpL.html
12-06-2020||India||‘Govt’s focus is on giving services to those in need’, says BJP’s Bhupender Yadav||Assembly elections in Bihar are due later this year.Bhupender Yadav, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in-charge for the state Bihar, spoke to Smriti Kak Ramachandran about the polls, anti-incumbency, migrant workers, etc. Edited excerpts:What are the challenges the party is facing apart from its inability to hold rallies amid the pandemic?After five years, every party has to be ready to face elections. The situation we are facing is a challenge not just for the country but for the entire humankind. The government has dealt with the situation effectively and systematically. There was an implementation of four successful lockdowns and a gradual unlocking.If unlocking proceeds smoothly, then elections in Bihar will also be conducted. ...digital [technologies]... and social media play a crucial role, but at the same time, personal contact, humanitarian approach, ground-level work, and booth level activity cannot be ignored. All these factors will continue to be important during electioneering.There is a perception that Bihar’s delayed response to bringing migrant workers home will impact the elections. This will be a challenge in addition to factors such as anti-incumbency...It is an incorrect perception. During the first three phases of the lockdown, no movement was allowed because preparedness was necessary to fight the pandemic. The government worked with awareness and preparedness. We cannot say there was a delay. Till today, 1,058 trains have carried 2.1 million passengers home. In addition to this, the Bihar government pressed 4,500 buses into service and ran 26 trains for the workers. The response of the railway ministry and the Bihar government has been one of synergy.Whether it was setting up quarantine centres, providing ration, offering social security through schemes, the government has taken care of the needy. The marginalised sections have seen the impact on the ground of the services provided. And in Bihar, there is proof of development.The state government is carrying out a skill mapping exercise, which has shown a bulk of returnees are construction workers. How will the government offer jobs to workers will limited skill sets?The government has doubled the allocation for MNREGS [Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme] and also increased the workdays. There are many challenges. Yet there are roads and power everywhere. Employment avenues will be created in the agricultural sector even though Bihar is already quite ahead in agricultural production. There are state-specific provisions in the Atmanirbhar Bharat package [to deal with the pandemic]...The opposition feels the government is more focused on holding elections rather than on fighting the pandemic...It is incorrect to say the government is focusing only on the election. It has focused on offering services to those in need. The demand and supply of ration, for instance, have been met everywhere. Some people think only tweeting is politics. We don’t think so. Those opposing and criticising us were not even present in Bihar during the pandemic. Their criticism does not cut ice with people because they were absent.Covid-19 has exposed shortcomings in the health infrastructure. Do you think this will become a poll issue in a state?The government has done a lot of work to ramp up the health infrastructure and even during the lockdown to prevent the spread of the virus, a fund was created. Just as for polio eradication, a door-to-door campaign was conducted, a similar exercise will be carried out for mapping corona cases.Health workers are also being empowered and offered protection. And all this is being done for everyone and it is not caste-specific. Our party does not subscribe to the politics of caste conflict. We believe in the politics of coordination and cooperation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-s-focus-is-on-giving-services-to-those-in-need-says-bihar-bjp-s-bhupender-yadav/story-l7pcsXQYjdhA9tKYKZix0N.html
12-06-2020||India||Covid-19 pandemic forces hospitals to scale up||“Somebody help me. I need a corona bed for my father,” said Ajai Kumar, carrying his sick father who was gasping for breath into the emergency ward of Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital in the Walled City of Delhi after being turned away by two private hospitals.That was last Friday (June 5).Sudama Kumar, a 63-year-old retired official of the Central Public Works Department had developed fever the week before, but when it progressed to breathlessness, his son took him to Max hospital, Patparganj on June 3, fearing it might be the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).“He was so sick that he fell off the chair and collapsed in a heap on the floor [but] the hospital turned us away without testing him because they had no free beds for Covid or suspected Covid patients,” said Kumar, whose father is a beneficiary of the Central Government Health Scheme, a health care facility scheme for current and former employees of the central government.When asked to verify Kumar’s account, Max Hospitals declined to comment.“I next took him to a small nursing home, which got the test done but asked us to leave after he tested positive because the clinic did not treat Covid patients,” said Kumar. Finally, Sudama Kumar received a bed in the Delhi government-run LNJP.With the number of cases rising every day, the strain on the health care infrastructure of metropolises like Delhi and Mumbai has begun to show. In the past two months, several people took to social media to express their dismay at being unable to find hospital beds or proper treatment for their family members and friends.During a recent press conference, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that Delhi will require 80,000 hospital beds by the end of July; based on the infection’s current doubling rate of 12.6 days, by July 31, the number of cases in Delhi will reach 550,000.Mumbai was only testing 4000 samples daily at the beginning of this month; its testing capacity is 7000 tests a day.Hospitals, particularly those designated in various states as Covid-19 treatment hospitals, have been forced to adapt using limited infrastructure, space and human resources. Early in the pandemic itself, healthy patients were segregated from suspected and Covid-positive patients; the focus shifted to critical care treatment; hospitals staggered timings of staff to decongest the wards, and scaled up e-consultations and remote management of chronic conditions like diabetes and heart disease. As early as March, hospitals like the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in New Delhi began to postpone elective surgeries to free up hospital staff for Covid care.Experts said that managing a pandemic will leave hospitals with some important lessons.“Measures taken now will help reduce the overload on the tertiary and secondary hospitals and improve documentation, data-collection, diagnosis and care without risking the safety of the patients or the health workers. For patients already under treatment, reports can be viewed online and prescriptions made accordingly. Patients will need to come to tertiary care hospitals outpatient clinics only if the treatment needs an overhaul or if they need surgery or invasive treatments, like radiation,” said Dr Nikhil Tandon, professor and head of the department of endocrinology and metabolism, AIIMS, Delhi. He is a member of the board of governors in supersession of the Medical Council of India that drafted the brand new Telemedicine Practice Guidelines notified in May.Telemedicine has already helped decongest AIIMS Delhi, which moved its out-patient department services online from April 8 to follow up with the around 60,000 patients registered for treatment during the lockdown.This is continuing post the lockdown at AIIMS, which is arguably one of the world’s busiest hospitals with a daily footfall of 15,000 (3.5 million patients in the outpatient clinics, 200,000 in the in-patient department) and 170,000 surgeries in pre-pandemic times. Around half of these patients are from other states. Telemedicine may well emerge as the most transformative change to provide health care.“Leveraging India’s IT strength and increasing investment in telemedicine to shift from human resource-intensive care to meet shortfall to a great extent, especially of super-specialists. Start-ups are doing it already, we have e-ICUs and home-isolation support remote-managed from hundreds of kilometres away,” said C K Mishra, former health secretary and mission director of National Health Mission.Do more with lessWith Covid-19 spreading , India was forced to rapidly scale up its critical care infrastructure after seven decades during which much of public health budgets went to programmes on maternal and child health. It did that, and with some measure of success.Several thousands with severe disease were treated, which would not have been possible a couple of months ago. As of June 11, 141,028 people are reportedly cured of Covid-19 in India, which translates into a recovery rate of 49.21%. For the first time since the pandemic began, the number of those recovered has overtaken the number of those who are currently infected.On March 30, four weeks after the first two Covid-19 cases in Delhi and Hyderabad (on March 2), there were just 32,000 ventilators for all diseases across all states in public and private hospitals, according to an internal assessment report of the ministry of health.According to the Association of Indian Medical Device Industry, a private industry body, the manufacturing capacity for ventilators alone has increased from 3,000 a month in February to 33,000 a month in May.By June 9, centre and states have designated 958 Covid hospitals across the country, as well as 2,313 Covid Health Centres (for those who don’t need too much medical support) and 7,525 Covid Care Centres (for those with mild infections who can’t isolate themselves at home).That’s only a start.“A few thousand ventilator beds are not enough for India’s 1.35 billion population. It’s certainly not enough for when cases peak in July and August. It’s a jump-start, but we need to sustain it and [have] a lot more testing, a lot more beds, far more hospitals to make up for decades of neglect of public health,” said Dr Jacob John, former head of the department of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu.In two short months, India has had to upgrade its flailing infrastructure and create a contingency plan for large-scale medical emergencies. This, despite public health expenditure hovering at just around 1.28% of its Gross Domestic Product.“Many countries are learning that you cannot build health care capacity during a crisis. It takes time and investment to build a good public health system. India has failed to invest in health for decades and this must change post-Covid19. Health spend must at least increase to 2.5% of GDP, at a minimum,” said Prof Madhukar Pai, director, McGill Global Health Programs, McGill University, Montreal, Canada.As part of the stimulus package finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced in May, Rs 15,000 crore has been earmarked to strengthen public health infrastructure, down to the block level. India has 7,096 of them.“Each city and district has to develop its own programme because there is a difference between metros and other cities, and between towns and rural India,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, professor and head of pulmonology and director, AIIMS Delhi.Made in IndiaWith roughly 10% of all Covid-19 infections in India found in hospital employees – in March and April, hospitals around the country became hot spots and were shut down – the focus shifted early on to procuring protective personal equipment kits (PPEs). After an early consignment of 1.7 lakh imported kits from China were found to be faulty, domestic production was ramped up. By mid-April, the Bureau of Indian Standards came up with stringent measures.Now, domestic manufacturers provide medical devices, protective gear, diagnostics, hospital equipment, and telemedicine services. As of Tuesday, the Centre had provided 12.84 million N-95 masks and 10.47 million PPE kits to states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-pandemic-forces-hospitals-to-scale-up/story-7iRDBFUC4V5Xk9SgNA6fxM.html
12-06-2020||India||Wary of defections, Congress moves Rajasthan MLAs to resort before Rajya Sabha polls||Wary of defections ahead of the June 19 Rajya Sabha elections, the ruling Congress in Rajasthan shifted all its legislators to a resort in Jaipur to prevent them from jumping ship or being poached.The Congress lost power in Madhya Pradesh in March and is on the verge of losing a Rajya Sabha seat in Gujarat due to resignations by its legislators. A similar situation also resulted in the collapse of the Janata Dal (Secular)-Congress coalition in Karnataka. The Congress has blamed the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for these desertions and the fall of its governments.In the 200-member Rajasthan assembly, the Congress has 107 legislators and also claims to have the support of 13 independents, two legislators each from the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and the Bharatiya Tribal Party (BTP) as also one member of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD).The BJP has 72 legislators and is supported by the Rashtriya Loktantrk Party (RLP) that has three members in the assembly.Three Rajya Sabha seats in Rajasthan are going to polls on June 19. The Congress has fielded party general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal and state office bearer Neeraj Dangi while the BJP has named Rajendra Gehlot and Omkar Singh Lakhawat as its candidates. After three of its legislators resigned from the party and the Gujarat assembly last week, the Congress swung into action and shifted its 21 lawmakers to a resort in Abu Road, Jaipur.Rajasthan Congress leaders alleged that attempts are being made by the BJP to lure legislators with huge financial inducements, a charge vehemently denied by the BJP.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot too claimed lots of money has changed hands in Jaipur and said there were reports that the BJP was planning a Madhya Pradesh-like operation in his state.“Our legislators are intelligent, alert and united. Rajasthan is the only state in the country where 13 independents supported our government neither for any exchange of money nor any post,” he told reporters in Jaipur.In late March, five Congress legislators in Gujarat quit the party and the assembly ahead of the Rajya Sabha elections then scheduled for March 26. However, the polls were deferred due to the coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown.Three more Congress legislators resigned last week, bringing the party’s strength down to 65 in the 182-member Gujarat assembly. The ruling BJP has 103 legislators. With 10 vacancies in all -- eight because of resignations by Congress legislators, and two due to court cases over poll-related disputes -- the effective strength of the Gujarat assembly now stands at 172. A candidate will have to get 35 votes to get elected to the Upper House of Parliament and polls will be held for four Rajya Sabha seats from the state.The BJP has fielded Abhay Bhardwaj, Ramilaben Bara and Narhari Amin while Bharatsinh Solanki and Shaktisinh Gohil are the Congress candidates.On Wednesday, Gehlot summoned his legislators for an emergency meeting at a Jaipur resort . They were asked to stay there but some left after attending the meeting; they returned on Thursday for another round of consultations.The party has given time till Friday for all its legislators to move to the resort.The Rajasthan government’s chief whip Mahesh Joshi, in a complaint to the director-general, anti-corruption bureau (ACB), alleged that there were attempts to poach Congress legislators as well as some supporting independent lawmakers.But leader of the opposition Gulab Chand Kataria dismissed allegations that the BJP was making any attempt to overthrow the Congress government in Rajasthan. He questioned why the Congress was lodging its legislators in a resort when it is running the government in the state and has support of independents.“This shows that they have differences within the party and to stop that they have been camping in a resort and blaming the BJP. Who are they complaining to? It is their government in the state. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wary-of-defections-congress-moves-rajasthan-mlas-to-resort-before-rajya-sabha-polls/story-Ja6f81dd0GanX8Ggt5bUpM.html
12-06-2020||India||Tamil Nadu sets up panel to probe ‘unaccounted’ Covid-19 fatalities||Tamil Nadu’s low mortality rate has come under scrutiny, with the state government setting up a committee to probe unaccounted Covid-19 deaths in Chennai. The Directorate of Public Health (DPH) and Preventive Medicine found that the death registry maintained by the Greater Chennai Corporation recorded 236 deaths that were not added to the state’s tally. DPH has now formed a nine-member committee to reconcile Covid-19 related deaths for Chennai. “We are yet to see the data from the corporation which will help us get to the bottom of the problem,” says Dr P Vadivelan who is heading the committee which will soon discuss the matter with officials of corporation, public health and Directorate of Medical Education. “We suspect that many of these deaths happened at home so they may have received tests late and reported late.” Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami told reporters on Thursday: “We don’t hide the number of deaths, we won’t gain anything if we do that.”Newspapers on Thursday reported that some Covid deaths are not reflecting in the state tally as per the daily data released by DPH and department of the health and family welfare in Tamil Nadu. As of June 8, this bulletin reported that Chennai accounted for 224 out of the 286 deaths in Tamil Nadu. When DPH officials found an additional 236 more deaths in Chennai’s city corporation, a revision exercise was ordered to reconcile the data. “We are conducting an analysis of our line list of all the positive patients in the state which should give us a clear picture,” says Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner G Prakash. Director of Public Health Dr TS Selvavinayagam has asked the civic body to share data from March and for all deaths to be reported on a daily basis. “Reconciliation is an approved administrative mechanism. The aim is to rectify the registry by understanding why, when and how the numbers are reported as two-three departments are involved,” says Selvavinayagam. A senior official of the corporation said on condition of anonymity that “ the audit can go through these cases and if it is due to Covid-19, there is no shame in adding those figures.”On the same day that the mismatch came to light, a Chennai-based anti-corruption group, Arappor Iyakkam, sent a report to health secretary Beela Rajesh challenging underreporting of Covid-19 death cases. It released two mortuary cards from the Government Stanley Medical College Hospital in Chennai that were marked ‘Covid-19 positive’ and complained the cases did not reflect in the state tally. “Whistleblowers have been sending us such cases to be exposed,” said Jayaram Venkatesan, founder, Arappor Iyakkam. “The argument that there is miscommunication falls flat because we have exposed cases in government hospitals which also needs to be investigated.” Officials say that hospitals must inform both the corporation and DPH of Covid-19 deaths but only few are reporting to the corporation (via local authorities such as sanitary inspectors and zonal officers) which, in turn, has not updated the DPH. “In other districts in Tamil Nadu, we have a deputy director of health service who coordinates at the block or municipality level and reports to the DPH. That mechanism is missing in Chennai,” said a former health official who asked not to be named. The state health department said 1,875 persons tested positive, while 22 succumbed to the virus. The capital Chennai recorded more than 1,400 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-sets-up-panel-to-probe-unaccounted-covid-19-fatalities/story-NcKLoUcf8tRULIJaKEgZMN.html
12-06-2020||India||Railways mulls generating jobs under NREGS||The ministry of railways is considering generating employment under the government’s flagship rural job guarantee scheme, a move aimed at helping migrants who have returned home in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to slow its spread.The idea was proposed at high-level meeting held by Union railway minister Piyush Goyal on Tuesday with senior ministry officials , according to officials aware of the development. The Indian Railways may generate employment for the migrants by tapping resources under the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme for minor construction work. The national carrier mostly employs skilled labourers though private contractors for its construction work but the meeting discussed the use of workers under MGNREGA “instead of private labour and contractors for minor construction work usually in and around stations,” a senior railway official said, asking not to be named. The rail ministry has asked railway zones to get in touch with district collectors across states to get an estimate of the workforce and demand for work in rural areas. The ministry’s move comes even as both the Centre and the states have begun the process of undertaking a comprehensive skill mapping exercise of migrant workers as part of an attempt to find them work closer home. “ NREGA work seekers are daily wage workers. The plan is to discourage distress migration. It will be tough to bring them to urban areas where railway work is usually done... but through this scheme railways can provide employment in rural areas for minor work such as building boundary walls around stations, etc,” the railway official added.This won’t be the first time Railways is using the scheme. In 2015, it looked at potential work that could be taken up under MGNREGA. The areas identified included “construction and maintenance of approach roads for level crossings; developing and cleaning silted waterways and drains along the tracks...” a second official said.“Railways should look at employing as many labourers whenever they can...because even though they focus on skilled construction work they will have a requirement for manual work as well where these labourers can be used,” said Jawaharlal Nehru University associate professor Himanshu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-mulls-generating-jobs-under-nregs/story-JSit4XYOn6r79gp3pbd6vM.html
12-06-2020||India||Use mobile data to keep tabs on home quarantine patients: Govt||The Centre on Thursday asked states to use technology like mobile phone tracking to keep a tab on people under home quarantine after the issue of difficulties in tracking such people was raised at a meeting Union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba chaired with representatives of the state governments, officials said.Issues like exorbitant fee charged by private hospitals to treat Covid-19 patients when government hospital beds are scarce were also discussed. Central government officials pointed out that Tamil Nadu and Karnataka have capped the fee and others states can follow suit. Telangana’s representative raised the private hospital issue while representatives of West Bengal and Maharashtra spoke about difficulties because of the closure of public transport including metros.Maharashtra chief secretary Ajoy Mehta suggested local trains should be allowed to run. He suggested that offices should not be allowed to operate at full strength and only 15% to 20% of staff should be allowed.Bengal chief secretary Rajeeva Sinha cited the problems in conducting door-to-door tests in slums and highly-populated areas. He also told Gauba it is extremely difficult to keep track of people supposed to be under home quarantine. States, including West Bengal, have directed various categories of people, including patients with mild symptoms, to remain under home quarantine because of a shortage of hospital beds.Gauba pointed out that some states were utilising technology and mobile phones to track people under home quarantine. He said whenever directions are given to people for self-quarantine, the authorities must also give guidance notes. Gauba added that officials in some states were even calling individuals twice daily to ask them about their well-being. The states were also told that if a Covid-19 positive person dies, his or her death should not be attributed to comorbidity alone but identified as Covid-related mortality. They were once again told to improve their ambulance services and ensure that patients do not have to spend hours in the triage areas of hospitals. Maharashtra’s representative said they have set rules to find out lapses and if a person dies within 36 to 48 hours of his or her admission, then it is considered that the surveillance at the district level has failed. Parameters for hospitals, too, have been set, Maharashtra informed the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-mobile-data-to-keep-tabs-on-home-quarantine-patients-govt/story-nREoZEmDBdBxlRbzpJcwbJ.html
12-06-2020||India||Supreme Court to hear plea on treatment of Covid-19 patients||The Supreme Court on Thursday registered a suo motu (on its own) case regarding the issues surrounding the treatment of Covid-19 patients and handling of dead bodies of Covid-19 victims in hospitals.Chief Justice of India (CJI), SA Bobde, took cognizance of the issue and assigned it to a three-judge bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, Sanjay Kishan Kaul and MR Shah that will hear the case on Friday.Former Union law minister Ashwini Kumar had written to the CJI on June 8 highlighting the undesirable manner in which patients and dead bodies were being handled. Kumar pointed out a news report of a Covid-19 patient being chained to a bed in a hospital in Madhya Pradesh. He also drew the attention of the CJI to an incident from Puducherry where a dead body was being thrown into a pit for burial. Right to die with dignity is a fundamental right and it includes the right to a decent burial or cremation, Kumar had said in his letter.This would be the third case which the top court would be hearing suo-motu in relation to issues stemming out of Covid-19.The same three-judge bench headed by justice Ashok Bhushan is hearing the case regarding the plight of migrant workers and passed orders to facilitate their return.Another three-judge bench on Thursday took suo-motu notice of the of spread of Covid-19 among 35 children in a government-run child care home in Tamil Nadu and ordered the health secretary to prepare a report on the incident and submit before Monday next week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-to-hear-plea-on-treatment-of-covid-19-patients/story-tcQsFCNq7kaReLNwOQ9XHI.html
12-06-2020||India||Most Indians are still susceptible to Covid-19, finds ICMR survey||By the end of April, only 0.73% of the over 26,000 people across 83 districts of India may have been exposed to the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a study showed, highlighting the slow spread of the pandemic in the country, but also the fact that much of its population is not immune to a disease that still has no cure. To be sure, only part of the findings of the survey have been released; a key part, on the presence of antibodies in so-called hot spots or containment zones, areas most affected by the disease is awaited. Blood samples were taken in May from 26,400 individuals in 28,595 households across 83 districts in 21 states and tested for IgG antibodies that determine a past infection due to the virus, and, therefore, also immunity — according to a few scientists. The results are reassuring as less than 1% population has shown antibodies in the survey that means we have managed to keep the pandemic suppressed successfully. This is a situation around April end as samples were lifted around mid May and it takes about 2 weeks for the results to show,” said VK Paul, chairman, Covid empowered group I, and member (health), Niti Aayog. He also added that the case mortality rate (the proportion of deaths to total Covid-19 cases) in the sample studied was just 0.08%. “This is a big achievement for a country as large as India, and if we continue to keep the loss of life minimal then it will be an accomplishment for the country,” he said. Covid-19 has, around the world, ravaged crowded urban areas and its preference for these was visible to some extent in the study conducted by the Indian Council of Medical Research, along with National Centre for Disease Control, state health departments and World Health Organization (WHO). Urban areas showed higher Covid-19 prevalence of about 1.09%, and within them, urban slums, 1.89%. “The results show rural areas were largely unaffected, and even overall prevalence was less than 1%; it means that the lockdown and containment measures in the country have been effective, and spread of the virus was slowed down successfully,” said Dr Balram Bhargava, director general, ICMR, while releasing the data at the briefing. To be sure, a repeat of the survey conducted now may throw up a different result. India saw 155,668 new cases of Covid-19 in May, 54% of its current total of 286,953 cases (as on June 10). The month also saw migrant workers returning to their homes in the hinterland from urban centres, potentially carrying the virus with them. The findings of the study also shed light on the immunity of the Indian population. Around the world, limited blood tests for Covid-19 bodies have been used to assess the immunity of the population to the disease. And they have shown that herd or mass immunity is still far away. Stopping further spread is a challenge, say experts. “You have to look at it both ways; if the percentage is low then it means there is a large geographical area where the virus hasn’t gone. Can we contain it like that for ever, and not allow the virus to enter those areas? The immunity in those areas is low, and you have to ensure no infected person goes there ever. Is that even practical or possible?,” asked Dr Shobha Broor, former head, microbiology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi. The second part of the study, which may provide details of immunity of the general population in hot spots, may still throw up a surprise. “The data for the second part is still being collated, and what we have seen so far is that infection in containment zones is high with significant variations,” said Dr Bhargava. At the briefing, Dr Bhargava also shared data that compared India’s management of the pandemic with that of other countries. The number of cases and deaths per lakh population in India are also lowest in the world, with 20.77 cases as compared to 91.67 cases globally, and 0.59 deaths in India as opposed to 5.23 deaths in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/most-indians-are-still-susceptible-to-covid-19-finds-icmr-survey/story-jxXvwUJB8kJAbkWktYHf3K.html
12-06-2020||India||‘People, planet, profit’ is PM Modi’s mantra to industry||Reiterating his call to convert the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) crisis into an opportunity to make India self-reliant, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has asked industry to focus on “people, planet and profit” and create globally competitive supply chains; emphasised on a policy shift from “command and control” to a “plug and play” economy; and urged citizens to promote “local” companies and products. Addressing the 95th annual plenary session of the Indian Chamber of Commerce (ICC) in Kolkata over video conference on Thursday, he said the entire world was gripped by the pandemic, and was fighting to overcome it. “But, amidst all this, every Indian citizen is showing a resolve to transform this disaster into an opportunity and to make this into a major turning point,” he said. He defined the turning point as a “self-reliant India”, and claimed that while this had been the aspiration of Indians for several years, it was being pursued in both policies and actions for the last 5-6 years. PM Modi gave a call for an “Atmnirbhar Bharat” in his address to the nation on May 12 when he announced a package of Rs 20 lakh crore to revive the economy that was battered by the pandemic.The PM’s remarks come in the backdrop of official data showing that the Indian economy grew at 3.1% in the last quarter, ending March 31, with growth rate for 2019-2020 slipping to 4.2%, the slowest in 11 years on the back of falling investment and consumption. A sharp fall in gross domestic product (GDP) growth is expected in this fiscal year due to prolonged 68-day lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease. The government has focused on self-reliance as the framework to deal with the crisis. In his address, PM Modi said the government will take steps to reduce import dependence and encourage local manufacturing. He urged businessmen to set up globally-competitive domestic supply chains. “This is not the time for a conservative approach. It is time for bold decisions and bold investments,” he said, pointing to how India can lead in the manufacturing of several products such as medical equipment, defence production, solar panels, batteries, chip manufacturing and aviation. In particular, the PM called for reviving the historical superiority of West Bengal in manufacturing, and said, “What Bengal thinks today, India thinks tomorrow.” ICC is the primary business chamber of east and Northeast India, with Kolkata as its base. The BJP is also locked in a fierce political battle with the ruling Trinamool Congress in the state, and is attempting to win power in assembly elections in the state next year. The PM also mentioned how the government’s emphasis on developing clusters for local produce will help the Northeast, which can become a “huge hub for organic farming”. The PM also asked industry to focus on three factors — “people, planet and profit” — and said all the three were interdependent. The PM gave the example of LED bulbs. Five years ago, an LED bulb cost ~350. But the same, he said, was now available for about ~50. This provided relief to the people, saved electricity bills worth ~19,000 crore and protected the environment. He gave another example — of waterways, and said people benefited by using it, logistics costs were reduced, and it was better for the environment. The PM’s other focus was on citizens themselves, and the need to promote local. Quoting Swami Vivekananda, who said that Indians must use their own produce and get markets for Indian products in other countries, the PM said that this path was an inspiration for India in the post-Covid world.The PM’s remarks come even as international agencies and analysts continue to debate the nature of contraction in the Indian economy over the year due to the pandemic. Fitch Ratings on Wednesday forecast a 5% contraction in the GDP this financial year, but said it expected growth to rebound to 9.5% in the next year.S&P Global Ratings, on Wednesday, said that following a 5% contraction in the current fiscal year, the economy was likely to achieve a strong 8.5% growth in the next fiscal year. S&P hoped that the recent structural reforms announced by the government along with fiscal incentives in the “Atmnirbhar Bharat” package would boost the economy. “While risks to India’s long-term growth rate are rising, ongoing economic reforms, if executed well, should keep the country’s growth rate ahead of peers,” it said.Key structural reforms announced recently include credit support for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), allowing marketing freedom to farmers, liberalisation of commercial mining activities, a policy of drawing back the scale of public sector enterprises, and opening up defence and space sectors for private entrepreneurs. Earlier, in September 2019, the government had slashed corporate tax rates to make India a manufacturing destination, which, according to S&P, should “reinforce growth” alongside additional fiscal and monetary easing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-planet-profit-is-pm-modi-s-mantra-to-industry/story-Z0Lz8LGKNVdkRGdxTbCJdP.html
12-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||The first 10 days of June have been torrid for India in terms of deaths from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). India recorded 205 deaths on June 1, then 221, 252, 270, 300, 298, 261, 342, 271, on subsequent days and finally 359 on June 10. That’s a total of 2,779 deaths in 10 days, out of a total of 8,107 deaths in the country thus far from the pandemic. The math says it best: India has seen a third of its Covid-19 deaths in the first 10 days of June.The data on deaths from Covid-19 in India has been plagued by two problems: delayed or complete lack of reporting. For instance, Delhi was recognising some deaths that took place in April only in May. According to HT’s database, Delhi’s dashboard listed only 73 deaths till May 11. On June 10, the number stood at 984 — and several of these deaths were old ones that had not been recognised. In some cases hospitals hasn’t reported them; in others they had not reported them in the format prescribed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Earlier this week, The Times of India reported, citing the Chennai corporation’s own data that Tamil Nadu’s count had left out around 236 deaths in the city (from Covid-19) from the state total. Another report in The Indian Express cited an unnamed corporation employee attributing the exclusion to procedural issues arising from inadequate staffing during the lockdown.On Thursday, Delhi’s municipal corporations claimed the actual number of deaths in the state was a little more than double (2,098) of what was being claimed by the AAP government, but at this stage, this is just a claim, albeit one that merits careful investigation and deserves some honest answers from all sides. This column has often argued that, because caseload data is meaningless, the only number that really matters is the daily death toll. Not to spot patterns — the delay in recognising deaths scotches any such effort — but to get a broad understanding of whether things are getting better or worse. The daily deaths since May 1 show that they aren’t getting better for sure — as does the trailing five-day average (both are shown in the accompanying chart). India’s case fatality rate is still less than half the global case fatality rate, but 100 days into its run in the country, the pandemic is clearly yet to peak here.Delays and lapses in recognising deaths, and outright exclusions that are now coming to light, also mean that states once feted for their response to the pandemic may not have done all that well. My reference isn’t as much to Kerala — this column has time and again pointed out that no matter how good the health care system in that state may be, its testing rate is pathetic — as it is to Tamil Nadu and Delhi. For instance, Tamil Nadu’s case fatality rate will increase from 0.88 to 1.52% if the excluded deaths are taken into account. There’s also the question of whether more deaths have been similarly excluded in the state. Delhi’s case fatality rate was just around 1% on May 11, when the national rate was 3.13%. On June 10, Delhi’s death rate was 3%, and the national rate, 2.82%.The ebb and flow of numbers suggests that while there may some outliers, most states eventually veer towards the national average. Another way of looking at it would be that in the large urban centres, the performance of governments in terms of managing Covid-19 is pretty much the same. All their health care systems (not to mention their brave health care and front line workers who have been at it since March) are under strain and nothing, from testing to hospitalisation, is proving to be easy.Delhi, Mumbai and Chennai have to prepare for a coming surge — and they are — but their experience should also be a lesson to other states, especially those that are just beginning to witness a spike. They need to test widely and indiscriminately, trace aggressively, and create dedicated treatment and quarantine facilities that are at least double what their worst-case scenarios project.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-L7eFeJxb4qfRn6CZbFyfRI.html
12-06-2020||India||At home with a little help, patients fight Covid-19||Rohini resident Richa Gupta’s husband woke up with a mild fever on May 24 and the family decided to isolate him in one of the rooms of their two-bedroom flat. Two days later, they got themselves tested by a government-run mobile sample collection unit. Her husband and four-year-old son tested positive for coronavirus disease (Covid-19).The family of Richa Gupta, 40, was concerned about her well-being because she suffers from hypertension and severe diabetes that can only be controlled with insulin shots. She is also obese.“I live with my husband, son, sister-in-law, and a full-time help and we have only one bathroom. Initially, we thought of getting admitted to the government facilities but then chose to stay at home as it was more comfortable,” said Gupta. Her husband lives in one of the rooms, she is in another room with her son, and her sister-in-law and the help stay in the living room.Her husband, Pankaj Kumar, 40, had mild fever, sore throat, and headaches. Her son, Vardhan, did not have any symptoms other than some ulcers in his mouth. And she had extreme body ache for a day.One in three of every Covid-19 positive patient in Delhi is currently isolated at home. According to data released by the Delhi government, 13,012 people are under home isolation across the city currently. Home isolation becomes all the more important as the Delhi government works towards scaling up of hospitals beds in preparation for up to 550,000 lcases of Covid-19 it expects in the city by July-end.Only those with mild symptoms – low grade fever, sore throat, headache — and no comorbid conditions like diabetes, hypertension, heart and kidney disease will be allowed to remain in home isolation. Comorbid conditions are known to increase the risk of a person developing severe symptoms of Covid-19.Nobody from the government’s health department visited Richa Gupta’s family to check their condition or their situation. Someone from the district office just put up the Home Isolation sticker on their home and left. But her husband receives a call from the government every other day checking in on his symptoms and psychological well-being. “Not only do they ask him about his fever and other symptoms, they also check how his mood is. We have also been given the number of a doctor who prescribes medicines when necessary,” she said.The family has not been given or prescribed any hydroxychloroquine, which the government’s home isolation guidelines say should be given to the caregivers as prophylaxis to prevent the infection. Their home isolation will end on Saturday.The family learnt how to make 1% hypochlorite solution — a chemical used to disinfect surfaces — on their own and have been using it to sanitise all the surface in each of the rooms twice a day and cleaning the bathroom after a visit by any of the family members. “My husband keeps all his toiletries and clothes with him. He calls out when he needs to use the bathroom, we open the door and switch on the light so that he does not touch the surfaces. After he is done, we spray the hypochlorite solution on all the surfaces and wipe it down with tissues an hour later. We spray the pot after anyone goes,” she said.With everyone in home quarantine, the family also faced problems in getting groceries. “I have subscription with an online grocery store, but they refused to deliver. Even the local grocery stores refused. Initially many of the people in my society also did not help. So, I could not get anything for two days. Now, my neighbours understand my situation and they help me out. They get me everything I need and drop it outside my door,” she said.The civic body collects her garbage every other day. “I sanitise my garbage with the hypochlorite solution and pack it in multiple layers of garbage bags,” she said.With increasing number of Covid-19 patients in home isolation, waste collection is a challenge. “The corporation has been given a list of households where Covid-19 patients live, they collect their garbage separately in a yellow bio-medical waste disposal bag and take it to the proper facilities to be discarded as bio-medical waste,” said one of the district officials on condition of anonymity.The district teams and a private home-care company hired by the Delhi government regularly monitors the condition of the patients.“Only about 7% of those who have been put under home isolation need to be moved to a hospital. The rest can recover on their own at home,” Meena Ganesh, chief executive officer of Portea, the company that has been hired by the Delhi government, told HT in a report published last week.In case they have to be transferred, the district teams are on the ready.“In case the condition of anyone in home isolation deteriorates, we get a distress call immediately and our team rushes an ambulance to the house. However, because of the regular followup we also come to know before-hand whether someone is likely to deteriorate. In addition, in our district, we have created a WhatsApp group of all the people in home isolation and some of our doctors are also on it to answer any query the people might have,” said BM Mishra, district magistrate of south Delhi.Arvind Sehgal, 56, decided to get tested for Covid-19 after feeling breathless. He did not have any fever or other symptoms of Covid-19, but tested positive for the infection on May 29. He has hypertension. Instead of waiting for the government, he hired one of the home-care services – HDU Healthcare.“Once I tested positive, I started looking for such home care services. They have provided me with a nurse and even an oxygen machine. I got better within two days of using oxygen,” he said. He is staying alone in one of the six rooms of his house.He uses utensils that are not used by other members of his family. “We assess every patient who calls us – some of them just need regular teleconsultation, others might need to be hospitalised. We refer them accordingly. However, some people who are not very sick and can recover at home with just oxygen support, we provide them with oxygen concentrator or oxygen cylinder as per their need,” said Dr Dixit Kumar Thakur, consultant of pulmonary critical care with HDU Healthcare.Several Delhi-National Capital Region hospitals such as Max Healthcare, Fortis and Medanta provide such home care to Covid-19 patients with mild to moderate disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-home-with-a-little-help-patients-fight-covid-19/story-wUjD75g6CFFPYqTJnCh1lO.html
12-06-2020||India||As Delhi’s Covid-19 testing figures stay low, labs blame Centre’s app||Fewer samples have been tested for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi over the past few days with the number falling from an average of about 7,000 samples at the end of May to around 5,000 samples on June 10. The biggest hurdle, according to laboratories, is the cumbersome RT-PCR mobile app, which has made the process of entering test data tedious; but not entering the data isn’t an option. The state government barred some labs from testing because they were not using the app. “Every single detail is documented and sent to the authorities concerned, however, it may not be in the format that the government wants because of logistical issues. If you want to punish well-meaning people for that then there is nothing we can do about it,” said an administrator in a Delhi hospital that treats Covid-19 patients. This person asked not to be identified. The app, which shares its name with the reverse transcription, polymerase chain reaction test which is the gold standard for identifying Covid-19 cases, was launched by the centre on April 30, to remove any discrepancies in sharing of Covid-related data by approved laboratories.The app is meant to be used by labs across India.Data is to be filled at the point and time of sample collection and that poses a problem. The head of a Delhi laboratory that does Covid tests rattled off the issues on condition of anonymity: poor connectivity; the fact that phlebotomists (who collect data) walk, wearing PPEs (personal protective kits) and all to collect samples because it is sometimes difficult to find parking; that they do not want to stay in the infection zone for a minute longer than required but feeding data through the app takes about 10 minutes extra. “The attrition rate of phlebotomists has gone up. It’s difficult to find new ones,” this person added. It’s not as if it is easier to do this with inpatients in hospitals, said the head of a laboratory at a private hospital who asked not to be named. “Imagine a nurse going inside the ICU with a mobile phone to feed in patient data at the time of sample of collection. You cannot do it later because you get a one-time password in the patient’s phone that you have to quickly feed in. These practical problems nobody seems to think about.” Before the introduction of mobile-based application, labs were feeding patient data into web portals created by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and respective state governments. The head of another Delhi laboratory who too spoke on condition of anonymity said “mobile phones can be potential carriers of disease-causing microorganisms.” “I don’t carry my phone while stepping out these days because there is enough evidence to show how mobile phones can be carriers of disease-causing microbes including viruses. The phone surface can be contaminated and can act as a source of infection,” says Dr Shobha Broor, former head of microbiology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.The cumbersome data entry process and the paperwork involved means laboratories get to test fewer patients, said the head of a third Delhi laboratory who asked not to be named. “It takes about 10-12 hours from the point of sample collection to a report getting ready, and most of the time is spent in paperwork, which makes for a huge volume of work in a day. It’s but natural then that it will affect the number of tests being done in a day leading to fewer tests being done.” Some laboratories have hired data entry operators specifically for doing Covid-19 related paperwork. “I have hired some 100 operators for the purpose to handle the huge work load that technicians are not trained to do,” a lab owner added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-delhi-s-testing-figures-stay-low-labs-blame-centre-s-app/story-se99V8p1r9KVOEGs7Q3ywM.html
12-06-2020||India||Odisha sisters tonsured in village kangaroo court for feasting with tribals||Two women in southern Odisha district of Koraput were allegedly tonsured by their village elders as punishment over allegations that they took part in a feast organised by a tribal and going against the practices of their community.Officials in Koraput said sisters Sumati Mali and Shanti Mali of Kadali Maliguda village in Jeypore block of Koraput were tonsured last month following a guilty verdict by a few village elders in a kangaroo court for attending a community feast of a local tribal.Though the incident happened last month, it only came to notice after other leading members of Mali community lodged a complaint with the Koraput district administration.The Malis are other backward caste found among the Hindus and have traditionally worked as gardeners and florists. The community in Odisha was earlier known for its strict practices including not allowing any community member to dine with other communities or tribes. In the undivided Koraput district, the number of Mali community people would be around 1 lakh.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesJeypore sub-collector Loknath Dalbehera said he received a complaint from Koraput Zilla Mali Samaj Vikash Parishad about two sisters being tonsured by some elders of their community. “This is condemnable act. We would take strict action against the villagers who are involved in the incident,” he said.President of Koraput Zilla Mali Samaj Vikas Parishad, Dasarath Mali said the two girls were forcibly tonsured by some members of Mali community on May 17 as penance for their alleged participation in a community feast of a Gadba tribal in the area.“The father of the two sisters died on May 7. As the Mali community members kept ostracising them, the two sisters were forced to cremate their father by themselves. During the 10th day ritual of the father’s rites, the Mali community leaders insisted that the two sisters be tonsured. Though the two girls pleaded innocence, the villagers did not take any pity and tonsured them,” said Mali, before terming it a criminal act.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19“The Mali community does not approve of such acts. Besides, our community never penalises anyone for eating at the house of tribals or other communities,” he added.Sumati Mali, 28, the eldest of the two sisters is a widowed mother who stayed with her father after the death of her husband. Both Sumati and younger sister Shanti Mali work as NREGS workers. After their heads were tonsured the two girls are finding it difficult to step out of their homes. They have been forced to cover their heads in towels.“Does anyone tonsure a girl? This is criminal. The people who have forced the two girls should be arrested for illegal confinement as well as other sections of law,” said Ramakant Roul, a social activist of Jeypore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-sisters-tonsured-in-village-kangaroo-court-for-feasting-with-tribals/story-h3kOMq23hylyJhejOQwyHN.html

The incident took place near Tehsil Gate of Utraula block in Balrampur on Wednesday evening, said Dev Ranjan Verma, SP Balrampur.Anwar, a resident of Balrampur, had gone to a local government office, when he collapsed at its gate and died at the spot. The reason of his death is not known as yet. An ambulance was parked near the gate of the office, but suspecting the man to be infected with coronavirus, refused to transport the dead body. Later, the municipal workers bundled the dead body in a garbage van. Some passersby made the video of the incident that went viral.Soon after, administration swung into action and DM Balrampur Krisnha Karunesh ordered an inquiry into the incident. “A probe was ordered and those found guilty have been suspended,” Karunesh told reporters.SP Balrampur told reporters that the incident should not have happened. “This is inhuman. They must have done it out of corona fear but still, it should not have happened. Police sub inspector Ravindra Kumar Raman, two police constables Subham Patel and Sahilendra Sharma have been suspended,” he told reporters.A senior police official said the SP has ordered the cops to be sensitive about Covid-19 situation and avoid such incidents.An official added that Anwar was a resident of Sahzora village under Sadullahnagar police station in Balrampur and had died when he had gone to a local government office on Wednesday.The dead body has been handed over to the family members for funeral, an officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-collapses-dies-body-taken-away-in-garbage-van-in-up-7-suspended/story-sY88S37EFv1v8en427kCvI.html
12-06-2020||India||Odisha bans congregation during Raja festival in view of Covid-19 pandemic||Coronavirus pandemic cast its shadow over Raja, one of the most popular festivals at the onset of monsoon, with a district administration of Odisha banning any kind of congregation between June 11 and June 16.The Keonjhar district administration in an order said any kind of gathering for celebrations like Raja Doli, Mela, Mahostav, feast and traditional games related to Raja festival is strictly prohibited between June 11 and 16 in the mineral-rich district. The festival, a tribute to menstruation of girls, is celebrated between June 14 and 16 when girls wear new clothes and swing away in mango orchards.While Raja is a quite popular festival in most places of Odisha, in Keonjhar district it is celebrated on a bigger scale. At Jalabang area of the district, thousands of people throng to witness Rajabati marriage in which clay idols of Goddess Rajabati and her groom are married. A community feast is organized and people put up swings such as ‘Ram Doli’, ‘Charki Doli’, ‘Pata Doli’ and ‘Dandi Doli’.In Sitabinj area of the district, people come in large numbers to have a glimpse of goddess Sita, and the twins-Laba and Kusha in a small temple during the festival. Legend has been that Goddess Sita stayed here when she was forsaken by Lord Rama and she gave birth to Laba and Kusha here.Though it is still not clear if any other districts would issue orders like Keonjhar district administration, a government spokesperson said people need to be responsible while celebrating Raja. “Control, carefulness, responsibility are the broader messages of Raja festival. We should adhere to these principles while celebrating Raja this time amid the pandemic,” said Odisha government’s Covid spokesperson Subroto Bagchi.The state government however on Thursday announced relaxation in the night curfew from 7 pm to 10 pm on June 12 to help them do shopping for Raja festival.

12-06-2020||India||Covid-19 kills 5 out of every 100 patients in 69 districts, triggers concern||Although the case fatality rate (CFR) has marginally dipped to 2.90% of the total number of Covid-19 cases since May 18, when the government eased lockdown norms, 69 districts in the country have CFR of 5% or more, which Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba termed as an issue of concern at a meeting with states on Wednesday, government officials said.Gauba gave a detailed presentation on the overall Covid-19 status in India as on June 9 and the challenges that have emerged since the government eased lockdown restrictions, amid state governments re-imposing lockdown curbs to control the spread of coronavirus in some states such as Rajasthan, Mizoram and Uttar Pradesh.“The case fatality rate has remained flat at 2.90% as compared to 2.96% on May 18,” the Cabinet Secretary said, indicating that there was not much reason to worry as India’s case fatality rate was lower than several western countries.The number of Covid-19 cases increased from 1,00,800 on May 18 to 2,87,155 on June 10 and the number of deaths jumped from 3,156 to 8,108 in this period.On the state specific Covid-19 data, Gauba said that 82% of all the deaths have been reported from five states --- Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh --- which also have high Covid-19 case load, though most of the deaths have occurred because of co-morbid reasons.The Cabinet Secretary also highlighted that 69 districts in the country reported more than 5% of the case fatality rate, terming it an “issue of concern.” Of them, the presentation said, the highest number of districts were in Madhya Pradesh (21), followed by Uttar Pradesh (11), Gujarat (9), Rajasthan (5) and Telangana (3). Shahdara and North-East districts in Delhi, Jind in Haryana, Kapurthala in Punjab and Bastar in Chhattisgarh with high CFR.On the total number of cases, the Cabinet Secretary said the five states that accounted for 82% of the deaths, also reported the highest rate of increase in Covid-19 cases between May 18 and June 9, resulting in the total cases in India increasing by almost 170% during this period. These states also had more than 70% of the cases in the country, the presentation said.All India Institute of Medical Sciences Director, Randeep Guleria, said India’s Covid Fatality Rate was much lower than the WHO’s prescribed limit of 3% to 3.5%. “In the districts or states having high mortality rate, the local administrations need to focus on surveillance of elderly patients with other diseases. Detailed guidelines on the same have been circulated with the state governments,” he said. Among 736 districts in the country, the presentation said, 14 districts accounted for 60% of the total Covid-19 cases in the country. Half of the districts were in the National Capital Region (NCR), including five districts of Delhi, Gurugram and Gautam Budh Nagar. Other districts were Mumbai, Chennai, Hyderabad, Pune, Thane, Chengalpattu, Ahmedabad and Kolkata, the presentation said.Some of these districts have also seen the fastest increase in Covid-19 cases since easing of restrictions on May 18, the presentation said. “These are the districts which have more than 400 cases, of which 50% of the cases have been reported after May 18. These districts are concentrated in 7 states – Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Karnataka, Jammu and Kashmir and Haryana,” the presentation said. It also pointed out that Gurugram, Udupi, Yadgir and Kolhapur have reported 90% of the 400 plus cases since May 18.On the basis of district-wise analysis of the rate of increase of Covid-19 cases, the health ministry has identified 50 districts that may face shortage of hospital beds by the first week of July. Of them, the presentation said 17 districts have high probability of witnessing shortage of hospital beds. These districts are Mumbai, Thane, Palgar, Jalgaon and Raigarh in Maharashtra, Udupi, Raichur and Yadgir in Karnataka, Kulgam and Kupwara in Jammu and Kashmir, Bharatpur in Rajasthan, Gautam Budh Nagar in Uttar Pradesh and Chennai, Chengalpattu, Thiruvallur and Turicorin in Tamil Nadu, the presentation said.On the Covid-19 confirmation rate (positives for total Covid-19 tests done), the presentation said three states --- Maharashtra, Delhi and Telangana --- has confirmation rate of more than 10% as compared to 5.70% national rate, which has increased by almost one percentage point since May 18. “The increase in confirmation rate (between May 18 and June 9) indicates at either increase in spread of coronavirus or lower testing during this period,” the presentation said. On the district-wise analysis, the presentation said that 46 districts in 13 states have a confirmation rate of more than 10% with the highest number of districts (12) in Maharashtra followed by nine in Delhi.The presentation also pointed out that there was a huge turnaround time for getting test results in several districts, especially in the rural areas. HT had reported that Jharkhand and Bihar were taking up to 14 days to provide results of the tests taken at the quarantine centers. “The delay is because of the sudden increase in the swabs being taken,” said Jharkhand health secretary Nitin Kulkarni. Bihar health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh said the pendency of the tests results is reducing as swabs of most of the symptomatic persons in quarantine centers have been taken.On the positive side, the Cabinet Secretary said that the doubling rate has increased to 16.9 days from earlier 14.1 days and the national fatality rate was still below 3%. He also said that the spread of Covid-19 cases to newer districts was not very high and the situation there was under control. Gauba said that several districts have reported slowing down of Covid-19 cases, which indicated that the lockdown had a positive impact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-india-69-districts-have-case-fatality-rate-double-than-that-of-national-average-govt/story-G9CbhYYu8EneRQUPEjfDbK.html
12-06-2020||India||PM Oli convenes special sitting to clear new map; India to cold-shoulder him||Nepal’s parliament will hold a special meeting on Saturday to complete voting on a new political map that redraws its border with India. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s push to get parliament to hold a special sitting on a public holiday - Saturday is the weekly public holiday in Nepal - is seen as an effort to signal his determination to escalate the boundary row with India.The new map shows Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani - a sliver of land counted as part of India’s Uttarakhand in the older maps - to be in northwestern Nepal.Nepal’s lower house had backed the constitution amendment bill that formalises the new map on Tuesday this week. But before lawmakers can vote on the bill, parliamentary procedures require the legislature to give 72 hours to allow any MP to move an amendment. No amendments have been proposed so far, people familiar with the development in Kathmandu told Hindustan Times.The 72-hour period ends on Friday evening.An India official said the fact that PM Oli did not wait for parliament’s next working day to take up the legislation on the new map speaks volumes about his intentions.Also read | In Nepal’s map tactics, a reflection of China’s growing footprint in KathmanduPM Oli, who has been facing pressure from his rivals within the ruling party, came up with the surprise move last month within 10 days of India formally opening a road to Lipulekh Pass for Kailash Mansarovar pilgrims.In Delhi and Kathmandu, the new map has been seen as an attempt by the Communist Party of Nepal leader to consolidate public support behind him and whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments.The announcement, which came around the same time that a standoff between India and China was at its peak, is also seen to have the blessings of Beijing’s communist party.In April this year when PM Oli had issued two ordinances to amend the anti-defection law to blunt a political offensive launched by his detractors, China got him to scrap the changes within five days. Chinese president Xi Jinping’s emissaries told PM Oli that he should not allow the communist party to be split over their differences.India has described PM Oli’s map as a “unilateral act” that was not based on historical facts or evidence and asked Kathmandu to “refrain from such unjustified cartographic assertion” for an “artificial enlargement of territorial claims”.To be sure, Prime Minister Oli told lawmakers on Wednesday that he had sought talks to resolve the dispute with India.“We have told (them) that we want to resolve this through diplomatic talks ... And the solution is that our land should be returned to us,” Oli said in parliament on Wednesday. He also deplored Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s comment that asked Nepal to think through the long-term consequences of its decision and asked Kathmandu to remember what happened to Tibet.Indian officials have also told Hindustan Times that New Delhi had taken note of the developments around the map and stressed that parliamentary approval would seal any possibility of dialogue between the two sides on the “dispute manufactured by Kathmandu”.But do not expect many harsh statements from the government, one of them said, suggesting that New Delhi was more likely to go for the silent treatment as far as the Nepal leadership is concerned but keep its focus on cementing ties with the people of Nepal.That approach was on display in New Delhi on Thursday when external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava was asked about the developments around the map. Srivastava spoke about friendly relations between the two countries and India’s cooperation via-a-vis Covid-19. But on the map, he refused to say much except to stress that New Delhi had already made its position clear.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepal-pm-oli-out-to-prove-a-point-convenes-special-sitting-to-clear-lipulekh-map/story-3fTSpvUIZZcrFLkrn5BynL.html
