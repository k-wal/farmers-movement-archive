It was the second phase of the conference--the first was held in Delhi on May 27-29.The top commanders met a day after defence minister Rajnath Singh made a detailed assessment of the situation at the disputed border and was briefed by the military brass about the preparations of the armed forces and their readiness to respond to any provocative actions by the Chinese forces.Singh left for Moscow on Monday for a four-day visit during which he will meet his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, and border tensions with China will figure in their talks. Singh will participate in the Victory Day parade on June 24 in Moscow to commemorate the surrender of Nazi Germany in 1945.Tensions between India and China have surged after the Galwan Valley brawl on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, dead. The Chinese army possibly suffered more than twice as many casualties, which also included a commanding officer, said another officer.With uncertainty looming along the LAC, the government has given financial powers worth Rs 500 crore per project to the armed forces to fast-track the purchase of critical weapons and ammunition to deal with any kind of scenario. Similar powers were bestowed on the military to pug gaps in capabilities after 2016 terror attack in Jammu & Kashmir’s Uri and the 2019 airstrikes in Pakistan’s Balakot in response to a suicide bombing in Pulwama that left 40 paramilitary troopers dead.INDEPENDENT COMMENT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-top-brass-assesses-ground-situation/story-IuAfJ7OKqxuRcdpE9PtBKM.html
22-06-2020||India||PLA unit CO ‘among casualties’ in Galwan||New Delhi: A People’s Liberation Army (PLA) unit commanding officer (CO) was among scores of Chinese soldiers killed in the June 15 Galwan Valley clash with Indian troops along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh, people familiar with the matter said on Monday. The Chinese commander’s death was confirmed to the Indian side through diplomatic and military channels last week, said one of the persons cited above, asking not to be named.China has not said anything about any losses it suffered in the hand-to-hand combat. At a regular briefing on Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry stalled a query on the number of casualties the PLA suffered.The brutal clash at Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh resulted in 20 Indian deaths, including that of a CO. The Chinese army possibly suffered more than twice the casualties, Union minister General V K Singh (retd) said on Saturday. It was the first such clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the contested LAC in 45 years.The Chinese CO’s body was among the bodies exchanged by the two sides after the clash was over on June 16, said another person cited above.The moment Indian soldiers realised that their CO, Colonel B Santosh Babu, had fallen, they fought against the Chinese soldiers with all their might and killed 16 of them and inflicted life-threatening injuries on scores of others in a fearsome counter-attack.The seven-hour face-off involved three staggered clashes and saw the Indian soldiers put up a fierce fight against Chinese troops, who had been pulled out of another sector and freshly deployed on the disputed border to carry out the premeditated attack, as reported by HT on Monday. The Indian and Chinese COs were killed in the second and the most fierce round of fighting.The clash involved 600 soldiers from both sides, with the Indians badly outnumbered.Details from the debriefing of Indian soldiers involved in the skirmish revealed the heroism of the Indian troops, who fought off numerically superior rivals and the tactics of the Chinese soldiers.The Indian soldiers were carrying weapons and ammunition. But they did not open fire as they were following border agreements between the two countries, the government said last week. The clarification came following a political controversy over whether the Indian soldiers were carrying weapons that could have been used to defend themselves.INDEPENDENT COMMENT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-unit-co-among-casualties-in-galwan/story-54qe4y5LUoPqPX7XlbM2AJ.html
22-06-2020||India||Trump rejected Modi’s waiver case on Iran curbs, writes Bolton||President Donald Trump personally shut down a fierce debate among his aides in April 2019 on additional exemptions for countries such as India from US sanctions on Iran oil purchases and ordered wavering officials to “go to zero”, and he had “not been sympathetic” to India’s case as made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, former National Security Adviser John Bolton writes in his book, “The Room Where It Happened”.These deliberations took place around April 18, and the United States announced on April 21 the end of waivers from secondary sanctions for countries that continued to buy Iranian crude, forcing India, a net importer of crude, and others impacted to look for new suppliers.It was not an easy decision, according to Bolton, who gives the first peek at behind-the-scene discussions that preceded and is known for his hawkish stand on Iran.Trump was “vibrating increasingly” on the end-the-waivers side of the scale, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was “wobbly”, writes Bolton. State department officials were afflicted by “clientitis”, a phrase he uses to imply they were loyal to countries in their assignment portfolios, and not the US.“But India is so important,” he writes, citing state department officials. Or, “Japan is so important.” Bolton says he could understand India’s case that it will not easily find an alternative supplier at the same low price Iran was charging. But its position was inconsistent with America’s, he argued.Trump ended the discussions on April 18. “Go to zero,” Bolton quotes the President as saying, and goes on to add that “in a phone call with Pompeo, Trump had not been sympathetic to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying, ‘He’ll be okay’.”Iran was the second largest supplier of crude for India at the time and the sanctions significantly disrupted India’s oil supplies. Indian investments in Chabahar port in Iran, which provides India crucial trade routes into Afghanistan and Central Asian countries, were left untouched. India was indeed “okay” with the Trump administration’s decision, thus, and has since found other sellers, including the United States.India and a bunch of other countries, including US allies Japan and South Korea, were granted waivers from the first round of sanctions that came into effect in November 2018, following President Trump’s decision earlier in the year to withdraw the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) signed in 2015 by the US, UK, France, Russia, China and the European Union with Iran. The pact ended United Nations-led sanctions, bolstered by US add-ons, in return for Iran mothballing its nuclear weapons programme.Bolton’s book is based on his 16 months as Trump’s third National Security Adviser. The print edition is slated for release on Tuesday, but pirated editions were available online over the weekend.The former NSA has been surprisingly dismissive of the February-March 2019 tensions between India and Pakistan after the capture of an Indian Air Force pilot by Pakistan. The United States had waded into the issue to prevent an escalation between the two nuclear-armed countries.“After hours of phone calls, the crisis passed, perhaps because, in substance, there never really had been one,” Bolton writes nonchalantly of the crisis.“But when two nuclear powers spin up their military capabilities, it is best not to ignore it,” he adds in the book, but essentially to reprise his well-known reservations about Trump’s outreach to North Korea’s Kim Jon Un.On the other sanctions issue, stemming from the Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that targets Russia and seeks to punish it by scaring away its major defence purchases with the threat of secondary sanctions, Bolton says the President asked him to look into an article that said India was buying Russian S-400 missile defence system because it found them better than the American Patriots.The US has offered Terminal High Altitude Area Defence (THAAD) systems and Patriot Advance Capability missile defence system as an alternative to the S-400. But India is sticking with the Russian deal for now.The book also confirms Trump was dismissive of the $3-billion Indian assistance in Afghanistan, as reported earlier. “India builds a library and advertises it all over,” Bolton writes, quoting Trump. India has built and repaired many structures as a part of its reconstruction efforts, but a library is not among them. The President might have been referring to the Afghan parliament India has constructed on the outskirts of Kabul.The book has already generated a fair amount of interest and controversy, as reported by Hindustan Times earlier, with Bolton claiming President Trump pleaded with President Xi Jinping of China to help him win a second term, and backed his repressive measures in Hong Kong and the concentration camps for Uyghur Muslims.Bolton also writes that Trump’s closest and loyal aides mocked him behind his back, such as Pompeo, who, the ex-NSA writes, passed him a note during a meeting with Kim, saying Trump is “full of s…”. Pompeo has denied it and called Bolton a “traitor”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-rejected-modi-s-waiver-case-on-iran-curbs-writes-bolton/story-iJbzQQRlxtpkFCOOLLEzGP.html
22-06-2020||India||CBSE to apprise SC over board exams||New Delhi: The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) is on Tuesday likely to inform the Supreme Court about the challenges it will face due to Covid-19 pandemic if it conducts remaining Class 10 and 12 board exams in July and then act according to its directions, Union Human Resource Development (HRD) ministry officials said.The officials said they feel the circumstances are not very conducive for conducting the examinations and it was felt that any final decision should be taken following the court’s direction.“The decision to conduct exams in July was taken with hope that the situation would normalise. However, there are a number of areas, including the national capital, where there are a large number of [Covid-19] cases. CBSE has made elaborate plans to ensure social distancing. However, there are challenges given the unpredictable nature of the pandemic. Therefore, CBSE will apprise the court about the situation and act according to its direction,” said an official, who did not wish to be named.The Supreme Court last week asked CBSE to consider scrapping the remaining papers and allotting marks on the basis of internal assessment. It asked CBSE to take instructions and inform the court by Tuesday about it.Officials said they will have to decide on criteria for allotting the marks if the exams are cancelled, which will also create uncertainty regarding the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) and National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) exams which were to follow the CBSE exams scheduled from July 1 to 15.“There can be criteria on the basis of internal assessment, on the basis of pre-boards or how the student performed in exams which were conducted. It is likely these aspects will also come up,” said the official.“The CBSE had drawn up plans to conduct the exams. However, there were many representations from parents and even some states were not keen. We are sure a direction will emerge from the court ruling which will definitely be looking at the overall picture.”A second official said a decision on holding NEET and JEE will be taken later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-to-apprise-sc-over-board-exams/story-HLyHEQaFVPBnVaGeQzEtTJ.html

We have got 114 positive cases from the samples given by the public voluntarily at 12 centres in the city. In total we got 144 cases in Guwahati without any travel or contact history,” Sarma told journalists in Guwahati.The minister warned that unless the public strictly followed safety measures like wearing masks, sanitizing hands frequently and maintaining social distance, the number of cases in Guwahati could rise exponentially in the next few days.Till now Guwahati had over 100 containment zones. But following detection of the fresh cases, the health department has recommended total lockdown in wards where a sizable number of positive cases are detected. Sarma clarified that the entire city won’t be put under lockdown.After detection of several positive cases without any travel or contact history, the health department had started a campaign on June 15 to test 50,000 samples in the city within two weeks in a bid to ascertain the spread of Covid-19 in Guwahati.Besides focusing on areas where trucks coming from other states operated, 12 sample collection centres were also opened across the city where members of the public could give swab samples voluntarily.Till Monday, nearly 5,000 samples had been collected and results of around 3,000 have been delivered. Sarma said that the target of 50,000 tests would be completed by the end of June.“We had not expected that people would come on their own and give samples, but were surprised to find that on an average nearly 400 people are coming to the 12 centres daily and giving swabs,In a bid to increase screening, from Wednesday 31 sample collection centres would be started in government schools across the city where people would be able to come and give swab samples for testing.“These centres will have a doctor and other healthcare staff and will soon be equipped with TrueNat testing machines so that results can be delivered within hours,” said Sarma.“We expect the number of cases in Guwahati to rise in coming days. At a later stage depending on the number of cases, our quarantine centres would be converted to Covid care facilities for asymptomatic patients and only symptomatic patients will be admitted to hospitals,” he added.Assam has recorded 5,586 Covid-19 positive cases till date. There have been 3,521 recoveries and 10 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guwahati-contemplates-limited-lockdown-after-community-screening-detects-114-covid-19-cases/story-i3cwsmCu5JFUzLZHAwMdHJ.html

The staff member who tested positive lives with his family within the mission’s premises in Chanakyapuri.People familiar with developments said two members of the family of the staff member had also tested positive. This is possibly the first case of a staff member of a foreign mission testing positive for Covid-19, they said on condition of anonymity.“We advised most of the officers and other members of staff to work from home and come to office if necessary, following related safety measures,” Bangladesh high commissioner Mohammad Imran was quoted as saying by state-run BSS news agency.Asked about media reports that the mission had been closed for 10 days for sanitizing the premises, Imran said: “The office is open and all regular routine activities are going on.”Imran said all the mission’s communication channels are open for people to communicate with officials.

22-06-2020||India||SC stays CPCB’s Rs 18-lakh fine on NTPC for non-compliance of emission norms||The Supreme Court has stayed an order passed by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) imposing a penalty of Rs 18 lakh on National Thermal Power Corporation’s (NTPC) Dadri plant. The country’s largest power producing utility was found to be non-compliant with the new emission norms introduced by the Centre in 2015 and was directed to deposit this penalty every month beginning June, 2020.The NTPC approached the apex Court last week against the CPCB order of May 8 claiming that the pollution regulator failed to acknowledge the proceeding in the air pollution matter (MC Mehta case) where the issue of compliance of the 2015 New Environmental Norms for Thermal Power Plants is still pending. These norms were introduced by the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEF&CC) in order to curb the increasing levels of air pollution in Delhi and surrounding National Capital Region (NCR).Solicitor General Tushar Mehta representing NTPC informed a bench of Justices Arun Mishra and S Abdul Nazeer that the apex court while hearing the MC Mehta case on December 10, 2018 noted the minutes of a meeting conducted by the Union Environment and Power Ministries with the amicus curiae assisting the Court and came to a consensus on allowing NTPC time till December 2021 to comply with the 2015 norms.Amicus curiae and senior advocate Aparajita Singh who was appearing in the matter through video conferencing informed the Court that NTPC has already begun efforts to install Flue Gas Desulphurization (FGD) in its plants in order to achieve reduced emission levels of sulphur dioxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulate matter.The bench issued notice on NTPC’s application and said, “Recovery so far as regards to NTPC Ltd to remain stayed till the next date of hearing.” The Court posted the next hearing to July last week.On a reading of the May 8 CPCB order, there is no mention of the MC Mehta case proceedings pending in the apex court. However, its decision has been guided by the timelines set by the Ministry of Power directing thermal power plants situated within a 300-kilometre radius of Delhi to comply with the revised norms by December 31, 2019. The CPCB had worked out the penalty figure of Rs 18 lakh based on Dadri project’s non-compliance beginning January 1, 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-cpcb-s-rs-18-lakh-fine-on-ntpc-for-non-compliance-of-emission-norms/story-6VViz5vLlLiCCM5DWR5vbO.html
22-06-2020||India||Students in Kashmir suffer as internet is suspended frequently during encounters||The frequent suspension of 2G internet services by authorities in Kashmir’s districts during gunfights between terrorists and security forces is causing huge problems for college and university students who nowadays are appearing for their online internal examinations.The student community of the valley, already bearing the brunt of slow internet speed during the Covid-19 lockdown, is left high and dry by the authorities when they snap mobile internet whenever a gunfight starts in a particular district leaving the examination schedules in disarray.When Majid Lone, an undergraduate student of Islamia College of Science and Commerce (ICSC) in Srinagar woke up on Sunday, he found there was no internet service on his mobile as an encounter had started in Zadibal area of the city. He got really worried as his internal exam was scheduled to be held online for the day.“When I made some calls I came to know about the encounter and postponement of the exams. This is second time that the exam was postponed. Mobile internet was also suspended in south Kashmir on Thursday and Friday after encounters erupted there,” he said.While three terrorists were killed in Zadibal encounter on Sunday, eight terrorists were killed on Thursday and Friday in two separate gun battles in south Kashmir’s Pulwama and Shopian districts. A terrorist was also killed in Kulgam on Saturday. Another encounter erupted in Anantnag on Monday.The intensity of gun battles has increased in the past few months in Kashmir valley. So far at-least 106 terrorists have been killed this year across the valley of which 36 have been killed in June alone particularly in south Kashmir. More gun battles mean more instances of internet suspension in individual districts which means educational institutes have to either take exams of the affected district afresh or reschedule the whole process.A computer science student of Islamic University of Science and Technology (IUST) in Pulwama district said that their internal viva exams were going on online on Thursday when the internet suddenly snapped.“Three students managed to give their viva exams when suddenly the teacher became offline. We were around 80 students waiting for our turns. The whole schedule got disrupted as the internet was restored on Saturday when the exams were held again,” she said.When the lockdown was implemented in mid-March to stop the spread of coronavirus, student communities across the country took advantage of high speed internet to get in touch with their teachers and appeared for online classes. However the student communities in Jammu and Kashmir are an unfortunate lot as first they were cut off for months last year when internet was suspended following the revocation of special status of the region. When the internet was restored in January this year, the authorities decided to ban the high speed internet and allowed only 2G speeds.IUST student Abrar Ahmad, who is doing his B.Tech in Electronics and Communication Engineering, said that the students of the valley suffer a lot due to internet issues.“Already due to 2G, our online classes were in name only. Now our teachers decided to hold our internal exams online which will help them to asses our performance as proper examinations in the pandemic are very risky. But then day in and day out suspension of mobile internet is making it very cumbersome for the education fraternity,” Ahmad said.“On Sunday our exams were scheduled but due to internet suspension that could not be held. Our next paper is on Tuesday, so the university authorities may squeeze in the rescheduled paper a day before or after which makes it very tiresome for us,” he said.When HT attempted to ask government’s secretary for higher education Talat Parvez Rohella about the issue, his phone was switched off. Calls to divisional commissioner Kashmir, Pandurang K Pole did not yield any response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/students-in-kashmir-suffer-as-internet-is-suspended-frequently-during-encounters/story-2wM9WwW59vcKEPQ89LOiTI.html

22-06-2020||India||10 days on, Kedarnath priest protests bare-chested against Char Dham Board||Priests at all Char Dham shrines in Uttarakahand will soon start protests against the state government’s decision to set up the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board, the Devbhoomi Tirtha Purohit Haqhakudhari Mahapanchayat, an association of priests of all the four shrines said Monday.A priest from the Kedarnath shrine already began a solo protest 10 days ago, sitting bare-chested in cold conditions outside the shrine.The Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board was formed last December to manage 51 temples including the Char Dham shrines. The priest community had opposed the move and alleged that they were kept in the dark about the law. They alleged that the government took such a step to sideline them and ensure full government control of temple related issues.In December last year, the Uttarakhand state assembly had passed the Char Dham Shrine Management Board Bill with a small change in its name by replacing the word ‘Shrine’ with ‘Devasthanam’ on the last day of the winter session.Santosh Trivedi, the priest sits outside the Kedarnath temple and meditates as a sign of protest, demanding that the Board should be suspended. The portals of the shrine opened on April 29 this year. The priest community in the state feels that the state government is only eyeing the funds generated by the temples.Vinod Shukla, president of Kedarnath Tirtha Purohit Mahasabha, a priests’ body of the shrine said, “Santosh Trivedi, the tirtha purohit of Kedarnath has been protesting since June 12 against the formation of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board. As a sign of protest, Trivedi meditates thrice a day outside the shrine when prayers are being offered.” Prayers are offered thrice at the shrine which takes approximately four hours.Brijesh Sati, spokesperson of Devbhoomi Tirtha Purohit Haqhakudhari Mahapanchayat, a priests’ body of all the Char Dham shrines said protests against the board will soon start at other shrines also.“The priests of shrines like Gangotri, Yamunotri and Badrinath are discussing on how to step up the protests and soon they will start at those shrines also,” said Sati.The priests have not accepted the formation of the Board and have been protesting since November before it was formed.Ravinath Raman, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board said the priests can protest, but the Board is a government body formed through an Act.“It is their democratic right to protest, so we cannot say anything about this. The Board is a government body made through an Act, so we cannot comment.” said Raman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/10-days-on-kedarnath-priest-protests-bare-chested-against-char-dham-board/story-WbbXrNQ5iSAL6RGTHnhgoK.html

With India’s coronavirus tally currently at 425,282 cases, Maharashtra remains the worst-hit state by the pandemic, accounting for almost one-third of the country’s total count.The state reported 113 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the death toll to 6,283Financial capital Mumbai touched 67,586 with 1,098 new infections across the city.With 66 fatalities recorded in the last 24 hours, the city’s death toll climbed to 3,737 as more people succumbed to the deadly virus.A total of 1,962 patients were discharged on Monday across the state, taking the number of recovered patients to 67,706, a health official said.The number of active cases in Maharashtra under treatment now stands at 61,793.In some encouraging news for the state, however, Asia’s largest slum, Mumbai’s Dharavi has managed to flatten the coronavirus curve to a large extent. But after a brief lull of about two weeks the deadly infection was back again with seventeen fresh Covid-19 cases being reported on June 19. Despite reporting new Covid-19 cases, the Union health ministry on Sunday said that due to proactive measures adopted by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the Covid-19 growth rate in Dharavi has dipped to 1.02% in June.Known for being highly congested with eight to ten people living in small shanties, the virus had started spreading swiftly in Dharavi in the month of April. A slew of steps taken by the BMC with regular testing and isolation of Covid-19 positive patients helped the Mumbai slum to curb the spread of the infectious disease largely. Currently, the total number of coronavirus cases in Dharavi stands at 2,158. Barely eight days after recording 3 lakh Covid-19 infections, India on Sunday crossed the four lakh-mark with the biggest single-day spike of 15,413 new patients.The country has a total of 1,74,384 active Covid-19 cases and 237,195 people have been cured of the disease, according to the health ministry. The country’s death toll now stands at 13,699.India has seen a surge of 2,19,926 infections from June 1 till June 21 with Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh among the top five states that have seen a sharp rise in coronavirus cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-s-covid-19-count-soars-by-3-721-new-cases-to-over-1-35-lakh-113-more-die/story-eWXk3vFmZRGeyb21kFgPUN.html

It was the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the contested LAC in 45 years.The Chinese CO’s body was among the bodies exchanged by the two sides after the clash was over on June 16, said the second person cited above.The moment the Indian soldiers realised that their CO, Colonel B Santosh Babu, had fallen they fought against the Chinese soldiers with all their might and killed 16 of them and inflicted life-threatening injuries on scores of others in a fearsome counter attack.The seven-hour deadly conflict involved three staggered clashes and saw the Indian soldiers put up a fierce fight against Chinese troops who had been pulled out of another sector and freshly deployed on the disputed border to carry out the premeditated attack, as reported by HT on Monday. The Indian and Chinese COs were killed in the second and the most fierce round of fighting.The clash involved 600 soldiers from both sides, with the Indians badly outnumbered.Details from the debriefing of Indian soldiers involved in the skirmish reveal the heroism of the Indian troops who fought off numerically superior rivals and the tactics of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army.The Indian soldiers were carrying weapons and ammunition but did not open fire as they were following border agreements between the two countries, the government said last week following a political controversy erupted over whether the Indian soldiers were carrying weapons that could have been used to defend themselves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-commanding-officer-killed-in-galwan-valley-clash/story-oRS6OrVIT92GCVIYAGUGhK.html

Two people, including the trailer driver and the operator of the excavator, were injured. The condition of one person is said to be serious, said police. According to Mohammed Asif Khan, station house officer, Munsiyari police station, “The incident happened at around 9 am near Dhapa bend on the road towards the LAC.”“At the time of the incident, there was construction work going on for another bridge near the collapsed one which was not in a good condition. When the trailer came there, the workers warned the driver not to cross it by claiming it will collapse as it can bear the load of only a four-wheeler at a given time. However, the driver tried to cross it, resulting in the accident,” said Khan. The police reached there soon after the incident and rushed the two persons to a nearby hospital with the help of locals. Khan said, “Of the two, the trailer driver - identified as Godhan, a resident of Almora district - is in stable condition while the other identified as Lakhbir Singh, a resident of Punjab, is serious.”The police officer said that during the probe it was found that the trailer was transporting the excavator to a road construction project of Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in the Lilam Valley near the LAC. “After the collapse of the bridge, the area beyond that has been cut off as there is no other way to cross it. The BRO officials have said that they will soon repair the collapsed bridge to resume connectivity in the next 7-8 days after removing the damaged vehicles from the spot,” said Khan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bridge-near-line-of-actual-control-collapses-into-rivulet-in-uttarakhand/story-Zqhzfly9dD38giz7C30jUL.html

The complaint filed against them by Islamabad Police had accused them of rash driving and possessing fake Pakistani currency but theses charge were denied by New Delhi.Pakistani security agencies had detained the staff members and held them for almost 12 hours, releasing them after Pakistani charge d’affaires Syed Haider Shah was summoned to the external affairs ministry for lodging a strong protest.An official statement issued last week had said the two staff members of the Indian mission were “forcibly abducted by Pakistani agencies…and kept in illegal custody for more than 10 hours” and also “subjected to interrogation, torture and physical assault”.It is believed the two men were withdrawn from Islamabad. Meanwhile, the Indian high commission in Islamabad has announced it will facilitate the return of 748 Indian nationals from Pakistan via the Wagah-Attari land border during June 25-27.A total of 250 Indian nationals will return on June 25 while another 250 will return the following day. The remaining Indian national will be repatriated via the land border crossing on June 27, according to a notification posted on the mission’s website.The Indian nationals being repatriated were asked to make arrangements to reach the Wagah-Attari border crossing.Hundreds of Indians, most of them students or people visiting relatives, were stranded in Pakistan after the Indian government imposed travel restrictions in March to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. In the absence of flights between the two countries, many people had asked to be allowed to cross over via the land border crossing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2-indian-mission-staffers-detained-by-pakistani-agencies-return-via-wagah/story-olAup8z4jGRH69djLlv1ZK.html
22-06-2020||India||How Centre, nudged by PM Modi, made a case for Rath Yatra in Supreme Court||Just about the time when millions of devotees were about to suffer a collective heartbreak over the grim prospect of Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath and his siblings not happening this year, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court on Monday afternoon allowed the juggernaut of the three deities to roll on the Grand Road of Puri. Reversing its June 18 order - where the court halted the yatra citing public health and citizens’ safety amid a raging coronavirus pandemic - the apex court on Monday allowed the festival minus devotees, who have always been inseparable part of its tradition since centuries, following a change in the stand of the Odisha government. Today’s order was as dramatic as the state government’s initial stand on not letting it happen due to the coronavirus and then doing a complete volte face in the face of public outcry. On social media, the top court’s decision is being hailed as the wish of the Lord prevailing over everyone.While hectic preparations are on to hold the Rath Yatra at Puri on June 23 without the presence of any devotees, the play of politics behind the entire event may be too glaring to miss. While the Odisha BJP unit has been uncharacteristically silent over the Rath Yatra issue, union home minister Amit Shah on Monday indicated that PM Modi nudged him to hold consultations with the Shankaracharya and the King of Puri. “PM Narendra Modi not only understood the sentiments of devotees but also initiated consultations. Last evening, as per the instructions of the PM, I spoke to Gajapati Maharaj Ji (the king of Puri) and the respected Shankaracharya ji of Puri and sought their views on the Yatra. “This morning, on PM’s instructions, I also spoke to the Solicitor General. It makes me, as well as crores of devotees across India happy that PM not only understood the sentiment of the devotees but also initiated consultations which ensured that the great traditions of our land are observed,” tweeted Shah in Odia.The home minister’s tweet that his government facilitated placing the matter in front of a vacation bench of the Supreme Court is an indication of the importance that the party places on Odisha. Though the state elections in Odisha are four years away and the panchayat polls more than one and half years away, the Naveen Patnaik government’s flip-flop over Rath Yatra gave the opportunity to BJP to make some more inroads into the mind of Odia electorate. The party over the last few years has been unsuccessfully trying to appropriate the Jagannath culture and blend it into their overall Hindutva campaign. Puri has been central to its overall political theme. Last year, the BJP was toying with the idea of letting Modi fight from the Puri Lok Sabha constituency but later allowed its national spokesperson Sambit Patra to contest the seat. Patra lost the seat to BJD’s lawyer-turned-politician Pinaki Mishra by a whisker. In early February, a month before Covid-19 lockdown started, home minister Shah in a political rally in Bhubaneswar spoke how Odisha is like his second home as Lord Jagannath has kept “showering his blessings on both Gujarat and Odisha.”Political analysts said the BJP first tested the waters last month when the ministry of home affairs allowed construction of the three chariots on Grand Road at a time when a strict national lockdown was in place that prohibited any construction activity.“By allowing construction of the chariots, the Centre wanted to show that it never came in the way of the Rath Yatra, the biggest festival of Odisha, even during the time of a pandemic. It ensured that the BJD would never be able to accuse it of holding up the festival,” said Gyana Ranjan Swain, political science professor of Ravenshaw University in Cuttack.Though it was expected that the Patnaik government would be able to hold the festival minus devotees, the plan began to go awry by May-end when suddenly the number of Covid-19 cases in the state saw a steep rise in numbers due to the influx of migrant workers. From less than 15 districts by May first week, the entire state of Odisha was soon in the clutches of the pandemic by May end making things difficult for the government. The rising number of cases outside the quarantine centres too fuelled the fears of local transmission of the virus. The officials were decidedly nervous over the possibility of a full scale community transmission once lakhs of devotees thronged the temple town of Puri on the day of Rath Yatra.So when a little-known NGO went to the Supreme Court, allegedly with some backing from sections of government seeking stay on Rath Yatra due to the pandemic, the Patnaik government played along and reeled out figures of a million devotees congregating in Puri. With SC halting the Yatra on June 18, the BJD did not account for the massive outrage among lakhs of devotees as well as the temple priests who felt shortchanged by the government. Many felt the government could have told the apex court that it can organise the Rath Yatra the way it conducted the Snana Purnima festival, an important festival preceding the car festival, in the first week of June. The BJP’s image as a saviour of the biggest festival of Odisha may have come unexpectedly, but it nicely fits into its grand scheme of things it has for Odisha. By helping the juggernaut to roll on June 23, the party perhaps thinks its own caravan in Odisha would get a push.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-centre-nudged-by-pm-modi-made-a-case-for-rath-yatra-in-supreme-court/story-RkisFIzBAHlXtToGe51AWP.html

On Monday, the state reported 138 fresh cases taking the tally 3,310, said Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s office.In the last three days, the state has reported more than 100 Covid-19 cases daily.

22-06-2020||India||India condemns abduction of Sikh community leader in Afghanistan||India on Monday condemned the abduction of a Sikh community leader in Afghanistan and said the targeting and persecution of minorities by “terrorists at the behest of their external supporters” is a matter of concern.Nedan Singh was kidnapped by unidentified persons in Tsamkani district of Paktia province in eastern Afghanistan last week. He was employed as a helper at a gurdwara.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said, “We strongly condemn the abduction of Mr Nedan Singh, a leader of the Hindu and Sikh community of Afghanistan by terrorists.“The targeting and persecution of minority community members by terrorists at the behest of their external supporters is a matter of grave concern.”Srivastava didn’t name any country for being behind the abduction though his remarks pointed the finger at Pakistan, which has long been accused by India of backing terror groups active in Afghanistan.“India is in touch with the government of Afghanistan for ensuring the safety, security and well-being of the minority community in Afghanistan. We hope that the government of Afghanistan would be able to secure safe and early release of Mr Nedan Singh,” Srivastava added.The abduction comes months after nearly 30 members of the Sikh minority were killed in a terror attack on a place of worship in Kabul on March 25. That attack was claimed by the Islamic State though officials have said the Haqqani Network and Lashkar-e-Taiba were linked to the deadly assault.Afghanistan’s Sikh minority has dwindled to a few hundred families after being targeted by the Taliban and other groups in recent decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-condemns-abduction-of-sikh-community-leader-in-afghanistan/story-uhodgUCQAumOOcPdVfM8lJ.html
22-06-2020||India||No threat to Manipur govt, crisis will be resolved in 2-3 days: Himanta Biswa Sarma||Himanta Biswa Sarma, the convenor of the North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led front of anti-Congress forces in the northeast, said on Monday that there is no threat to the N. Biren Singh-led coalition government in Manipur and the ongoing political crisis in the border state would blow over the next two-three days.The BJP-led coalition in Manipur was reduced to a minority last week after three party MLAs resigned and six other MLAs—four from National People’s Party (NPP), one from Trinamool Congress (TMC) and an Independent legislator - withdrew support to it.“The situation is more or less under control. We are consulting all our MLAs and things will be resolved nicely. There is nothing to worry,” Sarma, a senior minister in Assam’s BJP-led government, told journalists in Guwahati.Sarma had played a crucial role in formation of the first BJP-led government in Manipur in 2017 when the party had secured 21 seats in the 60-member house even though the Congress had won 28.However, it was able to form government with support of other NEDA constituents--NPP, Naga People’s Front (NPF)—and MLAs from TMC, Lok Janshakti Party and an Independent legislator.On Sunday, Sarma along with NPP national president and CM Sangma had flown to Manipur capital Imphal on a chartered flight to hold discussions and bury the differences among the coalition partners.“All discussions took place in a very positive manner. You will see good results in the next two-three days. There’s absolutely no worry. I’ll visit Imphal again on Tuesday,” Sarma said.Speculations have been rife that Singh might step down in a bid to bring back the dissident NPP lawmakers into the coalition government, as they had resigned complaining against the CM’s style of functioning.Sarma, however, rubbished the speculations about the leadership change.“As the Speaker Yumnam Khemchand Singh had disqualified some MLAs, there could be some difference in the ‘architecture’ of the coalition, but more or less we’re continuing with the spirit of the NEDA and the NDA. All complaints and grievances will be addressed. There’s no question of any leadership change at this point in time,” said Sarma.The BJP’s strength in the assembly has been reduced to 18 after the resignation of three of its MLAs. However, it still enjoys the support of four NPF MLAs and an LJP legislator, taking the coalition’s tally to 23.Rival Congress , on the other hand, has 20 MLAs and also has the backing of four NPP MLAs and a lawmaker from the TMC and the Independent.In total, the Congress-led newly formed Secular Progressive Front (SPF) has 26 MLAs.Manipur Assembly’s strength has been reduced to 52 because of a few disqualifications and resignations.BJP’s candidate Sanajaoba Leishemba won the Rajya Sabha election last Friday securing 28 votes to Congress candidate T Mangibabu’s 24, despite the ruling party’s reduced strength, raising hopes of saving the coalition government.Meanwhile, NPP’s legislature party leader L Jayantakumar told journalists in Imphal that despite Himanta Biswa Sarma’s attempts at convincing them to return to the BJP-led coalition, they didn’t succumb.“Sarma tried his best to convince us but we never succumbed to his pressure. Our national president Conrad Sangma, who was present in the meeting, remained silent as left the decision on the what we should do to the 4 party MLAs,” Jayantakumar said during a press interaction of the SPF, which was attended by Congress MLAs as well.Earlier in the day Chief Minister N Biren Singh met Governor Najma Heptullah. In a tweet, he informed that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the RS elections and other issues of the state.“Why is the BJP running away from a floor test? If NEDA or BJP respects constitution then they should face a floor test in the House,” said Manipur Congress spokesperson Ningombam Bupenda Meitei.The Congress has met the Governor twice in the past few days seeking a floor test to prove majority of the N Biren Singh government.(With inputs from Sobhapati Samom in Imphal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-threat-to-manipur-govt-crisis-will-be-resolved-in-2-3-days-himanta-biswa-sarma/story-gOKvZZPn1nZqrZf1CzR0GI.html

The entire nation is delighted by the Supreme Court’s decision to ensure the Rath Yatra goes on,” Shah said after the top court’s judgment permitting the festival to take place.Earlier, the home minister also spoke to Gajapati Maharaj and the Shankaracharya of Puri to know their views on the Rath Yatra.ALSO READ | On Rath Yatra, Supreme Court says will let temple committee, Odisha decide“Considering the urgency and importance of the matter, it was placed in front of a vacation bench of the Supreme Court and the hearing took place this afternoon, which paved the way for the important decision by the SC. Congratulations to the people of Odisha,” Shah tweeted soon after the hearing on the issue. Four days after staying the historic and legendary Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra at Puri, the Supreme Court on Monday indicated it would allow the event, which is scheduled to start tomorrow, saying the court cannot ‘micro-manage’ the rituals and left it to the Odisha government, the Centre and the Lord Jagannath temple management to deal with the issue of social distancing and crowds of devotees..A bench headed by Chief Justice S A Bobde was told by the Odisha government that it will coordinate with the temple management and the Centre to ensure that things run smoothly during the Rath Yatra.The festival, held in the coastal state of Odisha is usually attended by lakhs of people from around the world. The court ordered the state government to ensure compliance with health protocols in view of the coronavirus pandemic.Earlier, while hearing a PIL filed by NGO ‘Odisha Vikash Parishad’ the top court on June 18 had said that in the interest of public health and safety, this year’s Puri Rath Yatra cannot be allowed and that “Lord Jagannath won’t forgive us if we allow” it. A day after the order was passed; a few applications were filed in the top court seeking recall and modification of its order.These applications, including those filed by the Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch and BJP leader Sambit Patra, urged the apex court to allow the Rath Yatra with certain restrictions in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/entire-nation-is-delighted-by-sc-s-nod-for-rath-yatra-in-puri-amit-shah/story-MhtuZb2p1WS5glExk5peKL.html

But by late in the night, we got a call from the hospital that she had passed away,” Nishat said.The family members were told that Begum Jani had tested negative for Covid-19 but when they went to the hospital the following morning, they were told that there was some mistake in the test report, as there was another patient of the same name in the hospital who got admitted June 17.The hospital authorities told Begum Jani’s family members that the sample from her body was sent for testing again and till the receipt of the report, her body would be kept in the mortuary.“For the three days, we were made to run around the hospital for the test report and finally, on Sunday night, we were told she had tested positive. As such, the body would not be given to the family members but would be buried as per Covid-19 rules,” Nishat said.The issue was brought to light on Monday by Mohd Amjadullah Khan, president of Majlis-e-Bachao-Tehreek who tweeted about the mix up of reports in the OGH.He said because of such mistakes there was every possibility that Covid-19 negative patients were disposed of by the GHMC authorities, while bodies Covid-19 positive patients were handed over to the relatives for last rites which was dangerous.OGH superintendent Dr B Nagender said such incidents rarely happen due to miscommunication and were addressed as soon as they were brought to the notice of the hospital authorities.“We come across some patients with the same name, coming from the same area for testing. When test reports are obtained from the lab at Osmania Medical College, sometimes, test reports of one patient might have been given to the family members of another patient due to miscommunication as the names sound similar,” he said.Nagender, however, said enough care would be taken while handing over the bodies to the relatives, which would be done only after cross-checking the telephone numbers, Aadhar cards and other details.He acknowledged that there was delay in obtaining test reports from the lab and attributed it to the growing number of cases in Hyderabad. “We are making the best efforts to get the results as early as possible,” the OGH superintendent said.A similar mistake took place at the OGH on Sunday, too, when family members of a woman who was under treatment at the hospital were told that she had died due to Covid-19, though they were told a day before that she was recovering fast and was healthy.When the family members reached the hospital, they saw that Meherunissa was present in her ward and they lodged a complaint with the police. During the inquiry, it was revealed that another patient by the same name died due to Covid-19 and the hospital staff called up the family members of the other patient who was recovering. The hospital authorities apologised to the family.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hyderabad-hospital-declares-woman-covid-19-free-then-says-she-died-of-it/story-vh1SlEf768lt5Su6xDw2vL.html

There is an orange category warning for Assam, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura along with some parts of sub-Himalayan West Bengal and Bihar for these three days for very heavy to extremely heavy rains, IMD said on Monday. An orange warning implies that authorities will have to be prepared for rain-related emergencies.A trough of low pressure currently runs from north Punjab to northwest Bay of Bengal. Its eastern end is very likely to shift northward from June 24. The convergence of strong moist southerlies and southwesterly winds from the Bay of Bengal over northeast and east India is likely to make conditions conducive for extremely heavy rains, IMD said.There is also a cyclonic circulation over north interior Odisha, which is likely to move northwestwards during next three days. “Under the influence of the above meteorological features, conditions are becoming favourable for further advance of monsoon into some more parts of Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand during the next 24 hours and into the entire Western Himalayan Region, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, most parts of Punjab…during the subsequent 48 hours.” IMD’s bulletin said.Due to the approaching monsoon, there is also likely to be widespread rains over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and the Western Himalayan region from June 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/intense-monsoon-spell-likely-over-ne-india-imd/story-WVK4Xnj0aqXnRMfYS2W96I.html

On Monday, the Congress leader wanted to know why is China busy praising Prime Minister Narendra Modi amid tension in bilateral ties and fight over the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the Galwan area. “China killed our soldiers. China took our land. Then, why is China praising Mr Modi during this conflict?” asked Gandhi, tagging a news report detailing how Chinese social media welcomed the PM’s comments on the border meet at Friday’s all-party meet. China killed our soldiers.China took our land.Then, why is China praising Mr Modi during this conflict? pic.twitter.com/iNV8c1cmalAt the meeting called to discuss the border situation with China, the PM categorically pointed out that “neither has anyone entered Indian territory, nor is anyone present in Indian territory currently, and nor is any Indian post captured”. This led to howls of protest from the opposition seeking an explanation as to how the soldiers died on June 15. A day later, on Saturday, in a clarification, the Prime Minister’s Office said Modi’s remarks had focused on the June 15 face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers at Galwan that led to the loss of lives of 20 Indian soldiers.“The Prime Minister’s observations that there was no Chinese presence on our side of the LAC (Line of Actual Control) pertained to the situation as a consequence of the bravery of our armed forces,” the statement said.Rahul Gandhi shared The Hindu’s report which, in turn, quoted China’s state-run Global Times report quoting PM’s no one has entered Indian territory comment. The same comment, the paper noted, was then picked up by other outlets and shared on social media as well. Quoting a Chinese military expert, the paper said: “The PM’s comments on the armed forces being allowed to take necessary steps was “a show of strength for domestic audiences to appease the Indian masses and boost the Indian troops’ morale”.On Sunday, Rahul Gandhi emerged as one of the top trends on Twitter when he, in a post, said “Narendra Modi is actually Surender Modi”.The apparent reference was to Indian territory being ceded to the Chinese. A top retired army commander, who didn’t want to be identified, told HT that China had already achieved what it set out to achieve – gaining control over Galwan Valley and the strategic feature Finger 4 near Pangong Tso where a significant Chinese build up has taken place over the last six weeks.The government, however, denies any such claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-wonders-why-is-china-praising-pm-modi-amid-border-conflict/story-JMOB0DUHlT75ym5EMwDXMP.html

He had boarded the train on Sunday afternoon from Ghaziabad. Midway through the journey, the person, whose sample was taken in Noida, got a message on his phone that he had tested positive for Covid-19.Though the person instantly informed Covid-19 control room through a toll-free number, co-passengers panicked and kept their distance from him.The incident sparked outrage over the fact that the person was allowed to travel before his results of his test was declared.“It is being communicated to the respective authorities of Ghaziabad in Uttar Pradesh, as to how the person was allowed to board the train when he ought to have been in quarantine,” Station house officer Government Railway Police (GRP) Haridwar Anuj Singh said.He also said that according to the person his sample was collected at the company’s factory itself so there is also the question why he was allowed by company management and local authorities to travel interstate when he should have been quarantined till the sample report came.Chief medical officer Dr Saroj Naithani said that the particular passenger has been shifted to Covid-19 isolation center at Mela hospital while other co-passengers in the same coach have been quarantined in a government facility after the train arrived in the evening.“GRP personnel informed the health department about the passenger being Covid-19 positive and immediately a team was sent to the railway station.

22-06-2020||India||Pollutants enter Delhi via three distinct air corridors during winters: Study||Scientists have identified at least three distinct air corridors that act as carriers of pollutants to Delhi from places far and wide, including Nepal in the east, and Iran and Pakistan in the north-west, during winter, when the national capital’s air quality is at its worst.The study -- the first real-time source apportionment analysis of Delhi, as the data was collected once every 30 minutes during two successive winters in 2018 and 2019 -- was conducted by a team of 15 researchers from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur; IIT-Delhi; Laboratory of Atmospheric Chemistry (LAC), Switzerland; Physical Research Laboratory; Ahmedabad; and Laboratoire des Sciences du Climat et de l’environnement, France.The samples from the study were collected from the campus of IIT-Delhi.“Contrary to the popular belief, we’ve found that pollutants enter Delhi through three distinct corridors during winter. While the north-west corridor primarily brings pollutants from Pakistan, Punjab and Haryana; Uttar Pradesh makes up for the north-east and the east; and Nepal, too, accounts for the east,” said SN Tripathi, head, civil engineering department, IIT-Kanpur, and one of the authors of the study.A joint study -- conducted by The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) and Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI) two years ago -- had shown that 64% of Delhi’s pollution is extraneous.Around 34% of the pollutants traced their origins to the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) and 18% from the north-western parts of the country. While 13% of pollutants were from other parts of south Asia and beyond.The latest study showed that in each of these corridors, some specific chemicals were found in the air in much higher quantity, which suggested that certain industries were the worst polluters.“Winds coming from the east were found to be carrying metals such as lead, copper and cadmium because of the presence of lead-based industries in the region. Similarly, elements such as selenium, bromine and chlorine were found to be predominant in winds blowing from the north-west sector. While selenium and bromine were found in industries dealing with drugs and chemicals among others, and chlorine emitted from brick kilns, landfill sites that burnt garbage and other factories,” he added.The scientists detected at least 35 elements of which 26 were found in higher quantity than the rest, making up nearly one-fourth of the total mass of the coarser particles, known as particulate matter 10 (PM10). “The study was a real-time source apportionment analysis, as the data was collected once every 30 minutes. We also found that Delhi is in the grips of pollution peaks twice daily. The first peak occurs between 3am and 8am the next one around 10pm,” said Dilip Ganguly, associate professor, Centre for Atmospheric Studies, IIT-Delhi.Dr. Prashant Gargava, member-secretary, Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the country’s apex pollution control body, said: “This was a research & development (R&D) project, which was commissioned by the CPCB. It has provided some high-resolution data. We’ll analyse the data after we receive a complete report to utilise them for further policymaking decisions.”“The study could open new vistas for air quality management in the country.

22-06-2020||India||China’s blame narrative continues, says India ‘initiated’ Galwan clash||India initiated the violent clash in eastern Ladakh last week, China said on Monday continuing to blame New Delhi for the face-off in Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh, which left 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number of Chinese troops dead in a vicious hand-to-hand brawl on the night of June 15.“The rights and wrongs of this incident are very clear,” Beijing said in a statement to the Hindustan Times.At the regular briefing on Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry also refused to share any details of the ongoing military-to-military talks in the region, and, once again, stalled a query on the number of casualties that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) suffered.“China and India are in communication with each other to resolve the situation on the ground through diplomatic and military channels. I have no information to release on that,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said.Zhao’s comment was in response to a query on Indian minister V K Singh’s statement on Sunday in which he said China could have lost double the number of soldiers India lost in the violent clash.The Chinese government has refused to reveal PLA’s casualty figures for a week now though Chinese state-controlled media has said both sides suffered casualties during the clash.In a separate statement to the Hindustan Times on Monday, the spokesperson’s office reiterated its stance on the cause of the clash.“The Chinese has repeatedly stated that the rights and wrongs of this incident are very clear and initiated by the Indian side, and the responsibility does not rest with China,” the spokesperson’s office said in a written statement in Mandarin to the Hindustan Times on Monday.“China always strictly abides by the agreements signed between the two countries and carries out patrols and duties on the Chinese side of the line of actual control (LAC),” the statement said.The statement added that Beijing hopes that the two sides will “…earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, step up communication and coordination on properly handling the border situation and jointly safeguard peace and tranquility of the border area”.The latest statement from the Chinese foreign ministry continues from the so-called step-by-step account of the clash it released late on Friday night.As a background to the account – which has been rubbished by India – the ministry claimed “…Galwan Valley is located on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control in the west section of the China-India boundary.”“For many years, the Chinese border troops have been patrolling and on duty in this region. Since April this year, the Indian border troops have unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities at the LAC in the Galwan Valley,” the statement said.“Shockingly, on the evening of June 15, India’s front-line troops, in violation of the agreement reached at the commander-level meeting, once again crossed the LAC for deliberate provocation when the situation in the Galwan Valley was already easing, and even violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went there for negotiation, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties.”Soon after China released this statement on Friday, India rejected the claims of China’s sovereignty over Galwan Valley, calling them “exaggerated and untenable”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-s-blame-narrative-continues-says-india-initiated-galwan-clash/story-mQQnpVKeDpOzxqhUo7bGbP.html

A fun series by photographer Guru Charan shows the superhero chopping onions and washing clothes! If the guy that can leap across continents can take these responsibilities, so can you!The toy photographer says, “I travelled from Bengaluru to my village Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh for a function and got stuck here when the lockdown was announced. My 7-month’s old toy sets came to my rescue and I started shooting these incredible heroes with my kid’s clothes.”Some days back, the toymaker Mattel had also launched #ThankYouHeroes collection which included 16 action figures - four each of doctors, nurses, EMTs and delivery drivers in varying genders and skin tones.The world has been honouring healthcare heroes but this tribute is a tad different as it has ‘Hulk’. Guru says,”This is my small tribute to all people who are working at home and ensuring that everything works smoothly. While shooting these heroes, I realised Hulk was the most sturdy toy among all the other toys. So I thought of shooting him with my uncle’s lungi as well.”The 33-year old says, “After much introspection, I came to a realisation that with the lockdown, even the superheroes at home would be doing the same household chores which all of us have been doing. Life for all has become about sweeping the floor, washing and ironing the clothes, cooking and entertaining kids. For Hulk, it is also about staying at home and staying safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-hulk-on-your-side-you-re-worrying-about-covid-19/story-Sc7tCU8fjD5zC8zSewFrzI.html

They’re writing to MEA after the monsoon has arrived. The entire northern part of state is in danger of getting flooded,” ANI quoted Tejashwi Yadav as saying after the state’s minister for water resources Sanjay Jha said he will sound out the ministry of external affairs about Nepal’s obstruction to flood prevention-related works.Jha had warned that if the issue is not addressed timely then a major part of the state will be flooded.“Our local engineers and DM are in talks with concerned authorities and now I’ll write a letter to the Ministry of External Affairs, over the current situation. If this issue isn’t addressed timely, then a major part of Bihar will be flooded,” Jha said according to ANI.This situation on the Indo-Nepal border has been tense after the country laid claim to Indian territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in Uttarakhand.Earlier this month, the Nepalese Parliament passed a constitutional amendment to show the disputed areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepal.On June 12, an Indian man was killed and four others were injured after Nepalese police allegedly fired indiscriminately on them at the border near Sitamarhi district in Bihar.The firing took place after a clash between the Indians and personnel of Nepal police at the Lalbandi-Janki Nagar border in Pipra Parsain panchayat under Sonebarsha police station of the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tejashwi-yadav-blames-bihar-govt-as-flood-threat-looms-amid-border-dispute-with-nepal/story-zrZkw7ivY16m2CE9wSxE2J.html
22-06-2020||India||Safoora Zargar was one of main conspirators, pregnancy no ground for bail: Delhi Police tells court||Delhi Police informed the Delhi high court on Monday that Safoora Zargar, charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for her alleged role in the northeast Delhi riots, was part of a conspiracy to use any means to cause death and injury to people. The police made its submission in a reply to the court, which will hear the matter again on Tuesday. Zargar, a MPhil student of Jamia Millia Islamia, was arrested on April 10 for allegedly conspiring with other persons to instigate and start riots in northeast Delhi. At least 53 people died and 400 others were injured in the riots in February. In a status report, Delhi Police said that based on an investigation, a case was clearly made out from the statements of witnesses. While describing Zargar as one of the “main conspirators and the instigator”, police said the statements of witnesses were allegedly corroborated by her admissions and “extensive documentary evidence”. Opposing her bail application, police said Zargar and other accused were allegedly involved in a “web of actions animated by unlawful object of creating terror and disaffection”.Police told the court that Zargar’s “protestations of innocence are phony; her actions are neither licit nor legitimate and she is clearly culpable of criminal wrongs of grave magnitude deserving no indulgence from the court”. Many student groups across Delhi have held protests seeking Zargar’s release. Students bodies and activists have accused Delhi Police of launching a witch hunt against student activists, especially those who took part in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Zargar earlier told the court she was only part of the protests and denied the police allegations. Delhi Police submitted the status report after Zargar approached the court, seeking bail on the ground that she is more than four months pregnant and has severe medical complications. Replying to this, police said that their “record reveals a sinister stratagem” and Zargar was not only disposed towards “creating turmoil to severely undermine public order and imperil national security but erode and frustrate the civil compact which holds our polity together”.Police said that prima facie, a case has been made against Zargar after her WhatsApp chats were analysed by the investigating agency.The investigating agency said Zargar is not entitled to bail on the ground of pregnancy as the law does not make any distinction in this regard. Police told the court that Delhi’s jails have had many pregnant inmates. They said in that in the past 10 years, 39 deliveries have taken place inside prison.“It is stated that the law unambiguously contemplates provisions to deal with pregnant criminals, which itself indicates that the law permits use of sanction against this class of offenders. The severity of offence is in no manner mitigated by the factum of pregnancy, the accused is not the only pregnant accused to be entitled to any preferential treatment and there is enough precedence available in law not only of the arrest of the pregnant accused and their detention but even of delivery in prison….,” police said.Police earlier said that Zargar, currently being held in Tihar Jail, had allegedly blocked a road near Jafrabad Metro station during the anti-CAA protests and instigated people, which led to riots in the area. On June 4, a city court dismissed her bail plea, stating that “right of speech and expression and for that matter protest or demonstration, is not an absolute right and subject to reasonable restrictions under the Indian Constitution”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/safoora-zargar-was-one-of-main-conspirators-pregnancy-no-ground-for-bail-delhi-police-tells-court/story-4mY5SWUL4vW1P2EBmpjLiI.html

The state police also seized 83,970 vehicles and collected ₹8.41 crore in fines from offenders.While strictly implementing the lockdown, the police came face to face with many citizens who didn’t follow the rules and several places in Maharashtra witnessed clashes between police and citizens. In such situations, police carried out what officials said were mild baton charges, and many police personnel were wounded.Assistant inspector general of police (law and order) Vinayak Deshmukh said on Monday that were 277 instances of police parties being attacked since the lockdown began, in which 858 personnel were injured.Police believe citizens have now become aware of the pandemic and are alerting authorities if they see any person violating the lockdown as such actions raise the possibility of the disease spreading. As a result, there has been a steady rise in the number of Covid-19-related calls on the police helpline number 100. Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh tweeted on Monday that 104,040 calls had been received at the state police control room. Police say they are keeping a close eye on those who are venturing out despite being placed in home quarantine by the local administration. A total of 6,26,353 people have been quarantined across Maharashtra and 793 of them were found violating the quarantine.Meanwhile, one more policeman from Mumbai has died of Covid-19, taking the death toll among Maharashtra Police personnel to 49. The death toll among police personnel in Mumbai has risen to 33. The policeman who died was identified as constable Pradip Quashid, 53. He was attached to the protection and security branch. Quashid was a resident of Gurgaon and had tested positive for Covid-19 on June 17. He was initially treated at J J Hospital, and was recently shifted to St George’s Hospital. He was put on ventilator after developing serious breathing problems but succumbed to the disease on Sunday night. Quashid was survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter. Deputy commissioner of police (protection) Prashant Kadam confirmed the death. So far, 4,048 police personnel in the state have been infected with the virus, mainly while on duty in high-risk containment zones. Most of these personnel are from Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nasik, Nagpur and Malegaon and SRPF.To de-stress policemen, SRPF personnel were deployed in urban areas where the maximum number of Covid-19 cases were reported. They were moved to these places to assist local police in enforcing the lockdown.However, many SRPF personnel also got infected. On Sunday, SRPF reported its first casualty - a company commander who died in Mumbai. So far, a total of 741 SRPF personnel have tested positive for Covid-19, and 648 of them have been discharged from hospital after recovering.Vinakay Deshmukh said many of the infected police personnel have recovered and only around 1,000 are active now. Most of these policemen are from Mumbai Police. Deshmukh said the police department has successfully cut the spread of Covid-19 among police personnel through multiple preventive and precautionary measures. Police personnel are now aware and more concerned about their personal safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/133-730-firs-registered-27-446-arrested-for-violating-covid-19-lockdown-in-maharashtra/story-a1ZsdBTH5wlHGZdbo7sNLK.html

In a message posted on Twitter, Nadda said, “Please stop insulting of forces repeatedly, questioning their valour. You did this post the air strikes and surgical strikes. Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times.It’s never too late to improve.” Dear Dr. Singh and Congress Party,Please stop insulting our forces repeatedly, questioning their valour. You did this post the air strikes and surgical strikes. Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times. It’s never too late to improve.The tweet was a reaction to a statement by Singh about the violent face-off between Indian and the Chinese troops in Ladakh on June 15 in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should always be mindful of the implications of his words, a reference to the controversy stocked by Modi’s comments at a meeting of all political parties on Friday. The former prime minister also said the government must rise to the occasion to ensure justice for Col B Santhosh Babu and the 19 other soldiers killed in action. The BJP reacted by accusing the Congress of politicising the issue.“One only wishes that Dr Singh was as worried about Chinese designs when, as PM, he abjectly surrender hundred square kilometres of India’s land to China. He presided over 600 incursions made by China between 2010 to 2013!” Nadda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/stop-repeatedly-insulting-the-security-forces-and-questioning-their-valour-nadda-to-manmohan-singh/story-8E2HjDn3UvqbBVPpIMSXzN.html

And notwithstanding her maintaining stealth and secrecy about her real designs the available circumstantial evidence clearly demonstrates that a protestation of innocence is phony, her actions are neither licit nor legitimate and she is clearly culpable of criminal wrongs or grave magnitude deserving no indulgence from this court,” the status report said.“It is also extremely crucial to note here that direct evidence is not always available of a conspiratorial design and mere absence of a contemporaneous record does not even remotely suggest the absence of a case against the applicant/ accused because she stands clearly implicated by the evidence which stands unearthed by the investigation which is continuing even now and further trails of criminality is being unearthed,” it added.The status report said that there is substantial cause for the arrest of the applicant and added that there are grave and compelling reasons that she remains in custody.“Unless evidence in rebuttal is presented (which can only be at trial) she cannot claim to be innocent of the acquisition made against her, as alleged or otherwise, in her petition,” Delhi Police said in the status report.Safoora Zargar had moved the High Court challenging an order of a trial court in Delhi, which had dismissed her bail application.In the mid of February, the accused had allegedly planned to observe protests in various parts of north-east Delhi. She also took part in a protest and blocked a road near a Jafrabad metro station.Later, violence had broken out between groups supporting and opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA), which led to the deaths of at least 53 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/safoora-zargar-created-turmoil-imperiled-national-security-police-on-bail-plea-in-delhi-violence-case/story-WLHVnQv3QCl5tWulUPXa4J.html

Kejriwal said that on June 12, 5,300 beds across national capital were occupied by Covid-19 and the figure rose 6,200 as of today.

This indicates that there are fewer severe cases and most get better by getting treated in home-isolation, the situation seems to be stabilizing,” he said. The chief minister added that at present, 7,000 beds are still unoccupied and ready for Covid-19 patients. The chief minister thanked the Central government for its help in battling the Covid-19 fight in Delhi and said that the two governments are working closely to fight the crisis.“This is no time to harp on differences or indulge in politics,” he said. Also read: ‘Fighting 2 wars against China, will win them both’ - Arvind Kejriwal on Covid-19 fightHere are the highlights from Kejriwal’s address: • We are trying to control coronavirus from spreading in the national capital at the same time trying to arrange facilities for those who contract the virus. • Our administration is constantly in touch with those who are getting treated for Covid-19 at home, guiding them on what to do next.• The administration of oxygen is very critical in Covid-19 patients when their oxygen levels drop or when they feel breathless. If patients receive oxygen in time, many patients can be saved. For this purpose, we will provide pulse oximeters to measure oxygen levels every few hours. • Patients in home-isolation can monitor their oxygen level and in case of drop, they can call on a number that we will provide and our team will immediately visit and administer oxygen to the patient. The patient will be rushed to the hospital if there is a requirement. • At present, Delhi has nearly 25,000 active cases of coronavirus while around 33,000 people have recovered from the contagion. • Around 6,000 people are currently in hospitals getting treated for coronavirus while nearly 12,000 are under home quarantine and getting treated for Covid-19. •Just a week back, Delhi had 24,000 active cases of coronavirus which means that fresh 1,000 cases have been reported. It indicates that while new cases are coming up, people are also getting cured from the disease. Seems like the situation is stabilizing. • We have more than tripled the rate of our Covid-19 testing in the past days. From around 5,000 tests per day, the figure has gone up to 18,000 tests. • We have taken strict action against unscrupulous labs who were showing incorrect test results. They have directed to work in a fair manner and in full capacity. • With the help of the Central government, rapid tests have also started in the national capital. I feel people should not feel any problems in getting tested for Covid-19 now. Coronavirus cases in Delhi now inch toward the 60,000-mark. The national capital has 59,746 positive cases with 33,013 recovered patients and 2,175 fatalities. With this, it has overtaken Tamil Nadu as the second worst-hit state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-testing-more-than-tripled-in-delhi-situation-seems-to-stabilize-highlights-of-delhi-cm-kejriwal-s-address/story-yyOZkSTGsrqfP5rvZiOMBO.html

During the UPA years saw abject strategic and territorial surrender without a fight. Time and again belittles our forces,” Nadda said on Twitter. Dr. Manmohan Singh belongs to the same party which: Helplessly surrendered over 43,000 KM of Indian territory to the Chinese!During the UPA years saw abject strategic and territorial surrender without a fight.Time and again belittles our forces.He went on: “One only wishes that Dr Singh was as worried about Chinese designs when, as PM, he abjectly surrendered hundreds of square kilometres of India’s land to China. He presided over 600 incursions made by China between 2010 to 2013!”“Dr Manmohan Singh can certainly share his wisdom on many subjects but the responsibilities of the office of the Prime Minister isn’t one of them. UPA personified systematic institutional erosion of that office, combined with disrespect for our armed forces. NDA has reversed that!” the BJP chief said in his third tweet.And finally, he said: “Dear Dr Singh and Congress Party, please stop insulting our forces repeatedly, questioning their valour. You did this post the air strikes and surgical strikes. Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times. It’s never too late to improve.” Dear Dr. Singh and Congress Party,Please stop insulting our forces repeatedly, questioning their valour. You did this post the air strikes and surgical strikes. Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times. It’s never too late to improve.In his first remarks since the face-off on June 15, Dr Singh had said that China is brazenly and illegally seeking to claim parts of Indian territory by committing multiple incursions from April onwards.“We cannot and will not be cowed down by threats and intimidation nor permit a compromise with our territorial integrity,” he said.Dr Singh’s statement furthers the attack launched by the Congress party since the June 15 skirmish. It has questioned if the Chinese have captured parts of Indian territory.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said at an all-party meeting called on the issue that there are no Chinese troops on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and no Indian posts have been captured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/presided-over-600-incursions-bjp-chief-nadda-hits-back-at-manmohan-singh-for-ladakh-face-off-remarks/story-SGUfC61hNwBSCVgynlFBJO.html

The injured are being treated at SN Hospital in Agra.“The accident took place at 2 am on Monday when the truck was coming from Lucknow towards Agra. It appears that driver either slept while driving or for other reason could not control the truck which struck the divider and came on wrong side - on road towards Lucknow - and turned turtle. A bus coming from Delhi and heading towards Lucknow collided with the truck,” said Pradeep Kumar, the in-charge of Doki police station in Agra district.“The person who was killed is either the driver or the cleaner of the truck. About 14 passengers of the bus got injured when it turned and fell towards railing alongside the ExpreswWay,” said Kumar.“Out of the 14 injured, six were admitted at emergency ward of SN Medical College and Hospital of Agra and are under treatment.

The dead body from the truck was removed and sent for post-mortem,” he added.The police added that the truck has been removed and road cleared for traffic movement.Since the lockdown relaxations have come into force, traffic has increased on the Agra-Lucknow Expressway and this was the third accident in three consecutive days on 302 kilometre long road.On Saturday, five members of a family were killed when their car rammed into truck near Naseerpur village in Firozabad district.On Sunday, a private bus from Gorakhpur heading towards Jaipur collided with the railing on the side of the Expressway leaving four injured.On Monday, a truck driver was killed when a bus collided with it in Doki area of Agra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-killed-more-than-dozen-injured-after-bus-collides-with-truck-near-agra/story-aqkpfajBTt2WWmsarcw3QI.html
22-06-2020||India||Centre moves SC, seeks nod for Puri Rath Yatra without public participation||The Centre on Monday told the Supreme Court that Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra in Puri can be allowed to be held this year without public participation in view of the coronavirus pandemic, saying the “tradition of centuries may not be stopped”. The Odisha government also supported the Centre’s stand in the apex court, which is likely to hear the plea seeking modification of its June 18 order staying this year’s Puri Rath Yatra due to the Covid-19 pandemic.“It is a matter of faith for crores. If Lord Jagannath will not come out tomorrow, he cannot come out for 12 years as per traditions,” Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who mentioned the matter before a bench headed by Justice Arun Mishra, said.Mehta said that besides maintaining precautions, the state government can impose curfew for a day.“All ‘sebayats’ and ‘pandas’ who have tested negative (for Covid-19) can participate in rituals as may be decided by HH Shri Shankaracharya. People may not congregate and seek blessings on TV during live telecast. Raja of Puri and the temple committee may supervise arrangements of these rituals,” Mehta told the bench.The Puri Rath Yatra, which is attended by lakhs of people from across the world, is scheduled from June 23.The apex court had on June 18 said that in the interest of public health and safety of citizens, this year’s Puri Rath Yatra cannot be allowed and that “Lord Jagannath won’t forgive us if we allow” it. A day after the order was passed, some applications were filed in the top court seeking recall and modification of its order. The modification applications filed earlier are already listed today before a single judge bench of Justice S Ravindra Bhat.These applications, including the one filed by ‘Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch’, have urged the court to allow the Rath Yatra.While the Rath Yatra festival, held over 10-12 days with lakhs of people participating, was scheduled for June 23, the ‘Bahuda Jatra’ (return car festival) was fixed for July 1.Three heavily-built wooden chariots of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Devi Subhadra are traditionally pulled by thousands of devotees over a distance of three kilometres twice during the nine-day festival of the Trinity at Puri.The application filed by ‘Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch’ has sought modification of the June 18 order, saying the festival is deeply associated with the religious beliefs of millions of devotees of Lord Jagannath and it is “not impossible and impracticable” for the state and district administration to conduct the yatra by maintaining social distancing and following the Centre’s guidelines.Besides this, a separate application seeking modification of the June 18 order has been filed by one Aftab Hossen, who has said that “as per the ritual of Lord Jagannath, the Rath Yatra is performed every year and if one year it is not performed, same cannot be performed for the next 12 years”.Hossen, while urging the apex court to modify its order and allow the Rath Yatra, has said in his application that restraining the Rath Yatra this year would practically mean restraining it for the next 12 years and this could create “great repercussion and chaos” in the Lord Jagannath culture and rituals.In its separate application, the ‘Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Manch’ has said that as per the earlier direction of the Orissa High Court as well as decision of the state government, 372 people were engaged in the construction of three raths/chariots for more than one-and-half months and all were isolated, tested and found Covid-19 negative. The top court’s June 18 order had came on a PIL filed by an Odisha-based NGO seeking cancellation or postponement of this year’s yatra.Two pleas were filed in the apex court seeking cancellation or postponement of the historic yatra.Besides the PIL filed by NGO ‘Odisha Vikas Parishad’, seeking stay on holding of the annual festival, an appeal has been filed by one Surendra Panigrahi of ‘Bhartiya Bikash Parishad’ against the Orissa High Court order of June 9, which had asked the state government to decide on holding the yatra in line with the Covid-19 guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-moves-sc-seeks-nod-for-puri-rath-yatra-without-public-participation/story-qc7sEaUkPVhNWUiHAZc8xI.html

He prayed that the Rath Yatra should be allowed to be held without public participation. Patra submitted that the Rath Yatra can be conducted by employing the services of Lord Jagannath’s 800 sevayats, who are persons who perform the ritual services of Lord Jagannath and other deities at the Puri Jagannath temple.Patra was hospitalised after he showed coronavirus symptoms and later discharged.The court had last Thursday stayed the annual event and associated activities at the Jagannath Temple in Odisha’s Puri in the wake of coronavirus pandemic. The yatra is scheduled to commence from June 23.The court order came on a petition filed by an NGO which had pointed out the health risk involved if the Rath Yatra is allowed at a time when Covid-19 is spreading rapidly across the country.The NGO referred to the Tablighi Jamaat incident which was Muslim religious congregation held in mid-March at Nizamuddin area in Delhi resulting in a spurt in Covid-19 cases across the country after people from various parts of India and even foreign countries attended the event.The Rath Yatra festival lasts for 10 to 12 days and involves a procession of chariots containing the deities Lord Jagannatha, his brother Lord Balabhadra and sister Devi Subhadra. The crowd pulling the chariots is very close to each other, which violates the social distancing norms during the times of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/allow-rath-yatra-without-public-participation-supreme-court-hears-plea/story-AtSqUdmlUpukwhOU4h7qkI.html
22-06-2020||India||PM must be mindful of implications of his words: Manmohan Singh on Ladakh face-off||In his first remarks on the Ladakh face-off, former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Monday said PM Narendra Modi must be mindful of the implications of his words and cannot allow China to use them as a vindication of its position.Noting that disinformation is no substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership, Singh called upon the prime minister to ensure justice for soldiers who died defending India’s territorial integrity.“To do any less would be a historic betrayal of people’s faith,” he said in a statement. The Congress has been attacking the government on Prime Minister Modi’s remarks at an all-party meeting that no one has entered Indian territory or captured any military post while referring to the eastern Ladakh standoff. The government has, however, said that attempts are being made to give a “mischievous interpretation” to the prime minister’s remarks. Singh said this is a moment where we must stand together as a nation and be united in our response to this brazen threat. Twenty Indian soldiers, including a colonel, were killed in the violent face-off with Chinese troops on the night of June 15/16 in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.Noting that the country is standing at the historic cross-roads, Singh said the government’s decisions and actions will have serious bearings on how the future generations perceive us.“Those who lead us bear the weight of a solemn duty. And in our democracy that responsibility rests with the office of the prime minister,” he said.“The prime minister must always be mindful of the implications of his words and declarations on our nation’s security as also strategic and territorial interests,” he said.The Congress veteran said China is “brazenly and illegally” seeking to claim parts of Indian territory such as the Galwan Valley and the Pangong Tso Lake by committing multiple incursions from April 2020 till date. “We cannot and will not be cowed down by threats and intimidation nor permit a compromise with our territorial integrity. “The Prime Minister cannot allow them to use his words as a vindication of their position and must ensure that all organs of the Government work together to tackle this crisis and prevent it from escalating further,” he said.  “We remind the Government that disinformation is no substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership. The truth cannot be suppressed by having pliant allies spout comforting but false statements,” he said. Singh also said that the sacrifice of soldiers cannot be allowed to go in vain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-must-be-mindful-of-implications-of-his-words-manmohan-singh-on-ladakh-face-off/story-oDVFHW7IFqzBwdbFbNi4CM.html

Unlike the PLA which moves in infantry combat vehicles and paved metalled roads to move, the Indian mountain troops are trained in guerrilla warfare and fighting in high altitude as shown by them in Kargil War. Also Watch | Can India fight war on two fronts with China & Pakistan? Gen VP Malik answers“The art of mountain fighting is the toughest as the cost of human casualties is 10 to each troop of the adversary sitting on a height. The troops from Uttarakhand, Ladakh, Gorkha, Arunachal and Sikkim have adapted to the rarefied heights over centuries and hence their capability of fighting is close quarter combats is without match. The artillery and the missiles have to have pin-pointed accuracy or else they miss the mountain target by miles,” said a former Indian Army chief.The other thing that works for the army is that the Tibetan plateau is flat on the Chinese side while the Indian side starts from K2 peak in Karakoram, to Nanda Devi in Uttarakhand, to Kanchenjung in Sikkim and Namche Barwa across Arunachal Pradesh border. “In mountains, it is not only difficult to capture territory but more difficult to hold it,” a China expert with South Block said. While India has noted with appreciation the voices coming out in its support from the Trump administration, including the President himself, the mood in Delhi is more like “atmanirbhar (self-reliant) Bharat” with no intent of asking anyone for military or diplomatic support. “I have my battalions lined up with armoured personnel carriers and artillery. India will not instigate or precipitate any skirmish but will reply to any transgression. The days of LAC nibbling are over. This is a battle of nerves and India is prepared to wait, come snow come sunshine,” said a senior minister.The Modi government is very unhappy that the Chinese President Xi Jinping broke all the “peace and tranquility” promises by not reining his favourite PLA western theatre commander Gen Zhao Zongqi, who is insistent on imposing 1960 eastern Ladakh map based on exaggerated territorial claims on India. This map where China claims territory upto Kongka La was unveiled by then Chinese premier Chou En Lai.Incidentally, Chou En Lai, the premier during 1962 conflict, had close links with President Xi Jinping’s family and Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s wife is the daughter of secretary of the former premier. External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar father K Subrahmanyam was involved in India’s war effort as an officer in the Defence Ministry.It was only to set aside these historical baggage that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had initiated the Wuhan and Chennai understandings so that the two leaders could promote the bilateral relations post-Doklam. It is quite evident that President Xi had no such plans and has used tensions in East Ladakh to divert global attention from failure of China to alert the world about coronavirus. In the same way, another paramount leader used the 1962 conflict to deflect attention from the famine, due to failure of Great Leap Forward movement, in which millions of Chinese died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-deploys-specialised-mountain-forces-to-check-china-s-transgressions-along-lac/story-ABqjJToNSziO1QGfsCtPOI.html

They laid down their lives in the ultimate act of sacrifice, valour and duty to our country. Our brave hearts defended the motherland till their last breath and for that we owe them, and their families, our eternal gratitude,” Singh said.Also read: Rajnath Singh meets chiefs, says keep strict vigil along LACTheir sacrifice cannot be allowed to be in vain, the senior Congress leader asserted.The Congress has been repeatedly asking the government to be transparent on the standoff and inform the nation about Chinese transgressions.Modi recently said there are no Chinese troops on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and no Indian posts have been captured. Singh said, “At this moment, we stand at historic cross-roads. Our government’s decisions and actions will have serious bearings on how the future generations perceive us. Those who lead us bear the weight of a solemn duty.”He added, “And in our democracy that responsibility rests with the office of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister must always be mindful of the implications of his words and declarations on our nation’s security as also strategic and territorial interests.”Singh further said the Prime Minister cannot allow the Chinese to use his words as a vindication of their position and must ensure that all organs of the government work together to tackle this crisis and prevent it from escalating.“This is a moment where we must stand together as a nation and be united in our response to this brazen threat,” he said.Also read: Some states plan to cancel contracts with Chinese firms“We remind the government that disinformation is no substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership. The truth cannot be suppressed by having pliant allies spout comforting but false statements,” Singh said.Indian and Chinese border troops have been engaged in a months-old border standoff, with the Galwan Valley in Ladakh the focus of tensions. The situation was exacerbated by a violent clash on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.

Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Jharsuguda district collector Saroj Kumar Samal said all the 17 had attended a birthday party and a wedding anniversary celebration in the last fortnight in which a Covid-19 positive woman also took part.“On June 14, a woman who had returned from Gurgaon with her husband and son had tested positive. The woman staying at her uncle’s house in Brajrajnagar OMP area of Jharsuguda was supposed to stay in isolation for 14 days and adhere to all the protocols of home quarantine,” said the district collector.“However, she had organised a birthday party of her son while being in home quarantine that was attended by her neighbours. Later, she also attended a wedding anniversary celebration in her neighbourhood and ended up infecting 17 people,” Samal added.Incidentally, the woman had organised the birthday party even as the area where she stayed was declared a containment zone.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “We have lodged a complaint against the heads of the two families under Section 15 of the Disaster Management Act and Sections 296, 271 and 188 of IPC. Despite our warnings, people are not heeding to our advice on home quarantine,” said the district collector.“Our district was much better until this case happened. We would not hesitate to take strict action against people who violate home quarantine conditions,” he said.The infection in Jharsuguda came on the day Odisha saw 304 new cases, the highest single-day spike taking the infection tally to 5,160. Last month, a 55-year-old trader from Koraput district under quarantine and found Covid-19 positive had jumped home quarantine by travelling to Andhra Pradesh. When health officials went to his house to bring him to the hospital, they were told that he had left for Andhra Pradesh to attend the funeral of his sister. His contact tracing revealed that he has come in contact with 28 people, including four medical staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-odisha-town-a-super-spreader-infects-17-people-through-birthday-and-wedding-anniversary-parties/story-aFZiupWSrMrWQusGH6wWzH.html
22-06-2020||India||57 in state-run women’s rescue home in UP’s Kanpur Covid-19 +ve, 5 of them pregnant||Five girl inmates among the 57 who tested positive for coronavirus in the state-run women’s rescue home were found pregnant, leaving the Kanpur administration on tenterhooks.CPI (M) polit buro member Subhashini Ali met SSP Kanpur Dinesh Kumar P on Sunday and submitted a formal complaint raising questions about the issue. She said pregnancy of girls in the home as well as infection among them needed to be investigated. She said it had emerged that one of the inmates was HIV positive and another had Hepatitis C. Hygiene and sanitisation were major issues in the rescue home, she said.The SSP said he had asked SP Kanpur South Aparna Gupta to look into the complaint.But district probation officer Ajit Kumar who feigned ignorance about the pregnancy of girls till Saturday, said the girls who were pregnant were brought in Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act-related cases.He, however, denied having any knowledge of two of them being HIV and Hepatitis C positive. The DPO is in charge of the women’s rescue home and reports to the district magistrate.Member of state women’s commission Poonam Kapoor dispelled the notion that the girls got pregnant while staying in the home. There were others who were lodged in POCSO cases and were pregnant, she said.Kapoor said it appeared that two girl inmates caught the infection when they were sent to LLR hospital for check-up . Since they all lived together, the infection spread among others.Two days ago, a girl complaining of flu like symptoms and breathing problems tested positive for Covid 19. After that, samples of 33 girls were tested and they were also found positive. Later, 16 and then seven more girls tested positive. Since then, the women’s rescue home in posh Swaroop Nagar has been sanitised and the girls have been quarantined.Late on Sunday night, commissioner, Kanpur division, Sudhir M Bobde and district magistrate Dr Brahmdev Ram Tiwari said there were total seven girls pregnant in the rescue home and five of them were Covid-19 positive. They were pregnant at the time they were brought to the rescue home, they said. Two of pregnant girls have been admitted to LLR hospital and three to Rama Medical College for Covid treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/57-in-state-run-women-s-rescue-home-in-up-s-kanpur-covid-19-positive-5-of-them-pregnant/story-2jX3N8ROjygl8uFiXnri9J.html
22-06-2020||India||100 days of Covid-19: Cooking up a storm in the lockdown||In the early days of the first lockdown, DK Ghosh was a man looking for chicken as if he were an Argonaut in search of the Golden Fleece. Ghosh, a retired professional in Delhi, had been told by his butcher that he could get no meat. So, he walked 3 km towards a cold-meat store he occasionally ordered from but which had stopped home delivery, and returned with a 2kg-bird chopped into curry cuts. On the way back home, he called his friends, and sent them in the same direction. He also stocked up on rice and potatoes, cheese and cream and tinned products for days when his wife would cook fancy; he confirmed at the colony gate that his regular vegetable and fruit vendors would be allowed entry, and then climbed up the stairs to barricade himself. His wife, he found, was re-opening her dormant Instagram handle, with the photo of a sorry looking cauliflower roast. She would get better at it.Roast red pepper hummus streaked with olive oil. Lemon chicken. Chicken with 40 cloves of garlic. Gourd with prawns. Mango flan. Honey-coated ribs. Pulao and paella were uploaded in the days that followed. Her cousins were already on Instagram, and constantly ‘on’.During the lockdown, Instagram became an online derby. Men and women were pickling, plating, baking, flipping, slicing eatables with the same flourish with which, at fairs, farmers present prize animals. Nikita Varma, who runs the popular iamdatingfood Instagram handle and vlogs on YouTube, said, “People are joining Instagram to put up pictures of food in hundreds every hour. I put up a video on making rosogolla but was unsure about the response. Soon enough, I got people posting me back pictures of their versions.” Social media is where people are talking proteins, carbs, community, family, family traditions, all day long.With more than a billion shuttered indoors or separated from their families, social media and family WhatsApp groups were flooded with people learning how to cook, and not just casually. The accidental chef was here to stay. Dr Manish Bansal of Mumbai found his calling in bread, a food item that has been accessible to middle and upper middle-class Indians all through the lockdown in its many varieties. Bread was had at breakfast, lunch or dinner. Getting dry yeast, a key ingredient, was, however, at times, a problem, says another bread enthusiast, Manuja Shroff, an entrepreneur who is a restaurant expert on Tripadvisor. Dr Bansal eats bread, he makes bread. “Baking bread involves organising everything from your ingredients to forward-thinking your way through the stages of the recipe. It also takes patience. You have to wait for the dough to rise,” he said. “This virus is a conspiracy to make men learn to cook. The lockdown has been an awakening of sorts for me.”Rice and grain, however, pushed India’s poor, in the same period, into despair. Rajesh Shah, a vegetable vendor, who services a south Delhi locality, had to buy a 25-kg bag of flour for R1,000 at the Tughlaqabad wholesale market, i.e., R200 more than the pre lockdown price. Seema Devi, who works as a help in four houses in Delhi, almost got on the bus for Patna on being paid token money during the lockdown as she did not have enough to feed her family. During the lockdown, she was not able to afford chicken or fish. So, easy access to, and excess of, protein on one end of the spectrum versus none on the other end, was a snapshot of how India ate over the past three months.A meal-time short-cut was the appearance of one-pot dishes and the imaginative recycling of leftovers as most Indians were working out of home, but also having to do the housework in the absence of domestic help. Sona Mazumdar, chief partnership officer at an entertainment company, said she was “very charged up” for at least the first 60 days. “But when that enthusiasm petered out, I opted for easy fixes like a Chinese chicken gravy made earlier put on top of rice, or pita bread bought from the market which I then stuffed with chickpeas and a grilled beetroot salad.” Shroff said there were days when the market didn’t have what she wanted, or what they have is not of the best quality so she has made do with what is available.“It is OK if I don’t have shaven parmesan on my Ceasar Salad or my pizza doesn’t have basil leaves. The family eats it.”One of the many lockdown habits householders said they picked up was stocking up by default. If they go to the market to buy three things, they now look around and buy three more. “We are eating more than usual, because our daily schedules have gone haywire. Food is a way to keep down anxiety,” says Ravi Kumar, a sociologist in Delhi. The Kumars, a family of four, do a mix of comfort and experimental cooking. This, he says, is ‘crisis food’. The entire production of putting it together is a fragile experiment, a seeking out of the familiar “when life, as you know it, is in crisis or the changes that are happening around you, are either too fast or too slow”.In the first phase of the lockdown, food supply was hit in almost all neigbourhoods. E-commerce did not kick in. “Amazon, Modern Bazaar kept the cart page alive but after one filled the cart and went to the payment page, they said they were unable to deliver. The local grocers functioned best,” said Kumar. Writer Sheeba Aslam Fehmi said, “The delivery boys were apprehensive about catering to Old Delhi areas due to the often false red-flagging by the TV media. We also started to hesitate to order fearing exposure to the virus. Therefore, our order frequency came down quite a bit.”There are mixed reports. Samantha Dutta, head, sales and marketing with a leading frozen food company, relied on Spencer’s online grocery shopping app, Mother Dairy outlets and the roaming vegetable carts. Cultural historian Sohail Hashmi, a resident of Kishengarh village, Delhi, said the lockdown turned many of the unorganised labourers jobless so they turned vegetable vendors. The Result: neighbourhoods such as his, which border tony localities like Vasant Kunj, were never short of supplies. This was unlike the situation faced by his own domestic helps, many of them still without basics such as ration cards.Sona Mazumdar of Gurugram, said the lockdown made her look for multiple options and not stick to the big ecommerce websites and apps. “I started using a new app, Otipy. It delivered fruits and veggies straight from the farms. I used Jalongi for fish. For my groceries and non-veg items, Swiggy was my saviour throughout. In mid-May, Amazon Pantry and Big Basket opened up and I began to order again from them.”Restaurant owners were an endangered species now. Fehmi, who runs Delhi’s Walled City restaurant, was caught unawares when the lockdown started. “We had a full inventory running and we had to shut it down. The dry groceries were given away to the staff and locals.” The restaurant scenario will become less bleak but not “for the next six months at least for the dining-in arrangement,” she said. “We have to ensure the health of our guests, which is not possible till the pandemic is not declared over. As far as the take-away services are concerned, the major clientele was that of students and young mid-segment professionals, who are leaving the metros due to the general closure of institutions and businesses. The staff, too, has left for their home towns”.Sameer Seth, co-owner of Mumbai’s Bombay Canteen, is not ready to give up. If the mountain will not come to Muhammad, then Muhammad must go to the mountain seems to be the policy. “Our restaurants may be closed but our kitchens are open,” he says. The Canteen has branched out into “any time of the day” home-delivery-to-the-doorstep services with half-plate options as well. DIY meals may be the future of the dining industry with restaurants looking for different ways to stay engaged with customers. The Canteen, for example, is getting chefs to hold paid classes via Zoom and sending the ingredients to guests who sign-up; on Instagram they hold ‘knowledge sessions’ that are free. But the situation is still not free of danger. Aekta Kapoor, a magazine editor in Delhi, said from now on, she would “order infrequently and prefer to give businesses to home chefs instead of restaurants. After March 24, June 4 was the only time I ordered in.” Ranjini Chatterjee, a graphic designer who runs a handicrafts business in Kolkata, summed up the collective holding in of breath when anyone, anywhere, orders in these days. “Now if I get a pizza or a burger pang, I sheepishly order and hope for the best.” Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-days-of-covid-19-cooking-up-a-storm-in-the-lockdown/story-Hx1Nh7EV47tQosuoWZWGWP.html
22-06-2020||India||Pollution control boards must intensify actions||State Pollution Control Boards are severely underperforming. The case of the Assam Pollution Control Board’s action in the ongoing Indian Oil fire case, which has devastated the global biodiversity hot spot, Dibru Sikhowa, is a case in point.Why not learn from the Swachh Bharat Sarvekshan (SBS) — a competitive survey and ranking of Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) — to foster institutional action? The SBS relies on the ULBs to fill in the information, and sends out teams for verification. The public is also asked to participate. Of course, this has loopholes, many ULBs claim more than they do, but it forces them to act more swiftly in many areas ranking high on the survey. Given the high toll of pollution, institutional change is urgent.The Pollution Control Boards should be similarly ranked, with modifications. Public participation should be given more weightage. The space given to public opinion will also serve as an incentive for the PCBs to improve public engagement and respond to complaints. Second, pollution control boards are understaffed. It isn’t all lack of funds — it’s just poor management. Scientific posts remain unfilled — recruitment is slow, and technical capacity remains low. Being scored on this could change this. Pollution costs lives and lost lives cost the country. One can offer several remedies, but incentives for institutional strengthening are key. The SBS is an evolving process, yet it is instructive. A Pradooshan Sarvekshan could be the low-cost incentive we need to kick-start pollution abatement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pollution-control-boards-must-intensify-actions/story-D9UnyYQhdfWIOo55fQl3CO.html
22-06-2020||India||India’s infra push behind Chinese aggression||To set the matter straight, the Prime Minister’s Office on Saturday, in a statement, said that the Prime Minister was crystal clear that “India would respond firmly to any attempts to transgress the Line of Actual Control (LAC)”. He specifically emphasised that in contrast to the past neglect of such challenges, Indian forces now decisively counter any violations of LAC, the statement further said. As PM Modi said, because we have better infrastructure in place at LAC, we are to patrol more, and hence we tend to meet more and confront more. To put things in the right perspective, the increased strategic infrastructure has rattled China to no end as the Dragon is facing resounding Indian military might, not the relatively docile India it used to deal with, before 2014.In the last few years, there have been frequent face-offs in certain sensitive areas in Eastern Ladakh. It has been a direct outcome of India’s ability of increased patrolling in the area due to vastly improved infrastructure readiness. In fact, the more frequent face-offs are not necessarily a sign of weakness, or due to deteriorating relations, but indicate greater ability on the part of Indian Army to monitor, detect and respond to Chinese PLA patrolling. As infrastructure keeps improving, these possibilities will only increase.There is a long history of India’s dealings with China, and almost all of the reverses that India has suffered have been during the previous rule, particularly of Congress regimes. It all started with the Tibet’s annexation by China which India accepted quietly in 1959. In 1962, the loss of large chunk of territory, and the then Indian Prime Minister interpreting it by saying that “not a blade of grass grows there”, sums up the attitude towards border issues. During the 1980s and 1990s, when China started taking lead over India economically, militarily, and in infrastructure construction, India was not able to respond and match up in equal measure. In the 1990s, boundary management agreements were signed that further limited India’s manoeuvring ability, particularly the 1993 Accord. The United Progressive Alliance era (2004 to 2014) allowed multiple transgression of Indian land through deceptive salami-slicing methods of the Chinese, and even lost lands in Demjok areas of Ladakh during the period of 2008 to 2012. AK Antony, the then defence minister, conceded in Parliament that we have lost the infrastructure race with China. It was in this era, that the serving army chiefs repeatedly pointed out how our armed forces were facing shortfall of critical ammunition and border infrastructure woes to counter enemies.  The policy paralysis was reversed following the regime change in 2014 and Prime Minister Narendra Modi changed decades of drift in India’s policy towards China by bridging the infrastructure gaps in border areas by constructing roads and bridges with faster pace. It was PM Modi who dared China on several fronts and foiled its bids in Doklam, stopped RCEP, and strongly opposed Chinese dream project OBOR.The genesis of the building up of faster strategic infrastructure can be traced back to 2014, when the Modi government gave it a big push. One of the first decision of the government was to issue a general approval in July 2014 for the creation of road network by Border Roads Organisation (BRO) within 100km of aerial distance from LAC. This general approval ensured that requirement of prior central government and other bureaucratic process were done away with.Subsequently, this exception has been extended to all border security related infrastructure such as border outposts, floodlights, fencing etc, and all projects executed by the Central paramilitary organisations of the ministry of Home Affairs.This was in stark contrast to the approach taken by the UPA government where blocking of such sensitive infrastructure projects under various reasons was the norm. Often the delays were due to flip flops on environmental clearances.Similarly, the Modi government delegated powers to DG, BRO, clearing the way for construction of 66 operationally critical Indo-China borders roads. Earlier, every approval came to the ministry of defence. These powers were subsequently delegated to officers up to chief engineer level in BRO. The government also took crucial steps like the procurement of modern construction on a massive scale during 2017-2020. It also enhanced airlift of construction equipment and material from 2017 onwards, often using Chinhook helicopters.The proactive shift in the policymaking resulted in massive infrastructure creation. According to BRO statistics, between 2008 and 2017, the formation cutting of about 230km of roads were done annually, but this has now been increased to 470km per year between 2017 and 2020 along the India-China border. Similarly, between 2008 and 2017, the speed of surfacing of roads was 170km per year, but it has been increased to 380km per year between 2017 and 2020.Only one tunnel was constructed between 2008 and 2014, while six tunnels have been made during 2014 to 2020. The construction of about 19 tunnels is also under progress.During 2008 to 2014, 7270 metres long bridges were built, while 14,450 metres of bridges were built between 2014 and 2020. In the period between 2008 and 2014, roads of 3,610km were constructed on the border while 4,764kms of roads were built between 2014 and 2020.For about five decades after 1962 war, the construction of these roads which were neglected has now been taken care of and it has been constructed in record period of time along the LAC. Undoubtedly, India’s push to build and upgrade infrastructure along the LAC is behind China’s aggression and recent border skirmishes.(The writer is the former secretary of the Research and Analysis Wing.

22-06-2020||India||Situation along LAC tense with full army deployment||The situation continues to remain tense along the 3,488km-long Line of Actual Control, with both the Indian and Chinese armies fully deployed, air bases activated, and the navy on standby, following the June 15 face-off in the Galwan sector.Though the situation has not escalated since the Galwan incident, the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is continuing troop accretion with support elements on standby, Indian officials familiar with the matter said. The Indian Army positions are also being beefed up in response to the PLA build-up in the Xinjiang and Tibet regions, and the air forces of the two sides are keeping surveillance watch on each other, the officials added.One of them said on condition of anonymity that Indian military commanders have issued instructions to use force if PLA troops cross the Galwan nullah to attack the Indian Patrol Post 14. The PLA has amassed troops across the nullah, and both sides are holding ground, he said.The situation on ground is no different from June 16, with the two armies not thinking in terms of disengagement at the moment along the lines of the June 6 framework laid down in a Lt General-level meeting. Senior Indian military commanders are watching the PLA movement in the Aksai Chin region, while the ministry of external affairs is trying to search for a diplomatic solution. “The situation has cooled to a little extent, but de-escalation appears to be a long haul due to the position China has taken on the Galwan Valley,” said a senior Indian diplomat.Military watchers said they were shocked by the level of aggression on social media -- on both sides of the border -- with several people asking their respective armies for retribution. “All those asking for revenge are war mongers who do not have any idea of destruction a war between two nuclear nations can cause. If the Indian or Chinese soldiers had not obeyed the 1996/2005 military protocol for the LAC on June 15, there would have been carnage leading to a vertical escalation all across the border with immediate violence on nearby patrolling point 15 and 17,” said a former Indian Army chief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/situation-along-lac-tense-with-full-army-deployment/story-RsyciMbh4D7rH5r3iigtyI.html
22-06-2020||India||Will ‘Boycott China’ strategy really help?||Sino-Indian relations will not return to normal for a long time. Diplomatic and military efforts to restore status quo ante at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) will continue. But there is a widespread consensus that Sino-Indian rivalry will ultimately be decided in the realm of economics.China’s economic rise is associated with its export-led growth. This is why every time we have a conflict with China; there are calls for a boycott of Chinese goods. Those championing such ideas believe that our boycott will hurt China economically. Such views are, at best, half-baked. Economic competition between countries, especially ones as big as India and China, is far more nuanced. It requires long-term strategic vision. Foreign trade, at best, can only be one aspect of it. Also, military and diplomatic allies might not be willing to help when it comes to the economy.Any serious discussion on Sino-Indian economic competition requires looking at the US-China gap and China-India gap. The former is what is driving China’s larger ambitions. The latter matters because it tells us about our ability to catch up.China might overtake the US in terms of gross domestic product (GDP), but it will not achieve US living standards. China’s economic growth since the 1980s is unparalleled. Between 1960 and 1980, its share of global GDP increased from 1.1% to 1.2%. By 2018, China’s share of global GDP had increased to 13%. China’s GDP was just 5% of US GDP in 1980. This increased to more than 60% by 2018. India’s gains have been more modest on this front. The growing convergence in Chinese and American GDP has not translated itself proportionately in terms of living standards. Because China’s population is significantly more than that of the US, Chinese per capita incomes are much lower. Even though China is ranked second in terms of size of GDP, it is not even a high-income country today. The World Bank classifies China as an Upper Middle Income country. High Income countries have a Gross National Income (GNI) per capita of $12,376 or more. Upper-Middle Income countries have a GNI per capita between $3,996 and $12,375. India is among Lower Middle Income countries, which have GNI per capita of between $1,026 and $3,995. Of the 218 countries for which this classification is available, 80 are in the High Income Group. (See Chart 1 and 2)Demographic shift will force China to recalibrate its economic strategy. Unlike what is commonly believed in India, high population need not be an unmitigated curse for economic growth. A large population can actually create tail-winds for economic activity. This is because it also brings more working hands. Two factors determine whether this happens or not. One is the age composition of the population. This determines what share of it can actually work. The other is whether or not there are enough resources to work with.China’s high-growth phase coincides with a favourable age composition of its population. World Bank data shows that the share of population aged between 15 and 64 years started rising sharply in China after the 1980s. This ratio was significantly higher than the US or India. It stagnated at very high levels in the last decade and has finally started declining now.This ratio followed similar trajectory for China and India until the 1970s. It was only after China announced the One Child Policy in 1980 that the share of population below 15 years started falling and that of the 15-64 age group started rising. The strategy brought gains to China in the past. It had more workers and fewer dependents in its population. But it will extract a cost now. Thanks to the One Child Policy, the Chinese economy has been adding fewer young workers to its economy. This means that there will be more dependents and fewer workers going forward. Because India did not control its birth rates, it has a larger share of young workers and will continue to see a rise in the share of working population ratio. Developed countries like the US have a stable ratio because they are characterized by low birth and low death rates. (See Chart 3)A falling share of working population means that China will have to keep increasing its value added per worker in order to maintain growth and improve living standards. This will require a move towards more skill-oriented jobs. For example, assembling car parts will entail a lower value added per worker than making a car engine. Where does China stand vis-a-vis the US and India on this count? World Bank gives data on sector-wise value added per worker. Even until 2000, value added per worker in China and India, when compared to the US, was almost similar. China has made rapid advances in manufacturing since then and surged ahead of India. (See Chart 4)The sharp rise in China’s value added per worker in manufacturing is the biggest evidence of its growing technological prowess. Not all of this has come from scrupulous means. Intellectual Property Right and technology theft-related disputes have emerged as one of the biggest sources of conflict between China and the US today. If China manages to catch up with the innovation curve of the US and other high income countries, it can make rapid economic and strategic advances.What explains China’s ability to ambush developed countries such as the US on the technology frontier? It has built a robust research and development ecosystem within its country. This can be seen in the sharp rise of patent applications filed in China, which are not only way more than India, but also the US. As can be seen, India is in no position to influence this competition at the moment. Any significant advance on this count will require a big boost to education spending in India. (See Chart 5)Will ‘Boycott China’ help?Any strategy to even partly severe trade ties with China must carefully evaluate the pros and cons. Such a move will hurt China by taking away a small share of its export earnings. But it will also require finding alternative sources of such imports, either domestically or internationally. An HT analysis by Vineet Sachdev using World Bank data shows that more than 50% of India’s imports from China are either capital or intermediate goods. Consumer goods, which are more likely to bear a Made in China label, have a share of less than 20%. While public opinion might be driven by the idea of boycotting consumer goods, any knee-jerk reaction can end up disrupting capital goods and intermediate goods supplies and therefore domestic value chains. To be sure, this does not mean that India should not strive for reducing its import dependence on China. However, any such policy should work via a simultaneous development of domestic capabilities which can satisfy the import demand. This will require access to funds, technology as well as export markets.Can India hope to get the support of the anti-China bloc in such endeavours? Let us take the example of the US. The Indo-US strategic alliance is stronger than ever today. Concerns about China’s growing power have been an important driver of this alliance. This strategic concurrence, however, has not led to a convergence on economic matters. The biggest proof of this is the continuing impasse over an Indo-US trade agreement.India’s counter-strategising against China will only succeed if we make sure that our bilateral and multilateral reactions to the recent developments maximise our gains while minimising any concessions we make for strategic support. India is a democracy unlike China. Domestic political pressures of achieving quick and radical gains will only complicate the pursuit of this objective||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-boycott-china-strategy-really-help/story-paDe7aiEqGIZUcYkkNsgbM.html

22-06-2020||India||Rajnath Singh meets chiefs, says keep strict vigil along LAC||As tensions simmer along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, where aggressive military posturing by Indian and Chinese forces has garnered global attention, defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday made a detailed assessment of the ground situation at the disputed border, where 20 Indian and scores of Chinese soldiers were killed in a skirmish in Galwan valley, two senior officers familiar with the developments said on Sunday.Singh held an hour-long meeting with chief of defence staff General Bipin Rawat and the three service chiefs at his residence. He was briefed about the preparations of the military and its readiness to respond to any provocative actions by the Chinese forces, one of the officers said on condition of anonymity.The meeting came before Singh heads to Russia to participate in the Victory Day parade in Moscow on June 24. He will meet his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu during the visit (June 21-25), and the spike in border tensions with China is set to figure in the discussions, said the second officer cited above, asking not to be identified.Moscow’s relations with New Delhi and Beijing are currently very good, and Russian diplomats, in recent remarks to the Indian media, have spoken about the need to ease tensions between India and China for regional stability.The minister told the military brass that India will not escalate the border dispute but it will respond to threatening actions with firmness and reiterated that local commanders at the LAC have full authority to do what is necessary to safeguard Indian interests, as outlined by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in an all-party meeting last week, the second officer said.A significant change in the rules of engagement (ROE) by the Indian Army following the June 15 Galwan valley skirmish has given complete freedom of action to commanders deployed along the LAC to handle situations at the tactical level.The commanders will no longer be bound by restrictions on the use of firearms and will have full authority to respond to extraordinary situations using all resources at their disposal, as reported by Hindustan Times on Saturday.The government has given financial powers worth ~500 crore per project to the armed forces to fast-track the purchase of critical weapons and ammunition to deal with any kind of scenario, the second officer said. Similar financial powers for emergency purchases were bestowed on the military after the 2016 Uri terror attack and the 2019 Balakot air strikes.While no violent face-offs have been reported after the deadly Galwan valley clash that has hurt bilateral ties, India and China have significantly beefed up their deployments in the extended region on both sides of the unmarked and volatile border, said the first officer sited above.The two armies have marshalled thousands of soldiers on their respective sides of the LAC and the military buildup consists of fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns and missile systems.The army has strengthened its posture across the length of the LAC – from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh – where reinforcements have been sent and the IAF has also has kept its contingency plans ready to respond to any provocative actions.Apart from Sukhoi-30s and upgraded MiG-29 fighter jets, the IAF is operating Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters – both imported from the United States – in the Ladakh sector that has been the focus of current border tensions.Satellite imagery has revealed a Chinese buildup in the Galwan valley and fresh inputs also suggest heightened Chinese activity in the Finger Area (a cluster of strategic features) near Pangong Tso, where new Chinese positions, bunkers and observation posts have come up between Finger 4 and Finger 8 in the last seven weeks, restricting the scope of Indian patrols to reach areas that New Delhi considers its territory.The Chinese PLA is fully deployed in Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) with air, artillery and missile support, and the PLA Air Force has activated its bases in both Xinjiang and TAR, with fighter aircraft making a show of strength in Aksai Chin area, as reported by Hindustan Times on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajnath-meets-chiefs-says-keep-strict-vigil-along-lac/story-AAFa7TwRDQGdbHqlkUrnIL.html
22-06-2020||India||Chhattisgarh, Centre in tussle over 2013 Maoist ambush probe||The Congress-led Chhattisgarh government is locked in a conflict with the Centre over a fresh case registered by the state police over a 2013 ambush by suspected Maoist rebels in which 27 people, including senior Congress leaders, were killed, people familiar with the matter said requesting anonymity. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) wrote a letter to the Chhattisgarh police last week asking it not to proceed with the investigation in a first information report (FIR) registered by Bastar police on May 26 because the central agency was already investigating it, the people quoted above added. The ministry of home affairs (MHA) too has opined that since both the FIRs (registered on May 25, 2013 and May 26, 2020) relate to the same incident , NIA, which investigates acts of terrorism, has the powers to take over the probe related to the fresh FIR too, the documents, accessed by HT, have revealed.On May 25, 2013, around 150 suspected members of the Communist Party of India (Maoist) attacked a cavalcade of Congress leaders in an ambush at Jheerum Ghati in Chhattisgarh’s Sukhma district, killing 27 people, including senior leaders Nand Kumar Patel, Mahendra Karma, Dinesh Patel and Vidya Charan Shukla. NIA on June 16 approached a special court in Jadgalpur saying that the Chhattisgarh police would be violating the section 6 of the NIA Act, which specifically prohibits the state government from proceeding with any investigation once a case is entrusted to the agency.In a letter to the Bastar superintendent of police on June 10, Amit Singh, NIA’s chief investigating officer of the Jheerum Ghati attack, asked that all May 26, 2020 FIR-related documents be transferred to the agency. He asked the police not to proceed with the investigation as “it may lead to vexatious and avoidable litigation due to conflict of jurisdiction”. HT has reviewed a copy of the letter to the state police.Singh said a charge sheet had already been filed against nine suspects in September 2015 in the case and searches were being carried out for arresting 25 more and the trial too was at an advanced stage. HT has reviewed copies of NIA’s letter to the Bastar SP, its petition in the court and MHA’s opinion.Bastar’s inspector general of police Sundarraj P told HT :“We are taking a legal opinion on NIA’s plea after which a decision will be taken”.NIA informed the special court last week that “the contents of FIR (registered by Bastar police on May 26, 2020) fall in the definition of terrorist act as well as in the ambit of scheduled offence prescribed in the NIA Act, 2008”, while urging the court to give directions to state police not to pursue it. The Chhattisgarh government is in no mood to hand over the probe to the central agency, said the state government officials familiar with the matter. The state government has, over past couple of years, repeatedly questioned NIA’s credibility, saying it didn’t probe a conspiracy angle. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel himself has said on numerous occasions that the Centre is not allowing a thorough probe by the state government by refusing to transfer the NIA case to it.The Chhattisgarh Congress communications department ‘s Shailesh Nitin Trivedi said – “We have been saying from day one that it was a political criminal conspiracy, which NIA has failed to unearth. We will do everything to find out what exactly happened in that in 2013 incident in which our beloved Congress leaders were brutally murdered by Naxals. Why is the Centre not investigating the larger conspiracy angle?”.The Baghel government, in January, moved the Supreme Court challenging the constitutionality of the NIA Act, saying it takes away the powers of states enshrined in the constitution to investigate crimes . The NIA is currently empowered to take over any case in states without their consent. Chhattisgarh is the first state ever to challenge the entire NIA Act.The NIA didn’t respond to phone calls or an SMS query.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chattisgarh-centre-in-tussle-over-2013-maoist-ambush-probe/story-rXnJ1lX8PPhTYj7WQjCI4K.html
22-06-2020||India||Radio channels in Nepal air weather reports on disputed areas: Residents||: Some Nepalese FM radio stations have started broadcasting weather bulletins for Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura, areas close to the border that Nepal claims its own in a move that has irked India, according to residents in the frontier areas in Uttarakhand.These radio programmes could be heard from Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh on the border. The FM stations are located in Darchula, the district in Nepal bordering India.Nepal has issued a new map showing Lipulekh, Kalapani, and Limpiyadhura as part of Nepalese territory, a move that has drawn flak from India.Krishna Garbiyal, a prominent leader of the Rung community in Dharchula town in Pithoragarh, said the Nepalese FM stations have started giving weather reports of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura.Residents in bordering areas, especially in Dharchula, also said the radio channels, in between songs, were airing speeches by Nepali politicians and leaders claiming that the disputed areas belonged to Nepal.“...Nepalese songs are listened to by villagers on both sides of the border, these anti-India speeches, delivered by Nepalese leaders from time to time, affect people living on both sides of the border...,” said Shalu Dayal, a resident of Dantu village of Dharchula.Ashok Nabiyal, a social activist from Dharchula’s Vyans Valley, said Indian intelligence agencies active at Indo-Nepal border need to take cognisance of this “propaganda”. “Nepalese propaganda is clearly aimed at influencing locals on this side of the border and strengthening their claims...,” he said.Districts officials said they were not aware of any propaganda from Nepalese side. “We do not have any such information. Our intelligence units have given us any feedback on this issue,” said Preeti Priya Darshani, superintendent of police (SP) of Pithoragarh.Nrip Singh Napalchyal , former Uttarakhand chief secretary and a resident of Pithoragarh’s Rang community, said that “traditionally and historically” Kalapani had always been venerated as the source of the Kali River.It originates from Kalapani, at an altitude of 3,600 metres, and flows southwards. The area is named after Hindu goddess Kali, whose temple is situated in near the strategically important Lipulekh pass that is on India’s border with China.“Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura are part of the Indian border with China and they have no relation with the Nepal border. Lipulekh pass has served as the entrance of Indian traders and pilgrims going to Kailash Mansarovar, which has never been objected to by any ruler of Nepal till now,” said Napalchyal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/radio-channels-in-nepal-air-weather-reports-on-disputed-areas-residents/story-Y6qF5HNpXwHZ6uo6zR9UBM.html
22-06-2020||India||Assam oil spill: Amid fumes and tremors, 10k people in 12 relief camps wait to go back home||Babul Moran has shifted his “residence” three times in the last 26 days. He was forced to move from his home in Baghjan village of Assam’s Tinsukia district on May 27, the day a natural gas well of Oil India Limited (OIL) located around 700 metres away had a blowout. His family and few dozen others were shifted to a nearby school, turned into a relief camp, 1.5km away from the well. On June 9, the well caught fire, and claimed lives of two firefighters. The fire soon spread to nearby houses, fields and the Maguri Motapung wetland a few hundred metres away.With the threat of it spreading further, the 26-year old and his family, along with others, were shifted to another camp 15km away from the well. Two days later, on June 11, OIL personnel were able to contain the fire. Moran and his family again moved back to the relief camp in the school, where they have been staying since.“We have been provided with adequate facilities at the camp. But the sound from the well, which is like a huge storm, has been continuing since May 27. Since the fire started, we have been experiencing tremors as well and it is very unnerving,” said Moran.Moran’s plight is shared by hundreds of families in Baghjan and nearby villages. According to Assam government, nearly 10,000 people are now based in 12 relief camps, waiting for the blowout to be plugged. Around 15 houses have been gutted by the fire.“Our house was located barely 50 metres away from the well. The fire has destroyed the house, all our belongings, a small tea garden spread over 12 bighas (around 4 acres) and a vegetable garden located 500 metres away,” said Rupam Moran, a Baghjan resident who too has shifted residence thrice. Since May 27, gas and oil condensate released from the blowout has polluted the area. The carcass of a Gangetic dolphin with its skin peeled was found in the Maguri wetland. When the well ignited, it spread to the important bid nesting site, killing fishes, frogs, insects and forcing birds to leave nests with eggs.“When the blow out happened roofs of houses, tress and water bodies in the area got covered with an oil-like layer. When the well caught fire, it affected flora and fauna in Maguri as well,” said Binanda Hatibaruah, a prominent birding tour guide.On June 11, two days after the fire started, several local nature lovers and three experts from the Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS) went nearly 700 metres inside Maguri, and saw the damage to the area first-hand.“Besides the local bird species, Maguri is a nesting site for many migratory birds. This was the breeding season for many birds, because of the oil layer on the wetland and the grassland where the nests are getting burned, they have left. We saw burned insects, dead frogs and abandoned nests,” said Hatibaruah.An environment impact assessment of the area is being done by several agencies on the request of OIL. On Friday, Pollution Control Board Assam (PCBA) sent notice of OIL asking it to close operations at all its 21 gas and oil wells in Baghjan oil field citing violation of norms and threat to humans and environment. OIL is planning to contest the notice in Gauhati High Court.The Baghjan well was producing 100,000 standard cubic metre per day (SCMD) of gas at a depth of 3,870 metres. The blowout happened when workover operations were underway to produce gas from new sand (oil and gas bearing reservoir) at a depth of 3,729 metres.Workover is an intervention in an existing oil or natural gas well that requires invasive techniques like wireline, coil tubing or snubbing.On June 1, OIL issued a show cause notice to the company conducting the workover operations at the well under supervision of OIL when the blowout happened. An inquiry committee had also been set up. On Wednesday, OIL suspended two officials for their role in the blow out.According to a retired OIL official, who did not wish to be identified, the head of the well was being repaired while the workover operation was underway, which is the normal practice. The blowout preventer (BoP) -- a specialised valve or mechanical device used to seal, control and monitor oil and gas wells -- installed in the well was removed when the gas started leaking, resulting in the blowout, according to the retired official.While six foreign experts at the site have expressed confidence about controlling the fire and capping the well safely, the operation requires a large amount of water, installation of high discharge pumps, and removal of debris. All these could take nearly four week, OIL officials said.In September 2005, a similar fire broke out at an abandoned oil well of OIL at Dikom in Dibrugarh district. It needed expertise of foreign specialists and took over a month to bring under control. “There are few methods to control a blow out. First the area near the well is cleared of all debris. One of the oldest techniques is to carry out a blast at the well so that there is lack of oxygen and gas (or oil) in the area and the fire gets doused,” said a retired oil drilling expert who asked not to be named.“Another method is to drill another well or wells near the site and connect them to the blow out well allowing the gas or oil to get diverted. Another option is to put a new blowout preventer,” he added.Protests and blockades by local groups have affected gas and oil production of OIL. Since May 27, when the blow out occurred, the company has suffered cumulative production loss of 8013 MT crude oil and 10.24 MMSCM of natural gas, according to OIL officials. Meanwhile, efforts are underway to control the fire and plug the blowout. Prime Minister Narendra Modi reviewed the situation at Baghjan on June 18 and assured Centre’s full commitment to support and provide relief and rehabilitation to affected families. According to a release by the PM’s office, operations at the well are being executed as per schedule, and the blowout is proposed to be capped by July 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-oil-spill-amid-fumes-and-tremors-10k-people-in-12-relief-camps-wait-to-go-back-home/story-6PAlO0cCMjngcfIP0oFpjO.html
22-06-2020||India||Closure notice to Assam gas field over blowout||The Assam Pollution Control Board issued a closure notice on Friday to the Baghjan oilfield of Oil India Limited (OIL) on the grounds that the company has been operating it without prior permissions, including the key “consent to establish” and “consent to operate” clearances.Any industry likely to discharge effluents or emit pollutants is supposed to get these permissions from the state pollution control boards under the Water (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the Air (Prevention & Control of Pollution) Act, 1981.A blowout that began in the oilfield on May 27 led to the uncontrollable flow of oil from gas well 5 -- causing extensive damage to biodiversity and wildlife the region, according to a preliminary report on the environmental damage caused by the incident. The wildlife in the region includes, among several other species, the endangered hoolock gibbons and the Gangetic dolphins.There are 17 oil wells and five gas wells in the Baghjan oil field, Baghjan oil field generates 1,200 kilolitres of crude oil per day and 1.5 to 2 million metric standard cubic metres per day of gas. OIL supplies crude oil to several refineries including Digboi refineries in Assam, it also supplies gas to various power companies and fertiliser companies and 400+ tea estates according to OIL.The letter issued to OIL — a copy has been reviewed by HT — states that the Baghjan oilfield in Assam’s Tinsukia district is located at a distance of only 500 metres from the Maguri-Motapung wetland, which is a part of the eco-sensitive zone of Dibru Saikhowa National Park, which is “severely affected” by OIL’s “negligence”.According to the letter, OIL was required to take adequate measures to prevent spillage of hazardous waste into water bodies through designated drains and treatment facilities. The environment clearance granted to OIL was also on the condition that the company install a blowout prevention system to avoid accidents during drilling. “But you have failed to do it,” the letter stated.“It is observed that you have been operating your production as well as drilling installations without being equipped with proper safety and precautionary measures for which major accidents are occurred at the drilling sites,” the letter added.The board has sweeping powers over projects in eco-sensitive zones under Section 5 of the Environment Protection Act, 1986.“We have ordered complete closure because of their negligent behaviour,” DN Das, member secretary of the Assam Pollution Control Board, said.An OIL spokesperson said the consent was already sought. “We have applied for consent to operate a number of times, and even deposited fee for it with the pollution control board. The consent has come through for certain installations, rest are pending,” said Tridiv Hazarika.“The PCB had mailed us on June 11 asking us for details of various permissions and data. We had asked for time to reply. It’s a 15-year-old oil field. We managed to send them a response on June 18 but got a closure notice on June 19. It’s not technically possible to close the wells immediately as it will affect reservoirs. Many industries are dependent on OIL for their operations. We are also considering a legal option for a stay on the closure order,” the spokesperson added.Later on Sunday, OIL issued a press release saying it intends to file a writ petition before the Gauhati high court challenging the pollution control board order. It also said that an environment impact assessment study of the blowout and fire was pending.A preliminary report on the damage, by Wildlife Institute of India (WII) found that oil had leaked into the principal stream of Lohit river, polluting the water and the adjoining Maguri-Motapung wetland. “The toxic fumes and oil coating have universally affected flora and fauna. The contaminants and oil are continuing to be released and immediate steps are needed to contain this spill over. The toxins released are known to have long-term persistence in soils and sediments,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/closure-notice-to-assam-gas-field-over-blowout/story-FcRaEKbfyRuq1z1RuIjx1H.html
22-06-2020||India||Hectic backroom parleys on to save Manipur’s BJP-led govt||The Bharatiya Janata Party-led coalition scrambled to save its government in Manipur Sunday with two senior leaders flying into Imphal to talk to rebel legislators whose resignation pushed the alliance to the brink of collapse late last week. Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma and senior Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma arrived in the afternoon on a chartered flight. Sarma played a crucial role in cobbling together the coalition after the 2017 assembly election and is the convenor of the North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA), of which Sangma’s National People’s Party (NPP) is a part. A senior leader said that the two leaders met the rebel NPP leaders to convince them to come back into the BJP fold. Last Wednesday, nine MLAs-- three from BJP, all four from NPP, one from the Trinamool Congress and one independent -- withdrew support to the N Biren Singh government. The BJP lawmakers later joined the Congress but it is not clear whether they will attract proceedings under the anti-defection law.A new coalition led by the Congress, called the Secular Progressive Front, has staked claim to power. “I heard Sangma and Sarma are in Imphal today. Their presence will have no impact even if the CM is replaced. The only solution is Congress-led SPF government,” Manipur Congress spokesperson Ningombam Bupenda Meitei said.In 2017, the Congress won 28 seats and the BJP 21, but the latter quickly cobbled together a coalition and staked claim to power. Later, eight Congress rebels joined the BJP. In the 60-member House, the BJP has 18 members, and the Congress has 20. The BJP currently enjoys the support of four Naga People’s Front legislators and one Lok Janshakti Party member. The fate of seven rebel MLAs who joined BJP from the Congress hangs in the balance after the Manipur high court barred them from the assembly until the speaker took a call on their disqualification. An eighth member resigned after a Supreme Court order. So, effective strength of the House is 52.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hectic-backroom-parleys-on-to-save-manipur-s-bjp-led-govt/story-P1lHmV6c0wJsuZbzF0MXRO.html

We can work with more agility, attention and concentration, being full of positive energy and in good health by practising Yoga. Pls practise yoga every day and be healthy” was the message posted with the photo on Kamal Nath’s twitter handle @OfficeOfKNath.The same photo was posted on International Yoga Day last year when he was the chief minister of Madhya Pradesh.“Did you not practise yoga this year?

22-06-2020||India||Some states plan to cancel contracts with Chinese firms||Some states have started planning to cancel contracts with Chinese companies and instructed personnel to remove China-made apps from mobile phones amid growing clamour to boycott goods produced by the neighbouring country after clashes in Ladakh left 20 soldiers dead. On Saturday, Haryana annulled two tenders for installation of flue gas de-sulphurization (FGD) system at their thermal power plants at Hisar and Yamunanagar. The works under the two tenders carried a financial implication of about Rs 780 crore, Haryana government officials said, adding that more contracts with Chinese firms would be cancelled in the next few days.Uttar Pradesh took a similar tough line. “Uttar Pradesh will not purchase any Chinese stuff for its energy sector,” said state power minister, Shrikant Sharma. “We will see to it that even the vendors do not supply any goods that are made wholly in China or use any part of it made in China,” he said on Friday. His counterpart looking after industrial development in UP, Satish Mahana, however, said on Sunday that ending contracts with Chinese companies can have legal implications. “Such things (cancellation of Chinese contracts) cannot happen overnight as such deals have legal issues,” he said.Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed strong sentiments against the use of Chinese goods but his government has not issued any specific order in this regard. “There is need for reviewing previous trade agreements in a bid to ensure that Chinese products are not used,” Kumar had said at the all-party meeting called by PM Narendra Modi. Bihar industry minister, Shyam Rajak, said there was no role of the state government in banning Chinese products. “Any foreign firms investing in the state has to get clearances from the Centre,” he said.On Sunday, Uttarakhand government instructed officials to find out which Chinese companies have been given government contracts. Madan Kaushik, cabinet minister and spokesperson Uttarakhand government, said he instructed officials to check whether the state government has signed any contracts with Chinese authorities or companies in the past. “After we find whether there are any contracts and if there are, what sort of contracts we have, we will take a decision on whether to cancel them or not,” he said.Maharashtra government officials said the Centre will have to formulate a policy on investment from Chinese companies before states can decide.“As far as foreign direct investment (FDI) is concerned, Chinese investment is allowed in manufacturing, service and real estate sector. If we have to ban them, then the decision has to come from the central government because we need a uniform policy,” said Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary, appointed as state coordination officer to attract investment in the state.Officials in several governments such as West Bengal, Odisha and Rajasthan, said no decision was taken to ban Chinese products. “The decision to ban Chinese companies can only be taken by the Centre. Why doesn’t the BJP government snap all trade relations with China? Moreover, no Chinese company has base in West Bengal,” said Dola Sen, Trinamool Congress Rajya Sabha MP.UP and Madhya Pradesh police have issued orders asking their personnel to remove Chinese apps from their phones.The UP Special Task Force on Friday ordered its staffers to uninstall 52 mobile apps of Chinese origin, pointing that these applications could be used to extract information from their mobile phones and those of their family members. MP police on Friday issued an order instructing all officials to delete 52 Chinese apps from their mobile phones. However, DIG Harinarayanchari Mishra, in another order, on Saturday clarified that deleting the apps was an advisory and not a mandatory requirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/some-states-plan-to-cancel-contracts-with-chinese-firms/story-J6HWe3s0ts1Qv0PHdIodsO.html
22-06-2020||India||DoT to set up committee to review 4G tender specifications||The Department of Telecommunications (DoT) will set up a six-member committee to decide on the tender specifications to upgrade government-owned telecommunications companies BSNL and MTNL’s 4G services, officials familiar with the development said. The move comes shortly after Chinese troops killed 20 Indian soldiers close to the Line of Actual Control, and the central government thereafter instructed BSNL to not use Chinese equipment for the upgrade, which is likely to cost ₹7,000-8,000 crore. The new process will likely disqualify Chinese companies, an official said.The DoT official said the committee will be headed by a senior DoT official and will have a representatives from BSNL and MTNL, two independent experts and another representative from the industry.“The deliberations will start on Monday and new tenders are likely to be issued later next week”, said a DoT official. “Formal orders for cancellation of procurement of equipment from China will also be issued on Monday.” The official said they will encourage procurement of domestic equipment and technology. “The Indian sector will aim to become atmanirbhar,” the official mentioned above said, referring to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s urge to industries to become self-reliant.According to Mahesh Uppal, a consultant on telecom regulation: “India may be the second largest producers of mobile phones, but 75% of the internal components come from China, that will make it difficult to make the sudden switch,” Uppal said. The five key players in the electronics manufacturing, he said, are Ercisson, Nokia, Samsung, Huawei and ZTE, with the last two being Chinese companies. Huawei was also due to participate in the 5G spectrum trials, which are still at the proposal stage, according to DoT officials. The presence of Chinese equipment, said Uppal, is fairly “ubiquitous” in the market. Another DoT official said that the specifications that will be mentioned in the tender process will be “realistic”.“We will bear in mind the capabilities of the service providers in competition. They will also be futuristic, as it will be the entry point into 5G requirements,” the official said.Separately, the DoT is also in consultation with private telecom service providers to encourage the use of equipment manufactured in India. “These consultations will commence in the latter part of the week,” the official said. Former DoT advisor (technology) R K Bhatnagar said that the Indian sector was equipped to handle the challenge. “The Centre for Development of Telematics, the government’s research and development think-tank for telecom, can be the key player on Core Network and their solution will be upgradable to 5G also in coming months. In the last decade they have done technology transfer covering multiple products and that too to multiple private and government (PSU) players.” Bhatnagar added that under the Government funding and Public Procurement (Preference to Make in India) Order of 2017, domestic manufacturers have are given an advantage. “Domestic industries are given preference under the act,” Bhatnagar said. “In case the bids are higher, they are asked to match the lowest bid.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dot-to-set-up-committee-to-review-4g-tender-specifications/story-vzK0j47tzjbfSagcPvrMCM.html
22-06-2020||India||3 staggered clashes took place in Galwan Valley||Details emerging from the debriefing of Indian soldiers involved in the brutal Galwan Valley skirmish shine fresh light on the heroism of outnumbered Indian soldiers who fought off numerically superior rivals, string together the tactics of China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and provide a clearer picture of how the clash unfolded on June 15, people familiar with developments said on Sunday. The seven-hour deadly conflict --- involving three staggered clashes --- along the undefined Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh saw the Indian soldiers put up a fierce fight against Chinese troops who had been pulled out of another sector and freshly deployed on the disputed border to carry out the premeditated attack at a time when a de-escalation plan was being implemented, said one of the persons cited above, asking not to be identified.There was no official word from the army on the new details of the clash.The Galwan Valley skirmish resulted in the deaths of 20 Indian soldiers, including a commanding officer, and the Chinese army possibly suffered more than twice the casualties, as stated by Union minister General VK Singh (retd) in a TV interview on Saturday. It was the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the LAC in 45 years.The first wave of fighting erupted at around 6pm after Colonel B Santosh Babu, the commanding officer of the 16 Bihar, led a squad of around 30 soldiers to a location near Patrol Point 14 (PP14) to verify if the Chinese soldiers had removed some of the installations they had erected in the area, after an understanding was reached at a meeting between senior military commanders on June 6, said the first person cited above.The squad, however, found that the tents and an observation post were still intact and the Chinese soldiers had not retreated. The number of Chinese troops at this location was around 20, including their commanding officer, he said. The Indian squad confronted the Chinese troops but the latter refused to remove their installations and vacate the area, leading to a scuffle in which Colonel Babu was pushed around, the person said. The manhandling of the colonel enraged the Indian troops who thrashed the Chinese soldiers and forced them to retreat towards PP14, a second person said.Babu and his men burnt down the Chinese tents and dismantled the observation post that was within the Indian side of the LAC.“The Indian squad found something was amiss as the Chinese colonel and the troops they had confronted minutes ago were totally unfamiliar. Rival soldiers patrolling the same areas can recognise each other. These were new faces. The Chinese PLA had sent in soldiers from some other area to carry out a pre-planned assault that would soon unfold,” he said. Soldiers familiar with each other are less likely to engage in a brutal conflict like the one that would play out in the dark a couple of hours later, he said. “The wily tactics of the Chinese were at play and Babu sensed it right away,” he added.The Indian squad called in for reinforcements and decided to patrol up to PP14 to check what the Chinese troops were up to and if they had pulled back to their side of the LAC. Now in command of around 80 soldiers, including a few officers, Babu led the squad right up to PP14 where the Chinese soldiers had gathered in large numbers, taken vantage positions and armed themselves with stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs, the first person said.The Indian squad would soon face off with around 250 rival soldiers who were fully prepared for a dirty fight that night.“The second round of fighting began here. Babu and two others were fatally hit by Chinese soldiers and they fell into the river. The Chinese may not have known that they had struck the Indian commanding officer,” he said.However, the moment the Indian soldiers realised that Babu had fallen, they fought against the Chinese soldiers with all their might and killed 16 of them and inflicted life-threatening injuries on scores of others in a fearsome counter attack, the person said. Commanding officers in the army are regarded “father figures” who command immense respect and loyalty. India suffered all of its 20 casualties in the second of fighting.A lull in fighting allowed both sides to call for reinforcements before the soldiers engaged in the final wave of fighting that involved around 600 soldiers on both sides, with the Chinese PLA deploying more than 400 troops in that skirmish, the person said. The bodies of the troops who perished in the skirmish were exchanged the next day. The Indian soldiers were carrying weapons and ammunition but did not open fire as they were following border agreements between the two countries, the government said last week, following a political controversy over whether the Indian soldiers were carrying weapons that could have been used to defend themselves.Apart from 16 Bihar, the Indian soldiers involved in the clash were from 3 Punjab, 3 Medium Regiment and 81 Field Regiment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-staggered-clashes-took-place-in-galwan-valley/story-P1tT2X2fWaJu7smOHXEE0I.html
22-06-2020||India||‘Will pay back, inch by inch’: BJP sets tone for Bengal assembly polls, it’s violent||Marking a radical change in public posture, the Bengal unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has adopted aggression since Friday, with use of words such as revenge and payback causing discomfort for the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC). In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats, marking the party’s highest ever growth in Bengal. Violence has marked all recent elections and the crucial Assembly elections in 2021 are unlikely to be an exception. “If another party worker of ours is touched we will burn down the Danton police station,” BJP state general secretary Sayantan Basu said at a demonstration in West Midnapore district on Saturday, triggering a strong reaction. Basu made the inflammatory remark in the presence of BJP state president Dilip Ghosh. The duo led the agitation to condemn the murder of a local party worker.In what is being seen as a chain reaction, Basu’s convoy was obstructed in Hooghly district by agitating TMC workers on Sunday. “Since the last panchayat polls, 104 BJP workers have been murdered in Bengal. Had I not stopped the angry people in West Midnapore, all policemen present at the spot would have been lynched. Police stations have become TMC offices. We will pay back, inch by inch” said Basu.Significantly, the aggression in BJP’s approach surfaced on Friday when Ghosh tweeted a new slogan: “Badla o hobe, badal o hobe.” (There will be revenge as well as change). The slogan appeared with Ghosh’s photo and a map of West Bengal.With all eyes fixed on the Assembly polls, the new slogan became a direct reply to Banerjee’s slogan before the historic 2011 polls in which she overthrew the 34-year-old Left govt. “Badla noi, badal chai” (We need change, not revenge) Banerjee had said, implying that if TMC came to power it would not seek revenge for the political killings during the Left regime headed by the Communist Party of India (Marxist).Also Watch: Covid & bickering within BJP: Himachal CM Jairam Thakur faces twin battleBy raising a completely different slogan with the same words, Ghosh wants to fan aggression, said political observers. Ghosh, however, stood his ground. “People understand only the language they speak. Cowards talk of forgiveness. Only violence can be the reply to violence,” Ghosh told reporters on Sunday on the sidelines of a World Yoga Day event. Though Ghosh referred to China, his statement was read with a different connotation altogether. “BJP is like the Jaish-e-Mohammed. They are terrorists. People should keep them out. They will destroy Bengal,” quipped the mayor of Kolkata and urban development minister Firhad Hakim.“Ghosh’s new slogan will definitely increase violence. It is time to observe how voters react to it,” said Tapas Roy, minister of state for parliamentary affairs.“These are signs of insanity. Mamata Banerjee came to power saying there would be no badla or revenge but she did just the opposite. The same TMC people who perpetrated violence are now with the BJP,” said Sujan Chakraborty, CPI(M) legislator from Jadavpur and leader of the Left Front in the Assembly.Incidentally, on June 9, Union home minister Amit Shah sharpened his attack on the chief minister, saying that while democracy has strengthened its roots in the entire country West Bengal remains the only state where political violence is propagated. Shah made the remark during his ‘West Bengal Jan Samvad’ virtual rally. Paying homage to party workers who lost their lives since 2014, he said, “I pay my respect to their families as they’ve contributed to the development of Sonar Bangla (golden Bengal).”BJP national secretary Rahul Sinha said, “Banerjee’s slogan ‘Badla noi, badal chai’ gave an assurance of peace to people who were tired of the CPI(M)’s politics of violence. TMC came to power as a savior of the masses but eventually betrayed them. People are tired of this violence. BJP wants to establish peace and development.” “Ghosh’s slogan does not reflect a politically civilised attitude. The common man wants peace above everything else. Voters don’t expect their representatives to propagate violence,” said Udayan Bandopadhyay, a Kolkata-based professor of political science.Before coming to power in 2011, Mamata Banerjee promised to end political violence but killings and turf wars continued.The 2018 panchayat polls saw a spate in violence. While only 10 people died on the day of polling, against an all-time high of 76 in 2003 and 39 in 2013, the elections stood out because of rigging, booth capturing and burning of ballot papers in front of the media and policemen. More people were killed after the elections.TMC, which won 34 % of the panchayat seats uncontested, was blamed for resorting to violence because the state election commission had been asked by the Calcutta high court and the Supreme Court to ensure free and fair elections. The poll results triggered the rise of the BJP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-pay-back-inch-by-inch-bjp-sets-tone-for-bengal-assembly-polls-it-s-violent/story-fT9oS7PqzdOGCI5wKOOP7I.html
