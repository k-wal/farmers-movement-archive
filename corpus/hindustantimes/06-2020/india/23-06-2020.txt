23-06-2020||India||In a setback to RJD, 5 MLCs join JD(U)||PATNA: In a major jolt to Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) ahead of Legislative Council polls in Bihar, five sitting party MLCs joined chief minister Nitish Kumar’s Janata Dal (United) or JD(U) on Tuesday. The assembly polls in the state are also due in October-November.The RJD, which has eight MLCs, is now left with only three MLCs. The MLCs who defected to JD(U) are Radha Charan Shah (2015), Sanjay Prasad (2015), Dilip Rai (2015), Md Kamar Alam (2016) and Ranvijay Kumar Singh (2016).All the MLCs who joined the JD(U) do not face the anti-defection law as they form the two-third of the total number of MLCs of the RJD. A letter about formal joining of the RJD MLCs was forwarded by chief whip of the JD(U) Reena Devi to acting chairman of the legislative council.Tuesday’s development has made the JD(U) with 21 MLCs as the single largest party in the 75-member council, which presently has a strength of 46 as 29 seats are lying vacant. The BJP has 16 MLCs in the council and also has the support of an independent MLC. The polling for nine seats is schedule on July 6.The development also means that former chief minister Rabri Devi would lose the status of leader of opposition in legislative council.RJD state president Jagdanand Singh reacted strongly to the defection and warned JD (U) of a “befitting reply.” “Nitish Kumar has lured legistarors through money. The war has started. He will get a befitting reply,” said Singh.However, RJD’s alliance partner, HAM-S spokesperson Danish Rizwan advised RJD that “instead of giving tickets to capitalists, the party (RJD) should respect its workers.”JD (U) also took a dig at the RJD. “The party hardly respects its workers whereas Nitish Kumar respects all,” said JD (U) Munger MP Rajiv Ranjan Singh alias Lallan Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-setback-to-rjd-5-mlcs-join-jd-u/story-4OOGMM2NhQPUSpOWbTAv1N.html

23-06-2020||India||Call on scrapping board exams likely today: CBSE to SC||New Delhi: Discussions on cancelling remaining Class 10 and 12 board exams are at an advanced stage and a final decision in this regard is likely to be made on Wednesday, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) told the Supreme Court on Tuesday.CBSE on May 18 issued a notification on holding the examinations that were put on hold two months earlier due to the Covid-19 pandemic.A bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari, and Sanjiv Khanna said they will wait for CBSE’s decision and posted the matter for hearing on Thursday. Senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, who appeared for the Indian School Certificate Examination (ICSE), told the court they would like to know what CBSE decides before deciding what to do. The bench told Gupta, “In the interest of the children, if the government takes a decision for CBSE, it should be adopted by you too. You must take this seriously as we are in an unprecedented situation.”The Supreme Court last week asked CBSE, which is scheduled to conduct the exams from July 1 to 15, to consider scrapping the exams. The suggestion came in response to a plea from a group of parents, who have sought the cancellation of the exams citing the Covid-19 pandemic. In their plea, the parents cited the pandemic and said conducting the examinations across over 15,000 centres would unnecessarily expose children to the risk of contracting Covid-19. It asked CBSE to allot marks to students for the remaining papers on the basis of their internal assessment and performance in practicals and examinations they took in March. The petitioners pointed out tat CBSE had cancelled Class 10 and 12 board examinations for students enrolled at 250 odd schools abroad.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for CBSE, said discussions on this are at an advanced stage. “We will apprise the court by Thursday. By tomorrow [Wednesday], it will be finalised.” Advocate Rishi Malhotra, who represented the petitioners, said CBSE should not delay the decision any further as anxiety among students was increasing with every passing day.The bench also asked Mehta to take instructions with regard to another petition seeking the cancellation of ICSE Class 10 and 12 papers exams scheduled from July 2-11. Mehta told the court ICSE is an autonomous board and the Centre cannot take a decision on its behalf. Gupta told the court that ICSE would follow the decision of CBSE. “Let this matter be heard along with CBSE petition on Thursday.” He said a petition in this regard was also pending in the Bombay High Court .The states of Maharashtra, Delhi and Odisha have asked CBSE to scrap the exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/call-on-scrapping-board-exams-likely-today-cbse-to-sc/story-12GO5co9zcDWObND9JOHnO.html

Kochhar hasn’t been named in the fresh case but “unknown” officials of three consortium banks are under the scanner.The agency’s FIR on Tuesday named Venugopal Dhoot, unknown officials of consortium banks led by SBI and other unknown persons under prevention of corruption Act, cheating and criminal conspiracy.The agency had conducted a preliminary enquiry (PE) in the matter first against unknown officials of ministry of petroleum and natural gas, ONGC Videsh, Oil India Limited, Bharat Petro Resources Ltd (a subsidiary of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd) and consortium of banks including SBI, IDBI and ICICI Bank, led by SBI Cap, on suspicion that they colluded with directors of Videocon Mozambique Rovuma 1 Ltd (VMRL), a subsidiary of Videocon Hydrocarbons Holding Ltd (VHHL), a company registered in Cayman Islands, with an intent to cause undue pecuniary gain to Videocon Industries Ltd (VIL).Venugopal Dhoot told HT, “I don’t know about the case.

The first charge on VIL’s oil and gas asset was part of SCB’s security.The VIL in February 2013 informed the consortium of banks that loan of SCB had increased from $400 million to $530 million asking the banks to pay off the loan and take over the charge of oil and gas assets after paying the same.“The SBI led consortium, without any verification/inquiry, approved and paid the loan of $530 million to SCB, London. After paying the outstanding to SCB, the charge on the VIL’s oil and gas assets was required to be taken over by Indian consortium led by SBI. Further, the loan account of SCB was required to be closed by VHHL. However, the SBI consortium in connivance with VIL didn’t create the charge on the oil and gas assets with dishonest intention to facilitate VHHL, which continued to avail the facility from SCB London backed by Mozambique oil and gas asset,” the CBI FIR, reviewed by HT, said.“Videocon didn’t inform about the continued availing of the facility from the SCB to its lenders neither the lenders asked for submitting the closure/No Objection Certificate (NOC) to VIL. The SBI led consortium never took charge of Mozambique asset and the charge of Indonesia and Brazil assets was taken by it in November 2013 from SCB,” the FIR adds.CBI enquiry further revealed that the ONGC Videsh Limited and Oil India Limited, which had acquired the Mozambique asset for $2519 million in January 2014, needed the NOC from consortium banks of VIL before making payments for the asset. The VIL asked the consortium to pay $ 650 million to SCB from sale proceeds but the banks paid $ 705 million and they didn’t even raise objection that outstanding of SCB had already been cleared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-files-new-case-against-videocon-s-venugopal-dhoot-and-unknown-bank-officials/story-avMTD3cBfUcPkuxZ2UM0FO.html
23-06-2020||India||There’s nothing Chinese on your plate||There has been a growing anti-China sentiment among Indians in the past few months. And while that’s justified, it is important to acknowledge that some are just baseless and outright nonsensical – most importantly the call for shutting down Chinese restaurants and banning Chinese food.Before WhatsApp forwards start spreading false claims about Chinese restaurants, Chef Nishant Choubey feels it is important for people to realise that “this cuisine restriction won’t help the cause.” Choubey adds that this will only affect the Indian restaurateur who owns the place. The Chinese food that’s served in numerous restaurants and most importantly at the road-side stalls, have been developed as per Indian taste. “The Chinese food in India is very much inspired and made according to the local taste. In my dishes, I incorporate local spices and is loved by people.”Choubey adds that if there is any way in which the culinary community in India can contribute towards this growing resentment, it is by banning the imports of Chinese spices. This sentiment is reiterated by Chef Harpal Singh Sikka, too. “To me whatever we call Chinese, is an all Indian adaptation suitable to our palate and has nothing to do with China. What we should do is put some embargo on products that are being imported from China, but that is purely the Government’s decision,” says Sikka.Moreover, many youngsters, who’ve made this Indo-Chinese cuisine their staple, understand that the China has nothing to do with what’s on their plate. “I’ve been a frequent costumer to the Chinese restaurant next to my college,” says Jay Shetty, adding, “and while I feel people might start ridiculing Chinese food from now on, I really don’t see the point as the owner is a Maharashtrian and he’s the only one they’re going to hurt, which is quite foolish.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/there-s-nothing-chinese-on-your-plate/story-SryWx2ub0dtDKttXZI7QBK.html
23-06-2020||India||Puri’s Jagannath Rath Yatra goes off smoothly without devotees||For the first time in its history, the famous Rath Yatra of Jagannath temple in Odisha’s Puri saw a large number of priests pulling the three colourful chariots as lakhs of devotees stayed away from the festival following a Supreme Court order.Around noon, about 1,500 priests of the 12th century temple began pulling the three colourfully-decorated wooden chariots towards the Gundicha temple amid beating of cymbals and drums in praise of Lord Jagannath and his siblings- Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra.The three chariots reached the Gundicha temple by 5.30 pm. All the priests who pulled the chariots - Nandighosh, Taladhwaja and Darpadalana – had tested negative for Covid-19 on Monday.Gajapati Dibyasingha Deb, Puri’s titular king, who is also the first servitor of Lord Jagannath, carried out the Chhera Panhara, a ritual sweeping of the chariots before they are pulled. Puri Govardhan Peeth Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati paid obeisance to the trinity atop the chariots along with his disciples.“It’s hard to imagine Rath Yatra without devotees on Badadanda(Grand Road). But Lord Jagannath stepped out of the temple for the whole universe,” said Deb. There is a long-held belief among devotees is that one who pulls the chariot of the Lord gets salvation and is freed from the cycle of births and rebirths.Till Monday afternoon, uncertainty clouded the Rath Yatra before a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court led by chief justice of India SA Bobde modified its order of June 18 staying the festival to allow it to be held with several preconditions.The pre-conditions included the absence of any devotees and pulling of the three chariots by not more than 1,500 priests.After the Rath Yatra ended in the evening, the Shree Jagannath Temple administration said servitors would be rewarded for ensuring its timely completion..In the morning, the district administration had disinfected the 2.5 km long road from the main temple leading to Gundicha temple, where the three deities will stay for the next 9 days.From Monday 9 pm, the police had enforced a curfew around the temple town restricting anyone’s entry or exit for the next 41 hours. Before the break of dawn, there were a flurry of activities in the temple as rituals like Mangal Alati, Tadaplagi, Dwarpala Puja, Besha Sesha, Rath Prathishtha and Mangalarpana started one after another. It was followed by Pahandi rituals of the three deities and Lord Sudarshan where they were carried by the priests from the main temple to the chariots.The devotees, who are an intrinsic part of the festival,had to watch in on television but they were not unhappy at missing the action. It’s all the wish of Lord Jagannath. I am happy with the decision of the Supreme Court. I will see my Lord after the lockdown is over,” said Binapani Mallik, a housewife in Bhubaneswar.Another senior citizen said he was happy to see the Lord come out of the temple. “After the SC order last week, I had given up hope. But I knew that the Lord of Universe would do a miracle to come out on the road and show his face to his millions of devotees,” said Prabodh Mishra, a septuagenarian.On Monday, 1,143 servitors of the temple were tested for Covid-19 of which one tested positive. The servitor who tested positive has been shifted to a Covid hospital before the beginning of the Rath Yatra rituals.After the event, the Puri district administration relaxed curfew in the town.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puri-s-jagannath-rath-yatra-goes-off-smoothly-without-devotees/story-Q2sqyozdsKAXwKJ47h7KHI.html

YSRCP parliamentary party leader V Vijaya Sai Reddy tweeted without naming anybody, saying: “Details of the fourth person who spoke through Facetime? Details soon.”Ambati Rambabu, YSRCP official spokesman and lawmaker, demanded that the government order a detailed inquiry into secret meeting held by Ramesh Kumar with YS Chowdary and Kamineni Srinivas. Rambabu said it reeks of a conspiracy against the Jagan government. He demanded that Ramesh Kumar be arrested immediately.While Ramesh Kumar did not respond to the calls and messages, Chowdary said there was nothing secret about the meeting. He said Kamineni Srinivas and Ramesh Kumar had met him at different hours in the hotel room, from which he had been carrying out official and business activities since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic.“Kamineni had come to my room first and we briefly discussed the BJP activities in the state. After he left the room, Ramesh Kumar had dropped in to meet me and we spent a little time over a cup of coffee. Our conversation had nothing to do with our official or political roles. Our families have known each other for more than one generation,” he said.He condemned the attempts of some vested interests in the media and political circles to show - on the basis of CCTV footage acquired by questionable means - that the three had met.It may be recalled that the Jagan government had removed Ramesh Kumar from the post of SEC on April 10 by promulgating an ordinance to amend AP Panchayat Raj Act, after the latter postponed the local body elections stating Covid-19 as the reason.Subsequently, Ramesh Kumar challenged the ordinance in the high court, which struck it down on May 29. The Jagan government moved the Supreme Court seeking a stay on high court order, but the SC did not grant the same while posting the case to a later date for further hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ex-andhra-top-poll-officer-meets-bjp-leaders-at-hotel-sparks-political-row/story-KioDRNDtztavyAAa3MADRJ.html

While some historians say it was the first uprising against British colonialism in south India, many right wing groups contend that Hindus suffered a lot during the riots that followed the rebellion and eventually paved way for the two-nation theory.Hindu Aikya Vedi leader M V Babu and BJP leader M T Ramesh asked the actor not to associate with the movie titled ‘Vaariyamkunnan’ directed by Aashiq Abu, who directed many hit movies like ‘Virus’, which was based on the state’s fight against nipah virus in 2018.While Aashiq Abu, known for his leftist leanings, announced his movie plan on Monday another film-maker P T Kunju Mohammad, said he will also make a movie on the life of Haji as a 100-year tribute. He said his cast and other details will be announced after Covid restrictions are lifted.While a section of historians and liberals portray Haji, who was captured and executed by British in 1921, as an unsung hero, another section and many parivar outfits say he comdirector brushed aside opposition and said the team will go ahead with their dream project.mitted atrocities against Hindus. “The 1921 riots were an attack against Hindus. Haji is a controversial character like Tipu Sultan of Mysuru. We have requested Prithviraj not to take up this role,” said M V Babu.BJP leader M T Ramesh said it was another attempt to glorify the controversial character. Many right wing activists also took to social media to criticise Prithviraj. But the director brushed aside opposition and said the team will go ahead with its dream project.“He stood up against an empire that ruled a quarter of the world. Etched out his own country with an army that waged a never before war against the British. Though the history was burned and buried, the legend lived on. The legend of a leader, a soldier, a patriot,” tweeted Aashiq Abu while announcing the project. The period cinema is being planned as a centenary tribute in 2021-22.This is not the first time Mappila rebellion is becoming a theme of a movie. In 1988 late director I V Sasi made a film titled ‘1921’ and it was a big hit. But there was no controversy then. The Mappila rebellion which began as part of the 1920 Khilafat Movement, was initially a resistance against British and feudal landlords of Malabar (north Kerala), but degenerated into communal riots.The riot was quelled in 1921 but it led to another tragedy called Wagon Tragedy in which 64 people who were among a wagonload of prisoners being taken to Coimbatore for trial, suffocated to death. In Tirur railway station (Malappuram) there is a memorial for Wagon Tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/movie-on-malabar-rebellion-hero-triggers-right-wing-s-furyin-kerala/story-qzcs7Zn6iC0E9WnNgFibQI.html
23-06-2020||India||Man left 67-page note before killing wife, mother-in-law and shooting self: Cops||The 42-year-old chartered accountant, who shot himself after killing his wife in Bengaluru and mother-in-law in an upscale apartment in Kolkata, has left behind a 67-page suicide note which says he had planned to execute all his in-laws, including his father-in-law and brother-in-law.Sleuths of the Kolkata Police’s detective department are now trying to find out how Amit Agarwal procured a pistol. Agarwal used the pistol to shoot his 65-year-old mother-in-law Lalita Dhandania before committing suicide in his in-laws’ flat on Monday.After killing his wife Shilpi, also a chartered accountant, in her Bengaluru flat, Agarwal took a flight to Kolkata on Monday morning with his ten-year-old son. He told his son that his mother had left for Kolkata and so they have to fly to Kolkata. A divorce suit was going on between the couple for the last two years. On arrival at the Kolkata airport, he handed over his son to a known person and asked him to take his son to his own flat in north Kolkata. He then went straight to his in-laws’.“We are investigating where he got the pistol from, as the cab driver told us that he didn’t stop anywhere enroute,” said a senior official of Kolkata Police, adding that they have got in touch with airport authorities to check CCTV footage.Also Read: Bengal private bus operators demand fare hike due to diesel price hike, Covid restrictionsPolice have recovered at least two pistol magazines from which three bullets were fired. Agarwal, who wanted to kill even his 70-year-old father-in-law Subhash Dhandania, fired at him, but missed. He then shot Lalita while Subhash barged out and lock the flat from outside. Agarwal later shot himself.“From the suicide note, we came to know that he wanted to kill his brother-in-law too, who stays at Gurugram. He had called him to Kolkata but he didn’t come and was therefore saved. In his suicide note, Agarwal had repeatedly accused his wife and in-laws. The entire 67-page note was typed barring one page which was handwritten and might have been added later,” said a police officer.It was from this suicide note that the police first suspected that Agarwal may have killed Shilpi too. They soon called her but her mobile was found to be switched off. Later Bengaluru police were informed and her body was recovered. Police after scanning Amit’s laptop found that he had watched videos to learn how to use a firearm.“From the note, it was clear that he was planning it for a long time. The child is in safe custody now. We have spoken to him once. All the family members are in a state of shock,” said one official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-left-behind-67-page-suicide-note-before-killing-wife-mother-in-law-and-shooting-self/story-MVZTzTZDgRlXQ0tmJjfcDO.html
23-06-2020||India||Assured by Russia of speedy completion of defence contracts, says Rajnath Singh||Defence minister Rajnath Singh said on Tuesday he was assured by the Russian leadership that all ongoing contracts for military supplies will proceed as scheduled and be completed speedily despite the impact of the Covid-19 crisis.Singh’s remarks, made during a media interaction in Moscow, came against the backdrop of reports that India is pushing Russia to speed up the delivery of S-400 missile defence systems following a tense standoff with Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Russia, which accounts for more than 60% of the military hardware used by the Indian armed forces, has called for the easing of tensions between China and India. The tensions spiked after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent face-off at Galwan Valley on June 15.“I have been assured that ongoing contracts will be maintained, and not only will they be maintained, they will be completed quickly and in less time,” Singh said, describing his talks with Russian deputy prime minister Yury Borisov as “very positive and productive”.“All our proposals have received a positive response from the Russian side. I am fully satisfied with my discussions,” he said, without giving details about the proposals.Singh arrived in Russia on Monday – the first trip abroad by an Indian leader since foreign travel was restricted four months ago due to the pandemic – with a high-level delegation to participate in the Victory Day parade on June 24. He is scheduled to hold several meetings with Russian leaders though no talks are planned with his Chinese counterpart Wei Fenghe, who is in Moscow for the parade.India plans to seek the advanced delivery of the S-400 missile defence systems, currently due by mid-2021. India and Russia signed a $5.4-billion deal in 2018 for five systems. New Delhi is also expected to ask Moscow to cut delays in supplying spares for key Russian-origin platforms such as tanks, combat jets and helicopters.New Delhi’s request could potentially place Moscow in a difficult position due to its relations with Beijing. It’s becoming increasingly tricky for Russia to maintain good ties with India and China, Alexander Gabuev, a China expert at the Carnegie Moscow Center, told Bloomberg.“It’s a very important test overall of Russia’s ability to balance its relationships amid growing dependency on China, which is becoming increasingly assertive and pushing its partners to choose sides,” Gabuev said.The sale of the S-400 and more combat jets to India won’t spoil relations with China, said Igor Korotchenko, head of the Centre for Analysis of World Arms Trade. “The Indian arms market is a top priority for us,” he said. “There’s no problem here for our ties with China.”Singh described defence cooperation as one of the important pillars of the India-Russia special and privileged strategic partnership and said he and Borisov had reviewed the defence relationship. The traditional friendship between India and Russia remains strong and the mutual interests of the two sides “are solid”, he added.On Tuesday morning, defence secretary Ajay Kumar also held talks with his Russian counterpart, deputy defence minister Alexander Fomin.Pointing to the 75th anniversary of the Victory Day parade, which marks the end of World War 2, Singh said Indian soldiers too participated in the war effort in the millions and suffered immense causalities. “Many of them were part of the efforts to assist the Soviet Army. Therefore, it is a great honour that an Indian military contingent will be marching in the Red Square tomorrow. This is a sign of the everlasting friendship between the armed forces of our two countries,” he said.Singh also said India is looking forward to a visit by Russian President Vladimir Putin at the invitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this year.On Tuesday, Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov also hosted a virtual trilateral meeting with his Chinese and Indian counterparts, Wang Yi and S Jaishankar. Following the meeting, Lavrov said, “India and China have every means to solve any problems that arise in their relationship…I don’t think India and China need any help.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assured-by-russia-of-speedy-completion-of-defence-contracts-says-rajnath-singh/story-AMnU4SbMLFU3plnVzgJEOJ.html
23-06-2020||India||After abrogation of Art 370, RSS wants probe into SP Mookerjee’s death||More than five decades after its founder Shyama Prasad Mookerjee gave the clarion call for not allowing two Constitutions, two Prime Ministers and two flags in one nation, in reference to Jammu and Kashmir, the Bharatiya Janata Party has ticked that box. There is however, an issue linked to Mookerjee that is still pending, a demand periodically raised by the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the ideological mentor of the BJP to probe his death while he was imprisoned in Jammu and Kashmir.The founder of the Jana Sangh, forerunner of the BJP passed away in a cell in Jammu and Kashmir after he was detained for forcibly entering the state, defying the then law making it mandatory for an Indian to furnish a permit to enter Kashmir.On Mookerjee’s death anniversary on Tuesday, the BJP brass paid tributes to the man who gave the party a task –abrogation of Article 370 that gave the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir its special status.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Union home minister Amit Shah and a host of other senior leaders paid tributes to Mukherjee.Reading down Article 370 that made Article 35A that empowered the state assembly to define “permanent residents” for bestowing special rights and privileges on them infructuous is counted as one of the biggest achievements of the Narendra Modi government.There was however no mention of a probe in the tributes.On his death anniversary last year, leaders underlined how he “sacrificed” his life for the unity of the country.The then newly-appointed working president; JP Nadda also added that while the whole country demanded an inquiry into Mookerjee’s death, former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru “did not order an inquiry.”“History is witness to this. Dr. Mookerjee’s sacrifice will never go in vain, BJP is committed to this cause,” Nadda said.Similar statements were repeated on July 6, Mookerjee’s birth anniversary.A month later on August 5, the House of Elders in Parliament witnessed a historic legislation being passed-- the Re-organisation of Jammu and Kashmir into two union territories and the reading down of the contentious Article 370.More than 10 months after Abrogation of Article 370, the BJP has renamed Chenani-Nashri tunnel, India’s longest tunnel that links Kashmir with Jammu after Mookerjee, but there is no indication that the government will initiate a probe into his death.The RSS that has been steadfastly bringing up the need to investigate Mookerjee’s death is not giving up on this demand.“In 2004, (former PM) Atal Bihar Vajpayee had said there is a conspiracy that needs to be probed. We are hopeful that the government will investigate and put the issue to rest once and for all,” a senior functionary of the RSS said on Tuesday.In 2004, Vajpayee stoked a controversy with his statement that Mookerjee’s death was part of “a conspiracy” between the then Jawaharlal Nehru-led central government and Jammu and Kashmir government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-abrogation-of-art-370-rss-wants-probe-into-s-p-mookerjee-s-death/story-KX0r3HflNIaz4Y4h2gh7II.html
23-06-2020||India||‘Are we waiting to overtake Brazil?’: Kumaraswamy demands 20-day lockdown||Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to impose a further 20-day national lockdown as the current strategy of selective containment has ‘not served the purpose of arresting the pandemic.’In a series of tweets, Kumaraswamy urged the PM not to put the economy ahead of peoples’ safety. Pointing out that India is among the countries with the highest number of Covid-19 cases, he said the problem must be seen in relation with our high density of population compared to other countries.Stating that there has been a rapid increase in coronavirus cases following the lifting of the lockdown, the former CM questioned whether the country would passively wait to overtake Brazil in the number of those infected. Urging the Karnataka CM to immediately announce a 20-day lockdown ‘especially for Bengaluru’, Kumaraswamy urged the government to transfer cash of at least Rs 5,000 to all daily wage workers including cab and auto drivers apart from weavers.Demanding that the government immediately withdraw its move to hold exams for SSLC (10th standard) students which is scheduled from Thursday, Kumaraswamy said that the state government and the education minister would be responsible if something untoward happened to the eight lakh students who are expected to take the exam.“If neighbouring Telangana could promote all its 10th standard students why is Karnataka hesitating. If we are bent on holding the exams let that be conducted in October,” he said in a different tweet.Kumaraswamy’s demand came in the backdrop of the state medical education minister Dr K Sudhakar acknowledging that three members of his family including his father, wife and daughter had tested positive for the virus.Meanwhile, state health and family welfare minister B Sriramulu said that the government would consult with medical doctors and experts to decide on its next course of action.“Yes, the number of cases in Bengaluru has increased. Yesterday the CM had a meeting in which it was decided to seal down four areas in Bengaluru which had seen an increase in cases. If required we will go for lockdown (across the state) again.”On Tuesday, Karnataka registered 322 new Covid-19 cases taking the total to 9721 cases in the state which includes 150 deaths and 6,004 discharges. With 1,035 cases Bengaluru (rural and urban) account for nearly a third of the 3,563 active Covid-19 cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/are-we-waiting-to-overtake-brazil-kumaraswamy-demands-20-day-lockdown/story-I10CATjP6cxvH9K6bOLNyI.html
23-06-2020||India||Arvind Kejriwal writes to Amit Shah on Covid-19. Gets a blunt response on Twitter||Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has written to Home Minister Amit Shah to deploy doctors from the army and central police force ITBP at the 10,000 bed Covid facility being set up at the Radha Soami Satsang campus in south Delhi, according to news agency ANI on Tuesday. But Kejriwal didn’t have to wait for too long to get a response. Amit Shah tweeted a sharp response to Kejriwal within hours, pointing that he had issued instructions for deploying doctors from the ITBP three days back.Also Read: Delhi’s Covid centre, 10 times bigger than China’s largest, to start this week“Dear Kejriwal ji, It has already been decided in our meeting 3 days back and MHA has assigned the work of operating the 10,000 bed COVID Care Centre at Radha Swami Beas in Delhi to ITBP. The work is in full swing and a large part of the facility will be operational by 26th Jun,” Amit Shah said on Twitter, referring to an ANI tweet announcing Kejriwal’s letter. Dear Kejriwal ji, It has already been decided in our meeting 3 days back and MHA has assigned the work of operating the 10,000 bed COVID Care Centre at Radha Swami Beas in Delhi to ITBP. The work is in full swing and a large part of the facility will be operational by 26th Jun. https://t.co/VLMOQdEseYAmit Shah is expected to visit the facility named Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre and Hospital later this week.A central government official said Kejriwal’s letter inviting the home minister was seen as an attempt to appropriate credit for the facility by the Aam Aadmi Party government which, he said, was an initiative driven by the Amit Shah-led home ministry and Lt Governor Anil Baijal.Several other central, state and municipal agencies are collaborating to set up the facility, billed to be 10 times bigger than China’s largest facility at Leishenshan to treat Covid-19 patients.Kejriwal underscored the point in his ‘thank you note’ to Amit Shah. देश की सेना, डाक्टर्ज़, सामाजिक संस्थाएँ, केंद्र सरकार और दिल्ली सरकार - सभी दिल्ली के लिए एकजुट होकर काम कर रहे है। मुझे पूरा यक़ीन है हम सब मिल कर कोरोना को हराएँगे। इन कठिन परिस्थितियों में दिल्ली सरकार और दिल्ली के लोगों की मदद करने के लिए शुक्रिया https://t.co/7jS2zAjgMUOf the 10,200 beds that are being set up at the Radha Soami Satsang Beas campus in Chattarpur, about 1,000 beds would have the oxygen support facility for Covid-19 patients.Amit Shah, who has lately assumed a lead role to prep the national capital for the expected spike in Covid-19 cases over the next one month, also announced that a 1,000 bed hospital with 250 intensive care unit beds was being developed for Covid patients by the Defence Research and Development Organisation and Tata Trust. This facility, to be manned by personnel from the armed forces, will be ready in the next 10 days, Shah said.“Armed Forces personnel have been detailed for providing medical care and attention to Covid patients housed in the Railway coaches in Delhi. 8,000 additional beds have already been placed at Delhi government’s disposal for making Covid care centres, as per requirement,” the home minister tweeted.Shah’s sharp response to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal comes days after the AAP government locked horns with Lt Governor Anil Baijal to block a home ministry-driven move that made it mandatory for every Covid-19 patient to spend five days at a state-run quarantine facility. Lt Governor Baijal eventually rescinded the order, mandating that Covid-19 patients who are not able to stay in isolation due to constraints of space at home should be moved to state-run facilities. Lt Governor Baijal’s new order, however, requires Covid patients to make a mandatory visit to a Covid-19 care facility for one mandatory checkup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-writes-to-amit-shah-on-covid-19-gets-a-response-on-twitter-in-2-hrs/story-IN2BcsLVhHWvHRY4PGGyQP.html
23-06-2020||India||40,300 cyber attacks in the last 4-5 days from China, more coming: Maharashtra cyber department||Maharashtra cyber department on Tuesday issued a warning about Chinese cyber attackers planning a large scale phishing attack and stated that over 40,000 suspected attacks on sites related to information, infrastructure and banking were witnessed in the last 4-5 days. The advisory comes close on the heels of a similar warning issued by India’s official cybersecurity agency in the backdrop of recent India-China border clashes that have led to worsening of relations between the two countries. “In last 4-5 days, resources on cyberspace of India especially related to information, infrastructure & banking have been under attack from China. At least 40,300 such cyber attacks were attempted, most of them can be traced to Chengdu area of China,” Maharashtra Cyber Department Special IG, Y Yadav was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.A report published on June 18 quoting intelligence officials had claimed that China had opened another front against India with sustained DDOS (distributed denial of service) attacks on Indian information websites and the country’s financial payments system.Also Read: China ordered attacks on Indian troops in Galwan ValleyThe attacks attempted to flood a network with artificially created internet traffic and targeted a variety of sites including government websites and the banking system including ATMs.The report claimed most of these attacks were traced back to the central Chinese city of Chengdu—a city known as the hub of hackers and also the headquarters of the Chinese Army’s Unit 61398, which is PLA’s covert cyberwarfare section.These attacks were reported on Tuesday last and continued through Wednesday, however, they were unsuccessful.It is said that several hackers in Chengdu work under the patronage of government agencies to camouflage their operation for official deniability.Indian agencies had warned that Chinese cyber attackers could also carry out a massive phishing attack in the guise of a free Covid-19 test.Australia, too, recently suspected a Chinese hand in a massive cyber attack on several of its strategic sites targeting administration, industries, essential services, critical infrastructure and political organizations among others.Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison had hinted at China’s role by describing the attacks as “malicious and sophisticated” and carried out by “state-based cyber actor”. He further added that “there are not a large number of state-based actors that can engage in this type of activity”.Australian experts explicitly named China for the attacks. Australia has been vociferously supporting the demand for an international investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and has also backed India’s calls for reforms of the World Health Organization in the aftermath of its initial handling of the crisis.China had retaliated with tariffs on Australian exports, including barley and beef.The recent warning is the latest in a series of such alerts issued including the one released last Friday which cited the threat of a cyber attack by North Korea-based cyber criminals.As preventive measures, all the central security forces have been asked to direct their employees against opening or clicking on attachments in unsolicited e-mail, SMS or messages through social media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/40-300-cyber-attacks-in-the-last-4-5-days-from-china-more-coming-maharashtra-cyber-department/story-I1ck3vd94dT9mUv6d7vVCM.html
23-06-2020||India||‘Why is PM backing China’: Rahul Gandhi has one more question over Chinese incursions||Rahul Gandhi continues to lead Congress party’s attacks on Prime Minister Narendra Modi in particular and the NDA government in general over the issue of alleged occupation of Indian territory by the Chinese security forces. In his latest tweet on Tuesday, Rahul claimed China was in possession of Indian land through transgressions of the nearly 3,500km long Line of Actual Control (LAC) running between the two countries in several attempts since May this year and the Indian government was negotiating to get it back while the prime minister had “publicly supported” China’s claim that the land (Galwan Valley) doesn’t belong to India.“China took our land. (Picture of Indian tricolor) is negotiating to get it back. China says it’s not Indian land. The PM has publicly supported China’s claim. Why is the PM backing China and not (Indian tricolour) and our army?,” Rahul tweeted.This was Rahul’s second tweet on the issue on Tuesday despite facing counter attacks from BJP president JP Nadda and senior BJP leader and MP chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan, with the latter accusing him of petty politics over an issue requiring a display of unity from political forces within India.“We are united against the Chinese aggression. Have the Chinese occupied Indian land?,” Rahul’s first tweet had asked.Rahul’s attack is in sync with his party’s strategy to question Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement given during the all party meet called to discuss the incidents of June 15, when 20 Indian soldiers were killed in Galwan Valley along the LAC in eastern Ladakh while resisting Chinese Army’s attempts to erect a structure on the Indian side of the disputed LAC with an aim to change the status quo.The prime minister after having given an account of Indian Army’s increased patrolling in the area and initiatives to thwart Chinese presence in contested areas, told the parties that “no one has entered our territory, no one is at present within our territory and no one has occupied our posts”. Congress has since then suggested that the PM’s statement amounted to a surrender of Indian land to China and it has projected Modi’s statement as a virtual endorsement of the Chinese’ claim on the Galwan Valley.“According to the prime minister, there was no incursion into our territories by the Chinese Army, then why did the external affairs ministry issue a statement in the evening of June 20, 2020 to say that the Chinese army was interrupting Indian patrol since the beginning of May 2020,” a tweet by party’s official handle said while referring to Congress spokesperson Randip Surjewala’s statement.Also Read: Sonia Gandhi hits out at Modi government over border standoff with China, economic crisis, fuel hikeIn another tweet, the party questioned the alleged contradiction in the statements issued by the government and the prime minister. The Congress today also asked the government to disclose the number of Chinese incursions in the Pangong Tso lake area and the Galwan Valley.Yesterday senior Congress leader and former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had indirectly advised Modi against using “disinformation” as a substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership. He had said that the PM should be mindful of the implications of his words on a nation’s strategic interests.After Manmohan’s statement, Rahul had poked the government further and suggested that it followed the former prime minister’s advice in national interest.The BJP had sought to question Manmohan Singh’s locus-standi on the matter by alleging that he had allowed several Chinese incursions during his reign as India’s prime minister. The saffron party also went after Rahul today with party President JP Nadda citing an old understanding between the ruling Chinese Community party and the Indian National Congress.“First, Congress signs MoU with the Chinese Communist Party. Then, Congress surrenders land to China. During the Doklam issue, Rahul Gandhi secretly goes to the Chinese embassy. During crucial situations, Rahul Gandhi tries to divide the nation and demoralise armed forces. Effects of MoU?” Nadda asked in a tweet.Also Read: Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s jab at Rahul Gandhi includes reminder of BJP’s role in opposition Gandhi was also attacked later by Shivraj Singh Chouhan, who accused him of dirty politics. “Rahul Gandhi is demoralising & insulting the army. BJP used to support Congress at difficult times, but they are doing dirty politics now. They should attack China, but they can’t see anyone else other than PM Modi,” Shivraj Singh Chouhan was quoted as saying by ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-is-pm-backing-china-rahul-gandhi-has-one-more-question-over-chinese-incursions/story-qQRC2DFMBqyIQlbPAhZtQI.html
23-06-2020||India||Gehlot pushes for Rahul as Cong chief at CWC meet; party says no discussion||The issue of Rahul Gandhi’s return as the party president echoed in Tuesday’s Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting when Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot said the time has come for him to once again take over the reins of the organisation.A Congress leader familiar with the development said Gehlot’s suggestion was endorsed by former Uttarakhand chief minister Harish Rawat. However, no other CWC member spoke on the matter, he added.Asked about it at a virtual press conference later, Congress’ chief spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala and general secretary in-charge of organisation KC Venugopal said the issue was not discussed at the meeting.“This is the sentiment of every Congress leader and worker. But the issue was not discussed at the meeting today. I am hopeful that Rahul Gandhi and the Congress party will take a call on these sentiments at an appropriate time,” Surjewala said.“I don’t know from where you got this news,” Venugopal said in response to a question.At a news conference last month, Gandhi had indicated that he will not return as the party chief anytime soon amid speculation about his active involvement in organisational matters and series of conversations with global leaders and experts on the Covid-19 crisis.When asked that his active involvement during the lockdown was being perceived as his coming back as the Congress president, Gandhi shot back: “You, please read my letter that I wrote one year ago on that issue.”Gandhi had resigned as the party chief at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) on May 25 last year following the party’s drubbing in the 2019 Lok Sabha elections in which it managed to win just 52 seats in the 543-member House against the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s tally of 303.At the fractious CWC meeting, Gandhi slammed the veterans for “placing the interests” of their sons above the party, and also mentioned that some leaders had even lost the election from their strongholds even as he criticised a section of the so-called GenNext for hankering for posts.He brought finality to his decision to step down as the party president on July 3 when he tweeted a four-page farewell note listing the reasons why he resigned.In the letter, Gandhi took a sharp dig at his party colleagues for the electoral drubbing the Congress received and spoke about the lack of support to him, saying he had stood completely alone in the fight against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).“I personally fought the Prime Minister, the RSS and the institutions they have captured with all my being. I fought because I love India. And I fought to defend the ideals India was built upon. At times, I stood completely alone and am extremely proud of it,” he wrote.Speculation about Gandhi coming back as the Congress president anytime soon intensified after his inclusion in the party’s 11-member consultative committee on the Covid-19 pandemic.Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had named the group, headed by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, on April 18.Another Congress functionary said several party leaders at Tuesday’s CWC meeting raised the issue of lack of support to Gandhi over his consistent attacks on the government on the border standoff with China.“Many leaders felt that it was Rahul Gandhi only who is taking on the government on the China issue and that he is not getting any support from others in the party. It was then decided that the party would henceforth raise the issue in a calibrated manner and forcefully back Rahul Gandhi’s aggression on the matter,” the party functionary said on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-denies-rahul-gandhi-s-return-as-president-taken-up-at-top-body-meet/story-S6wYcLQ46Ib3XxH0PksAbL.html

Earlier on May 4, Justice Colabawalla had observed that as the respondent companies were situated in the United Kingdom (UK) and the United States of America (USA) it would require an extensive hearing to consider whether reliefs could be granted against entities beyond the court’s jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bhansali-productions-moves-hc-to-restrain-eros-international-others-from-exploiting-rights-of-bajirao-mastani/story-AucoLJKF7nfwDElwxiOk5L.html
23-06-2020||India||India considering establishing ‘bilateral bubbles’ with US, UK, France and Germany for air travel||India is considering establishing “individual bilateral bubbles” with the US, the UK, Germany and France allowing airlines of each country in the pact to operate international passenger flights, said the Aviation Ministry on Tuesday. The ministry’s statement has come after the US Department of Transportation announced on Monday that it has barred Air India from operating chartered flights between India and the United States from July 22 without its prior approval, in an apparent retaliation for the Indian government not allowing American carriers to operate between the two countries. The Aviation Ministry said, “As we contemplate further opening up in response to demands, we are looking at the prospect of establishing individual bilateral bubbles, India-US, India-France, India-Germany, India-UK. These are all destinations where demand for travel has not diminished. Final decisions pursuant to negotiations are expected to be taken soon.”  “We have received requests from authorities in several countries including the US, France, Germany among others requesting that their air carriers be allowed to participate in the transportation of passengers along the line being conducted by Air India under Vande Bharat Mission. These requests are being examined,” it added. Scheduled international passenger flights have been suspended in India since March 25 due to the coronavirus pandemic.Air India started international chartered flights under Vande Bharat Mission from May 6 to help people stranded amid the pandemic reach their destinations. The US Department of Transport (DOT) said on Monday it appears that Air India may be using its passenger repatriation charters as a way of circumventing Government of India-imposed prohibition of all scheduled international services.    “We are taking this action (of allowing only those Air India flights from July 22 that have DOT’s approval) because Government of India has impaired the operating rights of US carriers and has engaged in discriminatory and restrictive practices with respect to US carrier services to and from India,” the DOT said. The Aviation Ministry said on Tuesday that it had one round of negotiations with the representatives of the DOT and US Embassy on June 15 about letting American carriers operate flights.  “They were invited to submit precise proposals in this respect.  A communication has now been received on 19 June, 2020 detailing these requests,” the ministry said. Air India has been operating chartered flights on Indo-US routes since May 18 where tickets on both the legs are sold. While tickets on the India-US leg are sold through Air India’s website to the public, the seats on the US-India leg have to be purchased after contacting the Indian Embassy in the US. Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri had said on June 20 that the government will start thinking on resumption scheduled international passenger flights in mid-July, when it expects the domestic air traffic to reach 50-55 per cent of the levels before the coronavirus. After nearly two months of suspension to combat the coronavirus outbreak, the government resumed scheduled domestic passenger flights from May 25 but in a curtailed manner and by placing lower and upper limits on airfares depending upon the flight duration. Moreover, Puri had said on June 20 that during phase 3 and phase 4 of the Vande Bharat mission, private domestic airlines have been approved to operate 750 international flights to repatriate people stranded amid the coronavirus pandemic. Phase 3 of Vande Bharat Mission began on June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-considering-establishing-bilateral-bubbles-with-us-uk-france-and-germany-for-air-travel/story-LlWVNkCUji0EbOWdQstBZI.html
23-06-2020||India||India asks Pakistan to cut strength of high commission by 50%||India on Tuesday asked Pakistan to reduce the strength of its high commission in New Delhi by 50%, saying the actions of Pakistani officials were part of a “larger policy of supporting cross-border violence and terrorism”.Pakistan’s chargé d’affaires Syed Haider Shah was summoned to the external affairs ministry and informed the high commission’s strength should be halved within a week. Shah was told India will reciprocally reduce its diplomatic presence in Islamabad by the same proportion, the ministry said.In Islamabad, Pakistan’s foreign ministry summoned India’s chargé d’affaires and rejected and condemned what it said were the “baseless Indian allegations”. The Indian diplomat was informed of Pakistan’s decision to reduce the Indian mission’s strength by 50% as a reciprocal measure within seven days.India’s move came weeks after two junior officials of the Pakistan high commission were expelled on charges of spying on May 31. In a tit-for-ta action, Pakistani security agencies detained two staff members of the Indian mission in Islamabad last week for allegedly causing a road accident and possessing fake currency.India denied these charges and the two staff members returned via the Wagah land border crossing on Monday. The external affairs ministry has accused Pakistan of detaining them on false charges and torturing them.People familiar with developments said India’s move followed security agencies uncovering several instances of Pakistani officials based in New Delhi being allegedly linked to terror activities.While investigating the case of Jammu and Kashmir Police’s deputy superintendent Davinder Singh, who was caught with two Hizbul Mujahideen commanders on January 10, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) had found that all three were in “constant touch” with an assistant in the Pakistani mission named Shafqat, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.Shafqat, the people said, was allegedly a conduit for hawala transactions and terror financing.In another instance, the NIA had found that Mudassar Iqbal Cheema, posted at the Pakistani mission as first secretary (press) from September 2015 to November 2016, was allegedly involved in providing funds to several Hurriyat leaders through one Zahoor Ahmad Shah Watali. Cheema and five other Pakistani officials in New Delhi were withdrawn by Islamabad on November 2, 2016, the people said.They said Watali was in contact with Inter-Services Intelligence officials, who allegedly provided funding to the Hurriyat leaders. A document found during a search of Watali’s premises by NIA had details of a total of Rs 70 lakh provided on two occasions by the Pakistani officials and payments made to several leaders. This document had mentioned Cheema, the people said.According to a reciprocal arrangement, the current strength of the Indian and Pakistani high commissions is 110. However, both missions are not functioning at full strength and some 40-odd officials will have to be sent back by each side, the people cited above said.Pakistan had unilaterally downgraded diplomatic relations after India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status last August and expelled the Indian high commissioner from Islamabad. It had also decided against sending a new envoy to New Delhi. The post was vacant at the time. The missions in New Delhi and Islamabad have been headed by the deputy high commissioners since then.The last time India had asked Pakistan to make a similar reduction in the strength of its high commission in New Delhi was in December 2001, after the terror attack on Parliament blamed on Pakistan-based terror groups.A statement issued by the external affairs ministry said charge d’affaires Shah was summoned to the ministry and informed that India had repeatedly expressed concern about the activities of officials of his mission.“They have been engaged in acts of espionage and maintained dealings with terrorist organisations. The activities of the two officials caught red-handed and expelled on 31 May 2020 was one example in that regard,” it said.Pakistan has simultaneously “engaged in a sustained campaign to intimidate the officials of the Indian high commission in Islamabad from carrying on their legitimate diplomatic functions. The recent abduction at gunpoint of two Indian officials and their severe ill treatment underlines the extent to which Pakistan has gone in that direction,” the statement said.The two officials, after returning to India on Monday, provided “graphic details of the barbaric treatment” they experienced at the hands of Pakistani security agencies.“The behaviour of Pakistan and its officials is not in conformity with the Vienna Convention and bilateral agreements on the treatment of diplomatic and consular officials. On the contrary, it is an intrinsic element of a larger policy of supporting cross-border violence and terrorism,” the statement said.The treatment of diplomats of the two countries in the national capitals is closely linked to the state of bilateral ties. Indian diplomats are aggressively tailed in Islamabad whenever bilateral ties take a downturn. Indian diplomats have also complained of harassment and of being prevented from discharging their basic duties in recent months.A statement from Pakistan’s Foreign Office rejected and condemned what it said were “baseless allegations” by the Indian side as a “pretext to seek 50% reduction in the staff strength” of the Pakistani mission in New Delhi.Pakistan also dismissed allegations of any violation of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations by Pakistani officials in New Delhi and the “insinuations of intimidation” of Indian officials in Islamabad. The statement said the Indian action was part of “desperate attempts to divert attention” from the situation in Jammu and Kashmir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-asks-pakistan-to-cut-strength-of-high-commission-by-50/story-elc4QnulQf1AczbQa0CQKN.html
23-06-2020||India||Army Chief MM Naravane visits Ladakh; takes stock of ground situation||Army Chief General MM Naravane on Tuesday reviewed India’s military preparedness in eastern Ladakh as he began a two-day visit to the region where a border clash last week left 20 Indian soldiers dead in the midst of a tense standoff with the Chinese People’s Liberation Army. Soon after arriving in Leh, General Naravane visited an Army hospital where 18 soldiers injured in the clash in Galwan Valley on June 15 are undergoing treatment, Army officials said. The Chief of the Army Staff interacted with almost all the injured soldiers and complimented them for their bravery, they added. A surveillance post set up by the Chinese Army on a narrow mountain trail in violation of an agreement was the trigger for the clash in Galwan Valley in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. After visiting the hospital, General Naravane reviewed the overall security situation in the region with the ground commanders, and is learnt to have directed them to keep a high-level of alertness to deal with any Chinese misadventure, people familiar with the issue said. The Chief of the Army Staff is scheduled to visit a number of forward areas during his two-day visit to the region.Last week, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria made a quiet visit to Ladakh and Srinagar air bases to review the Indian Air Force’s preparedness to deal with any eventualities in the region. Before leaving for Leh, General Naravane attended the final session of a two-day conference of top Army commanders. The commanders extensively deliberated on the situation in eastern Ladakh. In Leh, General Naravane was also scheduled to hold an extensive meeting with Lt General Harinder Singh, the commander of the 14 Corps that takes care of the sensitive border with China. On Monday, Lt General Singh held a nearly 11-hour meeting with Commander of the Tibet Military District Maj General Liu Lin. In the meeting, the two sides arrived at a “mutual consensus” to “disengage” from all the friction points in eastern Ladakh. The first round of the Lt General talks were held on June 6 during which both sides finalised an agreement to disengage gradually from all the standoff points beginning with Galwan Valley.However, the situation along the border deteriorated following the Galwan Valley clashes on June 15 as the two sides significantly bolstered their deployments in most areas along the 3,500-km de-facto border. On Sunday, the government gave the armed forces “full freedom” to give a “befitting” response to any Chinese misadventure along the LAC. The Army has already sent thousands of additional troops to forward locations along the border in the last one week. The IAF has also moved a sizeable number of its frontline Sukhoi 30 MKI, Jaguar, Mirage 2000 aircraft and Apache attack helicopters to several key air bases including Leh and Srinagar following the clashes.The situation in eastern Ladakh deteriorated after around 250 Chinese and Indian soldiers were engaged in a violent face-off on May 5 and 6. The incident in Pangong Tso was followed by a similar incident in north Sikkim on May 9. Prior to the clashes, both sides had been asserting that pending the final resolution of the boundary issue, it was necessary to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-mm-naravane-visits-ladakh-takes-stock-of-ground-situation/story-ESFsXXnDCUZe9tgDilL76J.html
23-06-2020||India||Will settle every score with interest, Bengal BJP boss rails against TMC||Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) pugnacious president of the Bengal unit, Dilip Ghosh on Tuesday swore to draw the sword to counter political violence in the poll-bound state as homage to nationalist leader Shyama Prasad Mookerjee, the founder president of the Bharatiya Jan Sangh, forerunner of the BJP.While the BJP observed Mookerjee’s death anniversary as Balidan Diwas (martyr’s day) throughout the country, Ghosh’s inflammatory speech in Bengal added to the volatility in the state’s politics and evoked criticism for being ignorant of Mookerjee’s thoughts.Trinamool Congress (TMC), Congress and Left parties condemned Ghosh who talked of avenging the deaths of 104 party workers allegedly murdered since 2014. “The BJP government has realised Mookerjee’s dreams by scrapping Jammu and Kashmir’s special status under Article 370 and passing the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. We will follow his struggle and sacrifice,” Ghosh said on Tuesday after paying homage to Mookerjee at the Keoratala crematorium in south Kolkata.“If you (TMC) draw the sword, I will draw the sword. If you draw the knife, I will draw the knife too. But if you come with folded hands, I will embrace you. BJP is a strong party now. We can counter the violence. Those who talk of forgiveness are cowards. We will settle every score with interest. I take this oath today in the name of Shyama Prasad Mookerjee,” said Ghosh.“I invite all youths to give one year of their lives to usher in a change. This sacrifice is necessary,” said Ghosh, sending a message for the crucial 2021 polls.Raising a storm on June 19, Ghosh tweeted a new slogan: “Badla o hobe, badal o hobe.” (There will be revenge as well as change). The slogan, which appears with Ghosh’s photo and a map of the state, has gone viral. It is a direct reply to Banerjee’s slogan before the historic 2011 polls in which she overthrew the 34-year-old Left govt. “Badla noi, badal chai” (We need change, not revenge) Banerjee had said.“As industry minister in the Nehru government, a post he gave up in the interest of Bengal, Mookerjee dreamt of seeing an atmanirbhar (self-reliant) Bharat. The Congress, the Marxists and the TMC have turned Bengal into a state of migrant workers over the years. Even Hindi-speaking people who settled down generations ago because there were jobs have to look for work in other states. Infiltrators and Rohingyas are being used as vote banks by the TMC,” said Ghosh.The TMC was quick to counter Ghosh. “Ghosh does not believe in positive politics. On the occasion of Rath Yatra I pray to Lord Jagannath to bless Bengal BJP leaders with wisdom. People of Bengal never accepted violence and this was evident in the 1960s and 70’s,” said Tapas Roy, senior TMC leader and minister of state for parliamentary affairs.The Congress and Left too condemned the propagation of violence.“Ghosh talked of using violence for one year. If violence worked on this soil the 34-year-long Left rule would have continued. People did not use guns and bombs to oust the Marxists. They voted silently,” said Bengal Congress president Somen Mitra.“Inefficient people make a lot of noise. The same violent elements who were seen beside Mamata Banerjee have now joined the BJP. This strategy will not work on people,” said Sujan Chakraborty, CPI(M) legislator and leader of the Left parties in the state Assembly.Noted political analyst Amal Mukhopadhyay, a former principal of Presidency College (now a university), said Ghosh did not follow the facts in history. “I know the life and activities of Mookerjee very closely. I have never seen him speaking of violence or supporting it anywhere, either in his writings or in his lectures. Though Mookerjee was not a Gandhian, he did not believe in applying violence. If someone says that Mookerjee has shown the way to take revenge with arms then I think he is mistaken,” said Mukhopadhyay. In the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 seats, marking the party’s highest ever growth in Bengal. Violence has marked all recent elections and the crucial Assembly elections in 2021 are unlikely to be an exception, political observers say.The BJP has organized a series of virtual rallies to address people in different parts of the state between June 24 and July 2. These will be addressed by Union ministers including Nirmala Sitharaman and Ravi Shankar Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-settle-every-score-with-interest-bengal-bjp-boss-rails-against-tmc/story-oBUTKw1rbNYcxbGqL33qAP.html
23-06-2020||India||Thane civic authority is hiding Covid-19 death figures, BJP leader Kirit Somaiya alleges||Like the Maharashtra state government, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) has also been hiding the actual Covid-19 death toll in the city, BJP leader and former MP Kirit Somaiya alleged on Tuesday. According to Somaiya, the corporation is not revealing at least more than 50 deaths which will come out during the reconciliation of the figures. This figure is not sent to the state government by the corporation, Somaiya alleged.He claimed that the TMC has shown less death figures in Mumbra where the actual death figure is much more. “The politicos in the city are merely portraying a feel-good image of defeating coronavirus in the city,” Somaiya said.He met civic commissioner Vijay Singhal to take stock of the situation in Thane city on Tuesday afternoon.Also read: Delhi’s Covid centre, 10 times bigger than China’s largest, to start this week“I had asked the civic authority to provide me with the latest figure of Covid-19 infections, though I am not satisfied with the figures given by the authority. Thackeray government had hidden 3,000 deaths out of which they agreed that 1,500 were less after reconciliation. Solapur Municipal Corporation also tried to show 40 fewer deaths on Monday, all this will lead to a greater problem in the state in the coming days. Out of the total deaths hidden by the government, 2,000 are from Mumbai and at least 50 are from Thane city,” he said.He added that the death toll in Mumbra is much more than what the corporation showed. “The corporation has merely shown 50% of the actual deaths in Mumbra. We have demanded an inquiry into these discrepancies in data. Moreover, patients are sent to private hospital increasingly instead of the government hospitals in Thane leading to profit for private hospitals. There are also technical issues like lack of oxygen supply or ventilators which the city needs to focus on,” he added.Pravin Darekar, leader of opposition in the Maharashtra Legislative Council also met the municipal commissioner of Kalyan Dombivli Corporation, Vijay Suryavanshi, on Tuesday.“The number of cases within KDMC jurisdiction are increasing as many travel as part of essential services to Mumbai and nearby places. Steps to curb this movement or other provisions need to be made for these people to ensure their families are safe and break the chain of infection,” said Darekar. He also visited Shashtri Nagar Civic Hospital and quarantine facility at Tata Amantra on Tuesday. In a special meeting held at Acharya Atre Auditorium, he discussed the steps taken and measures implemented to curb the pandemic within Kalyana and Dombivli areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thane-civic-authority-is-hiding-covid-19-death-figures-bjp-leader-kirit-somaiya-alleges/story-KzmT0U15aE4dIvuZTBHwfP.html
23-06-2020||India||Social media posts against Jagan Reddy govt gets 2 TDP activists arrested||The Andhra Pradesh police on Tuesday arrested two Telugu Desam Party (TDP) activists for allegedly posting objectionable comments against the ruling YSR Congress Party leaders and the state government led by chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy on social media.In the early hours of this morning, a team from the Crime Investigation Department (CID) came knocking at the residence of Nalanda Kishore, 70, in Visakhapatnam and whisked him away.“He requested the police to allow him to come to the CID office later in the day, as he was not feeling well. But the police did not listen to him and took him to the CID regional office headquarters in the town for interrogation,” one of his family members told the reporters.Kishore, who happens to be a follower of former minister and TDP lawmaker from Viskahapatnam (North) Srinivasa Rao Ganta, was charged for posting some objectionable comments against YSRC parliamentary party leader V Vijay Sai Reddy and state tourism minister Muthamsetty Srinivasa Rao on social media.Getting to know about the arrest, Ganta rushed to the CID office, but he was not allowed to enter the premises.“What major crime has Kishore committed to have been arrested at such odd-hours? Has he resorted to any robbery or leakage of defence secrets or any other anti-national activity? He has just shared a few messages that he had received on social media. This is not good for democracy,” he said.In a similar incident, the CID arrested Chirumamilla Krishna, 35 of Nandigama in Krishna district on the same charges of posting objectionable comments against the Jagan government. Both the accused would be produced in the court in Mangalagiri after questioning.TDP president and former Andhra Pradesh chief minister N Chandrababu Naidu strongly condemned the arrest of the TDP activists for questioning the policies of the Jagan government. He pointed out that the posts made by Kishore and Krishna had no personal attacks against anyone in the government or the ruling party.“In the last few days, the YSRCP leaders have circulated several posts on social media, running down the women leaders of the TDP, including MLA Adireddy Bhavani and spokesperson Panchumarthi Anuradha. Why haven’t the CID taken any action against them?” the TDP chief questioned.Last month, too, the CID arrested P Ranganayaki, a 60-year-old woman, for allegedly posting a comment against the Jagan government in connection with leakage of toxic Styrene gas from the LG Polymers plant at Visakhapatnam. She was released on bail. Similarly, the police served notice on another TDP activist Anusha Undavalli for passing comments of the YSRCP.Last week, the Jagan government served legal notices on Chandrababu Naidu and two Telugu dailies, Eenadu and Andhra Jyothi, for publishing his statements alleging irregularities in restoration of mining leases to Saraswati Power in Dachepalli in Guntur district and in granting contract to a company for production of bags for door-to-door supply of rice to the consumers.The government threatened to launch criminal prosecution against them, if they don’t tender a public apology to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/social-media-posts-against-jagan-reddy-govt-gets-2-tdp-activists-arrested/story-MDamQeTX6AO0KG3EGEBDbM.html
23-06-2020||India||Private hospitals in Rajasthan oppose fixing of Covid-19 treatment costs, govt warns of action||Private sector hospitals in Rajasthan are opposing the fixing of charges by the state government for treatment of Covid-19 patients, calling for a revision of rates even as the health minister on Tuesday warned of action against hospitals that fail to comply.The state government on Saturday fixed the amount chargeable by private labs and hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. Private labs can charge Rs 2,200 per test while private hospital can charge Rs 2,000 per day for a bed while they can charge Rs 4,000 for a ventilator bed in the ICU.State health minister Raghu Sharma said private hospitals cannot be allowed to loot the people. He said the government has appointed a nodal officer who will look into the complaints filed by patients against private hospitals.Also read: Delhi’s Covid centre, 10 times bigger than China’s largest, to start this week“We are not against private hospitals but they should understand their responsibility. They cannot extort money from patients. They will have to provide treatment on the rates fixed by the government or we will be forced to act against them,” said Sharma.He said complaints received on the toll-free number would be investigated by the nodal officer and action will be taken against hospitals. He said the government was willing to talk to the private hospitals and address their concerns.Representatives of private hospitals say they were not consulted before the government fixed the rates.Dr Vijay Kapoor, secretary of the private hospitals and nursing homes society, said the rates fixed by the government are not financially and practically feasible. The society has around 400 private hospitals as members.Dr Kapoor said there is much unrest among the members regarding the charges. “We would urge the government to rethink and revise the rates.”Dr MN Thareja, president of Indian Medical Association, Rajasthan chapter, said private hospitals should be able to meet expenses such as salary and overheads incurred on the treatment of Covid-19 patients.“Private hospitals don’t want to earn from Covid patients. We want to serve patients. But we should also be able to meet our expenses otherwise it is not viable for hospitals,” he said.He said the expenses include salaries for doctors, nursing staff, class 4 employees and sweepers, along with the cost of the PPE kits, cost of food for staff on Covid duty, cost of transportation, cost of accommodation of the staff.“The government provides Rs 2,440 daily to those in quarantine. We will also have to give that to our staff. Hospitals will also have to make separate wards, entrance, lobby, waiting rooms for Covid-19 patients,” said Dr Thareja.He said depending on the city and the category of the hospital, the daily charges incurred would range between Rs 10,000 to Rs 35,000 for a Covid-19 patient.Dr Kapoor added that the private sector hospitals are not being included in decision-making by the state government.“The government is taking so many important decisions regarding Covid-19 but the private hospitals have never been consulted. On what basis have these rates been decided? They should have at least compared the rates in other states which are in the range of Rs 8,000 to Rs 14,000 per bed/per day and then make a decision,” he said.“No representative from our society was invited for discussions even though the private sector provides up to 70 percent of healthcare services in the state,” he said. In Jaipur, the government hospitals have 7,500 beds while private hospitals account for 13,000 beds, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-hospitals-in-rajasthan-oppose-fixing-of-covid-19-treatment-costs-govt-warns-of-action/story-uVSpSm3tUn5N2veuIM944O.html
23-06-2020||India||China ordered attack on Indian troops in Galwan Valley: US intel assessment||A senior Chinese general authorised his forces to attack Indian troops in the Galwan River valley last week, resulting in a brutal skirmish that killed dozens and dramatically escalated tensions between the two Asian powerhouses, according to a U.S. intelligence assessment.Gen. Zhao Zongqi, head of the Western Theater Command and among the few combat veterans still serving in the People’s Liberation Army, approved the operation along the contested border region of northern India and southwestern China, a source familiar with the assessment says on the condition of anonymity.According to U.S. News, Zhao, who has overseen prior standoffs with India, has previously expressed concerns that China must not appear weak to avoid exploitation by the United States and its allies, including in New Delhi, the source says, and saw the faceoff last week as a way to “teach India a lesson.”The assessment contradicts China’s subsequent assertions about what happened on June 15.And it indicates the deadly and contentious incident - in which at least 20 Indian and 35 Chinese troops died, and reportedly a handful on each side were captured and subsequently released - was not the result of a tense circumstance that spiralled out of control, as has happened before, but rather a purposeful decision by Beijing to send a message of strength to India.Yet that plan appears to have backfired, as the incident sparked widespread outrage in India that continues a week later. And Beijing’s attempts to make India more amenable to future negotiations, including about contested territory, instead appear to have pushed the economic giant closer to the U.S.Much is at stake, far beyond territorial control. The U.S. has pressured India for months to back away from employing Chinese tech company Huawei to help build its 5G infrastructure. In the aftermath of June 15 incident Indians were reportedly deleting Chinese social media app TikTok and destroying phones made in China.“It does the very opposite of what China wanted,” the source says, adding that “this is not a victory for China’s military.”It remains unclear the extent to which Chinese President Xi Jinping was involved in the decisions that led to the bloody encounter, though analysts familiar with Chinese military decision making say he would have almost certainly known about the orders.Troops had massed on both sides of the border in recent months in the northern India region of Ladakh and the southwestern Chinese region of Aksai Chin, causing global concerns of a potential escalation between the two.Private geo-intelligence firm Hawkeye 360 recently reported that satellite imagery from late May showed a buildup on the Chinese side of what appeared to be armed personnel carriers and self-propelled artillery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-ordered-attack-on-indian-troops-in-galwan-valley-us-intel-assessment/story-YNC1k3CqzgpayNRwDWxssO.html
23-06-2020||India||Russia backs India for permanent UN Security Council seat during RIC meet||Russia has again endorsed India for a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council and said that the foreign ministers of the RIC grouping comprising Russia, India and China discussed reforms of the United Nations during the trilateral held through video conferencing on Tuesday. India has been pushing for reforms of the United Nations including one of its most powerful bodies- the Security Council—stating that its composition doesn’t reflect the current realities and is not representative enough.“Today we talked of probable reforms of the United Nations and India is a strong nominee to become a permanent member of the UN Security Council & we support India’s candidacy. We believe it can become a full-fledged member of the Security Council,” Sergei Lavrov was quoted as saying by ANI.Also Read: No outside help needed to resolve India-China border dispute: RussiaEarlier today, Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar had presented forceful arguments to back a greater role for India in the decision-making of international organisations such as the United Nations. He pressed on the need for a reformed multilateral world order, which can’t ignore India’s role.“The UN began with 50 members, today it has 193. Surely, its decision-making cannot continue to be in denial of this fact. We, the RIC countries, have been active participants in shaping the global agenda. It is India’s hope that we will also now converge on the value of reformed multilateralism,” Jaishankar said while addressing the RIC summit.The Security Council has 15 members, including five permanent members — the US, the UK, France, Russia and China. China is the only permanent member of the UNSC which is blocking India’s inclusion into the powerful grouping. Half of the 10 non-permanent members are elected every year for a two-year term, starting on January 1.India has been recently elected a non-permanent member for a two-year term starting January 1, 2021, following an overwhelming vote. New Delhi has stated that it will work for enhancing counter-terrorism cooperation as one of its main priorities.Also Read: In a meet with China, Russia, Jaishankar says need to respect ethos of international lawIndia is hoping that its performance at the UNSC in the next two years would reaffirm its credentials to be a permanent member of the council. It is one of the strongest claimants for the seat along with Japan, Germany and Brazil, which together form the G-4—the group that is pressing for reforms in the United Nations terming it outdated and out of sync with the changed global realities.“Our presence on the Security Council and our performance there over the next 2 years will underscore the value that a country like India brings to the table and reaffirm our credentials to be a permanent member of UNSC,” Vikas Swarup, Secretary (West) in the ministry of external affairs had said on June 18.It will be India’s eighth two-year term.Earlier today, Jaishankar recounted India’s contribution to World War-II, which, he said, was not given the due recognition.“This historical injustice has stood uncorrected for the last 75 years, even as the world has changed. Therefore…it is important for the world to realise both the contribution that India made and the need to rectify the past,” Jaishankar said, and added that 2.3 million Indians had fought in the war and another 14 million had participated in the war production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-backs-india-for-permanent-un-security-council-seat-during-ric-meet/story-myzQ36XAHhC6kMdOmMpXOM.html
23-06-2020||India||Reduce mission strength to half in 7 days: India downgrades ties with Pak||India on Tuesday asked Pakistan to reduce its staff strength in the country by half, a decision that comes weeks after the police expelled two staffers at the high commission in Delhi on charges of spying. In the tit-for-tat action that followed, Pakistani security agencies picked two Indian high commission staffers in Islamabad, tortured them and framed them in a false case of a road accident and possession of fake currency.The proposal, as first reported by Hindustan Times, had been moved as soon as horrifying details of the torture of two Indian staffers was conveyed to the external affairs ministry on June 16.Government officials told Hindustan Times that the high commissions in Delhi and Islamabad had an agreed strength of 110 officials. This strength has been halved to 55. Both the countries currently have about 90-plus officials.The external affairs ministry on Tuesday summoned Pakistan’s Charge d’ Affaires Syed Haider Shah and told them about India’s continuing concern about the activities of officials of his mission who have been engaged in acts of espionage and dealing with terrorist organisations.Also Read: Beaten with rods, made to drink filthy water: 2 Indian staffers were tortured in PakBack in Islamabad, Syed Haider Shah was told, Pakistan has engaged in a sustained campaign to intimidate the officials of the Indian High Commission in Islamabad from carrying on their legitimate diplomatic functions.The two officials who had returned on Monday, the external affairs ministry said, had “provided graphic details of the barbaric treatment that they experienced at the hands of Pakistani agencies”.“The behaviour of Pakistan and its officials is not in conformity with the Vienna Convention and bilateral agreements on the treatment of diplomatic and consular officials. On the contrary, it is an intrinsic element of a larger policy of supporting cross-border violence and terrorism,” the external affairs ministry said.“Therefore, the Government of India has taken the decision to reduce the staff strength in the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi by 50%. It would reciprocally reduce its own presence in Islamabad to the same proportion. This decision, which is to be implemented in seven days, was conveyed to the Pakistani Charge d’Affaires,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement.In the discussions on the plan to halve the mission strength, a senior government official said, New Delhi had taken into account how Indian high commission officials in Islamabad were hardly able to move out of the mission due to fear that they could be picked up and framed in fake cases by Pakistan’s Inter Services Intelligence. In contrast, Pakistani officials in Delhi have been going around freely, some of them even tapping people for classified information.Pakistan had last August downgraded diplomatic ties after India scrapped Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and carved out two centrally-administered union territories. The missions of the two countries have since then been headed by a charge d’affaires, not a high commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-downgrades-diplomatic-ties-with-pak-tells-islamabad-to-reduce-staff-by-half/story-wZSDxCD5QYtog2CwqnbO3J.html

A CBI team had already reached Manipur to question Ibobi Singh and government officials.The development comes less than a week after the Congress staked a claim for form a government in Manipur under Ibobi Singh’s leadership after three Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLAs resigned and six others withdrew their support to chief minister Biren Singh-led ruling coalition, reducing the government to a minority..Last week, the Congress submitted an application to Governor Najma Heptullah requesting her to convene a special assembly session for a no-confidence motion against the government.The BJP’s main trouble shooter in the Northeast, Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma who was dispatched on a firefighting mission to Imphal, on Monday ruled out any threat to the Biren Singh-led coalition government in Manipur and said that the political crisis in Manipur would blow over the next two-three days.The BJP’s strength in the 60-member legislative assembly has been reduced to 18 and it has the support of five more lawmakers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-summons-ibobi-singh-in-corruption-case-days-after-his-bid-for-power-in-manipur/story-qMp72UZbBSmkHWm1acLC6O.html
23-06-2020||India||‘Green shoots of economic revival seen across sectors’: Finance ministry||The finance ministry on Tuesday said the agricultural sector would be the foundation of the country’s economic growth and “early green shoots” of economic revival are visible with pickup in agricultural procurement, fertiliser sales, energy consumption, freight movement, digital transactions and forex earnings.“Agricultural sector remains the foundation of the Indian economy and with a forecast of a normal monsoon, it should support the rebooting of the Indian economy,” it said in a statement. Procurement of wheat from farmers by government agencies has been a record 382 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) as on June 16, which surpassed the earlier record of 381.48 LMT in 2012-13.“This has been accomplished during the trying times of Covid-19 pandemic under the social distancing restrictions. Forty two lakh farmers have been benefited and a total amount of Rs 73,500 crore has been paid to them towards minimum support price (MSP) for wheat,” it added.Similarly, procurement of minor forest produces (MFP) in 16 states has hit a record Rs 79.42 crore. Besides, farmers have sown 13.13 million hectares of Kharif crops till June 19, which is 39% higher than the corresponding period last year, with a big jump in area covered under oil seeds, coarse cereals, pulses and cotton, it said.Fertiliser sales, another indicator of farm sector growth, have also surged by almost 98% year-on-year in May 2020 to 40.02 lakh tonnes, reflecting a robust agricultural sector, it said.“Though the GDP [gross domestic product] contribution of the sector may not be very large (compared to industry and services), its growth has a very positive impact on the large population dependent on agriculture,” the finance ministry said.According to the latest official data, India’s GDP grew 4.2% in 2019-20, the slowest in 11 years on the back of falling investment and consumption. In the financial year, agriculture and allied activities recorded a 4.0% growth compared 2.4% in the previous fiscal year. The industrial sector, however, posted a muted growth of 0.9% in FY20 from 4.9% in FY19, and the services sector also slowed to 5.5% in 2019-20 compared to 7.7% in the last financial year.DK Srivastava, chief policy advisor at consultancy firm EY India, said early economic indicators raise possibilities that extremely pessimistic GDP growth forecasts in FY21 for the country “may be belied”.“While growth in manufacturing and services is likely to be negative in 1QFY21, the Indian economy may turn into positive growth territory 2QFY21 onwards. This is reflected by important leading indicators such as electricity and petroleum consumption. These early trends indicate that there is a good chance that the GDP growth may turn out to be positive although at a low level in FY21 if the pick-up is strong particularly in the third and fourth quarters of the fiscal year,” Srivastava added.The economic recovery, he added, would depend on several factors like low interest rate regime, ample liquidity, robust FDI inflows, and continuing low international prices of primary articles particularly crude oil..The finance ministry said while the nationwide lockdown, first imposed on March 25, “gave a respite to ramp up the health and testing infrastructure in the country” it, however, affected the economy adversely. “With a gradual shift in strategy towards saving lives as well as livelihoods - ‘Jaan bhi Jahan bhi’ - India has entered the ‘Unlock India” phase from June 1 with phased resumption of services and businesses,” it said.The government and the Reserve bank of india (RBI) have taken prompt policy measures - both short term and long term - in a calibrated manner to reinvigorate the economy at the earliest with minimal damage, it added.It said that signs of economic recovery are visible as electricity consumption saw lower contraction of 12.5% in June (up to June 21) compared to 15.2% contraction in May and 24% in April. “In June, electricity consumption has continuously improved from (-)19.8 per cent in the first week to (-)11.2 per cent in the second week to (-) 6.2 per cent in the third week of June,” it added.Anupam Manur, assistant professor at Takshashila Institution, said, “Relaxing some of strictest lockdowns restrictions in the world was bound to result in a slight uptick in economic activity. To attribute this increase entirely to government policy measures and interventions is perhaps being lenient with the truth.”While launching the auction of coal mines on June 18, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had said that the Indian economy was recovering fast and cited improvements in toll collection, energy consumption and freight traffic improvements.According to the finance ministry, there is a 130% jump in e-Way bills in May 2020 (Rs 8.98 lakh crore) compared to April 2020 (Rs 3.9 lakh crore) although the number has not reached to the pre-lockdown levels. Value of e-Way bills generated between June 1 and June 19 is Rs. 7.7 lakh crore, it added.Consumption of petroleum products, a major indicator reflecting consumption and manufacturing activity in the country, increased by 47% from 99,37,000 metric tonnes in April to 1,46,46,000 metric tonnes in May, the statement from the ministry added.“In June, growth in consumption of petroleum products is expected to be still higher after one month of Unlock 1.0,” it said.Citing other signs of recovery, the finance ministry said, railway freight traffic saw a 26% improvement in May (8.26 crore tonnes) compared to 6.54 crore tonnes in April. “The improvement is likely to continue in June in sync with growth in movement of goods on National Highways,” said the ministry.“Average daily electronic toll collections increased from Rs. 8.25 crore in April, 2020 to Rs. 36.84 crore in May, rising more than four times. In the first three weeks of June, it has improved further to Rs. 49.8 crore,” it said.The retail financial transactions through digital mode via the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) platforms, the ministry informed, have also increased sharply from Rs 6.71 lakh crore in April to Rs 9.65 lakh crore in May and the trend is expected to continue in June driven by a sustained pick-up in real activity.With the RBI’s efforts towards ensuring adequate liquidity, private placement of corporate bonds have picked up sharply by 94.1% (year-on-year growth) in May at Rs 0.84 lakh crore, compared to a contraction of 22% in April Rs 0.54 lakh crore, it said. “June is likely to see a still larger placement as excess liquidity persists in the system,” it added.Average assets under management (AUM) of mutual funds increased by 3.2% to Rs.24.2 lakh crore in May 2020 from Rs 23.5 lakh crore in April 2020, it said.The finance ministry said the country’s forex reserve was $507.6 billion as on June 12, which would provide a “crucial cushion” to external shocks on the back of higher foreign direct investment (FDI), portfolio flows and low oil prices. “FDI in India recorded an inflow of $73.45 billion in FY 2019-20, an increase of 18.5% over the previous fiscal,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/green-shoots-of-economic-revival-seen-across-sectors-finance-ministry/story-wB02jcVUZkEPeNyvj8OZ5I.html
23-06-2020||India||No outside help needed to resolve India-China border dispute: Russia||Russia has said that it doesn’t believe that India and China need ‘help from outside’--a reference to third party involvement—to resolve bilateral issues and added that both the countries have showed their commitment to “peaceful resolution” of the recent incidents of boundary dispute that has led to violent clashes between the armies of the two neighbours. The statement comes on a day when India-Russia and China were engaged in a RIC trilateral to discuss several issues including cooperation to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said that Russia hoped that the (border) situation between India and China will “continue to be peaceful” as “neither side” had given statements to indicate that any of them would pursue “non-diplomatic” solutions.Earlier today, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, who is representing India in the summit, had said that the world’s “leading voices” should act in an exemplary manner by respecting international law and recognising the interests of partners. This was seen as an indirect reference to China’s “unilateral” actions at the LAC which led to violent clashes between the two sides on June 15, resulting in deaths of 20 Indian soldiers and an undeclared number of Chinese casualties.“I don’t think that India & China need any help from the outside. I don’t think they need to be helped, especially when it comes to country issues. They can solve them on their own, it means the recent events,” Lavrov was quoted as saying at the RIC foreign ministers’ meeting.The RIC meeting is being held through video conference and it was expected that it won’t delve on the issue of Indo-China border stand-off. Lavrov suggested that Russia recognised efforts from both sides to defuse the tensions through diplomatic options.“New Delhi-Beijing showed their commitment to peaceful resolution. They started meetings at the level of defence officers, foreign ministers and neither of the two sides made any statements which would indicate that any of them would pursue non-diplomatic solutions,” ANI quoted him as saying.He added that Russia hopes for a peaceful solution of disputes between the two countries.“We hope that the situation will continue to be peaceful and they will continue to be committed to peaceful resolution of disputes,” ANI quoted Lavrov.Russia is considered to have good relations with both Beijing and New Delhi. Indian defence minister Rajnath Singh is on a three day trip to Moscow to attend a grand military parade to mark the 75th anniversary of the soviet victory over Germany in the second World War. He is expected to hold talks with Russia’s top military leadership.Also Watch: Need to respect international law..’: Jaishankar in a meet with China, RussiaEarlier today, external affairs minister S Jaishankar took a dig at China without naming the country and said that India believed in “time-tested principles of international relations” while advocating practice of “multilateralism” and “common good” as the only way of building a “durable” world order.Russian foreign minister Lavrov’s comments also come in the backdrop of a meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC, where a “mutual consensus to disengage” from “all friction areas” was said to a have been reached, according to officials privy to the details.Also Read: India takes another step to block China products with new rulesThe delegations were led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region.The Indian side was demanding the pullback of Chinese troops from the Finger Area, where the PLA has set up bunkers, pillboxes and observation posts, withdrawal of the PLA troops from Galwan Valley and the restoration of status quo ante in key strategic areas, according to the two officials aware of the developments. India was also seeking an assurance that the Chinese side will end aggression along the LAC and reduction of Chinese deployments in “depth areas” on their side of the disputed border, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-outside-help-needed-to-resolve-india-china-border-dispute-russia/story-sFrwZfDDMZw1pkxKTfnpEK.html
23-06-2020||India||‘We’ve bridged the gap of 6 decades in 6 years under PM Modi’s leadership’: Nadda||Under Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s leadership, the nation has bridged the gap of 6 decades in just 6 years, Bharatiya Janata Party national president Jagat Prakash Nadda said while addressing the Assam Jan Samvad virtual rally on Tuesday.Nadda said that this year is a marked by great achievements and has also exhibited how the country could fight the Covid-19 battle in the “best possible manner”. “At the beginning of the crisis, we were not producing PPE kits but now over 4 lakh PPE kits are being produced daily. Covid-19 cases were doubling in three days earlier, now the doubling rate is around 17 days. Previously, we could test only 1,500 samples in a day which has gone up to 1.5 lakh daily,” the BJP president said. Nadda opened his address by remembering and paying homage to 20 Indian Army bravehearts who lost their lives in the violent clash with the Chinese military during last week’s face-off in Ladakh. Also read: BJP’s JP Nadda takes on Rahul Gandhi’s jibes over India-China stand-offHe also lauded the undying spirit of the nation’s ‘corona warriors’ in their selfless fight against the contagion. Nadda had previously addressed similar virtual rallies dedicated to Kerala, Uttar Pradesh and Telangana. On Sunday, while addressing the UP Jan Samvad Rally, Nadda had said that PM Modi is not only the leader of humans but also of Gods. Nadda was reacting to former Congress chief to Rahul Gandhi’s ‘Surender Modi’ comment.“Even God is not with you (Congress) now. You say - ‘Narendra Modi is Surender Modi’ that means you are saying that Modi ji is not only the leader of humans but also of Gods. You should understand the language of God,” Nadda had said.Gandhi had shared an international daily’s article titled ‘India’s appeasement policy toward China unravels’ on Twitter, and wrote: “Narendra Modi Is actually Surender Modi”.Nadda assured the people of the nation “that every inch of our country’s land is secure under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Congress party is demoralizing the security forces,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/necessity-is-the-mother-of-invention-nadda-underscores-significance-of-turning-covid-19-crisis-into-opportunity/story-mlm2kz8gWxpPhMsU9QHSaO.html

23-06-2020||India||Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s jab at Rahul Gandhi includes reminder of BJP’s role in opposition||Madhya Pradesh chief minister and senior BJP leader Shivraj Singh Chouhan has accused Congress leader Rahul Gandhi of “demoralizing” and “insulting” Indian army and said that unlike the BJP, the Congress, as the main opposition party, is not supporting the government during difficult times. Chouhan’s attack on Rahul Gandhi comes close on heels of BJP President JP Nadda accusing the former Congress president of trying to “divide the nation” by questioning the government’s handling of the recent face-off with China at the line of actual control.“Rahul Gandhi is demoralising & insulting the army. BJP used to support Congress at difficult times, but they are doing dirty politics now. They should attack China, but they can’t see anyone else other than PM Modi,” Shivraj Singh Chouhan was quoted as saying by ANI.The political war over the issue of Chinese act of aggression leading to deaths of 20 Indian soldiers including a colonel rank officer on the night of June 15 has intensified in the past few days after Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed an all party meeting on the issue, where he told the gathering that “no one has entered our territory, no one is at present within our territory and no one has occupied our posts”.His statement led to political opponents and some experts allege that India had surrendered land to the Chinese and PM Modi could be attempting to appease the Chinese leadership despite the latter being in control of our territories through acts of encroachment in the last 2 months or so.Also Read: BJP’s JP Nadda takes on Rahul Gandhi’s jibes over India-China stand-off, cites MoUsOn Monday, former prime minister and senior Congress leader Manmohan Singh also built on the same theme alleging that “disinformation” was no substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership and advised PM Modi to be mindful of the implications of his words on a nation’s strategic interests.Soon after Rahul Gandhi tweeted Manmohan Singh’s statement and said he hoped that PM Modi will humbly follow the advice given by Singh for India’s benefit. He continued his tirade against the government by suggesting that PM’s statement given at the all party meeting was being lauded by Chinese publications. On Tuesday, he went ahead to ask if China had occupied Indian land.“We stand united against Chinese attack. Has China occupied Indian land,” Gandhi tweeted on Tuesday.The Congress party, too, has been attacking the government in tandem. The party’s top decision making body, the Congress Working Committee (CWC) blamed the government’s policies for alleged setbacks on multiple fronts. A tweet from the party’s official account repeated the point.Sonia Gandhi hits out at Modi government over border standoff with China, economic crisis, fuel hike“BJP’s misplaced trust in China & PM Modi’s policy of appeasement has led us to where we are today. Denial of the obvious is only furthering China’s agenda, but is that what the BJP wanted all along?,” said the tweet.The party accused the ruling party of not being able to “walk its own talk” and alleged that due to its “weak foreign policy” the borders were experiencing tension.“During BJP’s rule, 20 of our soldiers get martyred; and the BJP led government has not been able to take any strong decision against China due to lack of decisiveness,” another tweet posted on Congress party’s official handle alleged.The Congress’ criticism has continued despite a clarification by the government that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement referred to the situation after Indian Army’s brave action to thwart Chinese attempts to erect a structure on the Indian side of the LAC on June 15. It further cited statements by the external affairs ministry to bring home the point that Indian government has categorically objected to attempts by the Chinese military to alter the status quo at the LAC in violation of understanding between the two countries. It also referred to the unequivocal statement that the Chinese side was responsible for the deadly violence by erecting a structure on the Indian side of the LAC.Nadda was the first to attack Rahul Gandhi and the Congress on Tuesday. He referred to an understanding between Congress and the Communist Party of China and asked if that was guiding Congress leader’s statements against the government.“First, Congress signs MoU with the Chinese Communist Party. Then, Congress surrenders land to China. During the Doklam issue, Rahul Gandhi secretly goes to the Chinese embassy. During crucial situations, Rahul Gandhi tries to divide the nation and demoralise armed forces. Effects of MoU?” Nadda asked in a tweet.The two parties had signed an agreement in 2008 to facilitate high-level exchange between their leaders and to consult each other over important regional and international issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-s-jab-at-rahul-gandhi-includes-reminder-of-bjp-s-role-in-opposition/story-SNpJvZkBjtQZv5Ho7EPdhL.html
23-06-2020||India||Fresh locust swarms threaten with monsoon onset in Rajasthan||Fresh swarms of locust are likely to invade India from the Horn of Africa in either end-June or early-July depending on the strength of the south-westerly monsoon winds.The Jodhpur-based Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) authorities are preparing to control the swarms that are likely to move across the Indian Ocean with winds because of the aerial spraying of pesticides.The onset of monsoon in Rajasthan is likely to occur on June 24 or 25 and the LWO authorities are preparing to control the population of locusts that are hovering in the desert areas between India and neighbouring Pakistan and also possible local breeding of these insects.“We are expecting swarms from other parts of Rajasthan and MP to return to the desert areas as soon as it starts raining. Once locusts lay eggs, they immediately start hatching them and that can be controlled by spraying of insecticides. So far, some breeding has occurred in Bikaner,” said KL Gurjar, deputy director, LWO.Last week, the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) had warned that Sudan, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Pakistan, and India should remain on high alert for the next four weeks for fresh locust invasions.Any swarms in northern Somalia in the Horn of Africa can migrate across the Indian Ocean to the summer breeding areas along both sides of the Indo-Pakistan border.“There are successive breeding cycles in the Horn of Africa. Some swarms from there are moving towards western Africa, while some are moving towards Saudi Arabia, Oman and Yemen in the Persian Gulf. These can also come to India in July. Some are expected to directly move to India from the Horn of Africa with the monsoon winds,” Gurjar said.“The winds are moving from the direction of the Horn of Africa towards India. The wind direction is south-westerly during monsoon,” said Dr. Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, India Meteorological Department (IMD).So far, the impact on food security due to locust invasions has not been much.However, LWO authorities said the Kharif crop, especially maize and cotton, is likely to be impacted if the two locust threats—from the Indian Ocean and from the breeding sites in India aren’t controlled.“Only green cover has been impacted because there was no standing crop. We are well prepared. Helicopters and drones are being used for aerial spraying. The number of vehicles deployed has also increased,” said Gurjar.The LWO authorities and state governments have controlled locust attack over two lakh hectares by the spraying of toxic pesticides such as Lambda Cyhalothrin, Malathion 96 and Chlorpyrifos.IMD authorities on Tuesday said that the conditions are becoming favourable for the advancement of south-western monsoon into remaining parts of Gujarat, MP, Uttar Pradesh, the entire western Himalayan region, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, most parts of Punjab and some parts of Rajasthan during the next 48 hours.A trough of low pressure at mean sea level is running from north-western Rajasthan to the northwestern Bay of Bengal across northeastern Rajasthan, northern MP, northern parts of Chhattisgarh, southern parts of Jharkhand and northern parts of Odisha at lower tropospheric levels.Widespread and heavy rains are likely to continue over the north-east and adjoining eastern India during the next five days, IMD’s Tuesday bulletin said.Heavy to very heavy rainfall is also likely to occur over parts of western Himalayas and northern plains from June 24 to 25.The country has received 25% excess rains till Tuesday, including central India (99.6%); peninsular India (8%); north-western India (8%); and eastern and north-eastern India (3%).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fresh-locust-swarms-threaten-with-monsoon-onset-in-rajasthan/story-UI4oEu5JNoY6AVhvAG5OYN.html
23-06-2020||India||Truck driver booked after bridge collapse near Indo-China border in Uttarakhand||A day after a Bailey bridge near the Indo-China border in Munsiyari area in Uttarakhand’s Pithoragarh district collapsed when a flatbed truck with an excavator on it was trying to cross despite warnings not to do so, police on Tuesday booked the driver for negligence and damaging the bridge.On Monday, the bridge collapsed into a rivulet when the truck tried to cross it despite several warnings. The collapse of the bridge which was also used by the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) and army personnel to reach their posts near Chinese border has cut off a population of about 7,000 people living in villages across it. Mohammed Asif Khan, station house officer, Munsiyari police station said, “We have booked the driver of the trailer truck identified as one Godhan, a resident of Almora for negligent driving and causing damage to public property under relevant sections of the IPC on Tuesday.”“We took the action after receiving a complaint from assistant engineer Jaiveer Singh of the department concerned in which he accused him of crossing the bridge despite several warnings by construction workers there,” said Khan. The police officer said that the accused has not been arrested yet as he is still undergoing treatment in the hospital after getting severely injured in the accident. The excavator’s operator was also seriously injured.“We are also yet to record his statement. Once his condition improves, we will do that also. As of now, a population of about 7,000 living in various villages across the bridge has been cut off due to the collapse of the lone bridge in the area connecting them to the main town of Pithoragarh,” said Khan. The police officer who had gone to visit the spot to check the repair work said, “The Border Roads Organisation (BRO) have already started the repair work on war-footing and will soon repair it in the next 5-6 days.”The crucial bridge is about 65 km short of the Indo-China border. The trailer was carrying the excavator to Lilam Valley near the border and was to be used in a road project of the BRO. At the time of the incident, construction work was going on for another bridge near the collapsed one which was not in good condition. When the trailer came there, the workers warned the driver not to cross it because the bridge was able to bear a load of only a four-wheeler at a given time. But the driver did not pay any heed and tried to cross it leading to the bridge’s collapse.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/truck-driver-booked-after-bridge-collapse-near-indo-china-border-in-uttarakhand/story-o717JEepWZQcnsM7SGoDjI.html

The platform will allow buyers to filter products based on the country of origin and select those with a high percentage of local content. Buyers can choose to buy only those products that meet the minimum 50% local content criteria.The push for products made in India comes amid rising public clamor for a boycott of Chinese goods as the two nations are engaged in their deadliest border conflict in four decades.The platform, which serves India’s government departments, recorded sales worth 400 billion rupees ($5.3 billion) in the last fiscal year and has 324,000 vendors.Earlier this month, India also modified public procurement rules to give maximum preference to companies whose goods and services have 50% or more local content, with an aim to promote Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s “Make in India” program in response to calls to make the country self-reliant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-takes-another-step-to-block-china-products-with-new-rules/story-w4HFrMuTQncPImfbDz39cM.html

23-06-2020||India||Maharashtra prison inmates can now email to communicate with lawyers: State to HC||Maharashtra government and prison and correctional home authorities informed the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday that inmates would have access to email communication with their respective lawyers with prior permission from the superintendent of a jail apart from the existing calling facilities.Email access is a part of the modified draft guidelines prepared by the state authorities as a precautionary measure to prevent the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak among inmates and jail staff.A two-member division bench of the court, comprising chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice MS Karnik, while hearing a clutch of public interest litigations (PILs) via video-conference was informed that the email access to inmates have been included after considering the petitioners’ recommendations.Maharashtra advocate-general (A-G) Ashutosh Kumbhakoni, who was assisted by additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan, informed the bench that the modified draft guidelines were consistent with the periodic recommendations being made by both the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the state health department authorities.The A-G said all recommendations, pertaining to precautionary measures against Covid-19 for inmates and jail staff, have been incorporated in the modified draft guidelines.He, however, clarified that the recommendations made by senior advocate Mihir Desai on behalf of the petitioner, People’s Union for Civil Liberties (PUCL), a non-governmental organisation (NGO), related to prison reforms were not considered by the state government, as the Supreme Court (SC) is looking into the matter.The court was also informed that postal correspondence with prisoners would also be permitted in the non-containment zones, where such services are operational.The modified draft guidelines stated that an inmate’s family members would be informed within 48 hours if the prisoner tests Covid-19 positive and the inmate would be shifted to a makeshift quarantine centre inside a jail for further treatment.The bench went through the modified draft guidelines and directed the petitioners to submit their suggestions and objections before the next date of the hearing of the case on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-prison-inmates-can-now-email-to-communicate-with-lawyers-state-to-hc/story-DpIQzSwsN5ULSqOvog53lN.html
23-06-2020||India||Coronil: All you need to know about Ayurvedic medicine which claims to cure Covid-19||Yoga guru Baba Ramdev on Tuesday claimed that his company Patanjali Ayurved has made the first Ayurvedic medicine for coronavirus disease Covid-19.The medicine called ‘Coronil’ will help in treating the respiratory disease, claimed Ramdev.“The whole country and the world was waiting for medicine or vaccine for corona. We are proud to announce that the first Ayurvedic, clinically controlled trial based evidence and research-based medicine has been prepared by the combined efforts of Patanjali Research Centre and NIMS,” he said at a press conference in Haridwar.Here is everything you need to know about the new Ayurvedic medicine for Covid-19:• The medicine comes as part of a kit which consists of tablets named Coronil and Swasari Vati, and an oil called Anu Oil. Patanjali Ayurved tweeted to say that they have used active compounds of Ahwagandha, Giloy and Tulsi in the new Covid-19 medicine.• Ramdev said more than 100 compounds have been used in Coronil. The entire kit will help in strengthening immunity.• Patanjali prescribes two tablets should be consumed with hot water half an hour after each meals. This quantity is suitable for people between 15 to 80 years of age, the company says. Chilmdren between the age of 6-14 years can take this medicine, but the dosage should be half of what is prescribed for adults.• According to Ramdev, the company conducted two-stage trials. The first was a clinical controlled study which took place in Delhi, Ahmedabad and many other cities. Under this, 280 patients were included and 100 per cent of those recovered, he said. After controlling the disese and its complications, the all-important clinical control trial was conducted, said Ramdev.• Patanjali claims those administered the medicine were fully cured and none died. Ramdev even claimed that 69 per cent of them recovered within three days. He said that 100 per cent recovery was seen in seven days.• The company said that data of the trial will be released as evidence in the next few days.• The efficacy of Patanjali’s medicine on Covid-19 cure has not been corroborated by any independent medical body as of yet.

The apex court modified its earlier stay on the annual Yatra.The idol of Lord Balabhadra was brought to the chariot by priests and ‘sevayats’ for the Rath Yatra from Jagannath Temple in Puri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagannath-yartra-erstwhile-king-of-puri-sweeps-chariot-with-gold-handled-broom/story-C8TdlWW3ZicDkSnNFE4HVP.html
23-06-2020||India||In a first in Jagannath Rath Yatra, temple priests pull chariots in Puri as devotees stay home||For the first time in its history, the famous Rath Yatra of Jagannath temple in Odisha’s Puri began this morning with a large number of priests pulling the three colourful chariots as lakhs of devotees stayed away from the festival following a Supreme Court order.Around 1,500 priests of the 12th century temple milled around the three colourfully-decorated wooden chariots before they started pulling the ropes of the chariots towards the Gundicha temple amid beating of cymbals and drums in praise of Lord Jagannath and his siblings- Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra. The priests who pulled the chariots, - Nandighosh, Taladwaja and Darpadalana – were tested for Covid-19 on Monday.Gajapati Dibyasingha Deb, Puri’s titular king, who is also the first servitor of Lord Jagannath, carried out the Chhera Panhara, a ritual sweeping of the chariots before they are pulled. “It’s hard to imagine Rath Yatra without devotees on Badadanda(Grand Road). But Lord Jagannath stepped out of the temple for the whole universe,” said Deb. Puri Govardhan Peeth Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati paid obeisance to the trinity atop the chariots along with his disciples.Till Monday afternoon, uncertainty clouded the Rath Yatra as a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court led by chief justice of India SA Bobde heard dozens of intervention petitions seeking recall of the court’s June 18 order that stayed the festival proceedings over fears of mass congregation in the time of the Covid-19 pandemic. For a few days it seemed the Rath Yatra would not be held for the first time in 285 years.The judges on Monday afternoon reversed their decision after an appeal by the petitioners as well as affidavits by the state and Centre arguing that the event had been held continuously for centuries, and even in 1918, when the world was in the grip of the Spanish flu. The apex court agreed to allow the festival with several preconditions including absence of any devotees and pulling of the three chariots by not more than 1,500 priests.In the morning, the district administration had disinfected the 2.5 km long road from the main temple to Gundicha temple. From Monday 9 pm, the police had enforced a curfew around the temple town restricting anyone’s entry or exit for the next 41 hours. “We have mobilised 50 platoons of forces in Puri with two primary objectives – smooth and incident-free movement/pulling of the chariots from origin to destination and restricting entry of unauthorised persons into the town,” said Director General of Police Abhay.Before the break of dawn, there were a flurry of activities in the temple as rituals like Mangal Alati, Tadaplagi, Dwarpala Puja, Besha Sesha, Rath Prathishtha and Mangalarpana started one after another. It was followed by Pahandi rituals of the three deities and Lord Sudarshan where they were carried by the priests from the main temple to the chariots.The devotees, who are an intrinsic part of the festival, remained glued to TV sets as Doordarshan telecast the live proceedings, but they were not unhappy over missing out seeing the deities in person. “It’s all the wish of Lord Jagannath. I am happy with the decision of the Supreme Court. I will see my Lord after the lockdown is over,” said Binapani Mallik, a housewife in Bhubaneswar.Another senior citizen said he was happy to see the Lord come out of the temple. “After the SC order last week, I had given up hope. But I knew that the Lord of Universe would do a miracle to come out on the road and show his face to his millions of devotees,” said Prabodh Mishra, a septuagenarian.On Monday, 1,143 servitors of the temple were tested for Covid-19 of which one tested positive. The servitor who tested positive has been shifted to a Covid hospital before the beginning of the Rath Yatra rituals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-in-jagannath-rath-yatra-temple-priests-pull-chariots-in-puri-as-devotees-stay-home/story-qcT4YY8X2tE4P3FYkhKm3K.html

People who have queued up are seen flouting social distancing norms amid the coronavirus pandemic.The video further shows the minister surrounded by his supporters and several men and women in queue to take blankets and masks. People were also seen bursting firecrackers in the video.When asked about the video, the minister told Hindustan Times, “Some people of a NGO were distributing mask and they stopped me while I was on my way... they asked to distribute masks hence I distributed four-five masks only and left.”Bhagat also said that he couldn’t raise the issue of social distancing as he had to go somewhere. “I had to reach somewhere else to honour Covid-19 warriors, hence I had not talked to anyone and left the place,” said the minister.Chhattisgarh’s state unit of BJP demanded action against Bhagat and said that he should be quarantined.“We are demanding police to take action under relevant sections of IPC and Epidemic Act and further testing of people who in that celebration should be done. The Congress leader are continuously flouting norms during coronavirus pandemic but no action has been taken against them,” said senior BJP leader and spokesperson Sacchinand Upasane.On Monday, the number of active cases in the state was 803 and 1,487 people have been discharged after recovery while 12 others have died.With an increase of 14,933 new cases, India’s Covid-19 count crossed 4.40 lakh on Tuesday. The country has reported a total of 4,40,215 cases and 14,011 people have died.The Union health ministry said that 10,994 patients have been cured in the last 24 hours and the country’s recovery rate has gone up to 56.37 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/video-shows-social-distancing-norms-violated-as-chhattisgarh-minister-distributes-masks-bjp-demands-action/story-W9GgphwnUU3R3ncPCmihpI.html
23-06-2020||India||In a meet with China, Russia, Jaishankar says need to respect ethos of international law||In a thinly veiled dig at China against the backdrop of a tense border stand-off, external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday said the world’s “leading voices” should act in an exemplary manner by respecting international law and recognising the interests of partners.Jaishankar didn’t name any countries in his remarks during his address at a virtual meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia-India-China (RIC), but there appeared to be little doubt about whom he was referring to.He also made a strong case for a greater role for India in the decision-making of international organisations such as the United Nations (UN) and in what India has been describing as a reformed multilateral world order.Watch | ‘Need to respect international law..’: Jaishankar in a meet with China, Russia The special RIC meeting, Jaishankar said, reiterates India’s belief in the “time-tested principles of international relations”.“But the challenge today is not just one of concepts and norms, but equally of their practice. The leading voices of the world must be exemplars in every way,” he said.“Respecting international law, recognising the legitimate interests of partners, supporting multilateralism and promoting common good are the only way of building a durable world order,” he added.A violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 had left 20 Indian soldiers dead – the country’s first fatalities in a confrontation along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) in 45 years.In a phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on June 17, Jaishankar had said the violence and casualties were the outcomes of “premeditated and planned action” by Chinese troops aimed at changing the status quo along the LAC.China has repeatedly sought to blame India for the tensions, saying Indian troops had crossed to the Chinese side of the LAC.It has also claimed sovereignty over the Galwan Valley in Ladakh, though the region has been under India’s control for decades.The RIC meeting, originally scheduled for March but put off due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, was organised at Moscow’s initiative to mark the 75th anniversary of the end of World War-II and the foundation of the UN.Jaishankar referred to the shaping of the world order in the 1940s by the victors of World War-II and said the political circumstances of that era didn’t give India due recognition.“This historical injustice has stood uncorrected for the last 75 years, even as the world has changed. Therefore…it is important for the world to realise both the contribution that India made and the need to rectify the past,” he said, noting 2.3 million Indians had fought in the war and another 14 million had participated in the war production.International affairs, he said, must come to terms with contemporary reality. “The UN began with 50 members, today it has 193. Surely, its decision-making cannot continue to be in denial of this fact. We, the RIC countries, have been active participants in shaping the global agenda. It is India’s hope that we will also now converge on the value of reformed multilateralism,” Jaishankar said.Besides losing its soldiers in battlefields from Tobruk, El Alamein, and Monte Cassino to Singapore, Kohima, and Borneo, India helped keep key supply lines open to Russia and China, he said. “So tomorrow, when our military contingent marches through the Red Square, it would be an affirmation of the difference that we made,” he said, referring to an Indian contingent’s participation in the Victory Day parade in Moscow on Thursday.Defence minister Rajath Singh is in Moscow to participate in the parade and hold meetings with Russia’s top defence leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-stresses-on-need-to-follow-ethos-of-international-relations-ric-meet/story-FUl2sydqAUnoObhCuZ44aO.html
23-06-2020||India||Delhi’s Covid centre, 10 times bigger than China’s largest, to start this week||Home Minister Amit Shah has roped in the Indo-Tibetan Border Police medical personnel to run India’s biggest facility being set up for Covid patients in south Delhi. The facility, being set up at a Radha Soami Satsang Beas complex in Chattarpur, would be able to accommodate over 10,200 patients.The Chattarpur facility, the size of 15 football fields, has been named Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre and Hospital.“This would be 10 times bigger than the field facility for Covid patients that was temporarily set up in China’s Leishenshan to accommodate 1,000 patients,” said a senior Home Ministry official. Back in February, Chinese diplomats had put out a video of the construction of the hospital to showcase what was then considered a feat.Home Minister Amit Shah had earlier this month asked Lt Governor Anil Baijal to reach out to the voluntary sector to help the Delhi government rapidly expand its capacity to accommodate and treat Covid-19 patients. The spiritual organisation, which had earlier operated camps for migrants at some of its facilities in other parts of the country, was the first one to respond to Lt Governor Baijal’s outreach.Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre and HospitalBeds being placed in enclosures spread across 1,10,554 square metreNumber of Enclosures for patients 88No. of enclosures with oxygen supply Patients accommodated in these enclosures 10,200 Nursing Stations 44Number of enclosures of patients 88General Doctors 800Specialist Doctors 70Clinical Supervision 25Nurses 1375Pharmacists/store managers 20The organisation has told the government that it would be able to provide meals for the patients.Shah is expected to visit the facility later this week, possibly Thursday, the deadline for officials to operationalise the first 2,000 beds. The remaining beds are targeted to be set up by 3 July.The facility, an official said, had come to symbolise the growing role played by the Union home minister in scaling up the city’s infrastructure to meet the challenge.The Delhi government had earlier projected that the city’s Covid count would rise to 1 lakh cases by this month-end that would require about 15,000 beds. AIIMS director Randeep Guleria had later indicated that this model may have overestimated the extent of the spread but backed moves to prep for the worst-case scenario.Shah, officials said, had asked the ITBP to help staff the Covid centre’s medical personnel. Once the 10,200 beds are operationalised, there would be a requirement for 800 general doctors and 70 specialist doctors apart from nearly 1,400 nurses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-s-covid-centre-10-times-bigger-than-china-s-largest-to-start-this-week/story-6MPeZcMqhr7wFO8KOfdzMJ.html
23-06-2020||India||‘Mutual consensus to disengage’ reached during top-level India-China military talks||A “mutual consensus to disengage” from “all friction areas” along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) was reached during a marathon meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC on Monday, two senior officials said on Tuesday.The talks that went on for nearly 11 hours were aimed at cooling tensions and thinning the military build-up on both sides of the border.“Modalities for disengagement from all friction areas in eastern Ladakh were discussed and will be taken forward by both the sides,” said one of the officials asking not to be named. The meeting between the delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, began around 11.30 am and went on till 10.15 pm. It was held a week after the brutal clash between soldiers from the Indian Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley.“The Corps Commander-level talks between India and China were held in a cordial, positive and constructive atmosphere,” said the second official cited above who spoke on the condition of anonymity.The Indian side was demanding the pullback of Chinese troops from the Finger Area (a cluster of strategic features in the north bank of Pangong Tso) where the PLA has set up bunkers, pillboxes and observation posts, according to the two officials aware of the developments.They said the army was also demanding the withdrawal of the PLA troops from Galwan Valley, the site of the deadly clash of June 15, and the restoration of status quo ante in key strategic areas.The two officials familiar with the talks at the military level said India was seeking an assurance from the Chinese side on ending aggression along the border after the deadly brawl at Galwan Valley on June 15 and another face-off at Pangong Tso on May 5-6. During both skirmishes, Chinese soldiers gathered in large numbers and attacked Indian troops with stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs.India was also demanding the thinning of Chinese military deployments in “depth areas” on their side of the disputed border, the officials said. The aim of the talks was also to restore status quo in the Finger Area, Gogra Post-Hot Springs and Galwan Valley, they said.According to the officials, the army was especially concerned about the PLA’s presence in the Finger Area, especially Chinese activities between Finger 4 and Finger 8 over the last seven weeks, the officials said. Chinese military positions in the Finger Area restrict the scope of the Indian Army patrolling areas that New Delhi considers its territory.India also flagged concerns about a build-up of Chinese troops, armoured vehicles and artillery units in the Gogra Post-Hot Springs sector, north of Pangong Tso. The army wants the Chinese forces to move back from their current positions to areas where they were in early April.This was the second meeting between the two officers of corps commander rank who earlier met on June 6 when the two sides reached an understanding to implement a de-escalation plan to ease rising tensions along the contested border.But tensions peaked in the aftermath of the June 15 skirmish. It was the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the LAC in 45 years. While the Indian Army lost 20 soldiers, the PLA’s casualties were more than twice of that with Beijing yet to confirm the fatalities on its side.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mutual-consensus-to-disengage-reached-during-top-level-india-china-military-talks/story-sPYmSFW9UWaUWOd5G3CojL.html

The new method which involves every patient to visit quarantine centre, including the mild and asymptomatic cases as well, will add pressure on an already strained government machinery. Sisodia, in his letter, has asked LG Baijal to withdraw the order and also said that the national capital is witnessing nearly 3,000 Covid-19 cases every day and that it not feasible for every patient to undergo clinical assessment at government-run centres. He also said that if a virus infected patient waits for her turn in long queue at such centres, there may be a possibility of spreading the virus.Earlier in an online briefing, the deputy chief minister had asked, “Why should one go to quarantine centre for checkup? Has he made any mistake? At a time when the government should help him, we are giving him punishment of standing in long queues.”Sisodia has also asked lieutenant governor to call a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority and revert to the old system, which was made mandatory through an order last week. The order makes it mandatory for every fresh Covid-19 patient to visit a care centre for a thorough clinical assessment to ascertain whether the patient would need hospitalisation or home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sisodia-writes-to-amit-shah-lg-says-don-t-call-every-covid-ve-patient-to-quarantine-centre/story-2Jg4Gh2aNkJt0iNQwC1HBP.html
23-06-2020||India||Rath Yatra begins in Odisha’s Puri without devotees and amid curfew||The Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath began on Tuesday in Odisha’s Puri without the usual throng of devotees in view of the coronavirus pandemic after the Supreme Court modified its earlier order to give a nod to the annual ritual.The top court had on Monday allowed the state to hold the festival with restrictions in the wake of coronavirus pandemic and said only 500 people shall pull each of the chariots.A curfew has been imposed across Puri district from 9pm on Monday till 2pm on Wednesday, according to Abhay, the director general of police (DGP).More than 50 platoons of the police force—one platoon has 30 personnel—have been deployed and CCTVs installed at various locations as part of the security arrangement for the nine-day festival, officials said, adding, all entry points to Puri were sealed.Priests and police personnel, who were part of the chariot pulling ritual, underwent mandatory Covid-19 testing on Monday night and only those whose reports came out negative were allowed to participate in the festival, they said.Rituals, sanitisationA huge crowd could be seen outside the centuries-old temple as people took part in the colourful procession.Several customary rituals like ‘Mangla Arati’ and ‘Mailam’ were held before the presiding deities—Lord Jagannath, his elder brother Lord Balabhadra and their sister Devi Subhadra—set out from the sanctum sanctorum of the temple. The temple complex was sanitised before the rituals began.The three deities descended from the ‘Ratna Sinhasana’ or the bejewelled throne and were taken out of the temple down the 22 steps known as ‘Baisi Pahacha’ through the Lion’s Gate in an elaborate royal ritual called ‘Pahandi’.The deities moved amid blowing of conch shells and the ringing of bells.Sudarshana, the celestial wheel of Vishnu, was taken out and placed in the chariot of Devi Subhadra followed by Lord Balabhadra and finally Lord Jagannath.Draped in layers of red, black, green and yellow, the three wooden chariots, ready to carry the deities for their annual nine-day sojourn to the Gundicha Temple, waited outside.The 45-feet high Nandighosh, the chariot of Lord Jagannath, stood with 16 huge wooden wheels and Lord Balabhadra’s Taladhawaja is 44-feet high with 14 wheels. Devi Subhadra’s chariot, Darpadalan, is 43-feet high with 12 wheels.Gajapati Maharaja Dibyasingha Deb performed the special ‘Chhera Panhara’ ritual with a golden broom ahead of the pulling of the chariots.News agency ANI tweeted videos, which showed sevayats or those who perform the rituals, playing traditional musical instruments and dancing as others carried the idol to the chariot. “Lord Jagannath likes to watch dance and I’m here to do the same and offer my prayers,” an artist said according to ANI.“We have come for the darshan of Lord Jagannath. I believe that now the corona will go away,” a participating priest was quoted as saying by the news agency. ‘Jai Jagannath’Lakhs of devotees, who have been barred from participating in the grand festival, witnessed the Rath Yatra on television.President Ram Nath Kovind, vice president M Venkaiah Naidu, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik and Union home minister Amit Shah greeted people on the occasion of Rath Yatra.“My heartiest greetings to all of you on the auspicious occasion of Lord Jagannath’s Rath Yatra. I wish that this journey filled with devotion brings happiness, prosperity, good luck and health to the lives of the countrymen. Jai Jagannath!” the Prime Minister tweeted. The Supreme Court gave the go-ahead for the Rath Yatra after taking note of the Odisha government’s assurance that it “can be held in a limited way without public attendance”.A bench headed by Chief Justice SA Bobde on Monday directed the Odisha government to impose curfew in Puri city during the chariots procession after modifying its June 18 order that had said the Rath Yatra cannot be permitted due to the coronavirus pandemic.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rath-yatra-begins-in-odisha-s-puri-without-devotees-and-amid-curfew/story-UTwQffeS5xZD8fY2dV8qCN.html

23-06-2020||India||Covid-19 patients in isolation coaches are all praise for Railways except for mosquitoes||Clean toilets, colour-coded dustbins, comfortable beds, oxygen cylinders and all amenities one can expect in a top class hospital -- the first inmates of the train coaches converted into isolation wards have come away praising Indian Railways for providing a unique solution to care for suspected Covid-19 patients. ¨I am used to travelling by trains, but when I entered this one I was taken aback at the sight of the modifications. The stay was comfortable, except for the mosquitoes which were everywhere. The mosquitoes came from under the beds and they should spray repellent under the seats,” said Krishnakant Sharma, contacted by PTI on phone from Mau in Uttar Pradesh.He and five members of his family, including his wife Neetu and their 11-month-old daughter Vanshika, were among the first group of 59 suspected Covid-19 patients to be admitted to any of the 960 modified coaches deployed as Level 1 Covid-19 care centres across five states.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here In Uttar Pradesh alone 372 such coaches have been deployed. Krishnakant and his family were sent to one such isolation coach after they returned from Mumbai. Their samples were collected at a centre in Mau and they were asked to spend the night of June 20 in the isolation coach to await the results. But all six members of the family tested negative and they were discharged the next day. Two other people were also discharged from the coach. Equipped with hand-held showers, mosquito nets, bio-toilets, power sockets, oxygen cylinders and more, the Covid-care coaches have it all to keep patients comfortable. But controlling the heat in the steel bodied non air-conditioned coaches has been a huge challenge, officials said.Still, the occupants’ fears of being roasted in the heat were unfounded as the night was pleasant, and industrial sized pedestal fans and hay on the roof kept the temperature down. ¨I don’t know what we would have done if the temperature had soared. But I have to say that unlike the reputation of the toilets in trains, the bathroom as well as the toilets in these coaches were clean and it was very convenient to use, even for my elderly mother,” said Krishnakant.Nothing, however, could be done about the swarms of mosquitoes that came in through doors that were kept open, nullifying the effect of the netting that the Railways had fixed on the windows. ¨I spent the entire time worrying that if not coronavirus, my daughter will definitely contract malaria or dengue. Her face and her feet are covered with bites and she was crying all the time,” said Neetu, 32. ¨Click here for complete coronavirus coverage There is no point getting one disease while you are being treated for another right? With rains just around the corner, the railways need to address this issue as soon as possible, otherwise they will have to start testing for malaria and dengue before they release patients from here,” she told PTI by phone. She said while there were three colour-coded dustbins in the coach, no one came to clean them when they got stuffed with food plates and leftovers.Krishnakant noted that the food arrangements were made by the local administration and not the Railways. “It was okay since I cannot demand home food, but just one-and-a-half litres of milk for four babies is definitely not enough. An 11-month-old baby cannot survive on this. At the time we were there, there were three more babies in the coaches. The only thing that they managed to eat was biscuits,” he said.Krishnakant, who works at a furniture store in Mumbai’s Virar area, also had a suggestion for the state government -- please serve more food for the adults and arrange for more milk for the babies. The Sharmas had to get milk from their home in Ranipur, a two-hour drive from Mau.However, he said they all give full marks to the Railways for managing to turn around the coaches and provide so many amenities. In an effort to augment the government’s efforts to build infrastructure to deal with the spread of coronavirus, the Railways has converted 5,321 non-AC sleeper class ICF (older design) coaches and developed them into COVID Care Level 1 centres for patients with mild symptoms or those suspected to have the infection. Suspected and confirmed cases will be kept in separate coaches, officials said. The 960 coaches already deployed include 503 coaches in Delhi and 372 in Uttar Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-patients-in-isolation-coaches-are-all-praise-for-railways-except-for-mosquitoes/story-qk7Qfya25TujKllqFlSUQK.html

The assembly polls in the state are also due in October-November.The RJD, which has eight MLCs, is now left with only three MLCs. The MLCs who defected to JD(U) are Radha Charan Shah (2015), Sanjay Prasad (2015), Dilip Rai (2015), Md Kamar Alam (2016) and Ranvijay Kumar Singh (2016). All the MLCs who joined the JD(U) do not face the anti-defection law as they form the two-third of the total number of MLCs of the RJD. A letter about formal joining of the RJD MLCs was forwarded by chief whip of the JD(U) Reena Devi to acting chairman of the legislative council.Tuesday’s development has made the JD(U) with 21 MLCs as the single largest party in the 75-member council, which presently has a strength of 46 as 29 seats are lying vacant. The BJP has 16 MLCs in the council and also has the support of an independent MLC. The polling for nine seats is schedule on July 6.The development comes at a time when the RJD is facing rough weather and has received ultimatum from smaller parties of the grand alliance. On Monday, former RJD MLA from Raghopur Bhola Rai along with his supporters demonstrated outside former chief minister Rabri Devi’s house protesting the move to give ticket to Tej Pratap Yadav for council seat. Tej Pratap is currently a MLA from Mahua. The protesters threatened to jeopardise the chances of election of Tejashwi Yadav from Raghopur in forthcoming assembly elections.JD(U) sources said that in coming months, more people will leave RJD as people are not “happy with leadership”.Earlier on June 16, a former JD(U) MLC Javed Iqbal Ansari had joined the RJD.The bickering in the grand alliance in Bihar has already intensified with Hindustani Awam Morcha (Secular) led by former chief minister Jitan Ram Manjhi issuing an ultimatum that a coordination committee should be formed in the coalition by June 25, in an apparent bid to mount pressure on the senior ally RJD to start seat sharing talks with the smaller allies.If HAM-S sources are to be believed, Manjhi is contemplating re-joining the JD(U).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-mlcs-from-lalu-yadav-s-rjd-jump-ship-switch-to-nitish-kumar-s-party/story-Qm4YC10yMWcgcTSTSsbbmK.html

23-06-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi hits out at Modi government over border standoff with China, economic crisis, fuel hike||Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Tuesday said India has been hit by a terrible economic crisis, a pandemic of huge proportions and a full-blown crisis on the border with China due to the “mismanagement” and “wrong policies” of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government.“It is said ‘misfortunes do not come singly’. The cumulative effect is widespread misery, fear and danger to the security and territorial integrity of the country,” she said in her opening remarks at a virtual meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body.Gandhi sharpened her attack on Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his government on the border standoff with China.“True to its character, the government is in denial. The intrusion was detected and reported on May 5. Instead of a resolution, the situation deteriorated rapidly and there were violent clashes on June 15-16. Twenty Indian soldiers were martyred, 85 injured and 10 went ‘missing’ until they were returned,” she said.“The Prime Minister was called out when he announced that ‘no one had intruded into Indian territory in Ladakh’,” Gandhi said in reference to Modi’s remarks at an all-party meeting on June 19, that neither anyone is present in Indian territory nor any Indian post had been captured by the Chinese.The Congress party says Modi’s stand contradicted past remarks by defence minister Rajnath Singh, foreign minister S Jaishankar and army chief Gen MM Naravane on the Chinese intrusions. Former premier Manmohan Singh on Monday said a prime minister must be mindful of his words on a nation’s strategic interests, insisting China should not be allowed to use Modi’s words as a vindication of its position that it did not enter the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).Gandhi reiterated her party’s support to the government in its efforts to deal with the situation.“On matters of national security and territorial integrity, the nation has always stood together and this time too, there is no second opinion. The Congress party was the first to offer its total support to the armed forces and the government,” she said.However, she contended the government has gravely mishandled the situation. “The future is yet to unfold but we hope that mature diplomacy and decisive leadership will inform the government’s actions in protecting our territorial integrity,” she added.Gandhi urged the government to ensure that peace, calm and restoration of status quo ante along the LAC remain the only guiding principles in India’s national interest. “We will continue to closely watch the situation,” she asserted.She criticised the government over the state of the economy and its stimulus package, saying the crisis has worsened. She stressed the need for immediate financial aid for micro, medium and small enterprises (MSMEs) and direct cash transfers to the poor.“The Modi government refuses to listen to good advice. The need of the hour is a massive fiscal stimulus, putting money directly in the hands of the poor, protecting and nurturing the MSMEs, and stimulating demand,” she said. “Instead, the government announced a hollow financial package that had a fiscal component of less than 1% of GDP.”On the continuous rise in fuel prices, Gandhi said the government has added “insult to injury” by mercilessly raising petrol and diesel prices for 17 consecutive days, at a time when world prices of crude have fallen. Oil companies hiked auto fuel rates for the 17th day in a row by 20 paise a litre and 55 paise respectively on Tuesday. Diesel is costlier by Rs 10 per litre in just 17 days and petrol by 8.50 a litre.“The result is that a sliding economy is now hurtling toward a recession for the first time in 42 years. I am afraid there will be high unemployment, falling incomes and wages, and lower investment. Recovery is likely to take a long time, and that too only if the government corrects its course and adopts sound economic policies,” she said.Gandhi said when the Covid-19 pandemic hit India in February, the Congress offered its total support to the government and backed the nationwide lockdown.“Within weeks, it was apparent that government was totally unprepared to manage the fallout of a lockdown. The result was the greatest humanitarian crisis witnessed since 1947-48. Millions of migrant workers, daily wage earners and self-employed were devastated. One hundred and thirty million jobs are estimated to have been lost. Crores of MSMEs have been shut, perhaps forever,” she said.Despite the assurances of Modi who “centralised all authority in his hands”, Gandhi said the pandemic continues to rage.“The grave deficiencies in the health infrastructure have been exposed. The promised ‘peak’ is nowhere in sight,” she said, alleging the Centre has passed the buck to state governments, but given them zero extra finances.“Actually, the people have been left to protect themselves as best as possible. The mismanagement of the pandemic will be recorded as one of the most disastrous failures of the Modi government,” Gandhi said, and thanked Congress workers for their help and support to migrant workers and other affected people during the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-hits-out-at-modi-government-over-border-standoff-with-china-economic-crisis-fuel-hike/story-P1Tcx5TpumjZhChaNloN2O.html

DM Agra has alleged that Priyanka Gandhi’s tweet, stating 28 Covid-19 deaths occurred within 48 hours in Agra, was wrong and has caused confusion, triggering a wave of fear.Gandhi took to Twitter again on Tuesday and while clarifying her previously made statement, reiterated that the district recorded 28 Covid-19 deaths “within 48 hours of hospitalisation”. आगरा में कोरोना से मृत्युदर दिल्ली व मुंबई से भी अधिक है। यहाँ कोरोना से मरीजों की मृत्यदर 6.8% है। यहाँ कोरोना से जान गंवाने वाले 79 मरीजों में से कुल 35% यानि 28 लोगों की मौत अस्पताल में भर्ती होने के 48 घण्टे के अंदर हुई है।‘आगरा मॉडल’ का झूठ फैलाकर इन विषम परिस्थितियों..1/2 pic.twitter.com/HUMx9LNU1qThe DM, however, has sought denial of the wrong facts mentioned by Priyanka Gandhi within 24 hours. “The news of the “death of 28 Corona patients admitted in the last 48 hours” is untrue,” District Magistrate Agra tweeted out on Monday. Priyanka Gandhi in her tweet on Monday alleged that 28 deaths of Covid-19 patients have occurred within 48 hours of hospitalisation in Agra, Uttar Pradesh. She had targeted the Uttar Pradesh government for its ‘No Test- No Corona’ policy and had blamed the state government for hiding “true facts”. संलग्न नवभारत टाइम्स द्वारा अबतक हुए कुल कोरोना पॉजिटिव मरीजों की मृत्यु के सम्बन्ध में डेथ ऑडिट का हवाला दिया है। पिछले 109 दिनों में #Agra में अबतक कुल 1136 केस एवं 79 मृत्यु हुयी है। "पिछले 48 घंटों में भर्ती हुए 28 कोरोना मरीजों की मृत्यु" की खबर असत्य है।@UPGovt@PrabhuNs_ https://t.co/9XtEIervvyOn Monday, Agra DM, in his tweet, denied the contents which Priyanka Gandhi claimed in her tweet and described them to be untrue. On Tuesday, Singh sent a notice to Congress national secretary.“The tweet by congress national general secretary prima facie gives an impression that 28 deaths occurred in Agra within 48 hours. Such false tweet demoralises the Covid warriors and fighters when whole nation is fighting to stop the spread of Covid-19. Such false tweet has created a wave of fear and casts wrong impression amongst masses,” stated DM Agra in his notice.“The correct facts are that in last 109 days, there have been 1,139 Covid-19 positive cases found in Agra and 79 Covid-19 patients died in this duration. It is totally wrong to allege that 28 deaths have occurred in 48 hours in Agra,” he further added.DM Singh has called upon Priyanka Gandhi to issue a denial of her statement within 24 hours so that no confusion prevails in mindset of common men and the moral of Corona fighters and warriors is not affected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-refuses-to-budge-after-up-govt-sends-notice-says-situation-in-agra-worse-than-delhi-mumbai/story-ESNqcJ2Lg7WjtBIdUibxDO.html
23-06-2020||India||No Haj for Indian pilgrims in 2020||Saudi Arabia will allow only a limited number of its citizens and foreigners already in the country to perform the Haj pilgrimage this year because of the Covid-19 pandemic and risk of infections spreading in large gatherings.In a statement issued on Monday, Saudi Arabia’s ministry of Haj said a “very limited number” of pilgrims of various nationalities who already reside in the country will be able to perform the Haj since the pandemic has spread to more than 180 countries and there is no vaccination or a cure for Covid-19.This means no foreigners will be allowed into the country for the pilgrimage.“The decision was taken to ensure Haj is performed in a safe manner from a public health perspective while observing all preventative measures and the necessary social distancing protocols to protect human beings from the risks associated with this pandemic and in accordance with the teachings of Islam in preserving the lives of human beings,” the statement said.It added that this decision “stems from the top priority [the Saudi government] accords [to] maintaining the safety of pilgrims on its land until they depart to their home countries”.There had been widespread speculation that Saudi Arabia could put off this year’s pilgrimage because of the Covid-19 crisis – the first time such a step would have been taken in history. The country had earlier suspended the entry of Umrah pilgrims.Saudi Arabia has registered 161,000 Covid-19 cases and 1,307 deaths. More than 105,000 people have recovered. Saudi authorities do not release data on infections among expatriates, though hundreds of Indians have been infected and 17 had died till April. Saudi Arabia is home to nearly 3 million Indians.In New Delhi, union minority affairs minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said he had been informed of the Saudi decision by Haj minister Mohammad Saleh bin Taher Benten. Naqvi said fees collected for applications from more than 213,000 pilgrims will be returned without cancellation deductions through direct transfer.He tweeted, “The process has been started today to immediately refund full amount of money deposited by the applicants without any deduction. The money will be refunded through online DBT mode into bank accounts of the applicants.”In 2019, Saudi crown prince Mohammed bin Salman accepted the Indian government’s request to increase the country’s Haj quota from 170,000 to 200,000. Of the 200,000 Indians who performed the Haj last year, 140,000 went through the state-run Haj committee.In 2018, the Indian government got permission from Saudi authorities for single woman to perform the pilgrimage without a male escort. Naqvi tweeted 3,040 Indian women had done the Haj without a male escort since then. He said this practice will continue when the pilgrimage resumes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-haj-for-indian-pilgrims-in-2020/story-hEiqxNj8bmiwaNbb97bevM.html

Joint Operation launched today early morning on own sources inputs corroborated by @JmuKmrPolice,” it said.“An active hideout busted & warlike stores - UBGL with grenades, GPS, AK magazine & administrative stores recovered.

The second militant, Shahid Ahmad Bhat, was a resident of Semthan Bijbehara in South Kashmir, while the third person was yet to be identified.They were affiliated to the Hizbul Mujahideen, a banned local group, and the Kashmir unit of the Islamic State, according to the police, who said the terrorists were working jointly.Security forces have stepped up the offensive in the Kashmir Valley and killed more than 100 terrorists in operations since the beginning of this year.

23-06-2020||India||Govt makes country of origin mandatory for GeM platforms to weed out Chinese goods||The sale of Chinese goods on the dedicated online trading platform for state-run agencies – Government e-Marketplace (GeM) – will now be difficult as the government has made it mandatory for sellers to mention the country of origin of products, officials said on Tuesday. According to the officials, who requested anonymity, the new feature was added to the online marketplace so buyers can make informed decisions and avoid Chinese products.The move came against the backdrop of a tense standoff between Indian and Chinese border troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). Calls for the boycott of Chinese goods and services have increased since 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a violent face-off with Chinese troops on June 15.While registration of new sellers is applicable with immediate effect, a specific mention of the country of origin will be mandatory for existing users.A commerce ministry statement said: “Sellers, who had already uploaded their products before the introduction of this new feature on GeM, are being reminded regularly to update the Country of Origin, with a warning that their products shall be removed from GeM if they fail to update the same.”GeM, a special purpose vehicle under the commerce ministry, has taken this significant step to promote the Make in India and Aatmanirbhar Bharat schemes, it said.The platform has also enabled a provision for indicating the percentage of local content in products in order to promote local goods, it added.“With this new feature, now, the Country of Origin as well as the local content percentage are visible in the marketplace for all items. More importantly, the ‘Make in India’ filter has now been enabled on the portal. Buyers can choose to buy only those products that meet the minimum 50% local content criteria,” the statement said.GeM is dedicated to promote the Make in India initiative. The marketplace has facilitated the entry of small local sellers in public procurement.“GeM is enabling quick, efficient, transparent and cost-effective procurement, especially in this hour of need when government organisations require products and services urgently to fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,” it said.Purchases through GeM by government users have been authorised and made mandatory by the finance ministry in 2017.The e-market for different goods and services is a dedicated procurement portal for government organisations and public sector companies. It aims to enhance transparency, efficiency and speed in public procurement. It provides tools such as e-bidding, reverse e-auction and demand aggregation to facilitate government users achieve the best value for their money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-makes-country-of-origin-mandatory-for-gem-platforms-to-weed-out-chinese-goods/story-tS6o1m9PNfPdP4xqSwLnNP.html
23-06-2020||India||US imposes restrictions on Vande Bharat Mission repatriation flights||The US administration has imposed restrictions on Air India’s repatriation flights, saying the Indian government has been engaging in discriminatory treatment of American airlines by barring them from operating similar flights.An order issued by the US department of transport on Monday said the directive would take effect in 30 days. The order said the US side had taken the action after Indian authorities didn’t address American concerns about “restrictive and discriminatory treatment of US carriers” that were first raised on May 19.The order further said Air India will have to file applications for authorisation for repatriation flights at least 30 days before the date of the proposed flight.There was no immediate response to the US action from Indian officials.India plans to operate a total of 96 flights to various cities in the US between June 12 and July 2 under the third phase of Vande Bharat Mission, the country’s largest repatriation programme for Indian nationals stranded abroad because of the Covid-19 pandemic. These flights won’t be affected by the order.India significantly ramped up flights to the US and Canada in the second and third phases of Vande Bharat Mission to being back stranded citizens, including students and professionals who lost their jobs because of the economic fallout of the pandemic.The US order said Air India was being notified that it “will be required, effective 30 days after the service date of this Order, to obtain prior approval from the Department…before operating any Third- and/or Fourth-Freedom charter flights to or from the United States”.“We are taking this action because the Government of India (GoI) has impaired the operating rights of US carriers and has engaged in discriminatory and restrictive practices with respect to US carrier services to and from India,” it said.Air India is currently the only foreign air carrier from India that has authorisation from the US department of transport to conduct operations to and from the US with its own aircraft and crew. Air India’s permit authorises it to conduct scheduled and charter rights.The order contended the Indian side had imposed restrictions that prevent US carriers from making full use of charter rights as they have been barred from conducting passenger charter operations “involving direct sales to individual passengers or through other distribution systems”. It added the US hasn’t placed any limitations on Air India’s charter operations.Air India has been conducting repatriation flights to the US since May 18. “On May 19, 2020, an official from the Department [of transport] advised Air India of the Department’s concerns that some, if not all, of Air India’s so-called evacuation charters have gone beyond true evacuations (at least on the India to the United States segments) and involved sales to any member of the general public able to enter the United States,” the order said.Delta Air Lines had sought permission from India on May 26 to perform repatriation charter services but had not received approval, the order said. The order also accused Air India of using the repatriation charter flights “as a way of circumventing the GoI-imposed prohibition of all scheduled services” since March 25.“This situation, in which Indian airlines are permitted to perform services pursuant to their rights under the Agreement while US carriers are not, creates a competitive disadvantage for US carriers vis-à-vis Indian carriers...,” it said, adding the US embassy had first registered its objections with the Indian government on May 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-imposes-restrictions-on-vande-bharat-mission-repatriation-flights/story-RyFaDP3MxucnBtcP7Lt8nJ.html

Sonia Gandhi says -:"Now, we have a full-blown crisis on the LAC with China.....The future is yet to unfold but we hope that mature diplomacy and decisive leadership will inform the government’s actions in protecting our territorial integrity."Twenty Indian Army soldiers, including a commanding officer, were killed in the attack by the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15.Sonia Gandhi also said that the need of the hour is a massive fiscal stimulus, putting money directly in the hands of the poor, protecting and nurturing the MSMEs and stimulating demand.“Instead, the government announced a hollow financial package that had a fiscal component of less than 1 per cent of GDP,” she said while slamming the government over the Rs 20 lakh crore financial package. She also raised the issue of the fuel price, which has been raised for the last 17 days in a row.Also read | Galwan Valley clash: Chinese commanding officer among several killed along LAC“The government has added insult to injury by mercilessly raising petrol and diesel prices for 17 consecutive days, at a time when world prices of crude have fallen,” she said.The Congress leader also lashed out at the government over the mounting cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across the country.“Despite the assurances of the Prime Minister who centralized all authority in his hands, the pandemic continues to rage.

Another instance is the crisis on the border, which if not tackled firmly, can lead to a serious situation. I also endorse Soniaji’s remarks,” he said.He had on Monday, in his first reaction over the India-China stand-off, had said a PM must be mindful of the implications of his words on a nation’s strategic interests and that “disinformation” was no substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership.The Congress party has been relentless in its attacks on the government with Rahul Gandhi, P Chidambaram and others questioning the current stance of the ruling dispensation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-cwc-meet-starts-border-tension-with-china-fuel-price-hike-on-agenda/story-v1hZeLtEHcCdtEu6nydn9H.html

The Government e-Marketplace (GEM) has also enabled a provision for the indication of the percentage of local content in products with a view to promote ‘Make in India’. “GeM has taken a significant step towards Aatmanirbhar Bharat and has made it mandatory for sellers to enter the country of origin while registering all new products on GeM,” the portal’s CEO Talleen Kumar told news agency PTI.Sellers, who had already uploaded their products before the introduction of this new feature on GeM, are being reminded regularly to update the country of origin, with a warning that their products will be “removed” from the platform if they fail to update the same, he said.Also read: States to get 50,000 ‘Made in India’ ventilators from Centre to fight Covid-19“With this new feature, now, the country of origin as well as the local content percentage are visible in the marketplace for all items. More importantly, the Make in India filter has now been enabled on the portal. Buyers can choose to buy only those products that meet the minimum 50 per cent local content criteria,” he said.Prime Minister Narendra Modi has been rooting for the need to make India ‘self reliant’ by investing in indigenous products and push country’s ‘Make in India’ cause. “The state of the world today teaches us that an Atmanirbhar Bharat “Self-reliant India” is the only path. It is said in our scriptures - EshahPanthahThat is - self-sufficient India,” PM Modi had said last month while announcing the Rs 20 lakh crore stimulus package amid the coronavirus crisis. “We will make the best products, will improve our quality further, make the supply chain more modern, we can do this and we will definitely do it,” the prime minister had said while emphasising on the need to push for indigenous products and local innovations. “The corona crisis has also explained to us the importance of Local manufacturing, Local market and Local supply chain. In times of crisis, this Local has fulfilled our demand, this Local has saved us. Local is not just the need, it is our responsibility also... Therefore, from today every Indian has to become vocal for their local, not only to buy local products, but also to promote them proudly,” PM Modi had stated.

The loss of Nepalese territory due to the rivers changing course could run into “hundreds of hectare land”, it said.“There is a high possibility that over the period of time, China may develop its Border Observation Post of Armed Police in those territories,” the document by the agriculture ministry’s survey department said.Nepal, which shares a boundary with China in the north, has 43 hills and mountains from the east to west, that act as the natural boundary between the two countries. The two countries have six check posts, essentially for trade.The survey department has assessed that the changing course of 11 rivers had already cost Nepal 36 hectare, or 0.36 sq km, across four of its districts; Humla, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Sankhuwasabha.The encroachment of 36 hectare land by China had been first reported to the KP Sharma Oli-led government last year. There were some street protests after the loss of Nepalese territory to China emerged in the local media But the Oli government, who is accused by his detractors of attempting to cosy up to China’s communist party, played down the encroachment by the Chinese and channeled the public outrage against India over the new maps issued by New Delhi in November last after the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was split into two union territories.Instead, PM Oli went on to amp up the differences with India over Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh spread across 330 sq km in May this year after Chinese intervention helped him survive a rebellion within the party in April. That intervention, however, meant that he had to scrap two ordinances promulgated just five days earlier.Also Read: Nepal PM Oli’s new map tactic had three key objectives. China is the common factorPM Oli had seized the opportunity after defence minister Rajnath Singh opened an 80-km road that ends at Lipulekh Pass on the border with China.Analysts in New Delhi and Kathmandu believe that PM Oli’s hard push to Nepal’s new political map was an effort to whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments targetted at India to consolidate his position in the government and the party. This is why he did, a diplomat in New Delhi said, PM Oli did not inform Parliament before it voted on the map earlier this month that he had ignored an offer of dialogue between the foreign secretaries of the two countries. Instead, he gave parliamentarians the impression that his government was forced to push the envelope since New Delhi had declined his offer for dialogue.New Delhi hardened its position after the map was cleared by parliament this month, asserting that it was for him to create a conducive atmosphere in case he is interested in a bilateral dialogue on the boundary issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-could-set-up-border-outposts-in-encroached-territories-nepal-govt-document/story-UD04e4xBMlTSbXcj2BQh8N.html
23-06-2020||India||Maharashtra sees over 2,000 Covid-19 cases every day for last 37 days||A surge in Covid-19 cases is posing a challenge to the Maharashtra government, with officials expecting a peak in numbers by next month. The state has recorded an average of more than 2,000 cases daily for the last 37 days in a row. This period included 13 days when the number of fresh cases crossed the 3,000-mark. The total cases have already touched 135,796, while 6,283 deaths have been recorded so far. Maharashtra has the highest number of coronavirus infections across the country.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here In the past 37 days since May 17, the state has reported 105,242 cases and 4,04, deaths, according to data released by the state health department. On an average, Maharashtra is recording 2,844 cases per day. On May 17, the state recorded 2,347 cases, crossing the 2,000-mark for the first time.On Monday, it reported 3,721 cases and 113 deaths.The highest single day spike was registered on June 21 with 3,870 cases.State chief secretary Ajoy Mehta said on Monday the situation is in under control and the rise in numbers is static. “I can say the situation of Maharashtra is in control. After relaxations were allowed, fresh cases did rise, but by and large, they are static in nature. I don’t think they will increase until more relaxations are allowed,” Mehta told Marathi news channel ABPMajha. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Another issue of concern for the state government is the percentage of patients succumbing to the epidemic or the rising case fatality rate (CFR), which reached 4.67% on Sunday. About 45.59% of the total deaths in the country are registered in Maharashtra alone.By the end of May, the state had successfully brought down the CFR to 3.26% from 7.41% (with 148 deaths) on April 13. But it has started rising again.“Our CFR is increasing, but a lot of work is silently going on to control it. Clear instructions have been issued to admit patients immediately if any symptoms are found. If patients are admitted early, then the treatment can be started in the golden hour and he or she can be saved from slipping into a serious condition. Our task force of expert doctors is updating the line of treatment on a regular basis and very soon CFR will come down,” Mehta said.Last week, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, during a review meeting, ordered the creation of task forces comprising experts and senior doctors in all districts and divisions to bring down the CFR. The highest single day toll of 186 deaths was recorded on June 21. According to the state government, barring Mumbai, reconciliation of figures for deaths in all districts and municipal corporations has been completed.The recovery rate reached 49.86% after 1,962 patients recovered on Monday. The total number of recovered patients in the state is 67,706. On June 16, the state’s recovery rate was 50.99%.The health department said it has conducted 787,419 tests at public and private facilities across Maharashtra till Monday. Of them, 651,623 people tested negative. This means 17.2% of the total samples tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-sees-over-2-000-covid-19-cases-every-day-for-last-37-days/story-tIJQgQnKc53JAdG3Nfzb8M.html

Jha had said Nepal is not allowing the state to complete the remaining flood protection work on the Gandak barrage and the embankment along Lal Bakeya river, which originates from the neighbouring country and cuts through parts of north Bihar.Rivers flowing from Nepal into downstream Bihar have been a bane for the state during the monsoon season. Last year and also in 2008, the Kosi River breached its embankment in Nepal and caused a flood in Bihar.Bihar carries out repairs of embankments on such rivers in Nepal every year but this year, Nepalese authorities have refused to allow flood prevention work.Jha on Monday wrote to the minister for external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Jal Shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat to intervene at their level and talk with the Nepalese counterparts to resolve the issue.“The work on the Gandak barrage is crucial. It has 18 gates on the Indian side and 18 on the Nepal side. For decades, Bihar’s water resources department has been carrying out restoration work on both sides. There has never been an issue. But this time, Nepal has put up barriers to prevent anti-erosion work on their side,” Jha said.The minister said on the right side embankment on the Lal Bakeya river, work has been stopped for about 500 metres connecting India with Nepal.“Nepalese authorities are claiming it to be no man’s land, while there has never been any issue here in the last 30 years,” he said.In April, the Nepal government had given its nod to the Centre for carrying out anti-erosion work on its side in the midst of lockdown. The Bihar government had taken up the matter with the Centre after there were hurdles created in carrying out routine anti-erosion work at vulnerable points on the Kosi river before the monsoon.India’s ties with Nepal have, of late, turned for the worse after the Himalayan neighbour staked a claim on Indian territories of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura in Uttarakhand. The Nepalese parliament passed a constitutional amendment earlier in June to show the disputed areas as part of Nepal.Before that, an Indian was killed by Nepalese border guards in Sitamarhi, a first such incident in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-calls-meeting-after-nepal-obstructs-embarkment-repairs/story-EdRGAxY30wlgNvKTKvgd2O.html
23-06-2020||India||BJP’s JP Nadda takes on Rahul Gandhi’s jibes over India-China stand-off, cites MoUs||JP Nadda, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) president, on Tuesday accused Rahul Gandhi of trying to “divide the nation” and “demoralise” the country’s armed forces as he questioned the Congress leader over his jibes at the Centre’s handling of the border tension with China.The BJP president’s latest tweet has added to the war of words between the ruling party at the Centre and the opposition over last week’s border violent standoff with China in the Galwan Valley in eastern Ladakh. Twenty Indian Army soldiers, including a colonel, were killed in the deadly clash with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh on June 15.Since then the Congress party has been relentless in its attacks on the government. On Monday, former prime minister Manmohan Singh said a PM must be mindful of the implications of his words on a nation’s strategic interests and that “disinformation” was no substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership.Rahul Gandhi has alleged that PM Modi surrendered Indian territory to the Chinese and said he hoped Prime Minister Narendra Modi will “politely” accept Singh’s advice for the betterment of India.Even on Tuesday, the former Congress president kept up with his criticism of the government in a tweet. चीनी आक्रमण के ख़िलाफ़ हम एकजुट खड़े हैं।क्या भारतीय ज़मीन पर चीन ने कब्ज़ा किया है? pic.twitter.com/YCEd0P20aUAfter Rahul Gandhi’s tweet, Nadda asked whether it was the “effect” of the memorandum of understanding (MoU) the Congress had signed with the Communist Party of China.“First, Congress signs MoU with the Chinese Communist Party. Then, Congress surrenders land to China. During Doklam issue, Rahul Gandhi secretly goes to the Chinese embassy. During crucial situations, Rahul Gandhi tries to divide the nation and demoralise armed forces. Effects of MoU?” Nadda asked in a tweet.The BJP president was referring to the MoU signed by the two parties in 2008 to facilitate high-level exchange between them and consult each other over important regional and international issues. Rahul Gandhi, who was a Congress general secretary then, and Xi Jinping had signed that MoU in 2008. Xi was a senior functionary of his party during that period and is now China’s president, Nadda also posted a photograph with his tweet with the timeline of what he said was the “story of a MoU and its effects”.This is the second time Nadda has hit out at the Congress, alleging that its leaders were demoralising the Indian Army.He had, in a series of tweets, questioned Manmohan Singh’s statement over the June 15 brutal clash in Galwan Valley.“Dear Dr. Singh and Congress Party, Please stop insulting our forces repeatedly, questioning their valour. You did this post the air strikes and surgical strikes. Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times. It’s never too late to improve,” Nadda had tweeted on Monday.Before that, he had questioned the Congress party on the same lines while addressing a virtual rally in Rajasthan on Sunday.“When we are fighting in Galwan, a leader is damaging the morale of forces with his tweets. He is showing his limited intellect,” he said.“(He is asking) why have our forces gone unarmed. Don’t you know international treaties? And they didn’t go unarmed. Why are you exposing your limited intellect?” Nadda asked.The senior BJP leader had said India’s defence forces were capable of protecting its borders everywhere.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-s-jp-nadda-takes-on-rahul-gandhi-s-jibes-over-india-china-stand-off-cites-mous/story-ykxaotvKjyDQGkGiIQ5VlO.html

He asked the Dr Singh and his Congress party to not insult India’s soldiers and claimed that 600 Chinese incursions took place during the former prime minister’s tenure.Today, Congress leader P Chidambaram hit back saying Nadda should ask Prime Minister Narendra Modi about the 2,264 Chinese incursions since 2015.“BJP President @JPNadda asked ex-PM Dr Manmohan Singh to explain the 600 Chinese incursions into India between 2010 and 2013. Yes, there were incursions but no Indian territory was occupied by China and no lives of Indian soldiers were lost in violent clashes,” Chidambaram said in his first tweet on Tuesday.In the series of tweets that followed, the Congress leader again took his party’s line in attacking the PM Modi-led government over Ladakh face-off.“Will @JPNadda please ask the present PM to explain the 2264 Chinese incursions since 2015? I bet he will not dare to ask that question,” Chidambaram said in his second tweet. Will @JPNadda please ask the present PM to explain the 2264 Chinese incursions since 2015?

Do these not point to Chinese incursions into and occupation of Indian territory?” Chidambaram said in his final tweet in the series.While attacking Dr Singh, BJP chief Nadda had said on Twitter on Monday that he and his Congress party should stop insulting the security forces repeatedly and questioning their valour.“Please stop insulting of forces repeatedly, questioning their valour. You did this post the air strikes and surgical strikes. Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times. It’s never too late to improve,” Nadda said on Twitter.The comment came in reaction to a statement by Dr Singh about the face-off between the Indian and the Chinese Army in Ladakh last week.Dr Singh said Prime Minister Narendra Modi should be always mindful of the implications of his words, a reference to the controversy stoked by Prime Minister Modi’s comments at an all-party meeting on Friday. The former prime minister also said that the government must rise to the occasion to ensure justice for Colonel B Santhosh Babu and other jawans who were killed in action. The BJP reacted by accusing the Congress of politicising the issue. “One only wishes the Dr Singh was as worried about Chinese designs when, as PM, he abjectly surrender hundred square kilometres of India’s land to China. He presided over 600 incursions made by China between 2010 to 2013!” Nadda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ask-pm-modi-about-2-264-chinese-incursions-since-2015-chidambaram-hits-back-at-nadda/story-edO1HeikhGNJENDfo0yLCM.html

On Monday, the commanders discussed developments along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the army’s readiness to handle any situation.In Leh, senior officers will brief Naravane on latest developments along the LAC and progress in military dialogue with China, said a second person. The person added that Naravane will meet the soldiers who were injured in the Galwan Valley clash and are currently undergoing medical treatment at a hospital in Leh.This will be Naravane’s second visit to Ladakh sector after the border standoff began in early May. He earlier visited Leh on May 22. The army chief is expected to visit Kashmir on Wednesday. The current situation along the LAC marks the first major flare-up since the 73-day standoff between India and China at Doklam near the Sikkim border in 2017.Naravane is visiting Leh a day after top military commanders from the two sides held a marathon meeting at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC with a focus on cooling tensions and thinning the build-up on both sides of the border.Also read: In marathon talks, India seeks de-escalation, Chinese retreatThe meeting on Monday between delegations led by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, commander of 14 Corps, and Maj Gen Liu Lin, commander of PLA’s South Xinjiang military region, went on for almost 11 hours.The Indian side is demanding the withdrawal of Chinese troops from the Finger Area (a cluster of strategic features on the north bank of Pangong Lake) and the removal of bunkers, pillboxes and observation posts the PLA has built there, as reported by Hindustan Times on Tuesday.It is also pressing for restoration of status quo ante in strategic areas such as the Gogra Post-Hot Springs sector and the Galwan Valley.Last week, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria made a low-key visit to Ladakh to review the Indian Air Force’s preparedness in the region, where the IAF is operating its fighter jets and new attack and heavy-lift helicopters.Apart from Sukhoi-30s and upgraded MiG-29 fighter jets, the IAF is operating Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters --- both imported from the US --- in the Ladakh area.Also read: China’s blame narrative continues, says India ‘initiated’ Galwan clashPeople familiar with the talks at the military level said India is seeking an assurance from the Chinese on ending aggression along the border, after the brawl at Galwan Valley on June 15 and another face-off at Pangong Tso on May 5-6. During both skirmishes, Chinese soldiers gathered in large numbers and attacked Indian troops with stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs. Twenty Indian soldiers died in the June 15 clash. India is also demanding the thinning of Chinese military deployments in “depth areas” on their side of the disputed border.India has flagged concerns about a build-up of Chinese troops, armoured vehicles and artillery units in Gogra Post-Hot Springs sector, north of Pangong Lake. The army wants the Chinese forces to move back from their current positions to areas where they were in early April.This was the second meeting of the two senior commanders, who earlier met on June 6, when the two sides reached an understanding to implement a de-escalation plan to ease tensions along the border.But tensions peaked in the aftermath of the June 15 skirmish. It was the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the LAC in 45 years. While the army lost 20 soldiers, the PLA’s casualties were more than twice that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-to-visit-leh-today-as-border-tensions-with-china-simmer/story-piNdT3slN7RZgMjhE8goVM.html

Goods from Siliguri are shipped to Bihar and the North-East as well. So far, five people have died in Darjeeling district where the number of Covid-19 cases stood at 296 till Sunday. Siliguri has so far recorded more than 170 cases. Sunday witnessed the highest single-day spike in the town with 25 new cases. Fourteen cases were recorded on Monday.Incidentally, Siliguri Regulated Market, the largest fish, vegetable and fruit market in north Bengal was closed down by the administration more than a week ago after some people who regularly visited the market were infected. Ward number 46 in Siliguri Municipal Corporation area, where the market is located, has the highest number of Covid-19 cases.Most of the fish, vegetable and fruit sold in the market are shipped to Darjeeling hills, Sikkim and other parts of north Bengal.On Monday, traders at Bidhan Market, the biggest general goods market in Siliguri with around 4,000 shops, decided to suspend business till June 28. Their counterparts at the jewellery market in Deshbandu Para will keep shops closed till June 30. Hong Kong Market, the hub of foreign goods principally of Chinese origin and having around 500 shops, will remain closed till June 30, the traders said.Bhabotosh Saha, secretary of the Hong Kong Market traders’ body said, “The rise in Covid-19 cases has forced us to close the market for eight days. The spike is alarming people.” A few days ago, two local journalists, veteran Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader and former minister Asok Bhattacharya, who is chairman of board of administrators of the municipal corporation, and Raju Shah, general secretary of Bharatiya Janata Party’s Siliguri organisational district committee, tested positive for the coronavirus disease.Bapi Saha, secretary of the traders’ body at Bidhan Market said, “With 20 cases being reported a day on an average it is better to have fewer people on the streets.”Traders at Seth Srilal Market, however, are opposed to the suspending business. Khokan Saha, secretary of the traders’ union, said, “Another shutdown would mean another blow to business.” The market has around 1,000 shops.Surajit Paul, secretary, North Bengal Industries Association said, “Closing down markets is not the solution when we need economic activities to increase.”Last week, 16 trade and transport organisations in Darjeeling town had decided to suspend business for a week but called it off after meeting district administration officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-covid-19-cases-spiking-traders-suspend-business-in-north-bengal-s-biggest-town/story-SXq1KXK8zI0SVuGb2w5hfM.html
23-06-2020||India||Mumbai terror attack accused Tahawwur Rana not a flight risk: Attorney to US court||Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, who was rearrested in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, is not a flight risk, his attorney has told a US court and proposed a $1.5 million bond for his release.Rana (59), was recently released from jail on compassionate ground after testing positive for Covid-19. However, he was rearrested in Los Angeles on June 10 following an extradition request by India.US District Judge Jacqueline Chooljian of the Central District of California has scheduled his bond hearing for June 30.“Rana should be released on a robust bond: secured by approximately USD1.5 million in property pledged by family and friends and under the supervision of his daughter, Lemaan Rana, a matriculating medical student and Ph.D. candidate,” Amy Karlin, the Interim Federal Public Defender said in the court submission on behalf of Rana.India seeks his arrest on a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating, and murder under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He is sought for his role in 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.Karlin argued that the criminal charges against Rana are largely identical to those for which he already went to trial -- namely, that Rana conspired with his childhood friend and Pakistani-American Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist David Coleman Headley to carry out the terror attack in Mumbai which left 166 people, including six Americans, dead.Arguing that Rana can show he is entitled to bail pending his extradition proceedings, his attorney told the court that as was the case there, any concern about his risk of flight is mitigated by both his substantial bond package and the difficulties he would face in leaving the country.Rana faces health risks above and beyond what are faced by all individuals facing extradition, especially in light of the Covid-19 pandemic. What is more, his extradition challenge will present a “substantial question” with a high likelihood of success. Finally, as the District Court Illinois already found, Rana’s release would not endanger the community, the attorney said. Rana’s youngest daughter, Lemaan Rana, a US citizen has volunteered to act as the third party custodian for her father and to act as a surety on an unsecured bond in any amount set by the Court, Karlin said. Lemaan graduated from the University of California, Berkeley, in 2017, and currently works as a Graduate Student Researcher at Smith-Zhang Laboratory. Rana’s apartment in Berkeley was inspected by United States Probation in furtherance of Rana’s anticipated compassionate release and was deemed an acceptable place for him to live. “Should Ms. Rana move in the near future to Illinois (a move which will depend, in part, on the Covid-19 pandemic and whether her medical school classes will happen in person in the fall), Mr. Rana could live with her there. Ms. Rana has been in constant contact with her father during his years of incarceration. She stakes her entire future on his appearance in court,” his attorney said. The US government has opposed his bail arguing that if he were to flee to Canada, he may escape the possibility of a death sentence in India.“Given the stakes, allowance of bail in any amount would not guarantee Rana’s presence in court. Granting bail would invite the possibility of embarrassing the United States in the conduct of its foreign affairs, straining its relationship with India,” Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian told a federal court in Los Angeles last week.However, Karlin said that it is highly unlikely that Rana could somehow sneak across the border and remain there unnoticed, much less find someone in the United States to assist him in that criminal effort.Moreover, if he had the inclination, assistance, and wherewithal to somehow make it to Canada, he would be subject to being extradited back to the United States for a supervised release violation, putting him back in the same position he is now, the attorney said.“The risk that Mr. Rana will flee is miniscule. The court can and should accept this proposed bond package and fashion stringent conditions to further assure Mr. Rana’s appearance. For example, Mr. Rana could be placed on home confinement with electronic monitoring, and his internet use could be subject to monitoring by probation,” she said.Further Rana suffers from a number of severe chronic health conditions that have worsened during his term of incarceration, the attorney said.He has suffered not one but two heart attacks while in federal custody. While Rana had been diagnosed with asthma and hypertension prior to incarceration, since being incarcerated he has been diagnosed with chronic renal failure (Stage II), chronic coronary heart disease, hypothyroidism, enlarged prostate, calcium deficiency, and acute coronary syndrome, the attorney said.Rana has undergone cardiac catheterisation, angiogram, angioplasty, and has had a heart stent inserted due to coronary blockage. He has also suffered two vasovagal events (loss of consciousness) while in federal custody, triggered by myocardial infraction and heart disease.His doctors have advised that he will require dialysis due to his chronic renal failure, and is, of course, at risk for an additional heart attack or vasovagal event, the attorney said.The US government is likely submit its response later this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-terror-attack-accused-tahawwur-rana-not-a-flight-risk-attorney-tells-us-court/story-onpQsI61GiYMPDMJ0xwH2H.html

They are brought out of the temple every year on the second day of the third Hindu month of Asadha onto the Bada Danda street of Puri in three huge chariots accompanied by Sudarshana Chakra.* The nine-day Rath Yatra, or the chariot procession, celebrates this annual journey of Lord Jagannath and his two siblings from the 12th-century Jagannath Temple to Gundicha Temple, 2.5km away. The Gundicha Temple is their aunt’s home.* The rituals for Rath Yatra will begin at 3am inside the 12th-century shrine. * The Pahandi ritual (procession) will begin at 7am and the deities will board the chariots at the Singha Dwara facing towards the Gundicha Temple by 10am. The Chherapahara ritual will be held at 11.30am. The chariots will be pulled thereafter at around 12pm.Also read: How Centre, nudged by PM Modi, made a case for Rath Yatra in Supreme Court* The three deities are taken in the massive wooden chariots weighing 85 tonnes each. After staying in Gundicha temple for nine days, the three deities come back to the Jagannath Temple on the 10th day in a return journey.* Lord Jagannath’s chariot Nandighosa is 45.6 feet in height and has 18 wheels. The 45- feet chariot of Lord Balaram comes with 16 wheels and is known as Taladhvaja and Devadalana is Goddess Subhadra’s 44.6 feet chariot with 14 wheels. * The chariots are built every year only from a particular type of tree.* Thousands of devotees pull the chariots to their aunt’s temple, the Gundicha Temple. It is considered to be a good omen and is also believed to bring luck and success if one gets a chance to pull the chariots.* The deities stay at the Gundicha Temple for nine days, after which they ride the chariots back to their Jagannath Temple, a journey known as Bahuda Jatra.* The chariots on the way back stop at the Mausi Ma Temple or home of Lord Jagannath’s aunt. The deities are offered Poda Pitha, a special pancake which said to be the favourite of Lord Jagannath, at the Mausi Ma Temple.* In the 425 years of the Rath Yatra, the event has been stopped 32 times, mostly during invasions. * It was not held for the first time in 1568 when Kala Pahad alias Kala Chand Roy, a general of Bengal king Suleiman Kirrani, attacked the temple and pillaged the deities.* The last time it could not be held was between 1733 and 1735 when Mohammed Taqi Khan, deputy governor of Odisha, attacked the Jagannath temple, forcing the shifting of the idols to Ganjam district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rath-yatra-in-puri-pulling-the-chariots-of-lord-jagannath-and-his-siblings/story-aotsOejZbaWLUrnxjuqDVJ.html
23-06-2020||India||Rath Yatra begins today after Supreme Court nod: Curfew, no devotees this year||The Supreme Court on Monday allowed authorities in Odisha to hold the annual Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath and his siblings in Puri as it recalled its June 18 order that prohibited this year’s celebrations amid the coronavirus pandemic.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde set several conditions, including the imposition of a curfew in Puri during the nine-day festivities, and asked the Jagannath Temple administration committee and the Odisha government to strictly adhere to them.“If it is possible to ensure that there is no public attendance, we see no reason why the Rath Yatra cannot be conducted safely along its usual route from temple to temple. Having given serious consideration to the matter and having heard the parties, we are of the view that the Rath Yatra at Puri may be held,” the bench, also comprising Justice Dinesh Maheshwari and Justice AS Bopanna, said.Rath Yatra, or the chariot journey, celebrates the annual visit of Lord Jagannath and his two siblings —Balabhadra and Subhadra from the 12th-century Jagannath Temple to their aunt’s place in Gundicha temple, 2.5km away.The three deities are taken in massive wooden chariots weighing 85 tonnes each. They come back to the Jagannath Temple on the 10th day in a return journey after staying in Gundicha temple for nine days.Here is what the top court said:The court ordered all entry points to Puri, including railway stations and bus stands, to be closed during the festival. * The state government shall impose a curfew in the city of Puri on all the days and during all the time when Rath Yatra chariots are taken in procession, the order said.* During the period of curfew, no one would be allowed to come out of their houses or their places of residence, such as hotels, lodging houses, it said.* Each Rath or chariot shall be pulled by not more than 500 persons and they must be tested for Covid-19. * They shall be permitted to pull the chariot only if they have been found negative, the court said. * The court said that all those pulling the chariots should maintain social distancing before, during and after the Rath Yatra. * There should be a gap of one hour between two chariots, the court added.* All of those engaged in pulling the chariot shall maintain social distancing before, during and after the Rath Yatra.* The committee in-charge of Puri Jagannath Temple Administration will have the primary responsibility for conducting the Rath Yatra in accordance with these conditions.* The bare minimum number of people shall be allowed by the committee to participate in the rituals and the Rath Yatra.* The rituals and the Rath Yatra shall be covered by the visual media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rath-yatra-begins-today-after-supreme-court-nod-curfew-no-devotees-this-year/story-PDMhvR7YbzEcWpUn2hsUOJ.html

23-06-2020||India||Delhiwale: A tribute to the king of fruits||It is the time of the year when a Mirza Ghalib devotee could offer at his tomb in Hazrat Nizamuddin Basti a tribute that would have made the poet very happy.Yes, one is thinking of mangoes — Ghalib had a weakness for wine and mangoes. And lest you forget, amid all the depressing news about the coronavirus, Delhi is amid its mango season.In the book Ghalib: Life And Letters, authors Ralph Russell and Khurshid-ul-Islam quote the poet writing in a letter that he “would eat them (mangoes) until my belly was bloated and I could hardly breathe”. In another letter, comparing mango to wine, Ghalib says, “I thought of each mango as a sealed glass, filled with the liquor of grape, and filled with such superb skill that not so much as a single drop spilled from any of the sixty-five glasses.”The authors ascribe Ghalib’s memoirist Altaf Hussain Hali with a famous mango anecdote about the poet, that also highlights his cheekiness with the powerful: “One day…(Emperor) Bahadur Shah, accompanied by Ghalib and a number of other courtiers, were walking in the Hayat Bakhsh or the Mahtab Garden. The mango trees of every variety were laden with fruits, but the fruits of this garden were reserved exclusively for the king and his queens and members of the royal family. Ghalib looked at the mangoes repeatedly, and with great concentration. The king asked him, ‘Mirza, what are you looking at so attentively?’ Ghalib replied with joined hands, ‘My Lord and Guide, some ancient poet has written:Upon the top of every fruit is written clear and legibly:‘This is the property of A, the son of B, the son of C.’And I am looking to see whether any of these bear my name and those of my father and grandfather.’ The king smiled and the same day had a big basket of the finest mangoes sent to him.”One afternoon, in the Walled City’s Ballimaran neighbourhood, famous for being Ghalib’s final address, a milk shake vendor was at work—he was too shy to disclose his name. The pavement stall did not have the usual electric mixer. Instead, the young man was preparing the shake in a steel container called dhol, which was lined with crushed ice. The container itself was wrapped in a wet jute bag that cooled the shake by evaporation. The man was churning the mango pulp, mixed with milk and sugar, by a hefty metal ladle. “Some people also add lemon juice and call it aam ki shikanji,” he said. He was serving the shake in plastic cups.The aforementioned mango lemonade is not seen in the newer parts of Delhi. Indeed, many mango-based dishes, which were a common sight in our city’s dining rooms until a few decades ago, are gradually disappearing. Aam ka meetha pulao, for instance, is a mango-based dessert that is no longer easily available in eateries across the city. “It was a traditional dish in Old Delhi homes, but now it’s a rarity and you can have it only in a few families,” said cookbook author Sadia Dehlvi, who referred this reporter to her cousin Farah Noor. “I inherited this recipe from my grandmother,” says Ms Noor, who lives in Noida. Explaining that the preparation time is half an hour, she generously gave away the making of the rare dish.Aam ka meetha pulao Ingredients (for 2-3 people)250g rice 2 mangoes (preferably Alphonso), thinly sliced 1/2 cup mawa/khoya 3/4 cup sugar 1/4 cup desi ghee 2 clovesMethodBoil the rice till three-fourths done. Throw away the water. Place a layer of rice on a flat pan. Layer it with khoya followed by mango slices. Sprinkle the sugar over the fruit slices and top with another layer of rice. Sauté two cloves in the ghee in a separate pan and add the mixture on to the rice. Put the pan on dum (slow-cook) for 15 minutes. Mix the pulao just before serving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-a-tribute-to-the-king-of-fruits/story-Bo4e0bo4sPqaRJM3hyOivK.html
23-06-2020||India||How the world’s strictest lockdown affected India||The preferred first step to control Covid-19 by most countries was a lockdown. On March 25, when India had reported only 500 cases, the country went into what was one of the strictest lockdowns in the world. This first set of curbs remained in place till April 14 and was extended four times, each time with gradual relaxations. The rest of the world adopted different models.STRATEGIESAn analysis of countries with the highest Covid-19 cases shows most of them have not relaxed lockdowns without a decline in daily cases. In fact, some continue with the strictest measures even after several days of fall in cases or have only reduced the stringency marginally. Those who haven’t followed these two paths seem to find it difficult to continue reducing daily cases. To be sure, this could also mean that a lockdown, although necessary, isn’t a sufficient enough measure to contain the infection.On June 18, 15 countries with the most Covid-19 cases in descending order were: United States, Brazil, Russia, India, United Kingdom, Spain, Peru, Italy, Chile, Iran, Germany, Turkey, Pakistan, Mexico, and France. Most of these 15 countries can be categorised into two groups based on the daily number of cases (we consider a seven-day rolling average to smooth out daily fluctuations): those with a rising number of cases, and those that have seen a decline in daily cases. The former group comprises India, Pakistan, and three of Latin American countries: Brazil, Chile, and Mexico. Of these five countries, India and Pakistan imposed the harshest lockdowns. The stringency index – a number given by the Oxford Covid-19 Government Response Tracker to the harshness of the lockdown imposed – of India’s March 25 lockdown was 100. The highest number recorded for Pakistan was 96. These two countries also relaxed the lockdown the most without the infection slowing its spread. The number hovered around the 80 mark for Brazil, Mexico, and Chile. The former two relaxed the lockdown marginally recently, while Chile made it slightly more stringent.Countries that have seen a significant decline from the peak of their daily cases – viz. rest of the countries excluding Iran – have also reduced the stringency of their lockdowns only after a consistent decline, or have made no or minor relaxations. The latter group includes the United States, which officially made no relaxations; and Turkey and United Kingdom, which gave a marginal relaxation. In the US, however, the strictness number is 72.7.France, Spain, Italy, and Germany have given more relaxations, but only after the peak. Russia, which relaxed its lockdown marginally in the middle of the peak, has seen its number of daily cases stagnate. Saudi Arabia, 16th on the list of countries with the highest cases on June 18, relaxed its lockdown very fast after the cases peaked, and has seen a second wave. So has Iran, which imposed a less strict lockdown to begin with, and has since made only a small reduction in the stringency.Though there is no consensus on, or way to determine, which strategy is the best, a few things are clear: it’s a good idea to impose lockdowns early, make them as strict as possible, and from a spread of disease standpoint, lift them only after the peak. To be sure, factors such the cost of the lockdown – higher for developing than developed countries – may not always allow this. India is a case in point because it imposed the earliest and strictest lockdown, but eased restrictions before cases peaked.NATURAL RELIEFOne good thing the restrictions brought was a breath of fresh air, literally. As people stayed at home, factories, cars, buses fell silent, giving the planet a much-needed (albeit temporary) relief. The air quality in Delhi – notorious for air pollution – improved. The average of PM2.5 concentrations was far better in 2020 compared to 2019 in the period of the lockdown. PM2.5 refers to particles with diameter less than 2.5 micrometers in the air. As the lockdown began to be eased from the second half of May, PM2.5 concentration in Delhi nearly went back to 2019 levels. To be sure, even in the lockdown period, air pollution in the city wasn’t always better than that in 2019. For example, in the April 13 to April 17 period, the concentrations were near the “good” and “satisfactory” range both in 2019 and 2020. This could have occurred last year because there were rains in this period, which might have cleared the air of pollutants. EMPLOYMENTData from the Consumer Pyramids Household Survey (CPHS) of the Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy (CMIE) shows the unemployment rate in India rose to 23.8% in the week ended March 29 – the week when the lockdown was introduced – from 8.4% in the preceding week. This was the highest unemployment rate since the survey started in 2016. This was accompanied by a drop in the labour force participation rate (LFPR) – the share of people looking for work – to 39.2%, the lowest since the survey began. Although these numbers are not to be taken at face value – CMIE reported problems in data collection in the lockdown –they do indicate the direction of two things. One, people stopped looking for work due to the lockdown. Two, a higher than usual share of people looking for work didn’t find any. As the lockdown progressed, LFPR continued to drop and reached its lowest level in the week ending April 19, when the lockdown was slightly reduced. LFPR recovered to 38.7% in the last two weeks of May – the last phase of the lockdown. The unemployment rate has, however, not followed the trajectory of the stringency of the lockdown as much as LFPR. Although it did reach a high of 27% in the week ending May 3, when the second phase of the lockdown ended, it mostly hovered around the 24% mark for most of the lockdown period, dropping to 20.2% only in the last phase of the lockdown. POWER DEMANDAs most activity dropped across the country in the weeks following March 25, the demand for power fell as well, according to data gathered by the Brookings India Electricity and Carbon Tracker. An analysis of this data shows that in the first week of March 2020, the demand for power saw an average drop of 1.2% compared to the same period in 2019. In the week between March 25 and March 31, at an average the year-on-year demand for power fell 31.4%, the data shows.In the final week of May, which corresponds with the end of the fourth phase of the lockdown, the average demand for power saw a marginal rise, though it still remained 17.3% below the average demand in the same time period last year. LIFE IN LOCKDOWNMobility of peopleGoogle publishes Covid-19 Community Mobility Reports for 131 countries to show how the lockdown affected the movement of people. The report uses “aggregated and anonymised data to chart movement trends over time by geography” across a range of places such as grocery stores, parks, workplaces and places of transit. WorkplacesMovement at offices and workplaces dropped to its lowest in the recorded time frame touching -72% on March 25 — the day the nationwide lockdown kicked off. It averaged in the late minus 60s till the end of the second phase of the lockdown, from when it started showing a gradual recovery.ResidentialThere was a 30% increase from baseline in mobility around residential areas on the first day of the lockdown. This remained more or less the same through the next five weeks, with the only fluctuations recorded on Sundays. Through May, however, movement around residential areas started dropping every week. Transit hubsWhen the lockdown kicked off, movement at transit hubs such as trains and metro stations dropped 73% from the baseline. In the four weeks since, it recovered slightly and continued to remain around 60% below baseline.Retail and recreationThere was 77% drop in movement at retail and recreational locations across the country on March 25, the first day of the lockdown. This remained low the next few weeks, hovering around 80% through April and most of May, dropping as low as -87% on April 18. Through May, however, activity started recovering slightly by the end of the fourth lockdown. In the week ending June 14, activity continued to remain low, averaging -59%. Grocery and pharmacyThere was 77% drop in movement at retail and recreational locations across the country on March 25. This remained low the next few weeks, hovering around 80% through April and most of May, dropping as low as -87% on April 18. Through May, however, activity started recovering slightly by the end of the fourth lockdown. In the week ending June 14, activity continued to remain low, averaging -59%. ParksThis was one of the fields studied in the report that has shown the least recovery. On May 25, data shows that 54% fewer people were logged in and around parks across the country. This went on to drop to as much as -68% by the end of March. And though it since recovered slightly, movement at parks remained -56% on June 14 – the latest day for which data is available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-the-world-s-strictest-lockdown-affected-india/story-hi96OxJcyZe53JHb5f6gwN.html
23-06-2020||India||Man, sentenced to death for killing son-in-law, acquitted by Madras HC||The Madras high court acquitted on Monday a man found guilty of the daylight killing of his son-in-law, a Dalit, and commuted the death sentence handed to five others in connection with the gruesome crime that sparked public outrage in Tamil Nadu over four years ago. A division bench of justices M Sathyanarayanan and M Nirmal Kumar acquitted B Chinnaswamy, the father of Kausalya and a member of the dominant Thevar caste, and relieved him of all charges, including criminal conspiracy. The court sentenced five others to life imprisonment for a minimum of 25 years without right to remission.Kausalya’s husband, Shankar, 22, was hacked to death in front of her in Tirupur district’s Udumlapet on March 13, 2016, a chilling crime that was captured on a closed circuit television camera (CCTV). Kausalya, then 19, suffered serious injuries in the attack. The couple fell in love while studying in an engineering college in Pollachi, and married against the wishes of Kausalya’s family in 2015. In December 2017, the Tirupur district sessions court sentenced six people, including Chinnaswamy, who was accused of being the mastermind, to death. Of the 11 accused in the case, three people — Kausalya’s mother, maternal uncle and a minor — were cleared of all charges. Two others got lesser sentences.Chinnaswamy and the other convicts petitioned the high court against the verdict. The five sentenced to 25 years in jail on Monday were the men who were hired to kill Shankar, according to a report on The News Minute. Chinnaswamy’s lawyer, ARL Sundaresan, told the website that the prosecution was not able to prove any conspiracy between Chinnaswamy and the gang. In a statement released on social media, Kausalya condemned the verdict and said she will continue to fight for justice. “I will fight until my Shankar gets justice,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-sentenced-to-death-for-killing-son-in-law-acquitted-by-madras-hc/story-3tdITyPHW62kthi8GRy8eN.html
23-06-2020||India||Covid-19 outbreak: Export of 5 million PPE suits a month on cards||The Centre is likely to allow the export of nearly five million personal protective equipment (PPE) suits a month, officials aware of the matter said, as India moves from not making enough suits to making more than it needs, and global demand remains strong. The suits are critical in the fight against Covid-19, preventing infections, especially in high-risk health care settings. The textile industry has been seeking permission for the exports citing PPE surpluses in the country and losses it has suffered because of the pandemic. A Clothes Manufacturing Association of India survey of around 1,000 factories in May found the industry’s mainstay--apparel sales--plummeted to a historic low of 84% because of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed in late March to check its spread.PPE exports were stopped on January 31. This included all forms of protective equipment including suits made for firefighters and bulletproof jackets. The Directorate General of Foreign Trade (DGFT )on Monday lifted the ban on various kinds of cloth masks that were prohibited in March. However, government officials maintain that the ban on medical equipment is also likely to be lifted soon. Officials from the textile and commerce ministries met the cabinet secretary on Friday to discuss the proposal. “Nearly 50 lakh [five million] PPE suits will be allowed to be exported, to begin with,” said a government official familiar with the matter who asked not to be named. “The decision has been taken at the cabinet secretary-level. However, final orders will be issued by the commerce ministry.”A textile ministry official said several rounds of discussions between different stakeholders have taken place and the decision for allowing the exports is likely to made official before the end of the week. Textile ministry officials acknowledged the PPE production has reached surplus levels and the 20.2 million PPE suits that the government placed orders for in March have been supplied. They said there will be restrictions on the quantum of exports. “We will keep a close watch on the numbers to ensure there is no shortage for our country,” added the textile ministry official who spoke on condition of anonymity. Officials added manufacturers will have to comply with international standards and acquire all required certifications to make sure their products are up to the mark. South India Mills Association President K Selvaraju said there is no market presently for garments or knitwear and that textile companies have been requesting the government to allow them to export PPE kits. He added they have reached a point where they can produce nearly 10 million kits a month. A member of the textile association who asked not to be named , said it would be “surprising if too many PPE suits were exported”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-outbreak-export-of-5-million-ppe-suits-a-month-on-cards/story-xWPand59JAdkKe3CdWAJRK.html
23-06-2020||India||In marathon talks, India seeks de-escalation, Chinese retreat||A week after a brutal clash between soldiers from the Indian Army and China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, top military officials from the two sides held a marathon meeting on Monday at Moldo on the Chinese side of the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) with a focus on cooling tensions and thinning military build-up on both sides of the border. The Indian side was demanding the pullback of Chinese troops from the Finger Area (a cluster of strategic features in the north bank of Pangong Tso) where the PLA has set up bunkers, pillboxes and observation posts, according to two officials aware of the developments. They said the army was also demanding the withdrawal of PLA troops from Galwan Valley, the site of the deadly clash on June 15, and the restoration of status quo ante in key strategic areas.Also Read: India has closed military gap with China along borderThe meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, began around 11.30am and was on till 10.15pm, the officials cited above said. There was no official word from the army till the time of going to print.The two officials familiar with the talks at the military level said India was seeking an assurance from the Chinese side on ending aggression along the border, after the deadly brawl at Gawlan Valley on June 15 and another face-off Pangong Tso on May 5-6. During both skirmishes, Chinese soldiers gathered in large numbers and attacked Indian troops with stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs. India was also demanding the thinning of Chinese military deployments in “depth areas” on their side of the disputed border, the officials said. The aim of the talks was also to restore status quo in the Finger Area, Gogra Post-Hot Springs and Galwan Valley, they said. Also Read: ‘Not bats. They are Batman’: Indian Army’s tribute to Bihar RegimentAccording to the officials, the army was especially concerned about the PLA’s presence in the Finger Area, especially Chinese activities between Finger 4 and Finger 8 over the last seven weeks, the officials said. Chinese military positions in the Finger Area restrict the scope of the Indian Army patrolling areas New Delhi considers its territory.India also flagged concerns about a build-up of Chinese troops, armoured vehicles and artillery units in the Gogra Post-Hot Springs sector, north of Pangong Tso. The army wants the Chinese forces to move back from their current positions to areas where they were in early April.This was the second meeting of two officers of corps commander rank who earlier met on June 6, when the two sides reached an understanding to implement a de-escalation plan to ease rising tensions along the contested border. Also Read: Will ‘Boycott China’ strategy really help?But tensions peaked in the aftermath of the June 15 skirmish. It was the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the LAC in 45 years. According to India’s assessment, while the army lost 20 soldiers, the PLA’s casualties was more than twice that; but Beijing was yet to confirm the fatalities on its side. Meanwhile, both sides have marshalled thousands of soldiers on their respective sides of the LAC, and the military build-up comprised fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns and missile systems.In another significant development, India changed its rules of engagement at the LAC last week, giving complete freedom of action to commanders deployed along the border to handle situations at the tactical level. Commanders are no longer bound by restrictions on the use of firearms and have full authority to respond to extraordinary situations using all resources at their disposal, as reported by Hindustan Times on Sunday. Defence minister Rajnath Singh on Sunday made a detailed assessment of the situation at the disputed border and was briefed by the military brass about the preparations of the armed forces and their readiness to respond to any provocative actions by the Chinese forces. And on Monday, the army’s top brass made a detailed assessment of the ground situation in eastern Ladakh. The developments along the LAC and the army’s operational readiness to handle any situation were discussed at the army commanders’ conference chaired by Army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane.General Naravane will visit Leh on Tuesday for a security review of the Ladakh sector. Senior officers will brief him on the latest developments along the border. This will be his second visit to Ladakh sector after the border standoff began in early-May. He had earlier visited Leh on May 22.On June 13, General Naravane said disengagement of Indian and Chinese forces was taking place in a “phased manner” along the LAC with China where the situation is “under control.” He said the disengagement had begun as a result of military-level talks between the two sides, including the meeting between top Indian and Chinese commanders on June 6.Intense negotiations through diplomatic and military channels, including three rounds of talks between major general-ranked officers, led to the release of 10 Indian soldiers detained by the Chinese side during the June 15 incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-marathon-talks-india-seeks-de-escalation-chinese-retreat/story-LdO1m8CD5ljUTNPHhugAIO.html
23-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||This column is about my favourite topic, testing, but from a different perspective — positivity rates.India’s positivity rate (the number of people testing positive for Covid-19 as a proportion of those tested) has been rising for the past four weeks.The table below captures the average weekly positivity rates for states that report testing data regularly, and also at the national level.India’s positivity rate has increased from 5.37% in the week ended May 24 to 7.74% in the week ended June 21. The World Health Organization says a positivity rate of between 3% and 12% is adequate — or indicates that a country/state/city is testing enough. The view among scientists and doctors at the Harvard Global Health Institute is that anything over 10% indicates insufficient testing.So, why should we worry about a 7.74% positivity rate?Before we answer that, it’s important to understand why progressive positivity rates — or the trend line of positivity rates — matter. Any disease, Covid-19 included, can be said to be on the wane if we find fewer cases as we test more people from the population. Conversely, it can be said to be on the rise if we find more.India’s positivity rate has increased by 2.37 percentage points over the past four weeks. This is a period when overall testing has increased. In the week ended May 31, India conducted 803,616 tests a week, an average of 114,802 a day. This number was 1.176 million, or an average of 168,051 a day for the week ended June 21. Thus, at a time when testing increased, so did the positivity rate — or, as we tested more, we found more (not fewer) positive cases.Statistically, a measure such as the positivity rate will increase with more testing up to a point, and then start decreasing. The positivity rate in many countries may not have followed this pattern (especially because of rules governing who can be or needs to be tested) but it’s easy to see why this should be so — not just for Covid-19 but for just about anything. The number of tests at which the positivity rate starts decreasing is a perfect numerical measure of adequacy (which means it answers a question often posed in this column: how do we know we are testing enough?).India’s aggregate data on positivity rates is muddied by the fact that most states mention the number of samples tested, not the number of individuals. Many states require infected (at least seriously infected) people who have been hospitalised or isolated in an institutional facility to be tested before discharge. Given this, the positivity rates of many states will actually be higher. Tamil Nadu is one of the few states that mentions both the number of samples and individuals tested.So, how should the table accompanying this piece be interpreted? In general, any state where the number is below 10%, and where it has seen an increase and then a plateau or a decrease, can be said to be testing adequately (both conditions have to be met).States where the number is trending upward, despite being below 10%, are clearly not testing enough. And states where the number is above 10% and is continuing to trend upward have a real problem on their hands.Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana (to some extent), and Maharashtra all seem to belong to the third category of states. Telangana and Tamil Nadu (especially the latter) appear to have things under control.But many of the states are seeing an increase in positivity rates (even though the number itself is below 10%).Four weeks may be too narrow a time-frame to base conclusions on, but over a longer period (say eight weeks; and it’s important to pick the right weeks; March and April saw very few cases in India, so, in hindsight, it does not make sense to pick weeks from those months), a trend analysis of positivity rates may be able to tell us when we are testing enough to stay ahead of the disease.Right now, we aren’t.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-xIggQhqnwF5jgIRmPbTm5L.html
23-06-2020||India||Congress pushes for SIT probe into Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh’s Jheerum Valley||Amid a tug-of-war between the Centre and Chhattisgarh government over a fresh case registered by the state police last month in connection with the Jheerum valley ambush by Maoists in 2013, the ruling Congress party in the state asked why the BJP “was afraid of an SIT probe” into the attack.It also alleged a nexus between the opposition BJP and left wing extremists and asked why the National Investigation Agency (NIA) is trying to take over the probe into a fresh FIR lodged last month by Jitendra Mudliyar, son of Uday Mudliyar who was killed in the Jheerum attack.In one of the biggest hits on politicians, Maoists had attacked a convoy of Congress leaders during the party’s ‘Parivartan Rally’ in Jheerum valley on May 25, 2013, killing 27 people. Among the victims were the then state Congress chief Nand Kumar Patel, former leader of opposition Mahendra Karma and former union minister Vidya Charan Shukla who died of injuries a few days later.“Several incidents have come to light in the past that indicate BJP had been working hand-in-glove with the Maoists”, state’s Agriculture Minister Ravindra Choubey and Forest Minister Mohammad Akbar alleged in a joint press conference.Recently a BJP leader was arrested in Dantewada on charges of helping Maoists, Choubey said citing other similar instances.The ministers asked why the BJP was scared of a probe into a “conspiracy angle” into the Jhiram incident.“The BJP does not want the conspiracy angle into the Jhiram attack to be probed. After the NIA took over the probe, they declared Maoist leaders Ganpati and Ramanna as absconders in March 2014 and released information about confiscating their properties in the media. But surprisingly, the names of the two leaders were not mentioned in the charge sheet filed by the NIA in September that year. The NIA investigation into the case derailed after the NDA government came to power in 2014,” they claimed.The conspiracy angle was not even in the terms of reference of the probe Commission set up by the previous BJP government into the incident. The previous government in the state also ignored the demand for a CBI enquiry into the incident, the ministers claimed.After the Congress came to power, it constituted a special investigation team to probe the incident and sought the final report of the case from the NIA so that conspiracy angle can be investigated. But the NIA refused to share any documents with the SIT claiming that the probe was incomplete even as the status of the case on its website showed the probe was completed, Akbar said.Last month, Jitendra Mudliyar lodged a fresh case at Darbha police station seeking to probe the conspiracy angle into the incident. Subsequently, the NIA which works under the Union government, filed an application before the special court (Jagdalpur) on June 16 seeking to take over the probe into the fresh case, he said.The two ministers alleged that the Jheerum attack was a contract killing and asked why the NIA is trying to take over the probe into the new case.Leader of Opposition Dharamlal Kaushik rubbished the allegations and asked the Congress to submit any evidence it had.“When the Jhiram valley incident had taken place, UPA was in power at the Centre. NIA conducted its investigation according to the points of investigation fixed by the then UPA rule. Hence, the Congress should have faith on the investigation conducted by the NIA”, Kahusik said.He asked the Congress to be patient and have faith in the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-pushes-for-sit-probe-into-maoist-attack-in-chhattisgarh-s-jheerum-valley/story-mPxv3ZiCGPaxpCIOr9Qu6O.html

The new video, however, is not from May 9 Naku La clash between more than 150 Indian and Chinese soldiers that left 11 troops injured, the people said. The new video shows around 25 Indian and Chinese soldiers exchanging blows and pushing each other around, with the Indian side seeming to be in control of things. The video has surfaced at a time border tensions between Indian and China are at a peak in eastern Ladakh. Visuals capturing brawls between Indian and Chinese soldiers keep have surfaced on regular intervals.Last month, an undated video and a photograph that captured violent scraps between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh surfaced on social media, bringing the border feud along into sharp focus. The army then said the visuals were “not authenticated” and linking them with the border situation was “mala fide”.While the two-minute-45 second video that surfaced last month ostensibly showed a brawl between troops of the two countries on the banks of Pangong Tso in which the Indian side looked dominant, the photograph showed injured and bleeding Indian soldiers at the receiving end of Chinese aggression.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-video-captures-scuffle-between-indian-chinese-troops/story-Mx5G4hkz6LpBb2sF0reXQO.html
23-06-2020||India||No threat to BJP-led Manipur govt: Sarma||Guwahati: Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma on Monday said there is no threat to Manipur’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led coalition days after the party’s three lawmakers resigned and six others withdrew support to chief minister N Biren Singh’s government.“The situation is more or less under control. We are consulting with all our MLAs [members of legislative assembly] and things will be resolved nicely. There is nothing to worry,” said Sarma, who heads the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance (NEDA). The BJP came to power in Manipur for the first time in 2017 even as Congress emerged as the single largest party in the 60-member House with 28 seats. It secured 21 seats but formed the government with support of other NEDA constituents--National People’s Party (NPP), Naga People’s Front (NPF) and one lawmaker each from the Trinamool Congress (TMC), Lok Janshakti Party (LJP) and an Independent legislator.Three BJP lawmakers resigned last week while four NPP, and the lone TMC and the Independent legislator withdrew their support to the ruling coalition.Sarma and Meghalaya chief minister Conrad Sangma, who heads NPP, flew to Imphal on a chartered flight sort out differences among the coalition partners.“All discussions are taking place in a very positive manner and you will see good results in the next 2-3 days. There is absolutely no worry. Tomorrow [Tuesday], I will go to Imphal again.”He said since the Speaker has disqualified some lawmakers, there could be some difference in the “architecture” of the coalition. “But more or less, we are continuing with the spirit of NEDA... All complaints and grievances will be addressed. There is no question of leadership change,” said Sarma amid speculation that the chief minister may be replaced to bring back NPP into the coalition.NPP legislators quit the government saying they were unhappy with Singh’s way of functioning.BJP’s strength in the Manipur House has come down to 18 with the resignation of its three lawmakers. It still enjoys the support of 4 NPF and 1 LJP legislator and the coalition’s tally is 23.Congress has 20 lawmakers and with support of four 4 NPP, one TMC and Independent legislator, the newly formed Secular Progressive Front (SPF) it leads has 26 legislators.Due to disqualifications and resignations, the Manipur assembly’s strength has been reduced to 52.Despite the reduced numbers, BJP’s Sanajaoba Leishemba was able to win the Rajya Sabha election on Friday securing 28 votes. Congress candidate T Mangibabu’s got 24 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-threat-to-bjp-led-manipur-govt-sarma/story-JaPE1GYThwu0iJoFNsTEyH.html

23-06-2020||India||Closure notice issued to Assam OIL withdrawn||The Pollution Control Board of Assam (PCBA) conditionally withdrew on Monday the closure notice issued to Oil India Limited’s (OIL) Baghjan oil field where a blowout last month sparked an inferno that displaced thousands, spewed thousands of litres of oil and gas into the fragile ecosystem and wreaked havoc on the local wildlife. In a letter to OIL’s resident chief executive based in Assam’s Duliajan, PCBA said the closure notice issued on June 19 was withdrawn following an affidavit by the company to the pollution watchdog that said OIL will submit a detailed timebound environmental management plan within 15 days.Monday’s order – seen by HT – also said OIL will have to apply for consent to operate (CTO) under section 25 of the Water (Prevention And Control) Act 1974 and section 21 of the Air (Prevention And Control) Act 1981 separately each for drilling, production and other installations along with an environmental management plan.“They have to submit all the details of hazardous waste generated, disposed and treatment facilities as per the Hazardous and Other Waste (Management and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2016,” the letter said.DN Das, member secretary of the PCBA, was not reachable for a comment.“Yes they have withdrawn the closure order after we gave them a very detailed affidavit and made a payment of Rs 24 lakh which was for CTO and CTE applications. The payment was pending because of a technical snag,” said Tridiv Hazarika, spokesperson, OIL.The board issued the closure notice on Friday on the grounds that the company has been operating it without prior permissions, including the key “consent to establish” and “consent to operate” clearances.“Baghjan oil field is located just 500 metres to the Maguri Motapung wetland which is part of eco-sensitive zone of Dibru Saikhowa National Park, which is effected severely due to the negligence from your end,” read the closure notice. “You are destroying the aquatic life of Dibru Saikhowa National Park and Maguri Motapung wetland , of endangered species in the name of exploring oil without any mitigation measures,” it added.The blowout that began on May 27 led to the uncontrollable flow of oil from gas well 5 -- causing extensive damage to biodiversity and wildlife the region, according to a preliminary report on the environmental damage caused by the incident. There are 17 oil wells and five gas wells in the Baghjan oil field, which generates 1,200 kilolitres of crude oil and 1.5 to 2 million metric standard cubic metres of gas per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/closure-notice-issued-to-assam-oil-withdrawn/story-3LOvMTGicGKzgqSobogp8I.html
23-06-2020||India||Timely help to Iran helps India check locust attack||Indian agricultural scientists have been successful in tackling the spread of crop-devastating locusts with tight measures and by arming Iran to cut invasions towards India, helping protect 114,026 hectares of crops in six most “at-risk” states as on June 22, according to official data.The most threatened states where locust attacks have been curbed are Rajasthan, Punjab, MP, Gujarat, Maharashtra and UP, as the country robustly heads into its summer-sown kharif crop season. To be sure, India is still among five nations which cannot lower their guard for the next four weeks, the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) has said in its latest alert on June 21. Desert locusts can fly up to 150km daily and a one square-km swarm can eat as much food as 35,000 people in terms of weight in a single day, according to the FAO Desert Locust Information Service manual. The voracious pests, which originate in the Horn of Africa, can flatten farms overnight if not checked. Locust attacks are known to cause considerable drops in food output, roiling farm economies.Since May, India has ramped up containment, in area terms, by 42% (from about 49,000 hectares to nearly 114,026 hectares). One hectare is roughly 2.4 acres.The pests appeared earlier than expected this year. Adult populations set off in thick swarms from Africa, descending and breeding in several countries before entering India via Iran and Pakistan through the so-called Scheduled Desert Areas abutting the country’s western borders.Since April, locusts have appeared in large districts such as Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Bikaner in Rajasthan, Moriana in Madhya Pradesh and Nashik and Nagpur regions in Maharashtra.Among several measures taken to counter the threat, India shipped early this month nearly 20,000 litre of malathion, the main pesticide to control locusts, to Iran under a collaboration to implement strategies control strategies. Containing locusts in Iran help India because the country lies on the invasion route. The pesticide, malathion, at 96% concentration, effectively kill locusts, according to the FAO manual. Authorities maintain stocks of minimum 5,000 litres at this concentration at “location control stations across states where pesticide can be mobilised for immediate requirement, according India’s national manual for locust control”. A surge in locust attacks since last year is being attributed to favourable breeding weather caused by a large number of cyclones in East Africa since last year according to the FAO.According to Anurag Srivastava, spokesperson of the ministry of external affairs, India has developed a regional cooperation mechanism involving South Asians nation to fight the pestilence. Pakistan, however, skipped a technical-level meeting with India on June 19.“There have been no significant findings of crop damage in the locust affected states of Gujarat, MP, Rajasthan, Punjab, Maharastra and UP to new kharif crops, where containment measures and constant surveillance continue,” the official cited in the first instance said on condition of anonymity.Millions of farmers plant a range of summer crops that account for half of India annual food output, driven by good rains. These include rice, pulses, oilseeds and millets, apart from horticulture and sugar plantations. In the last week of May, before kharif plantings, surveillance field units reported between 5% and 10% of crop damage in 1000 hectares in Sriganganagar, Hanumangarh and Bikaner of Rajasthan and 5-10% of 400 hectares in Moraina district of Madhya Pradesh.“India has a good experience of fighting the pest from two previous outbreaks, in 1950 and 1993. This has come in handy,” said JN Thakur, a former chief of locust monitoring at the agriculture ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/timely-help-to-iran-helps-india-check-locust-attack/story-0mVLObWJn2wCip1sg6rnjI.html
23-06-2020||India||Manmohan Singh remarks on India-Sino border tensions stir up row||A Prime Minister must be mindful of the implications of his words on a nation’s strategic interests, former PM Manmohan Singh said in his first public remarks on the Sino-Indian border tensions on Monday, stressing that “disinformation” was no substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership.His statement was an apparent reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s remarks at an all-party meeting on Friday that neither anyone is present in the Indian territory nor is any Indian post captured by the Chinese. The Congress party says the PM’s stand contradicts past remarks by the defence minister and the foreign minister on Chinese intrusion. Singh said China should not be allowed to use the PM’s words as a “vindication” of its position that it did not enter the Indian side, and called upon the government to ensure justice for the 20 Indian Army soldiers killed in a deadly clash with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh on June 15.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) was quick to hit back. The party’s chief JP Nadda termed Singh’s statement “mere wordplay”, asked him not to “share his wisdom” on the Prime Minister’s responsibilities, and accused him of ceding ground to China when he was in power at the Centre.“One only wishes that Dr Singh was as worried about Chinese designs when, as PM, he abjectly surrendered hundreds of square kilometres of India’s land to China. He presided over 600 incursions made by China between 2010 to 2013!” Nadda tweeted, referring to Singh’s tenure as PM.In his statement, Singh said the government’s decisions and actions will have “serious bearings on how the future generations perceive us”. He added that India was at a historic crossroads and those who lead us “bear the weight of solemn duty”. “And in our democracy that responsibility rests with the office of the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister must always be mindful of the implications of his words and declarations on our nation’s security as also strategic and territorial interests,” Singh said.“The Prime Minister cannot allow them [China] to use his words as a vindication of their position and must ensure that all organs of the government work together to tackle this crisis and prevent it from escalating further,” he added.In the wake of a controversy over the PM’s remarks at the all-party meeting, the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO) said on Saturday that there was a “mischievous interpretation” of Modi’s comments, and that the Prime Minister was clear that India will respond firmly to any attempts to transgress the LAC.Singh said China was brazenly and illegally seeking to claim parts of Indian territory such as the Galwan Valley and the Pangong Tso Lake by committing multiple incursions since April. “We cannot and will not be cowed down by threats and intimidation nor permit a compromise with our territorial integrity,” he said.The statement came a day ahead of a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party’s highest decision-making body, which is expected to discuss, among other issues, the India-China border standoff and the prevailing Covid-19 situation in the country.Singh also said “we must stand together” at this moment and put up a united front in response to this “brazen threat”. “We remind the government that disinformation is no substitute for diplomacy or decisive leadership. The truth cannot be suppressed by having pliant allies spout comforting but false statements,” he added.Former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi, who has alleged that Modi surrendered Indian territory to the Chinese, said he hoped the Prime Minister will “politely” accept Singh’s advice for the betterment of India. In his reply, Nadda said the Congress and its leaders should stop insulting the armed forces and Singh should look at his own record. “Please stop insulting of forces repeatedly, questioning their valour. You did this post the air strikes (in Balakot in 2019) and surgical strikes (in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir in 2016). Please understand the true meaning of national unity, especially in such times. It’s never too late to improve,” he posted.“Dr Manmohan Singh can certainly share his wisdom on many subjects but the responsibilities of the office of the Prime Minister aren’t one of them. UPA (Congress-led United Progressive Alliance) personified systematic institutional erosion of that office, combined with disrespect for our armed forces. NDA has reversed that!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manmohan-remarks-on-india-sino-border-tensions-stir-up-row/story-Y8vHkOlqliQ5X0ofLl1EXJ.html
23-06-2020||India||Telangana govt blames Centre as state sees highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases||The Telangana government on Monday blamed the Centre’s Narendra Modi government for the increasing number of Covid-19 cases and the low incidence of testing in the state as it witnessed the highest single-day spike in infections.The state reported 872 new Covid-19 positive cases, the most in a single day so far, taking its total count to 8,674. Seven deaths were also reported during the day.Areas falling under the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Area (GHMC) accounted for 713 of all cases reported on Monday.Criticising the central government, state health minister Eatala Rajender said in a statement that the Modi government had done nothing for the state to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. “It washed off its hands by giving calls to the people to clap their hands and light the lamps,” he said.Rajender alleged that the Centre had even diverted the Covid-19 testing machines ordered by Telangana to other states. He said that the Telangana government had placed an order with Roche Diagnostics Private Ltd in Mumbai in the first week of June for importing three Cobas 8800 Automated Molecular Systems, each having a capacity of testing 3,500 to 4,000 tests for Covid-19, from Frankfurt, Germany.“The first consignment of the instrument was to be imported by the company on June 8. In the meantime, Indian Council of Medical Research had written to Roche Diagnostics last week, instructing that the instrument be diverted to National Institute of Cholera and Enteric Diseases (NICED), Kolkata immediately, on the pretext of national emergency and pandemic scenario,” the minister alleged.However, the state unit of the Bharatiya Janata Party has blamed the KCR government for failure to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state. Several BJP leaders including Telangana unit president Bandi Sanjay were put under house arrest on Monday as they were planning to hold dharna t in front of the Gandhi hospital in Hyderabad. Accusing the BJP leaders of resorting to cheap and dirty politics on Covid-19 pandemic, Rajender said nobody could ever question the integrity and commitment of the K Chandrasekhar Rao government in fighting the virus.“The Centre had washed off its hands by giving just Rs 214 crore to fight the Covid-19 and asking the people to clap and light lamps. The BJP leaders have no moral right to accuse the state government of conducting less number of tests, while the Centre diverted the testing machines being imported by the Centre,” he said.He said the state-run labs at present have the capacity of conducting 2,290 tests per day and it would be increased to another 4,310 tests by next week.According to the health bulletin, 3,189 samples were tested on Monday of which 872 turned out to be positive. Hyderabad accounted for 713 cases, followed by 107 infections from Ranga Reddy and 16 cases from Medchal districts.While 12 cases were reported from Sangareddy, there were six from Warangal Rural, five from Mancherial, three each from Kamareddy and Medak, two each from Jangaon, Karimnagar and Mahabubabad and one case from Warangal Urban.With a cumulative testing of 60,243 samples so far, Telangana has reported 8,674 Covid-19 positive cases that included 217 deaths while 51,569 samples came negative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-govt-blames-centre-as-state-sees-highest-single-day-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-BUKmBjESAAYhi9WRcnyVZP.html
23-06-2020||India||Joint statement unlikely after RIC virtual meeting||A joint statement is not expected to be issued after the virtual meeting of the foreign ministers of the Russia-India-China (RIC) grouping on June 23, being held under the shadow of the India-China border standoff, people familiar with developments said on Monday.External affairs minister S Jaishankar will join his counterparts from Russia and China — Sergey Lavrov and Wang Yi — for the virtual meeting.The people cited above, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the three sides in the RIC grouping were unable to reach agreement on a draft of the statement as there were differences over a few paragraphs. Further details couldn’t immediately be ascertained.India had been reluctant to join the RIC meeting following the June 15 violent face-off between Indian and Chinese border troops at Galwan Valley that left 20 soldiers dead. However, it agreed to do so after a push from Russia, a key strategic ally and military hardware supplier for India.Both Indian and Russian officials have insisted that the June 23 virtual meeting is a trilateral affair — meaning bilateral issues such as the India-China border standoff won’t be on the agenda. The external affairs ministry has said the RIC meet will focus on the fallout of the Covid-19 pandemic, and cooperation within the grouping to tackle challenges to financial stability and global security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joint-statement-unlikely-after-ric-virtual-meeting/story-6A7FeVxAifq5sO1ndPgiZL.html
23-06-2020||India||OIC body rejects Art 370 move||A key body of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) on Monday backed the Kashmiri people’s demand for self-determination and rejected the Indian government’s decision to scrap the special status of Jammu and Kashmir.A virtual meeting of the OIC’s contact group on Kashmir, held on Pakistan’s call, adopted a communique that also expressed concern over ceasefire violations along the Line of Control (LoC) and called on India to “rescind its unilateral and illegal actions, and allow the Kashmiri people to freely exercise their right to self-determination through a UN-supervised plebiscite”.A statement issued by Pakistan’s Foreign Office said the communiqué was unanimously adopted by the contact group.A separate statement issued by the OIC said the contact group reaffirmed continued support for the Kashmiri people and called on the UN secretary-general to make India abide by the UN Security Council resolutions and “engage in dialogue to calm the situation in the region”.The contact group called on India to halt security operations in Kashmir, respect basic human rights, “refrain from changing the demographic structure” of the region and settle the issue under UN Security Council resolutions, according to the OIC statement.The statement added the contact group had welcomed efforts by some OIC members to calm the situation between India and Pakistan.There was no immediate response to the developments from Indian officials. India has traditionally described such actions by the OIC as interference in the country’s internal matters.Pakistan has been pushing for such a meeting on the Kashmir issue since the Indian government scrapped the special status of Jammu and Kashmir last August and split the erstwhile state into two union territories. However, India’s close friends within the OIC, including several Arab states, had stymied these efforts.The communique, according to the statement from Pakistan’s foreign ministry, reaffirmed “support for the legitimate struggle of the Kashmiri people for realization of their inalienable right to self-determination and freedom from Indian occupation” and rejected the “newly-notified Jammu & Kashmir Reorganization Order 2020 and Jammu & Kashmir Grant of Domicile Certificate Rules 2020”, claiming they were “aimed at changing the demographic structure” of Kashmir.The contact group demanded India should halt “human rights violations; stop indiscriminate use of force; lift the unabated military siege and inhuman lockdown; repeal its draconian emergency laws…and release all illegal detainees”.OIC secretary general Yousaf Al-Othaimeen chaired the virtual meeting that was joined by the foreign ministers of Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Saudi Arabia, Turkey and a senior representative of Niger. Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi led the Pakistani delegation, which included the “president” of Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and representatives of Hurriyat from PoK.Qureshi conveyed Pakistan’s concern at the new domicile rules in Kashmir, alleging they were meant to change the demographic structure.

23-06-2020||India||China blames India for face-off, talks on||China on Monday again blamed India for initiating the violent clash in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley last week that left 20 Indian and an unspecified number of Chinese troops dead even as it said the two countries were in touch to resolve the issue through diplomatic and military channels.“The Chinese [side] has repeatedly stated that the rights and wrongs of this incident are very clear and initiated by the Indian side, and the responsibility does not rest with China,” Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson’s office said in a written statement in Mandarin to HT.“China always strictly abides by the agreements signed between the two countries and carries out patrols and duties on the Chinese side of the line of actual control (LAC).”The statement added Beijing hopes that the two sides will “…earnestly implement the important consensus reached by the leaders of the two countries, step up communication and coordination on properly handling the border situation and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity of the border area”.China on Friday released a so-called step-by-step account of the clash. It claimed Galwan Valley “is located on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control in the west section of the China-India boundary” and blamed India for the clash.India rejected the claims of China’s sovereignty over the Valley, calling them “exaggerated and untenable”.At a regular briefing on Monday, the Chinese foreign ministry also refused to share any details of the ongoing military-to-military talks in the region. It stalled a query on the number of casualties that the People’s Liberation Army suffered in the hand-to-hand fighting on June 15 in Galwan Valley.“China and India are in communication with each other to resolve the situation on the ground through diplomatic and military channels. I have no information to release on that,” the ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said.Zhao’s comment was in response to a query on Indian minister V K Singh’s statement on Sunday in which he said China could have lost double the number of soldiers India lost in the clash.The Chinese government has refused to reveal its casualty figures though state-controlled media has said both sides suffered casualties.INDIAN RESPONSE, INDEPENDENT COMMENT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-blames-india-for-face-off-talks-on/story-Mo4FzgBMkcXqU4552WqLeP.html
23-06-2020||India||Delhi govt to give home testing devices, oxygen support access||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said the government will equip every district with oxygen concentrators so that Covid-19 patients are immediately administered oxygen in their homes if the need arises. The chief minister also said that every Covid-19 patient under home isolation will be given a pulse-oximeter device so they can frequently check their oxygen levels and alert the district officials, in case of an emergency. Addressing a digital press conference, Kejriwal said in Covid cases, the biggest concern is that the oxygen levels of the patient drop suddenly and often drastically. “To ensure there is no delay in administering oxygen to such patients, every district administration will now keep a certain number of oxygen concentrators at their disposal so that oxygen is provided to the Covid-19 patient in their homes on an immediate basis. Our teams will reach your home immediately to provide oxygen. If needed, the patient will be shifted to a hospital,” he said adding that phone numbers will be made public in every district for people to avail this service. Kejriwal said the decision was taken after the government observed that on some occasions the lag created in providing treatment to a Covid-19 patient by transporting him/her from their homes to the hospital can result in the worsening of the patient’s condition. The moves comes at a time where there has been confusion over protocols that are to be followed for cases in home isolation, which began after Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, the administrative head of the city, issued an order on Friday that virtually did away with the practice -- before walking back on it on Saturday after it triggered concerns and anger among people. On Sunday, the Union home ministry asked the Delhi government to provide the details of each and every Covid death in the city to assess whether the deaths were because the patients were not taken to a hospital on time or there had been a delay in treating them. According to Delhi’s health bulletin on Monday,there were 12,922 people in home isolation from among the 23,820 active cases.Kejriwal on Monday also said that the government will give pulse-oximeters to every Covid patient under home isolation so they can check their oxygen levels from time to time. “Once the patient’s condition improves, you can return it to us in 10 days or so,” he said. Dr Neeraj Gupta, professor in the department of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the Safdarjung hospital in Delhi said the initiative has been much-needed, especially since the Capital has been recording over 3,000 new cases every day. “This is a time when the number of cases is increasing so rapidly because of which hospital beds need to be optimised. The idea of the Delhi government is to maintain the oxygen level of the patent above 90%, until they recover on their own. Keeping oxygen concentrators handy in every district will help the family of the patient to buy time to search for beds and get admission in an hospital, if the patient is serious or moderately serious,” said Gupta. He said the Delhi government’s decision on pulse-oximeters is in tandem with the central government’s recent scheme through which people can buy these devices at a cost of Rs 1,200. The chief minister, for the first time, directly attacked China for “sending the virus” and “causing troubles at the border”.“Today, the entire world is waging two wars against China. One is against the virus they sent and another is at the border. Against the virus we have our doctors, nurses battling it out. At the borders, there are the armed forces. Our 20 soldiers did not step back, we will also not step back in both these wars,” Kejriwal said. Appreciating the support extended by the Central government in Delhi’s fight against Covid-19, Kejriwal reiterated that this is not the time to do politics or fight among each other. “If we do not units, Corona will win,” he said. The chief minister also said that testing in Delhi has now been increased by over three times and that people should now face no problem in getting themselves tested for Covid. “Earlier around 5,000 tests were being done per day, now 18,000 tests are being conducted per day. All labs have been asked to ramp up and use their resources to full capacity. Antigen tests have also started in Delhi and mild or asymptomatic patients are being treated at home only. Our team calls them to keep a tab on them,” he said.Kejriwal said on June 12, 5,300 beds were occupied and as on Monday, 6,200 beds were filled. “In 10 days, we have seen 23,000 fresh cases, but only 900 beds in hospital have been filled. As many as 7,000 beds were vacant as on Monday afternoon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-govt-to-give-home-testing-devices-oxygen-support-access/story-4ovcUDrRxe4Xh7iPBO5VKK.html
23-06-2020||India||HC stays bail given to principal in Delhi riots case||The Delhi high court on Monday stayed the bail granted to a school principal, who has been charged with allegedly conspiring to “precipitate and aggravate riots” in the national capital in February.A trial court on Saturday granted the bail to Faisal Farooq. It cited CCTV footage and said it did not show his presence at the place where the riots had broken out. It said the charge sheet filed in this case is bereft of material showing his links with other riot accused.The high court issued a notice to Farooq and posted the hearing in the matter for Tuesday. The Delhi police challenged the bail saying he was found to be the “kingpin and mastermind” involving an incident during the riots that involved a mob that entered his school and “create havoc” from its terrace. They have claimed that rioters fired bullets, threw petrol bombs, acid, bricks, stones using an improvised catapult specially installed for the purpose.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta and additional solicitor general Aman Lekhi, who appeared for the police, told the high court that Farooq is an influential person in the area. They cited investigation and added the rioters in Rajdhani School and outside fired indiscriminately and caused losses to life and limb and property.The police have also charged 18 others in connection with the violence at the school. Farooq’s counsel Gaurav Kocchar said though the bail was granted on Saturday, bail bonds and personal surety bonds were to be filled on Monday but the police challenged the order even before the hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-stays-bail-given-to-principal-in-delhi-riots-case/story-dKolAGFKhhOvsmrznE6gsO.html
23-06-2020||India||Serological survey to assess spread of Covid outbreak will start June 27||The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) will carry out the serological survey to assess the Covid-19 spread in the national capital for the Delhi government, a senior official aware of the process said on Monday, as officials in the city administration and the Union health ministry worked out details of how the programme will be launched later this week.The serological survey -- a random test of 20,000 people from across the city to assess if they have in the past been infected by the coronavirus -- was suggested by the Union government in an effort to intensify efforts to contain the outbreak in Delhi, which now has 62,655 cases, second only to Maharashtra’s 135,796, data collated by HT showed on Monday.The survey is scheduled to begin from June 27. “HLL Lifecare Limited is procuring antibody test kits on behalf of Centre for testing in Delhi. And National Centre for Disease Control under the Union ministry of health and family welfare will conduct the sero surveillance for Delhi government,” the senior government official, who asked not to be named, said.Around 20,000 people representing a cross-section of Delhi’s population will be tested across the 11 districts within two weeks under the revamped action plan issued by the ministry of home affairs after a meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday.Antibody tests detect the presence of antibodies produced by the body to fight Covid-19 infection. It helps identify people who have recovered from Covid-19 without being tested because they were asymptomatic, had mild disease, or could not get tested for some reason. Finding these hitherto undetected cases will help the state government estimate the true burden of Covid-19 in Delhi and plan an appropriate response. According to district-level officials, the protocols for the survey are being worked upon. “We have yet to receive the guidelines for sero-surveillance in Delhi. The details will be worked out through out the week. Currently, our teams are focussing on antigen testing,” said a district official, asking not to be named.Delhi started using rapid antigen tests – that can give results in 15 minutes – on Thursday. Over 7,000 people were tested on the very first day, followed by over 12,000 people the next day. This has led to an increase in the number of cases in the city, with 3,000 cases being recorded on Sunday.The focus is likely to be on north-west, central, west, and north districts that have been reporting a high number of cases.It was not immediately clear which antibody test kits will be used, since previous attempts had to be aborted due to problems of reliability. In April, the Delhi government started using antibody testing in hot spot areas to check the prevalence of the infection. Only 62 people were tested using the rapid kits in Nabi Karim, all of which were negative. The government, as per the directions of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), stopped using the antibody kits made by two Chinese company after they showed varying results across the country.“We had placed an order for 50,000 tests in March but cancelled it after Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) stopped antibody tests after kits from the two companies from China were found to be defective. We haven’t placed an order for more kits yet,” said an official from Delhi’s health department.US-based medical devices company Abbott on Monday said it will supply one million laboratory-based antibody testing kits to various states, including Delhi, by the end of June.Earlier this month, ICMR revealed the result of its pilot sero-surveillance study of 26,000 people from across India. The overall percentage of general population that was found to have been infected in the past is 0.73%, with urban areas having shown higher Covid-19 prevalence of about 1.09%, the study had revealed. These tests were carried out by kits made by Ahmedabad-based Zydus Cadila.The ICMR director general Dr Balram Bhargava said the low prevalence rate showed there was no community transmission of the infection in India.With the source of the infection unknown in nearly half the Covid-19 cases in Delhi, the health minister Satyendar Jain had said on June 10 there was transmission of the infection in the community in Delhi, but to term it as ‘community transmission’ was up to the centre. This survey might help answer the question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serological-survey-to-assess-spread-of-covid-outbreak-will-start-june-27/story-vD0VrqSHnPMpdlspRPubWP.html
23-06-2020||India||No exception for pregnant inmates, police tells HC on Safoora’s bail plea||The Delhi Police on Monday asked the Delhi High Court for a day to “seek instructions” on a bail plea by Jamia student Safoora Zargar, charged under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) for her alleged role in the northeast Delhi riots. Justice Rajiv Shakdher, hearing the case through a video conference, allowed this after Zargar’s counsel said she has no objection to it. Before this, the police claimed in the Delhi high court on Monday that Zargar is not entitled to bail on the grounds of pregnancy as the law does not make any distinction in this regard. Police told the court that Delhi’s jails have had many pregnant inmates. They said that in the past 10 years, 39 deliveries have taken place inside the prison.“...there is no exception carved out for pregnant inmate, who is accused of such heinous crime, to be released on bail merely because of their pregnancy. The law provides for adequate safeguards and medical attention during their custody in jail,” police said. Zargar, an MPhil student of Jamia Millia Islamia, approached the court seeking bail on the ground that she is pregnant and has severe medical complications. In the course of the hearing, the police claimed that Zargar was part of a conspiracy to use any means to cause death and injury to people. It also claimed that she was one of the main conspirators in the commission of the serious offence of causing large-scale disruption and riots, not only in Delhi but also in other parts of the country.” The severity of the offence is in no manner mitigated by the factum of pregnancy….,” it added.Zargar was arrested on April 10 for allegedly conspiring with other persons to instigate and start riots in northeast Delhi. At least 53 people died and 400 others were injured in the riots in February. She is seeking bail on the grounds that she has medical complications in her pregnancy. In a status report, Delhi Police said that based on an investigation, a case is clearly made out from the statements of witnesses. Many student groups across Delhi have held protests seeking Zargar’s release. Students bodies and activists have accused Delhi Police of launching a witch hunt against student activists, especially those who took part in protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Zargar earlier told the court she was only part of the protests and has denied the police allegations.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Aman Lekhi represented Delhi Police. During the hearing, advocate Rahul Mehra, the standing counsel of the Delhi government (criminal), told the court that the SG and the ASG ought to have taken permission from the city government to appear in the matter. The court did not weigh in on this. On June 4, a city court dismissed Zargar’s bail plea, stating that “right of speech and expression and for that matter protest or demonstration, is not an absolute right and subject to reasonable restrictions under the Indian Constitution”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-exception-for-pregnant-inmates-police-tells-hc-on-safoora-s-bail-plea/story-73L7OAtRMz2xkPcUXspv5L.html
23-06-2020||India||India increases tech surveillance on Ladakh LAC with Israeli Heron drones||In a stand-off with a belligerent Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at four points in East Ladakh , India has increased technical drone surveillance of the area even as the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has inducted more battalions into the sector to support army along the 3,488 km Line of Actual Control (LAC), government and military officials familiar with the matter said.The decision to induct ITBP battalions in support of the army was taken on June 20 after Director General Military Operations, India, Lt General Paramjit Singh and Director General (ITBP and BSF) S S Deswal visted Leh to be briefed about the ground situation. The top security officials of Indian Government were briefed by the XIV Corps Commander Lt General Harinder Singh on the the stand off with PLA.India has also deployed its specialised high-altitude forces along LAC to repel any transgression in the western, middle or eastern sectors, the officials added.With the Narendra Modi government giving a clear mandate to the Indian Army to repel any PLA transgression along the LAC, the military and the National Technical Research Organization (NTRO) have been asked to deploy more surveillance drones in the area so that the battle theatre becomes more transparent. While the army has been given clearance at the highest levels to acquire more drones, the Israeli Heron medium altitude long endurance drone currently being used by NTRO is providing technical surveillance of the area.The Chinese PLA has the unproven armed drone Wing Loong in its inventory; India is also looking to acquire armed drones from either Israel or the US.According to government officials familiar with the matter, the ITBP force accretion is being done to ensure that all 65 (some say 62) patrolling points along the 1547 km LAC in East Ladakh are fully patrolled , thereby not allowing PLA to expand the scope of its dispute with India by engaging in more areas. The ITBP operates under the Indian Army in the event of hostilities, and also undertakes joint patrols with the military in peacetime; it already has at least 7,000 men on ground. The joint briefing of DGMO, who has served as Corps Commander of Nagrota in J &K, and DG (BSF and ITBP) was done to ensure that the Indian forces are on the same page in case the red flag goes up.Along with the ITBP, specialised forces, trained over the past decades to fight on the northern front, have now been pushed up to the frontier. Unlike the PLA, which moves in infantry combat vehicles that use paved metalled roads, the Indian mountain troops are trained in guerrilla warfare and in high-altitude combat, as demonstrated during the 1999 Kargil War.“The art of mountain fighting is the toughest, as the cost of human casualties is 10 to each troop of the adversary sitting on a height. The troops from Uttarakhand, Ladakh, Gorkha, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim have adapted to the rarefied heights over centuries and hence their capability of fighting is close-quarter combats is without match. The artillery and the missiles have to have pin-pointed accuracy or else they miss the mountain target by miles,” said a former Indian Army chief.The Tibetan plateau is flat on the Chinese side while the Indian side starts from K2 peak in Karakoram, to Nanda Devi in Uttarakhand, to Kanchenjunga in Sikkim, and Namche Barwa across Arunachal Pradesh border. “In mountains, it is not only difficult to capture territory but more difficult to hold it,” a China expert at South Block said.The officials cited in the first instance said that India is willing to play the long game. “Our battalions lined up with armoured personnel carriers and artillery. India will not instigate or precipitate any skirmish but will reply to any transgression. The days of LAC nibbling are over. This is a battle of nerves and India is prepared to wait, come snow come sunshine,” said a senior minister who asked not to be named.The officials added that the Modi government is unhappy that Chinese President Xi Jinping did not rein in PLA western theatre commander General Zhao Zongqi, who, according to China watchers, is keen on imposing the 1960 Eastern Ladakh map based on claims on Indian territory.This map, in which China claims territory up to Kongka La, was unveiled by former Chinese premier Chou En Lai, who led the country during the 1962 conflict. Indian officials said that it was in an attempt to set aside historical baggage that Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiated the Wuhan and Mamallapuram summits so that the two leaders could promote the bilateral relations after the 73-day Doklam face-off in 2017.While both India and China are diplomatically engaged to de-escalate the situation, the instructions to the ground forces are to not to allow any transgression by the PLA at any cost. “ PLA soldiers use vehicles to reach their posts; our troops are trained to climb and then fight . Thanks to adversaries on western and northern borders, Indian infantry has learnt the art of fighting at the highest heights be it Siachen, Karakoram, Lipulekh or Thag la,” said a senior military commander who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surveillance-shored-up-forces-added-in-ladakh/story-e1GBA1qGwodVr1lm2L4LMJ.html
23-06-2020||India||Lockdown to be imposed in 4 areas in Bengaluru after surge||The Karnataka government on Monday decided to enforce complete and full lockdown in four major areas of the city following a sharp spike in Covid-19 cases.Chief minister B S Yediyurappa Yediyurappa chaired a meeting on Monday to take stock of the situation in the state capital and decided to enforce full seal down in – K R Market, Chamarajapete, Kalasipalya and Chickpete.In the recent past the state government has been an active votary for opening up the state for more activities. Yediyurappa in the recent video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi advocated the same. However on Sunday, the state saw its single biggest day jump in Covid -19 cases with 453 new virus cases being registered of which 196 were from Bangalore. On Monday too Bangalore at 126 new cases accounted for half of the Covid-19 cases of 249 registered today. Bangalore (urban and rural) with 958 cases account for nearly a third of all active cases in the state.Incidentally unlike in the past where spikes were due to influx of people coming back from different states, contact history of the new patients indicates that it has been locally transmitted.Briefing reporters after the cabinet review meeting minister for revenue and municipal administration R Ashoka said that some of the quarantined are leaving their phones behind and roaming around. He warned a criminal case will be registered against those breaking rules. The government has also promised to notify tariff rates for treatment in private hospitals shortly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lockdown-to-be-imposed-in-4-areas-in-b-luru-after-surge/story-aOWZBl4SSZt6uvucSlDUfM.html
23-06-2020||India||First 59 patients admitted to Covid care railway coaches in UP||The first batch of 59 suspected Covid-19 patients was last week admitted in Uttar Pradesh to train coaches converted into isolation wards to deal with the pandemic, the railway ministry said on Monday.The railways modified 5,231 coaches and converted them into isolation wards two months back for deployment across the country to boost health infrastructure . They had since remained unoccupied.The Centre has deployed 960 such isolation wards in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Madhya Pradesh. Over half of the coaches (503) have been pressed into service in the national capital, one of the worst-hit places by the pandemic in the country, followed by Uttar Pradesh (372).Forty-two suspected patients were admitted to the isolation coaches deployed at Mau Junction in Uttar Pradesh on June 20 followed by 17 on Sunday. Eight of these patients have been discharged, the railway ministry said.The railways has handed over the isolation coaches to the chief medical officers of the concerned states and they are supposed to deploy doctors and paramedics for them as per the Union health ministry’s procedures. It has said it will deploy two liaison officers for each location to assist the state governments.The isolation coaches can be used for patients with mild symptoms and in areas where states have “exhausted the facilities” and need to augment capacities for isolation of both suspected and confirmed cases, according to the railways.The first Covid-19 coaches with 160 beds were deployed at Delhi’s Shakur Basti railway station on May 31.The 372 Covid-19 coaches in Uttar Pradesh have been deployed at 23 locations, including Lucknow, Varanasi, Bhadohi, Faizabad, and Saharanpur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-59-patients-admitted-to-covid-care-rly-coaches-in-upheadline/story-BgCPhf8CXLeKkEuj5UgOaP.html
23-06-2020||India||Sonia Gandhi urges PM Modi to provide free foodgrains for 3 more months||Congress president Sonia Gandhi urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday to provide free food grains for another three months from July in view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation across the country, saying millions of Indians are at risk of slipping into poverty due to the lockdown.In a letter to the prime minister, she said the provision for supply of 5 kg free food grains per person every month to Antyodaya Anna Yojana and priority households under the National Food Security Act from April-June in addition to regular entitlements was announced at the beginning of the lockdown.The government also announced free food grains of 5kg per person every month for migrants not covered under any central or state public distribution system (PDS) scheme for May and June, she added.“The union government must consider extending the provision for free food grains for a further period of three months i.e. from July-September 2020. Several States have requested for the same,” Gandhi said.Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had in May announced providing 800,000 tonne of emergency ration for migrants under the Union government’s Atma Nirbhar Bharat programme for distribution during May and June.The Congress chief also urged the Prime Minister to issue temporary ration cards to all poor households who continue to be excluded from the PDS system.“Nearly three months since the country went into a strict lockdown, millions of Indians are at risk of slipping into poverty. The adverse impact on livelihoods has led to chronic food insecurity for both, our urban and rural poor,” she wrote in the letter. “In light of the current situation, food entitlements must be expanded to address the hunger crisis facing some of the most vulnerable people in the country,” added Gandhi.She urged the Prime Minister to announce the decision at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-urges-pm-to-provide-free-foodgrains-for-3-more-months/story-quQ8jr2jig1l3H9gwmvCjI.html
23-06-2020||India||SC nod to Rath Yatra, but public not allowed||The Supreme Court allowed authorities in Odisha on Monday to conduct the famed Rath Yatra of Lord Jagannath in Puri, recalling its June 18 order that prohibited this year’s celebrations in view of the coronavirus disease outbreak.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde set several conditions, including the imposition of a curfew in Puri during the festivities, and asked the Jagannath Temple administration committee and the Odisha government to strictly adhere to them. This year’s Rath Yatra will begin on Tuesday.“If it is possible to ensure that there is no public attendance, we see no reason why the Rath Yatra cannot be conducted safely along its usual route from temple to temple. Having given serious consideration to the matter and having heard the parties, we are of the view that the Rath Yatra at Puri may be held,” the order by the bench, also comprising justices Dinesh Maheshwari and AS Bopanna, said.All entry points to Puri, including railway stations and bus stands, will be closed during the festival, the court ordered. “The state government shall impose a curfew in the city of Puri on all the days and during all the time when Rath Yatra chariots are taken in procession. During the period of curfew, no one would be allowed to come out of their houses or their places of residence, such as hotels, lodging houses...,” the order said.In a special sitting, the top court was hearing over a dozen applications by individuals and associations seeking recall of its order delivered on Thursday. The applications, including by Janardhan Pattajoshi Mohapatra (the hereditary chief servitor of Lord Jagannath of the Jagannath Temple), found support from the central and Odisha governments with both favouring holding the festival without public participation.“Each Rath, i.e., chariot, shall be pulled by not more than 500 persons. Each of those 500 persons shall be tested for the coronavirus. They shall be permitted to pull the chariot only if they have been found negative,” the court said. All those pulling the chariots should maintain social distancing before, during and after the Rath Yatra, and there should be an interval of one hour between two chariots, the court added.Hours after the order, Odisha government imposed a 41-hour curfew in Puri and started Covid-19 testing of 700 temple priests who would pull the three chariots. Health and family welfare department said 700 servitors would undergo Covid-19 tests and only those who test negative will be allowed to pull the chariots. Covid test of 800 servitors was already conducted earlier.Odisha director general of police Abhay said the shutdown will remain in force from 9pm Monday till 2pm on Wednesday. “To restrict the entry of the people, all entry points to Puri will be sealed and barring urgent matters, no one will be allowed to enter Puri town. The shutdown period will be treated like the imposition of curfew,” said Abhay.“We have mobilised 50 platoons of forces in Puri since Sunday evening,” he added.Rath Yatra, or the chariot journey, celebrates the annual journey of Lord Jagannath and his two siblings from the 12th century Jagannath Temple to their aunt’s abode in Gundicha temple, 2.5km away. The deities are taken in massive wooden chariots weighing 85 tonnes each. After staying in Gundicha temple for nine days, the three deities come back to the Jagannath Temple on the 10th day in a return journey. About a million devotees converge in Puri during the festivities.On June 18, the court ordered a stay on the festival and all activities associated with it, saying there could be large congregations in violation of social distancing norms. The order was passed on a petition filed by NGO Odisha Vikas Parishad, which approached the top court pointing out the public health risk.Union home minister Amit Shah welcomed Monday’s verdict. “Today is a special day for all of us, particularly our Odia sisters and brothers as well as devotees of Mahaprabhu Shri Jagannath Ji. The entire nation is delighted by the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court to ensure the Rath Yatra goes on,” he tweeted.In a statement, Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who is from Odisha, said the event was not just a festival but an “inseparable emotion” for Odias. “Lord Jagannath evokes unwavering love, devotion and reverence,” he said.Advocate Suvidutt MS, who represented Janardhan Pattajoshi Mohapatra, said: “I welcome this judgment that allows the Rath Yatra because it endorses the fact that there should a balance between right of individual believer and the collective rights of society in terms of the spreading pandemic against which the temple committee and state machinery has taken all measures.”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-nod-to-rath-yatra-but-public-not-allowed/story-aF92fbzS5duDSWXuRkWBQK.html
23-06-2020||India||Fear of coronavirus stalks sanitation workers||When the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s solid waste management department of the G-north ward handed over June’s schedule for daily waste collection, one of its waste collectors turned apprehensive.Earlier this month, the 32-year-old was tasked, along with two other municipal workers to collect waste from the containment zones in block 119 – a set of nine areas in Dharavi, one of Asia’s largest slums which saw a severe outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic – and load it into a vehicle that would take the biomedical waste to the city’s only treatment facility located adjacent to the Deonar dumping ground. “The fear of contracting the virus never leaves the mind,” said the sanitation worker, who asked not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “But work is work, and it has to be done.”His job is risky, as very often residents of the containment zone do not segregate the waste they generate into hazardous biomedical waste (yellow bag) and household waste (black bag).“Though residents were provided separate yellow and black coloured bags, we continue to receive one bag every day with all types of mixed waste including masks, gloves, banana peels, gowns and plastic bags that are spilling over,” said the worker. “It is scary when residents toss black bags in large garbage collection bins over the sealed boundary of the containment zone towards us.”Donning a hazmat suit, face mask, rubber gloves and boots, the worker steps into the collection bin, handpicks both Covid-19 related and other waste falling out of the black bags and transfers it into large yellow ones marked Covid-19 waste before passing it on to his co-worker.“We make a chain for quick transfer into the van, and move to the next colony of the containment zone. We take turns at every collection point as to who steps into the bin,” said the sanitation worker.In areas that are not designated as Covid-19 affected, households are not even required to segregate the waste. Yet if, as a press briefing by the Indian Council of Medical Research stated, 69% of the patients testing positive were asymptomatic, then it is likely that a lot of the waste produced from such houses are contaminated by viable virus loads already.BMC officials agreed that workers in the 46 waste segregation centres are at risk, as they separate dry from wet waste. Since April 15, when these centres reopened at the end of the first lockdown, sanitation workers have been dealing with mixed or unsegregated waste containing masks, gloves and other personal protective equipment from households in non-containment zones.What’s more, some of this waste is even making its way to the city’s landfills in Deonar and Kanjurmarg, where at least 10 workers including two security guards reportedly tested positive for Covid-19 and recovered.Anup Nilawar, the spokesperson for SMS Envoclean Private Limited, which runs Mumbai’s CBWTF estimates that at least 600 kg of plastic from personal protective equipment finds its way to the landfills due to non-segregated waste from households and home quarantine centres.The situation isn’t any better in Delhi. At least 15 sanitation workers have died, and 40 have tested positive for the virus till now.“After Covid-19 outbreak, every house, roadside and drain has discarded masks, gloves or face shields. Even if one of these items belongs to a positive person, the sanitation worker who is handling it will also contract the disease. As the number of cases increase, this problem will get bigger and it will be our sanitation workers who will lose their lives,” Sanjay Gahlot, president of Delhi Safai Karamchari Union, said.“They call us corona warriors, but the truth is that they are sending us to this war with no weapons and eventually such a warrior succumbs to the enemy,” said Rakesh Kumar, a contract sanitation worker with the East Delhi Municipal Council for the past five years.Kumar, who ties a thin towel around his mouth and nose, said that he had not received his salary for the past three months from the municipality, either.“We are providing PPE kits, which includes a head cover, glasses, masks, a full body suit, gloves and gumboots to our sanitation workers who collect waste from houses where someone has been tested positive. But those who collect waste from regular houses and sweep the roads and clean drains are only provided with gloves,” an official of East Delhi Municipal Corporation said on the condition of anonymity.The official said that government guidelines make protective kits mandatory for those directly handling the waste generated by positive patients. Even though the other sanitation workers are also at risk, an acute shortage of PPEs forces them to ration them out.The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) has laid out a detailed guideline for handling ‘biomedical waste’, but its definition does not include protective gear from non-positive residents, thus putting thousands of sanitation workers and waste collectors at risk. While the Solid Waste Management Rules (2016) specifies that domestic hazardous waste from households needs to be disposed of in a separate bag and handed over to collectors separately, from where it should be sent to a separate plant for being sanitised and treated, these rules have never been implemented in Delhi.“In such a scenario, domestic hazardous waste such masks and gloves are also discarded as solid waste. Cases are rising in Delhi and a number of people are asymptomatic, so it is important that the safety of waste collectors be kept in mind,” Swati Sambyal, a Delhi-based solid waste management expert, said.She said that while the government needs to come up with a protocol to handle domestic hazardous waste, a simpler solution to this problem could also be to encourage the general public to use reusable, cloth masks, instead of disposable gear.“A regular two-layered, cloth mask can be washed and reused and this will ensure that disposable items do not end up in the waste pile.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fear-of-virus-stalks-sanitation-workers/story-8oyuYRlKgpFEQFDha31PtN.html
23-06-2020||India||India stares at biomedical waste crisis||Mahadev is squatting at a corner of the mountain of waste in north Delhi’s Bhalswa landfill, hunting for plastic in any form. The work of the 45-year-old, who uses only one name, is crucial: the more plastic is recycled, the better it is for the planet as plastic takes anywhere between two decades and five centuries to decompose, choking rivers, and releasing harmful chemicals and heavy metals into water and soil. Mahadev’s work has increased in the past three months and also become more dangerous. He now skims through dozens of discarded masks and plastic gloves with his bare hands to find recyclable plastic ware.The personal protective equipment, the mask, the gloves, the face shield, the shoe cover, and the sanitiser bottle have two things in common: they protect people – and prevent them from transmitting – from the Sars-CoV-2 virus; and they are also made up (mostly) of plastic. In the past three months, a lot of them have ended up in already overflowing landfills, posing a health risk to waste pickers, sanitation workers and garbage collectors tasked with handling them.The coronavirus pandemic has created a new waste crisis.Yet, the only protective gear Mahadev wears is a tattered mask, handed to him a few weeks ago by a group of social workers. “Since April, there is a mound of discarded masks and gloves dumped here. We know it is a risk and we try to take all the necessary precautions, because our safety is only our responsibility. We do not come in any government’s priority list so we have to make do with whatever we have,” says Mahadev, who has been a waste picker for 30 years.While there are no figures available for the amount of plastic that has ended up in landfills during the pandemic, since there is no separate collection of potentially hazardous domestic waste from non-Covid designated houses and institutions (which is what ends up in landfills), local administration officials in both cities admit that there has been an increase in the amount of garbage generated, and that gloves, masks, and personal protection equipment account for at least some bit of the increase. And this is the waste that is collected along with other routine waste -- not biomedical waste from hospitals and other facilities that is collected and treated differently. In Delhi, over 40 sanitation workers have tested positive for the virus, and 15 have lost their lives. In Mumbai, 10 workers and two security guards at the city’s two landfills, in Deonar and Kanjurmarg, have been infected with Covid-19, and recovered. These are just figures from two of the most affected cities in the country today.India is on the brink of a Covid-induced waste crisis, and the authorities are aware of it.Rules of engagementOn April 18, the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), the country’s apex body on the regulation of waste disposal, released a set of guidelines on what to do with Covid-related waste generated by designated sites such as hospitals, laboratories, quarantine centres, containment zones and isolation facilities.Accordingly, used masks, tissues, head covers, shoe covers, disposable linen gowns, non-plastic and semi plastic coveralls were to be disposed of in a yellow bag meant for incineration at a common biomedical waste treatment facility (CBWTF). So were leftover food, disposable plates, glasses, used masks, tissues and toiletries of Covid-19 patients. It was also stipulated that those in home isolation, in containment zones, should deposit biomedical waste generated from suspected or recovered Covid-19 patients in yellow bags to authorised waste collectors, engaged by urban local bodies, or at designated centres or hand over these bags to CBWTF operators.“We share the list of everyone in home isolation in the district with the waste collectors. Plus, there are stickers outside the houses, so they know. The garbage from these houses is collected last and taken in a separate vehicle for proper disposal as biomedical waste,” said a senior district official from Delhi, who asked not to be named. This waste is either taken to a CBWTF or a waste-to-energy plant, where it is then either incinerated, autoclaved (sterilised for shredding and recyling) or burnt to produce energy.However, Swati Singh Sambyal, an independent waste management expert, pointed out that this elaborate exercise gets compromised due to a small but critical issue -- lack of segregation. Municipalities pick up biomedical waste from Covid houses, but it often has other household waste mixed in it. Not only does this put the waste collector at risk, it decreases the efficiency of the incinerators at waste treatment plants as it results in greater emissions and unburnt ash. These facilities, she added, are for anatomical waste, cotton swabs and other items that cannot be autoclaved.“Once the yellow bag reaches the plant, it cannot be opened because it can contaminate, so segregation at the household level is key,” Sambyal said.Residents say that they are not even aware of the need for segregation inside their homes. “It is scary to touch medical waste that is being used regularly for fear that I may contract the disease as well. So we try to put everything in one bag and give it to BMC because they know how best to separate it,” said a 44-year-old woman from Jijamata Nagar, a containment zone in Mumbai’s Worli, whose husband tested positive for Covid-19.“Residents are still not on board about segregating their waste in the basic two categories -- dry and wet -- so the differentiation of a third category becomes difficult. But under the present circumstances, we will require a tailor-made document, taking from the 2016 waste management rules, to address the piles of hazardous waste that is ending up in landfills and dhalaos,” a senior official from the South Delhi Municipal Corporation said on condition of anonymity. But that’s just one part of the problem.The other part is that while the guidelines have accounted for a new kind of waste – after all, PPE are being used everywhere, from hotels to hospitals, railway stations to airports, crematoriums to burial grounds – the disposal mechanisms available in the cities simply aren’t equipped to deal with the volume.Treatment facility crunchThe country has 200 biomedical waste treatment facilities; of these two are in Delhi and one is in Mumbai. And, according to CPCB data, these facilities are already running at 60% capacity – that’s a 15% jump since March. The national average is low, because many cases have not surged in many cities, the way they have in Delhi and Mumbai. In these two cities, the CBWTFs are running at 70-75% and 70% capacities, according to CPCB and the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board respectively.Before the Covid-19 outbreak, a government or a private hospital would typically produce 500 grams of biomedical waste (like syringes, urine bags, gauze etc) per bed, daily. Now, that number has gone up to between 2.5kg to 4kg per bed, daily, according to SMS Water Grace BMW Private Limited, one of the two CBWTFs in Delhi, which collects waste from labs, quarantine centres, and hospitals, including one of the city’s Covid-19 government facilities, the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital. A large Covid-19 facility can anywhere between 1800 to 2200 kg of biomedical waste per day.Now multiply this with the number of Covid-19 hospitals in the country: 2,900. Add to it the biomedical waste generated from 20,700 quarantine centres, 1,540 sample collection centres and 260 laboratories dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic, and the biomedical waste collected by municipalities (Delhi alone has 12,000 home isolation facilities) and one gets a sense of the sheer volume of the problem.Delhi generates 27 tonnes of non-Covid biomedical waste and up to 11 tonnes of Covid-19 related waste every day, according to the CPCB; Mumbai has been generating 9 tonnes of Covid-19 waste and 6 tonnes of non-Covid biomedical waste every day, BMC estimates.Much of this is plastic -- N-95 masks are made up of polyisoprene (natural rubber) and polypropylene (thermoplastic); face shields are all plastic.As it turns out, CPCB guidelines also include red bag waste for contaminated plastic such as goggles, splash proof aprons, plastic coverall, hazmat suits, and nitrile gloves , which are meant to be sterilised, shredded and sent for recycling.Yet, Delhi, in particular, is at a critical stage — the Capital’s total incineration capacity is 37 tonnes per day and it is already utilising approximately 70% to 75% of that. “The amount of waste generated from the hospital has certainly gone up with so many disposable items now,” said Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent of All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi.Biotic Waste Management, the second CBWTF in Delhi collects 7,212 kg of Covid-19 related waste every day from various facilities, besides 10,666.8 kg of general biomedical waste.“We are staring at a big crisis in the coming days if waste is not segregated properly and the load on incineration is not reduced,” said Vikas Gehlot, spokesperson for Biotic.Part of the problem, Gehlot said, is that a lot of organic biomedical waste is making its way to incinerators due to the CPCB guidelines, when it should ideally be going to the waste-to-energy plant in Okhla.“The biomedical waste plants are established based on projections of how much the biomedical waste generation will increase in the next say, 10 years. We didn’t foresee something like Covid-19 coming. It’s a once-in-a-hundred-years crisis,” Gehlot said.The government in Delhi is aware of this problem, but increasing the number of such treatment facilities doesn’t seem to be a viable solution, a senior official told HT.“The capacity of incinerators is a problem, especially when the projection says that we will see a spike in the first week of July and the active cases could go up to as many as 50,000 cases. But that said, it still doesn’t make sense to invest in these machines because we do not know if this infection is episodic or will it be recurring. What do you do with these machines once cases start decreasing?” a senior official from the Delhi health department said, on condition of anonymity.If, and it’s very likely to be so, Covid-19 cases rise further in the coming months – and testing capacities continue to get ramped up – some cities, including Delhi might have to send its Covid-19 waste to neighbouring states for disposal, CPCB scientists warned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-stares-at-biomedical-waste-crisis/story-SpPZrA1tutAAuYhE57p7UI.html
23-06-2020||India||Remdesivir, Favipiravir antiviral drugs ‘no game changers’ in Covid fight, say medical experts||With pharmaceutical companies launching generic versions of Remdesivir and Favipiravir for COVID-19 treatment, medical experts on Monday said it was a “positive development” in the fight against the pandemic, but cautioned against regarding the antiviral drugs as “game changers”.Glenmark Pharmaceuticals has launched the antiviral drug Favipiravir, under the brand name FabiFlu, for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 cases, while Cipla and Hetero have received approvals from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) to launch Remdesivir under the brand names Cipremi and Covifor respectively.Cipla Ltd on Sunday announced the launch of Cipremi.Dr Sanjay Rai, Professor at the Centre for Community Medicine, AIIMS Delhi, said till date no effective treatment or vaccine to combat coronavirus has been found.“Till date we don’t have evidence that a particular drug is effective, so we cannot call any drug game changer till then. With their launch, it will only be clear in the future how effective they will be. Whether they can play a supportive role in COVID-19 treatment is also not yet known,” he told PTI.Dr Vikas Maurya, Director, Department of Pulmonology and Sleep Disorders, Fortis Hospital, Shalimar Bagh, said drugs like Remdesivir and Favipiravir were “no game changers” as they were used for other diseases and have now been found useful in some way in treating COVID-19 patients. “It is not as if all those taking these drugs will recover,” he told PTI. It has been found that they help reduce viral load but are not game changers, Maurya said. “But yes, it is a positive development as it is better to have something in hand than nothing. There is also a psychological impact that something is being given which could have some benefit,” he said. Dr Rommel Tickoo, Associate Director, Internal Medicine, Max Healthcare, also echoed Maurya’s views.Whatever studies that have been done on these drugs are very limited so they cannot be called “game changers”, but their launch is a positive development as it is better to have something than nothing, he said.“On both the drugs we have limited data, whatever evidence we have is mostly anecdotal. There is no specific treatment that we have and we cannot wait for all the trials to be over as many lives will be lost. So that is why emergency restricted use is being approved,” he told PTI.“It is difficult for us to categorically state the efficacy of the drugs, they do have the potential, but we need more data,” he said.Noted city-based lung surgeon Dr Arvind Kumar said he does not believe that any of these antiviral drugs like Remdesivir or Favipiravir will be game changers.“If at all ‘game changer’ can be used, it is for dexamethasone which has shown a significant reduction in mortality and is available cheaply,” said Kumar, who works at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital here.Dr Avi Kumar, Consultant, Pulmonologist, Fortis Escort Heart Institute, said drugs such as Favipiravir and Remdisivir “cannot be called game changers” as they are used as a supportive treatment. “When given early, they can benefit patients but there is no guarantee that the patient will improve or not,” he said.“It is definitely a positive development that we will be using antivirals, but it is not a game changer as that term can be used for something which you give and the patient recovers,” Kumar told PTI.Drug firm Hetero had on Sunday said it has received approval from regulator DCGI to launch investigational antiviral drug Remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. The drug will be available in 100 mg vials (injectable) which has to be administered intravenously in a hospital setting under the supervision of a healthcare practitioner, it said. Asked about the price of the drug, Hetero Group of Companies MD Vamsi Krishna Bandi told PTI it will be in the range of Rs 5,000-6,000 per dose. The drug has been granted approval by DCGI for the treatment of suspected or laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 in adults and children, hospitalised with severe symptoms of the disease, the company said. Cipla has also said that it has been granted regulatory approval by the DCGI for restricted emergency use in the country as part of the accelerated approval process considering the urgent and unmet medical need. Commenting on the launch, Cipla Ltd MD and Global CEO Umang Vohra said, “Cipla appreciates the strong partnership with Gilead to bring Remdesivir to patients in India. We have been deeply invested in exploring all possible avenues to save millions of lives impacted by COVID-19 pandemic, and this launch is a significant milestone in that direction”.In May, domestic pharma firms Hetero, Cipla and Jubilant Life Sciences had entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements with drug major Gilead Sciences Inc for manufacturing and distribution of Remdesivir.Glenmark Pharmaceuticals last week said it has launched antiviral drug Favipiravir, under the brand name FabiFlu, for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 at a price of about Rs 103 per tablet.FabiFlu is the first oral Favipiravir-approved medication in India for the treatment of COVID-19, it said in a statement.

23-06-2020||India||Army top brass reviews LAC situation amid tensions with China||The army’s top brass on Monday made a detailed assessment of the ground situation along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, where Indian and Chinese forces have significantly beefed up their deployments in the extended region on both sides of the contested border, two senior officers said on the condition of anonymity.The developments along the LAC and the army’s operational readiness to handle any situation were discussed in detail at the army commanders’ conference, chaired by army Chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane, the first officer said.The situation along the Line of Control (LoC) with Pakistan also came up during the discussions, amid concerns that the western neighbour could try to take advantage of the tensions along the northern borders with China, the second officer said.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane will visit Leh on Tuesday for a security review of the Ladakh sector, amid rising tensions between India and China along the LAC. Senior officers will brief him on the latest developments along the disputed border. This will be his second visit to the Ladakh sector after the border standoff began in early May. He had earlier visited Leh on May 22.While the conference was pre-scheduled, it is being held at a time when the Indian and Chinese armies have marshalled thousands of soldiers on their respective sides of the LAC and the military build up consists of fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns and missile systems, he said.The conference will conclude on Tuesday. It was the second phase of the conference --- the first was held in Delhi on May 27-29.The top commanders met a day after defence minister Rajnath Singh made a detailed assessment of the situation at the disputed border and was briefed by the military brass about the preparations of the armed forces and their readiness to respond to any provocative actions by the Chinese forces.Singh left for Russia on Monday where he will meet his Russian counterpart Sergei Shoigu and the spike in border tensions with China will figure in the talks. Singh will be participating in the Victory Day parade in Moscow on June 24.Tensions between India and China have surged after the Galwan Valley brawl on June 15 that resulted in 20 Indian deaths, including that of a commanding officer, and the Chinese army possibly suffered more than twice as many casualties, which also included a commanding officer, said another officer.With uncertainty looming along the LAC, the government has given financial powers worth Rs 500 crore per project to the armed forces to fast-track the purchase of critical weapons and ammunition to deal with any kind of scenario. Similar financial powers were bestowed on the military after the 2016 Uri terror attack and the 2019 Balakot air strikes to plug gaps in capabilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-top-brass-reviews-lac-situation-amid-tensions-with-china/story-xORF7D8d0RKRpdAnQ9jnJN.html
