Nor is the Gap. But come Monday, Mackenzi Farquer will absolutely be selling her merchandise—in person, at her boutiques in Queens and Brooklyn—for the first time in more than two months.It won’t be the same, of course. Only curbside pickup is allowed in this first phase of New York’s Covid-19 reopening, but Farquer is prepared. Her five stores, called Lockwood, are for people who enjoy browsing, selling items like coffee mugs that say “Social Distancing Club,” Star Trek jigsaw puzzles and vanilla-scented erasers.So she had her visual merchandiser set up a curbside display that will allow shoppers to simulate Lockwood’s serendipitous shopping experience just a bit, with alcohol hand sprays and masks mixed in.“I’m hoping that when people come to do curbside, it feels for a brief moment like shopping,” said Farquer, 41.For New York’s small businesses, which depend almost entirely on city residents, Monday marks a vital moment to start bringing in the customers and revenue they lost during the shutdown — an undertaking all the more precarious with the current social unrest. Farquer’s Lockwood survived by selling merchandise through her website and getting four of her five landlords to cut rent by as much as 40% for the summer. Nearly 90% of small businesses have seen a large or moderate negative effect from the pandemic, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.“I think psychologically it will get people to shop a little more because it’s official.”Yet even as small shops scramble to get back to business and earn some money for the families that own them, major retail chains aren’t rushing to restart. Macy’s will not yet reopen its Herald Square flagship, one of the world’s largest department stores. Tiffany & Co. will wait at least another few days before considering serving shoppers at its Fifth Avenue shop. Coach, Kate Spade and Stuart Weitzman fashion boutiques will stay closed, as will New Balance shoe stores and Zales jewelry locations. Ulta Beauty hasn’t yet set a timeline for its return to the city. One that does plan to open is the Container Store, which will offer pickup for online and phone orders.We’re tracking everything you need to know as New York reopens after the Covid-19 shutdown. Read our explainer and sign up for alerts sent directly to your inbox.These big chains have hundreds of stores across the U.S. that have reopened in recent weeks and robust e-commerce operations fueled by vast international supply chains and distribution channels, so business elsewhere can prop up their stores in New York. Local shops didn’t have any of those benefits.“Small businesses are typically managed by their founders and owners,” said Mark Cohen, director of retail studies at the Columbia Business School. “A small business owner has a rent bill due, merchandise they’ve taken in that they haven’t paid for and employees they feel honor-bound to re-employ. So there’s probably a different motive component to small businesses reopening.”That’s certainly the case with Christine Alcalay, a fashion designer who owns two boutiques in Brooklyn called Kiwi and Fig. She’s kept her stores afloat by revamping the company’s e-commerce to make it easier to shop, but sales are still down about 80% from a year ago. She furloughed all but one of her 10 employees when the pandemic hit.That left her delivering online orders, answering customer e-mails and texts, while securing a loan from the Small Business Administration, which allowed her to start paying her staff again. She also made Instagram videos, in which she not only modeled clothes, but also talked about her struggles as a business owner. Now she’s hoping that the first phase of reopening New York’s retail industry would at least get residents comfortable with shopping again.“I think psychologically it will get people to shop a little more because it’s official,” said Alcalay, who has been in business for 18 years. Alcalay initially planned to make a marketing push for the reopening, but scaled it back because of the protests over police brutality. “It doesn’t feel like the right time to be pushing merchandise with what’s going on right now,” she said. Still, she planned to fix up the front of the stores for when people pick up orders. And she already had a local artist paint pickup hours and website addresses on the windows.“I think we are going to make it through this,” Alcalay said. “But I’m worried about the next year or two.”Lockwood’s Farquer  is locked in on the calendar, too—New York Governor Andrew Cuomo’s next phase of reopening, when she’ll be able to open her doors to the public again.‘At some point you have to keep the business going,” she said. If limited retail is allowed by July, ‘for a lot of us it’s going to come just in the nick of time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-s-shops-cautiously-reopen-after-months-of-lockdown/story-OqNEiyUYVYweIjoZRMJSbI.html
08-06-2020||World||‘No need to be shy’: China asks US senator for proof of vaccine sabotage||China on Monday challenged a US senator to furnish evidence supporting his allegation that Beijing is actively trying to sabotage the efforts of western countries to develop a vaccine for Covid-19.Republican Senator Rick Scott has told BBC television that he thinks China is actively working to disrupt the efforts of the US and other western countries to develop the vaccine.“We have evidence that communist China is trying to sabotage us or slow it down. China does not want us and England and Europe to do it first. They have decided to be an adversary to Americans and I think to democracy around the world,” Scott said.Scott said the information was provided by the US’s intelligence community but didn’t elaborate.On Monday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Hua Chunying’s response to Scott’s accusation was acerbic.“Since this lawmaker said he has evidence that China is trying to sabotage western countries in their vaccine development, then please let him present the evidence. There’s no need to be shy,” Hua told journalists at the regular ministry briefing on Monday.Hua added that the development of a Covid-19 vaccine is not a bilateral competition and Beijing hopes Washington will mirror China’s pledge and offer any vaccine it develops to the world for free.On Sunday, a senior Chinese official said once developed, China will make its Covid-19 vaccine a global public good.Wang Zhigang, minister of science and technology, said at a press conference in Beijing that international cooperation should be strengthened in vaccine development, clinical trials and application.Vaccine development should focus on “…ensuring safety, effectiveness, and accessibility”.China is currently developing COVID-19 vaccines in five categories -- inactivated vaccines, recombinant protein vaccines, live attenuated influenza vaccines, adenovirus vaccines, and nucleic acid-based vaccines, Wang said.At the same Sunday press conference, vice foreign minister Ma Zhaoxu said China has participated in an international collaboration initiative launched by the WHO to accelerate the development of vaccines and medicines for Covid-19.The clash of words on developing the vaccine is the latest chapter in the ongoing row between China and the US on the pandemic.US President Donald Trump has led Washington’s criticism of China’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak, accusing Beijing of cover-up and lack of transparency.Countering the accusations, China has repeatedly said it has been open and transparent about the outbreak, which first emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan in late 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-need-to-be-shy-china-asks-us-senator-for-proof-of-vaccine-sabotage/story-FoLdUUDZdgRKnoJCsNKeEO.html
08-06-2020||World||Black Lives Matter protests: Gandhi statue targeted in London||Protestors taped placards with anti-racism messages across Mahatma Gandhi’s statue in Parliament Square and wrote ‘racist’ near its plinth, as UK became one of the major sites of George Floyd demonstrations outside the United States on Sunday.The statue, installed in 2015, is one among 12 in the square of prominent British, Commonwealth and foreign political figures, such as Abraham Lincoln and Nelson Mandela. Winston Churchill’s statue was also targeted, with the words sprayed on it: ‘was a racist’.The Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement provided spark in the south-west England town of Bristol, where there has long been public unease with its historical links with slave trade. Edward Colston, a 17th century local slave trader who profited considerably from the trade, has a visible presence through his philanthropic activities in the town, including a statue.ALSO WATCH | Mahatma Gandhi statue vandalised in Washington DC, US apologises Also read| Black Lives Matter protests: Winston Churchill statue vandalised in LondonThe statue, installed in 1895, was pulled down with ropes by throngs of anti-racism protestors, dragged along the town’s streets, and thrown into river Avon.Pulling down Colston’s statue was hailed by Labour MPs and others, while several policemen were injured in demonstrations in London. The action in Bristol came in for criticism from home secretary Priti Patel, who called it “utterly disgraceful”.Sajid Javid, former chancellor, said: “I grew up in Bristol. I detest how Edward Colston profited from the slave trade. But, THIS IS NOT OK. If Bristolians wants to remove a monument it should be done democratically - not by criminal damage”.Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: “People have a right to protest peacefully & while observing social distancing but they have no right to attack the police. These demonstrations have been subverted by thuggery – and they are a betrayal of the cause they purport to serve”.“Those responsible will be held to account”, he added.The police in Bristol defended not preventing the Colston statue being pulled down and thrown into the river, but added that it was an “act of criminal damage” for which an investigation will be carried out to identify those involved.A large number of people demonstrated through Sunday outside the US embassy in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-protests-gandhi-statue-targeted-in-london/story-PhDYQb8WxzhAwJySGpRhsM.html
08-06-2020||World||United States’ current supply of Remdesivir to get exhausted by end of June||The US government’s current supply of Remdesivir, the only drug till now known to be working against coronavirus, will exhaust by the end of June.“Right now, we’re waiting to hear from Gilead Sciences, the manufacturer of the drug, what is their expected delivery availability of the drug as we go from June to July. We’re kind of not in negotiations, but in discussions with Gilead as they project what the availability of their product will be,” Dr. Robert Kadlec, a US Department of Health and Human Services official, told CNN.Kadlec further said that the Gilead has given a “general range” of product delivery for July and August, which then “significantly expands beginning in September, October, and through the fall as they kind of open the spigot of their production and processing.”However, “whatever the supply may be, there may not be enough for everyone who may need it,” he added.In May, the US Food and Drug Administration had given an emergency authorization for Remdesivir.When the coronavirus” pandemic first struck the world, the World Health Organisation (WHO) also identified Remdesivir as one of the potential treatments for the disease.The drug also managed to shorten hospital visits by four days and reduced mortality rate from 11.6 per cent to 8 per cent.However, Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) said these results were modest and there was no significant reduction in deaths.

08-06-2020||World||Covid-19: New Zealand lifts all domestic restrictions, PM declares virus victory||New Zealand lifted all domestic coronavirus restrictions on Monday after its final Covid-19 patient was given the all clear, with Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern revealing she danced around her living room when told about the milestone.While strict border controls will remain in place, Ardern said restrictions such as social distancing and limits on public gatherings were no longer needed.“We are confident we have eliminated transmission of the virus in New Zealand for now,” she said in a televised address, saying Kiwis had “united in unprecedented ways to crush the virus”.The South Pacific nation, with a population of five million, has had 1,154 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 22 deaths.There have been no new infections for 17 days and, until Monday, just one active case for more than a week.Details of the final patient were not released for privacy reasons but it is believed to be a woman aged in her 50s who was linked to a cluster at an Auckland nursing home.Ardern said the sacrifices made by New Zealanders, including a drastic seven-week lockdown that helped curb infection rates, had been rewarded now that there were no active cases in the country.Asked about her reaction upon hearing the news, she replied: “I did a little dance” with baby daughter Neve.“She was caught a little by surprise but she joined in, having absolutely no idea why I was dancing around the lounge.”New Zealand’s move down to Level 1, the lowest rating on its four-tier virus response system, means nightclubs can operate without dance floor restrictions and theatres will reopen.It also means sporting events can proceed with crowds in the stands, a change New Zealand Rugby (NZR) said offered its Super Rugby Aotearoa competition the opportunity to achieve a world first when it kicks off this weekend.“We’re incredibly proud, and grateful, to be the first professional sports competition in the world to be in a position to have our teams play in front of their fans again,” NZR chief executive Mark Robinson said.While many other sporting competitions around the globe have announced plans to restart, the vast majority will be played either with no crowds or with numbers severely restricted.On a broader level, Ardern said easing restrictions would help New Zealand’s economy.“We now have a head start on economic recovery because at level one we become one of the most open, if not the most open, economies in the world,” she said.The Prime Minister said modelling showed the economy would operate at just 3.8 percent below normal at Level 1, compared with a 37 percent impairment at Level 4 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-zealand-lifts-all-domestic-restrictions-pm-declares-virus-victory/story-f7wyIX7IfTAXt7ne0o2v6J.html
08-06-2020||World||Can’t you just fire me? Man paid to do nothing wanted $2 mn||An executive who was paid about $18,000 a month by LafargeHolcim Ltd. to do nothing failed in his suit to force the cement maker to fire him with a payout worth more than $2 million. Timing was his undoing.When his employer Lafarge SA announced in 2015 a staff-buyout program as part of its merger with Holcim Ltd., Antoine Zenone hoped he could get a golden handshake. But the company told him he wasn’t eligible and French judges have said “non” -- three times in a row.The Paris appeals court ruled that Zenone couldn’t benefit from the plan because he’d already agreed to an expatriate position in Singapore. That suspended his French employment contract and excluded him from buyout offers made to Lafarge’s domestic staff.Zenone was seeking about 2.1 million euros ($2.3 million) and until recently had been paid 16,195 euros gross a month by Lafarge without having to provide any work, according to last week’s ruling.The world’s two largest cement makers combined in 2015 to cut costs and boost value as demand for building materials eroded. But LafargeHolcim shares slid in subsequent years on a loss of investor confidence and a scandal over operations in war-torn Syria.Chief ExecutiveWhen Zenone came back from his posting as chief executive officer of Lafarge’s branch in Singapore two years ago, Lafarge offered him a project manager position but he didn’t take the role. He states on his LinkedIn profile that he started a new job at a plastic pipe maker last month.LafargeHolcim said in a statement it doesn’t comment on personnel matters. Zenone didn’t respond to requests for comment on the lawsuit.As part of the tie-up, Lafarge told staff representatives in May 2015 that about 380 jobs would be cut throughout the world, in part through a voluntary program.Just two days earlier, he had written an email cited in the court case that he agreed to take the Singapore position. “I look forward to starting,” he said.French ContractHad he replied two days later, Zenone might have been considered for a buyout.Zenone later complained that he was misled into taking the Singapore expat job and asked to get back on a French contract.He told Lafarge in mid-2016 that he had only agreed to the posting because he believed it meant eventually becoming country CEO for both cement makers’ operations in the southeast Asian state.That argument, which didn’t move LafargeHolcim, also failed to convince the Paris appeals court.“He can’t claim that his job was made impossible given that he continued to occupy his post for almost three years,” the judges ruled. The court added that there was no evidence that Lafarge was responsible for the failure to complete the merger of the two companies’ operations in Singapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/can-t-you-just-fire-me-man-paid-to-do-nothing-wanted-2-million/story-mqPkEwO2svjFrYLb6rB5JN.html
08-06-2020||World||Tropical Storm Cristobal makes landfall along southeast Louisiana||Tropical Storm Cristobal on early Sunday evening (local time) made landfall in southeast Louisiana between the mouth of the Mississippi River and Grand Isle, CNN reported citing data from the National Hurricane Center.With maximum sustained winds near 50 mph, Cristobal is expected to move north at about 7 mph, the Center said. It should become a tropical depression within 24 hours and will continue to dump heavy rain that could lead to flash flooding, mainly across the Mississippi River Valley in Louisiana, Mississippi and Arkansas.Life-threatening storm surges could occur in parts of Mississippi and Louisiana. Storm surges occur when rising water moves inland from the coast, potentially causing injury and damage to property.“Just because this is a tropical storm doesn’t mean that we want to let our guard down,” CNN meteorologist Derek Van Dam said.“A storm surge is a major threat, and it’s the number one killer in tropical storms like this,” Dam added.New Orleans issued a voluntary evacuation order on Sunday afternoon as well for areas outside the levee system.As per the Hurricane Center, the impacts from the third named storm of a busy Atlantic hurricane season will be felt hundreds of miles away. Neighbouring states to the east such as Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, even the Carolinas will pick up several inches of rain in a short period of time which could trigger flash flooding.Widespread rainfall along the coast will likely be in the 5-10 inch range, with some areas picking up at least a foot total. This will exacerbate the flooding concern for states like Louisiana, Arkansas, and Florida, which have already received at least 8-10 inches in just the last 30 days, the Center said.Another concern for a severe weather condition is tornadoes and water spouts -- funnel-shaped clouds over water -- which have already been reported in the southeast.“We’re seeing not just the significant storm surge, but tornadoes,” CNN Meteorologist Tom Sater said.“Numerous water spouts have been making their way over toward land,” he added.In Florida Saturday there were seven tornado reports, including one that hit near downtown Orlando. At least three homes were significantly impacted by storm activity, according to a city spokesperson.According to some media reports, coronavirus testing events that had been scheduled for Monday in Jackson have been cancelled owning to the approaching storm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-cristobal-makes-landfall-along-southeast-louisiana/story-PBllAEhp0yL0bzAoQzJLgJ.html
08-06-2020||World||Black Lives Matter protests: Winston Churchill statue vandalised in London||Anti-racism protesters in England defaced the memorial to Winston Churchill in Westminster during Black Lives Matter protests on Sunday, local media reported.According to the The Evening Standard, demonstrators scrawled “was a racist” on the statue of the wartime British Prime Minister in Parliament Square on Sunday afternoon as thousands descended on London for another protest over an American black man George Floyd’s death.Activists surrounded the monument and jeered “Churchill was a racist”, despite others intervening to protect it from further defacement.The same statue was also defaced with green graffiti during a huge anti-racism rally on Saturday, the 76th anniversary of D-Day.It prompted Piers Morgan of ITV Breakfast programme Good Morning Britain, to tweet: “Memo to protesters in Westminster today: defacing Sir Winston Churchill’s statue on the 76th anniversary of D-Day is not a good way to make your point.”Thousands flooded the streets outside London’s US Embassy yesterday for another Black Lives Matter rally, alongside rallies in Manchester, Edinburgh and Bristol among the other UK cities.In Bristol, in southwest England, a statue honouring the 17th century slave trader Edward Colston was torn down by protesters.Demonstrators were later seen rolling the statue to the nearby harbor and throwing it into the River Avon.The local police told CNN that an investigation has been launched into the incident.“There was a small group of people who clearly committed an act of criminal damage in pulling down a statue near Bristol Harbourside,” Avon and Somerset police said Sunday in a statement.“An investigation will be carried out to identify those involved and we are already collating footage of the incident,” the statement read.The statue of Colston had stood in Bristol’s city center since 1895 but had become increasingly controversial, with petitions created to demand its removal.According to local police, Sunday’s Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol was attended by an estimated 10,000 people.“The vast majority of those who came to voice their concerns about racial inequality and injustice did so peacefully and respectfully,” the police were quoted as saying.“Keeping the public safe was out greatest priority and thankfully there were no instances of disorder and no arrests were made,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-protests-winston-churchill-statue-vandalised-in-london/story-JgO1w5fAmeav3pyEYKj79M.html
08-06-2020||World||Zero active cases: How New Zealand eliminated Covid-19||At a time when the world is grappling with the fast-spreading Covid-19, New Zealand has announced that it has eradicated the novel coronavirus which causes the disease.The stunning announcement came on Monday when the country’s health officials said that it has no active cases of Covid-19. The Pacific island nation is among only a handful of countries that have emerged from the pandemic, which first gripped the United States and has now turned Latin American into a hotspot.It has been 17 days since the last new case was reported in New Zealand, and Monday also marked the first time since late February that there have been no active cases.So how did they do it?New Zealand enforced a strict lockdown for nearly seven weeks, in which most businesses were shut and everyone except essential workers had to stay at home.Experts say that its isolated location in the South Pacific also gave New Zealand vital time to see how outbreaks spread in other countries. Just over 1,500 people contracted the virus in New Zealand, including 22 who died.New Zealand’s Health Ministry said in a statement on Monday that the last person who was being monitored for coronavirus had recovered.The officials, however, caution that new cases could be imported into the country, which has closed its borders to everybody but citizens and residents, with some exceptions.How was lockdown implemented in New Zealand?The country of five million people has pursued an elimination strategy to beat coronavirus, rather than just aiming to contain the disease.Elimination did not mean eradicating the virus permanently from New Zealand, but eliminating “chains of transmission” for at least 28 consecutive days after the last infected person left isolation, which would be on June 15, the ministry said.And this was done by the strict lockdown put in palce by the Jacinda Ardern government.What now?New Zealand has decided to move to national Alert Level 1 from the current Level 2. New Zealand’s Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said on Monday that all coronavirus measures in the country will be lifted from Tuesday, barring border closure restrictions.She said public and private events can go on without restrictions, retail and hospitality sectors can operate normally, and all public transport can resume.“Having no active cases for the first time since February 28 is certainly a significant mark in our journey but as we’ve previously said, ongoing vigilance against Covid-19 will continue to be essential,” Director-General of Health Dr Ashley Bloomfield said in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zero-active-cases-how-new-zealand-eliminated-covid-19/story-vTybkQoMZOp824nRAuYI7N.html

[Using civilian transportation] substantially expanded our means of transporting forces and increased efficiency in maneuvering an entire organisation of troops,” Major Colonel Mao Lei, head of the training department at the airborne brigade, said on CCTV.“Groups of tanks and armored vehicles attached to the 76th Group Army under the PLA Western Theater Command also conducted a long-distance maneuver on May 14,” according to Chinese military media outlet China Military, quoted by GT.Last week, another report in the Global Times had said that the PLA’s Tibet Military Command recently “...sent troops to a high-altitude region at an elevation of 4,700 meters at night for infiltration exercises behind enemy lines and tested their combat capability under a harsh environment”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-army-carries-out-large-scale-drill-to-check-preparedness-at-border-with-india/story-fTUML5T6h9e3uMRRp2Vr7L.html
08-06-2020||World||New Zealand eliminates Covid-19 with zero active cases reported||New Zealand reported zero active cases of Covid-19 for the first time since the pandemic reached its shores, indicating it has achieved its aim of eliminating the virus.The South Pacific nation said Monday that the last of its coronavirus patients has recovered. That makes it one of the few countries in the world to have successfully eradicated the pathogen, and the first among those that suffered a sizable outbreak. Only a handful of nations can make the claim, mostly small islands that had very few infections to begin with.The development comes just hours before Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is expected to announce a lifting of all remaining restrictions on people and businesses -- other than strict border controls to keep the virus out -- paving the way for a resumption of normal life.New Zealand pursued an explicit elimination strategy rather than seeking to merely suppress transmission of the virus. It enforced one of the strictest lockdowns in the world, asking everyone to stay at home and allowing only essential services to operate. While this has almost certainly triggered a deep recession, the government says elimination of the virus should allow the economy to recover more rapidly than many of its peers.It is taking a cautious approach to the elimination milestone, however. The Ministry of Health’s definition of elimination is 28 days of no new cases after the last person to have contracted the virus via community transmission left quarantine, which would be achieved on June 15.The seven-week lockdown ended May 14 and cabinet will decide today whether to lower the nation’s alert level to 1, which would remove the last remaining restrictions, including the requirement for social distancing. Ardern is scheduled to hold a press conference at 3 p.m. in Wellington.MasterclassArdern’s masterclass in crisis management has won her praise at home and abroad. Support for the prime minister and her Labour Party surged in recent opinion polls, forcing the main opposition party to replace its leader less than four months out from a general election.But it is not a foregone conclusion that Ardern will sweep to victory at the Sept. 19 vote, with unemployment expected to soar in coming months.The closed border is taking a heavy toll on the tourism sector, which was the nation’s biggest source of foreign exchange earnings before the pandemic, and there is little prospect of it fully recovering until a vaccine is found.There has also been criticism that New Zealand’s response to the virus was too extreme, as neighboring Australia appears to have achieved similar results with less stringent measures. During its lockdown it allowed more industries to continue operating, such as construction, and consumers were still able to get a haircut or buy a takeaway meal, keeping many workers on lower incomes employed.However, there are early signs that New Zealand’s status as a virus-free haven will work to its advantage. It is in talks with Australia to open a so-called travel bubble, and the Education Minister has said the country may become an even more desirable destination for foreign students, even if they need to serve a two-week quarantine on arrival.The theory behind New Zealand’s elimination strategy is that Covid-19 has a longer incubation period than influenza -- an average of five to six days and as long as two weeks, compared with just two to three days for the flu.That means authorities have time to identify and isolate those who have been in contact with an infected person before they themselves become infectious.New Zealand recorded a total of 1,504 confirmed and probable cases of Covid-19 and 22 deaths. It hasn’t had a new case for 17 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-eliminates-covid-19-with-zero-active-cases-reported/story-ygfqpU0g6h2YHTHlryl20I.html

When compared with a previous survey conducted between March 29 and April 3, StatCan found more than a third of the respondents, or 35 per cent, reporting “that they were eating more junk food or sweets” as against 27 per cent earlier.Those figures as consistent for other unhealthy habits as well, like consuming alcohol or tobacco products. “Close to one in five Canadians (19%) said that their consumption of alcohol had increased, compared with about 14% a month earlier,” StatCan noted. The number consuming more tobacco products grew from 3 per cent to 5 per cent.While StatCan did not comment on a possible correlation, it found that almost one in five Canadians reported feelings of moderate to severe anxiety, even as they “are stricken by grief, financial hardship and labour market difficulties. Canadians are also spending extended periods at home, which can be stressful for individuals of all ages.”However, the survey also found that Canadians were largely being careful when it came to coronavirus-related precautions. There were increases in the number of respondents saying they were practising social distancing, washing their hands more regularly and avoiding crowds or large gatherings, with more than 90 percentage for each category.Tam said she “was pleased to see that 92% of participants confirmed they have been practising physical distancing, and 95% have reported washing their hands more regularly.” Canada has so far recorded 7800 deaths due to the coronavirus with 95684 infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-junk-food-consumption-alcohol-and-tobacco-intake-rises-amid-covid-19-survey/story-VUrWBSh4fO2LerXKLHKgXI.html
08-06-2020||World||Officials urge Floyd protesters to get coronavirus tests||With New York City poised to reopen after a more than two-month coronavirus shutdown, officials on Sunday lifted a curfew that was in place amid protests of police brutality and racial injustice. But they also urged that demonstrators be tested for Covid-19.“Get a test. Get a test,” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo told people who have been participating in rallies and marches in memory of George Floyd.He said the state would open 15 testing sites dedicated to protesters so they can get results quickly.“I would act as if you were exposed, and I would tell people you are interacting with, assume I am positive for the virus,” Cuomo added.The call is similar to those made in Seattle, San Francisco and Atlanta following massive demonstrations, with free testing for protesters.New York has been the epicenter of the US outbreak, with black communities hit especially hard.The Rev. Brandon Watts of Epiphany Church in Brooklyn, was mindful of the pandemic while organizing a “Pray & Protest” march with several other churches. He mandated that protesters wear masks, and he came with boxes of them. He also asked the group to try to maintain social distancing but acknowledged “it’s kind of hard in a protest.”Attendees also were offered free coronavirus tests at one church.“US-19 hit the inner city harder than anybody else,” Watts said. “And so we have to be very careful. We’re the only ones in a pandemic within a pandemic.”Brooklyn resident Celeste Douglas attended her third protest in the past week and said she’ll continue until legislation is passed on budgets for police and education.“I want to tell my children when they ask when this stuff started to change, I want to tell them I was a part of it,” Douglas said, acknowledging being nervous in a crowd during a pandemic but also planning to be tested.New York City prepared to enter its first phase of reopening after virus shutdowns. Up to 400,000 people are expected to head back to the workplace Monday, with many using a subway system that most New Yorkers have avoided since March to keep away from crowds.Mayor Bill de Blasio lifted the city’s 8 p.m. curfew imposed for the Floyd protests. The police pulled back on enforcing the curfew Saturday as thousands turned out.“Last night was the best by far,” de Blasio said. “We had the biggest number of protesters, the fewest arrests, the fewest problems and that convinced me it was time for the curfew to go away. I have no intention of bringing it back.”Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot also lifted the city’s curfew, reopened downtown train stations and allowed full bus service to resume following days of largely calm protests.Cities imposed curfews amid last week’s spasms of arson, assaults and smash-and-grab raids on businesses. Recent US protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful, as were rallies held around the globe.Floyd’s body arrived in Texas for a third and final memorial service, said Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo. A viewing is planned for Monday in Houston, followed by a service and burial Tuesday in suburban Pearland.The 46-year-old out-of-work bouncer died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after he stopped responding. His death has drawn new attention to the treatment of African Americans by police and the criminal justice system.In Washington, D.C., National Guard troops from South Carolina were seen checking out of their hotel Sunday shortly before President Donald Trump tweeted he was giving the order to withdraw them from the nation’s capital.The D.C. mayor had called on Trump last week to withdraw outside forces amid days of largely peaceful rallies after he ordered guard troops to “dominate” the streets.At the newly renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, protesters posed with the street sign and the yellow block lettering painted on the pavement by the city. As ice cream truck jingles mixed with protest chats, the district’s Metropolitan Police Department patrolled in place of federal law enforcement officers and National Guard troops.At Atlanta Motor Speedway, NASCAR paused before Sunday’s Cup race to acknowledge the nationwide protests, in a remarkable moment for the sport with its roots in the South and one-time embrace of Confederate symbols.During warm-up laps, the 40 cars pulled to a stop in front of the empty grandstands and shut off their engines so NASCAR President Steve Phelps could deliver a message over their radio sets.“Our country is in pain and people are justifiably angry, demanding to be heard. The black community and all people of color have suffered in our country, and it has taken far too long for us to hear their demands for change,” Phelps said. “Our sport must do better. Our country must do better.”Protesters in Bristol, England , tore down a statue of Edward Colston, a 17th century slave trader, and pushed it into the harbor of the port city in southwestern England.On Saturday, a small group of demonstrators toppled a statue of a Confederate general in Richmond, Virginia, the former capital of the Confederacy. Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam has pledged to remove a statue of Gen. Robert E. Lee after days of Floyd protests.In other protests outside the US:A crowd estimated at 10,000, many in face masks, filled a square in front of the main courthouse in Brussels, holding white roses and signs decrying racism. “You think you are tired of hearing about racism? We are tired of experiencing it,” read one placard held up by a young black woman.In Milan, Italy, a few thousand people rallied against racism outside the central train station, many of them African migrants or the children of migrants who want to see reforms making it easier to receive citizenship. One held a sign saying, “I Fight For My Kids.”Thousands massed outside the gleaming new US Embassy in London, where student Darcy Bourne said the demonstration was about “more than just George Floyd, more than just America, but racism all around the world.”Thousands wearing masks against the virus gathered peacefully in Spain’s main cities, including at the US Embassy in Madrid, to denounce racism and chant: “Police murderers!” and “No justice, no peace!” A protest also was held in central Barcelona.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/officials-urge-floyd-protesters-to-get-coronavirus-tests/story-EXCYXt6yHSKBDlkxIyLG4N.html

Attendees also were offered free coronavirus tests at one church.“Covid-19 hit the inner city harder than anybody else,” Watts said. “And so we have to be very careful. We’re the only ones in a pandemic within a pandemic.”In addition to suffering disproportionately from the the virus, the black community also has been roiled by the death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white officer pressed a knee into his neck while arresting him.Floyd’s death sparked massive protests throughout the country and renewed calls to reform policing in America. A majority of the City Council in Minneapolis, where Floyd died, said Sunday they support disbanding the police department. A heavy-handed police response to protesters in many places has underscored what critics have maintained: Law enforcement is militarized and too often uses excessive force.Cities imposed curfews as several protests last week were marred by spasms of arson, assaults and smash-and-grab raids on businesses. More than 10,000 people have been arrested around the country since protests began, sometimes after violent confrontations with officers. Videos have surfaced of officers in riot gear using tear gas or physical force against even peaceful demonstrators.But recent US protests have been overwhelmingly peaceful — and over the weekend, several police departments appeared to retreat from aggressive tactics.Several cities have also lifted their curfews, including Chicago and New York City, which is preparing to enter its first phase of reopening after virus shutdowns. Up to 400,000 people are expected to head back to the workplace Monday.“Last night was the best by far,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said. “We had the biggest number of protesters, the fewest arrests, the fewest problems and that convinced me it was time for the curfew to go away.”In Compton, California, several thousand protesters, some on horseback, peacefully demonstrated Sunday through the city, just south of Los Angeles. The only law enforcement presence was about a dozen sheriff’s deputies, who watched without engaging.A similar scene played out on Saturday when thousands of protesters converged on San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge. Tow trucks held off car traffic, and police directed vehicles caught in the middle to go around protesters.For the first time since protests popped up in New York more than a week ago, most NYPD officers were not wearing riot helmets as they watched over marches and rallies. Police moved the barricades at the Trump hotel at Columbus Circle in Manhattan for protesters and replaced when they passed through the area.Mayor de Blasio said police had arrested just four people and issued 24 court summonses on Saturday — in stark contrast to more than 2,000 arrests made through Friday morning.Even at Brooklyn’s Barclays Center, which has been the site of numerous faceoffs between protesters and police, officers stood by casually as hundreds of protesters gathered to observe a moment of silence for George Floyd. Some officers even shook hands and posed for photos with motorcyclists at the rally.In Washington, D.C., National Guard troops from South Carolina were seen checking out of their hotel Sunday shortly before President Donald Trump tweeted he was giving the order to withdraw them from the nation’s capital.At the newly renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza near the White House, protesters posed with the street sign and the yellow block lettering painted on the pavement by the city. As ice cream truck jingles mixed with protest chats, the district’s Metropolitan Police Department patrolled.Meanwhile, a majority of city council members in Minneapolis vowed to radically overhaul policing. Council Member Jeremiah Ellison went so far as to promise the council would “dismantle” the agency.The state of Minnesota launched a civil rights investigation of the department last week, and the first concrete changes came Friday when the city agreed to ban chokeholds and neck restraints.“It is clear that our system of policing is not keeping our communities safe,” said Lisa Bender, the council president. “Our efforts at incremental reform have failed, period.”￼Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey told protesters outside his house that he doesn’t support the “full abolition” of the police department. Protesters shouted back: “Shame! Shame!”Floyd’s body arrived in Texas for a third and final memorial service, said Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo. A viewing is planned for Monday in Houston, followed by a service and burial Tuesday in suburban Pearland.The 46-year-old out-of-work bouncer’s death at the hands of police has drawn new attention to the treatment of African Americans by law enforcement — in the United States and around the world.At Atlanta Motor Speedway, NASCAR paused before Sunday’s Cup race to acknowledge the nationwide protests, in a remarkable moment for the sport with its roots in the South and one-time embrace of Confederate symbols.During warm-up laps, the 40 cars pulled to a stop in front of the empty grandstands, and NASCAR President Steve Phelps spoke.“The black community and all people of color have suffered in our country, and it has taken far too long for us to hear their demands for change,” Phelps said. “Our sport must do better.

08-06-2020||World||Robot dog hounds Thai shoppers to keep hands coronavirus-free||A scurrying robot dog named K9 dispenses hand sanitizer to curious children and wary shoppers -- one of the more unexpected measures Thai malls are taking as the kingdom relaxes virus restrictions.The hi-tech hound is controlled using 5G, a technology promising super-fast internet speeds with immediate reaction times that is still in the initial stages of roll out in Thailand. Mimicking an excited puppy, K9 roams around the popular Central World mall in downtown Bangkok, drawing the attention of delighted children eager to get gel from a bottle attached to its back. “It’s convenient for people to wash their hands, just like a preventive measure... especially in this Covid-19 situation,” said Petra Saktidejbhanubandh, a marketing officer for mobile operator Advanced Info Services (AIS).AIS is aiming to roll out a 5G network for smartphones by the end of the year. K9’s 5G-powered comrades include ROC, which checks temperatures, and LISA, a customer service-bot. “For K9 especially, people just think it’s really cute,” Petra told AFP, adding they hope to dispel any fiction-fuelled fear of a robot takeover. “The robots are here to assist people, not to replace them.” But shopper Lapassanan Buranapatpakorn was unconvinced, saying that she found K9’s skeletal mechanical frame “creepy”. “I think the execution, like the robot itself, is a bit scary,” the 29-year-old said, though she admitted that giving out hand sanitiser is a “good idea”. Thailand has gradually lifted restriction on businesses, which have taken precautions such as seating customers apart in restaurants or erecting plastic dividers in massage parlors. The kingdom currently has 3,101 confirmed cases of the virus and 58 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robot-dog-hounds-thai-shoppers-to-keep-hands-coronavirus-free/story-Q3hZrBgZ4tHWElAQUnSvOM.html
08-06-2020||World||Obama urges 2020 graduates to vote for change in November||Former President Barack Obama urged Class of 2020 graduates to vote for change, saying protests alone won’t end discrimination and injustice that have sparked almost two weeks of nationwide demonstrations.Speaking in virtual commencement address on YouTube, Obama called on young Americans to play their part in democracy “even it all seems broken.”“I’ve noticed that there have been some debates among young people about how useful voting is compared to direct action and civil disobedience in ending discrimination in our society,” he said. “The fact is that we don’t have to choose, we need both.”Obama has shed the customary restraint of former presidents and criticized the Trump administration’s response during the coronavirus pandemic. Last month, he told graduates of historically black colleges that the outbreak shows that many of those in the government “aren’t even pretending to be in charge.”He also wrote lengthy posts on Medium and Instagram about the recent wave of protests against police brutality, and with a similar call to action.The coronavirus pandemic “just brought into focus problems that have been growing for a very long time,” Obama said Sunday, citing economic inequality, lack of basic health care, bigotry and political polarization.Decades of AnguishRecent protests “speak to decades worth of anguish and frustration over unequal treatment and a failure to reform police practices and the broader criminal justice system,” Obama said.Aspirations for change have to be translated into laws and institutional practices at every level of government, including those “that don’t get as much attention as a presidential race,” he said.Michelle Obama struck a similar tone at the virtual graduation, which featured A-list artists such as Taylor Swift, Lady Gaga and K-pop group BTS.“If you’re spending a lot of time just hashtagging and posting right now, that’s useful, especially during a pandemic,” the former first lady said. “But it’s only a beginning. Go further. Send all your friends a link to register to vote.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/obama-urges-2020-graduates-to-vote-for-change-in-november/story-yWE3RCeexmeAASpbbbCXRM.html

Lee back to jail after more than two years of freedom, as new allegations dog the executive and cast a pall over the country’s top conglomerate.Lee, 51, is scheduled to appear in the Seoul Central District Court at 10:30 a.m. (0230 GMT), then head to a detention centre to await the judge’s decision, expected as early as same day.Prosecutors on Thursday asked the court to issue an arrest warrant against Lee on suspicion of stock-price manipulation, audit-rule violations and other offences, culminating a probe into accounting fraud and a contentious 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates that they said helped smooth Lee’s succession.Samsung on Friday denied the stock-manipulation allegation against Lee, saying it was “beyond common sense” to claim Lee was involved in the decision-making.In a further statement over the weekend, the group said the lengthy probe is weighing on management, which is in a “crisis” at a time when Covid-19 and U.S.-China trade disputes are adding to uncertainty.Samsung said “groundless, incorrect and speculative media reports” about Lee would “never be desirable, not only for Samsung but for the future of the Korean economy.”The company declined to make Lee available for comment.He served in jail for about one year until Feb. 2018 for his role in a bribery scandal involving former President Park Geun-hye.He is also on trial on charges that he gave horses as gifts to win government support for the merger that increased his control of the group - and of its crown jewel, Samsung Electronics Co, South Korea’s biggest company - as he was preparing to succeed from his ailing father, Lee Kun-hee.“If he is arrested, this will further hurt the reputation of Lee and Samsung. There will more questions about his legitimacy as the CEO and successor of the company,” Chang Sea-jin, business professor at Korea Advanced Institute of Science & Technology. “The public would think, ‘Oh he may have done something wrong again.’“||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-court-to-decide-whether-to-jail-samsung-heir-jayy-lee-again/story-5cQXJThekB0Krxn75RPNwM.html

At least 6.9 million people have been infected across the world by the coronavirus, according to Johns Hopkins University.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHealth experts, however, believe that the John Hopkins tally falls short of showing the true tragedy of the pandemic and Worldometer, an online source for world statistics, showed that the number of cases had already crossed the grim 7 million mark on Sunday.China said it will strengthen international cooperation in future Covid-19 clinical vaccine trials, building on earlier collaboration in vaccine development.China is expending great efforts in the global scramble to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus epidemic that began in its central city of Wuhan, with Chinese researchers conducting five separate clinical trials on humans, or half of all such trials globally, according to the data compiled by the World Health Organization.President Xi Jinping had vowed last month at the World Heath Assembly, the WHO’s governing body, that vaccines China’s develops will become a “global public good” once they are ready for use, and it will be China’s contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries.Developing “a vaccine is still the fundamental strategy in our effort to overcome the new coronavirus,” Chinese science and technology minister Wang Zhigang said on Sunday.But vaccine development is very difficult and takes time, he said, when asked how China would initially prioritise shots by country if and when a vaccine is found.In a white paper released by the State Council Information Office at the news conference, the Chinese government urged global cooperation, saying the international community should resist finger-pointing and politicising the virus. It did not name any country.US President Donald Trump’s administration has been accusing China of cover-ups and lack of transparency regarding the pandemic. The head of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention briefed his US counterpart by phone on the then-unknown virus as early as January 4, according to the white paper.Meanshile, Shanghai Junshi Biosciences has started an early-stage study in China to test a potential antibody treatment in uninfected people, official paper Liberation Daily said on its online channel on Sunday.The experimental drug, JS016, is also expected to begin human study in the US in the second quarter of this year, through collaboration with Eli Lilly and Co.Junshi is among a few biotech firms and research institutes backed by global pharmaceutical giants to work on antibody-based therapies to help those infected with Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-top-7mn-china-promises-greater-collaboration-on-vaccine/story-8rikI1hgbxywSIPzIdgjJK.html
08-06-2020||World||Coronavirus vaccine will take minimum 1 year to be available widely: Singapore PM Lee||The much-needed vaccine to combat the coronavirus will take at least one year before it becomes available widely, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said on Sunday, urging the people to “learn to live” with Covid-19 for a long time.He asked Singaporeans to play their part in limiting the spread of the virus by maintaining personal hygiene, wearing masks, observing safe distancing rules and avoiding crowded gatherings.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It will take at least a year, probably longer, before vaccines become widely available,” said Lee in the first of six national broadcasts on Singapore’s future after the Covid-19 pandemic in the coming days. We will have to learn to live with Covid-19 for the long term, as we have done in the past with other dangerous infectious diseases, like tuberculosis,” Lee said.The prime minister also highlighted Singapore’s progress in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic.New cases in the wider community have come down and the situation in foreign workers living in dormitories has stabilised, Lee said.This has allowed the country to ease strict circuit breaker measures, he said, adding that the contact tracing and testing will be stepped up to detect the coronavirus cases earlier, isolate their contacts, and prevent clusters from forming.“If all goes well and the outbreak remains firmly under control, we will ease up further (on measures to control the spread of coronavirus), and resume more activities as soon as possible,” he said.The prime minister said that beyond the public health impact, Covid-19 had become a serious economic, social and political problem.“It is in fact the most dangerous crisis humanity has faced in a very long time... We are in a totally unprecedented situation,” he said. Pointing to the global economy having virtually ground to a halt, Lee said the governments have spent trillions of dollars to support businesses, economies and jobs, but still tens of millions of jobs have been lost. Singapore’s domestic economy has also taken a severe hit. The country’s gross domestic product is likely to shrink by between 4 and 7 per cent - its worst contraction ever. Singapore’s economy depends heavily on international trade and investments, which were already slowing down before the pandemic hit. “Now this slowdown will happen faster, and go further,” Lee said. The government has spent billions of dollars to save jobs and keep businesses afloat, and is doing so without having to borrow. On Friday, parliament passed a second supplementary supply Bill, bringing government spending on four Covid-19 support packages to Singapore dollars 92.9 billion or nearly 20 per cent of the country’s GDP. These will require a Singapore dollars 52 billion draw from Singapore’s past reserves. “But even for us, this level of spending is hard to sustain. More importantly, these measures cannot shield us from the tectonic shifts taking place in the global economy,” Lee conceded. The world will not return to the open and connected global economy of the past anytime soon, he said, adding that the movement of people will be more restricted, and health checks and quarantines will be the norm.Industries that depend on travel, like aviation, hotels and tourism, will take a long time to get back on their feet, and may never recover fully, Lee said, pointing out that it would no longer be easier to travel easily as has been happening. Countries will also strive to become less dependent on one another, especially for essential goods and services such as food or critical medical supplies, the prime minister said.“This will have strategic implications. Countries will have less stake in each other’s wellbeing. They will fight more over how the pie is shared, rather than work together to enlarge the pie for all. It will be a less prosperous world, and also a more troubled one. All these changes will impact Singapore greatly and mean that the next few years will be a disruptive and difficult time,” he cautioned. But the prime minister said Singapore will emerge stronger and better from the crisis. Singapore has an international reputation built up over decades, a headstart on preparing for the uncertainties ahead, and plans in place to help Singaporeans cope with the challenges, he said. Singapore Ministers will share more details at later broadcast as a follow up to the prime minister’s Sunday broadcast. Broadcasts have been scheduled between June 9 and June 20 by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat, Senior Ministers Teo Chee Hean and Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Trade and Industry Minister Chan Chun Sing and National Development Minister Lawrence Wong.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-vaccine-will-take-minimum-1-year-to-be-available-widely-singapore-pm-lee/story-Enm29EusgJi44KNVcFDTvN.html
08-06-2020||World||Anti-racism marches held across US, Europe, Asia||Tens of thousands of people marched in Washington DC in what was described as the city’s largest yet demonstration against institutional racism in the wake of the custodial death of African-American George Floyd.They walked to the White House, National Mall, the Lincoln Memorial and the Capitol, singing and chanting slogans — “No justice, no peace”, “Black lives matter” and “Defund the police”. Similar weekend protests were held in New York, Los Angeles, Detroit and other places, as well as in many cities globally.President Donald Trump, who is treating the protests as partisan and aimed at him, sought to underplay them. “Much smaller crowd in DC than anticipated,” he tweeted. “National Guard, Secret Service, and DC Police have been doing a fantastic job. Thank you!”Reports quoting US officials said on Sunday that Trump had wanted to call in 10,000 active duty troops, not the reservists of the National Guards now in DC and other cities. But he was persuaded against it by his top officials at a reportedly “contentious” meeting.A senior aide of the president’s re-election campaign, Mercedes Schlapp, has apologised for retweeting a video of a chainsaw wielding man running after protestors shouting racial slurs. With protests increasingly peaceful, law enforcement presence is being wound down across the country. National Guards are expected to begin leaving DC on Monday, as Trump confirmed in a tweet, with a warning that they can “quickly return”.Officials in New York city, which had another day of relative peace, decided to lift the curfew. Two police officers of Buffalo, New York state, were charged earlier for shoving an elderly man to the ground during protests, videos of which have gone viral triggering outrage . In Richmond, capital of Virginia state, a small group of protesters pulled down a statue of Confederate general Williams Carter Wickham. Around the world, protesters echoed the rage of American demonstrators. Dozens of people protested in front of the US consulate in Hong Kong on Sunday. In Bristol, England, protesters venting their anger at the country’s colonial history by toppling a statue of a 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston.

08-06-2020||World||Dutch nightclub resumes the party with social distancing rules||Dutch youth hit a club on Saturday, sort of, in one of the country’s first attempts to resume night life after the coronavirus outbreak, with social distancing rules still in place.Clubbers at Doornroosje in the eastern city of Nijmegen booked ahead of time to enjoy short sets of electronic dance music in the afternoon, rather than around midnight, as they used to. During the show, they were restricted to chairs.But when the lights went down and the sound came up, almost everything fell into place. “I expect amazing social dis-dancing!” said Nadie, a young woman who had come to see local favourite DJ Odin play. “I think it’s your perfect daily dose of music, like, 20 minutes is enough, yeah, sure.” said Nuray Boga, 19. “It made me happy.”Promoter Jonatan Brand said the original plan had been to have the guests dance while standing in place 1.5m apart. But local authorities said they had to sit in chairs, at least for now. “It’s still very cool,” Brand said. “People are still dancing, although they are on the chair, they’re fist-pumping, they’re moving their bodies, so - it’s great.”A maximum of 30 guests were allowed in the building at a time. The club plans to expand to 100 in July. The cover charge was 10 euros, including a drink. Shows did not sell out, and the event was also streamed online. “It’s nice to play actually on a loud volume again, to see some familiar faces,” said DJ Davy Brandts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-nightclub-resumes-the-party-with-social-distancing-rules/story-AVic4T5vNO77XeIav87nXJ.html
08-06-2020||World||Brazil govt removes virus toll, case data from official website||Brazil’s government has stopped publishing a running total of coronavirus deaths and infections in an extraordinary move that critics call an attempt to hide the true toll of the disease in Latin America’s largest nation.The Saturday move came after months of criticism from experts saying Brazil’s statistics are woefully deficient, and in some cases manipulated, so it may never be possible to gain a real understanding of the depth of the pandemic in the country.Brazil’s last official numbers showed it had recorded over 34,000 deaths related to the coronavirus, the third-highest number in the world, just ahead of Italy. It reported nearly 615,000 infections, putting it at the second-highest, behind the US. On Friday, the federal health ministry took down a website that had showed daily, weekly and monthly figures on infections and deaths in Brazilian states. On Saturday, the site returned but the total numbers of infections for states and the nation were no longer there. The site now shows only the numbers for the previous 24 hours.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro tweeted on Saturday that disease totals are “not representative” of the country’s current situation.A Bolsonaro ally contended to the newspaper O Globo that at least some states providing figures to the health ministry had sent falsified data, implying that they were exaggerating the toll. Carlos Wizard, a businessman expected to assume a high-level post in the Health Ministry, said the federal government would be conducting a review intended to determine a “more accurate”’ toll.“The number we have today is fanciful or manipulated,” Wizard said. A council of state health secretaries said it would fight the changes by Bolsonaro, who has dismissed the gravity of the coronavirus pandemic and tried to thwart attempts to impose quarantines, curfews and social distancing, arguing those steps are causing more damage to the economy than the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-govt-removes-virus-toll-case-data-from-official-website/story-UpdBJ7CJaGC8nQxxNYLyUK.html
