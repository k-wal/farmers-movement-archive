The fund distribution would occur this week, according to the agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-government-offers-25-billion-in-covid-19-relief-to-some-hospitals/story-Y401gm9r5byncJOUnYcaUK.html
09-06-2020||World||Indian women 25% less likely to own mobile phones: Oxford||Mobile phones are empowering women in various countries but gender inequalities in access continue: women in India are 25 per cent likely to own mobile phones, compared to men, according to data compiled by experts at the University of Oxford.The data and a related study, published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, show that access to mobile phones is associated with lower gender inequalities, enhanced contraceptive use and lower maternal and child mortality.Although these effects are global, the link between mobile phone access and the social development indicators is stronger in the developing world, says the study’s co-author Ridhi Kashyap, professor in the Department of Sociology.She said: “Significant gender inequalities in mobile phone access still exist across the world, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. This study highlights the urgent need to address these inequalities to be able to realise the empowering potential of the technology”.The study’s findings, Kashyap adds, are “highly relevant” in Indian context, where women often face greater barriers to accessing information important for their health, accessing economic and financial resources, as well as communication networks relevant for their well-being.Besides the 25% gender gap in India, the data suggests that when women in the country have access to mobile phones, it is often also likely to be shared, and when women are able to use these devices is curtailed.According to the study, women who own a mobile phone are better informed about sexual and reproductive health services and empowered to make independent decisions. The study looked at the relationship between mobile access and multiple indicators linked to global sustainable development in more than 200 countries between 1993 and 2017.The study’s lead author Valentina Rotondi says: “Our findings highlight the importance of investing in cheaper and equitable access to mobile connectivity, enabling independent mobile ownership, and focusing on ICT skill development, especially among women”.“These measures can forge a promising pathway for attaining sustainable development. Our study provides large-scale empirical evidence for the words pronounced in 2003 by Nobel Peace Laureate Muhammad Yunus…that the quickest way to get out of poverty right now is to have a mobile telephone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-women-25-less-likely-to-own-mobile-phones-oxford/story-CJsgJzhvjzcdekB9g7nrMO.html

09-06-2020||World||UK drops plan to get all young children in school by summer||The British government on Tuesday ditched plans to have all primary school children in England return to the classroom before the summer vacation after schools voiced worries about their ability to meet coronavirus social distancing requirements.Education Secretary Gavin Williamson admitted that the goal for approximately 5 million primary schoolchildren from age 4 to 11 wasn’t possible, given constraints related to classroom sizes, the need for social distancing and inadequate numbers of teachers.“We believe this cautious, phased return is the most sensible course of action to take,” Williamson told lawmakers when announcing the change.However, he said the government would like to see schools that “have the capacity” bring back more pupils before the summer break in July.Although many of England’s primary schools have been open this entire spring for the children of key workers — including health care professionals, delivery drivers and journalists — the Conservative government had planned to give all younger pupils the chance to return following months of home learning.Last week, the very youngest schoolchildren were allowed to return as well as those in their final year of primary school who are due to make the transition to secondary school in September. The plan was that all others would return in stages.Williamson said just over 50% of primary schools reopened to more children last week and that this increased to more than 70% by Monday.“The ‘ambition’ to bring back all primary year groups for a month before the end of the summer term was a case of the government over-promising something that wasn’t deliverable,’’ said Geoff Barton, general-secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders.Williamson said secondary schools would still provide face-to-face support for some children from next week, and that exams will go ahead next year.The U.K., which has the world’s second-highest virus-related death toll behind the U.S. at just under 40,900, is generally seeing lockdown restrictions ease.The government confirmed Tuesday that all nonessential shops in England, such as department stores and electronics retailers, can reopen Monday provided they conduct a Covid-19 risk assessment and can maintain social distancing guidelines so the people inside stay at least two meters (6 1/2 feet) apart.Getting Covid-ready is difficult, as English schools have found out.The government wants class sizes capped at 15 so that social distancing rules can be followed. Given the small size of many U.K. classrooms, many schools have had to limit teaching groups to just 10 children.Schools have introduced staggered starting and ending times to make sure there’s as little crossover as possible between children, and playgrounds have been divided into sections so groups don’t mix.In addition, many schools are having children eat packed lunches at their desks or outside in playgrounds, and insist on a change of clothes every day. Some have abandoned uniform requirements. Schools have also introduced regular cleaning of the classrooms both during and after the school day, in addition to a weekly deep cleaning. One-way walking systems have also been put into place around school buildings to limit interactions between groups.These are profound changes to the way schools operate and there are mounting concerns that the impact will reverberate into the next school year, which begins in September.“Government now needs to provide urgent clarity on the anticipated constraints that schools may face in September, so that schools and parents can start to look ahead and plan with greater understanding of the possible disruption,” said Paul Whiteman, general secretary of school leaders’ union NAHT.Amid all the confusion, there are worries over the educational and emotional damage on children whose schooling has been interrupted for so long.Elsewhere in the U.K., Scotland and Northern Ireland have said schools won’t be reopening until August, while Wales is making plans to welcome students back later this month.Conservative lawmaker Robert Halfon, chairman of the Commons Education Committee, urged the government to reconsider and warned of an “epidemic of educational poverty.”“Why is it that we can turn a blind eye to thousands of demonstrators, campaign for pubs and garden centers to open, yet it is so hard to reopen our schools?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-drops-plan-to-get-all-young-children-in-school-by-summer/story-u1BfW9QiLPvXJt7fOhonSI.html

Floyd’s last words — “I can’t breathe” — became a rallying cry for antiracism protestors in the United States and around the world in London, Paris, Berlin, Rio de Janeiro, Japan, Sweden, Australia, New Zealand, Kenya, Zimbabwe, South Africa, despite the deadly Covid-19 pandemic.Protests have continued int he United States, but first steps are also being taken towards addressing the problem of continuing racism in US law enforcement.Congressional Democrats introduced a sweeping legislation on Monday to ban the use of chokeholds, a technique officers are known to use to subdue suspects, end no-knock warrants and create a national data base of police misconduct to prevent tainted officers from finding employment elsewhere.Demand has been growing also for curtailing police funding and powers and in the most consequential of moves yet, the city council of Minneapolis has vowed to disband the Minneapolis Police Department and replace it with community-based safety model, details of which remain sketchy.President Donald Trump has defended the police saying “99.9%” of them are “great, great people” and went on question the motives of a 75-year-old demonstrator pushed to the ground and left bleeding by officers in Buffalo.He assured law enforcement representatives from across the country at a roundtable Monday there “won’t be defunding, there won’t be dismantling of our police”.The president conceded there are some “bad actors” among the police and “sometimes you’ll see some horrible things, like we witnessed recently” referring to the Floyd killing” but offered a broad defense saying “99 -- I say 99.9, but let’s go with 99 percent of them are great, great people”.On Tuesday morning, he tweeted in defense of the police of Buffalo, New York, where two officers have been fired and charged for pushing a 75-year-old man to the ground and left him bleeding on the ground. “Buffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur,” the president tweeted, claiming he “was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment”.The president presented no evidence to back that up and said “I watched, he fell harder than was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?” sparking another round of outrage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-to-be-laid-to-rest-in-a-grave-next-to-his-mother-s-today/story-61MkjY2eev6Ob29PjA7DEN.html

To avoid losing count, he throws a stick into a bowl every time he completes a lap.Leempoels said the idea came to him when he saw World War Two veteran Tom Moore, 100, strike a chord in Britain by raising the equivalent of more than $40 million for the country’s health service by walking around his garden.“My children said that I can walk at least as well as Tom Moore and on top of that I am 103 years old,” he told Reuters.“So they suggested that maybe I should do something. My granddaughter had just run a marathon and as a joke I said: I will run a marathon.”Leempoels hopes to raise funds for the hospital attached to the nearby university of Leuven, where researchers are working to find a cure for Covid-19.So far he has raised just over 6,000 euros, according to Marlies Vanderbruggen of Leuven University, and has covered about one third of the distance of a marathon.Leempoels recalls people falling sick during the 1957-58 Asian flu pandemic, but recovering much more quickly than those affected by the novel coronavirus in recent months.“As a doctor you feel touched by this and that’s why I was happy now that I might be able to contribute something to fight the coronavirus,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/103-year-old-belgian-doctor-is-walking-marathon-around-his-garden-to-raise-funds-for-covid-research/story-UsrNrBpCrE2SyiuHQxVS7L.html

Johnson appointed Sunak as the chancellor and Patel as the home secretary.He said: “Yes, I am proud to lead the most ethnically diverse government in the history of this country, with two of the four great offices of state held by a man and a woman of Indian origin…This country has made huge strides”.“But we must also frankly acknowledge that there is so much more to do…And so I say yes, you are right, we are all right, to say Black Lives Matter; and to all those who have chosen to protest peacefully and who have insisted on social distancing – I say, yes of course I hear you, and I understand”.“But I must also say that we are in a time of national trial, when for months this whole country has come together to fight a deadly plague…So no, I will not support those who flout the rules on social distancing…and no, I will not support or indulge those who break the law, or attack the police, or desecrate public monuments”. he said.Referring to demands to remove statues of controversial figures installed across the UK over centuries and decades, Johnson said if those who want to change the urban landscape of the country, they can stand for election, or vote for someone who will. Pulling down Colston’s statue has revived the demand to remove the statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes in Oxford. Thousands have signed a petition to remove Clive’s statue in Shropshire, while others want the stature of 19th century slave trader Thomas Picton in Wales to be pulled down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-i-hear-you-but-don-t-break-law-pm-boris-tells-protestors/story-KRop3zZM0NAr7nQsFmmidL.html

It might re-open during the summer.”The statement said ground markings will be put in place to ensure people keep their distance from one another, with “daily cleaning and disinfection of public spaces at the tower.”The monument, completed in 1889, receives about seven million visitors every year, about three-quarters of them from abroad, according to the tower website.The tourism industry of France, one of the world’s most visited countries, has taken a hard hit under a lockdown to halt the Covid-19 pandemic, with hotels, restaurants, museums, and theatres closed.These included some of the French capital’s most famous landmarks such as the Louvre museum, due to reopen on July 6, and the Palace of Versailles which opened Saturday.“The re-opening date of our online ticket office will be soon communicated,” said the Eiffel website.“We strongly encourage our visitors to opt for online ticket purchase, in order to avoid the wait at the Tower’s ticket offices.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eiffel-tower-to-reopen-to-public-on-june-25/story-mXkTQFhnwLTq7fEoaAxo8K.html

Nepal claims Lipulekh but the Indian side has said the road is completely within its territory.The amendment, which requires a two-thirds majority in both houses of Nepal’s Parliament, is certain to be passed as all key parties, including the opposition Nepali Congress and Madhes-based parties, have backed it.Also read: The costs of anti-Indian nationalism in Nepal | HT EditorialThe move in Parliament followed after several efforts by Kathmandu to hold talks with New Delhi on the border row. People familiar with developments said Nepal last formally contacted India early in May for talks to resolve the issue.There was no formal word from Indian officials on Tuesday’s development in Nepal.Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali told Parliament that the new road to Lipulekh had “undermined” the country’s sovereignty.Nepal’s border begins at Limpiyadhura, the origin of the river Kali, and the border with India is determined by the Treaty of Sugauli of 1816, he said. India, he added, had acknowledged in 1997 that the borders at Kalapani and Susta were “unresolved”.Gyawali also said Nepal was still awaiting a response from India on holding talks to resolve the border row that has strained bilateral relations. He told The Associated Press on Tuesday that requests for talks were made last November and December, and again in May.Also read: Decoding the India-Nepal dispute | Opinion“We have expressed time and again that Nepal wants to sit at the table to resolve this problem,” he said. “We are waiting for formal negotiations so that these two countries with...a very unique type of partnership can develop a more inspiring relationship that reflects the requirements of the 21st century.”In Parliament, Janata Samajbadi Party leader Rajendra Shrestha said there should be no compromise on an issue involving national sovereignty and integrity. Nepali Congress’ chief whip Bal Krishna Khand said his party had already decided to back the amendment. However, Khand also said the government should expedite efforts for a diplomatic dialogue with India.After the issue flared up, the government of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli issued a new political map on May 20 that showed Limpiyadhura, Lipulekh and Kalapani as Nepalese territory.Nepal’s parliamentarians now have three days to register changes to the amendment, following which it will be presented for a vote in the two houses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/to-legally-support-new-map-nepal-s-lawmakers-discuss-amendment/story-SnXkv3CTNaTiqXHeH07ahI.html

The number of available jobs fell 16% from March to 5 million. Hires declined 31% to 3.5 million.The grim April — which followed an bleaker March with 11.5 million layoffs — suggests that the economy could take time to recover nearly a decade’s worth of gains that vanished in two months. Hiring did rebound in May as 2.5 million jobs were added on net, the government said Friday. But those gains appeared to reflect temporarily laid-off employees returning to work and increases in people with part-time jobs, rather than an economy at full throttle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-employers-laid-off-7-7-million-workers-in-april/story-aBSW0HIVaBHwksr7BIwl2L.html

09-06-2020||World||Pak authorities retrieve landing gear, part of cockpit of crashed PIA plane||Pakistani authorities on Tuesday retrieved the landing gear and parts of the cockpit of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) aircraft that crashed in a residential area in Karachi last month.The PIA plane, with 99 people on board, crashed in Model Colony near Jinnah International Airport Karachi on May 22, killing 97 people (89 passengers and eight crew members). Two passengers miraculously survived.“We have retrieved the landing and parts of the cockpit from the crash site and transferred it to the airport,” a PIA official told PTI.He said the plane’s engine will be retrieved by Wednesday.He said the team, comprising Air Force, Civil Aviation Authority, the PIA and Karachi Port Trust officials, used a crane weighing 70 tonnes to retrieve the remaining parts of the crashed plane. The cockpit voice recorder (CVR) and flight data recorder (FDR) of the Airbus A-320 have already been retrieved from the crash site and sent to France to download the data.The French Air Safety Organisation has successfully downloaded the data and sent its report to the Pakistan government. The government will make a preliminary report about the crash public on June 22.The four-member investigation team’s main focus so far has been on the first failed landing and go-around (re-take off) of the ill-fated PK-8303 flight.Some retired and serving pilots have raised eyebrows about the role of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) following the publication of the communication between the pilot of the plane and the air traffic controller.“The four-member team of investigators headed by Air Commodore Usman Ghani has recorded the statements of the air traffic controllers concerned and the runway inspection team. The controllers in question have been stopped from working until the fixing of responsibility for the crash.So far the investigators have collected evidence -- runway pictures, aircraft parts, records of communication between controllers and pilot, recording by the radar, and other related materials. The investigators are mandated to spot and fix responsibility for violations in the aviation procedures and suggest a remedy to avoid a repeat.According to a former air traffic controller, the aircraft was kept with ‘approach controllers’ all the time as per the procedure.“The pilot did not call tower frequency at any time during the flight and was in contact with the ATC till he crashed. The role of co-pilot will come to fore through the material stored in the voice recorder.” The controller says the pilot did not report any emergency after he tried to land the first time. He was told that at 3,500ft he was a bit high on approach so he may descend to 2,000ft or so in a circle, but he said he was comfortable and continued straight on.“Once the pilot realised that he could not make a proper landing, he went around from a very low height, more than scraping the runway and in the process, the engines were damaged,” he said.“ATC gave him clearance to come back and land on any runway and stopped all traffic for him. The plane had already damaged its engines, and it crashed a mile short of the runway,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-authorities-retrieve-landing-gear-part-of-cockpit-of-crashed-pia-plane/story-nfSNZdk3JyqtJtA6iTOxAJ.html

The company said on Tuesday it had signed a second set of deals with authorities in the United states backing its development of a monoclonal antibody treatment against the coronavirus. It declined to disclose details of the agreement but said it had agreed terms with the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) to move two Covid-19 antibody therapies it has licensed from researchers into clinical studies in the next two months.Companies and governments are scrambling to bring a solution for the illness caused by the new coronavirus to market as soon as possible, and many in the medical community believe antibody-based therapies hold great potential.The United States has already secured 300 million doses of AstraZeneca’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine, AZD1222, and Defense Secretary Mark Esper vowed last month that the U.S. military and other parts of the government would work with the private sector to produce a vaccine at scale by year-end.AstraZeneca said it has licensed six monoclonal antibody candidates from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tennessee. Two of those six prospective proteins will be tested as a combination approach for Covid-19. Antibodies are generated in the body to fight off infection. Monoclonal antibodies mimic natural antibodies and can be isolated and manufactured in large quantities to treat diseases in patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-wins-fresh-us-backing-in-race-for-covid-19-treatment/story-Rsez0xvB889cPqt4vp76CL.html

On May 25, as a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck, the dying man cried out for his mother.His funeral will be private. Some 6,000 people attended a public memorial service was held Monday in Houston, where he grew up.Under a blazing Texas sun, mourners wearing T-shirts with Floyd’s picture or the words “I Can’t Breathe” — one of the other things he cried out repeatedly while pinned down by the police officer — waited for hours to pay their respects. Floyd’s body, dressed in a brown suit, lay in an open gold-colored casket.Also read: Bail set at $1 million for police officer charged with George Floyd’s murderShorty after the memorial ended, Floyd’s casket was placed in a hearse and escorted by police back to a funeral home.As the hearse drove away, 39-year-old Daniel Osarobo, a Houston resident who immigrated from Nigeria, could be heard saying, “Rest in power. Rest In Peace.”“I’ve been stopped by police. I understand the situation. I can only imagine,” said Osarobo, who works as an engineer in the oil and gas industry. “What if it was me?

What if it was my son?” ALSO WATCH | Dwayne Johnson calls for justice amid protests in US over George Floyd’s deathThose were questions many black Americans have asked not just in recent weeks, but for decades.Floyd’s death sparked international protests and drew new attention to the treatment of African Americans in the U.S. by police and the criminal justice system. In the past two weeks, sweeping and previously unthinkable things have taken place: Confederate statues have been toppled, police departments around America have rethought the way they patrol minority neighborhoods, legislatures have debated use-of-force policies, and white, black and brown people have had uncomfortable, sometimes heated, discussions about race in a nation that is supposed to ensure equal opportunity for all.Also read | ‘It just hurts’: Thousands mourn George Floyd in Texas amid calls for reformCalls for “defunding the police” have cropped up in many communities, and people around the world have taken to the streets in solidarity, saying that reforms and dialogue must not stop with Floyd’s funeral.His death has also reshaped the presidential race. To be re-elected, President Donald Trump must rebound from one of the lowest points of his presidency, with recent polls showing that 8 in 10 Americans believe the country is headed in the wrong direction and even spiraling out of control. The president got a boost late last week with a better-than-expected jobs report, but he’s struggling to show consistent leadership on multiple fronts, including the nationwide protests against police brutality.Meanwhile, former Vice President Joe Biden met with Floyd’s family Monday, according to a photo posted on Twitter by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Biden will provide a video message for Floyd’s funeral service. Previous memorials have taken place in Minneapolis and Raeford, North Carolina, near where Floyd was born.The memorials have drawn the families of black victims in other high-profile killings whose names have become seared into America’s conversations on race — among them Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin.“It just hurts,” said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd’s brother, sobbing as he ticked off some of their names outside The Fountain of Praise church. “We will get justice. We will get it. We will not let this door close.”For 14 nights, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in protest of police brutality and racial inequality. Cities imposed curfews as some of the demonstrations were later marred by spasms of arson, assaults and smash-and-grab raids on businesses. More than 10,000 people have been arrested around the country, according to reports tracked by The Associated Press.But protests in recent days have been overwhelmingly peaceful — and over the weekend, several police departments appeared to retreat from aggressive tactics. Thousands of Los Angeles protesters arrested for violating curfew and other police orders will not be charged with a crime, prosecutors said Monday.Four Minneapolis officers were charged in connection with Floyd’s death, which was captured on video by bystanders, who begged police to stop hurting him.A Minnesota judge on Monday kept bail at $1.25 million for Derek Chauvin, the police officer charged with second-degree murder in Floyd’s death. Chauvin’s former co-workers, J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao, are charged as accomplices.The 44-year-old Chauvin said almost nothing during the 11-minute hearing while appearing on closed-circuit television from a maximum-security prison.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-whose-death-sparked-racial-injustice-movement-to-be-buried/story-6FcmGeQboevO20nDatlSgJ.html

Security Council to “reconsider sanctions” on the isolated country so as to ensure the flow of food supplies.“There have been reports of an increase of homeless people in large cities – including kotjebi (street children), and medicine prices have reportedly skyrocketed. An increasing number of families eat only twice a day, or eat only corn, and some are starving,” he said in a statement.Elisabeth Byrs, spokeswoman of the U.N.’s World Food Programme (WFP), told a Geneva news briefing that the humanitarian situation in North Korea “remains bleak”, with some 10 million, or 40% of the population, needing humanitarian aid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-starving-in-north-korea-10-million-need-humanitarian-aid-says-un-expert/story-ksZ8OVlcaDzDSiu5LEuGpI.html

The 2016 ‘Rhodes Must Fall’ campaign called for removing his statue in Oriel College in Oxford, but campaigners plan to take to the streets again on Tuesday.Britain’s long history of colonialism and involvement in slave trade has been a subject of much debate, but protests in Bristol as part of the BLM movement led to the statue of a prominent 17th century slave trader, Edward Colston, being pulled down on Sunday.The slave trade from the 16th to 19th centuries was carried through several ports, including London, Liverpool and Bristol. The focus has also moved to East India Company colonialists such as Robert Clive, whose statue in Shropshire is now sought to be removed.Setting up a Commission for Diversity in the Public realm, Khan said: “Our capital’s diversity is our greatest strength, yet our statues, road names and public spaces reflect a bygone era. It is an uncomfortable truth that our nation and city owes a large part of its wealth to its role in the slave trade and while this is reflected in our public realm, the contribution of many of our communities to life in our capital has been wilfully ignored”.“This cannot continue. We must ensure that we celebrate the achievements and diversity of all in our city, and that we commemorate those who have made London what it is – that includes questioning which legacies are being celebrated”.“The Black Lives Matter protests have rightly brought this to the public’s attention, but it’s important that we take the right steps to work together to bring change and ensure that we can all be proud of our public landscape,” he added.Oxford vice-chancellor Louise Richardson, had opposed to the campaign to remove Rhodes’ statue in 2016, saying: “I don’t think we can take down every statue or memorial of somebody who has done something that is objectionable today.”“The American declaration of independence was written by slave owners who were still extraordinary men. The world is a complex place, history is complex; we should be aware of it,” she said.Anti-colonial, anti-racist campaigns have spread in other campuses and countries, including South Africa. In 2017, students at the School of Oriental and African Studies wanted the curriculum revised to drop ‘white’ figures such as Plato and Socrates, and replace them with Indian and non-western philosophers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-focus-shifts-to-oxford-slave-linked-statues-in-london/story-yn1xsRVsFt3h1E4Lgcy44N.html

Washington blamed Soleimani for masterminding attacks by Iran-aligned militias on US forces in the region. “Mahmoud Mousavi-Majd, one of the spies for CIA and Mossad has been sentenced to death. He gave the whereabouts of martyr Soleimani to our enemies,” judiciary spokesman Gholamhossein Esmaili said in a televised news conference. Following Soleimani’s killing Iran retaliated with a rocket attack on Iraq’s Ain al-Asad base where US forces were stationed on Jan. 8. No US troops were killed or faced immediate bodily injury, but hundreds were later diagnosed with traumatic brain injury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-will-execute-cia-agent-involved-in-commander-soleimani-s-killing/story-W2RONfdGmTeREtbbfAYHlL.html

China has ramped up fighter flights and warship crossings near Taiwan or through the Taiwan Strait since President Tsai Ing-wen was first elected in 2016, as she has refused to acknowledge that the island is part of “one China”.Beijing claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has vowed to one day seize it, by force if necessary.Tsai lashed out at Beijing for “meaningless and unnecessary” military moves after a Chinese military jet in February briefly crossed the median line of the Taiwan Strait separating the two sides.It was the first major incursion since Tsai’s landslide re-election in January.Beijing also sent its new aircraft carrier, the Shandong, through the strait in December, shortly before Taiwan’s presidential election.In March last year, two Chinese J-11 fighter jets crossed over the line for the first time in years, prompting Taipei to accuse Beijing of violating a long-held tacit agreement in a “reckless and provocative” move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-fighter-jets-briefly-entered-airspace-says-taiwan-s-defence-ministry/story-Adkho3A0sMRMTgVihHRxPN.html

He is seen wearing a large, heavy chain, a do-rag and a baseball cap.As soon as the photo surfaced on social media, it created controversy. Staffers at the magazine criticised Rapoport after the photo, of him and his wife, circulated on Twitter. In the screenshot, his wife tagged the photo “boricua,” a reference to Puerto Ricans, and called Rapoport “papi”.In an Instagram post, Rapoport said he was stepping down as editor “to reflect on the work that I need to do as a human being.” He said the photo was of an “extremely ill-conceived” Halloween costume 16 years ago. He acknowledged “blind spots” as an editor and said the magazine’s staff and readers deserved better leadership. A post shared by Adam Rapoport (@rapoport) on Jun 8, 2020 at 4:21pm PDTThe issue comes at a wrong time for Conde Nast-owned magazine which has been trying to tap into the anti-racial protests, saying recently that it will be highlighting more black-owned food businesses and “tackling more of the racial and political issues at the core of the food world.”This comes days after the Philadelphia Inquirer’s senior vice president and executive editor Stan Wischnowski stepped down. His resignation came after an uproar over the ‘Buildings Matter, Too’ headline lamenting damage to businesses amid turbulent protests over death of George Floyd. The protesters damaged buildings and other things while denouncing police brutality against people of colour.The Inquirer had apologised for a “horribly wrong” decision to use the headline on a column last week about looting and vandalism on the margins of protests.In its apology piece, The Inquirer that the headline “offensively riffed” on the Black Lives Matter movement. It called the error unacceptable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bon-appetit-s-top-editor-resigns-over-racially-insensitive-photo/story-0jOdzq5afQHiGRZrFN3awN.html
09-06-2020||World||After Wuhan, China conducts mass testing in the city of Mudanjiang||Mass nucleic acid testing on more than 7.84 lakh residents in a city in northeastern China close to the Russian and North Korean borders has revealed 19 asymptomatic carriers, local officials have said.The tests were carried out in a week between June 1 and June 8.The city of Mudanjiang in the Heilongjiang province, home to more than 2.5 million people, is the second city after the central Chinese city of Wuhan to carry out large-scale testing of residents to find silent spreaders and the incidence of Covid-19 disease in the population.More tests on the remaining population are likely to be carried out in the coming days. Thousands of medical workers have been deployed across the city to carry out the tests.Like in Wuhan, it is likely that medics in Mudanjiang are pooling swab samples to complete the tests in quick time.The large-scale testing in Mudanjiang was ordered after local health authorities found 15 carriers with no outward signs of the disease in the city.In Wuhan, 300 asymptomatic patients were found after more than 9.8 million residents were tested; the expenditure involved was around 900 million yuan ($126 million), which was borne by the Wuhan government.With the coronavirus outbreak now under control in China, health authorities are now focusing on wide testing to find out and isolate asymptomatic carriers and those who could have been exposed to the disease.The national health commission (NHC) said eight categories of people would have to be mandatorily tested for the disease to prevent a resurgence of the disease, which have infected more than 83000 and killed 4634 people in the country.The list comprises overseas returnees, medical workers, patients admitted in fever clinics, new patients admitted to hospitals and their contacts, close contacts of confirmed Covid-19 patients, personnel deployed at epidemic control clinics at the border, prison staff and employees at facilities for senior citizens.The categorisation of vulnerable groups is aimed at preventing a rebound of the outbreak in China.It will help authorities to remain on guard against imported cases and have a monitoring system focussed on healthcare workers.Meanwhile, the large-scale nucleic acid testing in Wuhan revealed 300 asymptomatic carriers but none of the related throat swabs and sputum samples have cultivated coronavirus, the municipal health commission has said.Experts believe that the concentrations of coronavirus in the samples are extremely low or no pathogenic virus exists.“Personal belongings of the asymptomatic carriers such as toothbrushes, mugs, masks and towels have shown negative Covid-19 testing results in samples collected from the surfaces,” official news agency, Xinhua reported.A total of 1,174 close contacts of the 300 cases have also been tested negative for coronavirus, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-wuhan-china-conducts-mass-testing-in-the-city-of-mudanjiang/story-qcVbsu3mr7T7yczs4bPgtI.html
09-06-2020||World||President Trump says police forces will not be defunded, dismantled||US President Donald Trump has ruled out defunding or dismantling the police departments in the American cities, saying members of the force risk their own lives to protect others.Trump’s remark came on Monday amidst the growing demand from a section of the Americans to defund the police in the aftermath of the custodial death of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis on May 25. “We won’t be defunding our police, we won’t be dismantling our police. We won’t be disbanding our police, we won’t be ending our police force in a city. I guess you might have some cities that want to try but it’s going to be a very sad situation if they did because people are going to be protected,” Trump said during a White House round table with the law enforcement officials from across the country.Floyd, the 46-year-old victim from Houston, was handcuffed and pinned to the ground by the white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath on May 25 in Minneapolis. Floyd’s death triggered nationwide violent protests with a section of the protesters resorting to looting and rioting across the country, leaving behind a trail of destruction.In Minneapolis, Derek Chauvin, the police officer charged with the second-degree murder without intent, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, made his first court appearance. The court set him a bail of USD 1 million. The Democrats, opponents of President Trump and rights bodies have started demanding that the police be defunded in the wake of series of killings of African-Americans in the country.Trump outrightly rejected any such move. “These people do a tremendous job of protecting citizens of our country. ..But whether they were paid or not, that’s what they do. ….They protect people, risk their own lives for people they’ve never seen before, people in many cases they don’t know,” he said.Referring to the decline in crime rates as shown in the latest statistics, Trump said that the Police has done a fantastic job. “We have among the best numbers we’ve ever had in terms of recorded history certainly, but this has been a very strong year for less crime-let’s put it that way-less crime; and there’s a reason for less crime, that’s because we have great law enforcement,” Trump said, as he rejected the demands being made by his political opponents and rights bodies.“I am very proud of them. There won’t be defunding, there won’t be dismantling of our police and there are not going to be in the disbanding of our police. Our police have been letting us live in peace and we want to make sure we don’t have any bad actors in there,” Trump said.Earlier, the White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said that the President is appalled by the “Defund the Police” movement. “The fact that you have sitting congresswomen wanting to defund the police -- notably Rashida Tlaib; notably Biden advisor AOC, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez; former Clinton and Eric Holder spokesperson Brian Fallon wanting to defund our police across this country -- it is extraordinary,” she said in response to a question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/president-trump-says-police-forces-will-not-be-defunded-dismantled/story-4ndQ7nxt0vooFX3gNarl8H.html

Construction of the Great Wall, which is split into sections that in total stretch for thousands of kilometres, first began in the third century BC and continued for centuries. The Northern Line, also known as “Genghis Khan’s Wall” in reference to the legendary Mongolian conqueror, was built between the 11th and 13th centuries with pounded earth and dotted with 72 structures in small clusters.Shelach-Lavi and his team of Israeli, Mongolian and American researchers used drones, high-resolution satellite images and traditional archaeological tools to map out the wall and find artefacts that helped pin down dates.According to Shelach-Lavi, whose findings from the ongoing study were published in the journal Antiquity, the Northern Line has been largely overlooked by contemporary scientists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/part-of-china-s-great-wall-built-to-monitor-civillian-movement-not-for-war-study/story-GQgtRXo8rOL5BSk18kxFxM.html

In doing so, they are perhaps seeking publicity rather than accepting the assistance proffered,” the lawyers said.Hours later, the US attorney in Manhattan, Geoffrey S. Berman, issued a statement saying the prince had tried to “falsely portray himself to the public as eager and willing to cooperate” even as he repeatedly declined to schedule an interview.“If Prince Andrew is, in fact, serious about cooperating with the ongoing federal investigation, our doors remain open, and we await word of when we should expect him,” Berman said.Berman’s statement addressed only Prince Andrew’s willingness to be interviewed. It made no mention of the claims by his lawyers that the Department of Justice had advised them that Andrew is not a target of the investigation, or that they made any promise that whatever he told investigators would be confidential.Before Monday, Berman had said that Andrew has provided “zero cooperation” to American investigators.Epstein killed himself in a US jail last summer as he awaited trial on sex trafficking charges.One of the women who was sexually abused by Epstein as a teenager, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, has claimed that the financier flew her around the world on private planes to have sex with powerful men, and that she had sexual encounters with Andrew in London and New York, starting when she was 17.Andrew denies the allegation.The contrasting views of what is going on behind the scenes came after The Sun newspaper and other media organizations reported that the US Department of Justice had submitted a mutual legal assistance request to Britain’s Home Office. Such requests are used in criminal cases under a treaty and are generally used when material can’t be obtained on a police cooperation basis.US investigators are still examining potential criminality by Epstein’s associates. Multiple women have said the financier had helpers who recruited underage girls into a network of sexual servants.Andrew’s help is being sought as a witness, his lawyers said.“Far from our client acting above the law, as has been implied by press briefings in the US, he is being treated by a lower standard than might reasonably be expected for any other citizen,’’ Blackfords said. “Further, those same breaches of confidentiality by the DOJ have given the global media – and, therefore, the worldwide audience – an entirely misleading account of our discussions with them.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prosecutors-spar-with-prince-andrew-in-epstein-probe/story-yY1BuejhPsevws8Veyr2xL.html

Opposition leaders accused Trudeau of ‘hypocrisy’. Trudeau took a knee at that event on Parliament Hill in Ottawa in memory of African-American George Floyd, who died late last month after a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck while he lay handcuffed on the ground, sparking off both peaceful protests and violent rioting in the United States.Opposition leader Andrew Scheer addressed the matter in Parliament on Monday and said he understood why some people were “upset and confused” at seeing Trudeau “completely ignore those types of health guidelines or recommendations.” Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam had warned against public protests and recommended virtual protests instead.Scheer also tweeted, “Trudeau: you cannot attend funerals, visit dying relatives, or attend church services Also Trudeau: it’s ok for me to attend mass public gatherings Do you think that’s fair?”He was backed by the leader of the Bloc Quebecois Yves-François Blanchet who described Trudeau’s presence at the protest as an avoidable publicity stunt, according to the outlet CBC News. It quoted him as saying, “That is not the best place for the prime minister, or for me, to be. We have other occasions, opportunities to speak but it is quite characteristic of this Prime Minister — working with symbols, symbolic gestures.”CBC also reported that around 4,000 people attended the rally and “few of them practised physical distancing” while some of the protestors did not wear masks, though Trudeau did. It also noted that Trudeau shook hands with some of the protestors “something public health officials have warned against.”Trudeau defended his action at his daily media briefing on the coronavirus crisis, saying the “right balance” was required between the right to protest and public health measures. He said he went to the rally to “show support and listen to what community leaders and Black Canadians are calling for.”Ottawa is in the province of Ontario, which along with Quebec, accounts for the vast majority of infections and fatalities in the country. Social gatherings in Ontario are capped at five persons, though that limit will be doubled on June 12. Over 7,800 deaths have been reported in total and more than 96000 persons infected so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-trudeau-defends-decision-to-attend-protest-amid-covid-19-curbs/story-2wod0tMa14ho2WttnSDssJ.html

The event was called Dear Class of 2020. “I don’t think this is the graduation ceremony any of you imagined. At a time when you should be celebrating all the knowledge you’ve gained, you may be grieving what you’ve lost: the moves you planned, the jobs you earned, and the experiences you were looking forward to. In bleak moments like these, it can be difficult to find hope,” Pichai said, reports news agency PTI.Referring to the crises that previous generations of students faced, such as class of 1920 graduating at the end of a pandemic, the class of 1970 graduating in the middle of Vietnam War in 1970 and the class of 2001 graduating few months before the 9/11 attacks, Pichai asked the students to be hopeful. “Be open, be impatient, be hopeful. If you can do that, history will remember the Class of 2020 not for what you lost, but for what you changed. You have the chance to change everything. I am optimistic you will.” “...and in all cases, they prevailed. The long arc of history tells us we have every reason to be hopeful. So, be hopeful,” he said.The India-born Alphabet CEO drew from his personal experience and the challenges he faced in his early years in the US. He said that he grew up without much access to technology and his first time on a plane was when he came to Stanford for higher education. “My father spent the equivalent of a year’s salary on my plane ticket to the US so I could attend Stanford. It was my first time ever on a plane,” Pichai said adding that a bright spot for him during that time was computing. “The only thing that got me from here to there—other than luck—was a deep passion for technology, and an open mind,” he added. The graduation ceremony, streamed on You Tube, was attended by former US President Barack Obama and former First Lady Michelle Obama, Korean pop group BTS, singers Beyoncé and Lady Gaga, former Defense Secretary Robert M Gates, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and activist Malala Yousafzai.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/be-open-be-hopeful-google-ceo-sundar-pichai-s-mantra-for-class-of-2020/story-0PoFSI539wahls1gKjYd3N.html
09-06-2020||World||South Korean court rejects arrest of Samsung’s Lee in succession probe||A South Korean court rejected prosecutors’ request to arrest Samsung Group’s billionaire heir Jay Y Lee on allegations of price manipulation and violations of auditing rules, resolving a major uncertainty hanging over the world’s largest technology manufacturer.The Seoul Central District Court ruled against an arrest warrant for Lee and two other former Samsung executives Monday, saying that despite considerable evidence obtained through their investigation, they didn’t have a valid reason to detain Lee.”The relevance of the basic facts has been explained and it seems prosecutors have secured a considerable amount of evidence through their probes,” said Won Jung-sook, the judge in the case. “However, they had an insufficient explanation of the need to detain suspects.”Samsung Electronics Co. shares rose by as much as 2.9% in early Seoul trading on Tuesday.The ruling marks a victory for the co-vice chairman of the company, who’s embroiled in an increasingly contentious dispute with South Korean prosecutors over allegations of bribery and corruption. The request for an arrest warrant stemmed from a legal clash that dates back to 2015, centering on whether Lee and Samsung used illegal means to help him take control of a conglomerate founded by his grandfather.Prosecutors have been looking into alleged accounting fraud at Samsung Biologics Co. and a controversial 2015 merger of two Samsung affiliates, part of a broader probe into Lee’s succession plans. Investigators accuse Samsung of orchestrating a scheme to manipulate the value of Cheil Industries and Samsung C&T during the transaction, which they say helped the heir solidify his control of the conglomerate.”Given the seriousness of the case and a trove of evidence, the court’s decision to reject is a shame,” the prosecutors’ office said in a statement, as reported by Yonhap News. “Regardless of the result, we will do our best to continue the investigation according to law and principle going forward.”Why Samsung’s Billionaire Scion Is Facing Jail Again: QuickTakeThe failed arrest attempt is a relief for Samsung, which last week requested an outside review panel to assess the validity of a potential indictment of Lee by prosecutors, as allowed under Korean rules. If the panel is formed, it will make an assessment and give recommendations to prosecutors in coming months.Lee’s lawyers said in an emailed statement that they expect an impartial discussion of the case through the panel review. The Seoul Central Prosecutors Office said it will discuss Samsung’s request for the panel this Thursday, according to Yonhap.Tensions between South Korea’s largest conglomerate and prosecutors may intensify in coming weeks as both sides strive to win public opinion. Lee spent a year in prison from February 2017, when special prosecutors detained him over allegations that he bribed a confidante of former president Park Geun-hye.Samsung -- the world’s largest producer of memory chips, displays and smartphones -- has continued business as normal during the years-long probe and investors have been mostly unfazed. Its shares soared during 2019 and into the first months of 2020 before the coronavirus pandemic, despite prosecutorial scrutiny and investigations into more than a hundred group officials. But Lee’s plight remains a greater concern for Samsung because his potential absence would render it more difficult to make major decisions, such as on mergers and acquisitions or extraordinary investments.Samsung is fighting not just for Lee’s liberty, but for its corporate reputation. The allegations that it used gifts to buy government favor so one of the country’s richest men could take over his family’s company are so explosive they inflamed public opinion against major South Korean companies and shook the political balance of the nation.Samsung and Lee are determined to clear their names. The scion made a rare, personal apology in May, admitting missteps in the past and pledging not to hand leadership of the group to his children. Samsung has also been visibly active in helping South Korea’s battle against the coronavirus, dispatching its own doctors to help in the fight and helping to ramp up production of testing kits.Read more: Samsung Billionaire’s Fate at Risk Despite Role in Virus FightA day after prosecutors sought an arrest warrant last Thursday, Samsung strongly denied allegations of Lee’s involvement in stock price manipulations during the 2015 merger. The statement came after media reported that prosecutors concluded Samsung deliberately boosted stock prices of Cheil by purchasing treasury shares, while lowering Samsung C&T’s stock price through delaying announcement of an overseas construction deal. Samsung said there were no illegal attempts at manipulation.Fresh tensions between prosecutors and Samsung erupted in 2020 as the 51-year-old billionaire faced a new indictment over his involvement in succession plans, while a separate but related bribery trial involving the former administration remains in deadlock. Prosecutors have argued that one judge involved is biased and inclined to go lightly on Lee. The Supreme Court now needs to decide whether to keep the judge involved or replace him, which could mean the trial would drag into next year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sout-korean-court-rejects-arrest-of-samsung-s-lee-in-succession-probe/story-uUIBvHOxE3V8oqR1K8wHKM.html
09-06-2020||World||PM Boris Johnson to set out further lockdown easing as UK deaths fall||Prime Minister Boris Johnson will talk his cabinet through his plans for easing the UK’s lockdown on Tuesday after officials reported the lowest number of daily deaths since restrictions were imposed.The prime minister said last month that non-essential retailers would be able to reopen on June 15 if the threat of the virus continued to recede, and Health Secretary Matt Hancock said Monday’s positive data means the government can press on with its plans.“Coronavirus is in retreat across the land,” Hancock told the House of Commons as he reported 55 fatalities, the lowest daily number since March 22. “Those downward trends mean that we can proceed with our plans, but we do so putting caution and safety first.”Johnson, who is battling plunging poll ratings as he seeks to navigate a route to reopen the British economy while avoiding a second spike in infections, has been under pressure to accelerate the removal of restrictions that closed stores and businesses and stopped people spending time with their families and friends.Lawmakers from his Conservative Party added to the demands as they called for the two-meter social distancing limit to be halved to help the beleaguered hospitality industry. Pubs and restaurants are working toward July 4 for the limited reopening of outdoor areas but say many will be unviable if customers still have to stay two meters apart.Policies, ReviewCutting the distance “is the only way that we are going to save millions of jobs in hospitality over the next few months,” former cabinet minister Theresa Villiers told the House of Commons on Monday. Graham Brady, chairman of the influential 1922 committee of rank-and-filed Tory lawmakers, said the current limit needs to be reviewed.Spain and Canada have joined the UK in adopting the two-meter limit, but the World Health Organization recommends people should stay only a meter apart, the distance favored by China and France. Denmark cut its limit to one meter from two on May 10.Hancock said the advice from the UK’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies is clear that the closer people are, the more likely they are to spread the virus and any change to the distance would have to be seen “in the round” with other restrictions.“We keep the two-meter rule under review all of the time and Sage have been doing some work on this recently,” Hancock told the daily virus briefing later Monday. “But ultimately it isn’t the rule that’s the challenge to the opening of hospitality in a safe way, it’s the virus, and we have to find ways to be able to reopen the economy in a way that doesn’t lead to the increased spread of the virus.”‘Peacefully, Lawfully’Johnson linked the pandemic to the Black Lives Matter protests as he urged people involved to keep their distance from each other in a video message on Monday evening. The feelings of injustice at the heart of the movement are based in “cold reality,” he said, but they shouldn’t drive people to act in ways that will lead to a resurgence of the disease.He condemned the violence of some protesters and damage to property, including the toppling of a statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol, southwest England, but said work needs to be done to tackle prejudice and promote equality in Britain.“To all those who have chosen to protest peacefully and who have insisted on social distancing, I say, yes of course I hear you, and I understand,” Johnson said. “Let’s work peacefully, lawfully, to defeat racism and discrimination wherever we find it, and let us continue to work together across all the communities of this country as we put Britain back on its feet.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-boris-johnson-to-set-out-further-lockdown-easing-as-uk-deaths-fall/story-6GeraGSIumBln7kmtg5fZI.html
09-06-2020||World||England launches study of coronavirus spread in schools||Health minister Matt Hancock launched a study to find out the prevalence and spread of the coronavirus among school children and teachers in England on Tuesday to help inform the phased reintroduction of education after a lengthy national lockdown.The decision to gradually re-open schools has divided opinion, with Britain suffering the second-worst international death toll from Covid-19 and ministers warning of the need for caution to prevent a second wave of the virus.The study will look to establish how widespread the virus is among children, who typically show mild symptoms or no symptoms at all, and how effectively they transmit the disease.“This study will help us better understand how common asymptomatic and mild cases of Covid-19 are so that we can support parents, pupils and teachers and support-staff, and inform our ongoing response to this new virus,” Hancock said in a statement.Selected age groups have been able to attend schools since the beginning of the month, although some educators decided not to re-open because they said it was not safe. Older students will also begin some schooling from June 15.The voluntary study will be administered by the Public Health England agency and will collect data from around 200 staff and pupils at up to 100 English schools.Researchers will use both swab tests - which check whether a person currently has the virus - and blood tests, which check whether the person has previously had the virus and developed antibodies to it.Data will also be fed into wider government programmes designed to establish how widespread Covid-19 is, and has been, throughout the community in order to help form policy and develop new tests and treatments.

09-06-2020||World||With just 332 Covid-19 cases, why Vietnam’s richest man is making ventilators||The coronavirus pandemic largely leapfrogged Vietnam—the country has reported just 332 cases and no deaths—but from his sprawling headquarters in Hanoi, billionaire Pham Nhat Vuong could see a need beyond the border. In April, the country’s richest man surveyed his cradle-to-grave conglomerate and made a decision. He was getting into ventilators.In the worst cases of Covid-19, the virus attacks the lungs, making it harder to get oxygen to the bloodstream. A ventilator can be the difference between life and death, and there aren’t enough of them. By one estimate, the world’s hospitals could use another 800,000.The shortage is most acute in the developing world—South Sudan, for example, has just four ventilators for a population of 12 million—but the world’s richest country is short, too. After reports that some hard-hit New York City hospitals had jury-rigged ventilators to serve two patients at the same time, President Donald Trump compelled automakers and other U.S. companies to start making the devices. Ford Motor Co. and General Electric Co. teamed up to deliver 50,000 ventilators by July 13 in a $336 million government contract.Vuong believes his company, Vingroup JSC, can do it faster and for less money. Using an open-source design from device maker Medtronic Plc, Vingroup submitted a working ventilator for regulator approval in mid-April. While the company waits for Vietnam’s regulators to give the go-ahead, ventilators are rolling off the assembly line.Vingroup’s ventilators cost around $7,000 in Vietnam, 30% less than Medtronic’s own model. The company also says it could produce as many as 55,000 a month as soon as the government approves them and plans to export them wherever there’s demand. Vingroup says it’ll donate several thousand to Ukraine and Russia, where Vuong has long-standing business ties.“For the time being, we will focus on producing lots of ventilators—and doing it really well,” said the 51-year-old Vuong, who shared his plans over the course of a few months in a rare interview at Vingroup’s Hanoi headquarters and in a series of emails. “We want to join hands with the Vietnamese government to solve a part of the pandemic problem.”While Vingroup runs a handful of hospitals and clinics, being a medical device manufacturer hadn’t been on the agenda. But Vuong, who first got rich selling packaged noodles in Ukraine, is known for an ambition that dovetails Vietnam’s own. So when the country pushed domestic manufacturers to make more sophisticated products, Vingroup started making cars and smartphones. Now, as the government gives away cases of made-in-Vietnam face masks to virus-hit countries overseas, Vuong is making ventilators part of an even more ambitious global campaign: selling Vietnamese cars to the world. In December, he announced that VinFast, the conglomerate’s automotive group, would develop an electric vehicle and export it to the U.S. by 2021. Vuong is pledging $2 billion of his own fortune to make the improbable feat happen.Whether Americans would consider a Vietnamese car remains an open question. Ventilators, on the other hand, are a product the virus-stricken world can’t turn down. “The lesson we learn from a crisis is that there will always be lots of opportunities,” said Vuong. “We have to make the right choices and act fast.”Over the past two decades, Vietnam has become one of the world’s fastest-growing economies. Average annual incomes have grown more than sixfold, and even pre-pandemic, Vuong fixated on building a company fast enough to keep up with the country’s growing middle class. Today the Vingroup umbrella covers dozens of businesses that touch Vietnamese from childhood through senescence.A baby can be born in a Vinmec hospital, grow up in a Vinhome, attend a Vinschool and go on to VinUniversity. A family might drive a VinFast car through a community designed by Vingroup’s master planners en route to a vacation at a Vinpearl resort. In their everyday lives, they can talk on VinSmart phones and shop for international brands at Vincom malls.For Vietnam’s leaders, Vuong and Vingroup are a testament to the country’s progression from a socialist economy to a market-oriented one. The government has applauded Vingroup’s growth and success as part of Vietnam’s modernization. When VinFast’s first car rolled off the assembly line, Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc declared it “a great day for Vietnam.”What Vuong and Vietnam’s top leaders crave is international recognition, particularly in the U.S., the country’s onetime enemy and the world’s biggest economy. Many Americans, Vuong acknowledges, still see Vietnam as a “poor, backward country where it’s impossible to have modern and high-tech products.” The successful global introduction of a Vingroup product—whether it’s a car or a ventilator—could change the way the world sees Vietnam.“We want the company to tackle things that people think are relatively difficult, things that Vietnamese private enterprises have not done successfully,” he said. “It’s our mission and responsibility to develop a Vietnamese brand with a world-class reputation.”Ventilators may prove a strategic introduction to the global market. If Vingroup can pull off production at the scale Vuong’s anticipating, it will be addressing a worldwide shortage, leveraging on Medtronic’s brand as a well-established medical device maker. And if the ventilators work the way they’re supposed to, Vingroup will have proven its ability to deliver a complicated, reliable, life-saving device—not a bad bona fide for an aspiring carmaker.The company configured its first ventilator assembly line in less than a month, customizing three rows of conveyor belts in its seven-month-old smartphone factory. Engineers from the company’s VinFast car unit worked on the design of the device, and representatives from Medtronic are advising workers who were making smartphones and TV panels a few weeks ago.“There are very few companies in the world like it,” said Mark Mobius, founder of Mobius Capital Partners LLP. He’s been investing in Vietnam for the past decade and has private equity investments in the nation. “The ambition is astounding. It would be a huge win—to make Vietnam a global player.”Vuong says his plans for global expansion have only been emboldened by current events. Vingroup still anticipates hiring a few hundred engineers to expand the research and design center in Australia that will develop VinFast’s next car models and EVs. The company is reportedly interested in acquiring some assets of the soon-to-be-defunct Australian automaker Holden.“He seems to be zigging when other EV startups are zagging,” said Michael Dunne, chief executive officer of automotive consultant ZoZo Go, which focuses on the Asian market. “He has sky-high ambitions. But then there are reality checks.”Vuong has echoes of another automotive titan, Dunne says: Li Shu Fu, head of China’s biggest private carmaker Geely Automotive Holdings Ltd. Best known for acquiring Volvo from Ford in 2010, Li has become the dominant force in China’s car market. And, like Vuong, he’s declared his American ambitions. In 2006, he announced plans for Geely to export cars to the U.S. More than a decade later, neither Geely nor any other Chinese car brand has done so. Vuong has steered the company through rough times before. In 2011, as Vietnam’s inflation spiked to a region high of 23% and the real estate market tanked, the company’s real estate unit debuted its first master-planned community, featuring luxury villas along a man-made canal. The company’s consolidated net income fell 64% that year. It merged its real estate and tourism units to form Vingroup.The merger worked. Net revenue reached a record in 2012 and profits rebounded.  Since then, revenue has grown seventeen-fold, hitting 130.8 trillion dong ($5.6 billion) in 2019. Last year, the company restructured, abandoning early plans for an airline and selling off most of its grocery stores unit as well as its agriculture business.“The ongoing businesses now are the ones with the biggest potential. We won’t change our business strategy,” said Vuong. “If the global recession is severe, we can adjust some of our short-term plans.”Vuong has the confidence of someone who’s grown very rich reading and shaping consumer desires. In his earliest success, he sold Vietnamese instant soup noodles in Ukraine, where he settled after a college scholarship took him to Moscow. To convince a population raised on borscht and dumplings to love just-add-water soup, he hit the malls, did cooking demonstrations and gave away hundreds of free samples.“At the end of the day, we convinced the Ukrainian consumer,” said Vuong. The business became a household staple in the Eastern European state, and Nestle SA eventually acquired it for an estimated $150 million.In 2000, Vuong returned to Vietnam with his noodle profits and found nothing but opportunity. “The infrastructure was too outdated compared to the world. Hanoi only had a few high-rise buildings and five-star hotels,” he said. “I had the money. If I invested and couldn’t earn anything back, my thought was, at least the city would have big, nice buildings.”Within three years, he opened Vietnam’s first upscale hotel, the Vinpearl Resort & Spa on Hon Tre Island, connected by a two-mile gondola to the seaside city of Nha Trang. The grounds include Vietnam’s first water park and an 18-hole golf course.He started a real estate company — later merged to become Vingroup — and began building modern condominiums with supermarkets, schools and malls. Last year, the residential real estate arm sold 10,000 apartments in 17 days at its Vinhomes Grand Park, a canyon of riverside residential towers in the commercial hub of Ho Chi Minh City. The development encircles Landmark 81, Vietnam’s tallest skyscraper, also a Vingroup property.Vuong announced his plans to build and sell cars in September, 2017. Nine months later, he debuted his plans for a smartphone unit, VinSmart. The breadth of ambition and speed of execution has staggered observers and, often, partners.“If you work with them, it’s on their terms,” says Stephen Wyatt, Vietnam country head of Jones Lang LaSalle Inc., which worked on the valuation for Vinhomes ahead of its 2018 initial public offering. “It needs to be turned around in a very short space of time, whatever the scope may be. I have had calls in the middle of the night from them if they are waiting for a report or if something hasn’t been delivered.”VinFast introduced three new combustion vehicles last year and says it received more than 17,000 orders. In November, it plans to debut its first electric vehicle, a crossover SUV, at the Los Angeles Auto Show in November. The batteries, built with cells from LG Chem, give the car a 500 kilometer (310 mile) range on a single charge, about 15% less than Tesla’s Model S. Meanwhile, local media have spotted another VinFast EV prototype, a two-door coupe, on the streets of Hanoi. The company says it plans to test them widely this winter and start selling them by the summer.Vingroup’s plan to export electric vehicles to the U.S. in 2021 or 2022 is “not realistic,” said Dunne. U.S. safety, environmental and regulatory approvals typically take at least two to three years, and it’s not clear whether Vingroup’s begun the process. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency declined to comment on whether the company has filed any of the necessary paperwork.There are more questions, all with potentially expensive answers. Tesla Inc., which leads the American pack of electric carmakers, has yet to make an annual net profit. A slew of Chinese EV startups were “also caught in the same circumstances,” said Dunne. “You just don’t step into the U.S. market and do it quickly.”Global ratings agencies have their own doubts. Last fall, both S&P Global Ratings and Fitch Ratings changed their outlook on Vingroup to negative, citing concerns that the conglomerate relies on its cash-rich property unit—which makes up the bulk of Vingroup’s profit—to fund its new ventures. The company carried 291 trillion dong ($12.5 billion) in debt in the first quarter, up 37% from a year ago.Others ask whether Vingroup may grow too big to fail, so entrenched in Vietnam’s economy that the government and banking institutions would have to bail it out to prevent a collapse. Vingroup units have a combined market value of about $28 billion, or about 16% of the total value of the country’s publicly traded companies. As the company’s sales dropped by about one-third through the first quarter of 2020, they dragged both Vingroup shares and the broader market down too.“There’s a moral hazard if they believe they make such a key contribution that they take on more and more risks, thinking the government will help them out,” said Le Hong Hiep, an expert on Vietnam’s economy and politics at think tank ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore. “That’s a common problem with other national champions in Asia. If Vingroup collapses, it will be the government and the whole country that will also pay a heavy price.”Vuong doesn’t deny the risk, saying “any company can collapse.’’ He says the conglomerate has run contingency scenarios in case of a real estate meltdown like the one in 2009 and continues to plan for divestments across the group. So far, the property market is expected to grow slightly this year, with Vingroup also now developing industrial parks that are expected to be in demand as manufacturers move into Vietnam from China.And to those who doubt his EV ambitions, Vuong pointed out that VinFast turned a swamp into a state-of-the-art automotive factory, complete with fully-automated robotic production lines, and delivered a car in 21 months—another feat few thought was attainable until it happened.For now, the phone factory will redeploy some of the same metals, plastics and silicon semiconductors to make ventilators. About 70% of the materials are sourced locally, Vingroup says, and it can tap an already vast supply chain. Just 85 workers are producing an initial 160 ventilators a day as the company awaits final approval from the government to ramp up manufacturing.Vingroup’s two ventilator models have met initial technical standards, and clinical trials are under way, according to Nguyen Minh Tuan, who heads the department at the health ministry that’s regulating the ventilators. He said Vingroup should get approval to mass produce the ventilators once the results of the clinical trials come in this month.Vuong says the current price of the ventilators is less than what it costs to make them. “The purpose of ventilator production is completely about contributing to society at this critical time,” he says. It’s also temporary. “We have no plans to expand into this segment.”Vuong identifies as a patriot above all else, and he says he wants his company to keep adding to the list of firsts for Vietnam. “I always tell my colleagues: don’t let your life pass by without meaning,’’ he said. “Don’t let it be that at the end of your life, you have nothing that’s worth remembering or retelling. It would be a miserable ending to see that your life didn’t add any value.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-just-332-covid-19-cases-why-vietnam-s-richest-man-is-making-ventilators/story-G0UME5sRHMgc9OJiTrYMgI.html
09-06-2020||World||Covid-19: First time in 75 years, world leaders won’t gather at UN||The president of the UN General Assembly said Monday that world leaders will not be coming to New York for their annual gathering in late September for the first time in the 75-year history of the United Nations because of the Covid-19 pandemic.But Tijjani Muhammad-Bande told a news conference that he hopes to announce in the next two weeks how the 193 heads of state and government will give their speeches on pressing local and world issues during the assembly’s so-called General Debate.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“World leaders cannot come to New York because they cannot come simply as individuals,” he said. “A president doesn’t travel alone, leaders don’t travel alone” and “it is impossible” to bring large delegations to New York during the pandemic.“We cannot have them in person as we used to — what happened in the last 74 years — but it will happen” Muhammad-Bande said of the annual event.Secretary-General Antonio Guterres recommended last month that the gathering of world leaders, which was supposed to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations, be dramatically scaled back because of the pandemic.Guterres suggested in a letter to the General Assembly president that heads of state and government deliver prerecorded messages instead, with only one New York-based diplomat from each of the 193 UN member nations present in the assembly hall.Muhammad-Bande said Monday that by late September “maybe a hundred or so” people might be allowed in the General Assembly chamber.The meeting of world leaders usually brings thousands of government officials, diplomats and civil society representatives to New York for over a week of speeches, dinners, receptions, one-on-one meetings and hundreds of side events.This year was expected to bring an especially large number of leaders to UN headquarters to celebrate the founding of the United Nations in 1945 on the ashes of World War II.Muhammad-Bande said the 75th anniversary celebration “is not conceived as one moment” but will continue throughout the year starting on June 26, the 75th anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United Nations in San Francisco.He said a political declaration on the United Nations at 75 is also being negotiated, and world leaders will have the opportunity to mark the occasion — only not in person.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-first-time-in-75-years-world-leaders-won-t-gather-at-un/story-4Rau0fm8VQf0qnGRIi1KrM.html
09-06-2020||World||‘It just hurts’: Thousands mourn George Floyd in Texas amid calls for reform||The last chance for the public to say goodbye to George Floyd drew thousands of mourners Monday to a church in Houston where he grew up, as his death two weeks ago continues to stoke protests in America and beyond over racial injustice, and spurred France to abruptly halt the use of police choke holds.Reflecting the weight of the moment, the service drew the families of black victims in other high-profile killings whose names have become seared in America’s conversation over race — among them Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin.“It just hurts,” said Philonise Floyd, George Floyd’s brother, sobbing as he ticked off some of their names outside The Fountain of Praise church. “We will get justice. We will get it. We will not let this door close.”Under a blazing Texas sun, mourners wearing T-shirts with Floyd’s picture or the words “I Can’t Breathe” — the phrase he said repeatedly while pinned down by a Minneapolis police officer — waited for hours to pay their respects as Floyd’s body, dressed in a brown suit, lay in an open gold-coloured casket. Some sang “Lean on Me” and Houston’s police chief bumped fists and embraced others in line. Funeral home spokeswoman La’Torria Lemon said at least 6,000 attended the service.Some knew Floyd in the nearby housing projects where he grew up. Others travelled hours or drove in from other states. Those who couldn’t make it whipped up their own tributes: In Los Angeles, a funeral-style procession of cars inched through downtown as the viewing began in Houston. In Tennessee, residents of Memphis held a moment of silence.Bracy Burnett approached Floyd’s casket wearing a homemade denim face mask scrawled with “8:46″ — the length of time prosecutors say Floyd, who was black, was pinned to the ground under a white officer’s knee before he died.“All black people are not criminals. All white people are not racists. All cops are not bad. And ignorance comes in all colors. That’s what I thought about when I viewed the body,” Burnett, 66, said.Floyd’s death on May 25 has inspired international protests and drawn new attention to the treatment of African Americans in the U.S. by police and the criminal justice system.Hours into the viewing, a judge in Minneapolis kept bail at $1 million for Derek Chauvin, the police officer charged with second-degree murder in Floyd’s death. Chauvin, 44, said almost nothing during the 11-minute hearing while appearing on closed-circuit television from a maximum-security prison.Two weeks after Floyd’s death, the impact continued to resonate at home and abroad.In Paris, France’s top security official said police would no longer permit choke holds that have been blamed for multiple cases of asphyxiation and have come under renewed criticism after Floyd’s death.In Portland, Oregon, the city’s police chief resigned Monday, just six months into her job, amid criticism of her department’s handling of protests in Oregon’s largest city. An African American lieutenant on the force replaced her. The shakeup came as police have been sharply criticized for using what has been called inappropriate force against some protesters as huge demonstrations continue in Portland.“With this happening to him, it’s going to make a difference in the world,” said Pam Robinson, who grew up with Floyd and handed out bottled water to mourners waiting outside the church. The punishing heat spiked above 90 degrees and got to dozens in line, including one person who was taken to a hospital. Dozens more were helped to a cooling tent.Comill Adams said she drove more than seven hours from Oklahoma City with her family, including two children ages 8 and 10. They wore matching black T-shirts with “I Can’t Breathe” on the back — shirts she made up specially for the memorial.“We had been watching the protests on TV. We’ve been at home feeling outraged. At times it brought us to tears,” Adams said. “The fact this one is causing change, we had to come be a part of it.”Mourners were required to wear masks over fears of the coronavirus and stood 6 feet apart as they paused briefly to view the casket. On a stage behind the casket two identical murals showed Floyd wearing a black cap that read “Houston” and angel wings drawn behind him.Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott was among the first to view the casket, wearing a striped gold-and-crimson tie, the colors of Floyd’s Houston high school, where Floyd was a standout football player.“George Floyd is going to change the arc of the future of the United States. George Floyd has not died in vain. His life will be a living legacy about the way that America and Texas responds to this tragedy,” Abbott said.Floyd’s death has spurred calls for change nationwide.The Minneapolis City Council has vowed to dismantle the city’s 800-member police agency. And in Washington, House and Senate Democrats held a moment of silence at the Capitol’s Emancipation Hall before proposing legislative changes in policing oversight, reading Floyd’s name and those of others killed during police interactions and kneeling for 8 minutes and 46 seconds — now a symbol of police brutality.Besides banning police choke holds, the Justice in Policing Act would limit legal protections for police and create a national database of excessive-force incidents, according to an early draft. It is the most ambitious change to law enforcement sought by Congress in years.Meanwhile, officials nationwide are already taking steps to outlaw choke holds: California Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered the state’s police training program to stop teaching them and Denver police announced Sunday they were banning them, effective immediately.Floyd’s funeral will be Tuesday, followed by burial at the Houston Memorial Gardens cemetery in suburban Pearland, where he will be laid to rest next to his mother, Larcenia Floyd.Former Vice President Joe Biden met with Floyd’s family Monday, according to a photo posted on Twitter by the Rev. Al Sharpton. Biden will provide a video message for Floyd’s funeral service. Previous memorials have taken place in Minneapolis and Raeford, North Carolina, near where Floyd was born.Cities imposed curfews as several protests last week were marred by spasms of arson, assaults and smash-and-grab raids on businesses. More than 10,000 people have been arrested around the country, according to reports tracked by The Associated Press.But protests in recent days have been overwhelmingly peaceful — and over the weekend, several police departments appeared to retreat from aggressive tactics.Several cities have lifted curfews, including Chicago and New York City, where the governor urged protesters to get tested for the coronavirus as concerns have been raised that demonstrations could lead to an increase in virus cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-just-hurts-thousands-mourn-george-floyd-in-texas-amid-calls-for-reform/story-yMpywyBm2ySWdE2BDyqs0H.html
09-06-2020||World||North Korea to sever communication lines with ‘enemy’ South Korea: State media||North Korea said on Tuesday it will sever hotlines with South Korea as the first step toward shutting down all means of contact with Seoul, state news agency KCNA reported.For several days, North Korea has lashed out at South Korea, threatening to close an inter-Korean liaison office and other projects if the South does not stop defectors from sending leaflets and other material into the North. Top government officials in North Korea, including leader Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, and Kim Yong Chol, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea, determined “that the work towards the South should thoroughly turn into the one against an enemy,” KCNA said.As a first step, at noon on Tuesday, North Korea will close lines of communication at an inter-Korean liaison office, and hotlines between the two militaries and presidential offices, the report said.The official pronouncements mark a setback in relations amid efforts to try and persuade North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons programme in exchange for relief on tough international sanctions. The two Koreas remain technically at war because the 1950-1953 Korean War ended with an armistice rather than a peace treaty.“Regular communication channels are needed most during a crisis, and for that reason North Korea cuts them off to create an atmosphere of heightened risk,” Daniel Wertz, of the U.S.-based National Committee on North Korea, said on Twitter. “It’s a well-worn play for Pyongyang, but nonetheless a dangerous one.”The people of North Korea have “been angered by the treacherous and cunning behaviour of the South Korean authorities with whom we still have lots of accounts to settle,” KCNA said.The report accused South Korean authorities of irresponsibly allowing defectors to hurt the dignity of North Korea’s supreme leadership.“We have reached a conclusion that there is no need to sit face to face with the South Korean authorities and there is no issue to discuss with them, as they have only aroused our dismay,” KCNA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-it-will-sever-hotlines-with-enemy-south-korea-state-media/story-uo21Mxu28TlMoRAfHW4DNO.html

Critics say it should have been in place earlier, but home secretary Priti Patel defended its timing, saying it is needed to prevent another wave of coronavirus pandemic.British Airways’ owner, IAG, along with Ryanair and EasyJet, have sent a pre-legal action protocol letter to the government setting out why they believe the quarantine rules are illogical and unfair, that would allegedly prevent recovery in their industries.Ryanair chief executive Michael O’Leary warned that the rules will cause “untold devastation” for the tourism industry. He told BBC: “What it is going to do is untold devastation, not just to the airlines but to British tourism”. Under the rules, people arriving should drive their own car to their destination, where possible, and once there they must not use public transport or taxis. They must not go to work, school, or public areas, or have visitors - except for essential support. They are also not allowed to go out to buy food, or other essentials, where they can rely on others. Those arriving in England, Wales and Northern Ireland could face a fine of £1,000 if they fail to self-isolate for the full 14 days, while they face a £480 fine in Scotland. The maximum fine for repeat offenders in Scotland is £5,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airlines-sue-against-uk-quarantine-rules/story-8P4gnwcOBFNKHFPqEAaCFL.html
09-06-2020||World||George Floyd death: Minneapolis council vows to disband its police force||Minneapolis city council members have pledged to abolish its police force whose officer knelt on the neck of a dying George Floyd, as the biggest civil rights protests in more than 50 years demanded a transformation of US criminal justice.And Democrats, led by a group of African-American lawmakers, unveiled sweeping legislation on Monday to combat police violence and racial injustice. The 134-page bill would take numerous steps including allowing victims of misconduct to sue for police damages, ban chokeholds and require the use of body cameras by federal law enforcement officers, restrict the use of lethal force, and facilitate independent investigations of police departments with patterns of misconduct. The Democrats announced details of the legislation on Capitol Hill after kneeling for 8 minute and 46 seconds in Floyd’s memory — the exact time a white police officer had held the African-American down on the ground with a knee to his neck.  The move for the legislation, which may not pass given the lack of majority for Democrats in the Senate, came after a nine-member majority of the 13-member Minneapolis council on Sunday announced their decision to defund police force at a rally. They plan to replace the department with a community-based safety system and reallocate its budget to social programmes. “Our commitment is to end our city’s toxic relationship with the Minneapolis police department,” council president Lisa Bender said to loud cheers. She added they want to “end policing as we know it. ”President Donald Trump has been dismissive of the move. “LAW & ORDER, NOT DEFUND AND ABOLISH THE POLICE,” he tweeted on Monday. “The Radical Left Democrats have gone Crazy!”In New York, Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters he would shift some funds out of the city’s vast police budget and reallocate it to youth and social services.Demonstrations have swept the country slowly emerging from the coronavirus lockdown in the two weeks since Floyd, 46, died after choking out the words “I can’t breathe”. Derek Chauvin, the police officer due to appear in a Minneapolis court on Monday, has been charged with second-degree and third-degree murder as well as second-degree manslaughter.Huge weekend crowds had gathered across the country and in Europe to protest racism.  But slowly, normalcy is returning to the US. Curfews were removed in New York and other major cities including Philadelphia and Chicago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-minneapolis-council-vows-to-disband-its-police-force/story-OiHfqXqfJNg561qzuvQGZO.html
09-06-2020||World||Coronavirus pandemic is worsening globally, warns WHO chief||The head of the World Health Organization warned that the coronavirus pandemic is worsening globally, even as the situation in Europe is improving. At a press briefing on Monday, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that about 75% of cases reported to the UN health agency on Sunday came from 10 countries in the Americas and South Asia. He noted that more than 100,000 cases have been reported on nine of the past 10 days — and that the 136,000 cases reported Sunday was the biggest number so far. Tedros said most countries in Africa are still seeing an increase in cases, including in new geographic areas even though most countries on the continent have fewer than 1,000 cases. “At the same time, we’re encouraged that several countries around the world are seeing positive signs,” Tedros said. “In these countries, the biggest threat now is complacency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-pandemic-is-worsening-globally-warns-who-chief/story-WYcdQYZlP9D9Lllo7HbM8K.html
09-06-2020||World||Lockdown may have averted over 3 mn Covid-19 related deaths in Europe: Study||Wide-scale lockdowns including shop and school closures have reduced Covid-19 transmission rates in Europe enough to control its spread and may have averted more than three million deaths, researchers said on Monday. In a modelling study of lockdown impact in 11 nations, Imperial College London scientists said the draconian steps, imposed mostly in March, had “a substantial effect” and helped bring the infection’s reproductive rate below one by early May.The reproduction rate, or R value, measures the average number of people that one infected person will pass the disease on to. An R value above 1 can lead to exponential growth. The Imperial team estimated that by early May, between 12 and 15 million people in the 11 countries - Austria, Belgium, Britain, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Norway, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland - had been infected with Covid-19.By comparing the number of deaths counted with deaths predicted by their model if no lockdown measures had been introduced, they found some 3.1 million deaths were averted.“Measuring the effectiveness of these interventions is important, given their economic and social impacts, and may indicate which course of action is needed to maintain control,” the researchers said in a summary of their findings. A second study by scientists in the United States, published alongside the Imperial-led one in the journal Nature, estimated that anti-contagion lockdown policies implemented in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France and the United States prevented or delayed around 530 million Covid-19 cases.Focusing their analysis on these six countries, the US research team compared infection growth rates before and after the implementation of more than 1,700 local, regional and national policies designed to slow or halt the spread of Covid-19, the disease caused by the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.They found that without anti-contagion policies in place, early infection rates of SARS-CoV-2 grew by 68% a day in Iran and an average of 38% a day across the other five countries. Using econometric modelling normally used in assessing economic policies, they found lockdowns had slowed the infection rate with “measurable beneficial health outcomes in most cases”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lockdown-may-have-averted-over-3-mn-covid-19-related-deaths-in-europe-study/story-i8V2Ex1paKVI1EoRgi9WvN.html
09-06-2020||World||Black business owners’ ranks collapse by 41% in US amid Covid-19 lockdown, says study||The Covid-19 economic shutdown has hurt African American businesses the most among racial and ethnic groups in US, with a 41% decline of black owners from February to April, a new study from the National Bureau of Economic Research shows.While the pandemic has hit entrepreneurs across the board, closing some 3.3 million small businesses at least temporarily, the sidelining of 440,000 African Americans was especially severe. Black owners may have fared worse because fewer of them operated in industries deemed “essential” during the pandemic, among other factors, according to the NBER paper. Immigrant business owners also fared poorly, with a 36% drop during the period.“The negative early-stage impacts on minority- and immigrant-owned businesses, if prolonged, may be problematic for broader racial inequality because of the importance of minority businesses for local job creation, economic advancement, and longer-term wealth inequality,” said the report’s author, Robert Fairlie of the University of California at Santa Cruz.The findings add to other data showing that the pandemic has broadly hit African Americans harder than other groups, with blacks suffering higher rates of mortality from the coronavirus and greater joblessness. While unemployment among white Americans fell to 12.4% last month, according to data released Friday by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the jobless rate for African Americans rose slightly to 16.8%. The disparities put a stark spotlight on racial inequalities as protests continue nationwide in the wake of the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis.Here’s a look at the main racial and demographic groups in the NBER paper:The NBER’s study evaluated data from a federal government population survey to estimate the number small business owners that had ceased operating from pre-pandemic February to April, the first full month of Covid-19 related lockdowns. The report makes no assumptions about whether the owners will be shuttered only temporarily or permanently, and it notes certain government relief efforts that could help keep small businesses afloat, especially the $669 billion Paycheck Protection Program.The study doesn’t capture most of the second tranche of funding in the PPP program, which started at the end of April and reached many small firms that were shut out in the first round. A new bill signed last week gives small businesses more flexibility in how they can use the PPP loans, which can be converted into grants as long as owners follow program guidelines. Among other changes, it extends the period in which businesses can use the funds and still seek loan forgiveness to 24 weeks from eight weeks.Overall, the number of operating business owners of all groups fell to 11.7 million in April from 15 million two months earlier, a 22% decline that Fairlie calls “unprecedented.” Aside from blacks and immigrants, Hispanic small business owners also fared poorly, with a 32% decline over the period, while Asians and females saw drops of 26% and 25%, respectively.The number of businesses owned by white men or women fell 17%, the study says.Among industries, the only sector that didn’t suffer a decline in small business owners was agriculture, which saw a 7% uptick. Hard-hit industries include arts, leisure and hotels, which fell by 35%, and construction, down by 27%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-business-owners-ranks-collapse-by-41-in-us-amid-covid-19-lockdown-says-study/story-qaM9tdrnBmdKy7bnrTm58M.html

09-06-2020||World||Minneapolis council backs dismantling police force over George Floyd’s death||A majority of the members of the Minneapolis City Council said Sunday they support disbanding the city’s police department, an aggressive stance that comes just as the state has launched a civil rights investigation after George Floyd’s death.Nine of the council’s 12 members appeared with activists at a rally in a city park Sunday afternoon and vowed to end policing as the city currently knows it. Council member Jeremiah Ellison promised that the council would “dismantle” the department.“It is clear that our system of policing is not keeping our communities safe,” Lisa Bender, the council president, said. “Our efforts at incremental reform have failed, period.”Bender went on to say she and the eight other council members that joined the rally are committed to ending the city’s relationship with the police force and “to end policing as we know it and recreate systems that actually keep us safe.”Floyd, a handcuffed black man, died May 25 after a white officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck, ignoring his “I can’t breathe” cries and holding it there even after Floyd stopped moving. His death sparked protests — some violent, many peaceful — that spread nationwide.Community activists have criticized the Minneapolis department for years for what they say is a racist and brutal culture that resists change. The state of Minnesota launched a civil rights investigation of the department last week, and the first concrete changes came Friday in a stipulated agreement in which the city agreed to ban chokeholds and neck restraints.A more complete remaking of the department is likely to unfold in coming months.Disbanding an entire department has happened before. In 2012, with crime rampant in Camden, New Jersey, the city disbanded its police department and replaced it with a new force that covered Camden County. Compton, California, took the same step in 2000, shifting its policing to Los Angeles County.It was a step that then-Attorney General Eric Holder said the Justice Department was considering for Ferguson, Missouri, after the death of Michael Brown. The city eventually reached an agreement short of that but one that required massive reforms overseen by a court-appointed mediator.The move to defund or abolish the Minneapolis department is far from assured, with the civil rights investigation likely to unfold over the next several months.On Saturday, activists for defunding the department staged a protest outside Mayor Jacob Frey’s home. Frey came out to talk with them.“I have been coming to grips with my own responsibility, my own failure in this,” Frey said. When pressed on whether he supported their demands, Frey said: “I do not support the full abolition of the police department.”He left to booing.At another march Saturday during which leaders called for defunding the department, Verbena Dempster said she supported the idea.“I think, honestly, we’re too far past” the chance for reform, Dempster told Minnesota Public Radio. “We just have to take down the whole system.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minneapolis-council-majority-backs-disbanding-police-force-in-aftermath-of-george-floyd-s-death/story-LTvvdCQLx7byrboaNnf1jP.html
