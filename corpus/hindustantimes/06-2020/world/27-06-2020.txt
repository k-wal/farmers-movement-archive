They are “going to be asymptomatic, and people who are getting infected in a community setting, not an outbreak setting where you know who to identify, isolate and contact trace”, he said at the first briefing of the White House coronavirus task force in two months on Friday.The states worst affected by the surge are reviving restrictions that they had rushed to lift earlier, against the advise to public health. Texas, for instance, which saw another day of more than 5,000 new infections, has shut down bars and restaurants and certain outdoor activities.State’s governor Greg Abbott, a Republican, sounded contrite in an interview to a local TV station:“If I could go back and redo anything, it probably would have been to slow down the opening of bars, now seeing the aftermath of how quickly the coronavirus spreads in the bar setting.”Florida, another state in the eye of the new surge with a daily record of close to 9,000 news infections on Friday, has also brought back some restrictions. Bars are prohibited from serving alcohol now, its Republican governor, Ron DeSantis, a close ally of President Donald Trump, has resisted calls to do more.Different counties, however, are taking their own measures. Miami-Dade county has shut down beaches and public parks in view of the upcoming July 4 independence day weekend, and another county is mailing reusable masks to all its residents.The states of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, that were the hardest hit earlier, are continuing their reopening. Connecticut has become the first state to announce plans to resume in-school education in the fall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sees-record-covid-19-cases-in-a-day-officials-regret-reopening-move/story-h9OQCT4rWjVlyzLnO8oHFL.html
27-06-2020||World||Ireland gets coalition government, Leo Varadkar to return as PM in 2022||Leo Varadkar, the outgoing prime minister of Ireland, will now be the deputy prime minister under a new coalition government from Saturday headed by Micheal Martin, and return as the prime minister in 2022 under the power-sharing arrangement.Varadkar, 41, became a caretaker prime minister after no party won a majority in the February 8 election. The process of government formation was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Three parties have now agreed to form the coalition government.They are Varadkar’s Fine Gael party, Martin’s Fianna Fail (both centrist) and the Green party. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail, who have long been rivals since the Irish Civil War, are joining a coalition for the first time.Martin will be the prime minister (Taoiseach) for two and a half years, and will be replaced by Varadkar for the remaining period of the parliament from December 2022, reports from Dublin said.In London, Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: “Congratulations to Ireland on forming a new Government and to Micheal MartinTD on becoming Taoiseach”. “Ireland is our closest neighbour, good friend and ally on issues such as climate change, the global fight against Covid-19 and our shared values on human rights and democracy.”Under the coalition agreement, the new government will implement the Green party’s demand to set a target of 7 per cent to cut carbon emissions every year.Green party leader Eamon Ryan said: “There’s a sense of responsibility on us now because we do have a job to do. We have to go in and help work with our coalition partners in government in actually getting our country out of a really severe economic crisis”.“People at home who are losing their jobs or maybe risk of that, they want a government to get up and stand up for them and get everyone back working.”With a base in both Ireland and Northern Ireland (part of UK), Sinn Fein emerged as a major factor in the election, exploiting ennui in the country wracked by rising housing costs and the people not experiencing economic recovery in recent years, but is not part of the coalition.Sinn Fein was known as the political wing of the Irish Republican Army that was responsible for violence and terrorism for years in Northern Ireland and elsewhere, until peace returned with the Good Friday agreement of 1998.Sinn Fein seeks reunification of the island of Ireland, promising a referendum within five years. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have the same objective in the long-term, but do not favour the referendum soon enough.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-gets-coalition-government-leo-varadkar-to-return-as-pm-in-2022/story-j8zlpeJxG3Fa1KIWTnTXlN.html
27-06-2020||World||US slaps visa restrictions on Chinese officials over Hong Kong autonomy||The United States on Friday announced visa restrictions on current and former officials of the Chinese Communist Party, and their families, deemed responsible for undermining Honk Kong’s “high degree of autonomy” guaranteed by a Sino-British pact joint declaration from 1984.Secretary of State Mike Pompeo cited a proposed move by Beijing to “supervise” policing in Hong Kong under a new national security law and also intervene directly in some areas as the immediate provocation for the visa curbs. China’s parliament is expected to adopt the new law next week.Precise details of the law remain secret. But it is expected to make it a criminal offence to secede, subvert, support terrorism and collude with foreign governments, the BBC has reported in an explainer. Among other things, Beijing will have the authority to interpret the law when needed, not any local authority.Hong Kong enjoys freedoms and rights not extended to mainland Chinese, under the 1984 joint declaration that paved the way for the 1997 transfer of Hong Kong by the British, who had administered it since conquering it in 1840 after the Opium War. It’s a legally binding agreement under which China’s basic policies regarding China will remain unchanged for 50 years, and it included, among other things, that guarantee of a “high degree of autonomy”“The United States calls on China to honor its commitments and obligations in the Sino-British Joint Declaration – namely that Hong Kong will “enjoy a high degree of autonomy” and that human rights and fundamental freedoms, including the freedoms of expression and peaceful assembly, will be protected by law and respected by governing authorities in Hong Kong.,” Pompeo said in the announcement. “The United States will continue to review its authorities to respond to these concerns,’ he added.Tensions and rhetoric the United States and China have risen dramatically in the aftermath of the Covid-19 epidemic. The Trump administration has accused China of misleading the world about the disease and concealing its mistake and the exact magnitude of the epidemic. Negative views about China have shot up in polls of Americans and a spate of legislations are making their way through congress against China.Trump signed one of them into law last week that seeks to punish China with sanctions over its treatment of Uighur Muslims.The Chinese embassy in Washington denounced the visa restrictions as interference. “We urge the US side to immediately correct its mistakes, withdraw the decisions and stop interfering in China’s domestic affairs. The Chinese side will continue to take strong measures to uphold national sovereignty, security and development interests, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-slaps-visa-restrictions-on-chinese-officials-over-hong-kong-autonomy/story-fswZM9a5aadhnNb8Mo08jO.html
27-06-2020||World||Satellite image: Iran blast struck by suspected missile site||An explosion that rattled Iran’s capital came from an area in its eastern mountains that analysts believe hides an underground tunnel system and missile production sites, satellite photographs showed Saturday.What exploded in the incident early Friday that sent a massive fireball into the sky near Tehran remains unclear, as does the cause of the blast.The unusual response of the Iranian government in the aftermath of the explosion, however, underscores the sensitive nature of an area near where international inspectors believe the Islamic Republic conducted high-explosive tests two decades ago for nuclear weapon triggers.The blast shook homes, rattled windows and lit up the horizon early Friday in the Alborz Mountains. State TV later aired a segment from what it described as the site of the blast.One of its journalists stood in front of what appeared to be large, blackened gas cylinders, though the camera remained tightly focused and did not show anything else around the site. Defense Ministry spokesman Davood Abdi blamed the blast on a leaking gas he did not identify and said no one was killed in the explosion.Abdi described the site as a “public area,” raising the question of why military officials and not civilian firefighters would be in charge. The state TV report did not answer that.Satellite photos of the area, some 20 kilometers (12.5 miles) east of downtown Tehran, showed hundreds of meters (yards) of charred scrubland not seen in images of the area taken in the weeks ahead of the incident. The building near the char marks resembled the facility seen in the state TV footage.The gas storage area sits near what analysts describe as Iran’s Khojir missile facility. The explosion appears to have struck a facility for the Shahid Bakeri Industrial Group, which makes solid-propellant rockets, said Fabian Hinz, a researcher at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in Monterey, California.The Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies identified Khojir as the “site of numerous tunnels, some suspected of use for arms assembly.” Large industrial buildings at the site visible from satellite photographs also suggest missile assembly being conducted there.The U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency says Iran overall has the largest underground facility program in the Middle East.Such sites “support most facets of Tehran’s ballistic missile capabilities, including the operational force and the missile development and production program,” the DIA said in 2019.Iranian officials themselves also identified the site as being in Parchin, home to a military base where the International Atomic Energy Agency previously said it suspects Iran conducted tests of explosive triggers that could be used in nuclear weapons. Iran long has denied seeking nuclear weapons, though the IAEA previously said Iran had done work in “support of a possible military dimension to its nuclear program” that largely halted in late 2003.Western concerns over the Iranian atomic program led to sanctions and eventually to Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The U.S. under President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from the accord in May 2018, leading to a series of escalating attacks between Iran and the U.S. and Tehran abandoning the deal’s production limits.Iran’s missile and space programs have suffered a series of explosions in recent years. The most notable came in 2011, when a blast at a missile base near Tehran killed Revolutionary Guard commander Hassan Tehrani Moghaddam, who led the paramilitary force’s missile program, and 16 others. Initially, authorities described the blast as an accident, though a former prisoner later said the Guard interrogated him on suspicion Israel caused the explosion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/satellite-image-iran-blast-struck-by-suspected-missile-site/story-1tDJIwklngTJ44HTx8CSoO.html
27-06-2020||World||Why Americans are having an emotional reaction to masks||While Americans still have not adopted mask-wearing as a general norm, we’re wearing masks more than ever before. Mask-wearing is mandated in California, and in many counties masks are near-universal in public spaces. So I have started wondering: Does wearing a mask change our social behavior and our emotional inclinations? And if mask-wearing does indeed change the fabric of our interactions, is that one reason why the masks are not more popular in the U.S.?When no one can see our countenances, we may behave differently. One study found that children wearing Halloween masks were more likely to break the rules and take more candy. The anonymity conferred by masks may be making it easier for protestors to knock down so many statues.And indeed, people have long used masks to achieve a kind of plausible deniability. At Carnival festivities around the world people wear masks, and this seems to encourage greater revelry, drunkenness, and lewd behavior, traits also associated with masked balls. The mask creates another persona. You can act a little more outrageously, knowing that your town or village, a few days later, will regard that as “a different you.”If we look to popular culture, mask-wearing is again associated with a kind of transgression. Batman, Robin and the Lone Ranger wear masks, not just to keep their true identities a secret, but to enable their “ordinary selves” to step into these larger-than-life roles.But if we examine mask-wearing in the context of Covid-19, a different picture emerges. The mask is now a symbol of a particular kind of conformity, and a ritual of collective responsibility and discipline against the virus. The masks themselves might encourage this norm adherence by boosting the sense of group membership among the wearers.The public health benefits of mask-wearing far exceed the social costs, but still if we want mask-wearing to be a stable norm we may need to protect against or at least recognize some of its secondary consequences, including the disorientations that masks can produce. Because mask-wearing norms seem weakest in many of the most open societies, such as the United States and United Kingdom, perhaps it is time to come to terms how masks rewrite how we react and respond to each other.If nothing else, our smiles cannot be seen under our masks, and that makes social interactions feel more hostile and alienating, and it may lower immediate levels of trust in casual interactions. There are plenty of negative, hostile claims about masks circulating, to the point of seeming crazy, but rather than just mocking them perhaps we need to recognize what has long been called “the paranoid style in American politics.” If we admit that mask-wearing has a psychologically strange side, we might do better than simply to lecture the miscreants about their failings.Just ask yourself a simple question: If someone tells you there is a new movie or TV show out, and everyone in the drama is wearing masks, do you tend to think that’s a feel-good romantic comedy, or a scary movie? In essence, we are asking Americans to live in that scenario, but not quite giving them the psychological armor to do so successfully.On the brighter side, I wonder if mask-wearing might diminish some expressions of intolerance. People who might feel that others are “looking at them funny” might find themselves with less to be offended by as masks obscure those micro-reactions. Common mask-wearing is already reportedly easing the public judgment experienced by Muslim women who wear face coverings in Western society; some Muslim women who wear the niqab report that they are no longer being given dirty looks, if only because they no longer stick out so much.Women who cover their faces for religious reasons may now be ahead of the rest of us when it comes to effective communication — because they cannot rely as much their faces to convey emotion in public conversations, they report relying on more visible body language like waving and gesturing.The tension of current mask policy is that it reflects a desire for a more obedient, ordered society, for public health purposes above all, but at the same time it creates incentives and inclinations for non-conformity. That is true at least within the context of American culture, admittedly an outlier, both for its paranoia and for its infatuation with popular culture. As a society, our public mask-wearing is thus at war with its own emotional leanings, because it is packaging together a message based on both discipline and deviance.What can we do to convince people that a mask-laden society, while it will feel weird and indeed be weird, can be made stable and beneficial through our own self-awareness? While there is no simple answer to that question, mask advocates should recognize that they have been treading into unusual cultural territory, and should not be surprised by unusual public responses.(This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

27-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Indians in UK most dead among non-whites||Coronavirus patients of Indian origin top the list of patients who have succumbed to the virus among the non-white population in England, according to latest figures released by the National Health Service, as the UK prepares to ease lockdown further from July 4.NHS England figures show that 763 patients categorised as ‘Indian’ died as of June 25, followed by patients of ‘Caribbean’ heritage (636) and of ‘Pakistani’ origin (479). The ‘Indian’ category accounts for 3 per cent among the non-white patients who died due to contracting the virus.Together, the non-white patients categorised as BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) accounted for 3,794 deaths. Several reviews have concluded that the virus has affected the BAME communities ‘disproportionately’.Besides higher incidence of diseases such as diabetes among BAME communities, the reviews highlight the fact that individuals from such communities make up a large share of jobs considered essential in tackling the virus, many of which are public-facing. Several doctors and nurses of Indian heritage working in the NHS are among the dead. A report by Public Health England said: “Historic racism and poorer experiences of healthcare or at work may mean that individuals in BAME groups are less likely to seek care when needed or as NHS staff are less likely to speak up when they have concerns about Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) or risk.”Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) have showed that there is a “significantly higher” risk of death from the virus among Indian and other non-white communities than the white community.The ONS said Indian and other non-white males are 4.2 times more likely to die from a Covid-19-related death and non-white females are 4.3 times more likely than white ethnicity males and females. The UK’s Indian-origin population is estimated to number 1.5 million.The ONS said: “People of Bangladeshi and Pakistani, Indian, and Mixed ethnicities also had statistically significant raised risk of death involving Covid-19 compared with those of White ethnicity”.According to Kamlesh Khunti, medical expert at the University of Leicester, the reasons Indian and other non-white people figure more in the statistics, despite accounting for only 14 per cent of the UK population, include many coming from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, working in public-facing occupations, holding different cultural beliefs and behaviours or being at high risk of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-indians-in-uk-most-dead-among-non-whites/story-9VnyMIzeWOTJFS2lBcAj0O.html
27-06-2020||World||US states reimpose virus controls; India tops 500,000 cases||Reversing course, two of America’s largest states reinstated some coronavirus restrictions in the nation’s biggest retreat yet, as the daily number of confirmed infections in the U.S. surged to an all-time high of 45,300.India reported more than 18,000 new cases Saturday, pushing its cumulative total over the half-million mark, the fourth highest globally behind the U.S., Brazil and Russia. Elsewhere, Egypt and Britain said they would ease virus controls, while China and South Korea battled smaller outbreaks in their capitals.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott ordered all bars closed, and Florida banned alcohol at such establishments. They joined a small but growing number of states that are either backtracking or putting any further reopening of their economies on hold because of a comeback by the virus, mostly in the country’s South and West.Health experts have said a disturbingly large number of cases are being seen among young people who are going out again, often without wearing masks or observing other social-distancing rules.“It is clear that the rise in cases is largely driven by certain types of activities, including Texans congregating in bars,” Abbott said.The Republican governor, who had pursued one of the most aggressive reopening schedules of any state, also scaled back restaurant capacity and said outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people would need approval from local officials.Mayor Carlos Gimenez in Florida’s Miami-Dade County announced Friday night that he would close beaches over the Fourth of July weekend. He said cracking down on recreational activities is prudent given the growing number of infections among young adults.Stocks fell sharply on Wall Street on Friday over the surging case numbers. The Dow Jones Industrial Average shed 730 points, or nearly 3%.The Indian city of Gauhati, the capital of Assam state, will be locked down for two weeks starting Monday, with night curfews and weekend lockdowns in the rest of the state. India added 18,552 cases in the past 24 hours, raising its total to 508,953. The death toll reached 15,685.China saw an uptick in cases, one day after authorities said they expect an outbreak in Beijing to be brought under control in the near future. The National Health Commission reported 17 new cases in the nation’s capital, the most in a week, among 21 nationwide.South Korea, where a resurgence in the past month threatens to erase the country’s earlier success, reported 51 new cases, including 35 in the Seoul metropolitan area. Officials, worried about the fragile economy, have resisted calls to reimpose restrictions eased in April.Cairo’s cafes welcomed back in-house customers Saturday as Egypt reopened cafes, clubs, gyms and theaters after more than three months of closures. Wearing face masks, the faithful poured into mosques for dawn prayers, though mosques and churches are not yet allowed to hold their main weekly services.Britain was expected to scrap a 14-day quarantine requirement for people returning from abroad in a bid to make summer vacation travel possible. Only travelers from “red’’ zones, places with a high level of COVID-19, will be told to self-isolate. A full list of countries, due to be published next week, is likely to give Spain, Greece and France a green light.Australia braced for more imported cases as citizens return home. About 300 people were due to arrive this weekend from Mumbai, India, with others expected to follow from South America and Indonesia. One state heath official said he is preparing for 5% to 10% of the returnees to be infected, based on arrivals from Indonesia in other states.In Florida, the agency that regulates bars acted after the daily number of new confirmed cases neared 9,000, almost doubling the record set just two days earlier.Colleen Corbett, a 30-year-old bartender at two places in Tampa, said that she was disappointed and worried about being unemployed again, but that the restrictions are the right move. Most customers were not wearing masks, she said.“It was like they forgot there was a pandemic or just stopped caring,” Corbett said.A number of the hardest-hit states, including Florida and Arizona, have Republican governors who have resisted mask-wearing requirements and largely echoed President Donald Trump’s desire to reopen the economy quickly despite warnings that the virus could come storming back.The White House coronavirus task force, led by Vice President Mike Pence, held its first briefing in nearly two months Friday, and Pence gave assurances that the U.S. is “in a much better place” than it was two months ago.He said the country has more medical supplies on hand, a smaller share of patients are being hospitalized, and deaths are much lower than they were in the spring.The count of new confirmed infections, provided by Johns Hopkins University, eclipsed the previous high of 40,000 set the previous day. Newly reported cases per day have risen on average about 60% over the past two weeks, according to an Associated Press analysis.While the rise partly reflects expanded testing, experts say there is ample evidence the scourge is making a comeback, including rising deaths and hospitalizations in parts of the country and higher percentages of virus tests coming back positive.About 600 people are dying every day from the coronavirus in the U.S., down from a peak of around 2,200 in mid-April. Some experts doubt that deaths will return to that level, because of advances in treatment and prevention and because younger adults are more likely than older ones to survive.The virus is blamed for about 125,000 deaths and nearly 2.5 million confirmed infections nationwide, by Johns Hopkins’ count. But health officials believe the true number of infections is about 10 times higher. Worldwide, the virus has claimed close to a half-million lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-states-reimpose-virus-controls-india-tops-500-000-cases/story-Ha3e64KZPMjic5EHThEJyL.html
27-06-2020||World||Hong Kong police refuse permission for march to mark handover||The Hong Kong police department on Saturday denied permission for an annual march in the former British colony on July 1 to mark the anniversary of the city’s 1997 return to China, the organiser and the police said in separate statements.In a notice to the organiser, Civil Human Rights Front, the police cited the city’s current rules limiting gatherings to no more than 50 people due to the coronavirus pandemic, saying public assemblies and demonstrations are not exempted.The notice, posted on the front’s Facebook page, also cited violent incidents that took place after public assemblies and rallies organised by the group over the past 12 months.“Upon risk assessment, police considered that the public meetings and procession are high-risk activities,” the local police department said in a separate post on the department’s Facebook page. The move comes ahead of a three-day meeting from Sunday of China’s parliament, which is expected to enact new national security legislation on the eve of the 23rd anniversary of Hong Kong’s return to Chinese rule.China says the national security law, which has alarmed foreign governments and democracy activists, will target only a small group of troublemakers and people who abide by the legislation have no reason to worry.China took back control of Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, under a “one country, two systems” formula that allows freedoms not enjoyed in mainland China, including freedom of protest and a much-cherished independent judiciary.In recent years, the anniversary of the handover has been marked by deepening despondency about what many residents saw as increasing meddling by the mainland and the erosion of freedoms.On Friday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Washington was imposing visa restrictions on Chinese officials responsible for restricting freedoms in Hong Kong, but he did not name any of those targeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-refuse-permission-for-march-to-mark-handover/story-SMXIeWLQNOEnEuo6IdVKWK.html

China currently can offer 3.78 million nucleic acid tests for Covid-19 every day, a 200-percent increase from March, a health official said earlier this week.As of June 22, Chinese medical institutions had conducted 90.41 million nucleic acid tests for COVID-19 in total, said Guo Yanhong, an official with the NHC said.The total number of designated centers offering nucleic acid tests has increased from 2,081 in early March to the current 4,804, marking a 131-percent increase, Guo said, adding that 28,500 technicians are carrying out nucleic acid testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-issues-new-covid-19-guidelines-as-fresh-cases-inch-close-to-300/story-bkTKxKReyb8DsGTGFwR6KN.html
27-06-2020||World||Individuals have societal responsibility to end Covid-19 outbreak: Anthony Fauci||America’s top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said that individuals have a societal responsibility to end the coronavirus outbreak as the US set another single-day record, surpassing 40,000 Covid-19 cases for the first time. Fauci, during the first White House Coronavirus Task Force press conference in months, said that there’s no other infectious disease that goes from 40 per cent of the people having no symptoms to some having mild symptoms to some having severe, some requiring staying at home for weeks, some going to the hospital, some getting intensive care, some getting intubated, some getting ventilated and some dying. “I just want to bring this out without making it seem that anybody is at fault, you have an individual responsibility to yourself but you have a societal responsibility because if we want to end this outbreak, really end it and then hopefully when a vaccine comes and puts the nail in the coffin, we’ve got to realise that we are part of the process,” he said on Friday. Fauci, a member of the White House Coronavirus Task Force, said that “depending on where you are in that spectrum, you have a different attitude to this particular thing”. But anyone who gets infected or is at risk of getting infected to a greater or lesser degree is part of the dynamic process of the outbreak, he said. “I was at a stage in my life when I said well, I’m invulnerable, so I’m going to take a risk. I think what we are missing in this is something that we’ve never faced before is that a risk for you is not just isolated to you because if you get infected, you are part, innocently or inadvertently of propagating the dynamic process of a pandemic. “Because the chances are that if you get infected that you’re going to infect someone else. And although you may feel well and because we know if you look at the numbers that you’ll probably hear later on, the overwhelming majority now of people getting infected are young people, likely the people that you see in the clips and in the paper who are out in crowds enjoying themselves, understandably,” Fauci said. The reproduction element of the virus is not less than one, he said. “So people are infecting other people. And then ultimately, you will infect someone who’s vulnerable. Now, that may be somebody’s grandmother, grandfather, uncle who’s on chemotherapy and who’s on radiation or chemotherapy or a child who has leukemia,” the top American doctor said. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 9.8 million people and killed more than 494,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 2.46 million cases and more than 1,25,000 deaths. The Covid-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment. According to Vice President Mike Pence, more than 2,500,000 Americans have contracted the coronavirus and over 126,000 have died. All the 50 states and territories across this country are opening up safely and responsibly, but with the cases rising particularly over the past week, Trump directed the task force to brief the Americans. On Friday a record number of 40,000 new cases were reported. “Despite those losses since the end of our 45 days to slow the spread and the beginning of efforts to open up America thanks to the cooperation of the American people, the efforts of governors and state health officials, efforts I want to proudly say of the entire federal team under the leadership of President Trump, we have made truly remarkable progress in moving our nation forward,” Pence said.As the country opens up, more than three million jobs were created in the last job report, he said.“Retail sales are rolling and, of course, the extraordinary progress in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, and New Orleans, areas that just a matter of a month ago were struggling under the weight of this pandemic and that now have arrived at a very, very different place,” Pence added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/individuals-have-societal-responsibility-to-end-covid-19-outbreak-anthony-fauci/story-BPxpKn23GtF1bHPEKxJfEI.html

Police also recovered about 40,000 drug pills and locally made guns, he said.According to authorities and local media reports, the gang led by Abdul Hakim has kidnapped many locals for ransom and killed those whose families failed to pay. It had allegedly abducted at least seven Bangladeshis over the last two months and killed three hostages. Hakim remains at large.While human rights groups acknowledge there are criminal elements among some of the Rohingya refugees, they have urged authorities to thoroughly investigate such cases.In March, police fatally shot seven suspected members of a Rohingya gang allegedly involved in drug dealing and human trafficking.More than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims fled Myanmar into Bangladesh after the Buddhist-majority country’s military launched a crackdown against them in August 2017 in response to an attack by insurgents.(AP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-rohingya-men-killed-in-gunfight-with-bangladesh-police/story-a2Qhl0fUWWHVMQiR3Q7d0J.html

His close relationship with Prime Minister Narendra Modi – reflected in the two leaders jointly addressing massive public rallies in Houston and Ahmedabad – has helped him make deep inroads among the Indian-Americans.“He (Trump) recognises the vital role Indian-Americans play in bolstering our economy, enriching our culture, and strengthening our communities,” she said.During his first two years in office, President Trump led the US to its greatest economic comeback in history.“And the unemployment rate among Indian-Americans dropped by nearly 33 per cent,” Matthews said.The President continues to fight for the prosperity, health, and freedom of all Americans, including the flourishing and hardworking Indian-American community, she said, responding to a question related to the increasing popularity of Trump among the community.Al Mason said while the vision of Trump is the driving force in this unprecedented outreach with the Indian-Americans and a new peak in ties with India, the entire family including the First Lady Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, who have recently visited India with him, shown their immense respect and love for the country.Not to overlook son Donald Trump Jr and Kimberly Guilfoyle, senior advisor to Donald Trump for President, Inc. and national chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committee, Mason said.Former TV host-cum-attorney Guilfoyle is now considered as one of the most powerful individuals in the Trump campaign. Both Trump Jr and Guilfoyle have time and again echoed Trump’s love for India and Indian-Americans which is reflected in their remarks at various Indian-American events in New York.“Want to see America work with incredible allies like India to make the world a safer place,” Don Jr said last year.“America embodies family values, values of hardworking people, strong work ethic, entrepreneurial spirit and these values are “shared magnificently with India as well,” said Guilfoyle, who believes that Indian-Americans are a crucial ally for the campaign.“I think we’re so lucky as a country to have so many talented, dedicated, patriotic Indian-Americans making up the incredibly diverse fabric culturally of this country and we’re lucky that they have called it their home,” Guilfoyle, who has helped initiate the process, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-grateful-for-indian-americans-support-white-house/story-XCXEp00a31UpyQ09Fr5hsO.html
27-06-2020||World||‘Immune cells involved in protection against Covid-19 identified’: Study||Patients suffering from severe respiratory symptoms due to the novel coronavirus infection can rapidly generate an immune response in the form of virus-attacking T cells, suggests a new study which may lead to new vaccine development strategies against Covid-19. The study, published in the journal Science Immunology, assessed T cells from 10 Covid-19 patients under intensive care treatment.  According to the researchers, including those from the University of California in the US, two out of 10 healthy individuals without prior exposure to the virus also harbored SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells. Based on this observation, they said these T cells may be cross-reacting to the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, due to past infection with related coronaviruses that cause common cold symptoms. The findings, according to the researchers, address the poorly understood question of whether SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses vary in patients over time depending on disease severity. They said the study may help understand whether patients with more severe symptoms can generate protective virus-specific T cells at all, and offer clues regarding the cells responsible for excessive immune responses which has led to the deaths of many Covid-19 patients. In the research, scientists, including Daniela Weiskopf from the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in the US, extracted blood cells from 10 patients at weekly intervals starting soon after they were admitted to the ICU for Covid-19. They exposed these cells to “megapools” of known SARS-CoV-2 protein components in a technique meant to capture a large fraction of total viral-reactive T cells. The researchers found that SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ helper T cells were active in all 10 patients, and CD8+ “killer” T cells were present in 8 out of 10 patients. They also characterised the cells’ production of specific inflammation-triggering cell-cell signalling molecules called cytokines. According to the scientists, the strongest responses were directed to the virus’ spike (S) surface protein, supporting prior work that has pointed to this protein as a promising target to induce virus-specific T cells. On screening all patients at 0, 7, and 14 days after inclusion in the study revealed that SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were present relatively early during the course of infection, and increased in these patients over time. Using the same T cell stimulation technique in age-matched healthy controls, the researchers found SARS-CoV-2-reactive T cells in 2 out of the 10 individuals. They believe a future study of how preexisting SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in healthy controls correlate to protection against Covid-19 can help shed more light on the disease and “and also inform vaccine design and evaluation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immune-cells-involved-in-protection-against-covid-19-identified-study/story-HS9ptE8JKts531KXgwNWQP.html

The financing was extended last year and has been fully drawn down, a spokesman for Ipex told Bloomberg in an email. There are no hedges to protect the lender from any losses, he added.Other banks are on the hook for about 1.6 billion euros in loans, people familiar with the matter have said. A group of more than a dozen lenders led by ABN Amro Bank NV, Commerzbank AG and ING Groep NV were in negotiations with Wirecard aimed at keeping it afloat and were surprised by the insolvency filing, Bloomberg has reported.Wirecard was once lauded as one of Germany’s most successful up-and-coming businesses. The company’s unraveling quickened earlier this week when it said that 1.9 billion euros previously reported as cash on its balance sheet probably doesn’t exist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-state-bank-faces-112-million-of-losses-from-wirecard/story-Q9GZ1KZ1ABsubfF4kNlwvL.html
27-06-2020||World||Second-generation Covid-19 vaccines are built for impact over speed||Speed isn’t the only thing that matters in the quest for a vaccine to end the Covid-19 pandemic.They may not cross the finish line first, but dozens of companies and universities still see an opening for inoculations that prevent more infections, provide lasting immunity, protect older and more vulnerable people, yield massive quantities or ship easily throughout the world. Those are benefits the front-runners may not be able to deliver.“Is it the tortoise or the hare?” said Seth Berkley, chief executive officer of Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, a global non-profit focused on access to immunizations. “There may be a vaccine we start using that isn’t ideal, and we move to a different one later.”Some of the world’s most prolific and experienced vaccine developers -- Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Merck & Co. -- are among at least 100 challengers trailing the leaders. While they haven’t begun testing their experimental shots in humans, the companies are emerging as formidable contenders in the race to halt a disease that has infected about 10 million people globally, killing half a million.“At this stage everything is still on the table,” said Charlie Weller, the head of vaccines at Wellcome, the U.K.-based health research foundation. “There are so many challenges that some candidates could drop out. Therefore we need multiple approaches.”More than one supplier will probably be needed to make the billions of doses that will required. And some populations may not respond to an initial vaccine, according to Michael Kinch, a drug development expert and associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis.“We may end up creating different classes of society, where you have to stay home and you can go out,” Kinch said. “We haven’t even begun to put our arms and brains around what that would mean.”More than a dozen potential Covid vaccines, including programs led by the University of Oxford and partner AstraZeneca Plc, Moderna Inc., Pfizer Inc. and China’s CanSino Biologics Inc., have started human trials over the past few months. They’re seeking to develop a vaccine in record time, in some cases aiming to provide the initial doses as early as this year.A few of the leaders, including Moderna, are betting on novel RNA-based platforms that prompt the body’s own cells to make proteins that provoke the immune system to react as if it’s been invaded by a pathogen, training it to defend against the real thing. While these vaccines are quick to make, none such product has yet been licensed for people, and it still isn’t clear whether the first Covid vaccines will protect against infection.A recent upturn in U.S. cases underscores the need for a reliable weapon to combat Covid-19. Some vaccines advancing at a slower pace are based on tried-and-true methods, like those containing a weakened form of the virus, Gavi’s Berkley said in an interview. Those could be effective in single doses or have other features that make them easier to use.“You could have a situation where some of the more conventional vaccines, if they provide robust immunity, may be particularly attractive,” he said.One example is a Merck shot based on an approach that was highly effective in single doses against Ebola and became the first approved inoculation for the virus last year. Expected to enter human tests later this year, the coronavirus version could be part of a longer-term solution.Merck wants a vaccine “to deal not just with the pandemic, but the endemic phase” if, like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV-2 becomes established in the human population, CEO Ken Frazier said in an interview.A couple of months behind Oxford in getting to human tests, Imperial College London is focusing on RNA technology, but with a “self-amplifying” feature aimed at inducing immunity with a much smaller dose.“I don’t see the first vaccine to be proven to work as the vaccine that necessarily will be the one that’s used most widely,” said Robin Shattock, a professor at Imperial who’s leading development of a shot. He said he hopes to begin a larger study in October.Rather than developing its own candidate, the U.K. pharmaceutical giant Glaxo is contributing adjuvants -- substances that enhance the body’s immune response -- to a collaboration with Sanofi and others. That would decrease the amount of vaccine each person needs for immunization, and extend supplies. Sanofi expects to start a study compressing the early and middle stages of clinical trials in September.The technology could play a key role in protecting the elderly, who are particularly vulnerable to Covid-19, according to Thomas Breuer, chief medical officer of Glaxo’s vaccines unit. Another huge drug company in the second wave of vaccines, Johnson & Johnson, said this month that it will start human trials in the last half of July, about two months earlier than expected.The company’s goal is to “protect people everywhere from this pandemic,” said Paul Stoffels, J&J’s chief scientific officer.A successful shot may not accomplish everything that’s needed to conquer the virus, Wellcome’s Weller said, and having a number of vaccines would help immunize a broader swath of people. Rolling out vaccines in hot and remote regions could be complex if they require cold-storage supply chains or multiple doses, she said.With the candidates out front “some will fail, and maybe one or two will succeed,” said Breuer, the Glaxo vaccine executive. “We shouldn’t assume the fastest is always the best in terms of longer-term value.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/second-generation-covid-19-vaccines-are-built-for-impact-over-speed/story-0RLrtoCta8BMptjjJJIp6I.html
27-06-2020||World||Judge orders Trump adviser Roger Stone to report to prison by July 14||A federal judge on Friday ordered Roger Stone, President Donald Trump’s longtime friend and adviser, to report to prison by July 14 to begin his sentence after being convicted of seven criminal counts last year, granting him a 14-day extension over concerns about the coronavirus.The 67-year-old veteran Republican operative and self-described “dirty trickster,” who lives in South Florida, had been scheduled to report to a federal prison in Jesup, Georgia, by next Tuesday. Florida is experiencing rising numbers of coronavirus infections.Stone was found guilty by a jury last November of obstruction, witness tampering and lying to Congress under oath during its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson, who in February sentenced him to three years and four months in prison, granted the extension sought by Stone and ordered him placed in home confinement.“This will address the defendant’s stated medical concerns during the current increase of reported cases in Florida, and Broward County in particular, and it will respect and protect the health of other inmates who share defendant’s anxiety over the potential introduction and spread of the virus at this now-unaffected facility,” Berman said.Trump, who has argued that Stone was treated unfairly, declined to answer directly when asked in a Fox News Channel interview on Thursday whether he would issue him a pardon.Stone was one of several Trump associates who were convicted or pleaded guilty to charges stemming from former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that detailed Russian meddling in the 2016 election to boost Trump’s candidacy.He was convicted of lying to the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee about his attempts to contact WikiLeaks, the website that released damaging emails about Trump’s 2016 Democratic election rival Hillary Clinton that US intelligence officials have concluded were stolen by Russian hackers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-orders-trump-adviser-roger-stone-to-report-to-prison-by-july-14/story-GiX3puxUvE9O2XUgJaWz5H.html
27-06-2020||World||Mumbai attack convict Headley cannot be extradited to India; Rana faces extradition: US attorney||Mumbai terrorist attack convict David Headley cannot be extradited to India, but Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman co-conspirator Tahawwur Rana faces extradition, a US attorney has told a federal court while opposing his bail plea.Rana, 59, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was recently rearrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He is a declared fugitive in India.According to the federal prosecutors, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana conspired with Headley, also known as “Daood Gilani”, and others in Pakistan to assist Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US-designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks.Pakistani-American LeT terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.The US is yet to file India’s request for Rana’s extradition, but is expected to do it soon. It is evident that the offences for which Rana was tried in the Illinois court will differ from the Indian offences mentioned in the complaint.Rana in his defence has argued that US’ decision not to extradite his co-conspirator, Headley, to India is inconsistent and bars his extradition.However, Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian told a federal court in Los Angeles on Friday that unlike Rana, Headley immediately accepted responsibility for his conduct and pleaded guilty to all of the charges in the Superseding Indictment.“Because Headley fulfilled the required terms, the plea agreement established that Headley would not be extradited to India. Rana’s situation is different because he neither pleaded guilty nor cooperated with the United States.“As a result, he is unable to avail himself of the benefits afforded to Headley through his negotiated plea. Thus, he cannot complain that he faces extradition, while his co-defendant does not,” the US attorney said.Rana’s bail application is due for hearing next week. Early this week, his attorney told the court that the 26/11 convict is not a flight risk and has proposed a USD 1.5 million bond for his release.“Rana should be released on a robust bond: secured by approximately USD 1.5 million in property pledged by family and friends and under the supervision of his daughter, Lemaan Rana, a matriculating medical student and Ph.D. candidate,” Amy Karlin, the Interim Federal Public Defender, said in the court submission on behalf of Rana.India seeks his arrest on a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating, and murder under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He is sought for his role in 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai.The US attorney urged the court to continue his detention pending the extradition proceedings to India. Describing Rana as a flight risk, the attorney said that no matter what bond package he offers, Rana poses an unacceptable flight risk.If the US extradites Rana to India and he is convicted of the charges, he may be eligible for the death penalty. Given what is at stake, Rana has an extreme incentive to flee and avoid facing these extradition proceedings, Lulejian said.“He could accomplish this by going into hiding within the US, but he has a particular incentive to go to another country that may not extradite him without assurances from India that it will not seek, impose or carry out the death penalty,” the attorney argued.If Rana were to flee to Canada, his extradition from Canada to the US would take years and would require substantial resources by the governments of both Canada and the United States, and there is no guarantee that Canada would ultimately grant that extradition request, he said.However, even if Canada granted the request from the US, the terms of the US-Canada extradition treaty would prohibit the US from extraditing Rana to a third country, such as India, unless Canada granted its consent to do so, Lulejian said.Not only does Rana have an incentive to flee, but he has numerous international connections who can help facilitate his flight, he told the court.Rana ran an international immigration business for many years in Chicago, which allowed him to develop professional and personal relationships around the world.“Moreover, he was convicted of plotting an attack with and providing material support to an international terrorist organisation based in Pakistan. These international connections enhance Rana’s flight risk because they can provide the means to flee this jurisdiction and potentially avoid extradition to India,” Lulejian added.The 2008 Mumbai attack was one of India’s most horrific terrorist attacks in which 166 people were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem.Pakistani national Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, was hanged to death on November 21, 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mumbai-attack-convict-headley-cannot-be-extradited-to-india-rana-faces-extradition-us-attorney/story-gzpnrD7C34vQkzgnyzErNJ.html

He was AWOL||Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli who pushed through the country’s new political map in an effort to consolidate his position in Nepal Communist Party, or NCP, and the government is coming under intense pressure from within to quit one of his two posts. PM Oli is also one of the NCP’s two chairpersons, a post that he shares with his arch rival Pushpa Kamal Dahal, better known by his nom de guerre Prachanda.PM Oli on Friday absented himself from the meeting of the NCP’s powerful standing committee though the party panel was meeting at his official residence. PM Oli had sent word to the panel that he would join them later but never turned up, according to reports in the Kathmandu media.The standing committee meetings were initially scheduled to begin on May 7 but Oli, who is severely short of support within the 44-member panel, had put them off.Kathmandu watchers in Delhi say he had expected the new political map rushed through parliament this month to project himself as one prime minister who stood up to its giant neighbour to shield him from pressure from within. That didn’t appear to be happening when PM Oli attended the first meeting of the standing committee on Thursday. Prachanda, reports in the Nepal media suggest, was merciless in his criticism.Prachanda, according to a report in The Kathmandu Post, had expressed regret for a November pact that agreed to let Oli run the government for five years while he leads the party as executive chair. “Either we have to part ways or we need to mend ways… Since parting is not possible, we need to mend our ways, for which we must be ready to sacrifice,” Prachanda said, according to the Post.PM Oli, who has already been a target of attacks for his government’s handling of th Covid-19 pandemic, did mount a counter attack at Thursday’s meeting. But on Friday, PM Oli, as one Nepal newspaper headlined its report, decided to “play hooky”.“A chairman avoiding his own party’s meeting is disgraceful. He should have listened to his party leaders,” Gokarna Bista, a Standing Committee member who is counted in Prachanda’s camp said, according to the Post.“Many leaders are preparing to seek Oli’s resignation as a majority of the party feels that Oli cannot be trusted to run the government anymore,” said Matrika Yadav, a Standing Committee member also close to Dahal, told the newspaper.PM Oli, according to reports, had hoped to pin down the rival camp with a new political map that depicts Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura that have been controlled by India as part of Nepalese territory. It did get complete support from parliamentarians because no one wanted to be seen to be going against the country’s territorial integrity. But at NCP’s meeting on Friday, there were also suggestions that the Oli government should have handled the entire row better.The Post quoted two NCP members as saying that the Oli government was criticised for not doing adequate homework to hold talks with India, failing to cultivate alternative lines of communication with New Delhi, and also failing to propagate Nepal’s claim to its lands on national and international platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-communist-party-s-top-panel-met-at-pm-oli-s-house-he-was-awol/story-4izK7g1wMlSFrZ42be8mpN.html

Violence has include burning houses and killing cattle.Militias from the Peulh community were behind dozens of violent incidents with the Dogon community — mainly farmers and hunters — that killed 210 people, her office said. Dogon-related groups carried out 12 attacks, leaving at least 82 people dead, it said.The human rights division of the UN peacekeeping mission has documented “230 extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions” attributed to the Malian military in the central regions of Mopti and Segou, Bachelet’s office said.She lamented “a situation of chronic insecurity for the civilian population, who are not able to count on the protection of the Malian forces.” “This needs to stop,” Bachelet said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-human-rights-chief-urges-mali-to-probe-abuse-by-security-forces/story-WdVQBj7HyENBgQTfCE2B9N.html
27-06-2020||World||51st state: US House approves statehood of Washington, DC, in historic vote||Four decades after launching its drive for U.S. statehood, Washington, D.C., was poised to take a step toward becoming the 51st state as the House of Representatives on Friday approved its admission.The initiative passed in the Democratic-controlled House by a vote of 232-180, with no Republicans supporting it.The Republican-controlled Senate is not expected to consider the legislation, and Republican President Donald Trump has publicly opposed the move, noting that statehood would result in electing more Democrats to Congress. Indeed, voters in the city of Washington have elected only Democratic mayors. Creating a state out of Washington would likely make it more difficult for Republicans to win majorities in the Senate.On the House floor ahead of the vote, Republican lawmakers argued that making the district into a state was a political ploy by Democrats and would require an amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Some also said Washington was not equipped to be a state and should be absorbed back into Maryland.Proponents say Washington’s 700,000 inhabitants - more than Vermont and Wyoming - have no voice in the federal government, despite paying federal taxes. That status is protested with a slogan on Washington’s automobile license plates that screams: “Taxation without representation.”Currently, legislation passed by the district’s local government is subject to congressional review.“Congress has two choices: It can continue to exercise undemocratic, autocratic authority over the 705,000 American citizens who reside in our nation’s capital ... or Congress can live up to its nation’s promise and ideals,” said Eleanor Holmes Norton, Washington’s congresswoman. Norton is not able to vote on legislation.Local anger over the district’s status flared up most recently during the coronavirus pandemic. Washington received $500 million for its pandemic response, compared with the $1.2 billion the federal government accorded to each of the 50 states.Amid nationwide protests sparked by the killing of George Floyd, an African-American man who died after a police officer kneeled against Floyd’s neck, Trump sent National Guard troops to the district, over the objection of the district’s mayor, to quell protests against racism and police brutality.The state would be named Washington, Douglass Commonwealth, after George Washington, the first U.S. president, and Frederick Douglass, a former enslaved person turned famed abolitionist.It would include the district’s residents, but not major federal buildings, the National Mall, memorials and the museums, which would be housed in a federal enclave.The last time the United States expanded was 1959, when Congress approved admitting Alaska and Hawaii as the 49th and 50th states, respectively, following congressional votes and the support of the president.The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to admit new states without specifying a process.Washington, dubbed a “Chocolate City” by the funk band Parliament, has been recorded as a majority-Black city since the 1960 Census. Black Americans now make up 46% of the district’s population, the same percentage of White Americans.

27-06-2020||World||Nile countries agree to restart talks over disputed dam||The leaders of Egypt, Sudan and Ethiopia agreed late Friday to return to talks aimed at reaching an accord over the filling of Ethiopia’s new hydroelectric dam on the Blue Nile, according to statements from the three nations.Early Saturday, Seleshi Bekele, Ethiopia’s water and energy minister, confirmed that the countries had decided during an African Union summit to restart stalled negotiations and finalize an agreement over the contentious mega-project within two to three weeks, with support from the AU.The announcement was a modest reprieve from weeks of bellicose rhetoric and escalating tensions over the $4.6 billion Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, which Ethiopia had vowed to start filling at the start of the rainy season in July.Egypt and Sudan said Ethiopia would refrain from filling the dam next month until the countries reached a deal. Ethiopia did not comment explicitly on the start of the filling period.Ethiopia has hinged its development ambitions on the colossal dam, describing it as a crucial lifeline to bring millions out of poverty.Egypt, which relies on the Nile for more than 90% of its water supplies and already faces high water stress, fears a devastating impact on its booming population of 100 million. Sudan, which also depends on the Nile for water, has played a key role in bringing the two sides together after the collapse of U.S.-mediated talks in February.Just last week, Ethiopian Foreign Minister Gedu Andargachew warned that his country could begin filling the dam’s reservoir unilaterally, after the latest round of talks with Egypt and Sudan failed to reach an accord governing how the dam will be filled and operated.After an AU video conference chaired by South Africa late Friday, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi said that “all parties” had pledged not to take “any unilateral action” by filling the dam without a final agreement, said Bassam Radi, Egypt’s presidency spokesman.Sudanese Prime Minister Abdalla Hamdok also indicated the impasse between the Nile basin countries had eased, saying the nations had agreed to restart negotiations through a technical committee with the aim of finalizing a deal in two weeks. Ethiopia won’t fill the dam before inking the much-anticipated deal, Hamdok’s statement added.African Union Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat said the countries “agreed to an AU-led process to resolve outstanding issues,” without elaborating.Sticking points in the talks have been how much water Ethiopia will release downstream from the dam if a multi-year drought occurs and how Ethiopia, Egypt and Sudan will resolve any future disagreements.Both Egypt and Sudan have appealed to the UN Security Council to intervene in the years-long dispute and help the countries avert a crisis. The council is set to hold a public meeting on the issue Monday.Filling the dam without an agreement could bring the stand-off to a critical juncture. Both Egypt and Ethiopia have hinted at military steps to protect their interests, and experts fear a breakdown in talks could lead to open conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nile-countries-agree-to-restart-talks-over-disputed-dam/story-6Ws7z3HXhN43lxRUiftjwL.html

Beijing reported its first case in the current outbreak on June 11 which stemmed from a sprawling wholesale food centre in the southwest of the capital. Nearly 300 people in the city of more than 20 million have contracted the virus.Mainland China reported four new so-called imported cases on Friday, infections linked to travellers arriving from abroad. China’s Covid-19 tally now stands at 83,483 with death toll stood at 4,634, unchanged since mid-May.United StatesIn the US, a top public health official has said that the actual number of cumulative Covid-19 infections in the country could be around 10 times the reported number.“We are facing a serious problem in certain areas,” leading US immunologist Anthony Fauci said at the first briefing in two months by the White House’s Coronavirus Task Force.“The only way we’re going to end it is by ending it together,” he said of the outbreak.The US currently leads the global tally with over 2.5 million Covid-19 cases and is reporting over 30,000 cases daily. With nearly 125,000 lives lost, it has by far the highest confirmed Covid-19 death toll in the world.

27-06-2020||World||28 gunmen, allegedly from Jalisco drug cartel, ambush Mexico City police chief||Dozens of gunmen believed tied to the hyper-violent Jalisco New Generation Cartel deployed for a complex, multi-point dawn ambush meant to kill Mexico City’s police chief, unleashing one of the most brazen attacks in Mexico since the equally ruthless Zetas carved a path of terror across the country nearly a decade ago.The attackers used grenades and a .50-caliber sniper rifle to assault the chief’s armored vehicle early Friday and killed two of the his bodyguards and a woman driving by. Police chief Omar García Harfuch was shot in the shoulder, collar bone and the knee but was reported out of danger.He called the attack “cowardly” and blamed it on the Jalisco cartel, which has established a nearly national presence, from the white-sand beaches of Cancun to Mexico City and the country’s most important ports, as well as in key border cities traditionally controlled by other cartels.Police officers who converged on the scene on the capital’s iconic Paseo de la Reforma boulevard in the upscale Lomas neighborhood rounded up a dozen of the shooters, who were hauled off for questioning, authorities said.Later Friday, capital police arrested an alleged head of Jalisco New Generation hitmen, suggesting he could have been the mastermind of the attack, said a Mexico City police official who was not authorized to be quoted by name.The official said police arrested José Armando Briseño on the east side of the city. Nicknamed “Cow,” he is allegedly the gang’s chief of hitmen in the city of Tonalá inJalisco.The attack on the police chief was meticulously planned and involved a total of 28 gunmen hired three weeks before, said Ulises Lara, the spokesman for the Mexico City prosecutors office. Three separate possible ambush points were set up on major thoroughfares, including one — which wasn’t used — in the heart of Mexico City, one block from the Independence Monument.The gunmen were divided into four different cells, and they received ski masks and weapons Thursday night. They were taken to the ambush points at 4 a.m. to lie in wait for their target. They jumped from a truck and opened fire when Garcia’s convoy attempted to pass.Lara said that of the suspects detained, one is Colombian and the other 11 are Mexicans from the capital and five states — Jalisco, Guerrero, Nayarit, Chihuahua and Michoacan.It was the second high-profile attack just this month, following the shooting death of a federal judge and his wife, bringing uncomfortable comparisons to Colombia’s drug wars of the 1980s and ‘90s in which drug traffickers routinely targeted judges and police for assassination.Mexico targeted and dismantled the Zetas cartel after it killed migrants, unsuspecting citizens and officials from 2010 to 2013. But it remains to be seen whether the government will go after the Jalisco cartel they way it did the Zetas.“If they (Jalisco) are not made a priority target after this, I don’t know what is happening, something is wrong with the strategy” of the government, said security analyst Alejandro Hope.With the Zetas, Mexico used elite military units and worked closely with the United States to go after the cartel. But now, amid budget cuts and President Andrés Manuel López Obrador’s policy of not directly confronting the cartels, it is unclear whether the government has the will or ability to fight Jalisco, especially in the middle of the coronavirus pandemic.“This kind of attack is not normal, they crossed a line. You have to read it like an exceptional act,” said Hope. “You have two very serious attacks in two weeks.”Federal Security Secretary Alfonso Durazo said Mexico’s intelligence agency apparently had information that Jalisco New Generation was planning an attack, but did not offer additional details.It was unclear whether the attack was related to recent crackdowns on Jalisco-affiliated gangs in Mexico City or to the police chief’s earlier work in federal investigations.García, 37, is a former head of the Federal Police investigation division and in 2016-2019 he led the branch of the federal Attorney General’s Office that oversees investigations and arrests of organized crime members. Before being named Mexico City police chief, he spent several months as the mayor’s intelligence coordinator.Jalisco is the same gang that U.S. prosecutors said tried to buy belt-fed M-60 machine guns in the United States and that once shot down a Mexican military helicopter with a rocket-propelled grenade. In October, the cartel’s gunmen ambushed and killed 14 state police officers in Michoacan.Friday’s attack came two weeks after rumors swirled for a day that Jalisco’s leader, Nemesio Oseguera Cervantes, better known as “El Mencho,” had been captured or killed — though officials later denied that. Oseguera is the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s most-wanted fugitive, with a $10 million price on his head.In March, US authorities arrested hundreds of Jalisco operatives in raids across the United States. They said the gang controls between one-third and two-thirds of the U.S. drug market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/28-gunmen-allegedly-from-jalisco-drug-cartel-ambush-mexico-city-police-chief/story-UT2Qv6FELbiFizGUNk0V1O.html
27-06-2020||World||Trump signs ‘strong’ executive order to protect monuments||President Donald Trump signed an executive order Friday to protect monuments, memorials and statues facing new scrutiny amid fresh debate over the nation’s racist beginnings.Trump had promised to take action earlier this week after police thwarted an attempt by protesters to pull down a statue of Andrew Jackson in a park across from the White House.The order calls on the attorney general to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law any person or group that destroys or vandalizes a monument, memorial or statue. Federal law authorizes a penalty of up to 10 years in prison for the “willful injury” of federal property.The order also calls for maximum prosecution for anyone who incites violence and illegal activity, and it threatens state and local law enforcement agencies that fail to protect monuments with the loss of federal funding.Trump announced earlier Friday on Twitter that he had signed the order and called it “strong.”Earlier in the day, the president used Twitter to call for the arrest of protesters involved with the attempt to bring down the Jackson statue from Lafayette Park.He retweeted an FBI wanted poster showing pictures of 15 protesters who are wanted for “vandalization of federal property.”Trump wrote, “MANY people in custody, with many others being sought for Vandalization of Federal Property in Lafayette Park. 10 year prison sentences!”He also said on Twitter that he had scrapped plans to spend the weekend at his central New Jersey home to stay in Washington “to make sure LAW & ORDER is enforced.”“These arsonists, anarchists, looters, and agitators have been largely stopped,” Trump tweeted. “I am doing what is necessary to keep our communities safe — and these people will be brought to Justice!”Protesters on Monday night attempted to drag the Jackson statue down with ropes and chains. Police repelled the protesters and sealed off Lafayette Park, which had been reopened to the public for more than a week after protests against the death of George Floyd at police hands in Minnesota. On Tuesday, police cleared out the entire area around the corner of 16th and H streets — and pushed demonstrators away from the intersection, which had recently been renamed Black Lives Matter Plaza by the city.Statistics released by the Metropolitan Police Department show that nine people were arrested Tuesday night and a total of 12 arrested between Monday and Wednesday. There were no protest-related arrests Thursday, according to the MPD data.Demonstrators have grown increasingly emboldened about targeting statues deemed offensive or inappropriate. On June 19, or Juneteenth, the day marking the end of slavery in the United States, cheering crowds puled down a statue of Confederate Gen. Albert Pike. The statue stood on federal land and had withstood previous attempts by the Washington, D.C., government to remove it. According to participants, police officers were on the scene but did not attempt to interfere.The targeting of the statues has become a rallying cry for Trump and other conservatives. Immediately after the Pike statute was toppled and set ablaze, Trump called the incident a “disgrace to our Country!” on Twitter.On Tuesday he tweeted, “I have authorized the Federal Government to arrest anyone who vandalizes or destroys any monument, statue or other such Federal property in the U.S. with up to 10 years in prison, per the Veteran’s Memorial Preservation Act, or such other laws that may be pertinent.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-signs-strong-executive-order-to-protect-monuments/story-6cbrEhN5mDFBJtBc3q903O.html

The ambush left chief Omar García Harfuch wounded with three bullet impacts and shrapnel. Two members of his security detail were killed, as was a woman who happened to be driving by.A day earlier in the Pacific coast state of Sinaloa, state police said they had found the bodies of seven men wearing military-style clothing in a pickup truck in a rural area near the city of Culiacán. In another area nearby, police found nine more bodies, at least one of which had an assault rifle. Two bullet-riddled vehicles were found nearby. There had been a series of shootouts there Wednesday.Sinaloa is home the cartel of the same name, and the dead men appeared to have been involved in turf battles between factions of the cartel.“Clearly there is a fight between organized crime groups in this area,” said state police chief Cristobal Castañeda, noting that in the last month police have seized five belt-fed machine guns, two .50-caliber sniper rifles and about 35,000 bullets in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/30-bodies-found-dumped-in-2-northern-mexico-states/story-epzH0Y4KjTKfLQuREckjuL.html
27-06-2020||World||Mark Zuckerberg loses $7 billion as companies boycott Facebook ads||Mark Zuckerberg just became $7.2 billion poorer after a flurry of companies pulled advertising from Facebook Inc.’s network.Shares of the social media company fell 8.3% on Friday, the most in three months, after Unilever, one of the world’s largest advertisers, joined other brands in boycotting ads on the social network. Unilever said it would stop spending money with Facebook’s properties this year.The share-price drop eliminated $56 billion from Facebook’s market value and pushed Zuckerberg’s net worth down to $82.3 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That also moved the Facebook chief executive officer down one notch to fourth place, overtaken by Louis Vuitton boss Bernard Arnault, who was elevated to one of the world’s three richest people along with Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates.Companies from Verizon Communications Inc. to Hershey Co. have also stopped social media ads after critics said that Facebook has failed to sufficiently police hate speech and disinformation on the platform. Coca-Cola Co. said it would pause all paid advertising on all social media platforms for at least 30 days.Zuckerberg responded Friday to the growing criticism about misinformation on the site, announcing the company would label all voting-related posts with a link encouraging users to look at its new voter information hub. Facebook also expanded its definition of prohibited hate speech, adding a clause saying no adverts will be allowed if they label another demographic as dangerous.“There are no exceptions for politicians in any of the policies I’m announcing here today,” Zuckerberg said.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mark-zuckerberg-loses-7-billion-as-companies-boycott-facebook-ads/story-GQ4uSwy0K5zhqpxnihZvvJ.html
27-06-2020||World||Pakistan’s anti-graft body files corruption case against former PM Nawaz Sharif||Pakistan’s anti-graft body has filed a corruption case against deposed prime minister Nawaz Sharif and three others for their alleged involvement in the illegal allotment of land in Punjab province about 34 years ago. An arrest warrant has been issued against the 70-year-old three-time premier who is in London for medical treatment. The National Accountability Bureau (NAB) has approached an anti-corruption court to declare Sharif a proclaimed offender since he did not respond to any of its summons. The three other accused named in the case filed by the NAB are Jang/Geo media group owner Mir Shakilur Rahman, former Lahore Development Authority (LDA) director Humayun Faiz Rasool and former director (land) Mian Bashir. In 1986, when he was the Punjab chief minister, Sharif had allegedly allotted 54-’kanal’ (canal) land in Lahore to Mir Shakilur Rehman in violation of rules. Rahman, who was arrested on March 12, is on judicial remand. In the reference, Sharif and the two officers were accused of the misuse of authority in allotting the precious land along the canal to Rahman in violation of the rules. Sharif had left for London in November after the Lahore High Court granted him a four-week permission to go abroad for treatment.He had submitted an undertaking to the court to return to Pakistan, citing his record of facing the law and justice, within four weeks or as soon as he is declared healthy and fit to travel by doctors.Last month, a fresh picture of ‘ailing’ Sharif having tea at a London cafe along with his family went viral on social media, sparking a debate on his health with the ruling Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf members demanding his return to face corruption cases.In the picture, he was seen sitting at a roadside café with his granddaughters. He sported a blue shalwar kameez and a cap and apparently looked in better health. Sharif was given bail in the Al-Azizia Mills corruption case, in which he was serving a seven-year prison sentence in Kot Lakhpat Jail. He was also given bail in a money-laundering case to facilitate his travel abroad. Sharif was diagnosed with “complicated coronary artery/ischemic heart disease with significant disease burden”. His daughter Maryam Nawaz had said that her father was a high-risk patient therefore his cardiac catheterisation/coronary intervention had been postponed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-s-anti-graft-body-files-corruption-case-against-former-pm-nawaz-sharif/story-UegFZrOFrKVMqBQV3JWwEM.html
27-06-2020||World||Canadian visa program may lure tech workers blocked by Trump||A fast-track visa program that Canada launched in 2017 has attracted a growing number of tech workers, and US President Donald Trump’s latest immigration crackdown is set to further boost intake once Covid-19 restrictions ease, lawyers say.The number of successful applicants to Canada’s Global Skills Strategy (GSS) program rose five-fold over its first three years, with more than 23,000 workers approved under the top five tech categories, data provided to Reuters by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) shows.More than 2,300 applications for those same top five tech roles were approved from January to March 2020, ahead of the Covid-19 shutdowns that led to border closures and a sharp drop in immigration. The program boasts a two-week processing time.Immigration lawyers told Reuters they were broadly in favor of the program, which some described as transparent and consistent, and an example of how Canada has been able to take advantage of Trump’s immigration stance since he entered the White House in 2017.“There are employers who have non-US employees in the US who are definitely looking seriously at Canada,” said Kyle Hyndman, a partner with McCrea Immigration Law in Vancouver, who was contacted this week by a “major” company about bringing employees to Canada.On Monday, Trump issued a presidential proclamation that temporarily blocks foreign workers from entering the United States on certain visas, which a Trump administration official said would create 525,000 jobs for US workers.“The fact that people started contacting me pretty much the next day is perhaps a suggestion that there are going to be more people interested,” Hyndman said.US technology companies including Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc, Facebook Inc and Netflix Inc have in recent years expanded their Canadian operations, although most companies declined to comment on their GSS usage or how Trump’s recent announcement will impact their hiring plans.Tobi Lutke, the chief executive officer of Canadian e-commerce company Shopify, was quick to tout the Canada’s attraction following Trump’s immigration move.The program “has made it possible to hire top talent beyond our borders,” said Sandeep Anand, senior lead on the global mobility team at Shopify, adding that it has helped relocate employees to Canada.The majority of approved applicants to the fast-track visa program were computer programmers and interactive media developers, followed by information systems analysts and consultants, the IRCC data shows.Indian citizens accounted for 62.1% of successful applicants to the fast-track program, followed by Chinese citizens. Nearly 1,000 US citizens also have seen their applications approved.The GSS data only covers the period up to March of this year, just before broader immigration in Canada fell off a cliff due to border closures to stop the spread of the novel coronavirus. Lawyers, however, don’t expect it to last.Betsy Kane, one of the founding partners of Capelle Kane Immigration Lawyers in Ottawa, said the program is going to see a surge of applications.“Whenever one door shuts, the other door is sought.”(Reporting by Moira Warburton in Toronto and Steve Scherer in Ottawa; Additional reporting by Julie Gordon in Ottawa Editing by Denny Thomas and Paul Simao)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-visa-program-may-lure-tech-workers-blocked-by-trump/story-We3mdtFT77io6FLlx5K6EN.html
