The two Pakistan-based terrorist outfits have carried out multiple attacks in India. There are in all 6,500 foreign terrorists from Pakistan in Afghanistan.In an agreement signed by US and Taliban representatives in Doha on February 29, the Americans have undertaken to draw down their troops in Afghanistan in exchange for the Taliban committing to certain anti-terrorism measures, chiefly cutting ties with terrorist groups threatening the security of the United States or its allies, and not allow them to operate from Afghanistan. Exchange of prisoners, removal of sanctions on the Taliban and the launch of intra-Afghan talks were the other elements.“The Taliban regularly consulted with Al-Qaida during negotiations with the United States and offered guarantees that it would honour their historical ties,” a UN-appointed Monitoring Team said in its annual report to the UN Security Council.It added: “Al-Qaida has reacted positively to the agreement, with statements from its acolytes celebrating it as a victory for the Taliban’s cause and thus for global militancy.”The report refers, as evidence, to a reported meeting that took place in the spring of 2019 between senior Taliban officials and Hamza bin Laden, son and successor of Osama bin Laden, “to reassure him personally that the Islamic Emirate would not break its historical ties with Al-Qaida for any price”. The Al-Qaeda leader’s death was announced by President Trump in September.The monitoring team cited Afghan officials to detail the continued presence of LeT and JeM, who, the report said, had 1,020 and 230 fighters in Afghanistan respectively, “co-located” with Taliban forces. JeM did not figure int he team’s 2019 report. These groups, the repot added, “facilitate the trafficking of terrorist fighters into Afghanistan, who act as advisers, trainers and specialists in improvised explosive devices”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taliban-retain-ties-with-al-qaeda-says-un-report/story-BddfirTh7fod63ZtMMizfJ.html
01-06-2020||World||Donald Trump slams governors as ‘weak,’ urges crackdown on protests||President Donald Trump on Monday derided the nation’s governors as “weak” and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters in the aftermath of another night of violent protests in dozens of American cities.Trump spoke to governors on a video teleconference with law enforcement and national security officials, telling the local leaders they “have to get much tougher” amid nationwide protests and criticizing their responses.“Most of you are weak,” Trump said. “You have to arrest people.”The days of protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. They turned violent in several cities, with looting and mayhem, and fires ignited in the historic park across from the White House.The president urged the governors to deploy the National Guard, which he credited for helping calm the situation Sunday night in Minneapolis. He demanded that similarly tough measures be taken in cities that also experienced a spasm of violence, like New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles.“You’ve got to arrest people, you have to track people, you have to put them in jail for 10 years and you’ll never see this stuff again,” said Trump. “We’re doing it in Washington, D.C. We’re going to do something that people haven’t seen before.”The president told the governors they were making themselves “look like fools” for not calling up more of the National Guard as a show for force on city streets.Attorney General Bill Barr, who was also on the call, told governors that a joint terrorist task force would be used to track the agitators and urged local officials to “dominate” the streets and control, not react to crowds, and urged them to “go after troublemakers.”Trump’s angry exhortations at the nation’s governors came after a night of escalating violence, images of fires and looting and clashes with police filling the nation’s airwaves and overshadowing the largely peaceful protests. The protests grew so heated Friday night that the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks.Trump continued his effort to project strength, using a series of inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks during a time of national crisis.As cities burned night after night and images of violence dominated television coverage, Trump’s advisers discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president’s own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity.Trump did not appear in public on Sunday and was not scheduled to so Monday either.Secret Service agents rushed Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades.Trump spent nearly an hour in the bunker, which was designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on the condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on the condition of anonymity.The protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. The demonstrations in Washington turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001.“The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. The president’s move to the bunker was first reported by The New York Times.The president and his family have been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, according to the Republican. It was not immediately clear if first lady Melania Trump and the couple’s 14-year-old son, Barron, joined the president in the bunker. Secret Service protocol would have called for all those under the agency’s protection to be in the underground shelter.Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service.Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening.Trump continued his effort to project strength, using a series of inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks during a time of national crisis.On Sunday, Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force.“This isn’t going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,” Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president.In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police.The Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.___Lemire reported from New York.

01-06-2020||World||Donald Trump, family sheltered in WH bunker first night of protests||As protests against the death of George Floyd, an African American man, in police custody continued countrywide for the sixth day, it has been reported that President Donald Trump and his family were briefly taken into an underground bunker at the White House last Friday as demonstrators had surged outside.The Secret Service escorted Trump, his wife Melania Trump and their son Barron to the Presidential Emergency Operations Centre — as the bunker is called — as officials seemed to have been taken off guard by the number of protestors, the New York Times reported Sunday.The last time the bunker is publicly known to have been used was on September 11, 2001, when Vice-President Dick Cheney was taken there as a plane was feared to be headed for the White House. President George W Bush, who was out of town at the time, was taken there later in the day over false alarm about another plane.Friday night was the first time protestors had converged around the White House. They had clashed with Secret Service and other law enforcement personnel, defaced buildings in the vicinity with expletive-laden graffiti about the president. The next morning, Trump had tweeted about “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons” that awaited the protestors is any of them breached the security and entered the White House premises.Trump has threatened to designate Antifa, who he has blamed for the violence and looting that has accompanied protests in some parts of the country, as a terrorist organization. Antifa, short for anti-fascism, is a movement and not an organization. Besides, it was been noted, only foreign bodies can be labeled terrorist organization under current US law.Security around the White House has been stepped up extensively with barricades all around to prevent protestors from getting close. But protestors continued undeterred for the third night Sunday. They with clashed with the police — chanting “You’re the threat” and other slogans — and vandalized and defaced of public and private properties around the area.Among those destroyed was the Oval Room, an iconic restaurant a short distance from the White House, across Lafayette Park, which has been a frequent venue for protests.“I got a call around midnight Saturday asking me two switch on the TV,” said Ashok Bajaj, its Indian-descent owner. Protestors had smashed the windows and were setting tables on fire. He reached there around 1:00 am (Sunday morning) helplessly watched the restaurant burn. His second restaurant on the same street, Bombay Club, just across the road, was left untouched.“I have been here for more than 30 years and have never seen anything like this,” Bajaj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-family-sheltered-in-wh-bunker-first-night-of-protests/story-rGHR1mhtnCg5re5DW2zOTI.html
01-06-2020||World||New test method offers safer dosages of hydroxychloroquine||Researchers have developed a new method to measure levels of the medication hydroxychloroquine in patients with the rheumatic disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The method developed by researchers at Uppsala University and Uppsala University Hospital in Sweden may also be useful in other areas, such as in the treatment of Covid-19. Hydroxychloroquine was originally used to treat malaria but has also proven effective with SLE and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), the researchers said. Today it is recommended to all SLE patients since it protects against flares of the disease. Tests are now being conducted to see if it can also be used to treat Covid-19, they said. A disadvantage of hydroxychloroquine is its side effects which can be avoided, however, if the dosage is adjusted for each patient. To achieve the protective effect against flares in SLE while also minimising the risk of side effects, researchers developed a method that can be used in the medical care system to measure hydroxychloroquine levels in the blood of SLE patients. The method, described in the journal Arthritis Research and Therapy, is based on high-resolution mass spectrometry. The researchers went through available data on hydroxychloroquine measurements. They saw that results from measurements on whole blood, plasma and serum were not comparable with each other. “It was shown that there were major differences between different reports, and there seemed to be very large individual differences,” said Kim Kultima, Associate Professor at Uppsala University. The team compared the levels of hydroxychloroquine in plasma, serum and whole blood in SLE patients. They concluded that the levels in whole blood were about twice as high as in serum and plasma. Whole blood analyses were also the most dependable. “One striking result, and a very important insight, was that levels in whole blood for patients prescribed the same dosage could differ by up to 15 times between individuals. This indicates a large individual variation in how the medication is metabolised,” the researchers said. One problem pointed out by the study is that the services for electronic information on medicinal products in Sweden (FASS) provides concentrations of hydroxychloroquine in plasma. The researchers judge that these values provide an inaccurate and inappropriate picture for monitoring medication levels in patients. “We also have to be very careful about drawing hasty conclusions about whether hydroxychloroquine is effective with Covid-19. “What we know today is that the analysis method will hopefully lead to better data for providing the right dosages to SLE patients who are prescribed the medication,” the researchers said. They are planning to measure the levels of the medication in the blood of Covid-19 patients if the substance proves effective.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-test-method-offers-safer-dosages-of-hydroxychloroquine/story-XkpcR35L0d1uqhbQSzlpLN.html

In more than 90% of countries, health care staff had been partially or fully reassigned to pandemic duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-disrupted-treatments-for-non-communicable-diseases-like-cancer-who/story-BBnAgVSEGOW27m7V3p9CIO.html

Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian, referring to the largescale protests and riots following the death of African-American George Floyd, added that racial discrimination is a long-standing problem in the US and Beijing hoped the US government would take all necessary measures to deal with the violent law enforcement of police, so as to protect and safeguard the legitimate interests of racial minorities.Black lives matter and their human rights should be protected, he said.Current ties between the two countries have increasingly soured in recent months over several issues including on the origins of the coronavirus, arms sales Taiwan and ongoing disputes over trade.On Hong Kong, Zhao said any move by the US to harm Chinese interests will be met with firm countermeasures, questioning Washington’s decision to begin ending special treatment for Hong Kong as well as actions against Chinese students and companies.Trump ordered his administration to begin the process of eliminating special US treatment for Hong Kong in response to China’s parliament last week voting to implement a new national security legislation on Hong Kong, which, critics say, could impact the “one country, two systems” mechanism.The US President, however, hasn’t mentioned a timeline for the withdrawal of the special status.“The announced measures severely interfere with China’s internal affairs, damage U.S.-China relations, and will harm both sides. China is firmly opposed to this,” Zhao said at the regular ministry briefing on Monday.“Any words or actions by the U.S. that harm China’s interests will meet with China’s firm counterattack,” he said.Earlier, Hong Kong’s Beijing-backed government was quoted in news reports as telling the US to keep out of the national security debate, warning that withdrawal of the financial hub’s special status could backfire on the US economy.On Trump’s announcement that the US would leave the WHO, Zhao said the “…US has become addicted to quitting groups and scrapping treaties”.Trump announced on Friday the US would cut ties with the WHO, accusing the UN agency of becoming China’s puppet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-fires-a-salvo-of-criticism-at-us-on-hk-protests-wanting-to-quit-who/story-nIJ7UVsdL3lUJJZ2tZRGaK.html

The city, of some 11 million residents, had completed testing over 3 million before the mass testing began in the middle of May.No new asymptomatic cases reported for the first time indicates the campaign has seen apparent effects, said a statement from the local health authorities. The total number of confirmed cases in mainland China now stands at 83,017, while the death toll remains at 4,634.The National Health Commission (NHC) said in a statement on Monday that all the 16 confirmed cases involved travellers from overseas.They came on a flight from Egypt, and another six asymptomatic cases were found on the same flight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-60-000-tested-in-wuhan-on-sunday-no-silent-spreaders-of-covid-19-found/story-1NsrFcoiZ1F66xIGlFi8xO.html

Primary school children also returned to class. Strict public safety measures have kept Greece’s Covid-19 infection rate low. The country has seen only 175 virus-related deaths, according to Health Ministry. International flights with screening procedures will return to Athens and Greece’s second-largest city of Thessaloniki starting on June 15, and will be expanded to the rest of the country on July 1. Screening for arriving passengers will be based on an assessment by a European Union flight safety authority, with arrivals from low-infection countries being subjected only to random testing. Year-round hotels were allowed to reopen Monday but many chose to remain closed until closer to the start of the tourism season, citing low bookings. Other businesses were allowed to restart Monday, including campsites, wedding reception services, tattoo parlors and dating agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-greece-lifts-its-lockdown-on-hotels-pools-golf-courses/story-DQyXVM9fcVWYQ2Sf5V40BJ.html
01-06-2020||World||‘Saudi game of thrones’: Pressure grows to release jailed prince Salman bin Abdulaziz||A $2 million US lobbying effort and petitions from European lawmakers are piling pressure on Saudi Arabia to release a philanthropist prince jailed for two years without charge amid an intensifying royal crackdown.The detention of Prince Salman bin Abdulaziz and his father since January 2018 is part of a clampdown under de facto ruler Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman that has ensnared not just potential rivals but also figures posing no visible challenge to his hold on power.The dangerous power plays have also swept up family members of Saad Aljabri, a former aide to another detained prince and top intelligence official, who fled to Canada and holds key state secrets.The most unlikely target is Prince Salman, a multilingual 37-year-old educated at Paris’s Sorbonne University, who apparently espoused no political ambitions and earned a reputation of being a “walking blank check” for funding development projects in poor countries.“This is not just an unlawful arrest,” an associate of the prince told AFP. “This is daylight kidnapping. This is a forced disappearance.”After being detained for around a year in the high-security Al-Ha’ir prison near Riyadh and later in a private villa with his father Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman, the prince was moved to a secret detention site in March, multiple sources told AFP.He was mysteriously returned to the villa last week to be reunited with his father, three of those sources said.It remains unclear why he was moved to the secret site. His telephone calls to his family are monitored by Saudi intelligence, the sources said.But his return may be a tentative sign that international pressure for his release is working. Saudi authorities did not respond to a request for comment on the case.- Pressure campaign -A delegation from the European Parliament implored Saudi authorities to release detained royals including Prince Salman during a visit to Riyadh in February, according to a source and an internal report of the tour seen by AFP.“The European Parliament already asked for information about the case in a letter addressed... to the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, which (remains) unanswered,” Marc Tarabella, a vice chairman of the parliament’s delegation for relations with the Arab peninsula, wrote to the European Commission.“I would like to ask you to raise this issue... with the highest relevant authorities in Saudi Arabia appealing for Prince Salman’s release.“I remain confident that the release would positively impact the relations of the European Parliament with Saudi Arabia,” he wrote.Separately, leading Washington lobbyist Robert Stryk’s Sonoran Policy Group signed a $2 million contract in May to advocate for the prince’s release “with the governments of the United States, United Kingdom, France, and the European Union”, according to a US justice department filing seen by AFP.Stryk, known to have close connections with the administration of US President Donald Trump -- an ally of Prince Mohammed -- was recruited by Hashim Mughal, a Paris-based confidant of Prince Salman, according to the filing.A source described Mughal, a Pakistani national, as the prince’s former financial advisor who raised $2 million from his personal wealth and by tapping the influential royal’s friends.The international effort is a gamble that could backfire in a kingdom whose authoritarian rulers are strongly averse to public criticism.But as private appeals to the rulers go unheeded, the campaign may be the only hope at a time when the kingdom is grappling with a coronavirus-led economic slump and amid unease in Washington with Prince Mohammed’s aggressive policies.- ‘Game of thrones’ -Prince Salman is among a wave of royals detained as Prince Mohammed, known as MBS, eliminates potential rivals to amass power unseen by previous rulers.In March, authorities arrested the Saudi king’s brother Prince Ahmed and nephew Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, who was edged out as heir to the throne by MBS in 2017.Two adult children and a brother of Saad Aljabri, once a senior aide to Prince Nayef, were also detained in March, with a source close to the family calling them “victims of a Saudi game of thrones”.Aljabri, exiled in Canada, earlier attempted to get his children to leave Saudi Arabia but authorities had placed them under a travel ban, the source told AFP.Princess Basmah bint Saud, another royal perceived to be close to Prince Nayef, has been jailed in Al-Ha’ir for a year without charge along with her daughter.Her family lost all contact with the princess after they posted a desperate Twitter appeal for her release in April, a source has told AFP.More baffling is the detention of Prince Salman, whose non-political philanthropic work makes him an unlikely rival to MBS.What may have rankled the royal court is the prince’s meeting with Congressman Adam Schiff, a Democrat and Trump critic, just before US elections in 2016.His associates say “nothing political” was discussed.Schiff’s office told AFP he does not recall specifics of the discussion but they may have talked about “Saudi Arabia generally”.“Those who pushed for this arrest gravely misread US politics,” Kirsten Fontenrose, a former White House official responsible for policy towards Saudi Arabia and now with the Atlantic Council, told AFP.“Jailing someone for meeting with a vocal Democrat will only make it more difficult for Trump to maintain close ties to the Saudi ruling family leading up to the US election. “And it will certainly come back to bite the kingdom if the next administration is led by Democrats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-game-of-thrones-pressure-grows-to-release-jailed-prince-salman-bin-abdulaziz/story-f8jEpvdJXhekjJ4iLP4OEK.html

Floyd died on May 25 in Minneapolis after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck until he stopped breathing. The officer was fired and charged with murder.The protesters in Auckland marched to the U.S. Consulate, where they kneeled. They held banners with slogans like “I can’t breathe” and “The real virus is racism.” Hundreds more joined the peaceful protests and vigils elsewhere in New Zealand, where Monday was a public holiday.In Iran, which has in the recent past violently put down nationwide demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access to the outside world, state television has repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest.Also read | Double whammy: After Covid-19, the US now grapples with protestsIranian foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi urged the U.S. government and police to stop the violence.“To American officials and police: Stop violence against your people and let them breathe,” Mousavi said at a news conference in Tehran on Monday. He also told the American people that “the world is standing with you.” He added that Iran is saddened to see “the violence the U.S. police have recently” set off.At a gathering in central London on Sunday, thousands offered support for American demonstrators, chanting “No justice! No peace!” and waving placards with the words “How many more?”In other places, too, demonstrators wove solidarity with the U.S. protesters with messages aimed at local authorities.In Brazil, hundreds of people protested crimes committed by the police against black people in Rio de Janeiro’s working-class neighborhoods, known as favelas. Police used tear gas to disperse them, with some demonstrators saying “I can’t breathe,” repeating Floyd’s own words.In Canada, an anti-racism protest degenerated into clashes between Montreal police and some demonstrators. Police declared the gathering illegal after they say projectiles were thrown at officers who responded with pepper spray and tear gas. Some windows were smashed and some fires were set.In authoritarian nations, the unrest became a chance to undermine U.S. criticism of their own situations. Iranian state television repeatedly aired images of the U.S. unrest. Russia said the United States had systemic human rights problems.And state-controlled media in China saw the protests through the prism of American views on Hong Kong’s anti-government demonstrations, which China has long said the U.S. encouraged. In a commentary, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that U.S. politicians might think twice before commenting again on Hong Kong, knowing “their words might backfire.”Also read | George Floyd protests: Flames engulf 200-year-old historic church near White HouseNorth Korea’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper on Monday reported about the demonstrations, saying that protesters “harshly condemned” a white policeman’s “lawless and brutal murder” of a black citizen.

Foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told reporters during a daily briefing that the international community disagreed with what he described as the selfish behaviour of the United States.“The U.S. has become addicted to quitting groups and scrapping treaties,” said Zhao. President Donald Trump announced on Friday the United States would cut ties with the WHO, accusing the UN. agency of becoming a puppet of China.The WHO has denied Trump’s assertions that it promoted Chinese “disinformation” about the virus.Trump’s decision came after a pledge by Chinese President Xi Jinping to give $2 billion to the WHO over the next two years to help combat the novel coronavirus, which emerged in China late last year.The EU on Saturday urged the United States to reconsider its decision.China calls on the international community to provide more political support and funding for the WHO, said Zhao. The US decision to quit the Geneva-based agency comes amid growing tension between the United States and China over the coronavirus outbreak.Since taking office, Trump has questioned the value of the United Nations and scorned the importance of multilateralism as he focuses on an “America First” agenda.He has quit the UN Human Rights Council, the UN cultural agency UNESCO, a global accord to tackle climate change, the Iran nuclear deal and opposed a UN migration pact.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-addicted-to-quitting-says-china-on-move-to-terminate-ties-with-who/story-ZFVsuxMfXPv47Itc94p8KL.html

He said the company behind the drug would manufacture enough to treat around 60,000 people a month.There is currently no vaccine for Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and human trials of several existing antiviral drugs have yet to show efficacy.A new antiviral drug from Gilead called remdesivir has shown some promise in small efficacy trials against Covid-19 and is being given to patients by some countries under compassionate or emergency use rules.Avifavir, known generically as favipiravir, was first developed in the late 1990s by a Japanese company later bought by Fujifilm as it moved into healthcare.RDIF head Kirill Dmitriev said Russian scientists had modified the drug to enhance it, and said Moscow would be ready to share the details of those modifications within two weeks.Also read | India’s Covid-19 tally surges beyond 190,500 with highest single-day spike of 8,392 casesJapan has been trialling the same drug, known there as Avigan. It has won plaudits from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and $128 million in government funding, but has yet to be approved for use.Avifavir appeared on a Russian government list of approved drugs on Saturday.ACCELERATED PROCESSDmitriev said clinical trials of the drug had been conducted involving 330 people, and had shown that it successfully treated the virus in most cases within four days.The trials were due to be concluded in around a week, he said, but the health ministry had given its approval for the drug’s use under a special accelerated process and manufacturing had begun in March.Clinical trials to test efficacy drugs usually take many months, even when expedited, and involve large numbers of patients randomly assigned who receive either the drug being trialled or a control or placebo.Success in small small-scale, early-stage trials is no guarantee of success in later, more comprehensive trials.A study published this month, for example, tied the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, which U.S. President Donald Trump says he has been taking and has urged others to use, to an increased risk of death in hospitalised Covid-19 patients.Also read | Coronavirus pandemic: Will it feel safe to fly this Summer?Dmitriev said Russia was able to cut testing timescales because the Japanese generic drug which Avifavir is based on was first registered in 2014 and had undergone significant testing before Russian specialists modified it.“We believe this is a game changer. It will reduce strain on the healthcare system, we’ll have fewer people getting into a critical condition,” said Dmitriev. “We believe that the drug is key to resuming full economic activity in Russia.”With 414,878 cases, Russia has the third highest number of infections in the world after Brazil and the United States, but has a relatively low official death toll of 4,855 - something that has been the focus of debate.RDIF, which has a 50% share in the drug’s manufacturer ChemRar, funded the trials and other work with its partners, to the tune of around 300 million roubles ($4.3 million), said Dmitriev, who explained that the costs to Russia were much lower because of previous development work conducted in Japan.Also read | Bodies left on hospital beds as coronavirus overwhelms Mumbai||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-update-russia-to-roll-out-its-first-approved-covid-19-drug-next-week/story-9V422benmGih9byWzPoC1O.html
01-06-2020||World||US will consider rejoining WHO if it ends corruption, reliance on China: White House||The US will consider rejoining the World Health Organization if it ends corruption and reliance on China, the White House has said.President Donald Trump on Friday terminated America’s relationship with the WHO and accused the global health body of being hand in glove with China in sharing inaccurate information to the world about the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 370,000 people globally.“The WHO needs to reform. What the president said, if the WHO reforms and ends the corruption and ends the reliance on China, the US will very seriously consider coming back,” US National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien told ABC News on Sunday.Also read | China says US action on Hong Kong ‘doomed to fail’The US has said that it will spend the money, over USD 400 million which it gives to the WHO, on other international public health bodies.“In the meantime, we’re going to take that USD 400 million that the US spends, compared to the USD 40 million that the Chinese spends on the WHO. And we’re going to make sure it gets to front-line health care workers, just like we’re doing with PEPFAR in Africa,” O’Brien said.“The WHO isn’t saving lives for AIDS and HIV victims in Africa. It’s the United States and our generous taxpayers who are saving those lives in Africa. We’re not doing it through the WHO. We’re doing it as the United States of America,” he said.“We’re going to take that same money and make sure it gets to the Doctors Without Borders and the Red Cross and the hospitals all over the world that need it, and doesn’t go through a corrupt international organisation that’s controlled by the Chinese Communist Party. That’s for sure,” O’Brien said.Appearing on the CNN on another Sunday talk show, O’Brien said that the US has got a series of measures to deal with China and the way they’ve choked out freedom in Hong Kong.“The president made a very important announcement on that front on Friday and the US government is looking at all of our relations with Hong Kong and China. So there will be a response and it will be proportional, but this is not something that our adversaries are going to get away with for free,” he added.

The authorities have conducted 561,136 tests, including 14,398 in the last 24 hours.The month of May registered nearly 52,000 new coronavirus cases as the tally surged from 69,474 to 17,699 cases, while the death toll rose from 408 to 1,483. Meanwhile, Prime Minister Imran Khan will chair a crucial meeting of the National Coordination Committee (NCC) which is expected to decide the future strategy to deal with the increasing threat of the pandemic on Monday.The meeting will discuss different options, including lockdown which was eased about two weeks ago.

On May 9, Pakistan began easing the month-long lockdown despite a steady rise in the number of the coronavirus cases. Prime Minister Khan had said that Pakistan would begin easing its nationwide lockdown in a phase-wise manner by allowing various businesses to open up, citing the economic crisis due to the shutdown, which was enforced in the country in March end.Pakistan on Friday announced the resumption of outbound international flights from Saturday, over two months after the services were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.

01-06-2020||World||Protests form across US demanding end to police violence||Protests formed across America again Sunday, even as glass and graffiti from the previous night’s unrest were still being cleaned up, with some violence and crime flaring in pockets of largely peaceful demonstrations fueled by the killings of black people at the hands of police.From Boston to San Francisco, protesters took to the streets once more, and some signs of trouble emerged in cities that have closed streets and imposed curfews after days of turmoil. People robbed stores in broad daylight in Philadelphia and Santa Monica, California, and a semitruck drove into a massive crowd of people that took over a portion of a highway in Minneapolis.It’s unclear if there were injuries. Protesters crawled on the truck, and police came in force to clear the highway in the city where the turbulence emerged after the death last week of George Floyd — a black man who pleaded that he couldn’t breathe after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes. The protests quickly became national, spreading to dozens of cities large and small.The officer who pressed his knee onto Floyd’s neck has been arrested and charged with murder, but protesters are demanding charges against all four officers at the scene. All four were fired.In neighboring St. Paul, thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol, pledging to keep up the protests.“We’re Minnesota nice, but we’re not Minnesota dumb, and we’re not done,” St. Paul Black Lives Matter organizer Darnella Wade said. “They sent us the military and we only asked them for arrests.”Minnesota’s governor brought in thousands of National Guard soldiers to help quell violence that had damaged or destroyed hundreds of buildings in Minneapolis over days of protests. The immense deployment appeared to have worked Saturday night, when there was comparatively little destruction.On Sunday, in a display of force, long lines of state patrolmen and National Guard soldiers were lined up in front of the Capitol, facing the demonstrators, with perhaps a dozen military-style armored vehicles behind them.Across America, demonstrators called again for an end to police violence.“They keep killing our people,” said Mahira Louis, 15, who marched with her mother and several hundred others through downtown Boston. “I’m so sick and tired of it.”Many also joined police in pleading for a stop to violence, saying it weakened calls for justice and reform.“It only hurts the cause,” said Danielle Outlaw, head of the police force in Philadelphia, where more than 200 people were arrested as fires and looting engulfed the heart of the city.Disgust over generations of racism in a country founded by slaveholders combined with a string of recent racially charged killings to stoke the anger. Adding to that was angst from months of lockdowns brought on by the coronavirus pandemic, which has disproportionately hurt communities of color, not only in terms of infections but in job losses and economic stress.The droves of people congregating for demonstrations threatened to trigger new outbreaks, a fact overshadowed by the boiling tensions.“Maybe this country will get the memo that we are sick of police murdering unarmed black men,” said Lex Scott, founder of Black Lives Matter Utah. “Maybe the next time a white police officer decides to pull the trigger, he will picture cities burning.”The scale of the protests, sweeping from coast to coast and unfolding on a single night, rivaled the historic demonstrations of the civil rights and Vietnam War eras.Curfews were imposed in major cities around the U.S., including Atlanta, Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Seattle. About 5,000 National Guard soldiers and airmen were activated in 15 states and Washington, D.C.At the Minneapolis intersection where Floyd was killed, people gathered with brooms and flowers, saying it was important to protect what they called a “sacred space.” The intersection was blocked with the traffic cones while a ring of flowers was laid out.Among those descending on Minneapolis was Michael Brown Sr., the father of Michael Brown, whose killing by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, set off unrest in 2014.“I understand what this family is feeling. I understand what this community is feeling,” he said.County Commissioner Angela Conley said the demonstrations and confrontations with police would continue until the other three officers who were at the scene when Floyd was pinned down are arrested and prosecuted. The officer who held his knee on Floyd’s neck, Derek Chauvin, was charged last week with murder. All four officers have been fired.“We’ll continue to have this militarized presence in our community until justice is done,” Conley said.In tweets Sunday, President Donald Trump blamed anarchists and the media for fueling the violence. Attorney General William Barr pointed a finger at “far left extremist” groups. Police chiefs and politicians accused outsiders of coming in and causing the problems.The fury also spread to Europe, where thousands gathered in London’s Trafalgar Square, clapping and waving placards despite government rules barring crowds because of the COVID-19 pandemic.In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days.Buildings around the U.S. were defaced with spray-painted messages, from the facade of St. Patrick’s Cathedral in New York to the historic Hay-Adams hotel near the White House. Some of Floyd’s gasped last words — “I can’t breathe” — were repeated, alongside anti-police messages.Crews near the White House worked to replace windows that had been shattered with large pieces of wood. Buildings for blocks were marked with graffiti, including curses about Trump. Shattered glass still covered the sidewalks. The damaged buildings included the Department of Veterans Affairs, directly across the street from the White House.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-form-across-us-demanding-end-to-police-violence/story-5b8EVhnYCe7jMI8cwDXYOO.html
01-06-2020||World||Trump rushed into White House bunker by Secret Service as protests raged: Report||Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades.Trump spent nearly an hour in the bunker, which was designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also spoke on condition of anonymity.The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from protesters in Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds.Friday’s protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. The demonstrations in Washington turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 .“The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. The president’s move to the bunker was first reported by The New York Times.The president and his family have been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, according to the Republican. It was not immediately clear if first lady Melania Trump and the couple’s 14-year-old son, Barron, joined the president in the bunker. Secret Service protocol would have called for all those under the agency’s protection to be in the underground shelter.Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service.Trump traveled to Florida on Saturday to view the first manned space launch from the U.S. in nearly a decade. He returned to a White House under virtual siege, with protesters — some violent — gathered just a few hundred yards away through much of the night.Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening.Trump continued his effort to project strength, using a series of inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks during a time of national crisis.As cities burned night after night and images of violence dominated television coverage, Trump’s advisers discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president’s own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity.Trump did not appear in public on Sunday. Instead, a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time said Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators.On Sunday, Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force.“This isn’t going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,” Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president.In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the U.S. Park Police.On Sunday, the Justice Department deployed members of the U.S. Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rushed-into-white-house-bunker-by-secret-service-as-protests-raged-report/story-EolKzmlQZPbxwS1amcKuPM.html
01-06-2020||World||George Floyd protests: Flames engulf 200-year-old historic church near White House||An over 200-year-old historic St John’s church near White House has been vandalised and set on fire as protests over the death of George Floyd escalated into rioting and multiple fires seen in Washington and other US cities.“This church has been standing in our city since the early 1800s. Please avoid the area,” the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) of the District of Columbia said on Twitter.Firefighters quickly extinguished the basement fire, which police said was intentionally set. The MPD said it is currently responding to multiple fires intentionally set in Washington D.C and its suburban neighbourhoods.Protestors were also seen pulling down a flag from the landmark that opened in the year 1816 and popularly nicknamed the “Church of the Presidents” as beginning with James Madison, every president has been an occasional attendee of services.In Washington, Fox News cameras were rolling as flames erupted in the newly renovated basement of the St. John’s Church parish house; it was unclear exactly how the fire started or how much damage had been done to the church.A senior official said more than 50 Secret Service officers have been injured so far Sunday night, with the numbers expected to worsen, as rioters hurled bottles and Molotov cocktails.There were protests in the area all day, and protesters set several fires on Sunday evening.According to the Washington Post, in Georgetown and elsewhere in America’s capital city, people spent the afternoon hammering plywood boards outside retail shops and restaurants in the hopes their businesses would escape the attacks that others a day earlier did not. American flags and parked cars and buildings were lit ablaze.The city is now under curfew, which went into effect at 11 p.m. (local time) and will be active until 6 a.m. on Monday.The scale of the protests spanned from San Francisco to Boston and unfolding on a single night.More than two dozen mayors and governors have imposed curfews, a level not seen the unrest following the 1968 assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., The New York Times reported.In Indianapolis, two people were reported dead in bursts of downtown violence, adding to deaths reported in Detroit and Minneapolis in recent days.Earlier Sunday, people robbed stores in broad daylight in Philadelphia and Santa Monica, California, and a driver sped a semitrailer toward a massive crowd of people assembled on a highway in Minneapolis -- but remarkably, there were no initial reports of anyone hurt aside from that driver.In neighbouring St. Paul, thousands gathered peacefully in front of the state Capitol, pledging to keep up the protests.The National Guard’s top general on Sunday said Guard units in nearly half of US states have been mobilized to help major cities deal with the riots. Gen. Joseph Lengyel said some 16,000 additional Guard troops have been deployed to 24 states and the District of Columbia in response to civil disturbances.Floyd died Monday after a Derek Chauvin, a white Minneapolis police officer, pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck. The officer has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter; he and three other officers were fired from the force after a video of Floyd’s death emerged.Riots erupted from demonstrations in cities from San Francisco to Boston protesting the death of Floyd.The latest deployment brought the total number of deployed National Guard members to about 62,000 across the country. Other Guard members already had been deployed to assist with their governments’ COVID-19 relief efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-protests-flames-engulf-200-year-old-historic-church-near-white-house/story-tBavOiPI7Mu4yUsphhx4EM.html
01-06-2020||World||Trump’s prospect for re-election slips over negative Covid ratings, poll suggests||Donald Trump’s prospect for re-election expected to be held in November seems to be eroding as Americans give negative ratings to the US President for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, the blowback of which continues to persist on the economy as well as on the daily lives of the people, in comparison to his rival and former vice president Joe Biden who now enjoys a clear lead nationally, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOverall, Americans offer mixed assessments of Trump and Biden, and although the presumptive Democratic nominee is viewed less favourably overall today than he was last fall, he fares better than the president on several personal attributes.At the same time, Trump’s supporters are notably more enthusiastic and committed to voting for him in the fall than are those who currently back Biden, said the Post-ABC poll, conducted between May 25-28 over phone among a random national sample of 1,001 adults.Biden leads Trump with 53 per cent to 43 per cent among registered voters nationally. That 10 percentage-point margin compares with what was a virtual dead heat between the two candidates two months ago when Biden was at 49 per cent and Trump 47 per cent. Among all adults, Biden’s margin widens to 13 points (53 per cent to 40 per cent).Against a rapidly changing backdrop -- with the coronavirus far from contained, the prospects for the economy remaining rocky as many businesses begin to reopen and violence convulsing cities across the nation -- the poll captures the moment. But it is not predictive as to the political fallout and implications for November, especially given the possible disparity between the popular vote and the electoral college results as was the case in 2016.Two months ago, Trump reached his highest approval rating in Post-ABC polls and for the first time he was in narrowly positive territory with 48 per cent approving to 46 per cent disapproving.The decline this time is also evident in assessments of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus crisis. Two months ago, as the nation was beginning to shutter itself to halt the spread of the virus, he was in positive territory, 51 per cent to 45 per cent. Today he has slipped to 46 per cent approving and 53 per cent disapproving.Trump’s stronger ratings in March were fueled in part by improved standing among some Democratic-leaning groups, some swing voters and also among women, signs of a rally effect that past presidents have experienced during national crises.That support has now receded, both on his handling of the pandemic and his overall rating. Among women, for example, approval on Trump’s handling of the virus has moved from an even split in March (48 per cent to 48 per cent disapproval) to significantly negative now (39 per cent positive to 59 per cent negative).On the economy, the president’s ratings are still in positive territory, at 52 per cent of Americans approving and 44 per cent disapproving. But that also reflects slippage since March, when he was net positive by 19 points.At a time when more than 40 million people have applied for unemployment insurance, the jobless rate in April was 14.7 per cent and some small businesses have been closed permanently, assessments of the economy have understandably turned sour.The poll also found that 34 per cent of Americans gave the economy a positive rating while 65 per cent offered a negative rating, including 24 per cent who offer the harshest verdict by saying the current state is “poor.”The Trump campaign has a huge financial advantage over Biden and is expected to use it to further sully his image in an attempt to re-create the circumstances that helped lead to Trump’s election in 2016.Democrats are counting on strong support from suburban voters, especially women, to help fuel a possible victory in November. Currently, suburbanites are more favourable toward Biden than they were toward Clinton in May 2016, with Biden at 50 per cent favourable compared with 38 per cent who were favourable toward Clinton then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-prospect-for-re-election-slips-over-negative-covid-ratings-poll-suggests/story-Y0sn6BwkHuE0PnWP8E5qHJ.html

Reports said it can be used to patrol the long border in high-altitude areas like Tibet.”The analysts said that the “...specially designed weapons have boosted the Chinese military’s combat capabilities in high-altitude regions, enabling it to better safeguard national sovereignty and territorial integrity”.For its first military exercise for 2020, which was held in January, the PLA’s Tibet military command had “...deployed helicopters, armoured vehicles, heavy artillery and anti-aircraft missiles across the region from Lhasa, capital of Tibet, with an elevation of 3,700 meters to border defense frontlines with elevations of more than 4,000 meters,” China Central Television had reported.Most of the disputed boundary between India and China falls in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR), whose international borders include Nepal and Bhutan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-rapidly-expanded-high-altitude-weapon-systems-after-doklam-standoff-says-report/story-4QudqVxXY2BCEf7NnRcbSK.html
01-06-2020||World||Double whammy: After Covid-19, the US now grapples with protests||The United States has been hardest hit by the coronavirus pandemic which started from Wuhan in China and quickly spread across the world. It has the highest number of Covid-19 cases - nearly 18 lakh - as well as the death toll.Many cities in the United States has seen the number of Covid-19 cases spike.And now, it is being singed by the protests against the killing of a black man. George Floyd was killed last Monday in Minneapolis when a police officer pinned him down and knelt on his neck; the man died gasping for breath.Since then, a wave of ‘I can’t breathe’ protests have swept across US cities with thousands coming on the streets and clashing with the police. These protests are once again resonating with the message ‘Black Lives Matter’.In Washington, protesters started fires near the White House as tensions with police mounted during a third straight night of demonstrations. They piled up road signs and plastic barriers and lit the raging fire in the middle of H Street. Others added branches pulled from trees.Enraged protesters screamed, “Who do you serve? Who do you protect?” Police shot pepper powders point black at several protesters.The accused police officer Derek Chauvin was first fired and then charged with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death.Nations around the world have watched in horror at the civil unrest in the United States. Burning cars and riot police in the US featured on newspaper front pages around the globe Sunday - bumping news of the Covid-19 pandemic to second-tier status in some places.Thousands gathered in central London on Sunday to offer support for American demonstrators. Chanting “No justice! No peace!” and waving placards with the words “How many more?” at Trafalgar Square, the protesters ignored UK government rules banning crowds because of the pandemic. Police didn’t stop them.Demonstrators then marched to the US Embassy, where a long line of officers surrounded the building. Several hundred milled around in the street and waved placards.Protesters in Denmark also converged on the US Embassy on Sunday. Participants carried placards with messages such as “Stop Killing Black People”.With 1,789,364 confirmed cases and 1,04,358 deaths, the US accounts for the highest number of infections and fatalities in the world, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Centre for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE).The total number of global coronavirus cases, meanwhile, has increased to over 6.1 million, while the deaths have surged to more than 3,71,000.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/double-whammy-after-covid-19-the-us-now-grapples-with-protests/story-OthKejetfceUYOQTiFsloO.html
01-06-2020||World||Spain PM to extend Coronavirus lockdown to June 21||Spain’s prime minister said on Sunday the country needed 15 more days of lockdown until June 21 “to finish with the pandemic once and for all”, and will ask parliament to approve a final two-week extension to the stay-home rule.“We have almost set out what we set out to do,” Pedro Sanchez told a press conference, as he expressed his intense relief that the number of new cases of Covid-19 in Spain, one of the nations hardest-hit by the virus, had fallen dramatically.From June 21, a national state of emergency will end and with it the lockdown, allowing citizens to move freely in their regions.From July 1, citizens will be able to move throughout the country. Spain’s death toll rose by two on Sunday to 27,127, the health ministry said, while the number of COVID-19 infections rose by 96 overnight to 239,429.Spain imposed a state of emergency on 14 March which involved a strict lockdown under which people could only leave their homes to buy food, seek medical care or for jobs where they could not work from home. Children were initially confined inside all day. Restrictions are being gradually eased. Despite opposition to the most recent lockdown extension from parties on the right and demonstrations across Spain, Sanchez has struck a deal with a Catalan separatist party Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) which should guarantee his minority government secures enough support to extend the lockdown. The current state of emergency is set to expire on June 7. Sanchez says this final stretch of the lockdown will include the handing back of control over health care to the regions that have shown the most progress in containing the virus.“We have almost reached safe harbour,” Sanchez said.The central government is slowing rolling back confinement measures depending on which areas have fewer infections and are better prepared for a possible second outbreak. The focus is now on maintaining the virus in check while reactivating an economy that Sanchez’s said will shrink by over 9% this year and take two years to recover.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-pm-to-extend-coronavirus-lockdown-to-june-21/story-NZIihASEcdG3vpTFhlAiMJ.html

They were inserted into the homes after public health authorities, especially in Quebec, were unable to cope with the emergency.Such homes house those most vulnerable to the disease, like the elderly or those with chronic conditions and debilities. In a letter posted online, Canada’s Chief of the Defence Staff General Jonathan Vance noted that this deployment has been designated a “special duty operation.” Canadian outlet CBC reported that it was expected that these soldiers will be eligible for “hazard pay.”Canadian Armed Forces or CAF realised the danger when they were first called in “given that our personnel would be operating in high risk environments and working in close proximity to residents who have tested positive or are exhibiting Covid-19 related symptoms”, a statement noted. There are 1,760 troops deployed at these facilities, of whom 1,475 are deployed at 23 homes in Quebec, beginning in April.Recent reports from the armed forces about the deplorable state of these homes has been in the headlines in the country.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has maintained that these troops will keep assisting in these nursing homes, though he also described this as a “stopgap” measure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-soldiers-on-covid-19-duty-to-get-benefits-like-soldiers-serving-abroad/story-MA7CKdLSRVj9CuuqHTnv6M.html

01-06-2020||World||Tear gas fired at protestors as clashes erupt outside White House||Police fired tear gas outside the White House late Sunday as major US cities were put under curfew to suppress rioting as anti-racism protestors again took to the streets to voice fury at police brutality.With the Trump administration branding instigators of six nights of rioting as domestic terrorists, there were more confrontations between protestors and police and fresh outbreaks of looting.Violent clashes erupted repeatedly in a small park next to the White House, with authorities using tear gas, pepper spray and flash bang grenades to disperse crowds who lit several large fires and damaged property.Local US leaders appealed to citizens to give constructive outlet to their rage over the death of an unarmed black man in Minneapolis, while night-time curfews were imposed in cities including Washington, Los Angeles and Houston.One closely watched protest was outside the state capitol in Minneapolis’ twin city of St. Paul, where several thousand people gathered before marching down a highway.“We have black sons, black brothers, black friends, we don’t want them to die. We are tired of this happening, this generation is not having it, we are tired of oppression,” said Muna Abdi, a 31-year-old black woman who joined the protest.“I want to make sure he stays alive,” she added in reference to her son, aged three. Hundreds of police and National Guard troops were deployed ahead of the protest.At one point, some of the protestors who had reached a bridge were forced to scramble for cover when a truck drove at speed after having apparently breached a barricade.The driver was later taken to hospital after the protestors hauled him from the vehicle, although there were no immediate reports of other casualties.There were other large-scale protests in cities including New York and Miami.Washington’s mayor ordered a curfew from 11:00 pm until 6:00 am, as a report in the New York Times said that President Donald Trump had been rushed by Secret Service agents into an underground bunker at the White House on Friday night during an earlier protest.Stores ransacked Large-scale violence has rocked many US cities in recent days, and looters ransacked stores in a neighborhood of Philadelphia on Sunday.In the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Monica, looting was reported at stores in a popular beachside shopping center.Officials in LA -- a city scarred by the 1992 riots over the police beating of Rodney King, an African-American man -- imposed a curfew from 4:00 pm Sunday until dawn.“Please, use your discretion and go early, go home, stay home and help us make sure that those who want to change this conversation from being about racial justice to be about burning things and looting things, don’t win the day,” the city’s mayor Eric Garcetti said on CNN.The shocking videotaped death last Monday of an unarmed black man, George Floyd, at the hands of police in Minneapolis ignited the nationwide wave of outrage over law enforcement’s repeated use of lethal force against unarmed African Americans.Floyd stopped breathing after Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.Chauvin has been charged with third-degree murder and is due to make his first appearance in court on Monday. Three other officers with him have been fired but for now face no charges.Governor Tim Walz has mobilized all of Minnesota’s National Guard troops -- the state guard’s biggest mobilization ever -- to help restore order.Police fired tear gas and stun grenades to clear streets of curfew violators Saturday night in Minneapolis.Walz extended a curfew for a third night Sunday and praised police and guardsmen for holding down violence. “They did so in a professional manner. They did so without a single loss of life and minimal property damage,” he said.“Congratulations to our National Guard for the great job they did immediately upon arriving in Minneapolis, Minnesota, last night,” President Donald Trump tweeted, adding that they “should be used in other States before it is too late!”The Department of Defense said that around 5,000 National Guard troops had been mobilized in 15 states as well as the capital Washington, with another 2,000 on standby.The widespread resort to uniformed National Guards units is rare, and it evoked disturbing memories of the rioting in US cities in 1967 and 1968 in a turbulent time of protest over racial and economic disparities. Trump blamed the extreme left for the violence, saying he planned to designate a group known as Antifa as a terrorist organization.“The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly,” added Attorney General Bill Barr.-A nation in pain’Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Trump, who has often urged police to use tough tactics, was not helping matters.“We are beyond a tipping point in this country, and his rhetoric only enflames that,” she said on CBS.Joe Biden, Trump’s likely Democratic opponent in November’s presidential election, visited the scene of one anti-racism protest.“We are a nation in pain right now, but we must not allow this pain to destroy us,” Biden tweeted, posting a picture of him speaking with an African-American family at the site where protesters had gathered in Delaware late Saturday.Floyd’s death has triggered protests beyond the United States, with hundreds rallying outside the US embassy in London in solidarity.“I’m here because I’m tired, I’m fed up with it. When does this stop?” Doreen Pierre told AFP at the protest.In Germany, England football international Jadon Sancho marked one of his three goals for Borussia Dortmund against Paderborn by lifting his jersey to reveal a T-shirt bearing the words “Justice for George Floyd”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tear-gas-fired-as-clashes-erupt-outside-white-house/story-dz30JkxDVwPXSNTnATQK7N.html
01-06-2020||World||Covid-19 impact: Canada’s GDP fell a record 11% in April||Canada’s national statistical agency has warned the country may have suffered a record decline in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the economic impact of the Covid-19 pandemic is being felt across all sectors.Statistics Canada, or StatCan as its popularly known, has estimated an 11 per cent fall in real GDP for April, following a 7.2 per cent drop in March. Real GDP is the gross domestic product corrected for inflation.While the April figure is based on preliminary information and will be revised once the final data is available, StatCan stated, “Nonetheless, the March and April decreases are likely to be the largest consecutive monthly declines on record.”It pointed out that out of 20 industrial sectors, 19 had decline and the only sector to show growth was non-durable manufacturing thanks largely to surges in food, beverage and tobacco products.“After the World Health Organization declared Covid-19 a pandemic on March 11, all levels of government in Canada put measures in place to slow its spread. Measures such as mandatory closures of non-essential businesses, schools and public institutions, and travel restrictions and physical distancing, combined with the closure of Canada’s international borders, affected all segments of the Canadian economy,” StatCan noted in a release.Canada will invest C$30 million ($21.8 million) to enable its provinces and territories to promote holidays in their “own back yard” because of the closure of the country’s borders due to the coronavirus pandemic.Canada, which has had more than 7,000 deaths due to COVID-19, has closed its borders to non-essential travel since March, and it is unclear when they will be opened again. Many provinces have also shut down domestic non-essential travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-impact-canada-s-gdp-fell-a-record-11-in-april/story-CDbc6ABxF8SLMtjsBvqxgK.html
01-06-2020||World||Trump took shelter in White House bunker as protests raged||Secret Service agents rushed President Donald Trump to a White House bunker on Friday night as hundreds of protesters gathered outside the executive mansion, some of them throwing rocks and tugging at police barricades.Trump spent nearly an hour in the bunker, which was designed for use in emergencies like terrorist attacks, according to a Republican close to the White House who was not authorized to publicly discuss private matters and spoke on condition of anonymity. The account was confirmed by an administration official who also on condition of anonymity.The abrupt decision by the agents underscored the rattled mood inside the White House, where the chants from protesters in Lafayette Park could be heard all weekend and Secret Service agents and law enforcement officers struggled to contain the crowds.Friday’s protests were triggered by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after he was pinned at the neck by a white Minneapolis police officer. The demonstrations in Washington turned violent and appeared to catch officers by surprise. They sparked one of the highest alerts on the White House complex since the Sept. 11 attacks in 2001 .“The White House does not comment on security protocols and decisions,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. The Secret Service said it does not discuss the means and methods of its protective operations. The president’s move to the bunker was first reported by The New York Times.The president and his family have been shaken by the size and venom of the crowds, according to the Republican. It was not immediately clear if first lady Melania Trump and the couple’s 14-year-old son, Barron, joined the president in the bunker. Secret Service protocol would have called for all those under the agency’s protection to be in the underground shelter.Trump has told advisers he worries about his safety, while both privately and publicly praising the work of the Secret Service.Trump traveled to Florida on Saturday to view the first manned space launch from the US in nearly a decade. He returned to a White House under virtual siege, with protesters — some violent — gathered just a few hundred yards away through much of the night.Demonstrators returned Sunday afternoon, facing off against police at Lafayette Park into the evening.Trump continued his effort to project strength, using a series of inflammatory tweets and delivering partisan attacks during a time of national crisis.As cities burned night after night and images of violence dominated television coverage, Trump’s advisers discussed the prospect of an Oval Office address in an attempt to ease tensions. The notion was quickly scrapped for lack of policy proposals and the president’s own seeming disinterest in delivering a message of unity.Trump did not appear in public on Sunday. Instead, a White House official who was not authorized to discuss the plans ahead of time said Trump was expected in the coming days to draw distinctions between the legitimate anger of peaceful protesters and the unacceptable actions of violent agitators.On Sunday, Trump retweeted a message from a conservative commentator encouraging authorities to respond with greater force.“This isn’t going to stop until the good guys are willing to use overwhelming force against the bad guys,” Buck Sexton wrote in a message amplified by the president.In recent days security at the White House has been reinforced by the National Guard and additional personnel from the Secret Service and the US Park Police.On Sunday, the Justice Department deployed members of the US Marshals Service and agents from the Drug Enforcement Administration to supplement National Guard troops outside the White House, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-took-shelter-in-white-house-bunker-as-protests-raged/story-uHK2zpfDRSx7TIGP5JtAbP.html

Violence is rapidly spreading over the killing of a black man last week by the US police official in Minneapolis. A video of the man, George Floyd, has been circulating which shows a US police officer kneeling on his neck and he gasping for breath. The protests have been hence been named ‘I can’t breathe’. Four police officials have been suspended but as Floyd’s video is spreading, so are the protests.Also read: Trump took shelter in White House bunker as protests ragedThe protests have prompted major cities to impose curfews.Civil unrest has swelled following Monday’s death of George Floyd. The National Guard said on Sunday that 5,000 soldiers and airmen had been activated in 15 states and Washington, DC, but that “state and local law enforcement agencies remain responsible for security.”California Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency and deployed National Guard troops to Los Angeles after overnight protests that evoked memories of the 1992 riots over the police beating of Rodney King.Also read: Journalists covering US protests find themselves under attackThe governors of Virginia and New York said on Sunday they were placing their National Guards on standby amid protests in their states.Major US cities feared another night of violent protests on Sunday over the death of George Floyd in police custody, cleaning up broken glass and burned out cars after curfews failed to stop confrontations between activists and law enforcement.What began as peaceful demonstrations over the death of Floyd, who died as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck, have become a wave of outrage sweeping a politically and racially divided nation.Protesters have flooded streets after weeks of lockdowns during the coronavirus pandemic that threw millions out of work and hit minority communities especially hard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-photos-rage-and-anguish-from-george-floyd-protests-spreading-across-us-cities/story-II69bgSXTtzuqNdHr3giUK.html
01-06-2020||World||Trump invokes law-and-order to put protests against police brutality over Covid-19||President Donald Trump has seized on destructive nationwide protests against police brutality to portray himself as an icon of law and order, eschewing the soothing role past presidents have adopted in similar moments as he seeks to turn the election-year conversation from his widely panned handling of the coronavirus outbreak.The president on Sunday blamed the protests on Antifa, a loosely organized leftist movement that is a frequent target of conservative critics, and said he would declare the group to be terrorists. His political advisers believe the move pressures his re-election challenger, former Vice President Joe Biden, to either agree with the president -- splitting with the demonstrators -- or side with people that some White House officials regard as rioters.But in choosing to seize on calm the political and racial divisions inflamed by the death of an unarmed black man in Minneapolis police custody last week, the president risks alienating those U.S. voters looking for a leader who will console and unify. The coronavirus outbreak that Trump has sought to relegate to a back burner, meanwhile, continues to infect upwards of 1,000 Americans daily.By painting himself as a purveyor of law-and-order confronting political enemies he’s depicted as incompetent or crazed radicals, the president seeks to recreate the 2016 formula that put him in the White House, when the enthusiasm of Trump’s “forgotten Americans” overwhelmed a dispirited and divided center and left.But even some in Trump’s camp worry this may be one crisis too many for a president who has seemed to thrive on them. Even as the protests rage, voters are also enduring a coronavirus death toll that’s exceeded 100,000 and a U.S. economy in tatters.And people willing to take to the streets in the middle of a pandemic will surely show up to vote in November, one person close to Trump’s campaign fretted.Midnight StatementYet Biden has so far struggled to find his own footing on the protests that followed the death of George Floyd. His first substantive response to the demonstrations was a statement e-mailed to reporters after midnight Sunday morning.”It took two days of rioting across the country until Joe Biden finally released a statement, published after midnight this morning, to urge for an end to the violence,” Steve Guest, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, said in a statement on Sunday.Trump opted over the weekend against his own national address – a venue where he’s struggled before to demonstrate empathy. He instead limited his public remarks on the demonstrations that roiled cities across the nation to the preface of a speech in Florida celebrating the first launch of U.S. astronauts from U.S. soil since 2011.Rather than reaching for unity, Trump vowed to end “mob violence” and confront “radical left criminals.”On Twitter, the president declared he’d name demonstrators as members of a terrorist organization and threatened protesters near the White House with “vicious dogs” and “ominous weapons.” His critics said he was purposely evoking racist imagery from the civil rights protests of the last century, when police set dogs on African Americans and their allies.Trump said he would deploy the National Guard to communities where violence erupted and encouraged his supporters to convene for a counter-protest at the White House, all the while blaming the media and Democratic leaders for the strife.While the president offered public condolences and the promise of a targeted federal investigation into Floyd’s death -- the latest member of a tragic fraternity of unarmed black Americans who have died in interactions with police – the president signaled little appetite for the systemic changes demanded by protesters.He egged on law enforcement to react even more forcefully to violent protests and discounted alarm over images of police officers ramming demonstrators with vehicles. Trump defended the “overwhelming majority” of police on Saturday, saying they were “incredible in every way” – a sentiment echoed by his national security adviser on Sunday.“I don’t think there’s systemic racism,” Robert O’Brien told CNN. “I think 99.9% of our law enforcement officers are great Americans.”‘Not Constructive’But Floyd’s own brother criticized the president for not listening to his pleas for reforms in a phone call earlier in the week, telling MSNBC that Trump “didn’t give me an opportunity to even speak.”And Trump’s response drew concern from at least one ally, Senator Tim Scott, a South Carolina Republican. He said he had told Trump that some of his tweets on the protests were “not constructive.”“We talked about the fact that there is a constructive way to have a dialogue with a nation,” Scott, the only black Republican in the Senate, said in an interview with Fox News. He said the tenor of the conversation was similar to concerns he expressed to Trump in the aftermath of a 2017 white supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Virginia.But the president has shown throughout his political career – from his grievance-laden campaign to his reaction to Charlottesville, when he famously said there were “very fine people on both sides” – that he sees more advantage in voicing the sentiments of his narrow but electorally potent base of supporters than attempting national unity and healing.And the protests offer Trump another opportunity to try to shift focus from the coronavirus pandemic, which most Americans believe he has handled poorly, according to public polling. A majority of Americans – 53% - said in an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Sunday that they disapproved of Trump’s performanceSince the politically disastrous moment in April when Trump suggested Covid-19 might be treated with light or by injecting disinfectant into patients, Trump has looked to escalate tensions with China -- accusing the country of misleading the world over the pandemic. He’s also publicly sparred with MSNBC host Joe Scarborough, baselessly accusing him of murder while he was a congressman, and with Twitter after the social media company appended two of his tweets with fact-checking links.Trump EnthusiasmThere’s some evidence that Trump’s strategy may work. While the president trailed Biden by 10 percentage points in the same ABC News/Washington Post poll, the margin was halved when participants were limited to those who say they are certain to vote in November.And while 31% of Biden supporters say they are very enthusiastic about backing the Democrat, more than twice as many Trump supporters -- 64% -- say the same about the president. Those margins suggest Trump remains competitive despite disillusionment with his coronavirus response.And Trump’s allies believe Biden is poorly situated to exploit the Floyd protests.Less than two weeks ago, the former vice president was forced to apologize for his remark to a radio host that African Americans who haven’t decided to vote for him “ain’t black.” While Biden largely follows federal health authorities’ advice and remains home during the coronavirus pandemic, he has only been able to address civil unrest following Floyd’s death via a video message distributed by Twitter, prior to his Sunday morning statement.The president’s campaign on Sunday said Biden should be asked whether he supported Trump’s largely symbolic move to label Antifa a terrorist organization, suggesting the president hopes to either force the vice president to support his move -- or denounce protesters and risk further alienation with left-wing voters.But the president’s decision to increasingly align himself with police and against protesters carries risk as well. Trump’s re-election strategy relies on again winning at least one of Michigan, Ohio, or Pennsylvania. Major cities in each of those states saw significant anti-police brutality protests following Floyd’s death.And the president’s attacks on the Democratic leadership of Minnesota, as well as tweets seen as inflaming tensions on the streets of Minneapolis, may hurt him in a state his campaign had seen as a prime pick-up opportunity. Before the Floyd killing and unrest, Biden held a 5 percentage-point lead in the state, according to a May 25 poll published by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, Minnesota Public Radio and the local NBC affiliate, KARE 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-invokes-law-and-order-to-put-protests-against-police-brutality-over-pandemic/story-F9ITzw8Wg2RDyPrLiA2sOI.html
01-06-2020||World||Donald Trump says US designating Antifa as terrorist organisation for role in violence||US President Donald Trump on Sunday said that America is designating far-left extremist group Antifa as a terrorist organisation in view of its role in violence across the country after the killing of a black man by a white police officer in Minnesota.Antifa, regarded as a militant, left-wing, anti-fascist political activist movement in the US, comprises autonomous activist groups that aim to achieve their political objectives through the use of direct action rather than through policy reforms.“The United States of America will be designating Antifa as a terrorist organisation,” Trump said in a tweet.The Trump administration is blaming this far-left extremist group for the sudden spike in violent protests across the country after the brutal killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.“The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly,” Attorney General William P Barr said in a statement.The Trump administration alleges that it appears the violence is planned, organized and driven by anarchistic and far left extremists using Antifa-like tactics, many of whom travel from out of state to promote the violence.To identify criminal organisers and instigators, and to coordinate federal resources with state and local partners, federal law enforcement is using the existing network of 56 regional FBI Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTF), the Attorney General said.“With the rioting that is occurring in many of our cities around the country, the voices of peaceful and legitimate protests have been hijacked by violent radical elements. Groups of outside radicals and agitators are exploiting the situation to pursue their own separate, violent and extremist agenda.“It is time to stop watching the violence and to confront and stop it. The continued violence and destruction of property endangers the lives and livelihoods of others, and interferes with the rights of peaceful protestors, as well as all other citizens,” Barr said.It also undercuts the urgent work that needs to be done – through constructive engagement between affected communities and law enforcement leaders – to address legitimate grievances, he said.“Preventing reconciliation and driving us apart is the goal of these radical groups, and we cannot let them succeed,” Barr said.Appearing on a Sunday talk show, National Security Advisor Robert O’Brien told CNN that the president and the attorney general want to know from the FBI what they have been doing to track, dismantle, surveil and prosecute Antifa.“And if that hasn’t been happening, we want to know what the plan is going forward. These Antifa militant radicals who come into our cities and cross state lines, and they’re organised, and use Molotov cocktails and fireworks, and gas to burn down our cities, especially businesses in minority neighbourhoods, it’s got to be stopped,” he said.The violence, he alleged, has been driven by Antifa.“They did it in Seattle. They have done it in Portland. They have done it in Berkeley. This is a destructive force of radicals -- I don’t even know if we want to call them leftists. Whatever they are, they’re militants who are coming in and burning our cities, and we’re going to get to the bottom of it,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-us-designating-antifa-as-terrorist-organisation-for-role-in-violence/story-PkafkBFrCjSZRU43O2wT5H.html
01-06-2020||World||Journalists covering US protests find themselves under attack||Journalists covering nationwide protests over the death of a black man at police hands in Minneapolis have found themselves under attack, by police and at times by protesters.The arrest and handcuffing Friday of a black CNN journalist by police in Minneapolis -- even as he was reporting live on camera following the death of George Floyd -- may have drawn the widest coverage. The journalist, Omar Jimenez, was released an hour later after the Minnesota governor personally intervened.But there have been several other serious incidents across the country, notably in Louisville, Kentucky, where a riot-squad policeman fired what appeared to be pepper-spray pellets at a local TV crew filming the scene.“I’m getting shot!” Kaitlin Rust, a reporter with local TV channel WAVE-3, cried out on camera. And in Minneapolis, freelance journalist Linda Tirado was struck in the left eye by a rubber bullet fired by police, and said later on Twitter that she had permanently lost vision in that eye.“Authorities in cities across the US need to instruct police not to target journalists and ensure they can report safely on the protests without fear of injury or retaliation,” said a statement from the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ).Members of the media have also come under attack by protesters. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, photographer Ian Smith said he was subjected to a beating until other demonstrators came to his defense.In Atlanta, the headquarters of news network CNN was attacked Friday by several dozen people. Someone in the crowd lobbed a flash grenade into the building’s lobby as police stood guard there.And on Saturday morning, a Fox News journalist who was reporting from a position in front of the White House was pummeled and chased by demonstrators until police intervened. “If you are a protester, do what you feel is right, but don’t stop us from doing what we know is the job we have to do for the public. Please do not target, intimidate, humiliate or block our efforts,” said a statement from the Society of Professional Journalists (SPJ). President Donald Trump has frequently targeted the news media as a source of what he calls “fake news,” claiming without evidence that the media invent stories intended to harm him.Following the attack on the CNN building in Atlanta, the president retweeted a supporter’s post that seemed to gloat about the incident: “In an ironic twist of fate, CNN HQ is being attacked by the very riots they promoted as noble & just. Oops.”He has regularly denounced the press as “enemies of the people,” and has often singled out CNN as a favorite target.Media critics and commentators say such language can have the effect, at least among fringe elements, of encouraging violence against journalists.tu/bbk/jm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/journalists-covering-us-protests-find-themselves-under-attack/story-9xfAs4lfi8DwZHba2bx7WP.html
01-06-2020||World||Islamic State claims responsibility for Afghan bus attack||The Islamic State group took responsibility Sunday for a deadly roadside bombing against a bus belonging to a local TV station in the Afghan capital, while renewed fighting in nearby provinces killed at least seven civilians, including a woman and several children.In a statement on an IS-affiliated website, the group said Saturday’s attack in Kabul targeted a bus carrying employees of Khurshid TV, a station it described as “loyal to the Afghan apostate government.”Two employees were killed and four wounded, said Marwa Amini, the Interior Ministry deputy spokeswoman. Two of the wounded were in critical condition Sunday, said Mohammad Rafi Sediqi, an official at the station.Both the Taliban and the Islamic State are active in Kabul. IS has claimed recent attacks on civilian targets, while the Taliban has taken responsibility for attacking military targets. IS has been increasingly active in Afghanistan after suffering battlefield losses in recent months to government and US forces, as well as its Taliban rivals.Another roadside bomb exploded in Kabul on Sunday as a police patrol was passing by, wounding three civilians, said Tariq Arian, the Interior Ministry spokesman. No one immediately claimed responsibly for the blast.The attacks come after a truce expired between the Taliban and Afghan security forces for the three-day Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which ended Tuesday. The Taliban have claimed only one attack since then, and neither the Taliban insurgents nor the government appear to want a return to all-out fighting.However, renewed violence elsewhere in the country killed at least seven civilians on Saturday, officials said.A mortar shell fired by Afghan forces killed at least four civilians when it hit a home in Maidan Wardak province, said Wahidullah Akberzia, a provincial council member. He said the Afghan convoy had come under attack from the village late Saturday and fired back, resulting in the civilian deaths, which included a woman and three children.Local civilians protested the killings by carrying the bodies to the governor’s office on Sunday “to demand justice from the government,” Akberzia said, adding that two children had also been wounded. Maidan Wardak province borders Kabul to the west.Separately, at least three small children were killed Saturday when a mortar shell hit their home in Parwan province, said Wahida Shahkar, a spokeswoman for the provincial governor.Shahkar blamed the Taliban for the attack, but the Taliban denied involvement. Parwan province lies just north of the capital.In an apparent effort to resuscitate the flagging peace agreement signed between the US and Taliban in February, hundreds of Taliban prisoners were released by the government last week, and the Taliban made a reciprocal release of government personnel. The exchange of prisoners was seen as a goodwill gesture before the start of intra-Afghan negotiations between the Taliban and Kabul’s political leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/islamic-state-claims-responsibility-for-afghan-bus-attack/story-lXM87HLJWLsvQ1J92NHpJN.html
01-06-2020||World||‘I can’t breathe’ protests heat up as curfews imposed in several US cities||Civil unrest flared and curfews were imposed in several major US cities on Saturday as demonstrators took to the streets to vent outrage at the death of a black man shown on video gasping for breath as a white Minneapolis policeman knelt on his neck.From Los Angeles to Miami to Chicago, protests marked by chants of “I can’t breathe” - a rallying cry echoing the dying words of George Floyd - began peacefully before turning unruly as demonstrators blocked traffic, set fires and clashed with riot police, some firing tear gas and plastic bullets in an effort to restore order.The sight of protesters flooding streets fueled a sense of crisis in the United States after weeks of lockdowns due to the coronavirus pandemic, which has seen millions thrown out of work and has disproportionately affected minority communities. Also Watch | Trump calls George Floyd’s death ‘grave tragedy’, vows to stop mob violenceIn the nation’s capital, hundreds of demonstrators assembled near the Justice Department headquarters shouting, “black lives matter.” Many later moved to the White House, where they faced off with shield-carrying police, some mounted on horseback.President Donald Trump said on Saturday that if protesters who gathered the night before in Lafayette Square, across from the White House, had breached the fence, “they would have been greeted with the most vicious dogs, and most ominous weapons, I have ever seen.”The full Minnesota National Guard was activated for the first time since World War Two after four nights of arson, looting and vandalism in parts of Minneapolis, the state’s largest city, and its adjacent capital, St. Paul.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said the deployment was necessary because outside agitators were using protests over Floyd’s death to sow chaos.“We are under assault,” Walz, a first-term governor elected from Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, told a briefing on Saturday. “Order needs to be restored.”Separately, US Attorney General William Barr also pointed the finger at extremist instigators, though he and Walz - neither offering evidence to support their assertions - suggested opposite ends of the political fringe were to blame. NATIONAL DISCONTENT REFLECTEDCivil rights activists said video of Floyd’s arrest on Monday - captured by an onlooker’s cellphone as he repeatedly groaned, “please, I can’t breathe” before he died - triggered an outpouring of rage long simmering over persistent racial bias in the US criminal justice system. But the rapidly spreading protests also coincided with a deep-seated national discontent over the social claustrophobia and economic carnage wrought by the coronavirus pandemic.In a surreal moment for Miami on Saturday, police sirens and lights flooded downtown neighborhoods as fireworks began crackling and booming over Biscayne Bay to honor healthcare workers fighting the pandemic. Hundreds of police in riot gear swarmed the area, threatening to arrest anyone, including media, who ventured onto the streets.Curfews were imposed in several major cities rocked by civil disturbances in recent days, including Atlanta, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Denver, Cincinnati, Portland, Oregon, and Louisville, Kentucky. Protests also flared on Saturday in Dallas, Chicago, Seattle, Salt Lake City and Cleveland.In an extraordinary move, the Pentagon said it put military units on a four-hour alert to be ready if requested by the Minnesota governor to help keep the peace.National Guard units also were mobilized by the governors of Ohio, Missouri, Wisconsin and Tennessee.The streets of Minneapolis were largely quiet during the day on Saturday. Several armored National Guard vehicles were seen rolling through town and authorities later closed major highways leading in and out of Minneapolis-St. Paul.At dusk, as the curfew went into effect, police confronted some 500 protesters milling around a burned-out bank and opened fire with tear gas and plastic bullets, sending the crowd scurrying. Tina Harrison, 32, gasping and coughing as she and two companions poured milk over their faces after being pepper-sprayed, insisted they were present to voice legitimate grievances as protesters, not to incite lawlessness.“We came here as white women ... to protect people of color,” Harrison said while they took cover inside an apartment lobby. It marked the fifth night of such clashes, the second since Friday’s announcement that Derek Chauvin, the policeman seen kneeling on Floyd’s neck, had been arrested on murder charges in Floyd’s death.Floyd, who had worked security for Minneapolis nightclubs, had been suspected of trying to pass counterfeit money to buy cigarettes on Monday evening. Police said he was unarmed. A store employee who had called for help had told a police dispatcher that the suspect appeared to be intoxicated. Three other officers dismissed on Tuesday from the police department with Chauvin, who was known to have worked off-duty security at one of the same nightclubs as Floyd, are also under criminal investigation in the case, prosecutors said. ‘COULD’VE KILLED THEM’Anger stoked by Floyd’s death was widespread. Thousands flooded Chicago streets for a second day of protests. Cellphone footage shared with Reuters showed an overturned SUV, a patrol car on fire, a person burning the American flag and a skirmish between demonstrators and police.In the Brooklyn borough of New York City, video footage recorded by onlookers showed a police squad car driving into a crowd of protesters during a second day of violence after more than 200 arrests were made on Friday.“They could’ve killed them, & we don’t know how many they injured,” US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez wrote on Twitter, demanding the NYPD officers be brought to justice.At a late-night news conference, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio suggested protesters were to blame.“The video was upsetting, and I wish the officers hadn’t done that,” de Blasio said. “But I also understood that they didn’t start the situation. The situation was started by a group of protesters converging on a police vehicle, attacking that vehicle.”The mayor said flare-ups of violence were primarily instigated by small numbers of outsiders determined to goad police into confrontations, a phenomenon authorities said was playing out across the country.Protesters in Los Angeles clashed with police in the city’s Fairfax district, where crowds tried to force their way into the CBS Television City studios but were repulsed by law enforcement and security officers, the Los Angeles Times said.Looters broke into stores at The Grove shopping center in Fairfax, TV reported, as well as into shops along the famed Rodeo Drive of wealthy Beverly Hills.Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garnett told reporters, “This is no longer a protest. This is vandalism ... this is destruction.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-can-t-breathe-protests-heat-up-as-curfews-imposed-in-several-us-cities/story-4dD7qjNMo3Jc0I6Q2YriaI.html
01-06-2020||World||Trump calls for expanding G-7 to include India, 3 others; postpones next meet||President Donald Trump on Saturday called for expanding the G-7, which he described as a “very outdated group”, to include India, Australia, South Korea and Russia, suggesting it could be called the “G-10 or G-11”. He also said he is postponing its next meet, which the US is hosting, to September or November,.“I’m postponing it because I don’t feel that as a G7 it properly represents what’s going on in the world,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One on the way back from the historic launch of the first manned mission into space by a private company, SpaceX. “It’s a very outdated group of countries.”“We want Australia, we want India, we want South Korea. And what do we have? That’s a nice group of countries right there,” he said, skipping Russia. But he appeared to have suggested inviting Russia as well, according to a report from a pool of reporters that traveled with him.The president went on to describe the expanded group as the “G-10 or G-11”, and added, he had “roughly” discussed the idea with the leaders of the four countries he’d like to add. The Group of Seven, as the G-7 expands to, is an intergovernmental organization of some of the world’s largest economies, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. India is a member of the larger version of the body that is called the G-20.An aide to the president said the plan is to bring together all traditional allies to discuss how to deal with the future of China.Trump has called before for Russia to be readmitted to the group, arguing, as he did before the 2019 summit in Biarritz, “because a lot of the things we talk about have to do with Russia”. But this is probably the first time any of the G-7 member countries has called for including India or the other three named by Trump.The US president had pressed the G-7 heads of state and government at a dinner during the Biarritz summit to readmit Russia. Only Italy had backed him, according to The Guardian. Japan was neutral. France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Canada had pushed back forcefully.Prime Minister Narendra Modi had attended the Biarritz at the invitation of the host, French President Emmanuel Macro. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had attended a meeting of the body in Gleneagles, Scotland in 2005 at the invitation of then British Prime Minister Tony Blair.The group was then called the G-8 with Russia as the eighth member. Russia was expelled by the group in 2014 for annexing Crimea.There was no clarity on the timing of the summit though. The American leader suggested it could take place in the weekend before or after the annual UN General Assembly meetings, which are scheduled to start on September 15 and end on September 22.But Trump indicated he was toying with other options as well. “Maybe I’ll do it after the election.,” he said. “Think a good time would be before the election.” US elections are due in November and he is running for a second term.“So it might be a G10, G11, and it could be after the election is over,” he added, leaving the question of dates wide open at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-plans-to-invite-india-to-g-7-meet-possibly-in-september/story-i84Le9m4hCgvknmjjMssyL.html
01-06-2020||World||With Kim Jong Un’s health status unclear, his uncle suddenly relevant after 40 yrs abroad||For about as long as North Korea has existed, Kim Pyong Il has been considered a possible successor to the throne. And now, with his nephew Kim Jong Un’s health status unclear, his name is being bandied about again.Kim Pyong Il, 65, is the last known surviving son of North Korea’s founder, Kim Il Sung. After losing out in the 1970s to his half-brother, Kim Jong Il -- who ended up running the country from 1994 to 2011 -- Kim Pyong Il spent about four decades overseas in diplomatic posts including in Hungary, Bulgaria, Finland, Poland and the Czech Republic before returning to Pyongyang last year.Although Kim Pyong Il has been effectively sidelined -- he was largely purged from state media and never developed enough power back home to mount a serious challenge for leadership -- some North Korea watchers say he could end up taking over from the 36-year-old Kim Jong Un, who hasn’t named a successor. This is mainly because he has Kim blood, and he’s a man. Also Watch | Donald Trump on Kim Jong Un’s health: ‘Have a very good idea but can’t talk about it’The conservative male leaders in Pyongyang would resist giving power to Kim Yo Jong -- Kim Jong Un’s younger sister who has been by his side helping to make policy the past few years -- according to Thae Yong Ho, who was North Korea’s deputy ambassador to the U.K. before he defected to South Korea in 2016. That’s due to her gender and relatively young age of 30.“The problem is that a Kim Yo Jong-led North Korea is unlikely to be sustainable,” Thae said, warning that collective leadership with her as the figurehead could lead to chaos. “To avoid this, some in the leadership would try to bring back Kim Pyong Il, who’s now under house arrest, to the center of the power.”Others don’t think Kim Pyong Il has a chance. South Korean ruling party lawmaker Kim Byeong-ki, a member of parliament’s intelligence committee, said Sunday on social media that there was no indication he could possibly succeed Kim Jong Un if the leader were incapacitated: “I laugh off these theories.”North Korea has often exiled those who fall out of favor, sending them aboard in attempts to erase their influence, but also providing a financial lifeline that keeps them dependent on Pyongyang’s rulers.If Kim Pyong Il took power, it could put a great number of the current top leadership in jeopardy after they spent decades working to suppress his influence. When Kim Jong Un took power after his father’s death in 2011, he soon eliminated potential rivals: He executed his uncle and one-time deputy, Jang Song Thaek, and was suspected to have ordered the assassination of his exiled older half-brother, Kim Jong Nam, in Malaysia.The fact that Kim Pyong Il survived the purges in the ruling family may indicate that Kim Jong Un never saw him as a credible rival, keeping him in the foreign service and at arm’s length for years. In 2015, he was named North Korea’s ambassador to the Czech Republic and was given extra protection in 2017 when Kim Jong Nam was murdered.‘A Much Freer Life’Kim Pyong Il kept a low profile while he was in Europe, though he still made an impression. Lubomir Zaoralek, who was the Czech Republic’s foreign affairs minister from 2014 through 2017, said “his style and manner were as if he had come from South Korea.”“You could see that he was established in Europe and that he has lived his life here,” Zaoralek said. “He was always careful in what he had to say, but it always made perfect sense. And it seemed that he lived a much freer life here than other North Koreans.”Kim Pyong Il returned to Pyongyang last November, so that Kim Jong Un could keep a closer watch on him, the JoongAng Ilbo newspaper reported, citing intelligence sources.He has been the subject of speculation for decades in South Korea in unverified reports about family intrigue, often including house arrests and attempted assassinations. Before his years abroad, he served in the army, commanding an elite body guard unit, and also was appointed to posts in the ruling party, according to the South Korean Unification Ministry.Gender QuestionHis mother Kim Song Ae -- the second wife of the state founder -- was influential in the 1970s and pushed for Kim Pyong Il to take power. But she soon fell out of favor after Kim Jong Il was named successor.Kim Pyong Il is largely seen as a contender this time by those who discount Kim Yo Jong due to her age and gender, according to Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former North Korea analyst with the U.S. government.“It is highly unlikely that he has the connections or the support base he needs to be the next North Korean leader,” she said. “Kim Yo Jong has a special status in the regime, and I think in this case, her connection to the Kim family trumps her gender.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-kim-jong-un-s-health-status-unclear-his-uncle-suddenly-relevant-after-40-yrs-abroad/story-XeHq2W1dCrZ3nG4kBZ1EGM.html
