In England, Premier League soccer players including champions Manchester City took a knee before kickoff in support of the “Black Lives Matter” movement when the season restarted on Wednesday.Raab, asked if he would adopt the position during a TalkRadio interview on Thursday, said he understood the sense of frustration and restlessness driving the Black Lives Matter movement. He added: “I’ve got to say on this ‘taking the knee’ thing, which I don’t know, maybe it’s got a broader history but it seems to be taken from the Game of Thrones. “It feels to me like a symbol of subjugation and subordination rather than one of liberation and emancipation. But I understand people feel differently about it so it’s a matter of personal choice.” Asked again if he would take a knee to protest, he said: “I take the knee for two people, the queen and the missus when I asked her to marry me.”In “Game of Thrones”, the phrase “bending the knee” is used when someone pledges fealty to a monarch or lord.Raab later tried to clarify his remarks, saying he had “full respect” for the Black Lives Matter movement.“If people wish to take a knee, that’s their choice and I respect it. We all need to come together to tackle any discrimination and social injustice,” he said on Twitter. A clip of Raab’s interview attracted 1.5 million views on Twitter within hours of it being posted and opposition lawmakers were highly critical of his words.“This is not just insulting to the Black Lives Matter movement, it is deeply embarrassing for Dominic Raab,” David Lammy, the justice spokesman for the Labour Party and a longtime black rights campaigner, said on Twitter.“He is supposed to be the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taking-the-knee-seems-to-be-from-game-of-thrones-says-uk-foreign-minister/story-hmBB1b3pP5bDq6LlBaQurL.html

The order does not prevent future attempts though.“We do not decide whether DACA or its rescission are sound policies,” Roberts said. “We address only whether the agency complied with the procedural requirement that it provide a reasoned explanation for its action. Here the agency failed to consider the conspicuous issues of whether to retain forbearance and what if anything to do about the hardship to DACA recipients.”President Barack Obama had issued the protection through an executive order in 2012 barring the deportation of undocumented immigrants who came here as children. Called the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), the Trump administration rescinded it in November 2017. But it was blocked from going into effect by lower courts, and now by the highest court in the country.The US citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) has said there are an estimated 699,350 DACA recipients, also called Dreamers, protected by DACA. The United States has told India at least 2,550 of them are from India.India raised the issue of DACA Indians with the Trump administration along with the tightening of rules for H-1B non-immigrant visa for specialized professionals.There is broad bipartisan support for DACA recipients among lawmakers and and Republican have worked closely with Democrats to try to finds a long-term solution, to find a clear path from them to stay on become citizens. Polls have also found widespread support for them among Americans.This was a second ruling in a week by the conservative court that has gone against the Trump administration. On Monday, Neil Gorsuch, aTrump appointee, joined the chief justice, also a conservative, and the bench’s four liberal justices to extend workplace protections from discrimination under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the LGBTQ community.President Donald Trump lashed out at the court in an angry tweet. “These horrible & politically charged decisions coming out of the Supreme Court are shotgun blasts into the face of people that are proud to call themselves Republicans or Conservatives.” “Do you get the impression that the Supreme Court doesn’t like me?” he asked in a a follow-up tweet.Two of the nine justices are his appointees; the second is Brett Kavanaugh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-blocks-order-to-end-daca-many-indians-among-beneficiaries/story-5QnRMIwg5IipL4jupJFV3K.html
18-06-2020||World||‘Lot of asymptomatic cases’: Top China infection expert on Covid-19 cluster||The new cluster of Covid-19 infections in Beijing could have begun a month earlier than thought, a top infection expert has said as the capital on Thursday recorded 21 new cases, increasing the caseload to 158 in a week with nearly all the infections linked to a sprawling fresh food market in the southwestern Fengtai district.Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said the outbreak probably did not occur in early June or late May, but probably a month earlier.“A lot of asymptomatic or mild cases were detected in this outbreak and that is why the environment has such a large amount of virus,” Gao said at a seminar in Shanghai this week.According to Gao, who has been at the forefront of China’s fight against the coronavirus outbreak since it emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan, added that it will “…lurk in some dark, humid, polluted environments, which may be unexpected”.“After that, it will suddenly be exposed to many people within a certain period of time,” Gao said, adding this possibility needs further investigation.Since last week, Beijing, a city of around 21 million residents, has been gradually rolling out more restrictions after a cluster infection emerged from the Xinfadi wholesale market.The new cluster has again brought into focus hygiene levels in China’s food markets – it was to a seafood and meat market in Wuhan that the emergence of the pandemic was linked.“The epidemic is a mirror that not only reflects the dirty and messy aspects of wholesale markets but also their low-level management conditions,” the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said on Thursday.Local authorities have conducted more than 3.5 lakh nucleic acid tests since Saturday, have suspended flights, schools and gatherings in the capital city and fenced off dozens of residential communities to contain the new surge in infections, which are causing worry across the world about difficulties in tackling the pandemic.On Thursday, city authorities shut all hotels and restaurants in high-risk zones of Beijing.More than a thousand flights from two airports in Beijing were cancelled on Wednesday.The Beijing government has described the situation in the city as “grim”.The Beijing Municipal Bureau of Sports issued an urgent notice on Wednesday, suspending sports events as well as closing certain gyms as the capital city.According to the notice, all kinds of sports events will be suspended. Underground swimming pools and gyms will have to be closed.“Basketball, volleyball, football and other group sports are forbidden,” the official news agency, Xinhua, reported quoting the notice.The national health commission (NHC) has deployed in Beijing a team of experts with experience in fighting the outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the coronavirus first emerged late last year.The team will guide the local authorities in community management, tracing contacts and preventing the spread of the infection in hospitals.Overall, 28 confirmed cases were detected in the mainland on Wednesday, including four imported ones.North China’s Hebei province, bordering Beijing, reported two new Covid-19 cases and three asymptomatic patients on Wednesday, all of whom are related to the Beijing Xinfadi market.Beijing’s neighbouring city Tianjin reported one new covid-19 case on Wednesday night; that of a 22-year-old man working at Tianjin’s Conrad Hotel, according to Chinese state media.“The patient has been responsible for dishwashing since May 30, occasionally cleaning frozen seafood. All 93 close contacts have been quarantined for medical observation,” the state media report said.Following Beijing’s decision to raise its epidemic response to Level II from Level III on Tuesday, and after four provinces reported confirmed cases related to the capital city’s new outbreak, 31 provinces and regions in China have tightened health checks on arrivals from Beijing.At least one city, Harbin in northeast China, said arrivals from Beijing’s risk areas would have to go through a 14-day centralised quarantine, a week of home quarantine and four nucleic acid and one serum test during that period.Overall, China has recorded 83293 cases and 4634 deaths from the infection until Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lot-of-asymptomatic-cases-top-china-infection-expert-on-covid-19-cluster/story-zhU27u9xUy6Z4WfZ330zYJ.html

The ‘Rhodes Must Fall’ demand was raised in 2016 as part of similar campaigns on campuses in various countries to de-colonise curriculum and remove symbols of racism, imperialism and slave trade. It got a fillip with the Black Lives Matter (BLM) campaign.A wire mesh was put around the statue to prevent damage to it during the campaign in 2016, when a large number of students demonstrated to remove it. Rhodes and his background in colonialism and imperialism are seen as an unwelcome symbol in the modern era.Rhodes donated large sums of money to Oxford that includes the Rhodes Scholarship awarded to many bright students from across the world, including India.The college said that the governing body voted to launch an independent commission of inquiry into the key issues surrounding the Rhodes statue, and expressed their wish to remove the statue and the King Edward Street Plaque.“Both of these decisions were reached after a thoughtful period of debate and reflection and with the full awareness of the impact these decisions are likely to have in Britain and around the world”, the college said in a statement.The development comes in the context of recent demonstrations in Oxford, London, Bristol and elsewhere as part of the BLM campaign. The statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down in Bristol.The college added: “The commission will deal with the issue of the Rhodes legacy and how to improve access and attendance of BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) undergraduate, graduate students and faculty, together with a review of how the college’s 21st Century commitment to diversity can sit more easily with its past”.The commission, it said, will invite submissions from a broad range of stakeholders from Oxford and the UK; from representatives of the ‘Rhodes Must Fall’ campaign and the Oxford City Council, besides alumni and citizens.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-college-now-wants-cecil-rhodes-statue-to-go/story-VIRTdGJLeCKkppDQAtukEL.html

She was in colonial Calcutta for a week before going to the north-east.Over nine weeks in India, Lynn, considered the ‘voice of ENSA’, performed in over 100 shows, visited hospitals and autographed a large number of rupee-notes, scraps of paper and photographs of soldiers. In 1975, she was awarded the royal honour of ‘Dame’: the women’s equivalent of knighthood.Prime Minister Boris Johnson led tributes to Lynn: “Dame Vera Lynn’s charm and magical voice entranced and uplifted our country in some of our darkest hours. Her voice will live on to lift and hearts of generations to come”.Lynn recounted her experience of travelling in Myanmar in 1944 to The Guardian in 2017, when she turned 100: “Singing in the jungle was very hot and very sticky, which was a bit hard going. I had a little piano, which they trudged around on the back of a lorry, hoping it would survive the journeys”.“It wasn’t surprising that when I started singing, the piano had suffered and was slightly out of tune. To see the boys as they were brought into the casualty tents was very emotional. It cheered the parents up when they heard that I had been there. They thought it couldn’t be so bad.”Her records sold in the millions and for decades her songs remained on top of the charts, particularly The White Cliffs Of Dover, There’ll Always Be An England, I’ll Be Seeing You, Wishing and If Only I Had Wings.Lynn’s last public performance was in Trafalgar Square in 2005 during the 60th anniversary celebrations for VE Day (Victory in Europe Day), when she performed We’ll Meet Again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/war-time-singer-vera-lynn-who-visited-india-in-1944-dies-aged-103/story-OlO9Q4Zh2RCDDHUzHYpoXJ.html
18-06-2020||World||WHO official says malaria drug won’t stop coronavirus deaths||The World Health Organisation’s top scientist says it’s now been definitively proven that the cheap malaria drug hydroxychloroquine the drug favoured by President Donald Trump doesn’t work in stopping deaths among people hospitalized with the new coronavirus.But Dr. Soumya Swaminathan said there could still be a role for the drug in preventing people from catching Covid-19 in the first place and noted that clinical trials testing hydroxychloroquine’s role in this are ongoing.Swaminathan said in a press briefing on Thursday that there is still a gap in determining whether hydroxychloroquine has a role at all in prevention or minimizing the severity of the illness in early infection or even in preventing it.She says: “We don’t know that as yet. And we need to complete those large trials and get the data,” she said, referring to several other trials not being conducted by WHO. The UN health agency announced this week that it is suspending the hydroxychloroquine arm of its own trial testing various experimental therapies for Covid-19, referring to previous results from a large UK trial and a separate analysis of evidence on the drug.The other drugs being tested by WHO, including treatments used in the past for Ebola and AIDS, are still being pursued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-official-says-malaria-drug-won-t-stop-coronavirus-deaths/story-VYVZZAWsZqMQ1REsoyo7BM.html

The new China law also goes against Hong Kong Basic Law, G-7’s foreign ministers and the high representative of the EU said in a statement.The Boris Johnson government has responded strongly to Beijing’s move by announcing that if the law seen to curtail rights of Hong Kong citizens were implemented, it would offer holders of British National (Overseas) statue there a path to British citizenship.The statement said: “The proposed national security law would risk seriously undermining the ‘One Country, Two Systems’ principle and the territory’s high degree of autonomy. It would jeopardize the system which has allowed Hong Kong to flourish and made it a success over many years”.“We are also extremely concerned that this action would curtail and threaten the fundamental rights and freedoms of all the population protected by the rule of law and the existence of an independent justice system”, it added.Britain’s foreign secretary Dominic Raab said that statement showed the strength of international concern over the law. The G7 is calling on China to adhere to its legally binding international commitments and respect the autonomy and the freedom of the people of Hong Kong, he added.The statement was issued by the foreign ministers of the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the high representative of the EU.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g-7-eu-urge-china-to-reconsider-hong-kong-security-law/story-KxLM0fMYV4KmuMy7yqaC8M.html
18-06-2020||World||Covid-19 patients without disease symptoms may have weaker immune response: Study||Covid-19 patients who do not show any symptoms of the disease may have a weaker immune response to the virus, according to a new study which highlights the risks of using ‘immunity passports’ to certify that a person has recovered from Covid-19, and is fit for travel and work. The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, presents an analysis of the clinical and immunological manifestations of 37 asymptomatic patients infected with the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. It found that these patients had an average duration of viral shedding of 19 days, compared with 14 days in another group of 37 patients who showed symptoms of the disease. According to the scientists from the Chongqing Medical University in China, most people infected with SARS-CoV-2 experience a mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms that include fever, cough, and shortness of breath that may appear 2–14 days after exposure. However, they said several who test positive for the infection may either experience minor symptoms or be asymptomatic. In the study, the researchers studied 37 asymptomatic people diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2 infection from the Wanzhou district in China, before 10 April 2020. Of these asymptomatic patients from a group of 178 people with SARS-CoV-2 infection, 22 were female and 15 male, with ages ranging from 8 to 75 years, the scientists said. “In comparison to symptomatic patients, the asymptomatic group had a significantly longer duration of viral shedding, with a viral shedding time of 19 days,” they wrote in the study. According to the study, the levels of virus-specific immune system molecules called IgG antibodies were significantly lower in the asymptomatic group than in the symptomatic group during the acute phase of infection when the virus could be detected in the respiratory tract. Eight weeks after the patients were discharged from the hospital, the researchers said the levels of neutralising antibodies decreased in more than 8o per cent of asymptomatic patients, compared with about 62 per cent of symptomatic patients. They added that the asymptomatic patients also had lower levels of 18 pro- and anti-inflammatory cell-cell signalling proteins called cytokines. Based on these observations, the scientists believe that the asymptomatic patients may have had a weaker immune response to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The IgG antibody levels in the patients also began to diminish within three months of infection in a large proportion of the asymptomatic patients, the study noted. This finding, along with previous analyses of neutralising antibodies in patients recovering from COVID-19, highlights the potential risks of using ‘immunity passports,’ and supports the continuation of public-health interventions and widespread testing, the researchers said. They believe that further research in larger groups of symptomatic and asymptomatic patients is urgently needed to determine the duration of antibody-based immunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-patients-without-disease-symptoms-may-have-weaker-immune-response-study/story-Oxw1nHMFMSZ5x9KicMk2DL.html

As much as it’s going to be broken,” Trump told Sean Hannity in an interview on Fox News Wednesday night. “This is highly classified.”According to an excerpt of Bolton’s memoir published by the Wall Street Journal, Trump asked China’s leader, Xi Jinping, during the G-20 summit in Japan last year to help him win re-election by buying more US farm products.That accusation is one of many that paint a devastating portrait of the Trump presidency. Bolton, the most senior official in this White House to publish an account of his experience, also claimed that Trump encouraged Xi to build detention camps in the Xinjiang region to imprison hundreds of thousands of Uighur Muslims.In the Fox News interview, Trump retorted that Bolton had been a “washed up guy” when he brought him into the administration.“I gave him a chance, he couldn’t get Senate-confirmed, so I gave him a non-Senate confirmed position, where I could just put him there, see how he worked. And I wasn’t very enamored,” Trump said.Speaking to Hannity by telephone, the president said that “nobody has been tough on China and nobody has been tough on Russia like I have. And that’s in the record books and it’s not even close. The last administration did nothing on either.”The president lashed out at his former advisor in a tweet early Thursday morning, saying that the book “is made up of lies & fake stories” and that Bolton said “all good about me, in print, until the day I fired him.” Bolton has insisted that his departure last September was a resignation.On Wednesday evening, the Trump administration sought an emergency injunction from a federal court in Washington to stop publication of the book.The government argued that Bolton included classified information in the book and had failed to get approval. Administration lawyers asked for a preliminary injunction to block sales.“Disclosure of the manuscript will damage the national security of the United States,” the government said in the complaint.The injunction should “instruct his publisher to take any and all available steps to retrieve and destroy any copies of the book that may be in the possession of any third party,” the government said.Bolton’s explosive charges have already become an issue in the 2020 presidential campaign. Former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic nominee, said in a statement earlier Wednesday that “if these accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-accuses-john-bolton-of-breaking-law-with-his-memoir/story-NW7co6bpL37pvXZlxCW6CL.html

Washington withdrew from that pact.“During the exercises, short-range and long-range coast-to-sea and sea-to-sea missiles were successfully fired from the coast and from decks of ships, hitting their targets with great precision,” the semi-official Tasnim news agency reported.The new generation cruise missiles, with a range of 280 km (175 miles) were tested during exercises by the Iranian navy in the Gulf of Oman, which lies next to the Strait of Hormuz waterway at the mouth of the Gulf, and the northern Indian Ocean, Tasnim said.In April, Iran said it had increased the range of its naval missiles to 700 km.Western military analysts say Iran often exaggerates its weapons capabilities but concerns about its long-range ballistic missiles programme contributed to the U.S. decision to leave Iran’s 2015 deal to rein in its nuclear ambitions in exchange for an easing of economic sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-it-successfully-tests-new-naval-cruise-missile/story-3HYzDruvlGFJxvs2OXiQGN.html

It is expected to allow mainland security agents to be based in Hong Kong for the first time.The time frame for introducing the law is unclear, although some political analysts expect it will come in July, ahead of key elections in September.The South China Morning Post, quoting a mainland source familiar with Hong Kong affairs, said the law was unlikely to be passed during the parliament session in Beijing.Critics fear the legislation will crush wide-ranging freedoms in Hong Kong denied to people in mainland China that are seen as key to its success as a global financial centre.Authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong have dismissed fears that the law will curb freedoms and say it will only target a minority of “troublemakers” who pose a threat to national security.Despite such assurances, the legislation has triggered some of the strongest exchanges between officials in Beijing and Washington, with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo calling it a “death knell” for Hong Kong’s freedoms.Pompeo met China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Hawaii on Wednesday amid a deep deterioration of ties between the strategic rivals, their first face-to-face meeting since last year.The Chinese foreign ministry said in a statement Yang told Pompeo that the United States needed to respect China’s positions and halt interference in issues such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and the Xinjiang region and work to repair bilateral relations.Pompeo stressed “the need for fully-reciprocal dealings between the two nations across commercial, security, and diplomatic interactions”, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.On Wednesday, the G7 foreign ministers issued a joint statement calling on China not to follow through with its plans for the legislation.The law will be the biggest step yet by Beijing in a concerted campaign to assert its authority over the city and its 7.5 million people after months of often violent anti-government demonstrations.The legislation was not listed on an earlier agenda of the session of the National People’s Congress Standing Committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-china-parliament-body-to-review-hong-kong-security-legislation-report/story-A6iECqvElR3aCDi6edH6YO.html
18-06-2020||World||Tokyo governor seeks 2nd term, says Japan unprepared for pandemic||Japan may have contained its coronavirus outbreaks for now but the country needs better crisis management and a digital transformation to prepare for future shocks, Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike says.“We have to sort out the problems and start preparing now for a possible next wave,” Koike said in an interview with The Associated Press. “I will firmly strengthen the system.” Koike is favored to win a second term in a July 5 election after gaining respect for her proactive approach to controlling coronavirus outbreaks in Japan’s capital.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAs the pandemic deepened in the spring, Koike often upstaged fellow conservative Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, whose popularity has suffered from his handling of the crisis and its devastating impact on the economy, on top of a slew of scandals.Koike is viewed as a potential candidate to succeed Abe when his term ends in September 2021. For now, she says she’s focused on protecting Tokyo, a megacity with a $1 trillion economy.“Tackling coronavirus measures is an extremely big challenge, and it’s more important than anything else,” she said Wednesday on the eve of a 17-day campaign period for the election.Taking care not to criticise Abe directly, Koike said she had to coordinate with him to get things done by requesting help on the national level, implying she would have handled things differently.“There were times when Tokyo had to go ahead, in the spirit of encouraging the national government,” she said. “It is my mission to protect the lives and health of the 14 million people in the city and I was doing everything I could.” Among other things, Koike says Japan should have its own version of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in the U.S. to fight infectious diseases.She noted that despite the country’s high-tech image, as the pandemic took hold health centers were using fax machines to transmit medical data, slowing responses and information sharing. Although Japan has universal, relatively affordable health care and local health centers, unlike its neighbors it had not suffered major outbreaks of other infectious viruses such as SARS or MERS and was therefore unprepared to react quickly when cases began surfacing in January.The health ministry set up a nationwide online data sharing system only after Tokyo had to make major corrections of coronavirus cases numbers in May amid mishandling of data transmitted by faxes.Though Koike has not fully delivered on promises to Tokyoites to get rid of packed commuter trains, ensure adequate availability of child and elder care facilities and end overwork, even her critics laud her handling of the pandemic.Until late March, both Abe and Koike were insisting on the Tokyo Olympics would go ahead as planned in July. Once the games were postponed until July 2021, Koike began pushing for urgent measures to fight the pandemic and urged the government to declare a state of emergency. Abe appeared reluctant to do that, and has been accused of doing too little, too late.Koike led a group of local leaders urging Abe to move more aggressively, frequently visiting his office to negotiate over policy. She led the way in arranging for hotels to take in quarantine patients with no or slight symptoms to free up hospital beds to prevent a collapse of the overwhelmed medical system in the capital region.“Ms. Koike seems to have managed the coronavirus situation more smoothly than the national government,” said Ryosuke Nishida, a professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, though he noted their roles were different.Koike shares the same nationalist policy stance as Abe, but their relationship has been compared to the tug of war between President Donald Trump and New York’s Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whose state was ravaged by the pandemic.A TV newscaster-turned-politician, Koike is stylish and media savvy. A smooth talker who sounds decisive, like Cuomo she is articulate and to the point. She does not stray from facts, and she has one mission: to protect Tokyo.Also like Cuomo, at the height of the outbreaks she held daily updates on YouTube, capturing viewers’ attention with warnings about “explosions” of infections and the risks of the “3 Cs” — closed spaces, crowded places and close conversations.Koike also fought to get requests for a partial shutdown of businesses sooner.“Mr. Abe did not make any big mistakes, but his handling looked inferior” to Ms. Koike’s and some other local leaders,’ said Yu Uchiyama, University of Tokyo professor of political science. “Ms. Koike has high communication skills, but Mr. Abe does not.” Koike was an LDP lawmaker for nearly 20 years and has served in key Cabinet and ruling party posts, helping to crash what she’s described not as a glass ceiling for women in Japan but an “iron plate.” She was Japan’s first female defense minister and has held other Cabinet posts. After failing to win the LDP presidency she set her sights on becoming Tokyo’s first female governor, in July 2016.She earned the nickname “migratory bird” for hopping between parties and forming new alliances — at least seven times — in contrast with other Japanese politicians famous for their loyalty to party factions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-governor-seeks-2nd-term-says-japan-unprepared-for-pandemic/story-fBUaF4TSWilROwxE9U9uEP.html
18-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Venezuelans, other refugees face huge pandemic hardships, says UN||The head of the UN refugee agency says he is “very worried” about the impact of the coronavirus in Latin America, where millions of Venezuelans have fled upheaval at home and could face hardship abroad among lockdowns and other restrictive measures to fight the pandemic.UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said 164 countries have either partially or totally closed their borders to fight Covid-19. Many people who flee abroad rely on the “informal economy” often involving day work with cash wages — economic activities that are at risk as governments ratchet up coronavirus lockdowns.“Of course, it is good that countries are taking these measures of prudence” against the virus, Grandi said. “Unfortunately, Covid-19, which has been able to cause the entire world to grind to a halt, has not been able to stop wars, conflicts, violence, discrimination.”“People are still fleeing their countries to seek refuge, to seek protection. This needs to be considered,” he added, appealing to governments.The impact could be especially stark for 3.7 million Venezuelans abroad, the world’s second-largest refugee group after the 6.6 million Syrians displaced by their country’s war.The Americas right now have become the world’s epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic.“One region about which we’re very worried is, of course, Latin America and South America and in particular where countries host many millions of Venezuelans,” Grandi said in an interview. “They are particularly hit by Covid.”The comments came as UNHCR issued its annual “Global Trends” report, which found that the number of asylum-seekers, internally displaced people and refugees shot up by nearly 9 million people last year — the biggest rise in its records. That created a total of 79.5 million people, accounting for 1% of all humanity, seeking safety amid conflict, repression and upheaval.UNHCR chalked up the surge to a new way of counting people displaced from Venezuela and a “worrying” new displacement in the persistent trouble spots of Congo, the Sahel region of Africa, Yemen and Syria, which alone accounted for more than 13 million people on the move.While the total figure of people facing forced displacement rose from 70.8 million at the end of 2018, some 11 million people were “newly displaced” last year, with poorer countries among those most affected.UNHCR says forced displacement has nearly doubled from 41 million people in 2010, and five countries — Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Myanmar — are the source of nearly two-thirds of people displaced abroad.Grandi also noted about 30% to 40% of the world’s refugee population lives in camps. He said Covid-19 hasn’t affected “in dramatic numbers” camps like those in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh — a country that has taken in nearly a million Rohingya Muslims fleeing from Myanmar — or in Africa.Amid the outbreak, UNHCR has stepped up its “cash transfer” programs that put money directly in the pockets of displaced people. Grandi says 65 countries now benefit from such programs “and we have added 40 countries in just the last few months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-venezuelans-other-refugees-face-huge-pandemic-hardships-says-un/story-LdiDOLYpwvJjAecPI48gcL.html
18-06-2020||World||Panama canal sees 21% drop in crossings amid pandemic||The Panama Canal reported a 21% drop in the number of ships crossing the waterway in May, compared to projections for traffic.Just 937 ships used the canal last month, while there were 260 cancellations of crossings, canal administrator Ricaurte Vásquez said Wednesday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageHe said 119 of the cancellations involved giant LNG and LPG tankers that were to have carried liquified gas, mostly from the United States to Asia. Crossings by cruise ships and car carriers also declined.The coronavirus pandemic has hurt international trade and economic activity around the globe. Vásquez said recovery in traffic might be slow, but some analysts predicted a more rapid rebound.“It will be able to recover rapidly because the world’s reactivation depends on the reactivation of trade,” said analyst José Isabel Blandón Sr. “And in the reactivation of trade, the United States needs Panama, China and South America need Panama, and Europe, too.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/panama-canal-sees-21-drop-in-crossings-amid-pandemic/story-3XH3ut0XQwm9yRwGrpifiN.html
18-06-2020||World||Race for Covid-19 vaccine could leave some countries behind||As the race for a vaccine against the new coronavirus intensifies, rich countries are rushing to place advance orders for the inevitably limited supply to guarantee their citizens get immunised first - leaving significant questions about whether developing countries will get any vaccine before the pandemic ends.Earlier this month, the UN, International Red Cross and Red Crescent, and others said it was a “moral imperative” that everyone have access to a “people’s vaccine”. But such grand declarations are unenforceable, and without a detailed strategy, the allocation of vaccines could be extremely messy.“We have this beautiful picture of everyone getting the vaccine, but there is no road map on how to do it,” said Yuan Qiong Hu, a senior legal and policy adviser at Medecins Sans Frontieres in Geneva. She said numerous problems must be resolved to manage distribution and that few measures have been taken.In the past, Hu said, companies have often applied for patents for nearly every step of a vaccine’s development and production: from the biological material like cell lines used, to the preservative needed to stretch vaccine doses and even how the shots are administered.“We can’t afford to face these multiple layers of private rights to create a ‘people’s vaccine,’“ she said. Speaking at a vaccine summit earlier this month that addressed the thorny issue of equitable distribution, Ghanaian President Nana Akufo-Addo agreed.“The global spread of Covid-19 has told us in no uncertain terms that disease knows no boundaries and no country can afford to go it alone,” he said. “Only a people’s vaccine with equality and solidarity at its core can protect all of humanity from the virus...A bold international agreement to this end cannot wait.” Worldwide, about a dozen potential Covid-19 vaccines are in early stages of testing. While some could move into late stage testing later this year if all goes well, it’s unlikely any would be licensed before early next year at the earliest. Still, numerous rich countries have already ordered some of these experimental shots and expect delivery even before they are granted marketing approval.Britain and the US have sunk millions of dollars into various vaccine candidates, including one being developed by Oxford University and manufactured by AstraZeneca. In return, both countries are expected to get priority treatment; the British government declared that if the vaccine proves effective, the first 30 million doses would be earmarked for Britons.Separately AstraZeneca signed an agreement to make at least 300 million doses available for the US, with the first batches delivered as early as October. Last week, the European Union moved to ensure its own supply. On Saturday, AstraZeneca struck a deal with a vaccines group forged by Germany, France, Italy and the Netherlands to secure 400 million doses by the end of the year.Among several global efforts underway to try to ensure developing countries don’t get left behind is an “advance market commitment” from the vaccines alliance GAVI that aims to persuade manufacturers to make enough for both rich and poor countries.That can “prevent countries from scrambling to try to invest,” said Seth Berkley, CEO of GAVI, which used the approach to secure Ebola and pneumonia vaccines for a global market. “Because if you’re investing in one or two vaccines, of course the ... probability of those vaccines working is quite low. And so yes, you may hit the jackpot and have a vaccine that works. But you also may end up with no vaccine and be left behind.” Two global vaccine groups have inked a $750 million deal with AstraZeneca to supply 400 million doses by the end of 2020. The Anglo-Swedish pharma giant has also agreed to license its vaccine to India’s Serum Institute for the production of 1 billion doses.Johnson & Johnson’s chief scientific officer, Dr Paul Stoffels, said the company plans to make its coronavirus shot for poor countries at a not-for-profit price. Likewise, AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot has pledged to make the vaccine available at no profit during the pandemic.The World Health Organization and others have called for a Covid-19 “patents pool,” where intellectual property rights would be surrendered so pharmaceuticals could freely share data and technical knowledge. Numerous countries including Australia, Brazil, Canada and Germany have already begun revising their licensing laws to allow them to suspend intellectual property rights if authorities decide there is an overwhelming need given the pandemic.But the response from the industry has been lukewarm.Executives at Pfizer and some other major drug makers say they oppose suspending patent rights for potential Covid-19 vaccines.“We can’t just rely on goodwill to ensure access. With HIV/AIDS, it took 10 years for the drugs to reach people in lower-income countries. If that happens with Covid-19, that would be very worrying,” said Arzoo Ahmed of Britain’s Nuffield Council on Bioethics. Dr Soumya Swaminathan, WHO’s chief scientist, said the UN health agency is currently working on developing an “allocation framework” for how coronavirus vaccines should be given out. But this guidance would not be binding.“We don’t want to be in a situation where there are doses of a vaccine but they’re just available to some countries,” she said. “We need to have a consensus on that so we can agree to share the vaccine in a way that protects the most vulnerable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/race-for-covid-19-vaccine-could-leave-some-countries-behind/story-mfFhqQB5Bdf93tsgAlOIRL.html
18-06-2020||World||Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation establishes $12M grant fund||The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation has established a fund worth more than $12 million to aid organizations fighting institutional racism, in the wake of the George Floyd protests.On Wednesday, the foundation, which has been influential in the emergence of the broader Black Lives Matter movement, said it was setting aside $6 million in donations to support black-led grassroots organising groups. Last week, it unveiled a separate $6.5 million fund for its network of affiliate chapters.Beginning July 1, affiliated chapters can apply for unrestricted funding of up to $500,000 in multi-year grants, the foundation announced. Grants from both funds will be administered through a fiscal sponsor, said Kailee Scales, managing director of the foundation.“In this watershed moment for black power building ... it is critical that we democratize giving to ensure all of us have access to the resources we need to reverse centuries of disinvestment in black communities, and invest in a future where we can all be connected, represented and free,” Scales said in a statement to The Associated Press.According to the network’s website, the organization has more than a dozen active chapters, including Boston, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and Detroit, as well as in Canada. Its newest chapter is in South Bend, Indiana.The foundation told the AP it has received more than 1.1 million individual donations at an average of $33 per gift since the death of Floyd, a black man who died May 25 pleading for air as a white Minneapolis police officer held a knee to his neck for what prosecutors said was nearly nine minutes. The surge of financial support adds to roughly $3.4 million in net assets the BLM Global Network had on hand last year, according to a 2019 financial statement of Thousand Currents, the fiscal sponsor which receives donations on the network’s behalf and then releases money to the group.Creation of the funds signals a growth in infrastructure for the network, which had been at odds with some local chapter organizers, who felt network leaders weren’t providing enough financial support for initiatives such as rapid response to police brutality. Although there are many groups that use Black Lives Matter or BLM in their names, only 16 are considered affiliates of the global network.For Black Lives Matter Los Angeles, the network’s first official chapter, the fund will increase its capacity to support families in need of legal aid, public communications strategy and other services after a loved one is killed by police, said organizer Melina Abdullah, who is a professor in the Pan-African Studies department at California State University, Los Angeles.“We’ve been struggling for seven years now with very limited resources,” Abdullah told the AP. “We’re not paid. But we also have real costs, even if we’re not taking salaries.”Renewed energy in the BLM movement has created a need for more resources, she added. “This fund will allow us to move forward in really strong ways.”Racial justice groups across the U.S. have reported receiving tens of millions of dollars in donations, particularly for community bail funds posting bond for protesters arrested in demonstrations. The wealth is being spread across younger grassroots organizations and legacy institutions, such as the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund and the National Urban League.The Black Lives Matter movement emerged in 2013 amid anger over the acquittal of George Zimmerman, the Florida man who shot and killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in 2012. The network of chapters was formed in 2014, following what organizers called Ferguson October, a national mobilization in response to the police shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri.“I’m really proud of the work we’ve been able to do in the last seven years,” Patrisse Cullors, co-founder and chairwoman of the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, said in a statement. “What is clear is that Black Lives Matter shares a name with a much larger movement and there are literally hundreds of organizations that do impactful racial and gender justice work who make up the fabric of this broader movement.”The foundation has already identified several movement organizations that it would like to support, said Cullors, who declined to name the groups. The foundation says it will “prioritize mutual aid organizations, direct service and organizations focused on creating sustainable improvements in the material conditions for all black people.” It also looks to support black lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender-led groups.Over its nearly six years of existence, the BLM Global Network had received contributions from high-profile donors, including A-list entertainers such as Jay-Z, Beyoncé and Prince, who contributed to BLM mere weeks before his death in 2016. But unanswered questions of transparency and access to those gifts left some organizers in network affiliate chapters frustrated.In January 2018, a New York City chapter announced its decision to leave the BLM Global Network, citing the need for autonomy to better serve its community. In December 2019, a different group of organizers in New York rejoined the network, Scales said.ALSO READ: It’s your time now: Beyonce pays tribute to Black Lives Matter, calls out sexism and racism is powerful graduation speechIn recent weeks, the BLM Global Network has had to debunk misinformation from conservative activists who claimed the group’s donations were being redirected to the Democratic Party.The network has also been in a tug of war with a California-based organization called the “Black Lives Matter Foundation,” which has accepted donations that do not support the movement. The other group reportedly raised millions of dollars in recent weeks from small individual gifts and from employees of large corporations, such as Apple and Microsoft, who believed they were supporting the Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation.(This story has been published from a wire agency feed without modifications to the text.

Drug-makers and experts across the world are ramping up efforts to arrive at the potential vaccine against Covid-19.

That has followed the fierce reaction in the United States after the killing of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis last month.However, the House of Commons’ Whip for Therrien’s party, Claude DeBellefeuille, described Singh’s use of the term as “unacceptable”.According to the CBC News, the motion also called for a review of the RCMP’s budget and how it interacted with the public, among other matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-s-ndp-leader-jagmeet-singh-expelled-house-of-commons-for-calling-mp-racist/story-7ZHprJf19iUfVTXi1ZLXAL.html
18-06-2020||World||Massive spying on users of Google Chrome shows new security weakness||A newly discovered spyware effort attacked users through 32 million downloads of extensions to Google’s market-leading Chrome web browser, researchers at Awake Security told Reuters, highlighting the tech industry’s failure to protect browsers as they are used more for email, payroll and other sensitive functions.Alphabet Inc’s Google said it removed more than 70 of the malicious add-ons from its official Chrome Web Store after being alerted by the researchers last month. “When we are alerted of extensions in the Web Store that violate our policies, we take action and use those incidents as training material to improve our automated and manual analyses,” Google spokesman Scott Westover told Reuters. Also read: Google Chrome developers want to replace all ‘Blacklist’ coding references to ‘Blocklist’Most of the free extensions purported to warn users about questionable websites or convert files from one format to another. Instead, they siphoned off browsing history and data that provided credentials for access to internal business tools.Based on the number of downloads, it was the most far-reaching malicious Chrome store campaign to date, according to Awake co-founder and chief scientist Gary Golomb. Google declined to discuss how the latest spyware compared with prior campaigns, the breadth of the damage, or why it did not detect and remove the bad extensions on its own despite past promises to supervise offerings more closely.It is unclear who was behind the effort to distribute the malware. Awake said the developers supplied fake contact information when they submitted the extensions to Google. Also read: How to enable dark mode in Google Search“Anything that gets you into somebody’s browser or email or other sensitive areas would be a target for national espionage as well as organized crime,” said former National Security Agency engineer Ben Johnson, who founded security companies Carbon Black and Obsidian Security.The extensions were designed to avoid detection by antivirus companies or security software that evaluates the reputations of web domains, Golomb said.If someone used the browser to surf the web on a home computer, it would connect to a series of websites and transmit information, the researchers found. Anyone using a corporate network, which would include security services, would not transmit the sensitive information or even reach the malicious versions of the websites.“This shows how attackers can use extremely simple methods to hide, in this case, thousands of malicious domains,” Golomb said. All of the domains in question, more than 15,000 linked to each other in total, were purchased from a small registrar in Israel, Galcomm, known formally as CommuniGal Communication Ltd.Awake said Galcomm should have known what was happening.In an email exchange, Galcomm owner Moshe Fogel told Reuters that his company had done nothing wrong.“Galcomm is not involved, and not in complicity with any malicious activity whatsoever,” Fogel wrote. “You can say exactly the opposite, we cooperate with law enforcement and security bodies to prevent as much as we can.”Fogel said there was no record of the inquiries Golomb said he made in April and again in May to the company’s email address for reporting abusive behavior, and he asked for a list of suspect domains. Reuters sent him that list three times without getting a substantive response.The Internet Corp for Assigned Names and Numbers, which oversees registrars, said it had received few complaints about Galcomm over the years, and none about malware.While deceptive extensions have been a problem for years, they are getting worse. They initially spewed unwanted advertisements, and now are more likely to install additional malicious programs or track where users are and what they are doing for government or commercial spies.Malicious developers have been using Google’s Chrome Store as a conduit for a long time. After one in 10 submissions was deemed malicious, Google said in 2018 https://blog.chromium.org/2018/10/trustworthy-chrome-extensions-by-default.html it would improve security, in part by increasing human review.But in February, independent researcher Jamila Kaya and Cisco Systems’ Duo Security uncovered https://duo.com/labs/research/crxcavator-malvertising-2020 a similar Chrome campaign that stole data from about 1.7 million users. Google joined the investigation and found 500 fraudulent extensions. “We do regular sweeps to find extensions using similar techniques, code and behaviors,” Google’s Westover said, in identical language to what Google gave out after Duo’s report.

18-06-2020||World||Atlanta prosecutors hope to persuade jury to second-guess officer who shot Brooks||Prosecutors seeking to convict Atlanta police officer Garrett Rolfe for murder in the shooting death of Rayshard Brooks must try to persuade jurors to do something they rarely do - second guess split-second police decisions. On Wednesday, Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard brought 11 charges against Rolfe, with the most serious being felony murder which carries the death penalty.Atlanta’s mayor fired Rolfe after Friday’s shooting. Civil rights groups were quick to condemn the lethal methods. Protests broke out in the city as the shooting fueled popular outrage that followed the May 25 death of another unarmed black man, George Floyd, as an officer knelt on his neck during his arrest in Minnesota.Video of the shooting that went viral will likely help the prosecution, and Howard noted that US, Rolfe’s partner, agreed to become the rare police officer who will testify against a colleague. Prosecutors will stress that the officer shot Brooks in the back as he fled, and insist that the suspect posed no threat. Defense attorneys will likely note that Brooks took the officer’s Taser, or stun gun, and brandished it before he fled.Steve Gaynor, president of the Fraternal Order of Police in Cobbs County in Georgia, insisted that Rolfe’s actions were justified under US Supreme Court guidance.“Look at case law. The officer is well within his right to use deadly force,” said Gaynor.Laws governing police use of force differ by state, but the Supreme Court has said deadly force can be used if an officer reasonably believes the suspect poses an immediate threat of serious injury to the officer or others.Georgia allows use of deadly force to apprehend a suspect when officers have probable cause to believe the suspect committed a crime involving infliction or threatened infliction of serious harm, which Gaynor said Brooks had done.He said Brooks committed assault on the officers, a robbery when he seized the stun gun and aggravated assault when fired the stun gun at the officers.Howard, the district attorney, said Brooks posed no threat as he was fleeing because he had discharged the available shots from the stun gun. Gaynor disagreed.“It’s still a weapon, maybe not a deadly weapons but it is a weapon. The public is still in jeopardy at that point,” said Gaynor.Rolfe’s defense attorney could also argue that he followed police training protocols. Jack Ryan, who trains law enforcement nationwide, said some police departments teach officers to consider using deadly force if a suspect has gained control of an officer’s stun gun. However, that is less of a threat when there are multiple officers present.The Atlanta police department did not respond to a request for comment on its training. Ultimately, like most cases against police, legal experts said it could come down to whether a jury is willing to defer to an officer’s version of events. Jonathan Rapping, president of the public defender group Gideon’s Promise in Atlanta, said white jurors in such cases often tend to exaggerate threats posed by minority suspects.“We’re reluctant to second-guess police,” said Rapping, who is a professor at John Marshall Law School.For that reason, having testimony from Rolfe’s partner Brosnan could be key for prosecutors.Sam Starks, an Atlanta criminal defense attorney, said obtaining the cooperation of the other officer was a surprise and “makes it harder for Rolfe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/atlanta-prosecutors-hope-to-persuade-jury-to-second-guess-officer-who-shot-brooks/story-hYBZKZTjD1ukvQuswjpfqJ.html

According to the research, published in the journal Nano Letters, these “nanosponges,” which are thousand times smaller than the width of a single human hair, are named so as they soak up harmful pathogens and toxins.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage These particles were developed by engineers, including those from the University of California (UC) San Diego in the US, for their ability to prevent the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, from hijacking host cells. Following incubation with the nanosponges, the researchers said, “SARS-CoV-2 is neutralized and unable to infect cells.” In experiments performed on lab-grown cells, they said nanosponges built with lung and immune cell membranes caused SARS-CoV-2 to lose nearly 90 per cent of its “viral infectivity” in a dose-dependent manner. Viral infectivity, the scientists explained, is a measure of the ability of a virus to enter the host cell and exploit its resources to replicate and produce additional infectious copies of itself. “Traditionally, drug developers for infectious diseases dive deep on the details of the pathogen in order to find druggable targets. Our approach is different,” said study co-author Liangfang Zhang, a nanoengineering professor at the UC San Diego. “We only need to know what the target cells are. And then we aim to protect the targets by creating biomimetic decoys,” Zhang said. The scientists explained that instead of targeting the virus itself, the nanosponges are designed to protect the healthy cells which the virus invades. They said the nanosponges when engineered with fragments of the outer membranes of the human immune system’s macrophage cells can also soak up inflammatory cell-cell signalling proteins called cytokines. According to the scientists, the cytokines, which are sometimes overdriven by immune response to the infection, are implicated in some of the most dangerous, and sometimes deadly, aspects of Covid-19.Describing the structure of the nanosponges, the researchers said they consist of a polymer core coated in membranes extracted from either the cells lining the lung’s outer layer, or the immune system’s macrophages. They said these membranes cover the sponges with all the same protein receptors as the cells they impersonate, adding that this includes whatever receptors the novel coronavirus uses to enter cells in the human body. In the research, the scientists prepared several different concentrations of nanosponges in solution to test against SARS-CoV-2. They then tested the ability of various concentrations of each nanosponge type to reduce the infectivity of the virus behind the Covid-19 pandemic. The researchers found that at a concentration of five milligrammes per milliliter (mg/mL), the lung cell membrane-cloaked sponges inhibited 93 per cent of the viral infectivity of SARS-CoV-2. According to the study, the macrophage-cloaked sponges inhibited 88 per cent of the viral infectivity. “From the perspective of an immunologist and virologist, the nanosponge platform was immediately appealing as a potential antiviral because of its ability to work against viruses of any kind,” said Anna Honko, study co-author from Boston University. “This means that as opposed to a drug or antibody that might very specifically block SARS-CoV-2 infection or replication, these cell membrane nanosponges might function in a more holistic manner in treating a broad spectrum of viral infectious diseases,” Honko explained. In the next few months, the scientists plan to test the effectiveness of the nanosponges in neutralising the novel coronavirus in animal models. “Another interesting aspect of our approach is that even as SARS-CoV-2 mutates, as long as the virus can still invade the cells we are mimicking, our nanosponge approach should still work,” Zhang said. “I’m not sure this can be said for some of the vaccines and therapeutics that are currently being developed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-use-nanosponges-to-soak-up-neutralise-coronavirus-in-lab-study/story-Llv0522TbyEBnaXUWr3kvO.html
18-06-2020||World||South Korea’s nuclear envoy visits US as tensions flare with North Korea||South Korea’s chief nuclear negotiator will hold talks with officials in Washington on Thursday amid flaring tensions with North Korea after Pyongyang blew up an inter-Korean liaison office and threatened military action.Lee Do-hoon’s unannounced trip came days after North Korea blew up a joint liaison office in Kaesong, near the South Korean border and declared an end to dialogue with the South.Lee is expected to hold consultations with US officials, including Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun who had led denuclearisation negotiations with North Korea, Seoul’s foreign ministry said.Lee and Biegun will “assess the current situation on the Korean peninsula and discuss responses,” the ministry said in a statement.South Korean television showed Lee arriving at Washington’s Dulles International Airport on Wednesday evening, where he declined to comment to reporters.Pyongyang has increasingly snubbed Seoul’s calls for engagement as efforts to restart inter-Korean economic projects stalled due to international sanctions designed to rein in the North’s nuclear and missile programmes.North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, on Wednesday criticised South Korean President Moon Jae-in for failing to implement a 2018 peace accord, saying Moon “put his neck into the noose of pro-US flunkeyism.”Pyongyang has also taken issue over defectors in the South sending propaganda leaflets into North Korea.Several defector-led groups regularly send back flyers carrying critical messages of Kim Jong Un, often together with food, $1 bills, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean dramas and news.The Rodong Sinmun, the official newspaper of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party, said the demolition of the liaison office was the “first stage action” in its “holy war” aimed at punishing Seoul authorities for turning a blind eye to the defector’s campaign.“It was an iron hammer of stern punishment meted out to those who were having empty dreams while pursuing concealed hostile policy,” it said in a commentary.The newspaper also ran a series of articles and photos carrying angry ordinary citizens calling for retaliation and vowing to send anti-South leaflets over the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/update-1-s-korea-s-nuclear-envoy-visits-u-s-as-tensions-flare-with-north-korea/story-bdZrSrivCAdPf0US5PajkO.html
18-06-2020||World||Top US, China diplomats meet in Hawaii amid frayed ties over handling of Covid crisis||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met China’s top diplomat, Yang Jiechi, in Hawaii on Wednesday amid a deep deterioration of ties between the strategic rivals, their first face-to-face meeting since last year.The world’s two largest economies have been at loggerheads over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and China’s move to impose security legislation on Hong Kong, among the latest flare-ups in tensions that have sharply escalated this year.Yang told Pompeo that Washington needs to respect Beijing’s positions on key issues, halt its interference on matters such as Hong Kong, Taiwan and Xinjiang, and work to repair relations, China’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Thursday.Yang said cooperation between the two countries “is the only correct choice”, according to the ministry.Pompeo stressed “the need for fully-reciprocal dealings between the two nations across commercial, security, and diplomatic interactions,” US State Department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus said in a statement.“He also stressed the need for full transparency and information sharing to combat the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and prevent future outbreaks.”Beijing described the meeting as “constructive” and said the two sides had agreed to continue engagement.The meeting in Honolulu started shortly after 9 a.m. (1900 GMT) and concluded at 3:50 p.m. (0150 GMT Thursday), a senior State Department official said. As the meeting got under way, US President Donald Trump signed legislation calling for sanctions against those responsible for repression of Uighur Muslims in China’s Xinjiang region, which prompted a threat of retaliation from Beijing.Separately, foreign ministers of the G7 countries, including Pompeo, issued a statement calling on China not to follow through with the Hong Kong legislation which critics call an assault on the territory’s democratic freedoms.Pompeo has been forceful in his criticism of Beijing and it was his first known contact with Yang since they discussed the coronavirus by phone on April 15.Tensions have risen also over China’s neighbor North Korea. The United States and China share concerns about that country’s nuclear weapons program.Low pointExperts say US-China relations have reached their lowest point in years, and in mid-May Trump, who has pursued a deal to end a damaging trade war he launched with China, went so far as to suggest he could cut ties with Beijing.The bill Trump signed earlier on Wednesday calls for sanctions on Chinese officials responsible for oppressing Uighur Muslims.Trump tempered that possibility by saying he regarded the bill’s sanctions requirements as advisory, not mandatory.While Trump and his administration have stepped up rhetoric against China in the run-up to the November US election, his former national security adviser, John Bolton, said on Wednesday the president sought Chinese President Xi Jinping’s help to win re-election during a closed-door June 2019 meeting.Bolton’s accusations are part of a book that the US government on Tuesday sued to block him from publishing, arguing it contained classified information and would compromise national security.Trump hit back at Bolton, calling him “a liar” in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. He told Fox News in a separate interview that Bolton had broken the law by including highly classified material in the book.Neither side outlined an agenda for the Hawaii talks, but diplomats and other sources have said the meeting was requested by China.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer also told a congressional hearing that Chinese officials had repeatedly affirmed their commitment to buy more US goods and services under a Phase 1 trade deal signed in January and that some $10 billion in purchases had been recorded thus far. Lighthizer also said, when asked about exports of products made by Uighurs and other Muslim groups in camps in China, that Washington would “strongly enforce” US laws banning the import of goods made by forced labor.Among his criticisms of China, Pompeo has said it could have prevented hundreds of thousands of deaths from the global coronavirus pandemic by being more transparent, and accused it of refusing to share information.Trump has initiated a process of eliminating special US treatment for Hong Kong to punish China for curbing freedoms there, but has stopped short of immediately ending privileges that have helped the territory remain a global financial center.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-china-diplomats-meet-in-hawaii-amid-frayed-ties-over-handling-of-covid-crisis/story-bFZRcIUI2RdEOZqhZ30JzO.html

The organizations said it is the largest individual gift in support of student scholarships at HBCUs.Hastings has a history of supporting educational causes, including charter schools. He launched a $100 million education fund in 2016, beginning with money toward college scholarships for black and Latino students.Hastings said now is the time when “everyone needs to figure out” how to contribute to solving racism. He said HBCUs have been resilient “little-known gems” for black education.Amid protests over police brutality that began three weeks ago, companies and business leaders have been pledging solidarity with their black employees and the black community. But tech companies — including Netflix — have fallen short in hiring, retaining and promoting underrepresented minorities within their own ranks.Other tech industry donations in the wake of the Black Lives Matter protests have largely been on the company level. On Wednesday, Google CEO Sundar Pichai outlined plans toward racial equity at the company that includes increasing the number of black and other underrepresented minority executives and creating a $175 million “economic opportunity package” that includes $100 million in funding for black-led venture capital firms and startups.Last week, Apple CEO Tim Cook announced that the company will spend $100 million on a new Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, investing in education and criminal justice reform among other things.

18-06-2020||World||China is on NATO radar more than ever: Report||China is on the NATO radar more than ever, a top American envoy to the powerful military grouping has said, asserting that Beijing could be a peaceful partner but it is not showing that right now.Kay Bailey Hutchison, US Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), told reporters at a virtual meeting here on Wednesday that NATO is beginning to assess what China is doing.“China could be a peaceful partner, a good trade partner, but they’re not showing that right now, and I think NATO partners are looking at this,” she said.“It’s much more on our radar screen, and I think it should be because we should assess the risk, hope for the best but prepare for the worst,” Hutchison said on the aggressive behaviour and provocative actions of China against Taiwan, Japan and India.On whether a risk of an actual military confrontation was on the horizon, she said, “I think NATO is now looking to the East.” Everything that has been happening with the 5G networks is being dealt with in the US and Europe throughout the alliance, Hutchison said.“We’re trying to keep our communications secure and seeing that some of the Chinese competitors do not have the capability to control the contractual obligations that are made by communications providers – all of those things, including the Belt and Road Initiative, are raising concerns among our allies, about what is the intent of China,” she said.The United States is very clear that it wants China to be a partner in the world order and it is known that China has stolen intellectual property, violated tariff and subsidies set down by the world courts and the World Trade Organization, Hutchison said.“So we know that China has the capability to compete on a level playing field, and we’re asking them to do that, but we’re also turning a wary eye to their behaviour right now in the South China Sea, militarising islands that they said would never be done, as well as the clampdown on Hong Kong,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-is-on-nato-radar-more-than-ever-report/story-dwrJwZayWL725500BQjdpN.html
18-06-2020||World||Donald Trump ‘pleaded’ with Xi Jinping to help win 2020 US polls, says John Bolton||President Donald Trump had pleaded with President Xi Jinping to help him win a second term during trade negotiations and also endorsed the Chinese leader’s concentration camps for Uygur Muslims, writes John Bolton, the former US national security adviser, in an upcoming book widely previewed in American media Wednesday.Among other bombshell revelations in the book — “Room where it happened” based on Bolton’s 16 months as Trump’s NSA — were reported claims that the US president did not know that the United Kingdom was a nuclear power and that he believed Finland was a part of Russia.But the revelation that sent shockwaves through US political circles was his pleas to Xi for help with his re-election bid. It happened on June 29, 2019, when the two leaders met separately on the sidelines of the Osaka G-20 and came around to discussing trade disputes under negotiation.“Trump, then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming US presidential election, alluding to China’s economic capability and pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win,” Bolton writes in an excerpt from the book adapted for The Wall Street Journal. “He stressed the importance of farmers and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome. I would print Trump’s exact words, but the government’s prepublication review process has decided otherwise.”Xi had agreed to these requests — not specifically to his re-election bid — and to resume talks, which led to Trump’s effusive praise of Xi. Bolton writes that the US president hailed Xi as the “greatest Chinese leader in 300 years” and then corrected himself a few minutes later to accord him a promotion as “the greatest leader in Chinese history”.At the same meeting in Osaka, Bolton writes, “Xi had explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang. According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which Trump thought was exactly the right thing to do”.Trump has never been able to shake off perception that Russians interfered in the 2016 election to help him defeat Hillary Clinton, which has been reaffirmed by US intelligence and a subsequent investigation by the FBI. And now this claim that he directly sought the Chinese leader’s help to win a second term.Trump blasted Bolton in a retaliatory post on twitter as a “total failure” in government and, who, he added, “bungled” in everything he did. But he did not address the specific issue of his “pleading” to Xi.Thursday morning, the president fired back again, saying, ”Many of the ridiculous statements he attributes to me were never made, pure fiction. Just trying to get even for firing him like the sick puppy he is!’The department of justice sued Bolton on Tuesday in a bid to delay the publication of the book saying it contained classified material.The book is due out next Tuesday. But the storm had started already. “If these accounts are true, it’s not only morally repugnant, it’s a violation of Donald Trump’s sacred duty to the American people to protect America’s interests and defend our values,” said Joe Biden, the former vice-president the presumptive Democratic nominee to take on Trump in November.He added: “And my message to China’s leaders, or anyone else who President Trump might invite to interfere: stay out of our democracy. Stay out of our elections.”The many instances of Trumps’s complete capitulation to the Chinese leader are in stark contrast to the rhetoric he has now deployed to blame China for the Covid-19 deaths and infections in American, with an eye on his re-election prospects, which, his former NSA says in the book, is an overriding obsession.“I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my White House tenure that wasn’t driven by re-election calculations,” he writes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pleaded-with-xi-jinping-to-help-win-2020-us-polls-says-john-bolton/story-ZcBLk74fbJSzYPW9eMiXmN.html

China’s sprawling food markets have emerged as an ideal breeding ground for the coronavirus, which has now infected more than 8 million people worldwide. The first major cluster of infections was traced to the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, where bats and other wild animals were believed to be on sale.The CCDI report noted that most of the markets were built 20 to 30 years ago, when drainage and wastewater treatment was relatively undeveloped.An Yufa, a professor at China Agricultural University, was cited in the report as saying the markets must follow international practice and implement origin tracing systems as well as documentation on storage, transport and sale.Officials in Wuhan province took 3,000 samples from tools, chopping boards and drains in 114 farmers’ markets and 107 supermarkets this week to check for potential new sources of infection. All came up negative, they said.China has promised to ban the trade and consumption and wildlife in a bid to minimise disease transmission, though the use of wild animal products in traditional medicine will still be permitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-says-it-must-improve-hygiene-in-markets-after-beijing-outbreak/story-L1vGG5N8szt3I158kkmPrI.html
18-06-2020||World||Americans face new coronavirus challenge: A shortage of coins||Banks across the United States are facing a shortage of coins during coronavirus crisis, prompting the US Federal Reserve to ration distribution and work with the US Mint to boost supply. With the partial closure of the economy due to the coronavirus crisis, “the flow of coins through the economy has kind of stopped,” Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell told the House Financial Services Committee. Making matters worse, the US Mint has decreased production of coin due to measures put in place to protect its employees. “We are working with the Mint and the Reserve Banks and as the economy reopens we are seeing coins beginning to move around again,” Powell said. He made the remarks in response to a question from Tennessee Congressman John Rose, who said a bank in his district told him it would run out of coins by the end of the week because the Fed was only sending a portion of its usual order of coins. “We all don’t want to wake up to headlines in the near future such as ‘Banks run out of money,’“ he said. Banks “don’t know what to tell their customers.”Powell said he was well aware of the issue and believed it would be temporary. “We feel like we are making progress,” Powell said. The Fed on Monday told banks it is working with the Mint to increase supply, but that until the shortage can be cured would limit the number of pennies, nickels, dimes and quarters it sends to them “to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of coin inventory.” Allocations will be based on banks’ historical patterns of coin orders, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/americans-face-new-coronavirus-challenge-a-shortage-of-coins/story-VI4FtD5xnetWyb01ZJrV6J.html

18-06-2020||World||Millions of abandoned oil wells are leaking methane, a climate menace||In May 2012, Hanson and Michael Rowe noticed an overpowering smell, like rotten eggs, seeping from an abandoned gas well on their land in Kentucky. The fumes made the retired couple feel nauseous, dizzy, and short of breath.Regulators responding to the leak couldn’t find an owner to fix it. J.D. Carty Resources LLC had drilled the well near the Rowes’ home in 2006 - promising the family a 12.5% royalty and free natural gas, which they never got. But Carty went bust in 2008 and sold the site to a company that was later acquired by Blue Energy LLC. Lawyers for both companies deny any responsibility for the leak.A year later, Kentucky’s Division of Oil and Gas declared the well an environmental emergency and hired Boots & Coots Inc - the Texas contractor that doused oil-well fires after the Gulf War - to plug it. During the 40-day operation, the Rowes retreated to a trailer on their property and lived with no running water to escape the gases and noise. Regulators determined the leak was a toxic blend of hydrogen sulfide, a common drilling byproduct, and the potent greenhouse gas methane. “I wouldn’t go through this again for $1 million,” said Hanson Rowe, who with his wife is suing the energy companies for compensation. The incident, while extreme, reflects a growing global problem: More than a century of oil and gas drilling has left behind millions of abandoned wells, many of which are leaching pollutants into the air and water. And drilling companies are likely to abandon many more wells due to bankruptcies, as oil prices struggle to recover from historic lows after the coronavirus pandemic crushed global fuel demand, according to bankruptcy lawyers, industry analysts and state regulators.Leaks from abandoned wells have long been recognized as an environmental problem, a health hazard and a public nuisance. They have been linked to dozens of instances of groundwater contamination by research commissioned by the Groundwater Protection Council, whose members include state ground water agencies. Orphaned wells have been blamed for a slew of public safety incidents over the years, including a methane blowout at the construction site of a waterfront hotel in California last year.They also pose a serious threat to the climate that researchers and world governments are only starting to understand, according to a Reuters review of government data and interviews with scientists, regulators, and United Nations officials. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last year recommended that UN member countries start tracking and publishing the amount of methane leaching from their abandoned oil and gas wells after scientists started flagging it as a global warming risk. So far, the United States and Canada are the only nations to do so.The US figures are sobering: More than 3.2 million abandoned oil and gas wells together emitted 281 kilotons of methane in 2018, according to the data, which was included in the US Environmental Protection Agency’s most recent report on April 14 to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. That’s the climate-damage equivalent of consuming about 16 million barrels of crude oil, according to an EPA calculation, or about as much as the United States, the world’s biggest oil consumer, uses in a typical day. The actual amount could be as much as three times higher, the EPA says, because of incomplete data. The agency believes most of the methane comes from the more than 2 million abandoned wells it estimates were never properly plugged.The problem is less severe in Canada, where the bulk of oil production comes from oil sands mining instead of traditional drilling. The government estimated that its 313,000 abandoned wells emitted 10.1 kt of methane in 2018, far less than in the United States.The global impact is harder to measure. The governments of Russia, Saudi Arabia, and China – which round out the top five world oil-and-gas producers – did not respond to Reuters’ requests for comment on their abandoned wells and have not published reports on the wells’ methane leakage.Researchers say it’s impossible to accurately estimate global emissions from leaky abandoned wells without better data. But a rough Reuters calculation, based on the US share of global crude oil and natural gas production, would place the number of abandoned wells around the world at more than 29 million, with emissions of 2.5 million tonnes of methane per year - the climate-damage equivalent of three weeks of US oil consumption.Hidden menace In a forested area of western New York state in February, a group of state regulators, along with researchers from the State University of New York at Binghamton, trudged through the snow. They stopped at a rotting wooden structure encircling a rusted pipe.Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) official Charlie Dietrich held a bright orange device over the heap. It emitted a high-pitched signal, and its screen showed a code indicating the presence of ignitable gas. A scent of petroleum wafted through the air.“There’s some methane coming up out of there,” DEC Mineral Resources Specialist Nathan Graber said.The abandoned well lies in the forests of Olean, New York, which was an oil boomtown at the turn of the 20th century. The site was one of 72 locations logged by geophysicists Tim de Smet and Alex Nikulin in December, researchers from Binghamton, using a drone equipped with a metal detector, part of a program launched in 2013 to help New York identify and plug abandoned wells.New York’s DEC has records of 2,200 abandoned wells dating back to the late 1800s. But the state believes the actual number could be much higher, because of incomplete records.“It’s a lot easier to find stuff when you know where to look,” Nikulin said.The group is among an array of regulators, activists and federal agencies now seeking out abandoned wells from the US Northeast to California. The heightened interest in the climate threat posed by the wells started with a 2014 study by Princeton graduate student Mary Kang, who was the first to measure methane emissions from old drilling sites in Pennsylvania. She concluded in 2016 that abandoned wells represent 5% to 8% of total human-caused methane emissions in the state.“It’s not like they leak for one year, and then they stop,” said Kang, now a professor of civil engineering at McGill University in Montreal. “Some of these have been there maybe for 100 years. And they are going to be there for another 100 years.”Although the Trump administration has downplayed global warming and its link to fossil fuels, the US Energy Department has been financing efforts to improve data on emissions from abandoned wells. Researchers from DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) recently took measurements from more than 200 wells in Kentucky and Oklahoma and are planning field work in Texas. They plan to publish their data by next spring.NETL researcher Natalie Pekney said the work was crucial to better understanding the climate impact of abandoned wells. Many wells don’t leak much or at all, she said, while others have “huge” methane emissions.NETL had previously used aerial surveys to locate old wells in Pennsylvania – home to the massive Marcellus gas deposit – so drillers could avoid pushing fluids and gases up through old abandoned well sites deep in the state’s forests. Its researchers found many old wells contained bubbling fluids, an indicator of methane leaks.Growing problemNationwide, the number of documented abandoned wells has jumped by more than 12% since 2008, around the start of the hydraulic fracturing boom, according to the EPA estimates.Many experts believe the number will keep growing. Oil-and-gas firm bankruptcies in the United States and Canada rose 50% to 42 in 2019, and analysts say the rate is likely to accelerate as the pandemic-related slide in energy prices shakes out producers.Research firm Rystad Energy estimates that about 73 US drilling companies could go bankrupt this year, with an additional 170 succumbing in 2021, assuming an average oil price of $30 a barrel.“When prices are this low, it becomes a very serious problem. It becomes a fight over who is going to ultimately have to pay” for cleaning up abandoned wells, said John Penn, a bankruptcy attorney with Perkins Coie LLP in Dallas. “It makes it really bad, and it’s going to get worse.”A school district in Beverly Hills, California, was saddled with a bill of at least $11 million to plug 19 oil wells on the property of its high school, after a judge in 2017 absolved Venoco LLC - the bankrupt company that had been operating the wells - of any responsibility for clean-up because other creditors took priority. The city of Beverly Hills is contributing another $11 million to the job. “This is an incredible amount of money” siphoned away from education, said Michael Bregy, superintendent of the Beverly Hills Unified School District.State and federal regulations normally require drillers to pay an up-front bond to cover future cleanups if they go belly-up. But the rules are a patchwork, with wildly differing requirements, and they seldom leave governments adequately funded. In Pennsylvania, for example, it would take several thousand years to plug its estimated backlog of 200,000 abandoned oil wells at the current rate of spending, according to data from the state regulator.Oil-industry lobbyists have been fighting state and federal efforts to increase the bonding, arguing it would hurt jobs and economic growth during an already tough time for the industry.“States and the federal government have many sources of funding available to reclaim and plug abandoned wells,” said Reid Porter, a spokesman for the American Petroleum Institute, the country’s largest oil and gas trade group.The API spent $1.44 million in the first quarter of 2020 lobbying on Capitol Hill, with oil well bonding legislation one of the target issues, lobbying disclosures show.The US Government Accountability Office estimates that cleaning up and plugging an abandoned well runs from $20,000 to $145,000, putting the price tag for cleaning up all of America’s abandoned wells somewhere between $60 billion to $435 billion.‘Shooting out of the earth’The pollution threat goes beyond climate change. Leaks from abandoned wells have been found to contaminate groundwater and soil. In extreme cases, gas from abandoned wells has caused explosions.In Ohio and Texas, state regulators have each found an average of around two groundwater contamination incidents per year related to orphaned wells, according to research by the Groundwater Protection Council published in 2011 and dating to the 1980s.In April 2017, for example, neighbors of Ohio farmer Stan Brenneman alerted him to the smell of oil coming from a drainage ditch on his 111-acre corn and soybean farm near the town of Elida, Brenneman told Reuters. The ditch drains water from the farm and carries it into rivers, streams and eventually Lake Erie.Ohio’s Division of Oil & Gas Resources Management excavated 800 feet of the farm’s drainage system to find a well casing - about 130 years old - releasing oil three feet underground. The plugging operation took two months to complete and cost the state $196,915, according to a spokeswoman for the state Department of Natural Resources.More recently, in 2018, the US EPA was alerted to the presence of nearly 50 abandoned oil and gas wells on Navajo Nation lands within the borders of Utah and New Mexico that were bubbling water at the surface. Tests showed the way from some of the wells contained potentially dangerous levels of arsenic, sulfate, benzene and chloride.The Navajo Nation Environmental Protection Agency said plugging the wells would require “major funds” and that, in the meantime, the public had been warned not to drink the water.In rare cases, gas from long-abandoned wells can cause dangerous accidents.In January of last year, a 1930s-era well sent a geyser of gas and dirt 100 feet into the air at the construction site of a Marriott seaside hotel in Marina del Rey, California, an upscale community in the Los Angeles area, according to a state report. The hotel owners did not respond to a request for comment.“It was horrifying,” said resident Marilyn Wall, who witnessed the explosion from her home across the street. She said she was stunned “by the extent and the length of time that the stuff was shooting out of the earth.”A worker standing on a construction platform above the plume was sprayed with debris and scrambled to lower himself down with an escape rope, a video of the explosion shows.Don’t drink the waterFor Hanson and Michael Rowe, their troubles did not end the day their abandoned well was plugged. They no longer drink from the water well on their property because it gives them diarrhea, they said. Michael Rowe said she still suffers from headaches and coughing spells.Kentucky’s Energy and Environment Cabinet is still fighting to recoup the $383,340 cost from the now-defunct J.D. Carty and Blue Energy in an ongoing court battle.An attorney for John Carty, founder of J.D. Carty, said his client had sold what few assets remained in the company and therefore bore no responsibility. A lawyer for Blue Energy said the company denies ever operating the wells on the property and has no responsibility to maintain or plug them.J.D. Carty was only required to have one $50,000 “blanket bond” to cover all its wells in Kentucky. The amount forfeited to pay for the leaky well on Rowe’s land, determined in part by its depth, was just $2,500 - less than 1% of the cost to fix it.After the incident, Kentucky lawmakers passed a bill last year that effectively doubled bond requirements for shallow wells to help cope with the state’s 13,000 abandoned wells. Still, state regulators say the list of wells is growing.Hanson Rowe said he supports fossil fuel development because using natural gas for heat and cooking has improved his quality of life. But the couple say they hope their lawsuit against the companies involved will help change the way the energy industry manages its wells.“You lost your health, you’ve lost it all,” Hanson Rowe said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millions-of-abandoned-oil-wells-are-leaking-methane-a-climate-menace/story-7FNltTOLexNCarHoEpgfuM.html
18-06-2020||World||US authorities debate over masks, personal freedom as Covid-19 cases surge||When the coronavirus flared in China’s capital this week, Beijing cancelled flights, suspended reopenings and described the situation as “extremely grave.” But with cases rising in some US states, local officials have balked at even requiring people to wear masks.In the United States, which has the most confirmed cases and deaths in the world, authorities wrestled Wednesday with balancing demands for constitutional rights and personal freedom with warnings from health officials that being lax will have deadly consequences.China responded to a new outbreak in Beijing by scrapping more than 60% of its flights to the capital, cancelling classes and strengthening requirements for social distancing. It was a sharp retreat for the nation that declared victory over Covid-19 in March.“This has truly rung an alarm bell for us,” Party Secretary Cai Qi told a meeting of Beijing’s Communist Party Standing Committee.China’s actions follow about 137 new cases, a fraction of the number some US states see each day. In Arizona, more than 1,100 people visited emergency rooms on Tuesday alone with positive or suspected cases. Alabama also is running out of hospital space, stirring impassioned debate over a mask requirement. Other states that haven’t mandated face coverings, like Texas and Florida, are seeing infections soar.With masks becoming a political symbol, Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden has taken aim at president Donald Trump’s approach to the pandemic.“Donald Trump wants to style himself as a wartime president. Unlike any other wartime leader, he takes no responsibility, he exercises no leadership, now he has just flat surrendered the fight,” Biden said Wednesday.Biden has worn a mask repeatedly at public events, while Trump hasn’t, even on occasions such as touring auto factory floors when they are required. Aides say Trump believes they’re unflattering and that wearing one projects weakness.The mask debate is playing out nationwide, notably in hard-hit states where face coverings have become a political and cultural debate.Hundreds of medical professionals signed a letter urging Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey to require them. Facing mounting pressure to act as cases surge, the Republican said cities were free to mandate masks.Ducey, who removed his mask before speaking to reporters, said there were vastly different rates of infection across the state.“For some things, a statewide directive or executive order works very well,” he said. “If you have 12 or 13 counties that say ‘pound sand’ on an executive order ... it’s a self-defeating executive order.”Ducey has attributed Arizona’s soaring cases to increased testing. The state has been doing more tests, which can yield more cases, but health experts say a better way to see if more people are getting sick is to look at the percentage of positive tests. When that percentage rises, it means the outbreak is worsening — not just that more people are getting tested.Arizona has the nation’s highest seven-day average positive test rate: 17.7%, or about double the national average and well above the 10% threshold that health officials find worrisome. It also has the most new cases per capita in the US in the past 14 days. The state’s leading hospital system says it’s almost running out of beds.Ducey said roughly 300 National Guardsmen would help with contact tracing. Several restaurants and other businesses have closed because staff tested positive in the last week.The same thing is happening in parts of Florida, where people under 35 are testing positive at a higher rate since the pandemic began, contributing to a surge in cases, officials said Wednesday.The coastal city of St. Petersburg had three popular bars close after employees tested positive, and it’s now requiring workers who have contact with the public to wear masks — which some hard-hit cities in southern Florida have been doing for weeks.Mayor Rick Kriseman said he also plans to require people to cover their faces in businesses and other public spaces.“We can wear a mask, protect others and ourselves, or we can contribute to someone’s death. Maybe even our own,” Kriseman said.The Democrat said Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has encouraged people to use masks but not mandated them.DeSantis said he has no intention of closing Florida’s economy again despite the statewide spike in new cases, which topped 1,000 Wednesday for the 15th consecutive day. He said many of those getting sick are young and unlikely to suffer serious illness or death.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.Fears about growing numbers of infections in younger people pushed officials in the San Antonio area to order masks in public as infections keep rising in Texas.“What we are doing here is to protect the life and safety of the San Antonio community,” Mayor Ron Nirenberg said, adding that most infections in the area are in people younger than 40.Later Wednesday, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, said local governments could force businesses to require customers and workers to wear masks but that he wouldn’t issue a statewide order. The second-most-populated state set daily records for new Covid-19 cases, with 3,129, and hospitalizations. The 2,793 hospitalizations mark a daily high for the 10th time in 11 days.In Montgomery, Alabama, where cases are spiking, the issue of masks erupted during a City Council meeting, where members rejected a proposal to mandate them at public gatherings of 25 or more.Dr. Bill Saliski, a lung specialist at Jackson Hospital in Montgomery, called on the city to pass a mask requirement and declared: “If this continues the way we’re going, we’re going to be overrun.”Some city leaders voiced concern about trampling on people’s rights.“I think to make somebody do something or require somebody to wear something is an overreach,” councilman Brantley Lyons said.Since the virus emerged in China late last year and spread worldwide, there have been more than 8.3 million confirmed cases and over 447,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the true toll is much higher. The U.S. death toll has exceeded 117,000.European nations, which embarked on a wide-scale reopening this week, watched Asia and the Americas with trepidation.After lockdown restrictions were relaxed in Iran, Health Minister Saeed Namaki said he realized the extent of the challenge when he took a domestic flight.“Many people have become careless, frustrated with wearing masks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-authorities-debate-over-masks-personal-freedom-as-covid-19-cases-surge/story-DjCvszOa6jEiwzMzQOHXUL.html

Underground swimming pools and gyms will have to be closed.“Basketball, volleyball, football and other group sports are forbidden,” the official news agency, Xinhua, reported quoting the notice.The national health commission (NHC) has deployed in Beijing a team of experts with experience in fighting the outbreak in the central Chinese city of Wuhan where the coronavirus first emerged late last year.The team will guide the local authorities in community management, tracing contacts and preventing the spread of the infection in hospitals.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Overall, 28 confirmed cases were detected in the mainland for June 17, including four imported.North China’s Hebei province, bordering Beijing, reported two new Covid-19 cases and three asymptomatic patients on Wednesday, all of whom are related to the Beijing Xinfadi market.The virus is said to have been detected on a salmon fish chopping board.Beijing’s neighbouring city Tianjin reported one new covid-19 case on Wednesday night; that of a 22-year-old man working at Tianjin’s Conrad Hotel, according to Chinese state media.“The patient has been responsible for dishwashing since May 30, occasionally cleaning frozen seafood. All 93 close contacts have been quarantined for medical observation,” the state media report said.Following Beijing’s decision to raise its epidemic response to Level II from Level III on Tuesday, and after four provinces reported confirmed cases related to the capital city’s new outbreak, 31 provinces and regions in China have tightened health checks on arrivals from Beijing.At least one city, Harbin in northeast China, said arrivals from Beijing’s risk areas would have to go through a 14-day centralised quarantine, a week of home quarantine and four nucleic acid and one serum test during that period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-experts-called-in-as-beijing-reports-158-covid-19-cases-in-a-week/story-LrgzVO48vkB53dFGsHfMyJ.html

Mexico and India were elected unopposed. Kenya and Djibouti were competing for the final seat, but there was no clear winner. To ensure geographical representation, seats are allocated to regional groups. But even if candidates are running unopposed in their group, they still need to win the support of more than two thirds of the UN General Assembly.The new members will start their two-year term on the 15-member council on Jan. 1. After operating virtually since March amid the coronavirus pandemic, diplomats - wearing masks and social distancing - returned to the General Assembly hall on Wednesday to cast their secret ballots at allotted times. They also elected - unopposed - Turkish diplomat Volkan Bozkir as the president of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly. He will take up the role later this year.The Security Council is the only UN body that can make legally binding decisions like imposing sanctions and authorizing the use of force.

18-06-2020||World||Consult allies on future troop plans, NATO chief tells US||The United States remains committed to its European allies and has pledged to consult them on any future US troop moves in Europe, NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Wednesday, after President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement that he plans to pull thousands of personnel out of Germany.Trump said Monday that he is ordering a major reduction in troop strength in Germany, from around 34,500 personnel down to 25,000. Members of his own party have criticized the move as a gift to Russia and a threat to US national security. Germany is a hub for US operations in the Middle East and Africa.Speaking after chairing a video meeting of NATO defense ministers, Stoltenberg said that Defense Secretary Mark Esper “stated very strongly that of course the US stays committed to European security, and the United States will consult with other allies as we move forward.”“No final decision has been made on how and when to implement the US intention,” Stoltenberg said.Germany wasn’t notified of the move, which came after Trump branded its NATO ally “delinquent” for failing to pay enough for its own defense, by falling short of a goal set in 2014 for members to halt budget cuts and move toward spending at least 2% of gross national product on defense by 2024.A number of NATO diplomats and officials have suggested the pullout — which would be costly and might not even be logistically possible before the US elections in November — probably won’t happen.Stoltenberg said that the United States and Poland, in consultation with NATO, had decided to boost the US troop presence there, but he provided no details.Asked whether European allies and Canada are concerned that Trump might announce a complete troop withdrawal from Afghanistan as the election approaches, NATO’s top civilian official said only that Esper had given the ministers a detailed briefing on US plans.Stoltenberg said more talks will take place among NATO allies and their partners in the conflict-ravaged country, but that any drawdown would be based on whether the Taliban are complying with their commitments to the peace agreement.Separately, the ministers endorsed a series of measures they’ve been preparing for more than a year to respond to Russia’s development of nuclear capable medium-range missiles and hypersonic weapons, and what NATO says is Moscow’s intimidation of European allies.Stoltenberg said a number of allies are buying new air and missile defense systems and some are investing in advanced fighter aircraft. The 30-nation military alliance is also boosting its intelligence gathering and sharing, and plans more war games.Stoltenberg said the ministers also “decided on additional steps to keep the NATO nuclear deterrent safe, secure and effective,” without elaborating. But he insisted that NATO countries don’t plan to “mirror Russia” by deploying new land-based nuclear missiles in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/consult-allies-on-future-troop-plans-nato-chief-tells-us/story-HfRMWZ5eDFOR9roDilA1hO.html
18-06-2020||World||Donald Trump ‘pleaded’ with Xi Jinping to help him get reelected: John Bolton||President Donald Trump “pleaded” with China’s Xi Jinping during a 2019 summit to help his reelection prospects, according to a scathing new book by former Trump adviser John Bolton that accuses the president of being driven by political calculations when making national security decisions.The White House worked furiously to block the book, asking a federal court for an emergency temporary restraining order Wednesday against its release.Bolton’s allegations that Trump solicited Chinese help for his reelection effort carried echoes of Trump’s attempt to get political help from Ukraine, which led to his impeachment.“I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn’t driven by re-election calculations,” Bolton wrote.The 577-page book paints an unvarnished portrait of Trump and his administration, amounting to the most vivid, first-person account yet of how Trump conducts himself in office. Several other former officials have written books, but most have been flattering about the president. Other former officials have indicated they were saving their accounts of their time working for Trump until after he left office in order to speak more candidly. The Associated Press obtained a copy of Bolton’s book in advance of its release next week.Bolton, Trump’s national security adviser for a 17-month period, called Trump’s attempt to shift the June 2019 conversation with Xi to the US election a stunning move, and wrote that it was among innumerable conversations that he found concerning. He added that Congress should have expanded the scope of its impeachment inquiry to these other incidents.Deeply critical of the president and much of his senior team, Bolton wrote that because staff had served him so poorly, Trump “saw conspiracies behind rocks, and remained stunningly uninformed on how to run the White House, let alone the huge federal government.” He added that while he was at the White House, Trump typically had only two intelligence briefings a week “and in most of those, he spoke at greater length than the briefers, often on matters completely unrelated to the subjects at hand.”The book also includes embarrassing claims that Trump thought Finland was part of Russia, didn’t know that the United Kingdom was a nuclear power and called reporters “scumbags” who should be “executed.”As for the meeting with the Chinese president in Osaka, Japan, Bolton wrote that Trump told Xi that Democrats were hostile to China.“He then, stunningly, turned the conversation to the coming U.S. presidential election, alluding to China’s economic capability to affect the ongoing campaigns, pleading with Xi to ensure he’d win,” Bolton said. “He stressed the importance of farmers, and increased Chinese purchases of soybeans and wheat in the electoral outcome.”Bolton wrote that he would print Trump’s exact words, “but the government’s pre-publication review process has decided otherwise.”The book, titled “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” is set to be released Tuesday by Simon & Schuster. It has been the subject of a lengthy battle between Bolton and the White House.The Justice Department filed suit Tuesday in an effort to delay publication of the book, claiming it still contained highly classified information and that a required review by the National Security Council had not been concluded. According to the filing, a career official determined no classified material remained in April, but national security adviser Robert O’Brien initiated a secondary review that deemed additional information to be classified.The White House’s contention that so much of the book was classified appeared to be a tacit admission that many of Bolton’s allegations were accurate — as inaccurate information could not be classified.Bolton wrote that, due to the review process, he made “numerous changes to the manuscript in order to obtain clearance to publish, the vast bulk of which, in my view, did not change the facts set forth.” He said in some cases he was asked to add phrases like, “in my view,” to make it clear he was expressing his opinion instead of relying on sensitive information. In others, he was asked to describe things more generally. He was asked to remove quotation marks nearly every time he recounts conversation between Trump and foreign leaders and himself and foreign leaders.US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said Wednesday that he attended a meeting between Trump and Xi at the Group of 20 nations in Osaka, but he never heard Trump pleading with Xi to buy more agriculture products to ensure he would win reelection. Lighthizer spoke at a Senate hearing on trade issues and was asked about Bolton’s recollection of events.“Absolutely untrue. Never happened. I was there. I have no recollection of that ever happening. I don’t believe it’s true. I don’t believe it ever happened,” Lighthizer said. “Would I recollect something as crazy as that? Of course, I would recollect it.”Bolton wrote that he raised some of his concerns about Trump’s conversations with foreign leaders with Attorney General William Barr, and flagged similar worries with White House attorneys and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.“The pattern looked like obstruction of justice as a way of life, which we couldn’t accept,” he wrote.Justice Department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec denied in a statement that Barr had ever expressed that Trump’s conversations with foreign leaders were improper.Trump continually pandered to Xi, Bolton wrote. At a White House Christmas dinner in 2018, Bolton said Trump asked why the US was sanctioning China over its treatment of Uighurs. China suspects Uighurs, who are predominantly Muslim and culturally and ethnically distinct from the majority Han Chinese population, of harboring separatist tendencies. In recent years, China has dramatically escalated its campaign against them by detaining more than 1 million people in internment camps and prisons, which it calls vocational training centers.“At the opening dinner of the Osaka G-20 meeting, with only interpreters present, Xi explained to Trump why he was basically building concentration camps in Xinjiang,” Bolton wrote. “According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do. “Bolton’s claim that Trump was appealing to China to assist his reelection effort comes as the president’s rhetoric toward the US geopolitical rival has grown more acerbic in response to the coronavirus pandemic. But it may undercut the Trump reelection campaign’s efforts, evidenced in recent television ads and public statements to paint presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden as soft on China.In the book, Bolton describes every Trump decision as being guided by concerns for his own reelection, a claim that evokes the scandal that sparked Trump’s impeachment last year.The book alleges that Trump directly tied providing military aid to Ukraine to the country’s willingness to conduct investigations into the Bidens. In one conversation, Trump said “he wasn’t in favor of sending them anything until all the Russia-investigation materials related to Clinton and Biden had been turned over,” Bolton writes.Trump’s decision to withhold military assistance to Ukraine until it agreed to investigate Biden led the House to charge Trump was abusing his power. The aid was ultimately released once the hold-up became public. The GOP-controlled Senate ultimately acquitted the president on that count and a count of obstructing Congress’ investigation of the incident.Bolton was called to testify before House lawmakers conducting the impeachment inquiry, but he declined, suggesting he wanted a federal court to decide whether he should heed a White House directive not to cooperate with the inquiry.The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the specifics in Bolton’s book, but emailed reporters past quotes of Democratic lawmakers impugning the former Trump aide’s credibility. In advance of the public reports about the details, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the book was “full of classified information, which is inexcusable.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-pleaded-with-china-s-xi-jinping-to-help-him-get-reelected-john-bolton/story-TFvdFi9j45j8RbTUQ1N2TM.html
18-06-2020||World||Beijing Covid-19 outbreak poses test for China’s chairman of everything||As Chinese officials in Wuhan struggled to contain a deadly coronavirus outbreak in January, it was Xi Jinping who stepped in and took control. Now, the president who declared himself personally responsible for every aspect of the China’s response to the pandemic faces fresh test: a rapidly growing outbreak in Beijing.The cluster of more than 130 cases in the city that is the seat of Communist Party power risks undermining the government’s narrative it handled the epidemic better than many western nations. It could upend its nascent economic recovery if it turns into a second wave. The stakes are even higher for Xi, who has staked his credibility on China’s response and sought to frame himself as a global leader in the crisis -- to the chagrin of nations from the US to Australia.It comes as Xi grapples with external challenges, too. He’s navigating a US president in the midst of a re-election campaign who has taken to frequent outbursts against China on everything from trade to Covid-19 to Beijing’s growing influence on Hong Kong. On Thursday, Trump signed legislation into law requiring US sanctions for Chinese officials found responsible for mass detentions of Uighurs and members of other Muslim minority groups.And now China is embroiled in a risky spat with neighbouring India after an altercation in a remote, border area of the Himalayas left 20 Indian soldiers and an unknown number of Chinese troops dead. In recent years Xi has essentially made himself “chairman of everything,” which risks complex issues becoming bottlenecked as he seeks to handle them personally. It also means that any missteps could be seen as his own.“This poses challenges for Xi as he has to carefully navigate through both a domestic economic slowdown and external pressures of being gradually isolated by the whole Western world,” said Chen Daoyin, a political commentator and former professor at the Shanghai University of Political Science and Law. “If China proves its model to be successful again, it will earn more credit globally and at home.”Xi was banking on that when in February, at the height of China’s epidemic, the rare release of internal speeches showed he was personally leading the government’s response, including ordering the lockdown of about 60 million people in Hubei province at great economic and social cost.In the months that followed, it appeared Xi had been validated. New cases dropped as officials implemented strict quarantine, surveillance and testing measures. Public anger over local officials’ initial response turned to nationalist pride as governments around the world struggled in turn to contain their own outbreaks.The resurgence of cases in Beijing threatens to undo that success. Infections have already spread to at least four other provinces, all stemming from the city’s largest wholesale market. Gao Fu, head of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said it’s likely the virus had been spreading a month before it was discovered last week.More ManageableStill, the city has so far refrained from the citywide lockdowns that China employed to stem the spread of Covid-19 in Wuhan and in the northeast region in a bid to minimize disruption to the country’s most important city. Officials are instead relying on an aggressive contract tracing campaign to identify and isolate people who had contact with the market.They also have more infrastructure in place this time around, including the ability to conduct more than 90,000 tests a day and a “health code” system available through residents’ cellphones that can show whether someone is at risk of being infected.“We think the second wave is more manageable than the first wave,” said Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley Asia. “The more active surveillance and improved testing and contact tracing will likely result in selective rather than massive lockdowns,” he said, allowing “economic activity in most regions of China to resume while keeping public health challenges in check.”But avoiding economic pain isn’t Xi’s only consideration. In February, he warned government and party officials that they had to “spare no effort” to contain a cluster that broke out in the Beijing’s West District -- home to central party and government compound Zhongnanhai.“The safety and stability of the capital city directly concerns the broader outlook for the party and the country,” he said.Cai Qi, Beijing’s party chief and a close ally of Xi, on Tuesday vowed to “resolutely contain the virus.” He urged cadres to “take strict precautions, maintain social stability and make sure no serious incidents happen again,” according to the official Xinhua News Agency.Beijing has since then moved to close down schools, reinstate strict restrictions in housing compounds and limit outbound trains and flights. Local officials warned on Wednesday that more cases will be reported in the coming days.The source of the outbreak remains unclear, though Chinese officials have indicated they think it came from Europe. Salmon is being boycotted in China after the virus was traced to the chopping board of a vendor selling the imported seafood and authorities are testing some food imports before allowing them in the country, even though scientists say that there’s no evidence that food can transmit the pathogen.External ChallengesThe outbreak in Beijing comes as Xi faces criticism from other nations even as he seeks to tout the advantages of the Chinese approach. On Wednesday, China and India sought to defuse their dispute, even as each side blamed the other for causing the border clash and as their local media whipped up nationalist fervor.With Stones and Iron Rods, India-China Border Clash Turns Deadly“This is a time when you think that Beijing would want to stabilize its periphery, ease up on confrontation, and focus on the major issues” like the economy and unemployment, Daniel Russel, a former U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, told Bloomberg Television. “And yet the border with India is not the only place where China is throwing punches.”Covid-19 cases are likely to keep rising as China embarks on a series of high-profile international meetings meant to burnish its virus-fighting credentials. On Wednesday, Xi hosted a summit about battling the virus with African nations, before a high-level Belt and Road video conference scheduled for Thursday. A virtual China-EU officials meeting is set for next week.Chen, the political commentator, said the pandemic has “fundamentally changed” China’s relationship with the west.“China faces threats of breaking up global supply chains, the possibility of a new Cold War with the west and its authoritarian rule clashes with the ideology of the free world,” he said. “How China navigates through such a predicament is the question Xi has to answer.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-covid-19-outbreak-poses-test-for-china-s-chairman-of-everything/story-xM5iEaUkFsWvP5EmtNQJ9N.html
18-06-2020||World||New Zealand enters first recession since 2010 as coronavirus bites||New Zealand entered recession for the first time in almost a decade as the coronavirus pandemic led to the nation’s biggest quarterly contraction in 29 years.Gross domestic product fell 1.6% in the first quarter from the fourth, Statistics New Zealand said Thursday in Wellington. That’s the largest decline since 1991 and more than the 1% expected by economists. From a year earlier, the economy shrank 0.2% -- the first annual contraction since 2009.New Zealand is bracing for a severe contraction in the three months through June after it responded to the pandemic by closing its border and imposing a strict nationwide lockdown that stayed in place until mid-May. The government has pledged NZ$62 billion ($40 billion) of fiscal support to help revive domestic demand and protect jobs, while the central bank has slashed interest rates and embarked on quantitative easing to drive down borrowing costs.“We are expecting the bulk of the economic impact to hit in the second quarter,” said Jane Turner, senior economist at ASB Bank in Auckland, who tips a 17% contraction. “The labor market is set to deteriorate markedly with unemployment set to rise above 8%. The weaker labor market and job security concerns will likely result in many households becoming more cautious about spending over the coming year.”The New Zealand dollar was little changed after the GDP report. It bought 64.50 U.S. cents at 11:24 a.m. in Wellington.The initial impact of the Covid-19 outbreak began in early February with a travel ban imposed on arrivals from China and exporters facing difficulties in their supply chains. Tourism started to experience the pain as border measures were stepped up after the first case of Covid-19 was discovered on Feb. 28. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern eventually took the unprecedented step of closing the border to all foreigners on March 19.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Only in the final week of the quarter, on March 25, was the nation placed into lockdown, requiring almost all retailers other than supermarkets to close and shutting down building sites and most factories.Bank economists predict the economy will contract by as much as 19% in the second quarter, confirming New Zealand’s first recession since the second half of 2010. Some have scaled back the severity of the expected slump after the country succeeded in eliminating the virus and came out of lockdown earlier than anticipated, partially reviving consumer confidence and giving a fillip to retail spending.The first-quarter contraction was driven by service industries, particularly hospitality as international travel stopped, the statistics agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-enters-first-recession-since-2010-as-coronavirus-bites/story-9CNEgNvOmBS25CTlM1zsTK.html
18-06-2020||World||Trump OKs bill to punish China over ethnic crackdown||President Donald Trump signed legislation Wednesday that seeks to punish China for a crackdown on ethnic minorities, even as a new book by former national security adviser John Bolton said the American leader expressed support for the brutal campaign in a private conversation with his Chinese counterpart. The Uighur Human Rights Policy Act of 2020 passed with overwhelming support from Republicans and Democrats in Congress. Trump signed it with no ceremony, issuing a statement in which he said a sanctions provision intruded on executive authority and he would regard it as non-binding.Still, Uighur activists see the approval as an important step. It is the first time any government has sought to punish China for a campaign of mass surveillance and detention of Uighurs and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the western Xinjiang region.“Globally this should be a model for other counties who have been very lukewarm in their response to the ongoing atrocities in the Uighur region,” said Nury Turkel, a Uighur activist and member of the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom.The bill, which includes sanctions on Chinese officials directly involved in the crackdown, was expected to further inflame already tense relations with China amid the Trump administration’s criticism of Beijing’s response to the outbreak of the coronavirus.The signing came as Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was meeting in Hawaii with a senior Chinese diplomat, and as revelations from the soon-to-be-released Bolton book were emerging.The former national security adviser said Trump asked at a White House Christmas dinner in 2018 why the U.S. wanted to sanction China over the treatment of the Uighurs, who are ethnically and culturally distinct from the country’s majority Han population and are suspected by the Chinese government of harboring separatist tendencies.Bolton wrote that at the opening dinner of the Osaka G-20 meeting in 2019, with only interpreters present, Chinese President Xi Jinping explained the Chinese campaign to Trump.“According to our interpreter, Trump said that Xi should go ahead with building the camps, which he thought was exactly the right thing to do,” Bolton wrote.Bolton said another National Security Council official, Matthew Pottinger, told him Trump had made a similar remark during his 2017 trip to China, “which meant we could cross repression of the Uighurs off our list of possible reasons to sanction China, at least as long as trade negotiations continued.”Trump issued a statement upon signing the legislation Wednesday that the new law would hold “perpetrators of human rights violations” accountable.Members of Congress intended the legislation to increase pressure on China over the crackdown in Xinjiang, where authorities have detained more than a million people — from ethnic groups that include Uighurs, Kazakhs and Kyrgyz — in a vast network of detention centers. Many have been subjected to torture and forced labor and deprived of adequate food and medical treatment.The law would impose sanctions on specific Chinese officials, such as the Communist Party official who oversees government policy in Xinjiang. Trump said in his signing statement that a provision dictating when sanctions could be terminated interfered with executive authority and would be considered non-binding.Even with the signing statement, Turkel said the measure is “still an effective legal mechanism to address human rights abuses” and he thanked members of Congress for their support.Sen. Jeff Merkley, a co-sponsor of the legislation, said the act requires the secretary of state to determine whether individuals responsible for “appalling human rights violations” meet the criteria for sanctions. “The United States cannot remain silent in the face of these atrocious and horrifying abuses,” the Oregon Democrat said. “As millions of Americans fight for racial justice here at home, we must also stand strong as a champion of human rights abroad.”The legislation also requires the U.S. government to report to Congress on the human rights violations in Xinjiang as well as China’s acquisition of technology used for mass detention and surveillance. It also requires American authorities to look into the pervasive reports of harassment and threats of Uighurs and other Chinese nationals in the United States.China has publicly brushed away criticism of its crackdown in Xinjiang, which it launched in 2014 as the “Strike Hard Against Violent Extremism” campaign in the vast resource-rich territory in the far northwest of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-oks-bill-to-punish-china-over-ethnic-crackdown/story-xiafxSFAeHqUCMaltswd1K.html
18-06-2020||World||NASA’s next Mars rover honours medical teams fighting coronavirus||NASA’s next Mars rover is honouring all the medical workers on the front lines of the coronavirus battle around the world.With just another month until liftoff, the space agency on Wednesday revealed a commemorative plate attached to the rover, aptly named Perseverance.The rover team calls it the Covid-19 Perseverance plate, designed in the last couple months.The black and white aluminum plate — 3-by-5 inches (8-by-13 centimetres) — shows planet Earth atop a staff entwined with a serpent, a symbol of the medical community. The path of the spacecraft also is depicted, with its origin from Cape Canaveral.Health care workers were “on front lines keeping us safe” during launch preparations, said deputy project manager Matt Wallace of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.“They really inspired us, I think, through this period, and we hope that this plate and we hope that this mission in some small way can inspire them in return,” Wallace told reporters. The rover’s name, Perseverance, has taken on added meaning the last few months, according to NASA officials. It’s hard enough preparing a spacecraft for Mars, but doing it in the middle of a pandemic made it even harder, Wallace said.Additional work shifts were added to reduce the number of people working on the rover at any one time and ensure social distancing. Others had to work from home.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageNASA is pressing ahead with a July 20 launch, even as the number of Covid-19 cases continue to rise in Florida. This mission — to seek signs of past microbial life on Mars and collect rock and soil samples for eventual return to Earth — is considered essential by the space agency.If the rover isn’t launched by mid-August, it would need to wait until 2022 when Earth and Mars are back in proper alignment. A two-year delay could add another USD500 million to the nearly USD3 billion mission.Unlike for SpaceX’s first astronaut launch late last month, NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine isn’t urging the public to stay home and watch online to avoid crowds.“It appears they didn’t listen to us,” Bridenstine said. “So we’re asking people to follow all of the necessary guidelines to keep themselves safe and we’re trusting that they will.” Perseverance is one of three upcoming missions to Mars. The United Arab Emirates and China also are preparing spacecraft for launch to the red planet by mid-August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-s-next-mars-rover-honours-medical-teams-fighting-virus/story-Pz5Kv0gXWoJra11DlpGdaJ.html
18-06-2020||World||Kim Jong Un leaves South Korean leader’s peace legacy in ruins||When North and South Korea opened their first liaison office less than two years ago, President Moon Jae-in in Seoul declared a “new era has dawned.” This week, Kim Jong Un showed him how little had changed when he reduced the $15 million building to rubble.The shocking act of destruction, which a Moon spokesman denounced as “reckless,” appeared to be part of a calculated gamble to try to force the South Korean president to break with the US and support sanctions relief for North Korea. The result was to literally blow up the most concrete achievement of Moon’s decades-long drive to establish a lasting peace with his country’s greatest foe.Kim wasn’t finished. On Wednesday, the North Korean military announced plans to reoccupy sensitive border areas, undermining an historic flurry of agreements in 2018 that fueled talk of a Nobel Peace Prize. A North Korea official dismissed the deals as “scrap paper,” describing Moon as the “chief culprit” for their failure. The regime promised more provocations in the future.While North Korea has a long history of diplomatic reversals, few have been as extreme as Kim’s union and breakup with Moon. The relationship’s collapse brings back the specter of military conflict on the Korean Peninsula and leaves the South Korean president just two more years in office to put the Cold War rivals back on a path toward peace.The dispute underscores a fundamental dilemma facing all South Korean leaders: how to reconcile their policies toward Pyongyang with the geopolitical interests of their allies in Washington. Despite his own trade and security frictions with President Donald Trump, Moon has so far chosen to preserve the alliance with the U.S. at the expense of his ties with Kim.“He does not want to get in trouble with the United States and he does not want to get in trouble with North Korea,” Andrei Lankov, a professor at Kookmin University who is a specialist on North Korea, told Bloomberg Television. “But trouble with the United States is a far greater problem for him.”The political cost for Moon, 67, was unclear. Global praise for South Korea’s coronavirus response helped propel Moon’s left-leaning Democratic Party to a historic majority in parliamentary elections in April and lift his approval rating to a record high. Some 62% approved of his performance before the latest North Korea crisis began, according to a Gallup tracking poll.South Korea’s top nuclear envoy, Lee Do-hoon, arrived in Washington Wednesday for talks with U.S. officials about North Korea’s latest provocations, Yonhap News Agency reported.Some opposition members argue that Moon’s accommodation efforts with North Korea backfired. Hong Moon-pyo, a senior lawmaker with the conservative United Future Party, urged Moon to overhaul his North Korea policy, saying it had led to provocations such as the regime’s tests of new missiles designed to strike all of South Korea.“Seoul appeared weak, and gave Pyongyang a waiver,” Hong said. “The response was simply just not strong enough.”Moon, the son of North Korean refugees who settled in South Korea during the 1950-53 Korean War, had spent much of his career working toward peace on the peninsula. He was among a group of acolytes determined to preserve late President Kim Dae-jung’s “Sunshine Policy” toward Pyongyang and served as President Roh Moo-hyun’s chief of staff during an inter-Korean summit in 2007.After sailing into office in 2017 in the wake of conservative President Park Geun-hye’s ouster, Moon pledged to forge a deal that could one day unify the peninsula. It was an optimistic message as Kim carried out an escalating series of missile tests and Trump threatened to unleash “fire and fury” against the Pyongyang.In less than a year, Moon was shaking hands with Kim and bounding across their heavily fortified border in the first of several summits with the North Korean leader. Moon was hailed as the man who helped pull Trump and Kim back from the brink of a conflict that could devastate Seoul and draw the U.S. and China into war.Things began to unravel early in 2019 after Trump walked out of a summit with Kim in Hanoi, rejecting his offer to give up the aging Yongbyon nuclear facility in exchange for sanctions relief. It was a framework that Moon had endorsed after meeting Kim in Pyongyang. Weeks after the Hanoi debacle, Kim dismissed Moon as an “officious mediator.”After that, Moon saw his overtures to Kim repeatedly rejected as the South Korean military tracked a resurgence in weapons tests north of the border. More recently, North Korea started threatening to roll back Moon’s signature achievements including building the liaison office, removing front-line guard posts and enforcing a ban on military exercises near the border.‘Tactless, Sinister’Worse, Kim’s top aides are ruling out future meetings with Moon. Kim Yo Jong -- Kim’s sister and new point person for South Korean affairs -- rejected Moon’s offer to send special envoys to North Korea as a “tactless and sinister proposal.”Moon doesn’t have much he can offer without risking a blowup with the Trump administration, which has rejected South Korea’s calls for sanctions relief. The U.S. has refused to relax United Nations penalties and other measures against the regime without greater commitments on arms reduction.Trade between the two Koreas has dropped to virtually zero from $2.7 billion in 2015, or about 10% of North Korea’s economy. North Korea took a further hit this year when it sealed off its borders in January at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, crimping his remaining trade with countries like China.If Trump doesn’t win re-election in November, things could get even more difficult for Moon. Few other U.S. politicians have been so enthusiastic about meeting Kim, whose aides have spoken of a “mysteriously wonderful” chemistry between the two leaders.There might not be much more for Moon to do, Lankov said, except “sit tight, smile broadly and try to play out the crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-leaves-south-korean-leader-s-peace-legacy-in-ruins/story-3ZWqqaT5qHjYMUXXyVWiXN.html
18-06-2020||World||Many fear Trump’s visit to Tulsa could spark violence||Black community leaders in Tulsa said they fear a large rally by President Donald Trump in the city this weekend could spark violence, and the state’s governor asked Trump not to visit the site of a race massacre where up to 300 black residents were killed by white mobs in 1921.Tens of thousands of Trump supporters are expected in Tulsa Saturday for the first of a series of rallies across the country to rev up his reelection campaign. The gathering at the 19,000-seat BOK Center, and at a 40,000-capacity convention center nearby, would overlap a two-day local celebration of Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the country.Both events are in the city’s downtown area. The Rev. Al Sharpton is among the speakers at the Juneteenth observance in the Greenwood district, where several dozen blocks of black-owned businesses were burned in the massacre. A separate anti-hate rally is set for Saturday night in a Tulsa park about a 30-minute walk away.Community leaders and organisers say all the events should be peaceful, but worry about the potential for clash involving Trump supporters, participants in several anti-Trump protests planned downtown, and those attending the Juneteenth program. Tulsa experienced several days of large protests after the death of black Minneapolis resident George Floyd May 25, but violence and damage were limited.“We’re all terribly concerned,” said Rev. Ray Owens, pastor of the Metropolitan Baptist Church, a historically black church on the city’s north side. “I’m hearing rumors of people coming from both sides who may be inclined to incite some kind of physical conflict or war of words. That worries me.” Wednesday, the QuikTrip convenience store chain announced the closing of its downtown area locations “out of possible safety concerns for our employees.” Up to 250 Oklahoma Army National Guardsmen will be activated as a “force multiplier” for local, state and federal law enforcement providing security, said Tulsa Police Chief Wendell Franklin.Tulsa’s long history of racial tension was exacerbated in recent weeks by the arrest of two black teenagers for jaywalking. Another flashpoint was the fatal shooting of an unarmed black man, Terence Crutcher, by a Tulsa police officer in 2016.“All of those things are the backdrop for Donald Trump’s visit,” said Marq Lewis, a black community organizer and founder of We the People Oklahoma. “His visit is definitely inflammatory.” Adding to the tension is fear about a recent spike in coronavirus cases in Tulsa and how it could be worsened by throngs of people cramming into downtown and indoor arenas.Oklahoma’s Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt had invited Trump and Vice President Mike Pence to tour the city’s Greenwood district during their visit, then backpedaled after being told it was a bad idea.He said he doesn’t know what Trump will do. “That is something that will ultimately be the President’s decision,” Stitt said.Trump supporters started arriving from around the country as early as Monday, some camping outside the BOK Center in the 90-degree-plus heat. Several acknowledged concerns about violence between rally goers and protesters.“That is in the back of everyone’s mind down here,” said 41-year-old Trump supporter Delmer Phillips. “We know that if protesters show up, it could get nasty. That’s ultimately what I fear the most.” State Sen. Kevin Matthews, a Democrat whose district includes the Greenwood area, said Stitt didn’t consult community members before extending the offer. An appearance in Greenwood by Trump would be “a slap in face,” he said.Meanwhile, Franklin said there will be a massive police presence downtown Saturday.“The eyes of the world are on Tulsa, Oklahoma, during this event and we are ready for it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/many-fear-trump-s-visit-to-tulsa-could-spark-violence/story-jbOVPYn8GZ2y0JhzeFHFgJ.html
18-06-2020||World||EU leader vows to fight lack of diversity in EU institutions||The European Union’s top official acknowledged a lack of racial and ethnic diversity within the bloc’s institutions as she pledged Wednesday to keep talking about racism and discrimination.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said during a discussion at the European Parliament about racism and police violence that she wants to “get to the bottom of these questions.”“Let us look around us, here in this very hemicycle,” von der Leyen said in a speech delivered at the horseshoe-shaped EU legislature. “The diversity of our society is not represented. And I will be the first to admit, things are not better in the College of Commissioners, nor among the European Commission staff.”The College of Commissioners, which oversees EU policies, is made of 27 members, one from each EU country. All the members of the team set up by von der Leyen are white.“This is why I say: we need to talk about racism. And we need to act,” von der Leyen said. “It is always possible to change direction if there is a will to do so.”European lawmakers are set to vote Friday on a resolution related to the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes as he pleaded for air and eventually stopped moving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-leader-vows-to-fight-lack-of-diversity-in-eu-institutions/story-h16Wp27OV39T18KgHEqynN.html
