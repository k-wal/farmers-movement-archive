The review into Labour’s worst election result since 1935 blames several factors for the defeat, including lack of clarity on its Brexit position, a ‘toxic culture’ of conflict within the party, and negative perceptions of the former leader, Jeremy Corbyn.Once a natural party of preference of the Indian community due to its largely pro-immigration policies, Labour has been haemorrhaging support since the early 2000s to the Conservatives, particularly from the young, aspirational second and third generations.The review says that Labour retained a ‘strong advantage’ among Black and Minority Ethnic voters, winning 64 per cent of BME voters against the Conservatives’ 20 per cent, adding that it retained a comparatively high proportion (over 80 per cent) of Labour 2017 election voters identifying as Arab, white and black Caribbean, Bangladeshi and Pakistani, compared to 73 per cent of voters identifying as White British.On Indian community voters, it says: “Retention rates among voters who identified as Indian were even lower, however, at 68 per cent – likely reflecting the growing support for the Conservatives among voters identifying as Hindu”.“Hindu voters who had supported Labour in 2017 were 42 per cent likely to withdraw their support in 2019 – compared to Muslim voters who were 80 per cent likely to stick with Labour”, it adds.The 2019 election was clouded by resentment in the Indian community about the party’s stand on Jammu and Kashmir and claims that some of its MPs and members joined or supported large demonstrations outside India House that turned violent on August 15 and September 3.The developments not only angered large sections of the community, but also led to a diplomatic row with New Delhi, which rejected a resolution on Jammu and Kashmir adopted at the party’s annual conference before the election.The review says: “Labour has a mountain to climb to get back into power in the next five years. This report lays out in stark detail the scale of that task. Unless as a party and a movement we face up to that we will not win”.“In the words of our candidates and activists, the strategy was inadequate, the organisation was muddled and the execution was poor….It would be a mistake to believe that a different leader, with Brexit no longer the defining issue, would in itself be sufficient to change Labour’s electoral fortunes”.Ed Miliband, former party leader, was one of the key party MPs involved in the review.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-indians-turned-against-labour-says-2019-uk-poll-review/story-gATRnojAwv1o8PkD1DxOvK.html

A vast fuel tank lost pressure on May 29 and unleashed 21,000 tonnes of diesel into rivers and subsoil near the city of Norilsk, an incident that Greenpeace has compared to the devastating 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill off Alaska.“Russia has not yet had experience of clearing up such vast pollution from bodies of water as far as I understand,” Putin told officials on state television. It will take at least 10 years for biodiversity in the waters to fully return where the accident happened, the state fishing agency said at the meeting.The state environmental watchdog plans to finish its assessment of the damage by July 1, its head told Putin. Vladimir Chuprov, a Greenpeace activist, said the damage to the water totalled 100 billion roubles ($1.44 billion), a figure that was higher than it should be because of what he said was the slow official response, the TASS news agency reported. The city of Norilsk is home to mining giant Norilsk Nickel. The company and emergency specialists are collecting contaminated soil and fuel from local rivers into containers.Nornickel has already spent 5 billion roubles on the clean-up, its co-owner Vladimir Potanin said. The mining giant also plans to spend 13.5 billion roubles on safety checks for its remaining fuel storage tanks in 2020-2021.More than 90% of the fuel from the rivers and about 70% of the contaminated soil have been already collected, Nornickel said earlier this week.Putin previously ordered officials to check all similar fuel storages in Russia, and they plan to complete this process by July 24, they told him.

19-06-2020||World||WHO should change rules that led it to oppose travel restrictions, ex-chief says||The World Health Organization should change guidelines that led it to oppose travel restrictions early in the coronavirus epidemic, said former WHO chief Gro Harlem Brundtland, who now chairs an independent watchdog that monitors the global body.The WHO’s decision to oppose travel restrictions when it declared an international emergency on Jan. 30 has been one of the steps criticised by the United States, which has announced it will quit the UN agency.Brundtland, speaking to a briefing on Friday, strongly opposed the U.S. decision to quit the WHO. But she acknowledged a need to look at the guidelines, known as the International Health Regulations, agreed by member states years earlier and which discourage restricting trade and travel during epidemics.The guidelines “need reform and we will propose reforms because we have seen weaknesses very clearly,” Brundtland said. “In the whole process of formulating and agreeing on the International Health Regulations, many countries were adamant to try to avoid air and travel restrictions.”She said some governments had worried that the threat of travel restrictions would cause countries not to report outbreaks.Brundtland, a former Norwegian prime minister who led the WHO from 1998-2003, said China’s delay last year in reporting the new coronavirus had led to more cases, but that Beijing’s response was far better than during the 2003 SARS outbreak.“I think it’s right to say that China had maybe learned something from the SARS experience where they really closed down and refused to speak to the WHO and even to me as director-general when I had to enter in,” Brundtland said.“This time, China did communicate with WHO, although I do believe that it took too many days, maybe a week or two more than it should (have), to really give the information that they already had,” she said.President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will quit the WHO and withhold funding for the body, which Trump says was too supportive of China early in the crisis.Brundtland said quitting the WHO was “the most astonishingly and transparently counterproductive” of all of Trump’s moves against multilateral arrangements. “I believe the WHO is essential,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-should-change-rules-that-led-it-to-oppose-travel-restrictions-ex-chief-says/story-sOlqOxYlAHRQjGOm22Hh5I.html
19-06-2020||World||More Covid-19 positive Indians in UK likely to die due to diabetes: Study||A major new study released on Friday says that people of Indian and other south Asian origin are more likely to die after contracting coronavirus due at least in part to a higher prevalence of pre-existing diabetes than others with similar disease conditions. The study by experts at the University of Edinburgh of nearly 35,000 patients in 260 UK hospitals says that Indians and other sections categorised as ethnic minorities are more likely to be admitted to critical care and receive invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) than Whites.Ewen Harrison, study lead and professor of surgery and data science at the university, said: “These findings once again put ethnicity at front and centre in determining the effects of Covid-19. It is tragic to see any group in society to be at increased risk compared to others”. “Diabetes is more common in South Asian people and this is likely to explain some of these findings, further research is needed to understand this association and the underlying reasons for this increased risk”.“There are important implications for policy - South Asian people are more likely to be in public facing jobs particularly in health and social care. Policy makers should account for ethnicity when developing future guidelines around Covid-19,” he added.The findings released before publication in a journal add to recent reports by Public Health England and other bodies that highlight the disproportionate impact of the virus on the ethnic minority population in the UK; the reasons include pre-existing economic inequalities.The study researchers recruited hospitalised patients with suspected/confirmed Covid-19 from 260 hospitals across England, Scotland and Wales, collecting data directly and from records between February 6 and May 8 with follow-up until May 22.Of 34,986 patients enrolled, Indian and other ethnic minorities were younger and more likely to have diabetes (type 1/type 2) but had fewer other co-morbidities such as chronic heart disease or dementia than the White group, the study says.No difference was seen between ethnic groups in the time from symptom onset to hospital admission, nor in illness severity at admission. Critical care admission was more common in South Asian, Black, and other ethnic minority groups compared to the White group, after adjusting for age, sex and location.The study says: “This was broadly unchanged after adjustment for deprivation and co-morbidities. Patterns were similar for IMV. Higher adjusted mortality was seen in the South Asian, but not East Asian, Black or other ethnic minority groups, compared to the White group.“18% of the excess mortality in South Asians was mediated by pre-existing diabetes”, it adds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-covid-19-positive-indians-in-uk-likely-to-die-due-to-diabetes-study/story-gO6jSJHoiT50416GByu3rL.html
19-06-2020||World||Beijing Covid-19 strain could have come from Europe, says Chinese expert||The coronavirus strain that triggered the ongoing outbreak in Beijing could have originated in Europe, local officials said Friday after Chinese scientists released the genome sequence of samples picked up from the Xinfadi market linked to nearly all the cases.Preliminary genetic sequencing research shows that this virus came from Europe , Zhang Yong, an assistant director at China’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), was quoted as saying, adding that strain is older than the viruses currently circulating in Europe.Gao Fu, the CDC director, had earlier said the virus could have started spreading in Beijing as early as the start of May.The genome sequencing, put out late Thursday, had been shared with the WHO and the Global Influenza Data Initiative (GISAID), the CDC said.The first cluster of new coronavirus infections was traced to the Huanan seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the first epidentre of the pandemic, in December.It has since infected almost 8.5 million people globally.Earlier in the day, the national health commission (NHC) said Beijing had added 25 new cases of Covid-19 for June 18, four more than the day before, taking the total number to 183 for the new outbreak in the city with nearly all the infections linked to the sprawling Xinfadi fresh food market in the southwestern Fengtai district.“The large amounts of samples found in the Xinfadi wholesale market indicate that the virus has been around for some time. If it had only just arrived in the city for a short period of time, there may not have been so many positive samples found; however, we need more data before making an informed decision about its origin,” the CDC official Zhang said.The first case in this new outbreak was reported on June 11, leading city authorities to reimpose a level two alert days after it had been lowered to the level three, or the least, alert on June 6.Beijing authorities acted quickly to curb infection risks in the capital, shutting down and disinfecting fresh food and wet markets, fencing off dozens of residential communities near the affected markets, restricting travel out of Beijing and carrying out hundreds of thousands of nucleic acid tests.Beijing is under a restricted lockdown with three categories of people not allowed to leave.The first category includes confirmed Covid-19 patients, suspected cases, close contacts, asymptomatic carriers and people with fever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-covid-19-strain-could-have-come-from-europe-says-chinese-expert/story-UuLcpKhu4JILG12PBnBAgN.html

The government’s plan is working. Infection rates are rapidly falling, we have protected the NHS and, thanks to the hard work of millions in our health and social care services, we are getting the country back on her feet.”The update says: “The Joint Biosecurity Centre has recommended that the Covid-19 alert level should move from Level 4 (A Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation; transmission is high or rising exponentially) to Level 3 (A Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation)”.“There has been a steady decrease in cases we have seen in all four nations, and this continues. It does not mean that the pandemic is over. The virus is still in general circulation, and localised outbreaks are likely to occur”.“We have made progress against the virus thanks to the efforts of the public and we need the public to continue to follow the guidelines carefully to ensure this progress continues”, the update adds.As of June 18, the cumulative figure for deaths in the UK was 42,288 and 300,469 cases.The UK’s five Covid-19 alert levels are:Level 1 Covid-19 is not known to be present in the UK.Level 2 Covid-19 is present in the UK, but the number of cases and transmission is low.Level 3 A Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation.Level 4 A Covid-19 epidemic is in general circulation; transmission is high or rising exponentially.Level 5 As level 4 and there is a material risk of healthcare services being overwhelmed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-big-moment-after-dwindling-cases-uk-lowers-alert-level-to-3/story-VmElrHC40MME89d0p2hgbM.html
19-06-2020||World||Donald Trump shrugs off backlash, Covid-19 fears ahead of mass campaign rally||Donald Trump’s decision to pack thousands of people into an arena for his first campaign rally in three months, intended to reinvigorate both his re-election effort and the candidate himself, has instead kept the president on the defensive.The Tulsa, Oklahoma, rally set for Saturday was supposed to signal that America is well on its way back to normal after weathering both the coronavirus outbreak and nationwide protests against police brutality. And the event was just as much about lifting the president’s own morale, following broad criticism of his response to the virus crisis and the unrest, according to officials familiar with the campaign.But instead, the rally has led to new scrutiny of the president’s handling of both the pandemic and the nation’s divisive racial inequities. Health officials in Oklahoma have recommended delaying the event, expected to draw at least 100,000 people to the state’s second-largest city, as cases of Covid-19 rise.Trump already moved the rally back a day after initially scheduling it for Juneteenth, a commemoration of the end of slavery, drawing criticism that he was insensitive to the plight of African Americans. Moreover, Tulsa is the site of one of the worst incidents of racial violence in American history, the 1921 sacking of a prosperous Black neighborhood named Greenwood by a White mob.Rallies were the centerpiece of Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign and continued through his presidency, providing a platform to reach voters directly, and a trove of voter data. Trump began increasing their frequency late last year -- until the coronavirus forced the campaign to suspend them in March.Undercutting MessageThe virus has damaged Trump’s campaign in another way -- undercutting his message that he should be re-elected because of a booming economy. Social-distancing measures and stay-at-home orders led to the loss of millions of jobs and sent the economy into a tailspin.Polls show Trump trailing Democrat Joe Biden nationally and in key swing states as voters express concern over the president’s handling of the virus and national protests that erupted over instances of police brutality and racism.Yet Trump maintains an advantage over Biden: enthusiasm among his core supporters, reflected in polls and turnout at campaign events. The rallies highlight that difference, people close to the president said.“There’s just a hunger for the rallies. And I enjoy doing them,” Trump said in an interview with Fox News on Wednesday. “It gives energy to everybody. And we have tremendous enthusiasm.”Economic AchievementsTrump’s speech on Saturday will likely highlight the economic achievements of his administration before the pandemic struck.The president will also argue that the best prescription to unite a country amid the nationwide protests and civil unrest is an economic one, according to administration officials.The demonstrations were sparked by outrage over George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who died in the custody of a Minneapolis police officer who knelt into his neck for more than eight minutes.Trump has rejected the idea of systemic racism among police, along with calls by protesters to overhaul law enforcement and cut police funding. Instead, he is backing new training programs as well as economic development and school choice.His campaign is sending more than 50 of its surrogates to the rally, including a large contingent representing the campaign’s outreach initiative called “Black Voices for Trump.”But Oklahoma is a securely red state and its Black population is just 7.8%, below the national average.Paris Dennard, a senior communications adviser at the Republican National Committee, defended Trump’s initial decision to hold the rally on Juneteenth. He said the media took a “negative” view of the choice, but that he and other Black campaign and White House officials officials were supportive.Dennard said they saw the rally date as an opportunity for Trump to highlight both the holiday and “Black Wall Street,” another name for Tulsa’s Greenwood District, which was a beacon of Black wealth before it was wiped out by White mobs.President’s ‘Vision’The economic element “fits into the president’s vision for” Black Americans, Dennard said. “When it was decided” that the rally would be held on June 19, “we said ‘Well, we can make this work.’”Trump has said he’s eager to resume the rallies. In remarks alongside Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt at a White House event about reopening small businesses on Thursday, Trump boasted of the audience he’s likely to draw.“We’re going to be in Oklahoma and its a crowd like I guess nobody has seen before,” Trump said. “We have tremendous requests for tickets, like I think, probably politically has never happened before.”Biden has largely been confined to his home in Delaware and has not held many public campaign events because of the pandemic. A June 8 CNN poll showed that Trump’s supporters are more enthusiastic to vote for him in November than those who plan to vote for Biden.Trailing BidenTrump trails Biden by an average of 8.5 percentage points, nationally, according to the average of polls compiled by RealClear Politics.The campaign said more than 1 million tickets have been requested and has tweeted pictures of people who started lining up for the event earlier this week.The rally will be held the BOK Center, an indoor arena that has capacity of about 20,000 people. Local officials expect an overflow crowd of perhaps 80,000 more people, including 35,000 in a nearby convention center and thousands in the streets.The event is moving forward despite concern raised by epidemiologists and local health officials that there’s been a spike in cases in Tulsa and that indoor events are ideal for transmitting the coronavirus. The state has recommended attendees get virus tests before and after the rally.Downplaying Safety ConcernsBut campaign officials downplayed safety concerns, saying they’ll conduct temperature checks, and offer masks and hand sanitizer to those attending as a precaution against spreading the virus. But masks won’t be required.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany in a briefing this week, defended Trump’s move to hold a rally during the pandemic, comparing it to the Floyd protests. McEnany complained of a double standard, criticism of Trump for holding the rally but not of the protests with people marching shoulder-to-shoulder in the streets.A spokeswoman for the BOK Center, Meghan Blood, said in a statement that it had asked the campaign for a plan “detailing the steps the event will institute for health and safety, including those related to social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-shrugs-off-backlash-covid-19-fears-ahead-of-mass-campaign-rally/story-RUXrUyyvZ5glViPM9nEfVN.html
19-06-2020||World||Covid-19 was circulating in Italy in December 2019, says study||Scientists in Italy have found traces of the new coronavirus in wastewater collected from Milan and Turin in December 2019 - suggesting Covid-19 was already circulating in Northern Italy before China reported the first cases.The Italian National Institute of Health looked at 40 sewage samples collected from wastewater treatment plants in northern Italy between October 2019 and February 2020. An analysis released late on Thursday said samples taken in Milan and Turin on December 18 showed the presence of the SARS-Cov-2 virus.“This research may help us understand the beginning of virus circulation in Italy,” Giuseppina La Rosa, an expert in environmental wastewater at the Italian National Institute of Health who co-led the research, said in a statement detailing the findings.Small studies conducted by scientific teams in the Netherlands, France, Australia and elsewhere have found signs that the virus that causes Covid-19 can be detected in sewage, and many countries are beginning to use wastewater sampling to track the spread of the disease.La Rosa said the detection of traces of the virus before the end of 2019 was consistent with evidence emerging in other countries that Covid-19 may have been circulating before China reported the first cases of a new disease on December 31.A study in May by French scientists found that a man was infected with Covid-19 as early as December 27, nearly a month before France confirmed its first cases.La Rosa said the presence of the virus in the Italian waste samples did not “automatically imply that the main transmission chains that led to the development of the epidemic in our country originated from these very first cases”.Samples positive for traces of the virus that causes Covid-19 were also found in sewage from Bologna, Milan and Turin in January and February 2020. Samples taken in October and November 2019 tested negative.The institute said it plans to launch a pilot study in July to monitor wastewater at sites identified in tourist resorts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-was-circulating-in-italy-in-december-2019-says-study/story-Cbq4yMsydEgthiZef9XSVN.html

There are no approved vaccines or treatments for the illness caused by the new coronavirus, but about a dozen vaccines are being trialled globally as drugmakers and governments scramble to combat the health crisis. Clover said initial safety data from the study was expected in August this year, and it would target to start broader studies by the end of this year. China now accounts for almost half of the clinical trials testing Covid-19 vaccines, including candidates from CanSino Biological, and Sinopharm and the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products.GSK, the world’s largest vaccine maker, on Friday underscored its commitment to backing a conventional immunisation approach. It has mainly acted as a contributor of adjuvants, or efficacy boosters, that are combined with proteins called antigens that help build immunity.Clover and the British drugmaker began their collaboration for a coronavirus vaccine in February this year and the Chinese firm partnered with Dynavax the following month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sixth-trial-of-potential-chinese-covid-19-shot-begins-with-gsk-dynavax-mix/story-GJq7REWODNVfQiPYu6KD7O.html
19-06-2020||World||Draft UN resolution calls for three aid crossings to Syria amid Covid outbreak||A draft UN resolution would maintain two border crossing points from Turkey to deliver humanitarian aid to Syria’s mainly rebel-held northwest and reopen an Iraqi crossing to the northeast to deliver medical supplies for the Covid-19 pandemic.Russia, which insisted the Iraqi crossing be shut in January, holds the key to future cross-border operations. It contends cross-border aid was meant to be a temporary response to the nine-year Syrian conflict and the situation on the ground has changed.The proposed Security Council resolution, drafted by Belgium and Germany and obtained Thursday by The Associated Press, emphasises that 11 million Syrians need aid and that cross-border deliveries remain “an urgent and temporary solution” to help them.It states that the pandemic presents “a profound challenge to Syria’s health system, socio-economic and humanitarian situations” and “heightens the imperative of using every possible means of reaching people in need”.In January, Russia scored a victory for its close ally Syria, using its veto threat to force the Security Council to adopt a resolution reducing the number of crossing points for aid deliveries from four to just two, from Turkey to the northwest. It also cut in half the year-long mandate that had been in place since cross-border deliveries began in 2014 to six months, as Russia insisted.The newly circulated draft resolution would extend the mandate for the two border crossings from Turkey to the northwest - Bab al-Salam and Bab al-Hawa - for a year. And it would reopen the Al Yarubiyah crossing from Iraq for an initial period of six months until January 10, 2021, and for an additional six-month period if the council decides the impact of the pandemic warrants it after evaluating a report to be done by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.Last month, UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock called the northwest border operation “a lifeline for millions of civilians whom the UN cannot reach by other means”, saying deliveries are at record levels with 1,365 trucks crossing from Turkey in April.Al Yarubiyah had been used mainly to deliver medical supplies to the northeast and while a first road delivery from Syria made it to the region in May, UN officials say the crossing from Iraq is essential to bring in Covid-19 supplies.Human Rights Watch’s UN Director Louis Charbonneau said its research in late April showed that restrictions on aid from Damasus and Iraq were preventing medical supplies and personnel from reaching two million people in the northeast, where there were dozens of confirmed Covid-19 cases in May and at least three deaths.“The UN Security Council - including Russia - needs to act quickly to reauthorise medical aid deliveries from Iran to Syria’s northeast to prevent further spread of Covid-19 that could devastate the region,” Charbonneau said, stressing that alternatives to Al Yarubiyah proposed by Russia and others “have failed to close the gap”.Whether Russia will allow the Al Yarubiyah reopening remains to be seen. The current mandate for the two Turkish crossings ends on July 10, and the Security Council hasn’t yet engaged in serious discussions on the Belgian-German draft resolution.Last month, Russia’s UN Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said in response to Lowcock and calls by US Ambassador Kelly Craft for the Iraq crossing to be opened: “Do not waste your time on efforts to reopen the closed cross-border points.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/draft-un-resolution-calls-for-three-aid-crossings-to-syria-amid-covid-outbreak/story-Qi0JE0uINHbtRR8WV3V6VL.html

Some Democrats took issue with her record on police misconduct and other prosecutions.Klobuchar, who competed against Biden for the party’s presidential nomination before endorsing him, said she spoke with Biden on Wednesday night.Biden late on Thursday praised Klobuchar’s “grit and determination” on Twitter and said that “with your help, we’re going to beat Donald Trump.”Biden has already promised to pick a woman as his running mate, and several black candidates are on his short list, including Senator Kamala Harris and Representative Val Demings.

It prevents deportation of people who arrived in the United States of America as minors.It was rescinded by President Trump in September but gave the Congress time to come out with a policy in six months to decide on the fate of nearly 7,00,000 individuals, many of whom are Indian or South Asian descent.However, a report in American publication The Hill said that the court’s decision does not prevent the Trump administration from working to rescind the DACA programme in the future, meaning the fate of the deportation reprieve could be decided by voters in the November general election.What happens next?The ruling, authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, sent the issue back to the US Department of Homeland Security for further consideration, concluding that the administration did not provide sufficient reasoning to end DACA.The decision deemed the Trump administration’s actions in seeking to rescind DACA “arbitrary and capricious” in violation of a federal law that governs regulatory changes.A senior Department of Homeland Security official said the agency was reviewing the ruling.What about new applicants?The US Supreme Court ruling means that the roughly 6,49,000 immigrants, now enrolled in DACA will remain protected from deportation and eligible to obtain renewable two-year work permits. Lower courts had blocked Trump’s 2017 action so the programme remained in effect, though the administration refused to process new applications.California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, whose state was among the challengers that sued to try to preserve DACA, said the ruling could reopen the programme “to anyone who qualifies,” but that legal processes in lower courts were still ongoing that could determine whether new applications must be processed by the government.Trump promised as a candidate in 2016 to end DACA, which he called one of Obama’s “illegal executive amnesties,” and has pursued hardline immigration policies but could face election risks if he again tries to rescind it.Meanwhile, the South Asian groups in the US have welcomed the Supreme Court’s decision. “Although it is conditional, today’s victory is welcome at a time when the war on Black communities feels endless,” said Lakshmi Sridaran, executive director of South Asian Americans Leading Together or SAALT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-us-supreme-court-s-blow-to-trump-on-daca-what-next-for-immigrants/story-MuhEsG6kxBcTH7MHPpJa4M.html

19-06-2020||World||Pink eye may be primary symptom of Covid-19: Study||While coughing, fever and difficulty in breathing are common symptoms of Covid-19, a new case study has found that pink eye is also a reason to be tested for the disease. The study, published in the Canadian Journal of Ophthalmology, determined that conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctivitis can also be primary symptoms of Covid-19. The researchers noted that in March, a 29-year-old woman arrived at the Royal Alexandra Hospital’s Eye Institute of Alberta with a severe case of conjunctivitis and minimal respiratory symptoms. After the patient had undergone several days of treatment with little improvement -- and after it had been determined that the woman had recently returned home from Asia -- a resident ordered a Covid-19 test. The test came back positive, according to the researchers. “What is interesting in this case, and perhaps very different to how it had been recognised at that specific time, was that the main presentation of the illness was not a respiratory symptom. It was the eye,” said Carlos Solarte, an assistant professor at the University of Alberta in Canada. “There was no fever and no cough, so we weren’t led to suspect Covid-19 at the beginning. We didn’t know it could present primarily with the eye and not with the lungs,” Solarte said. Academic studies at the outset of the pandemic identified conjunctivitis as a secondary symptoms in about 10 to 15 per cent of Covid-19 cases, he said. Since then, scientists have gained greater knowledge of how the virus can transmit through and affect the body’s mucous membrane system, of which the conjunctiva -- the clear, thin membrane that covers the front surface of the eye -- is an extension. While the finding provides important new health information for the public, it also makes eye exams more complicated for ophthalmologists and staff, the researchers noted. “The patient in this case eventually recovered well without any issues. But several of the residents and staff who were in close contact with the patient had to be under quarantine,” said Solarte. “Fortunately, none who were involved in her care also tested positive,” he said. Patients coming into an eye clinic with conjunctivitis and keratoconjunctivitis are now treated as potential cases of Covid-19 and extra precautions are taken by staff, according to the researchers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pink-eye-may-be-primary-symptom-of-covid-19-study/story-RSHxmnCNbKuBegrF233H5L.html

The Hong Kong Journalists Association said a survey of members revealed 98% disagreed with the laws.Reporters Without Borders -- known by its French acronym RSF -- had previously said the new laws “will make it easier for the authoritarian Chinese regime to trample on rights, including press freedom, that are supposed to be guaranteed in the former British colony under the ‘one country, two systems’ principle until 2047.”Press FreedomThe more specific concerns about the potential threats to journalists also come amid longer-standing concerns about the ability of media workers to operate freely in Hong Kong, which is the regional base for many international news organizations.Chief Executive Carrie Lam in April backed a city agency’s criticism of public broadcaster Radio Television Hong Kong for questioning Taiwan’s exclusion from world health bodies, a move that followed an earlier critique by pro-Beijing groups of one of the network’s political satire shows.A month earlier, as part of broader tit-for-tat retaliation between the US and China, Beijing kicked out a group of American correspondents based in the Chinese capital and specified that none of them would be able to take up work in Hong Kong -- which is supposed to have a separate immigration system.The move prompted Hong Kong’s Foreign Correspondents’ Club to question whether the city still had control of its immigration policy, saying in a statement that any change would mark “a serious erosion” of the “one country, two systems” principle by which China governs the city.Two years ago, Hong Kong denied a visa renewal for Financial Times journalist Victor Mallet after he hosted an event at the club featuring the founder of a banned pro-independence party.RSF on Friday detailed how China uses existing laws barring terrorism, secession, subversion and foreign interference to go after journalists.With no details on the news laws yet available, the group said local journalists in Hong Kong could conceivably be accused of terrorism for reporting from the scene of a violent protest, of secession for writing about Hong Kong’s independence movement or of subversion for running an anti-government opinion piece.Foreign correspondents or employees of foreign outlets, meanwhile, could also be accused of interference by foreign powers, the group said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-security-law-threatens-hong-kong-journalists-says-media-watchdog/story-Uq1WRpvE5hDZr5ceOuKXGJ.html
19-06-2020||World||Palestinians fear displacement from an annexed Jordan Valley||For generations, the people of Fasayil herded animals on the desert bluffs and palm-shaded lowlands of the Jordan Valley. Today, nearly every man in the Palestinian village works for Jewish settlers in the sprawling modern farms to the north and south.The grazing lands to the west and east, leading down to the banks of the biblical Jordan River, have been swallowed up by the settlements or fenced off by the Israeli military. So instead of leading sheep out to pasture, the men rise before dawn to work in the settlements for around $3 an hour — or they move away.“Everyone here works in the settlements, there’s nothing else,” said Iyad Taamra, a member of the village council who runs a small grocery store. “If you have some money you go somewhere else where there is a future.”Palestinians fear communities across the Jordan Valley will meet a similar fate if Israel proceeds with its plans to annex the territory, which accounts for around a quarter of the occupied West Bank and was once seen as the breadbasket of a future Palestinian state.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has vowed to annex the valley and all of Israel’s far-flung West Bank settlements, in line with President Donald Trump’s Middle East plan, which overwhelmingly favours Israel and has been rejected by the Palestinians. The process could begin as soon as July 1.Netanyahu has said Israel will annex the land but not the people who rely on it, telling an Israeli newspaper they will remain in an “enclave” under limited self-rule, with Israel maintaining security control.Few if any Palestinians would be given citizenship, leaving their legal status uncertain. In a region that heavily relies on agriculture, the loss of farm and grazing land could force many to relocate.Shaul Arieli, a retired Israeli military commander who worked on border demarcation during the peace process in the 1990s, estimates that the Palestinians would lose up to 70,000 acres (280 square kilometers) of private land. He expects Israel will carve out a new 200-kilometer (124-mile) border between the Jordan Valley and the rest of the West Bank, and a 60-kilometer (37-mile) border around the Palestinian city of Jericho.He based his conclusions on maps presented by Netanyahu and the White House, which show Israel extending sovereignty over large swaths of land while leaving most populated areas outside its borders.Itay Epshtain, a special adviser to the Norwegian Refugee Council, said Palestinians would lose some of the limited protections they have, once Israeli courts are no longer formally obliged to consider international laws related to military occupation.“Palestinians void of civil status in Israel, and not coming under the authority of the military commander, would neither have standing in the High Court nor the ability to challenge decisions of the government,” he said.The Jordan Valley is home to around 60,000 Palestinians, according to the UN, but nearly 90% of the land is part of what is known as Area C, the three-fifths of the West Bank that is under complete Israeli control. In the Jordan Valley, it includes closed military areas and around 50 agricultural settlements housing some 12,000 Israelis.Palestinians are barred from those areas, and even on the lands they own, they are forbidden from digging wells or building any kind of infrastructure without hard-to-get military permits. From 2009 until 2016, less than 2% of more than 3,300 permit applications in Area C were successful, according to Peace Now, an Israeli anti-settlement group, citing official statistics.Anything built without a permit, from home extensions to tents, animal pens and irrigation networks, is at risk of demolition by the Israeli military.“If you dig a well they will come the next day and fill it with concrete,” said Hani Saida, a farmer from the town of al-Auja. “They may annex this area, but they will never give us equal rights. They’ll keep trying to drive us away.”COGAT, the Israeli military body that oversees civilian affairs in the West Bank, declined to comment.Abdul-Malik al-Jaber, a Canadian-Palestinian businessman and the chairman of a large company that exports dates from the Jordan Valley, says the process of obtaining permits is a “nightmare,” even for big investors.“There’s no way on earth a normal, simple farmer can afford the cost and the complications,” he said.Al-Jaber said his company has spent the last two months and around $35,000 trying to secure a permit to build a modern date-packing plant on land he owns. He was told the Israeli military considers it a training area, even though farmers live there and work the land.He fears annexation will only make things more difficult, by cutting off workers from the company’s fields and factories and further complicating the export process.Israel’s annexation plans have sparked an international outcry, with European and Arab countries warning that it would violate international law and threaten any remaining hopes for a two-state solution.But in the Jordan Valley and elsewhere in the West Bank the response has been more muted.“From 1967 until today, water for drinking, water for agriculture, the border, the crossings, the roads, the government lands in Area C between the villages and the cities, the entrances to the towns — all of them are under Israeli control,” said Mohannad Saida, a cousin of Hani.“Nothing is going to change,” he said.He said his family owns around 750 acres (3 square kilometers) north of al-Auja, stretching to the banks of the Jordan River. They fled during the 1967 war, when Israel seized the West Bank from Jordan and their land was sealed off as a military zone.Over the years, they would drive into the hills to look down over the land. About 15 years ago, they noticed rows of freshly planted date trees, an extension of a nearby settlement.A few years later, a relative who worked as a bulldozer driver was able to enter the area for an Israeli construction project. He took pictures of the mud-brick homes where their ancestors had been born and raised.“We saw our mud houses,” Saida said. “They are still standing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-fear-displacement-from-an-annexed-jordan-valley/story-LzZTHhGPno1UZXSAANZ0PL.html

We lost a lot of things with this virus, including empathy,” said journalist Maria Trigo, from the newspaper El Deber de Santa Cruz, in a Twitter message.Fabiola Chambi, a journalist with the Cochabamba daily Los Tiempos said broadcasting the death showed “a lack of respect and humanity.”The government has yet to comment on the controversy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outrage-after-bolivian-tv-broadcasts-covid-19-death/story-VQewOBvjBwUI3nKWjjCA7H.html

19-06-2020||World||No going back to lockdown in US, world will have Covid-19 vaccine soon: Fauci||The United States does not need more widespread lockdowns to bring its Covid-19 outbreak under control, despite the fact that the national daily infection rate has stayed flat, leading government expert Anthony Fauci said Thursday.Speaking to AFP, the physician-scientist added he was optimistic the world would soon have a vaccine that would end the pandemic, calling early trial results “encouraging.”“I don’t think we’re going to be talking about going back to lockdown,” he said when asked whether places like California and Texas that are seeing a surge in their caseload should reissue stay-at-home orders.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here“I think we’re going to be talking about trying to better control those areas of the country that seem to be having a surge of cases.”The US leads the world in the number of confirmed infections and in deaths, with the fatality toll approaching 120,000.But while former epicenters New York and New Jersey have controlled their outbreaks, the virus is now increasing in 20 states -- creating a plateau in the national case graph. Fauci stressed a localized approach as the country returns to normal -- including on the crucial question of when to reopen schools. “Counties where there are certainly no cases at all, there’s no problem with the schools opening,” he said.“There are other parts where there’s a modest amount of infection (where) you may delay school openings.”For those regions in between, “you want to make some modification of the process, namely: alternate days, morning versus afternoon, seating people apart from each other wearing masks.”Click here for complete coronavirus coverage On the question of re-opening the country’s borders, he struck a cautious note. “Obviously, there is an interest in getting back to some form of normality in our interactions with other countries,” he said, adding the topic was reviewed almost daily but refusing to give a timeline.The 79-year-old has led the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984, and has overseen the nation’s response to every epidemic from HIV onward.A growing issue however has been a loss of public faith in science, especially during the current crisis.“Even when the recommendations are to wear a mask, a recommendation that I’ve been involved in making, there are some groups that actually do the recommendations very strictly,” said Fauci.“And then... you see pictures of people in bars and in congregations without that. So again, it’s a mixed bag.”- ‘Nature’s proof of concept’ -Many within the scientific community have described the development of a vaccine for the SARS-CoV-2 virus as a “Moonshot” given there has never been a successful vaccine for any human coronavirus.Then there is the fact that scientists have failed to develop a vaccine for HIV, despite trying for decades. Fauci stressed that the two weren’t comparable.“The reason I have more confidence with coronavirus is that we know the majority of people recover from COVID-19 because their immune system clears the virus,” he said.“So nature has already given you a proof of concept that it can be done.”Since people who recover produce virus-fighting antibodies, scientists are confident that these antibodies can also be elicited by a man-made antigen.Fauci added he was “cautiously optimistic” about the National Institutes of Health’s early animal studies on the Moderna vaccine, as well as early results from the human study which produced “encouraging” neutralizing antibodies.But he added that just because the Moderna vaccine and another produced by Oxford University appeared to be “temporally ahead,” it did not mean their final results would be the best.On the treatment front, Fauci said he was “very impressed” with results from a British trial into the steroid dexamethasone, which was found to reduce deaths among Covid-19 patients on ventilators by a third.However, given it works by suppressing the abnormal immune response that damages the body’s organs, rather than attacking the virus, Fauci cautioned it should not be prescribed too soon after a person was infected.“It had no effect, if not maybe even a suggestion of making things worse early on,” he said.“This is perfectly compatible with knowing that early on in infection, you need the immune system to suppress the virus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-going-back-to-lockdown-in-us-world-will-have-covid-19-vaccine-soon-fauci/story-vnCZisedy2bK6rgQZrgXaO.html

However, the funding is not,” he said. “With this funding level, the WFP common services will come to a standstill by the third week of July.” Daoudi said WFP has eight Covid-19 response hubs around the world connected by a global network of air and sea transport that so far have dispatched 15,000 cubic meters (about 530,000 cubic feet) of critical items to tackle the coronavirus to 132 countries on behalf of health and humanitarian organizations.He said, for example, that one cubic meter (about 35 cubic feet) contains “around 32,500 surgical masks, 1,650 safety goggles, 1,800 face shields and/or 30,000 examination gloves.” Daoudi said 70,000 cubic meters (about 2.47 million cubic feet) of cargo are in the pipeline to be transported over the next six weeks on behalf of more than 30 organizations. To do that, he said, between 120 and 130 large 747 cargo planes are needed, because each can only carry 650 cubic meters (about 23,000 cubic feet).“And this is only the tip of the iceberg,” he said. “Moving beyond the next six weeks the demand is quite huge and we are talking about delivering to over 132 different countries across the globe, so the urgency is there, the needs are there.” D aoudi said “projections indicate that approximately upwards of 700,000 cubic meters (almost 25 million cubic feet) of cargo will need to be delivered across the world by the end of the year.” But he said that will be impossible unless WFP receives $820 million to continue its Covid-19 logistics service through 2020.Daoudi welcomed “generous donations of air transport capacity” from the United Arab Emirates and the European Union as part of its air bridge, and said WFP is in discussions with NATO, the United Kingdom and other countries about offering air assets. WFP’s two strategic hubs for Covid-19 deliveries are in Guangzhou, China and Liège, Belgium, along with six regional hubs in Dubai, United Arab Emirates; Addis Ababa, Ethiopia; Accra, Ghana; Johannesburg, South Africa; Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia and Panama, he said.Daoudi said WFP has been providing passenger transport services for health and humanitarian workers where safe and reliable commercial options are not available.“WFP is working to open more passenger routes in Latin America and add destinations throughout Africa, Asia and the Middle East,” he said. “The moment there are commercial viable options WFP will stand down its services.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-seeks-urgent-funding-for-pandemic-aid-transport/story-LTbac6x92ov2ND0ZUrwb2J.html

19-06-2020||World||One-fifth of Belt and Road projects ‘seriously affected’ by Covid-19 pandemic: China||About 20% of projects under China’s ambitious Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to link Asia, Europe and beyond have been “seriously affected” by the coronavirus pandemic, an official from China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on Friday. According to a survey by the ministry, about 40% of projects have seen little adverse impact, and another 30-40% have been somewhat affected, said Wang Xiaolong, director-general of the ministry’s International Economic Affairs Department, at a news briefing in Beijing.“About 20% percent of the projects have been seriously affected,” he said. Wang did not give any details.The results from the survey were better than expected and although some projects had been put on hold, China had not heard of any major projects being cancelled, he added.Over 100 countries have signed agreements with China to cooperate in BRI projects like railways, ports, highways and other infrastructure. According to a Refinitiv database, over 2,600 projects at a cost of $3.7 trillion are linked to the initiative.Restrictions on travel and the flow of goods across borders, as well as local measures to combat Covid-19, were the main reasons for the impacts on projects, said Wang. “As the situation improves we have confidence that the projects will come back and the execution of them will speed up,” he said.The challenge of the pandemic to BRI projects follows a pushback in 2018, when officials in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka and elsewhere criticized projects there as costly and unnecessary.China scaled back some plans after several countries sought to review, cancel or scale down commitments, citing concerns over costs, erosion of sovereignty, and corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-fifth-of-belt-and-road-projects-seriously-affected-by-covid-19-pandemic-china/story-XvmSgYmh2eXy3wYT6GLOAK.html
19-06-2020||World||Putin insists on recognition of USSR’s WWII role||In a lengthy article in a US journal, Russian President Vladimir Putin insists on recognition of the Soviet Union as the prime defeater of Nazi Germany, criticizes Poland’s actions before the war and defends the annexation of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia.The article, titled “The Real Lessons of the 75th Anniversary of World War II,” appeared in the National Interest journal on Thursday, six days before a huge military parade in Red Square to commemorate the end of World War II in Europe.The timing underlines how the war, in which the Soviet Union lost an estimated 27 million people, is a linchpin of Russia’s national identity and how officials bristle at any questioning of the USSR’s role.“It is essential to pass on to future generations the memory of the fact that the Nazis were defeated first and foremost by the Soviet people,” Putin wrote. He bemoaned that “certain politicians rushed to claim that Russia was trying to rewrite history.” Poland and Russia frequently butt heads over who is to blame for starting the war, and Putin took up the issue in the article.“The blame for the tragedy that Poland then suffered lies entirely with the Polish leadership, which had impeded the formation of a military alliance between Britain, France and the Soviet Union and relied on the help from its Western partners, throwing its own people under the steamroller of Hitler’s machine of destruction,” Putin wrote.Putin reiterated the contention that the Soviet Union was forced into signing a non-aggression agreement with Germany before the war — the so-called Molotov-Ribbentrop pact — after Western powers cold-shouldered creating a military alliance.“The Soviet Union did its utmost to use every chance of creating an anti-Hitler coalition. Despite — I will say it again — the double dealing on the part of the Western countries,” he wrote.He also defended the wartime annexation of the Baltic nations.“Their accession to the USSR was implemented on a contractual basis, with the consent of the elected authorities. This was in line with international and state law of that time,” he said. “The Baltic republics within the USSR preserved their government bodies, language, and had representation in the higher state structures of the Soviet Union.” “I believe that it is unacceptable to equate liberators with occupiers,” he said.He concluded by suggesting that a prime lesson of the war is the necessity of broad international diplomacy. He expressed hope that a Russia-proposed summit of the leaders of the U.N. Security Council’s veto-holding countries would take place soon to discuss global security, the economic consequences of the coronavirus pandemic and other issues.“There can be no doubt that the summit of Russia, China, France, the United States and the UK can play an important role in finding common answers to modern challenges,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-insists-on-recognition-of-ussr-s-wwii-role/story-5afWXkT5L4SIqlPQO0A2IJ.html
19-06-2020||World||Canada to introduce Covid-19 tracing app in July||Canada is introducing a contact tracing smartphone app that will notify Canadians of exposure to the new coronavirus.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Thursday the app will be voluntary and that if someone tests positive, other users who have the app and have been in proximity will then be alerted they’ve been exposed to someone who has tested positive. Trudeau said privacy will be respected.“At no time will personal information be collected or shared, and no location services will be used,” Trudeau said.Governments around the world have been turning to smartphone technology to help battle fresh virus flare-ups as they ease lockdown restrictions. But technical problems and privacy concerns have dogged the development of virus tracing apps.Health authorities in Britain announced Thursday they are scrapping plans to launch their own coronavirus contact tracing smartphone app because of technical problems and will now work on building one using technology supplied by Apple and Google.Other European nations such as Switzerland, Germany and Italy, are using a “decentralized” approach based on the Apple-Google smartphone interface, which experts say is better for privacy because it keeps data on phones.“We drew lessons from what other people did around the world,” Trudeau said. “This type of simple and anonymous application, that is entirely voluntary, will be extremely powerful in terms of helping us to reopen the economy safely.” Ontario will soon begin testing the app which is being developed with the help of Canadian technology companies Shopify and BlackBerry. He said Apple and Google recently put out major upgrades to their operating systems and that the app will be available in July.“It will be up to individual Canadians to decide whether to download the app or not but the app will be most effective when as many people as possible have it,” Trudeau said.He said there are 30 million smartphones in Canada that can take the app, and he hopes over 50 percent download it.“Any amount of people that download it will be useful for that person and for society. But it’s certain that if we can talk about 50% uptake, for example, or more, then it becomes extraordinarily useful,” he said.The prime minister said the app will encourage people to reach out to their local public health authorities.The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Canada passed the 100,000 mark on Thursday. There have been more than 8,200 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-to-introduce-covid-19-tracing-app-in-july/story-NONjsfI9kAXHOLNKmBRxpK.html
19-06-2020||World||Australian PM Scott Morrison says unnamed state increasing cyberattacks||Australia is under increasing cyberattack from a “sophisticated state-based cyber actor,” Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Friday.The PM would not name the state, and he said he made the growing threat public to raise awareness.“This activity is targeting Australian organizations across a range of sectors, including all levels of government, industry, political organizations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure,” the Australian PM said.Although the threat was constant, the frequency of attacks had increased “over many months.” “This is the actions of a state-based actor with significant capabilities. There aren’t too many state-based actors who have those capabilities,” Morrison said.Morrison said he particularly wanted organizations involved in health, critical infrastructure and essential services to bolster technical defences to thwart such malicious attacks.Defence Minister Linda Reynolds said the government’s cyber agency, Australian Cyber Security Center, and the Home Affairs Department had published on Friday a technical advisory on how organizations can detect and mitigate cyber threats.Morrison would not comment on the inevitable speculation that the cyberattacks were part of Australia’s increasingly hostile rift with China.China in recent weeks banned beef exports from Australia’s largest abattoirs, ended trade in Australian barley with a tariff wall and warned its citizens against visiting Australia.The measures are widely interpreted as punishment for Australia’s advocacy of an independent probe into the origins and spread of the coronavirus pandemic.Australia’s foreign minister this week accused China of using the anxiety around the pandemic to undermine Western democracies by spreading disinformation online, prompting China to accuse Australia of disinformation.Morrison said “Australia doesn’t engage lightly in public attribution” and would not name the country behind the current cyber campaign.“I can’t control what speculation others might engage in on this issue,” he said.Morrison said he had discussed the growing cyber security threat with Australia’s allies and had spoken overnight to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson on the subject.Australian investigations to date had not uncovered any “large-scale personal data breaches,” Morrison said.Australian cyber security authorities had “thwarted many” attacks,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-leader-says-unnamed-state-increasing-cyberattacks/story-ZsWxvORfZQFCIDm1NQiOWJ.html
19-06-2020||World||Japan lifts Covid-19 travel curbs to help economy bounce back||Japan lifted all coronavirus-related curbs on domestic travel on Friday, with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe calling on people to go sightseeing or attend concerts and other events to help the nation’s economy bounce back from a pandemic recession.Japan began lifting its pandemic lockdown in May as coronavirus infections fell. The latest easing on Thursday comes after the end of an emergency declaration that allowed people to return to work and for bars and restaurants implementing social distancing measures to reopen.“I would like people, while observing social distancing, to go out on sightseeing trips. We would like you to make an effort to engage in social and economic activity,” Abe said in an address to the country late on Thursday.The end of a government advisory for people to stay put in infected prefectures or avoid travelling to them should help hotels, resorts and areas that rely heavily on tourism. Any recovery, however, may be slow because many people are still avoiding crowds and most travel to Japan is still restricted. Only 1,700 foreigners arrived in Japan in May, the lowest number for that time of year since 1964, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization.Japan’s two big airlines, ANA Holdings and Japan Airlines Co., say they are restarting some domestic flights as demand picks up, but both say flight schedules by July will still only be half of what they had planned before the coronavirus pandemic. In addition to ending the domestic travel advisory, Japan is also allowing up to 1,000 people to gather at indoor and outdoor events. Japanese professional baseball teams will also restart games on Friday, although spectators will be locked out.Japan by Thursday had recorded 17,789 cases of the novel coronavirus with 948 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-lifts-covid-19-travel-curbs-to-help-economy-bounce-back/story-tqtgiUfZLVZFfikj58kWIO.html
19-06-2020||World||US drops planned limit for toxin that damages infant brains||The Trump administration on Thursday rejected imposing federal drinking-water limits for a chemical used in fireworks and other explosives and linked to brain damage in newborns, opting to override Obama administration findings that the neurotoxin was contaminating the drinking water of millions of Americans.The contaminant is perchlorate, a component in rocket fuel, ammunition and other explosives, including fireworks. The Associated Press found one high-profile example of that on Thursday, reviewing a 2016 US Geological Survey report that ties high levels of perchlorate contamination in the water at Mount Rushmore national memorial in South Dakota with past years of fireworks displays there.While officials stopped the fireworks shows at the Black Hills memorial a decade ago, the pyrotechnics are scheduled to resume this Independence Day holiday at the urging of President Donald Trump, who plans to attend the festivities on July 3.His administration has rolled back or eliminated scores of existing or pending public health and environmental protections, and the latest example came Thursday when Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler said the government would not move forward on setting the first mandatory federal limits for perchlorate in drinking water.The rollbacks have targeted Obama-era initiatives in particular, with the Trump administration saying the regulations are burdensome to business and are unnecessary.Wheeler said in a statement the decision to drop the introduction of federal limits for perchlorate fulfill’s Trump’s “promise to pare back burdensome ‘one-size-fits-all’ overregulation for the American people.” Perchlorate from runoff contaminates the drinking water of as many as 16 million Americans, the Obama administration said in 2011 when it announced the EPA would act to set maximum limits for perchlorate for the first time.Perchlorate can damage the development of fetuses and children and cause measurable drops in IQ in newborns, the American Academy of Pediatrics said last August in urging the “strongest possible” federal limits.Erik Olson of the Natural Resources Defense Council advocacy group said the EPA’s decision Thursday was “illegal, unscientific and unconscionable.” An earlier court-ordered consent decree, set after Olson’s group accused the EPA of slow-walking the then-planned regulation, gave the agency until this month to set a maximum limit for perchlorate. The organization said Thursday it planned a legal challenge to the EPA’s decision to drop the proposed regulation.The EPA said last year it was looking at four options, including a limit for perchlorate in drinking water far higher than those that California, Massachusetts and other states are currently adopting. Another option was dropping the proposal to regulate perchlorate entirely, based on the contention that “perchlorate does not occur in public water systems with a frequency, and at a level of public health concern.” Wheeler said federal regulation was not warranted now partly because of the steps that some states and public drinking water systems have taken to reduce perchlorate contamination.The EPA required some nationwide testing for perchlorate in drinking water only from 2001 to 2005, making it impossible to determine how severe a problem remains nationally, Olson said.But Trump’s EPA says it looked at some of the limited local testing done for perchlorate, including 15 water systems in a total of 12 states. It said the monitoring found levels of the rocket fuel chemical had declined in some of them.Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the top Democrat on the Environment and Public Works Committee, said in a statement that the EPA “abdicated its responsibility to set federal drinking water standards for a chemical long known to be unsafe, instead leaving it up to states to decide whether or not to protect people from it.” With the Mount Rushmore fireworks a few weeks away, a National Parks Service assessment has concluded there would be no environmental harm from reviving the annual fireworks display, parks service spokeswoman Alexandra Picavet said.But the agency’s written environmental assessment said workers planned to monitor any increase in perchlorate at Mount Rushmore after the fireworks. If readings change, more analysis “may be necessary to evaluate future events” at Mount Rushmore, the report concluded.The memorial serves 3 million visitors a year and year-round park personnel. Picavet said the water is not the primary water source for visitors and workers, and that treatment removes the perchlorate from Mount Rushmore’s drinking water.The 2016 US Geological Survey report called perchlorate contamination at Mount Rushmore “a major concern of park management.” It said past years’ fireworks displays were the “most probable source” of the contamination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-drops-planned-limit-for-toxin-that-damages-infant-brains/story-fZnfVhum6nyp6LLPsv79MO.html
19-06-2020||World||China’s acts on Indian border meant to take advantage of Covid distractions: US official||China opening multiple fronts like the one on India border may be because of Beijing’s assessment that the world is distracted due to Covid-19 pandemic and it may advantage of it, a top American diplomat said Thursday.Assistant Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell made the remark, adding the Trump administration is closely watching the Indo-China situation.The latest Chinese activities with India is similar to Beijing’s past activities on India border including Doklam, Stilwell told reporters during a conference call.“One explanation for (China) creating multiple fronts like this is an assessment in Beijing that the world is distracted and is focused entirely on survival right (now), recovering from the corona pandemic, which then possibly is seen as an opportunity to take advantage of the distraction,” Stillwell said. “I’m not going to offer an official US Government position on that, but there are numerous explanations out there for that (in the public domain),” he said, responding to a question on the aggressive Chinese behaviour with its neighbours, including India.“What we’re doing, we’re obviously watching the India-China border dispute very closely,” Stillwell said, during the conference call after the Hawaii meeting between Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi to exchange views on bilateral relations and coronavirus pandemic. “This activity is similar to the activity we’ve seen in the past on border disputes with the PRC (Peoples Republic of China), and again, I would point you to those – I think it was 2015 when Xi Jinping travelled to India the first time,” he said.“The PLA (People’s Liberation Army) invaded this contested area deeper and longer, with more people, than ever before historically. Whether that was a negotiating tactic or just a punch in the nose to demonstrate their superiority, I don’t know,” he said.“But then we saw the Doklam issue down near Bhutan, where we saw similar concerns. I wish I knew. Again, we don’t have a lot of visibility and we don’t have a lot of open dialogue with our Chinese counterparts, and honestly, I’d like to see more of that if we can,” Stillwell said.During the news conference, Stilwell did not confirm if the ongoing Indo-China border clash came up during the Pompeo-Yang talks. But the State Department official did express concern over the recent Chinese behaviour in the region.“The actions that we’ve seen out of the PRC of late -- and you all know this as you watch the beat -- have been not really constructive as we look at India, the South China Sea, Hong Kong issues, and just go around the perimeter. In the periphery things like trade have not lived up to the billing, unfortunately,” Stillwell said.The US seeks a constructive and result-oriented relationship that is fair and reciprocal with China, he said, adding that implies not just conversations but actions.In addition to talks on areas like North Korea, Pompeo during the meeting insisted on the Chinese disclosing all they know about how this pandemic began, to share all the information that they have that leads to saving lives, he said.“This is not about saving face; it’s about saving lives. And we insist that they live up to their agreements with the WHO and with the international health regulations to make open as this is beyond politics,” he said.“We have to understand and assess that, as I talk about a constructive and result-oriented relationship, that the words are fine but will be judged by the deeds. If we have words of peace but we have aggressive actions, then we’re going to have to increase the pressure to manage that,” he said. In this US is not alone, he added.“This is not a US-China event. It’s not a US-China issue. This is China versus lots of others. We just saw a very strong G7 statement on Hong Kong that demonstrates that it’s the world that’s concerned with this behaviour,” he said. “The objective of these talks was to help the Chinese government understand that their actions are actually working against them and that if they come to the table with a reasonable proposal, the US is obviously going to greet it reasonably and look for ways to work toward a positive outcome,” Stillwell said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-acts-on-indian-border-meant-to-take-advantage-of-covid-distractions-us-official/story-Tr2HLj81kNnmTRyT5hhxnL.html

We will remember the soldiers’ families, loved ones, and communities as they grieve,” Pompeo tweeted.Before this, the US said it is “closely monitoring” the situation between India and China after a violent face-off between troops of the two countries at the Line of Actual Control and had extended support to a peaceful resolution of the current situation.“We are closely monitoring the situation between Indian and Chinese forces along the Line of Actual Control. Both India and China have expressed a desire to de-escalate, and we support a peaceful resolution of the current situation,” a state department spokesperson said on Thursday.The spokesperson also referred to a June 2 phone call in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump had discussed the India-China border.“We note the Indian military has announced that 20 soldiers have died, and we offer our condolences to their families. During their phone call on June 2, 2020, President Trump and Prime Minister Modi discussed the situation on the India-China border,” the spokesperson said.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at the daily briefing President Donald Trump is aware of the situation on the India-China border and repeated a statement earlier issued by the state department spokesperson.The state department had earlier slammed the border tensions as a reflection of Chinese aggression going beyond the rhetoric and the House foreign affairs committee had blamed the Chinese for as well.“I am extremely concerned by the ongoing Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control on the India-China border,” Eliot Engel, the chairperson of the House foreign affairs committee, had said in a statement in early June.“China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbors rather than resolve conflicts according to international law,” Engel had said.India’s external affairs ministry said that both sides suffered casualties during the face-off and that China had departed from the consensus to respect the LAC in Galwan Valley.The face-off took place on late evening and night of June 15 in Galwan Valley as a result of an attempt by the Chinese troops to “unilaterally change” the status quo during de-escalation in eastern Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-secretary-of-state-mike-pompeo-condoles-death-of-indian-soldiers-in-face-off-with-chinese-troops/story-dyc12Xib4EhAFFzEG6vnSN.html

Flávio Bolsonaro, the president’s son, was arrested as part of a joint operation between public prosecutors of Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo states, the Rio prosecutors’ office said in a statement. The probe is into an alleged phantom employee corruption scheme.Images on local television showed police escorting him out of a property in Atibaia, a town in Sao Paulo’s interior. Local media reported the property belongs to Flávio Bolsonaro’s lawyer. Jandir Neto, a prosecutor involved in the case, said in a televised interview with CNN Brasil that it was a legal office, without specifying whose.Flávio Bolsonaro denied any wrongdoing and his lawyer, Frederick Wassef, didn’t respond to messages and calls from The Associated Press. Wassef is frequently seen in the presidential palace and the official residence, most recently yesterday when he attended the swearing-in ceremony of a minister.Bolsonaro was elected in 2018 on a wave of anti-corruption sentiment and with promises to clean up the capital, Brasilia. He’s seen his rejection levels rise as Brazil’s Covid-19 death toll climbed to the second highest in the world, and after the resignation of his popular justice minister, who alleged Bolsonaro sought to interfere politically in the Federal Police.The president said in a live broadcast on his social media channels that Queiroz’s arrest was designed to be a show. He also downplayed the risks for himself.“I am not Queiroz’s lawyer and I am not involved in this case,” Bolsonaro said. “May justice follow its course.”The arrest on Thursday comes on the heels of other probes targeting Bolsonaro’s allies, including activists, lawmakers and businessmen. Authorities on Monday arrested the leader of an activist group that backs Bolsonaro, accusing her of raising funds for anti-democratic actions. Federal Police on Tuesday carried out almost two dozen search warrants as part of the same investigation, and local media reported that the Supreme Court granted access to multiple lawmakers’ private banking records.″There are several investigations and operations from the police and the Supreme Court which are getting closer to Bolsonaro´s inner circle,” Maurício Santoro, a political science professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro, said in a text message. “The arrest of Queiroz is big news - and a huge concern for Bolsonaro.”In recent months, “Where is Queiroz?” became a rallying cry for Bolsonaro opponents who were dismayed that the former driver continued to elude authorities.President Bolsonaro in October said Queiroz, a former military police officer, had been his friend since the 1980s, but he hadn’t spoken with him since allegations surfaced.The investigation that yielded his arrest began when the government’s watchdog for financial transactions detected suspicious movements in his bank account, according to authorities. It is suspected the money may form part of a corruption scheme involving appropriation of salaries from phantom employees of Flávio Bolsonaro’s office while he was a lawmaker in Rio state’s legislature.The financial regulator has said that many of the payments to Queiroz came on pay days for people on Flávio Bolsonaro’s payroll. In December, Rio prosecutors carried out searches at 24 properties, including a chocolate shop owned by Bolsonaro.He said on Twitter that the operation is part of an attempt to damage his father’s administration.“I face today’s events with calm. The truth will prevail! Another piece was moved on the board to attack Bolsonaro,” the younger Bolsonaro said. “The game is rough!”A profanity-laced video released May 22 at the order of a Supreme Court justice, showed Bolsonaro at a Cabinet meeting in April expressing frustration with his inability to get information from police and vowing to change ministers if needed to protect his family and friends.The presidential press office didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment, and as of early afternoon Bolsonaro hadn’t made any comment on social media.Queiroz stopped working with Flávio Bolsonaro in October 2018. Paulo Marinho, a businessman and former ally of President Bolsonaro, told newspaper Folha de S.Paulo last month that Flávio Bolsonaro decided to fire Queiroz upon receiving leaked information that his aide would be targeted by an investigation.“The investigation will advance and could eventually hold Flávio Bolsonaro responsible,” said Michael Mohallem, a law professor at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a university and think tank. “Flávio isn’t just a son; he’s a politician and his father’s advisor. There’s been contamination of the president’s image. Bolsonaro, who already had his image as an anti-corruption leader eroded, will be hit further.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/arrest-of-ex-aide-to-brazilian-prez-bolsonaro-s-son-another-hit-for-leader/story-R83jbXdtX9LRe1JEAVxIkM.html

The second covers those who have visited Xinfadi wholesale farm-produce market or had close contact with relevant staff since May 30. The third includes people living in medium- and high-risk areas, a local official has said.Other residents should also avoid unessential travels outside Beijing and a negative nucleic-acid test certificate issued within the past seven days is a must for those who urgently need to leave the city.Late on Thursday, Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist of China’s Centre for Diseases Prevention and Control, said: “The epidemic in Beijing has been brought under control”.Going by recent case numbers, June 13 was the peak of the current outbreak, Wu told a regular news conference a day after new confirmed cases fell to 21, from 31 the previous day.“When I say that it’s under control, that doesn’t mean the number of cases will turn zero tomorrow or the day after,” Wu said.“The trend will persist for a period of time, but the number of cases will decrease, just like the trend that we saw (in Beijing) in January and February,” he said.Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), had earlier said the outbreak probably did not occur in early June or late May, but probably a month earlier.“A lot of asymptomatic or mild cases were detected in this outbreak and that is why the environment has such a large amount of virus,” Gao said at a seminar in Shanghai this week.Overall, China has reported 4,634 deaths and 83,325 infections from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-adds-25-more-covid-19-cases-tally-now-183-expert-says-city-outbreak-under-control/story-ZIMLyOvLLwq4Wps6ziyjyJ.html
19-06-2020||World||Nursing homes represent more than 1 in 4 Covid-19 deaths in US||Nursing home residents account for nearly one in 10 of all the coronavirus cases in the United States and more than a quarter of the deaths, according to an Associated Press analysis of government data released Thursday.As federal data collection becomes more robust, a clearer picture is emerging of the ravages of Covid-19 in nursing homes. About 1.4 million older and medically frail people live in such facilities, a tiny share of the American population that has borne a crushing burden from the pandemic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMost residents have been in lockdown since early March, isolated from families and friends, even in death.AP’s analysis of data from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services found that nearly half of the more than 15,000 nursing homes have reported suspected or confirmed cases of Covid-19 as of June 7. About 1 in 5 facilities — or 21% — have reported deaths.Nationwide, nursing homes reported nearly 179,000 suspected or confirmed cases among residents and 29,497 deaths. The latest figures include about 95% of nursing homes.Earlier this week, a special House panel on the coronavirus pandemic launched an investigation into the crisis in nursing homes.The vulnerabilities are many. Residents live in close quarters, usually two to a room before the pandemic. They shared dining and recreational areas, and physical therapy gyms. Many staff aides work in several facilities, so they can unwittingly carry the virus from one nursing home to another.Lawmakers are concerned “that lax oversight by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the federal government’s failure to provide testing supplies and personal protective equipment to nursing homes and long-term care facilities may have contributed to the spread of the coronavirus,” said committee Chairman James Clyburn, D-S.C. “Despite CMS’s broad legal authority, the agency has largely deferred to states, local governments, and for-profit nursing homes to respond to the coronavirus crisis.” But CMS chief Seema Verma has said that “trying to finger-point and blame the federal government is absolutely ridiculous.” She says nursing homes with poor ratings on infection control are more likely to have high numbers of cases, a claim that academic researchers say they have not been able to substantiate.Republican lawmakers also have blamed some Democratic governors who issued orders requiring nursing homes to take recovering coronavirus patients.New York rescinded its directive after Gov. Andrew Cuomo faced an outcry.The AP’s analysis also found that: — Among states, New Jersey had the highest proportion of nursing homes with suspected or confirmed Covid-19 cases, about 82%. This comprises 299 of the state’s 363 nursing homes.Massachusetts had the highest proportion of nursing homes with Covid deaths, nearly 66%. That represented 247 of the state’s 376 nursing homes.In 30 states, nursing homes’ share of Covid-19 deaths was higher than the national average of 26.7%. In some of the hardest-hit, such as Connecticut and Massachusetts, more than one-third of the state’s deaths occurred in nursing homes. The AP has previously reported a higher number of 45,500 deaths, but that count incorporates assisted living facilities, not just nursing homes, and includes staff. The federal data reported Thursday is for nursing homes, since CMS does not regulate assisted living facilities. Consumers will have access to coronavirus information through Medicare’s NursingHomeCompare website. They will be able to look up individual nursing homes to learn the number of cases and deaths among residents and staff. Data are expected to be updated weekly. CMS head Verma says nursing home reporting required by her agency will “constitute the backbone of a nationwide Covid-19 surveillance system” to identify and contain expected rebounds of the virus as communities reopen businesses and schools. The nation’s first major outbreak, reported in late February, was in a Seattle-area nursing home. The nursing home industry says it’s going to need much more help from the federal government to regularly test staff and residents. Facilities have also lacked adequate supplies of protective gear. The federal data release comes as many states have yet to meet a White House goal to test every resident and staff member for Covid-19. That was supposed to have happened before the end of May. Also unmet is a separate federal goal for state inspectors to assess all nursing homes for infection control. There is no deadline, but federal officials are growing impatient. As of a couple of weeks ago, only a few states had inspected all facilities. Even before the coronavirus pandemic, many nursing homes had “persistent” problems with infection control, according to a recent report from the Government Accountability Office, a watchdog agency for Congress. On a recent call with governors, Vice President Mike Pence said the federal government is going to be “marshaling resources” to speed up nursing home testing. But states and nursing homes have complained about a lack of tests. Thorough, methodical, ongoing testing of residents and staff is considered one of the keys to making nursing homes safer. Federal officials have recommended a one-time test for all residents and staff, as well as weekly retesting of staff. Nursing homes should retest residents weekly until none test positive. Verma says states should use “extreme caution” before reopening nursing homes to visitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nursing-homes-represent-more-than-1-in-4-covid-19-deaths-in-us/story-TVs198wE4Yf0frvljLTtlM.html
19-06-2020||World||Pakistan skips crucial meet with India to tackle locust menace||Pakistan on Thursday skipped a crucial meeting with India to tackle recent locust attacks that led to extensive crop damage in both countries, the ministry of external affairs (MEA) said.“As per the available information, Pakistan has refused to join the meeting which was proposed to be held today,” said Anurag Srivastava, MEA spokesperson on meeting between India and Pakistan on locust management.Officials from both India and Pakistan were expected to hold a technical level meeting on June 18. Islamabad had not given any formal response on the request to hold discussions over the issue earlier, according to the diplomatic sources.The Pakistan foreign office had said on June 5 that Pakistan and India are cooperating with each other to tackle the issue of desert locust under a forum administered by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).Pakistan and India are members of FAO’s Commission for Controlling the Desert Locust in South-West Asia (SWAC).Pakistan Foreign Office spokesperson Aisha Farooqui, in the weekly media briefing, had said that the ministerial meeting of the commission was held in March during which it was decided to reactivate communication between the member states on the locust situation and a Technical and Operational Coordination (ToC) team was formed to exchange information, enhance coordination at the border areas and increase synchronisation to combat desert locust outbreak in the region, Dawn reported.She said Pakistan had been participating in the SWAC meeting on a weekly basis. She said cooperation in exchanging information in bordering areas of Pakistan and India was “fruitful”, according to the report.“We believe that the respective technical teams have been coordinating appropriately through FAO,” she had said.Farooqui said that Pakistan “remains committed to cooperating with all SWAC member states, including India, in combating desert locust outbreak”.Pakistan and India are facing the worst locust attack in recent years. The desert locust is a species of locust, a swarming short-horned grasshopper and poses an unprecedented threat to food supply and livelihoods of millions of people.Locust swarms from Pakistan entered Rajasthan, Punjab, Haryana and Madhya Pradesh threatening standing crops. Rajasthan is the worst affected state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-skips-crucial-meet-with-india-to-tackle-locust-menace/story-rFuTUUR8IwE89W2KhFrosO.html
19-06-2020||World||Canada closes cross-border park where families reunited||British Columbia has temporarily closed a park where American and Canadian friends and families have been able to reunite despite the closed US-Canada border. Authorities said Thursday that Peace Arch Provincial Park in Surrey, British Columbia, had become too crowded, raising concerns about traffic and public safety during the coronavirus pandemic.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe park is adjacent to Peace Arch Historical State Park in Washington state. Visitors from both sides can cross the border without showing passports or other forms of identification, as long as they remain in the park. With the border closed to nonessential travel, the park has been one of the only options for separated friends and families to see each other. Some cross-border couples have even had their weddings there. But British Columbia officials say parking lots and access roads have been overwhelmed with nearly twice as many vehicles as typical peak summer traffic. Efforts to manage the number of visitors by posting signs, increasing patrols and limiting park hours have fallen short, they said. Officials have also noted that Canada recently changed travel restrictions to allow immediate family members of Canadian citizens and permanent residents to enter Canada to be with an immediate family member as long as they are asymptomatic of Covid-19 and self-isolate for 14 days on arrival. Authorities said they would reopen the park when they deem it safe to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-closes-cross-border-park-where-families-reunited/story-zfDWTegCrUvOlXa57pI17M.html
19-06-2020||World||Decline in new US coronavirus deaths may be temporary reprieve||The number of deaths per day from the coronavirus in the US has fallen in recent weeks to the lowest level since late March, even as states increasingly reopen for business. But scientists are deeply afraid the trend may be about to reverse itself.“For now, it’s too soon to be reassured that deaths are going down and everything’s OK,” said Dr. Cyrus Shahpar of Resolve to Save Lives, a nonprofit organization that works to prevent epidemics.Deaths from Covid-19 across the country are down to about 680 a day, compared with around 960 two weeks ago, according to an Associated Press analysis of data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The analysis looked at a seven-day rolling average of deaths through Wednesday.A multitude of reasons are believed to be at play, including the advent of effective treatments and improved efforts at hospitals and nursing homes to prevent infections and save lives.But already there are warning signs.For one thing, the number of newly confirmed cases per day has risen from about 21,400 two weeks ago to 23,200, the AP analysis found.And in Florida, Georgia, Texas and Arizona — states that loosened their stay-at-home restrictions early — daily deaths have been quietly rising since early June, said Ali Mokdad, professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington in Seattle.“These are not numbers. These are human beings,” Mokdad said. “We’re going to see a rise in deaths in many places in the United States.”The outbreak has killed about 118,000 people in the US and nearly a half-million worldwide, according to Johns Hopkins’ count, though the real numbers are believed to be higher. Potential vaccines are in early stages of testing, and it is unlikely any will be ready before early next year.Experts note that a rise in deaths could take awhile to show up in the US statistics. Stay-at-home orders imposed in March, combined with the use of face masks and other social-distancing measures, have been bringing down the daily death toll since mid-April, and the US as a whole is still seeing the positive effects, even though people are starting to work, shop and eat out again.Doctors watching for an uptick in deaths will be on the alert for certain signals to emerge in a specific order, Shahpar said.First, cellphone data will show people moving around more. Next, doctors will report more flu-like illnesses, and the proportion of people testing positive for the virus will rise. Hospitalizations will then go up and, finally, so will deaths.Several factors are believed to be pushing the curves for deaths and cases in opposite directions.Rising case numbers can partially be explained by the wider availability of testing. Mild cases, previously undetected because of limits on who could be tested, are now showing up in the numbers.As for the drop in deaths, “it is probably several things happening at once,” said Dr. Shmuel Shoham, a professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Lessons learned from the “awful early days” are now benefiting the severely sick and people in nursing homes, Shoham said.It looks that way in Washington state’s King County, where the first nursing home outbreak in the US killed 45 people at the Life Care Center in suburban Seattle. County data shows deaths in similar facilities declining over the past two months. And no single facility in the county has come close to the death toll at Life Care, which was struck unaware.While it is unclear how much specific treatments may have contributed to the decline in deaths, doctors are trying antivirals such as remdesivir, plasma donated from people who have recovered from the virus and steroids such as dexamethasone, which grabbed attention this week with reports confirming it can save the lives of many of the sickest patients.While all viruses mutate, scientists say the coronavirus so far is not changing in a way that has made it less deadly.The decline in deaths this spring might well be tied in part to warmer weather as people spend more time outdoors where circulating air disperses the virus. But that does not bode well for the US come this fall and winter.Mokdad noted that deaths are on the rise in the Southern Hemisphere, where it’s now winter.“This virus is going to have a second wave. It’s going to follow the pattern of pneumonia,” he said. “What we’re seeing in the Southern Hemisphere will be happening here.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/decline-in-new-us-coronavirus-deaths-may-be-temporary-reprieve/story-aBHguMhMeryJJzdvZErsIJ.html
19-06-2020||World||US has hit agreed troop-cut target of 8,600 in Afghanistan||The United States has reduced its troop presence in Afghanistan to 8,600, fulfilling its obligation as part of a February deal with the Taliban, the general who oversees American forces in that region said Thursday.Marine Gen. Frank McKenzie gave no indication of when, or at what pace, US forces would be further reduced. He noted that the February deal requires the US to fully withdraw its forces by next May, but he called that an “aspirational” commitment that would depend on certain actions by the Taliban.President Donald Trump has been eager for a full US withdrawal from Afghanistan, asserting that American forces are merely policing a civil conflict and should be brought home. The war began in October 2001.Without directly mentioning the 8,600 figure, McKenzie said, “We’re at that number now,” in accordance with the February agreement. The deal said the US would drop to 8,600 within 135 days, which is mid-July. It represents a reduction from about 12,000 troops at the time of the agreement.“We have met our part of the agreement,” he said, speaking at an Aspen Strategy Group webinar.McKenzie said a full US withdrawal would happen if conditions are right.“Conditions would have to be met that satisfy us that attacks against our homeland are not going to be generated from Afghanistan,” he said. “That’s not the Taliban. That is, of course, al-Qaida and ISIS,” referring to the extremist group that used haven in Afghanistan during the Taliban’s previous rule to plan the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States, as well as the Islamic State group’s Afghanistan affiliate.As part of the February deal, the Taliban agreed they would not allow any extremist group to use Afghan territory to plan or carry out attacks on the United States.“The jury is still very much out on that” Taliban commitment, McKenzie said, “and so we will watch the Taliban.” He added, “They have not yet completely made that case. There remains an opportunity for them to do it, but time is now beginning to grow short.”McKenzie spoke cautiously of trends in Iraq, where several thousand US troops are training and advising Iraqi forces and contending with periodic hostility from Iranian-backed militia groups. Although he praised recent efforts by the Iraqi government to deal with Iranian influences in the country, he cited “a beginning of a spike in unprovoked rocket attacks on Iraqi bases that host US forces.”He said he thinks Iran and its proxies in Iraq are conducting these recent attacks “because they have been unable to prevail in the political arena in Iraq.” He spoke after Iraqi authorities reported that four rockets exploded inside Baghdad’s fortified Green Zone near the American Embassy. It was the third such reported attack since the US embarked on strategic talks with Iraq’s new government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-has-hit-agreed-troop-cut-target-of-8-600-in-afghanistan/story-qhx32OVQ2QjonncKd6RafM.html
19-06-2020||World||UN: Venezuelans, other refugees face huge pandemic hardships||The head of the UN refugee agency expressed concerns Thursday about impact of the coronavirus pandemic from Africa’s Sahel region to Latin America and beyond, warning that millions fled upheaval at home and could face hardship abroad among lockdowns and other restrictive measures to fight the outbreak. UN High Commissioner for Refugees Filippo Grandi said 164 countries have either partially or totally closed their borders to fight Covid-19. Many people who flee abroad rely on the “informal economy” often involving day work with cash wages — economic activities that are at risk as governments ratchet up coronavirus lockdowns.“Of course, it is good that countries are taking these measures of prudence” against the virus, Grandi told the Associated Press ahead of the release of UNCHR’s “Global Trends” report on Thursday. “Unfortunately, UN-19, which has been able to cause the entire world to grind to a halt, has not been able to stop wars, conflicts, violence, discrimination.” “People are still fleeing their countries to seek refuge, to seek protection. This needs to be considered,” he added. Taking his appeal for government action to the UN Security Council by video conference on Thursday, Grandi said Covid-19 was becoming a “risk multiplier” on top of existing drivers like conflict, climate change, political upheaval and uprisings. “Take, for example, the region that perhaps worries me most at the present time — the region of Sahel in West Africa,” he told the council. ”This region is one of the leading regions in driving the displacement figures upwards, at least for the past couple of years, and it’s the theater of one of the most complex regional crises.” Grandi suggested a UN call for a global cease-fire in conflict areas during the pandemic had gone unheeded, and urged the Security Council to work to resolve conflicts that often spur displacement. “Since that call for a global cease-fire there’s been new internal displacement in 19 countries,” he said. “In the last two months, we have seen the growth of 700,000 internally displaced people globally.” The impact could also be stark for 3.7 million Venezuelans abroad, the world’s second-largest refugee group after the 6.6 million Syrians displaced by their country’s war. The Americas right now have become the world’s epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic. “One region about which we’re very worried is, of course, Latin America and South America and in particular where countries host many millions of Venezuelans,” Grandi said in the interview. “They are particularly hit by Covid.” In its “Global Trends” report, which found that the number of asylum-seekers, internally displaced people and refugees shot up by nearly 9 million people last year — the biggest rise in its records. That created a total of 79.5 million people, accounting for 1% of all humanity, seeking safety amid conflict, repression and upheaval. UNHCR chalked up the surge to a new way of counting people displaced from Venezuela and a “worrying” new displacement in the persistent trouble spots of Congo, the Sahel region of Africa, Yemen and Syria, which alone accounted for more than 13 million people on the move. While the total figure of people facing forced displacement rose from 70.8 million at the end of 2018, some 11 million people were “newly displaced” last year, with poorer countries among those most affected. UNHCR says forced displacement has nearly doubled from 41 million people in 2010, and five countries — Syria, Venezuela, Afghanistan, South Sudan and Myanmar — are the source of nearly two-thirds of people displaced abroad. Grandi also noted about 30% to 40% of the world’s refugee population lives in camps. He said Covid-19 hasn’t affected “in dramatic numbers” camps like those in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh — a country that has taken in nearly a million Rohingya Muslims fleeing from Myanmar — or in Africa. Amid the outbreak, UNHCR has stepped up its “cash transfer” programs that put money directly in the pockets of displaced people. Grandi says 65 countries now benefit from such programs “and we have added 40 countries in just the last few months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-venezuelans-other-refugees-face-huge-pandemic-hardships/story-6rGFSvvvLp3ejNcx7mbs3L.html

19-06-2020||World||Trump-appointed global media chief fires heads of 2 media companies, faces backlash||The new chief of US-funded global media is facing a conservative backlash over his decision to fire the heads of two international broadcasters, adding to concerns about the direction of the agency, which oversees the Voice of America and other outlets.The criticism of Michael Pack, who defended his personnel moves, is unusual because it’s coming from supporters of President Donald Trump who had backed his controversial nomination to run the US Agency for Global Media over staunch Democratic objections.Trump allies, including former adviser Sebastian Gorka, have offered public support for the ousted head of the Middle East Broadcasting Networks, Alberto Fernandez, while others have taken issue with the firing of the head of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Jamie Fly.Pack, a conservative filmmaker and onetime associate of Trump adviser Steve Bannon, sacked both of them late Wednesday in a purge of USAGM’s outlets, which also include Radio Free Asia and the Cuba-focused Radio/TV Marti. Those moves have alarmed Democrats who fear Pack intends to turn the agency into a Trump administration propaganda machine.“Every action I carried out was — and every action I will carry out will be — geared toward rebuilding the USAGM’s reputation, boosting morale, and improving content,” Pack said in a statement released by the new agency’s new public affairs staff.The statement called the moves “significant and long-overdue” and said Pack and his team are “committed to eradicating the known mismanagement and scandals that have plagued the agency for decades.”In addition to the agency chiefs, Pack dismissed veteran broadcast news executive Steve Capus, who had been a senior adviser to the organization and its leadership, according to two congressional aides and an AGM employee, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to discuss the matter publicly. Capus, who was previously president of NBC News for nearly eight years, did not respond to a query sent to an AGM work email address.And, he ousted the head of the Open Technology Fund, a non-broadcast arm of the AGM that works to provide secure internet access to people around the world. Last week, Fund chief Libby Liu submitted her resignation, effective in mid-July, but she was removed with the others.There was no public explanation of why Pack would dismiss any of the officials, let alone those favored by conservatives beyond the general statement of improving the agency.The firing of Fernandez, in particular, has raised conservative hackles. A former career diplomat fluent in Arabic, Fernandez had been hailed by conservatives for bringing what they saw as balance to the Arabic-language outlets AlHurra television and Radio Sawa.“Ambassador Fernandez was the greatest asset America had in foreign broadcasting,” Gorka wrote on Twitter shortly after the dismissals became public.Michael Doran, a former National Security Council and State Department official during President George W. Bush’s administration, called Fernandez’s ouster “asinine” and said that without him, “Pack will be as effective as a drugged bug in a bottle.”David Reaboi, a noted conservative national security analyst, was even more critical, calling Fernandez’s removal “shameful.” “It was unusual for the pro-American side to get represented, and Alberto always made sure it did,” he told the AP. “It was a model for recapturing territory from the far left and righting the ship.““Michael Pack gets confirmed by the Senate and, rather than take stock and talk to people who know what’s happening, he fired everybody,” Reaboi wrote. “Michael Pack destroyed that because he was too dumb to listen — or too dumb to be able to figure out the difference between friends and enemies.”The dismissal of Fly, a former staffer for Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., also attracted criticism, including from Mark Dubowitz, a well-known advocate of the Trump administration’s hawkish policies on Iran. “Poor decision to fire (Fernandez) and (Fly) whose exemplary leadership of MBN and RFE/RL respectively, made America’s public diplomacy more effective, more persuasive and more consistent with American interests and values,” he wrote.Juan Zarate, a Republican former NSC and Treasury staffer, agreed, calling the two dismissals “incomprehensible.” “I’ve watched both for years work with integrity to promote US interests abroad,” he wrote.In addition to Fernandez and Fly, Pack also removed the head of Radio Free Asia, Bay Fang, and the acting chief of the Office of Cuba Broadcasting on Wednesday. He replaced each outlet’s corporate board of directors with allies and installed himself as chairman of each.One of the people added to the board of Radio Free Asia, Jonathan Alexandre, attracted particular concern from Democrats who noted that he is also director of public policy for the conservative Liberty Counsel, a group that the Southern Poverty Law Center has designated a hate group for opposing gay rights.The director and deputy director of the Voice of America, Amanda Bennett and Sandy Sugawara, resigned from their positions on Monday. Taken together, top House Democrats who oversee AGM funding said Pack’s moves were dangerous.“That Mr. Pack took this drastic measure in his first week on the job is shocking, and we have deep concerns that he takes the helm of a critical agency with the intent to prioritize the Trump administration’s political whims over protecting and promoting independent reporting, which is a pillar of freedom and democracy,” said Eliot Engel, chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and Nita Lowey, chair of the House Appropriations Committee.The top Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey, denounced the firings as an “egregious breach” of the agency’s mission. Menendez had led an unsuccessful fight to block or at least delay Pack’s confirmation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-appointed-global-media-chief-fires-heads-of-2-media-companies-faces-backlash/story-16WlJ2RsfM12YV3yV8XB1I.html
19-06-2020||World||Bolton book shows Trump eager to help autocrats in US courts||President Donald Trump repeatedly sought to interfere in the US judicial system to curry favor with leaders from Turkey to China, according to a new book by former National Security Advisor John Bolton.At a Group of 20 meeting in 2018, Trump told President Recep Tayyip Erdogan that he thought a key Turkish bank facing a Justice Department indictment “was totally innocent of violating US Iran sanctions” and vowed to “take care of things,” according to Bolton.The book, which the White House has dismissed as “lies” and sought to block from going on sale next week, also describes how willing the president was to try to use a US prosecution and fines against a Chinese telecommunications company, ZTE Corp., as a bargaining chip in trade talks. A copy of Bolton’s book, titled “The Room Where It Happened,” was obtained by Bloomberg News.The details offer new evidence of Trump’s apparent willingness to inject his personal political priorities into US legal cases to win favors or impress leaders at odds with the US The president was impeached by the House last year for trying to withhold congressionally mandated aid to Ukraine to get that country’s government to pursue an investigation in former Vice President Joe Biden’s family.In repeated phone calls and meetings, Bolton says Trump asked aides including Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, his acting attorney general and other top aides to get senior Justice Department officials involved in the case against the Turkish bank, known as Halkbank. The financial institution was accused of being engaged in a massive scheme to evade sanctions on Iran.“Trump asked whether we could reach acting US Attorney General Matt Whitaker, which I sidestepped,” Bolton writes about the case, which was being prosecuted by federal officials in New York. “Trump then told Erdogan he would take care of things, explaining that the Southern District prosecutors were not his people.”Bolton describes numerous other meetings and phone calls where Erdogan brought up the Halkbank case. He describes Trump as largely uninterested in the case and instead focused on securing the release of Andrew Brunson, an American pastor held in Turkey at the time.The US later brought a criminal case against Halkbank, shortly after Turkey invaded Syria against the Trump administration’s warnings to stay out of the conflict.In the ZTE case, after the administration announced a seven-year ban on US exports to the company, effectively shutting down its operations worldwide, Trump reversed course and allowed the company to stay in business after paying a relatively modest fine of about $1.2 billion.In a passage that Bolton’s many critics in Washington will see as rich in irony, the former national security adviser says congressional Democrats pursuing impeachment charges against Trump would have had a better chance of finding “high crimes and misdemeanors” if they’d focused on those cases and not just Ukraine.Bolton declined to testify to House investigators last year without a subpoena, a process that could have held up proceedings indefinitely. When the impeachment case was sent to the Senate, the Republican majority prevented him from being called as a witness.Barr’s RoleIn the book, Bolton describes how he grew so concerned about Trump’s apparent willingness to disregard the US legal system that he felt compelled to raise the issue with Attorney General William Barr.”Specifically, however, I also wanted to brief him on Trump’s penchant to, in effect, give personal favors to dictators he liked, such as the criminal cases of Halkbank, ZTE, potentially Huawei, and who knew what else,” Bolton writes. “Barr said he was very worried about the appearances Trump was creating, especially his remarks on Halkbank to Erdogan in Buenos Aires at the G-20 meeting.”The Justice Department declined to comment on the allegations surrounding Halkbank, some details of which Bloomberg News reported last October. Pressed for a response, department spokeswoman Kerri Kupec highlighted a statement from January, after parts of Bolton’s manuscript were first reported by the New York Times, saying that his account of the conversation with Barr “grossly mischaracterizes” what they talked about.“There was no discussion of ‘personal favors’ or ‘undue influence’ on investigations, nor did Attorney General Barr state that the president’s conversations with foreign leaders was improper,” the statement said.Trump has also denied any impropriety in the ZTE case. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal published Thursday, he said Bolton wasn’t around for the ZTE action.“ZTE was my deal,” Trump told the Journal. “I put the fine on them.

19-06-2020||World||Facebook removes Trump ads with symbols once used by Nazis||Facebook has removed a campaign ad by President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence that featured an upside-down red triangle, a symbol once used by Nazis to designate political prisoners, communists and others in concentration camps.The company said in a statement Thursday that the ads violated “our policy against organized hate.” A Facebook executive who testified at a House Intelligence Committee hearing on Thursday said the company does not permit symbols of hateful ideology “unless they’re put up with context or condemnation.”“In a situation where we don’t see either of those, we don’t allow it on the platform and we remove it. That’s what we saw in this case with this ad, and anywhere that that symbol is used, we would take the same action,” said Nathaniel Gleicher, the company’s head of security policy.The Trump campaign spent more than $10,000 on the ads, which began running on Wednesday and targeted men and women of all ages across the US, though primarily in Texas, California and Florida.In a statement, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said the inverted red triangle was a symbol used by antifa so it was included in an ad about antifa. He said the symbol is not in the Anti-Defamation League’s database of symbols of hate. The Trump campaign also argued that the symbol is an emoji.“But it is ironic that it took a Trump ad to force the media to implicitly concede that Antifa is a hate group,” he added.Antifa is an umbrella term for leftist militants bound more by belief than organizational structure. Trump has blamed antifa for the violence that erupted during some of the recent protests, but federal law enforcement officials have offered little evidence of this.The ADL disputed that the red triangle was commonly used as an antifa symbol. The organization said the triangle was not in its database because it is a historical symbol and the database includes only those symbols used by modern-day extremists and white supremacists.“Whether aware of the history or meaning, for the Trump campaign to use a symbol — one which is practically identical to that used by the Nazi regime to classify political prisoners in concentration camps — to attack his opponents is offensive and deeply troubling,” ADL chief executive officer Jonathan Greenblatt said in a statement.The action comes as Facebook and other technology companies face persistent criticism, particularly from Democrats, about whether they are doing enough to police the spread of disinformation and tweets and posts from Trump perceived as inflammatory.Those questions arose during Thursday’s hearing when a Twitter representative was asked why the company flagged but did not remove tweets from the president, including one that raised the prospect of shooting looters during the recent unrest in American cities. Facebook, too, was asked why it did not remove a doctored video of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., last year that appeared to show her slurring her words.“If we simply take a piece of content like this down, it doesn’t go away,” Gleicher said. “It will exist elsewhere on the internet. People who are looking for it will still find it.”With Thursday’s hearing focused on the spread of disinformation tied to the 2020 election, the companies said they had not yet seen the same sort of concerted foreign influence campaigns like the one four years ago, when a Russian troll farm sowed discord online by playing up divisive social issues.But that suggests the threat has evolved rather than diminished, said the executives, who pointed out that media companies controlled by the state were directly and openly engaging online on American social issues to affect public opinion. China, for instance, has likened allegations of police brutality in the U.S. to the criticism it faced for its aggressive treatment of protesters in Hong Kong last year.Preventing disinformation ahead of the election is a significant challenge in a country facing potentially dramatic changes in how people vote, with expected widespread use of mail-in ballots creating openings to cast doubt on the results and even spread false information.Facebook said Thursday that it is working to help Americans vote by mail, including by notifying users about how to request ballots and whether the date of their state’s election has changed.The Vote By Mail notification connects Facebook users to information about how to request a ballot. It is targeted to voters in states where no excuse is needed to vote by mail or where fears of the coronavirus are accepted as a universal excuse.“Providing that accurate information is one of the best ways to mitigate those kinds of threats,” Gleicher said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-removes-trump-ads-with-symbols-once-used-by-nazis/story-rPrtpbrH8Ah4zzLGFisKWI.html
19-06-2020||World||Trump says ‘complete decoupling’ from China remains an option||President Donald Trump said the US could pursue a “complete decoupling from China” in response to unspecified conditions, his most forceful statement yet on the souring ties with Beijing.In a tweet Thursday, Trump refuted comments a day earlier by US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, who said a full decoupling of the world’s two biggest economies was not “a reasonable policy option.”The tweet comes a day after Secretary of State Mike Pompeo met with Chinese official Yang Jiechi, amid questions over whether the nations’ trade pact will remain in tact. According to Pompeo, Yang said China is committed to maintaining agriculture purchases that were crucial to Trump’s support of the deal.Meanwhile, Trump’s former national security adviser, John Bolton, has cast new light on the deal by alleging that Trump told Chinese counterparts to help him win re-election by buying more US farm products.Trump has also ramped up his rhetoric against Beijing as the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread in the US Trump refers to the illness as the “plague from China,” and has accused the country of withholding important information in the early days of the outbreak.“I think the trade deal is a great deal. But ever since we got hit with the Chinese plague, I feel different toward everything having to do with China. And I’ve always been hardline on China,” he told the Wall Street Journal during an interview on Wednesday.Lighthizer told a congressional hearing on Wednesday that he believes US supply chains should be brought back from China, but that the countries’ economies should remain intertwined.“This issue of decoupling is a complicated one. Do I think supply chains should be brought back? Yes. Do I do think they should be brought back from China? Yes. Do I think they should be brought back from everywhere else? Yes,” Lighthizer said.“Do I think that you can sit down and decouple the United States economy from the Chinese economy? No, I think that was a policy option years ago,” he added. “I don’t think it’s a policy -- a reasonable policy option at this point.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-complete-decoupling-from-china-remains-an-option/story-PdhpxRRcOwSQ8iN5m6QU2H.html
