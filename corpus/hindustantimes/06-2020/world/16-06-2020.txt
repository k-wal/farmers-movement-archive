The days I can sell, I buy bread, potatoes and tomatoes,” Ali said. “Because of the collapse of the Syrian currency, prices have increased to the point where we don’t have the money to buy food and bread.”The opposition-held area where Ali, 35, and his family live in Idlib falls outside President Bashar al-Assad’s control, but the pound is still used there.The U.N. agency OCHA says the halving of its value since the beginning of May has pushed the price of basic necessities to record highs and further out of reach of the 4 million people in the area.Umri, 35, says the recent Eid al-Fitr holiday, marking the end of the Islamic fasting month of Ramadan, was a time for despair rather than celebration. “I hated my life,” she said.One of their daughters suffers from hearing difficulties and is unable to speak, and another is paralysed on one side, but they cannot afford medical treatment.“Food is a big problem for us. We cannot buy vegetables and most days they eat bread and nothing else,” she said.The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, uprooting more than 6.6 million in Syria and forcing 5.5 million to flee to neighbouring countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/for-syrian-family-with-16-children-life-at-turkish-border-only-gets-harder/story-ghAl9TTBzViaeYiKm2mUHO.html
16-06-2020||World||France sends police reinforcements to Dijon to quell unrest||The French government sent police reinforcements and a top official to the Dijon region Tuesday to quell four nights of unusually violent clashes between rival groups that have left several injured and cars burned and rattled the community.The exact reasons for the unrest are under investigation, but local officials say it appears linked to the drug trade and tensions between members of France’s Chechen community and other groups.Similar clashes erupted in the Mediterranean city of Nice in recent days, which the mayor attributed to tensions over drug territory between local Chechen residents and their rivals. Four people were reported injured there.The unrest in Dijon’s Gresilles neighborhood began last week after a 16-year-old from France’s Chechen community was attacked by local residents, according to the regional prosecutor.Members of the Chechen community called for revenge on social networks, and a group of 50 descended on the area Friday, according to a local police official. A pizzeria manager was seriously wounded by gunfire, and the next day some 200 people turned out, the official said.After tensions continued through the weekend, the interior minister ordered police reinforcements to the area and announced Monday that the government would take over management of the situation.Images from BFM television showed two cars and several garbage cans on fire Monday, black smoke rising over a leafy neighborhood of low-rise apartment buildings. Young people wearing hoods and masks carried metal bars or bats as they roamed the area, and a makeshift gasoline bomb in a plastic bottle lay on the pavement.A police helicopter circled overhead, and a dozen police vans lined a nearby street as firefighters sought to douse the scattered blazes. People looking out from nearby balconies covered their mouths from the smoke.The local administration says at least 10 people have been injured so far.As of Monday, no one had been arrested.Unidentified local residents told BFM they felt abandoned by police over the weekend.“The Chechen community came to make people respect its own laws,” Mayor François Rebsamen said. “There weren’t enough police” to take on such a large, well-armed group, he said.After the government sent reinforcements, Nunez visited the area to show support for the population and insisted that “no one should carry out justice themselves.”“At a time when we ... talk of violent police, racist police, the (officers) proved they are the guarantors of our republican order,” he said. He said the national reinforcements would remain in the area “as much time as necessary.”Graffiti on a nearby shopfront read “Long Live Putin,” in reference to Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose military fought Chechen militants in two wars in the 1990s and early 2000s. France offered asylum to many Chechens at the time, and there are now Chechen communities scattered around France.The unrest comes amid tensions between French police and the government. Amid protests around France over racial injustice and police brutality, the government said last week it would ban police from using chokeholds to subdue people. But the government backed down Monday after police themselves protested. France is experimenting with expanding the use of stun guns as a potential alternative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-sends-police-reinforcements-to-dijon-to-quell-unrest/story-qsJOSe5FQ6eKqe8sUdlrPN.html
16-06-2020||World||Biggest breakthrough, says PM Boris on dexamethasone drug trial results||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday called the life-saving results of a drug trial announced by the University of Oxford as the ‘biggest breakthrough’ so far in global efforts to find a vaccine or treatment for the coronavirus that has infected millions across the world.Soon after the university announced the results of the dexamethasone trial, the UK government announced its immediate adoption in hospitals treating patients, calling it the “the world’s first coronavirus treatment proven to reduce the risk of death”.Johnson hailed the trial’s results at the daily Downing Street briefing along with the chief scientific officer Patrick Vallance, and Peter Horby, professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases at Oxford, who said the drug is cheap, stable, widely available for the last 60 years and can be used immediately across the world.Johnson said: “I am delighted the biggest breakthrough yet has been made by a team of scientists here in the UK. I am proud of these British scientists. This drug can now be made available across the NHS. We have taken steps to ensure we have enough supplies, even in the event of a second peak.”Horby and Vallance stressed that the drug is effective only for certain patients: those who are on ventilator or need oxygen.The trial’s results show that the anti-inflammatory steroid dexamethasone can save the lives of people seriously afflicted by coronavirus, cuts the death risk by a third for those on ventilators, and by a fifth for those on oxygen.The university said that in March, the RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY) trial was established to test a range of potential treatments for Covid-19, including low-dose dexamethasone. Over 11,500 patients have been enrolled from over 175 hospitals.A total of 2104 patients randomly received 6 mg of the drug once per day (either by mouth or by intravenous injection) for ten days and were compared with 4321 patients randomised to usual care alone.Among the patients who received usual care alone, 28-day mortality was highest in those who required ventilation (41%), intermediate in those patients who required oxygen only (25%), and lowest among those who did not require any respiratory intervention (13%).It said: “Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in ventilated patients…and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only…There was no benefit among those patients who did not require respiratory support”.“Based on these results, 1 death would be prevented by treatment of around 8 ventilated patients or around 25 patients requiring oxygen alone,” the university added.Horby said: “Dexamethasone is the first drug to be shown to improve survival in Covid-19. This is an extremely welcome result. The survival benefit is clear and large in those patients who are sick enough to require oxygen treatment, so dexamethasone should now become standard of care in these patients. Dexamethasone is inexpensive, on the shelf, and can be used immediately to save lives worldwide.”Vallance added: “This is tremendous news…It is particularly exciting as this is an inexpensive widely available medicine. This is a ground-breaking development in our fight against the disease, and the speed at which researchers have progressed finding an effective treatment is truly remarkable”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biggest-breakthrough-says-pm-boris-on-dexamethasone-drug-trial-results/story-kbQv3i0AySNMzUR8RHrHbN.html

It came a day after the nation’s largest police department disbanded a plainclothes anti-crime unit long criticized for its aggressive tactics.“Body-worn cameras are only as powerful as the transparency that comes with them,” de Blasio said. “This is a good thing for everyone involved. … When people see this kind of transparency, it will build trust.”Starting in 2017, the NYPD began deploying 24,000 body cameras for its patrol force and other street units, the most in the nation. The previous policy required that the department make videos involving force public if the police commissioner found it would address a specific “public concern” and “preserve peace.”The new policy calls for mandatory release of footage within 30 days if an officer fires a gun and hits someone or could have caused injury, uses a stun gun, or makes use of any other force that causes harm. The videos will be posted on the internet after civilians who were involved have seen it first, the mayor said.A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from the Police Benevolent Association, the city’s largest police union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-policy-requires-nypd-to-release-body-camera-footage/story-PnpZ3CqqDmjmmyl8eUWDjI.html
16-06-2020||World||In longest closure since World War II, Eiffel Tower to reopen amid pandemic measures||Workers are preparing the Eiffel Tower for reopening next week, after the coronavirus pandemic led to the iconic Paris landmark’s longest closure since World War II.France’s tourism industry is opening back up, but the 324-meter (1,063-feet) tall wrought-iron tower won’t immediately welcome visitors the way it did before the country went into lockdown in March.Only limited numbers of people will be allowed in when the Eiffel Tower opens again on June 25. Elevators to the top will be out of service, and only the first and second floors will be accessible to the public.“At first, only visits by the stairs will be available,” Victoria Klahr, the spokeswoman for the tower’s management, said Tuesday.Everyone over 11 years old will be required to wear face masks, and crowd control measures will be in place.“We are optimistic that visitor numbers will pick up, even if it will likely be local tourists who visit the monument in the first weeks,” Klahr said.A stringent cleaning operation is in place and that will continue daily from next week.“There is a new protocol. (One) novelty is that the day cleaning teams will be able to clean all the points of contact every two hours, from the opening of the site to its closing,” said Eiffel Tower hygiene consultant Alain Miralles.Tourists planning trips to the City of Light are advised to book tickets to visit the Eiffel Tower online. The online ticket office is set to open Thursday.Paris tourism officials have expressed muted optimism about the city’s reemergence as a travel destination. Tourism levels have dropped by around 80% compared to the same month in previous years, they say.“To visit Paris now is quite exceptional, as we of course don’t have many visitors and we don’t expect this summer to be at the same level as previous ones,” said Corinne Menegaux, the director of Paris’s businesses and tourism office.She said the French capital remains welcoming and charming despite all the restrictions still in place.“Let’s also not forget that Paris is one of the greenest cities around so there are plenty of outdoor activities available that can be done with families,” Menegaux said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-longest-closure-since-world-war-ii-eiffel-tower-to-reopen-amid-pandemic-measures/story-ZS4VchPk0snQQQUP2cUpEO.html
16-06-2020||World||Karan Bilimoria elected president of UK business body||Karan Bilimoria, member of the House of Lords and a leading Indian-origin entrepreneur, was on Tuesday elected president of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the representative body of 1.9 lakh UK companies employing nearly 7 million people. Hyderbabad-born Bilimoria, 58, was elected by an overwhelming majority at CBI’s annual general meeting to replace John Allan, who becomes the organisation’s vice-president. Cambridge-educated Bilimoria becomes the first CBI chief from a non-white background.The CBI said: “He is one of the country’s leading entrepreneurs. He founded Cobra Beer in 1989...and was also founding chairman on the UK-India Business Council. A former chancellor of Thames Valley University (now the University of West London); he was the youngest university chancellor when appointed”.“In 2014, he was appointed as the 7th chancellor of the University of Birmingham. He is also chair of the University of Cambridge Judge Business School Advisory Board. Lord Bilimoria has been an independent crossbench peer in the House of Lords for 14 years”, it added.Bilimoria said on his election: “Ensuring the CBI is seen as a home for entrepreneurs and SMEs is first among my top four priorities during my time as president. Secondly, establishing the UK as a trading powerhouse, which is vital for our future prosperity”.“Thirdly, I will use my background in higher education to champion the UK’s unique soft power offer. And last but by no means least is the importance of acting to increase inclusive workplaces. Diversity drives better decisions. And it will be my aim to get better Black, Asian, and Minority Ethnic (BAME) representation in boardrooms across the country,” he addedBilimoria has campaigned for easier and better visa terms for Indian and other international students coming to the UK, besides participating in trade and business links with Indian ministers and interlocutors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/karan-bilimoria-elected-president-of-uk-business-body/story-u4SIWG9Ytyo5s4a5zhivXO.html
16-06-2020||World||Beijing shuts city schools again as coronavirus cases spread||Beijing has ordered all schools to close in an escalation of containment measures as it struggles to halt a new coronavirus outbreak which has already spread to neighboring provinces.The Chinese capital on Tuesday lifted its emergency response to level two and said that people will have to be tested for the virus before being allowed to leave the city.The total reported number of infections has reached 106, according to the National Health Commission, while cases linked to the Beijing cluster have already been reported in two provinces in China’s northern region.While the decision to close schools and limit people leaving signals the severity of the growing crisis, officials have so far taken a more targeted approach towards the latest outbreak compared to similar resurgences in Wuhan and in the country’s northeast region. The stakes are higher in Beijing, where the country’s business and political elite reside, and an aggressive lockdown risks undoing China’s economic re-opening and nascent moves to restart travel with other countries.Salmon Shunned in China After Link to Beijing Virus OutbreakBeijing has restricted movement only in areas where new cases have been found. While taxis and cars from ride-hailing apps have been banned from leaving Beijing and passenger buses from some cities in nearby provinces have been halted, trains and most other forms of transport to and from Beijing remain open.The costs of imposing an across-the-board shutdown are too high as Beijing’s population is much larger than that of Wuhan, said Yanzhong Huang, professor at the Center for Global Health Studies of Seton Hall University.“A city-wide lockdown in Beijing would not only reverse the process of economic and social reopening, a key policy objective of the party, but also undermine considerably the government’s own narrative on the success of its anti Covid-19 campaign,” Huang said. “The social, economic, and political pain might be way too high to justify a city-wide lockdown.”Beijing on Tuesday closed another food market located near the financial district after a case linked to the original cluster was discovered. Eleven other food markets have been shuttered and almost 300 others sanitized, while nearly 30 housing compounds have been put under lockdown, local officials said.Key Three DaysHousing compounds and companies are collecting information from their residents or workers on whether they have been to or had contact with anyone who has been to Xinfadi, the fruit and vegetable market where the new cluster was first discovered. It supplies around 80% of the city’s farm produce and tens of thousands of people pass through daily.With mass testing and contract tracing underway, the next few days will be crucial in deciding whether to reinstate the strict measures in place during the height of China’s epidemic, when workplaces and restaurants were shut and social gatherings were banned.The city of more than 20 million has said it can test over 90,000 people a day. It tested more than 70,000 on Sunday.“Beijing’s reported cases in the next three days will determine where the epidemic is going,” Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist with China’s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told state television on Monday night. Those who have contracted the virus should display symptoms in around two days and if cases aren’t surging by then, it’s safe to say the outbreak has basically stabilized, said Wu.“There’s no obvious sign of family clusters, or cross-infection between patients,” he said.Zeng Guang, a senior expert with the National Health Commission, said he sees a high chance of a “mild second wave” when the number of infections increases in the next couple days before the spread is contained.“But even if the virus spreads across China and lockdowns have to be implemented, Beijing will not be the second Wuhan,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-shuts-city-schools-again-as-coronavirus-cases-spread/story-Y3JP3lfshdnkeamS5doSiP.html

Markley Arrington didn’t elaborate on the reasons for the evaluation during a virtual hearing held online, but authorities have said previously that Hunsaker had been diagnosed with an unspecified mental illness.Hunsaker is accused of killing 25-year-old Ashlyn Black in an unprovoked attack on May 24 after the two met on Tinder.They met for a few drinks at a bar before going to his apartment in Layton, authorities have said. He called 911 to report the slaying early Sunday morning and told police to shoot him, according to court documents. Hunsaker told police he choked and then stabbed her unprovoked as they cuddled, according to the document.Police found Black lying on the floor, suffering from multiple stab wounds. Emergency workers tried to resuscitate her, but she was pronounced dead of her injuries at the scene.If convicted, Hunsaker faces at least 15 years and up to life in prison. He didn’t speak during the hearing other than answering a few basic questions from the judge. Hunsaker appeared wearing a mask and jail scrubs from inside the Davis County jail, where he’s being held without bail.Black’s parents have called Hunsaker a “monster” who killed their daughter in “a crime as senseless as it was evil.”Black had worked during her life to be a “voice of those who could not speak out for themselves” and had a gift for working with special needs people, her family has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-accused-of-choking-stabbing-tinder-date-pleads-not-guilty/story-FyPUjHeJyGiBstKIbT4DEK.html

16-06-2020||World||Racism means black, Asian and minority communities harder hit by coronavirus: UK Report||A new study by Public Health England has confirmed that historic racism and social inequalities are contributing factors that increase the risk of black, Asian and minority communities contracting and dying from the coronavirus in the U.K.Britain’s government has been under heavy pressure to do more to directly address the issue after data consistently showed that coronavirus death rates were significantly higher for blacks and ethnic minorities compared to white people.The report, published Tuesday, didn’t look at genetic factors, but said it was clear that the pandemic “exposed and exacerbated longstanding inequalities” in the country. Relevant factors included “racism, discrimination and stigma, occupational risk, inequalities in the prevalence of conditions that increase the severity of disease including obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and asthma.’’Citing a strong association between economic disadvantage and COVID-19 diagnoses, it said black people and minority groups are more at risk because they are more likely to live in cramped housing, use public transportation and work in jobs with a higher risk of virus exposure.It added that historic racism and poorer experiences of health care or at work meant that minority groups are less likely to seek care, or demand better protective equipment at work.“Lack of trust of NHS (National Health Service) and healthcare treatment resulted in their reluctance to seek care on a timely basis, and late presentation with disease,” the paper said.The report said officials should start more comprehensive collection of ethnicity health data and ensure ethnicity is recorded in death certificates. It also recommended targeted messaging on smoking, obesity and improving management of common health conditions like diabetes.The report’s release has been controversial. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government has been accused of holding back the material when it published an earlier report on the issue.The first report looked at why black people and ethnic communities may be at higher risk from COVID-19, but made no recommendations and made no reference to the 17 sessions in which around 4,000 people offered insight on the issue.Tuesday’s report said that those consulted “expressed deep dismay, anger, loss and fear in their communities about the emerging data and realities of black, Asian and minority ethnic groups being harder hit by the COVID-19 pandemic than others.”Amitava Banerjee, associate professor in clinical data science at University College London, said that overall the disproportionate impact on minorities is “due not only to racism, but much more to do with ethnic inequalities in the social and economic determinants of health, which require urgent action.”On Monday, Johnson announced a commission to look at what more can be done to fight racial inequality in the U.K. Thousands protested across the country for two weekends in demonstrations spurred by the May 25 death of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/racism-means-black-asian-and-minority-communities-harder-hit-by-coronavirus-uk-report/story-9y5s5XWW3t5emd41WrinkK.html
16-06-2020||World||US President Trump signs police reforms order that seeks to cut use of choke holds||President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order to reform policing in the United States that seeks to discourage the use of choke holds to subdue suspects and creates a national database of tainted officers as antiracism demonstrations continue across the country and a protestor was shot in New Mexico by a private militia.“This is a big, big step -- a step that hasn’t been taken before,” Trump said before signing the order. “We have to break the old patterns of failure.”But, he went on to add, siding with law enforcement, “I strongly oppose the radical and dangerous efforts to defend, dismantle and dissolve our police departments, especially now when we achieved the lowest recorded crime rates in recent history,.”Trump’s executive order has essentially three key elements. It seeks to create a national database of police misconduct so that an officer with a record of aggressive behaviour doesn’t simply move to another state or department, as has been also envisioned by a sweeping police reforms legislation put forward by Democrats.Trump’s order will also seek to address the use of force. “Choke holds will be banned except if an officer’s life is at risk, the president said. Federal funding will be provided to police departments based on certification of their use of force. And training will be provided to officers on de-escalating situations.And, finally, the order will recommend a greater role for social workers and mental health professionals; for them to work closely with officers, when responding to certain calls.The US president said that he had met families of victims of police violence before coming out to sign the order.Earlier in New Mexico, the victim in the shooting, who was among protestors trying to pull down a statue of the Spanish conquistador in Albuquerque, is in critical but stable condition. Four shots had been fired at the protestors from the direction of a group of men in military garb and armed with semi-automatic weapons.State governor and city’s mayor, both Democrats, have condemned the shooting and said the statute will be pulled down. No arrests have been announced yet.Antiracism protestors have encountered counter protests in many instances. A bunch of them marched in support of law enforcement in Miami Sunday; they also chanted slogans in Trump’s support. Another group, which included motorcycle gang members, showed up in Bethel, Connecticut.President Trump’s executive order comes amidst rising calls to reform the police, sensitise its handling of minorities, specially African Americans, and de-militarise it. Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed by a white police officer triggering these countrywide protests, has decided to disband its police department, for one.New York city police has announced it is disbanding its anti-crime units, whose plainclothes personnel have been involved in many shootings across the city. The 600 officers of these units will be reassigned to other other department, commissioner Dermot F Shea said Monday, calling it a “seismic shift”.And congressional Democrats earlier introduced a sweeping legislation to outlaw choke holds, a technique used by police officers to subdue suspects, create a national database of tainted police officers to prevent them from being employed elsewhere and discontinue the practice of no-knock warrant, which allows law enforcement personnel to enter a property without a knock on the door or a warning.The order is already been called “police friendly” by critics. President Trump has been extremely supportive of law enforcement through this civil unrest, as before, and has shown little support for protestors or their cause. On Monday, the US embassy in Seoul, South Korea, removed a huge “Black Lives Matter” banner that had hung down the front of the building for several days attracting attention around the world. The orders to pull it down came reportedly from the state department leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-expected-to-sign-police-reforms-order-as-antiracism-protests-continue-in-us/story-fHFrAKR7ZmEUsQP9wvRXfL.html

16-06-2020||World||Kim Yo Jong: North Korean leader’s increasingly powerful sister||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s sister warned at the weekend that a Korean liaison office would soon be seen “completely collapsed”. On Tuesday, Pyongyang reduced it to rubble.Kim Yo Jong is one of her brother’s most trusted advisers and among the most powerful women in the isolated regime, but her public profile is mounting rapidly and she has been mooted as a potential successor.The first statement issued in her name came only in March this year, but in recent days and weeks, she has been at the forefront of Pyongyang’s denunciations of defectors in the South sending leaflets across the border.Officially she is only an alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, but in a weekend statement carried by the official KCNA news agency, she referred to “my power authorised by the Supreme Leader, our Party and the state”.Born in 1988, according to the Unification ministry, Yo Jong is one of three children born to Kim’s predecessor Kim Jong Il and his third known partner, former dancer Ko Yong Hui.She was educated in Switzerland alongside her brother and rose rapidly up the ranks once he inherited power after their father’s death in 2011.Her existence was barely known to the wider world until his funeral, when she was seen standing right behind Kim Jong Un on state television, looking tearful and ashen-faced.But more recently she has seemed to be constantly at her brother’s side. Yo Jong has “been very faithful in promoting him as the supreme leader, burnishing his domestic and international image, and helping him practically as his de facto chief of staff,” said Katharine Moon, a politics professor at Wellesley College in the United States.On their 60-hour train journey to Hanoi for his summit with Trump -- which collapsed without a nuclear deal -- Yo Jong was seen bringing him an ashtray when he stepped off for a cigarette break.There was “no doubt” that Kim has an exceptionally close relationship with his sister, said Yang Moo-jin, of the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul.“Jong Un and Yo Jong spent much of their lonely childhood overseas together -- I think this is when they developed something that is similar to comradeship, on top of sibling love,” he told AFP. Seat of honourThe North has never had a woman leader but speculation swirled over Yo Jong as a potential successor in the event of the death of her brother, after he was absent from public view for weeks earlier this year. Leadership has always been a family affair in the North, and she is now one of the most prominent members of the “Paektu bloodline” -- a Northern term for Kim Il Sung and his descendants, who have led the nuclear-armed country since its foundation.And analysts say that her portrayal in state media as the voice of Pyongyang’s anger over the activists -- and now a role in a highly visible action -- could be intended to bolster her credibility with the North Korean military and other hawks.Until recently, Yo Jong has been more associated with the North’s diplomatic efforts.An inscrutable smile played on her lips when she rode down an escalator at Incheon airport as her brother Kim Jong Un’s envoy to the 2018 Winter Olympics, becoming the first member of the North’s ruling dynasty to set foot in the South since the Korean War.Every detail of her visit was closely watched, from the clothes she wore to the bag she was carrying and even her handwriting.When she had a brief meeting with Seoul officials on arrival, the delegation’s titular leader Kim Yong Nam -- at the time Pyongyang’s ceremonial head of state and a man in his 90s -- offered her the seat of honour.The Games ushered in a rapid diplomatic rapprochement on the peninsula and she attended a series of summits as aide to her brother, sometimes straying into shot as he walked with US President Donald Trump or the South’s Moon Jae-in.But in keeping with the secrecy shrouding North Korea’s leaders, it is not known whether she is married.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-yo-jong-north-korean-leader-s-increasingly-powerful-sister/story-1mxo2Ip5jumt8wWbWyBKzN.html

Over 11,500 patients have been enrolled from over 175 hospitals in the UK.A total of 2104 patients randomly received 6 mg of the drug once per day (either by mouth or by intravenous injection) for ten days and were compared with 4,321 patients randomised to usual care alone.Among the patients who received usual care alone, 28-day mortality was highest in those who required ventilation (41%), intermediate in those patients who required oxygen only (25%), and lowest among those who did not require any respiratory intervention (13%).It said: “Dexamethasone reduced deaths by one-third in ventilated patients…and by one fifth in other patients receiving oxygen only…There was no benefit among those patients who did not require respiratory support”.“Based on these results, 1 death would be prevented by treatment of around 8 ventilated patients or around 25 patients requiring oxygen alone,” the university added.Peter Horby, professor of Emerging Infectious Diseases, said: “Dexamethasone is the first drug to be shown to improve survival in Covid-19. This is an extremely welcome result”.“The survival benefit is clear and large in those patients who are sick enough to require oxygen treatment, so dexamethasone should now become standard of care in these patients. Dexamethasone is inexpensive, on the shelf, and can be used immediately to save lives worldwide.”Vallance added: “This is tremendous news today from the Recovery trial showing that dexamethasone is the first drug to reduce mortality from Covid-19. It is particularly exciting as this is an inexpensive widely available medicine”.“This is a ground-breaking development in our fight against the disease, and the speed at which researchers have progressed finding an effective treatment is truly remarkable. It shows the importance of doing high quality clinical trials and basing decisions on the results of those trials.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-breakthrough-drug-dexamethasone-cuts-covid-19-deaths/story-UHqj9yfOWOGwbrcWwFCZfI.html

The rare announcement by PLA did not specify when the drill was held but said it was the armed forces’ Xizang (Tibet) Military Command that organised the exercise at heights over 4700 metres.The Xizang Military Command falls under the Chengdu Military region.The PLA’s announcement comes in the backdrop of the unprecedented escalation of India-China border conflict on Monday when three Indian soldiers were killed soon after a talk to deescalate the ongoing tension at the border descended into violence.Until late evening Tuesday, China was yet to confirm or deny reports that said the PLA had suffered casualties as well.It’s rare for the PLA to announce drills; it’s the state media, which do it from PLA’s handouts and visuals.Published in PLA’s online mouthpiece, the Lhasa-datelined report said the exercise focused on “…infantry and tank offensive formation, enemy firepower strike, initiation of attack, defensive counter-impact, in-depth attack, etc.”The exercise focussed on “…long-distance strike by tanks at enemy’s forward firepower points, infantry-guided maneuver of tank, tank-guided marching of infantry, fast maneuver of infantry facilitated by tanks”.The drill was a test check for coordination between infantry and tanks.“The participating troops included ground forces, battlefield service and airborne penetration forces. They have been brought to a completely unfamiliar high-altitude area, which set a severe test for the coordination between the commanders and different arms,” the report written by Ren Feng and He Penglei from PLA-sponsored China Military Online said.It was a stock-taking exercise too.After the drill was over, the battalion went through the problems and deficiencies exposed by it, the report said.China’s state-controlled media has in the past weeks carried out reports of PLA’s high-altitude drills, often connecting it with the ongoing border tension with India, which started in early May.On June 7, state media said the PLA had carried out a large-scale drill involving thousands of paratroopers to check its preparedness in transporting soldiers and armoured vehicles from the central Chinese province of Hubei to border areas to the northwest of the country.The largescale “maneuver operation” was done in the backdrop of the ongoing border friction with India, the nationalistic tabloid, Global Times and national broadcaster CCTV said in reports.The news on Chinese state media came out on a day when New Delhi said India and China will continue military and diplomatic engagements to resolve a weeks-old stand-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).This was after talks were held between delegations led by Lt Gen Harinder Singh, commander of Leh-based 14 Corps and egation led by Maj Gen Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region, at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/infantry-battalion-carried-out-high-altitude-tank-drills-in-tibet-says-china-s-pla-in-rare-announcement/story-8vYXqgn8Yjp7hrBdANXZ8L.html
16-06-2020||World||Imperial College London’s Covid-19 vaccine human trial to begin this week||A vaccine developed at Imperial College London will go into the human-trial phase this week in the hope that it will be available for mass vaccination in the spring of 2021, as another trial at the University of Oxford in its second phase is said to be “progressing quickly”.The college announced the human trial on Tuesday as new figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed that London has recorded the sharpest decline in the number of dead and cases in recent weeks. The capital was a hotbed in April and May.Unlike traditional vaccines based on a weakened or modified form of virus, or parts of it, the Imperial vaccine adopts a new approach using synthetic strands of genetic code (called RNA), based on the virus’s genetic material. Nearly 300 healthy volunteers are to receive two doses.Once injected into muscle, the college said the RNA self amplifies – generating copies of itself – and instructs the body’s own cells to make copies of a spiky protein found on the outside of the virus. Experts hope that this will train the immune system to respond to the coronavirus so the body can easily recognise it and defend itself against the virus in future.Robin Shattock from the Department of Infectious Disease at Imperial College who is leading the vaccine study, said: “From a scientific perspective, new technologies mean we have been able to get moving on a potential vaccine with unprecedented speed”.“We’ve been able to produce a vaccine from scratch and take it to human trials in just a few months – from code to candidate - which has never been done before with this type of vaccine. If our approach works and the vaccine provides effective protection against disease, it could revolutionise how we respond to disease outbreaks in future,” he added.ONS’s figures are considered more thorough than the daily numbers of the Department of Health, which only cover people who tested positive for coronavirus and died, whereas the ONS figures cover any death where coronavirus was mentioned as a factor on the death certificate.The ONS said that the number of deaths involving coronavirus continued to decrease across all English regions with the number of deaths in London falling below the five-year average. In Week 23, Wales had the highest percentage of all cause deaths above the five-year average with 14.8%.“In contrast, the number of deaths in Week 23 registered in London was 2.8% fewer than the five-year average, the first region in England to go below the five-year average since Week 13”, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imperial-college-london-s-covid-19-vaccine-human-trial-to-begin-this-week/story-NAgkQPIHYxFhZtVzcHLeKP.html

Israel’s obtaining of what it calls an “archive” of past Iranian nuclear work has, however, given the IAEA extra information on Iran’s previous activities.“If the three countries take such steps, Iran will have no other choice but to react accordingly,” Iran’s IAEA representative Kazem Gharibabadi was quoted as saying by the semi-official Fars news agency.The IAEA has also reported that Iran remains in breach of many of the restrictions imposed by its nuclear deal.Iran began breaching the accord after the United States withdrew in May 2018 and reimposed economic sanctions on Tehran.Britain, France and Germany, which remain in the deal, have accused Iran of violating the terms of its 2015 agreement, but hope to persuade Tehran to reverse course rather than join a U.S. maximum pressure campaign it imposed since withdrawing from the accord in 2018.Russia and China, the other participants in the deal, are likely to oppose the resolution. It would be put forward this week at the IAEA board of governors meeting for approval either by consensus or a vote.The Covid-19 outbreak has complicated the process with the 35 countries meeting virtually. Some member states, including Russia, have said decisions should be made when a physical meeting can take place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-wants-nuclear-watchdog-iaea-to-rebuke-iran-for-refusing-inspections/story-1g8LAg62qmL6k2bQ7mhUGK.html
16-06-2020||World||Salmon shunned in China after link to Beijing virus outbreak||A fresh outbreak of coronavirus cases in Beijing is being blamed on imported salmon, prompting a nationwide boycott of the fish.Salmon has been taken off the shelves in major supermarkets like Walmart Inc. and deleted from grocery delivery platforms across China, while top experts are warning people not to consume the omega-3 rich fish. Provinces and cities from Yunnan to Shanghai are testing the seafood at local wet markets for the virus.The backlash came after the chairman of a major fruit and vegetable market called Xinfadi, the site of over 100 newly-detected infections in Beijing, said that the virus was traced to the chopping board used by a seller of imported salmon.While it is unclear if the virus can be actually be transmitted through frozen food that’s later thawed, the furore has put a $700 million market for imported salmon at risk, dealing a blow to major exporters like Denmark, Norway and Australia.The swift shunning of salmon reflects China’s growing fears over the abrupt resurgence of cases in its capital city -- the cultural and political center of the country where 20 million people reside. Over 20 housing compounds have been placed under lockdown and some schools closed while local officials race to track down people who’ve visited or had contact with the Xinfadi market.Chinese authorities have contacted Norway seeking information about infection risk connected to the production of fresh salmon and the Scandinavian country aims to reply as quickly as possible to limit the impact on the industry, Norwegian Fisheries Minister Odd Emil Ingebrigtsen said in a statement on the government’s website Tuesday.“We have yet to find out whether human beings transmitted the virus to salmon, or salmon contracted the virus first,” said Zeng Guang, a senior expert with the National Health Commission, in an interview with state media on Sunday. He warned Beijing residents not to eat raw salmon or purchase imported seafood for the time being.Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist of China’s Center for Diseases Prevention and Control said on Sunday that the virus can survive on the surface of frozen food for up to three months and that the agency “highly suspects” contaminated goods as the source of the latest outbreak.Beijing Outbreak Grows to Nearly 100 Cases in Test for ChinaThe salmon boycott is another setback for exporters of the seafood to China, after the coronavirus pandemic caused sales in the first four months of the year to plunge over 30%. Prior to the crisis, the four biggest exporters according to China customs data -- Chile, Norway, Australia and Denmark’s Faroe Islands -- had seen demand steadily grow to $686 million last year due to rising middle-class incomes and a shift to healthier diets.The situation drove stocks of pork producers up on Monday, with Jiangxi Zhengbang Technology Co. jumping as much as 8.6% and Wens Foodstuffs Group Co. climbing as much as 4.7%. The gains were likely fueled by expectations that demand for the meat will rise as consumers shun seafood, said Ken Chen, an analyst with KGI Securities Co. in Shanghai.Local authorities across China are heightening their scrutiny of wet markets and the seafood sold there. In provinces like Yunnan, Hubei and Shandong, fresh seafood and equipment like chopping boards and knives are being tested for the virus. Wet market workers are also being screened.In a study published in April, researchers with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations concluded that the coronavirus is not known to infect aquatic food animals or contaminate their products.The risk “should be negligible” with “proper food handling and sanitation,” although their surfaces might potentially become contaminated when handled by people who carry the virus, scientists including Melba G. Bondad-Reantaso wrote.(Updates throughout with details on seafood testing, China seeking information from Norway)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/salmon-shunned-in-china-after-link-to-beijing-virus-outbreak/story-WgadJS4uLUlijFx7vGRiSN.html
16-06-2020||World||Trump’s Tulsa rally defies public health and protest concerns||Donald Trump’s resumption of his signature campaign rallies this week is intensifying criticism of his response to the biggest domestic crises of his presidency: The deadly coronavirus pandemic and widening protests over police brutality against Black Americans.The June 20 rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is shaping up as a nightmare scenario for public health officials. Trump plans to address supporters inside an arena that holds nearly 20,000 people, with no special capacity limits, despite concern that crowded, indoor events are ideal for transmitting the coronavirus.The campaign plans to give a mask and hand sanitizer to everyone who attends -- and require them to agree to a waiver absolving the campaign of liability if they get sick.Trump’s choice of venue and date are also proving fraught as he confronts the national outcry that has followed the death of an unarmed Black man, George Floyd, in Minneapolis police custody last month. Tulsa was the site of one of the worst episodes of racial violence in U.S. history -- the 1921 Tulsa massacre, when a White mob sacked a prosperous Black neighbourhood.While Trump has conceded an error in the scheduling -- he bumped the rally a day to avoid holding it on Juneteenth, which commemorates the end of slavery -- he is pressing ahead undaunted, and has said he plans to hold more of the events in other states with rising coronavirus cases, including North Carolina and Arizona.“To have an indoor rally, intentionally, at this very moment in time, is just not smart,” said Michael Mina, an assistant professor of epidemiology at Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health. “It puts people at risk. I think that it is liable to cause deaths.”The administration on Monday repeatedly downplayed the rising numbers of cases of Covid-19 in states including Texas, Arizona, Georgia and Florida. Both Trump and Vice President Mike Pence attributed the increasing caseload to expanded testing for the virus.“If we stop testing right now, we’d have very few cases, if any,” Trump told reporters at the White House. Pence said the administration was weighing the deployment of additional federal health officials to some states, adding that the Tulsa rally could proceed safely in part because “their hospital capacity is abundant.”On Twitter he said that “despite hyperventilating by some in the media, only 11 counties out of over 3,100 are seeing a true acceleration in new Coronavirus cases & less than 2% of counties show any significant increase in cases.”Mina said the growing number of infections is likely due at least in part to states lifting social distancing requirements. “As social distancing measures have been lifted, increasingly in many of these areas we are seeing that no place is immune to this virus, and it will travel where people travel,” he said.Oklahoma itself has had reported fewer than 10,000 cases of Covid-19, among the fewest in the country and one reason Trump’s campaign chose the state. But the head of Tulsa’s health department has warned against the rally, and the department said in a statement Monday that it “is concerned about the safety of any large gathering of people in enclosed spaces where social distancing is difficult to maintain.”The BOK Center in Tulsa, where the rally will be held, has canceled or postponed a series of other events, including concerts by Bon Jovi, KISS and Justin Bieber, over the next several weeks “in light of the ongoing Covid-19 situation and out of an abundance of caution,” according to its website. Other than Trump’s rally, the next scheduled event is July 30.Trump has boasted about a crowd so big that it’ll spill over into the nearby city convention hall, which he said holds 40,000 people. “I’m going to have 22,000 plus 40,000,” he said at the White House Monday. Brad Parscale, his campaign manager, has said more than 1 million people have requested tickets.“We’re going to talk about out nation, where we’re going, where we’ve come from,” Trump said. “And I can tell you on Covid or coronavirus or whatever you want to call it, plenty of names, tremendous progress is being made.”‘Wrong Time’Though Tulsa hasn’t experienced the kinds of protests, riots and looting that have convulsed some US cities this month, the arrest earlier this month of a pair of teenagers who the police said were jaywalking has evoked many of the same questions driving unrest across the USA major in the Tulsa Police Department is also under fire for saying in a radio interview that police shoot Black people “less than we probably ought to be based on the crimes.” In the same interview, he denied the existence of systemic racism.Trump and his supporters have pointed to the nationwide protests as an excuse for him to resume his rallies, arguing that if it’s safe enough for Americans to demonstrate on city streets against the police, he can invite thousands of his supporters to join him in arenas to build enthusiasm for his re-election. Health officials have regularly warned that the virus spreads more easily indoors.Yet the Tulsa World newspaper said in an editorial on Monday that “this is the wrong time and Tulsa is the wrong place for the Trump rally.”“We can’t see any way that his visit will be good for the city,” the paper said. “The public health concern would apply whether it were Donald Trump, Joe Biden or anyone else.”Parscale said Monday on Twitter that everyone attending the rally at the BOK Center, which is owned by the city, would have their temperature checked in addition to being issued masks and sanitizer. There’s no indication that attendees will be required or encouraged to wear the masks, however -- Trump has never worn a mask in public and has mocked Biden for taking the precaution.Meredith Matone, the scientific director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania, said in an interview on Monday that political rallies were “something where individuals are going to have to make their own risk assessment.”“I myself would not attend a rally without a mask and the ability to physically distance from people,” she said.Trump’s DecisionBut there’s no sign Trump is considering re scheduling the gathering again and it’s unlikely anyone else would cancel it. A spokeswoman for the city of Tulsa said the event was the responsibility of Trump’s campaign and the firm that manages the arena.“Every entity has the same access and constitutional right to hold events in public spaces,” spokeswoman Michelle Brooks said.A spokeswoman for the arena’s manager declined to comment. City officials have scheduled a news conference for Wednesday regarding the virus.The city’s mayor and Oklahoma’s governor, both Republicans, have generally supported the Trump rally, with caveats. Mayor G.T. Bynum encouraged the campaign to have “enhanced hygiene considerations for attendees” but that the city would “protect the free and peaceful exchange of ideas.”“I am excited to host the president on Saturday, June 20, as we celebrate restarting our economy and getting Oklahomans back to work,” the governor, Kevin Stitt, said in a statement last week.And Oklahoma’s lone Democrat in Congress, Representative Kendra Horn, stopped short of criticizing the president for holding the rally. She instead urged him to avoid divisive rhetoric “as our nation faces the health and economic consequences of a deadly pandemic and grapples with the tragic reality of systemic racism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-tulsa-rally-defies-public-health-and-protest-concerns/story-pMphaUlMQetcRoWLhi5wiM.html

The destruction of the office “broke the expectations of all people who hope for the development of inter-Korean relations and lasting peace on the peninsula,” deputy national security adviser Kim You-geun told a briefing. “We’re making clear that the North is entirely responsible for all the consequences this might cause,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-vows-to-respond-sternly-if-north-keeps-raising-tensions/story-EPIEs2Ym4nGsYN9h2CYsFL.html
16-06-2020||World||UK and EU see Brexit deal a step closer after Johnson call||The UK and European Union moved a step closer to reaching a deal over their future relationship, with the bloc’s top officials confident Boris Johnson is willing to compromise and the prime minister saying the prospects for an accord are “very good.”An hour-long video call on Monday between Johnson and the bloc’s leadership has injected fresh momentum into the deadlocked negotiations, according to people on both sides with knowledge of the conversation. The EU inferred from Johnson’s contributions that he is willing to soften his position and European officials told him they are ready to do the same.“I don’t think we are actually that far apart -- what we need to see now is a bit of oomph in the negotiations,” Johnson said in a pooled TV interview after the call. “The faster we can do this the better: we see no reason why you shouldn’t get that done in July.”Johnson’s first direct intervention in the discussions since the UK left the bloc at the end of January marks the start of six weeks of intensive discussions to reach an agreement. After three months of trade talks ended in stalemate, both sides wanted to use Monday’s meeting to assess whether a deal is still attainable before Britain’s final split with the bloc at the end of the year.In a sign that major obstacles remain, EU Council President Charles Michel warned the EU isn’t prepared to “buy a pig in a poke” in any rush to sign an agreement. In a Twitter post, he reiterated that the contentious requirement for a level competitive playing field between the two sides will be “essential” for any accord.“We won’t just speed up,” Michel’s spokesman Barend Leyts said on Twitter. “We have to remain focused on content and consequences.”Intensive TalksFormal discussions will resume on June 29 in a more concentrated format than the previous series of talks every three weeks. The British government, which has ruled out extending the December deadline for negotiations, had been pushing for the discussions to be sped up.In a sign that the EU is responding to that pressure, the two sides also committed to “if possible, finding an early understanding on the principles underlying any agreement” -- implying that an outline of a deal could be reached before it is fleshed out.While Johnson said he doesn’t want the talks “going on until the autumn, winter, as perhaps some in Brussels would like,” the UK last week agreed to a timetable that includes a negotiating round in mid-August. During the video call, Johnson didn’t set out a hard deadline, according to a person based in Brussels.Privately, officials from Brussels and London say they are focusing on reaching an accord between mid-August and a summit of EU leaders scheduled for mid-October.No BacktrackingJohnson told EU officials the UK is committed to the terms of the Brexit Political Declaration, which set out the broad parameters for the two sides’ future ties, a person familiar with the conversation said.The declaration includes some of the EU’s key demands but the British government has questioned it since agreeing to it, saying it isn’t legally binding. Previously, the bloc’s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, accused Johnson of backtracking on the commitments.Since the negotiations started, both sides have struggled to make progress on a free-trade agreement and other aspects of their future relationship, such as fishing rights and security cooperation. The UK still rejects the EU’s call for a level playing field, which would bind Britain to some European rules in areas such as state aid and environmental law.Those differences may not be irreconcilable, according an official with knowledge of the talks -- but neither side has yet broken with its key red lines. In particular, the UK is sticking to its refusal to allow the European Court of Justice to be involved in settling any disputes between the two sides, a key demand of the EU.Johnson’s call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Michel and other EU officials, came after he formally ruled out extending the negotiating period beyond the end of the year. Failure to get a deal by then would see Britain and the EU trading on World Trade Organization terms, meaning tariffs and quotas would be imposed at a time when the region’s economy is still reeling from the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-and-eu-see-brexit-deal-a-step-closer-after-johnson-call/story-2ONp85AxmBvjKIEBenDf2O.html
16-06-2020||World||Spain may quarantine UK visitors: Report||Spain is considering imposing a quarantine on visitors from Britain when it re-opens its borders next week, Spain’s Foreign Minister said, in response to a similar policy introduced last week for travellers to Britain.Arancha Gonzalez Laya told the BBC she hoped Britain would lift its restriction, making a reciprocal Spanish one unnecessary.“We will be in a dialogue with the UK to see whether or not we should be introducing reciprocity as they have different measures than the rest of the European Union,” she said in an advance excerpt from current affairs programme HARD talk.Britain, with more than 41,000 documented coronavirus-linked deaths, and Spain, with more than 27,000, have been two of the countries hardest hit by the pandemic.Both, along with other European countries, are in the process of easing lockdown restrictions that have included border closures.Spanish officials gave no mention of any quarantine curbs on Sunday, when the government moved forward the date for allowing European visitors back into the country to June 21 from July 1.In recent weeks, Spain has caused some confusion in neighbouring countries by repeatedly changing the date and conditions for lifting the ban on foreign visitors it imposed in March in response to the epidemic.Spain counts on tourism for about 12 percent of its economy and more than one in eight jobs, making it essential for the country to try and salvage some of the summer holiday season.Britain’s Finance Minister Rishi Sunak told Sky News on Sunday that the quarantine was among measures it would review, saying the government could make changes including introducing travel corridors with specific countries.Spain’s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spain-may-quarantine-uk-visitors-report/story-5QRAj0Gl12YF69XKhPUHYM.html
16-06-2020||World||UK unemployment rising ‘faster than during Great Depression’ due to Covid-19 crisis||The number of people in the UK claiming job-related benefits increased by a monthly 23.3% in May to 2.8 million, according to official figures released Tuesday that likely underestimate the heavy toll on the labor market of the coronavirus lockdown.The Office for National Statistics said the so-called claimant count —which includes both people who work on reduced income or hours and those who are actually unemployed — was 125.9% higher than in March, the month when lockdown restrictions were imposed.The statistics agency also said the number of people on payroll fell by 2.1%, or 612,000, between March and May.“If the public health crisis is just starting to ease, today’s figures show that the unemployment crisis is only just beginning,” said Tony Wilson, director of the Institute for Employment Studies.Wilson said that unemployment is rising faster than during the Great Depression in the 1930s and is set to top 3 million this summer.The actual spike in unemployment would have been much higher were it not for the British government’s Job Retention Scheme, which has been paying a big part of the salaries of more than 9 million people.Many companies have held off from cutting jobs during the lockdown as a result of the scheme, under which the government pays up to 80% of the salaries of workers retained, up to 2,500 pounds ($3,150) a month.Treasury chief Rishi Sunak has said that from August, firms will have to start making contributions to the salaries of workers that are retained but not working, and that the scheme will close two months later.That’s raised concerns that Britain will see a huge spike in the official unemployment rate, which stood at 3.9% in April. Government figures released Tuesday showed that 9.1 million jobs have been furloughed under the scheme by 1.1 million employers at a cost to the government of 20.8 billion pounds ($26 billion).Some of those furloughed workers will have returned to their jobs on Monday, as a result of the reopening of non-essential shops in England for the first time in nearly three months.It’s clear that not everyone will be able to sidle back into their jobs given that many firms are likely to go bust as a result of the lockdown. Figures last week showed the British economy shrank by a massive 20% in April alone.Unions and employers are urging more support from the government.

On Tuesday last week, the ministry said several Su-30 fighters, some of China’s most advanced jets, crossed into the same airspace and were also warned to leave.On Friday, the ministry said a Chinese Y-8, a propeller aircraft based on a Soviet-era design some of which have been retrofitted as surveillance aircraft, was warned too by Taiwan’s air force to leave the air space, again in the southwest.The Y-8 flight came a few hours after Taiwan said it had carried out missile tests off its eastern coast.Taiwan has complained that China, which claims the democratic island as its own, has stepped up military activities in recent months, menacing Taiwan even as the world deals with the coronavirus pandemic.China has not commented publicly on the last week of Chinese air force activity near Taiwan. Beijing routinely says such exercises are nothing unusual and are designed to show the country’s determination to defend its sovereignty. China has never renounced the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control. One of China’s most senior generals last month said China would attack if there was no other way of stopping Taiwan becoming independent.China is deeply suspicious of Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen, whom it accuses of being a separatist intent on declaring formal independence. Tsai says Taiwan is already an independent country called the Republic of China, its official name.The United States has stepped up its military activities near the island too, with semi-regular navy voyages through the narrow Taiwan Strait.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-continues-its-intrusion-into-taiwanese-airspace-with-advanced-su-30s/story-4f1DN3JAGHPQSdfjRw248O.html

Out of the total 148,919 infections, Punjab has reported 55,878 cases, Sindh 55,581, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 18,472, Islamabad 8,857, Balochistan 8,327, Gilgit-Baltistan 1,143 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 663.The ministry said that 111 more patients died in the last 24 hours. With the new deaths, the tally of persons who succumbed to the virus reached 2,839 and another 56,390 people have fully recovered so far across the country.According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 80,00,000 people and killed more than 4,35,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 2.11 million cases and more than 1,16,000 deaths. The COVID-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”.

16-06-2020||World||The first Covid-19 vaccines may not prevent infection||Desperation for a way to keep economies from collapsing under the weight of Covid-19 could mean settling for a vaccine that prevents people from getting really sick or dying but doesn’t stop them from catching the coronavirus.Although a knock-out blow against the virus is the ultimate goal, early vaccines may come with limitations on what they can deliver, according to Robin Shattock, an Imperial College London professor leading development of an experimental shot.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Is that protection against infection?” Shattock said. “Is it protection against illness? Is it protection against severe disease? It’s quite possible a vaccine that only protects against severe disease would be very useful.”As countries emerge warily from lockdowns, leaders are looking to a preventive shot as the route to return to pre-pandemic life. Fuelled by billions of dollars in government investment, vaccines from little-known companies like China’s CanSino Biologics Inc. and giants like Pfizer Inc. and AstraZeneca Plc are in development.At least one of the fastest-moving experimental shots has already advanced into human trials after showing an impact on severe disease -- but less so on infection -- in animals. Experts say such a product would probably be widely used if approved, even if that’s as much as it contributes, until a more effective version comes to market.“Vaccines need to protect against disease, not necessarily infection,” said Dennis Burton, an immunologist and vaccine researcher at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California.Still susceptibleThere are drawbacks, though. While holding the potential to save lives, such vaccines might lead to complacency in lockdown-weary nations, said Michael Kinch, a drug development expert who is associate vice chancellor at Washington University in St. Louis.“My guess would be that the day after someone gets immunized, they’re going to think, ‘I can go back to normal. Everything will be fine,’” he said. “They’re not going to necessarily realize that they might still be susceptible to infection.”Covid-19 is already thought to be spread by people without symptoms, and a symptom-preventing vaccine may create even greater numbers of them.Vaccines are among the most effective weapons against infectious disease, and prevent up to 3 million deaths a year, according to the World Health Organization. Yet few, if any, are 100% effective in all people who get them. For example, about 3% of people who get measles vaccine develop a mild form of the disease, and can spread it to others.130 shotsIn their attempts to confront a rapidly growing threat, developers are turning to technologies that have never been used successfully in humans. More than 130 shots are in the works for Covid-19 prevention, according to the World Health Organization.Vaccines work by presenting the immune system with a form of a germ -- or a key part of it -- preparing the body to respond when a real exposure occurs. When that happens, immune proteins called antibodies glom onto the virus, halting its entry to cells. Sometimes vaccines ramp up immune T-cells, which don’t do as much to prevent infections, but can slow and eventually stop their progression.The drugs and vaccines that might end the coronavirus pandemicA common approach to raising levels of antibodies is with injection of a virus that’s been inactivated or killed. About nine of these are in experimentation: One, made by China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd., led to high levels of Covid-targeted antibodies in monkeys.Another shot developed at the University of Oxford uses an innovative approach in which Covid genes are inserted into a different, harmless virus. Those make proteins that are recognized by the immune system, which raises defenses against a real infection.About a quarter of the experimental shots listed by the WHO, including two already in human studies, follow the same approach as the Oxford vaccine. One of the advantages of the technology is its speed. AstraZeneca, which is partnering with Oxford, has said it will begin delivering doses for the U.K. as soon as September, and will have doses for the U.S., which helped fund development, the following month.On Saturday, AstraZeneca and four European Union countries said they reached an agreement to distribute hundreds of millions of doses of the vaccine. Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech Ltd. also said over the weekend that results from testing its coronavirus shot in humans support advancement to final-stage studies.Antibody levelsHow the shot being developed by Oxford and AstraZeneca affects infections and infectiousness still isn’t clear. William Haseltine, a former HIV researcher at Harvard University, pointed out in a blog for Forbes that animals had roughly the same amount of viral genetic material, called RNA, in their systems, whether or not they’d received shots. Levels of antibodies against the virus weren’t as high as in very protective vaccines, he said.However, clinical signs of severe infection, like high breathing rate and pneumonia, were better in vaccinated monkeys. That might still make such a shot useful, according to Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.“That vaccine doesn’t look like it’s a knockout for protecting against infection, but it might be really very good at protecting against disease,” Fauci told the medical news website Stat.The vaccine will be a success whether it heads off infections or severe symptoms, AstraZeneca Chief Executive Officer Pascal Soriot said in a BBC interview. The vaccine’s progress to advanced studies was approved by an independent scientific panel, and the company is waiting to see how it performs, a spokesman said.Fauci’s NIAID is partnered with Moderna Inc. on a Covid vaccine test whose primary goal is to show their vaccine prevents people from developing symptoms, the company said June 11. Preventing infections is a secondary goal.Successful preventives must also bar onward transmission, said Dan Barouch, a researcher at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard University. Effective shots may allow some cells to become infected, but control the growth of the virus before it can be passed on to others, said Barouch, who is developing a vaccine with Johnson & Johnson. He said his efforts are aimed at a vaccine that prevents infections.Preventing illnessThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration is considering options for a vaccine that prevents illness.“We would potentially consider an indication related to prevention of severe disease, provided available data support the benefits of vaccination,” FDA spokesman Michael Felberbaum said in response to questions. “For licensure we would not require that a vaccine protect against infection.”Licensed vaccines including some against whooping cough have not been demonstrated to protect against infection with the pathogen that causes the disease but have been demonstrated to protect against symptomatic disease, Felberbaum said.The notion of using imperfect vaccines and therapies is “fine,” Kinch said. “That’s just practicality. And we may follow those up with more-perfect. There will never be a truly perfect vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-first-covid-19-vaccines-may-not-prevent-infection/story-3SjkO710WgkSrLwq5XtvFO.html
16-06-2020||World||Uncommon for Covid-19 to spread from mother to baby during pregnancy: Study||It is uncommon for Covid-19 to spread from a mother to her newborn child during pregnancy, according to a study which says the rate of infection is no greater when the baby is born vaginally, breastfed, or allowed contact with the parent. The research, published in BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics & Gynaecology, also found that babies that did test positive for Covid-19, were mostly asymptomatic. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAccording to the scientists, including those from the University of Nottingham in the UK, early reports had suggested that in order to reduce the risk of mother-baby Covid-19 spread, it was safer to have a caesarean, and isolate the baby from the mother at birth, as well as to formula feed the newborn. However the researchers said there was very little evidence to support these guidelines. In the current review research, the scientists systematically analysed 49 studies looking into this topic. The review included an analysis of 666 newborn babies, and 655 women (as some women delivered twins). According to the researchers, of the women who delivered their babies vaginally, only eight out of 292 (2.7 per cent) had a baby that tested positive for Covid-19. Of the 364 women who had a caesarean, they said, 20 (5.3 per cent) had a baby which tested positive for Covid-19. Based on these findings, the researchers said neonatal Covid-19 infection is uncommon, and also commonly asymptomatic in those babies who are affected. They said the infection rates were found to be no higher when the baby was born vaginally, breast fed, or allowed contact with the mother immediately after birth. “There has been a lot of concern around whether pregnant women should be concerned for the health of their babies if they contract Covid-19,” said Kate Walker, study co-author from the University of Nottingham. “We wanted to look at the outcome for babies whose mothers contracted the virus and see if the route of birth, method of infant feeding, and mother/baby interaction increased the risk of babies contracting the virus,” Walker explained. She added that the chances of newborn infection with Covid-19 is low. “We would also stress that a vaginal birth and breast feeding are safe for mothers who find themselves in these circumstances,” Walker said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uncommon-for-covid-19-to-spread-from-mother-to-baby-during-pregnancy-study/story-jS0QzcFWto2vvzFQzyZnmO.html
16-06-2020||World||Covid-19 immune response may remain stable for two months after diagnosis, scientists say||Immune response to the novel coronavirus remains stable in the blood of the majority of infected individuals almost two months after diagnosis, and possibly longer, according to an antibody testing study that may help contain the spread of Covid-19.Scientists from St. George’s University of London in the UK said antibodies were not detectable in everyone exposed to the virus, opening discussions on how best to interpret antibody and viral tests.The yet to be peer-reviewed study, published in the preprint repository medRxiv, sheds light on the duration for which people remain immune after contracting Covid-19, and provides insight into how different age and ethnic groups respond to infection. In the research, the scientists analysed the antibody test results from 177 individuals diagnosed with Covid-19, and measured the levels of antibodies against the novel coronavirus they had. According to the scientists, in patients with an antibody response, the levels of the immune molecules remained stable for the duration of the study (almost two months). Based on the study, the researchers said patients with the most severe infections who have the largest inflammatory response were more likely to develop antibodies. They hypothesised that this may be due to antibody responses working in parallel with an inflammatory response to severe disease.The scientists said a higher viral load may also lead to greater stimulation of the inflammatory and antibody development pathways.However, the researchers cautioned that further work is required to understand if and why this may be the case. Between 2 and 8.5 per cent of patients did not develop Covid-19 antibodies at all, they added. According to the scientists, this may be because the body’s defence response in these patients could be through other mechanisms like the immune system’s T-cells. Another option, they said, could be that relatively mild infections may be restricted to particular locations in the body, such as within mucosal cells of the respiratory tract, where antibody responses are dominated by a secretory immune system. The scientists also assessed the associations between different characteristics and antibody responses. They said older patients and those with other conditions, such as with hypertension and being overweight were also more likely to have an antibody response. “Our results provide an improved understanding of how best to use viral and antibody tests for coronavirus, especially when not every person exposed to the virus will have a positive response,” said Sanjeev Krishna, co-author of the study from St George’s, University of London. Krishna believes that interpreting the results from these tests can help in controlling the spread of the virus, as well as identifying those who may be immune to the disease. “We hope that by sharing our data at an early stage, this will accelerate progress towards effective use of test results around the world,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-immune-response-may-remain-stable-for-two-months-after-diagnosis-scientists-say/story-BUBqEAHbk75yjj0y8oxLcN.html

The cause of the smoke was not immediately known, and the coast guard reported no injuries.The local coast guard branch said the smoke was coming from the top desk of the Asuka II, one of Japan’s largest cruise ships.The cruise ship has been docked in Yokohama Port, west of Tokyo, since early April and no passengers were on board, Japanese media reported. Japanese authorities were checking other details including the number of crew members on essential ship duty and their conditions.Yokohama Port is where the Diamond Princess cruise ship earlier this year had a coronavirus outbreak that infected more than 700 people.

16-06-2020||World||North Korea destroys inter-Korean liaison office as tensions rise||North Korea has confirmed it destroyed an inter-Korean liaison office on Tuesday, as it continued to dial up pressure against rival South Korea amid stalled nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration.Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said the North destroyed the office to correspond with the “mindset of the enraged people to surely force human scum and those, who have sheltered the scum, to pay dearly for their crimes,” apparently referring to North Korean defectors who for years have floated anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border.The news agency did not detail how the destruction of the office was carried out, but said it was “tragically ruined with a terrific explosion.” Also Read: North Korea says it may send troops into parts of demilitarized zoneAlso Read: Kim Jong Un’s sister threatens South Korea with military actionThe North, which has a long track record of pressuring South Korea when it fails to extract concessions from the United States, has repeatedly bashed the South in recent weeks over declining bilateral relations and its inability to stop leafleting by defectors and activists.The detonation of the office came hours after the North’s military threatened to move back into zones that were demilitarized under inter-Korean peace agreements, which experts say could create security threats for the South along the land and sea borders.North Korea blew up an inter-Korean liaison office building just inside its border in an act Tuesday that sharply raises tensions on the Korean Peninsula amid deadlocked nuclear diplomacy with the United States.Seoul’s Unification Ministry said the building in the North Korean border town of Kaesong was destroyed at 2:49 p.m. It gave no further details.Photos from Yonhap News Agency showed smoke rising from what appeared to be a complex of buildings. The agency said the area was part of a now-shuttered industrial park where the liaison office was located.North Korea had earlier threatened to demolish the office as it stepped up its fiery rhetoric over Seoul’s failure to stop activists from flying propaganda leaflets across the border. Some experts say North Korea is expressing its frustration because Seoul is unable to resume joint economic projects due to U.S.-led sanctions.On Saturday night, Kim Yo Jong, the influential sister of North Korea’s leader, warned that Seoul will soon witness “a tragic scene of the useless North-South liaison office (in North Korea) being completely collapsed.” She also said she would leave to North Korea’s military the right to take the next step of retaliation against South Korea.In 2018 , the rival Koreas opened their first liaison office at Kaesong to facilitate better communication and exchanges since their division at the end of the World War II in 1945. When the office opened, relations between the Koreas flourished after North Korea entered talks on its nuclear weapons program.Earlier Tuesday, North Korea’s military threatened to move back into zones that were demilitarized under inter-Korean peace agreements. The General Staff of the Korean People’s Army said it’s reviewing a ruling party recommendation to advance into unspecified border areas that had been demilitarized under agreements with the South, which would “turn the front line into a fortress.”While it wasn’t immediately clear what actions North Korea’s military might take against the South, the North has threatened to abandon a bilateral military agreement reached in 2018 to reduce tensions across the border.Inter-Korean relations began strained since the breakdown of a second summit between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump in Vietnam in early 2019. That summit fell apart because of disputes over how much sanctions should be lifted in return for Kim’s dismantling his main nuclear complex.Kim later vowed to expand his nuclear arsenal, introduce a new strategic weapon and overcome the U.S.-led sanctions that he said “stifles” his country’s economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-appears-to-destroy-inter-korea-liaison-office-report/story-eo431xMP4FY1oKXPyv0OwJ.html
16-06-2020||World||Man shot during protest over Spanish conqueror’s statue||A man was shot Monday night as protesters in New Mexico’s largest city tried to tear down a bronze statue of a Spanish conquistador outside the Albuquerque Museum, prompting the city to announce that the statue would be removed until officials determine the next steps.The man was taken to a hospital and was listed in critical but stable condition late Monday, said Albuquerque police spokesman Gilbert Gallegos.A confrontation erupted between protesters and a group of armed men who were trying to protect the statue of Juan de Oñate before protesters wrapped a chain around it and began tugging on it while chanting: “Tear it down.” One protester repeatedly swung a pickax at the base of the statue.Moments later, a few gunshots could be heard down the street and people started yelling that someone had been shot.Gallegos said police used tear gas and flash bangs to protect the officers who intervened and detained those involved in the shooting. He said they were disarmed and taken into custody for questioning as police worked to secure the scene. He said detectives were investigating with the help of the FBI but he did not immediately release any other information.“The shooting tonight was a tragic, outrageous and unacceptable act of violence and it has no place in our city,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a statement. “Our diverse community will not be deterred by acts meant to divide or silence us. Our hearts go out the victim, his family and witnesses whose lives were needlessly threatened tonight. This sculpture has now become an urgent matter of public safety.”Democrat Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham issued a statement in which she took aim at the armed individuals, saying they were there to menace protesters. She said no matter who strikes first, there would be no room in New Mexico for any sort of escalation of what she called “reckless, violent rhetoric.”“The instigators this evening will be rooted out, they will be investigated, and they will be held accountable to the fullest extent of the law,” she said.The violence came just hours after activists in northern New Mexico celebrated the removal of another likeness of Oñate that was on public display at a cultural center in the community of Alcalde. Rio Arriba County officials removed it to safeguard it from possible damage and to avoid civil unrest ahead of a scheduled protest.A forklift pried the massive bronze statue of Oñate on horseback from a concrete pedestal. Cheers erupted among bystanders who saw the memorial as an affront to indigenous people and an obstacle to greater racial harmony, though several people also arrived to defend the tribute to Oñate.County Manager Tomas Campos said the statue was placed in storage for its own protection. He expects the three-member county commission to solicit public comment on what to do next with the public works project commissioned by the state in the early 1990s.“This is public property and I’m not going to allow it to be damaged,” Campos said. “Plus, I don’t feel like risking my sheriff’s deputies or state police to defend it.”The Oñate statues have been a source of criticism for decades.Oñate, who arrived in present-day New Mexico in 1598, is celebrated as a cultural father figure in communities along the Upper Rio Grande that trace their ancestry to Spanish settlers. But he’s also reviled for his brutality.To Native Americans, Oñate is known for having ordered the right feet cut off of 24 captive tribal warriors that was precipitated by the killing of Oñate’s nephew. In 1998, someone sawed the right foot off the statue — an incident that weighed in the decision to stash away the statue.Luis Peña of Espanola, an artist and computer network engineer, started a public petition last week to remove the statue in Alcalde. He said he was heartened to see it taken off display.Removal of the statue was followed by a few heated roadside discussions about local colonial history, under the gaze of a half-dozen sheriff’s deputies.Tony Valerio, 65, rushed to the site after a neighbor alerted him that the statue was being taken down.“He’s my hero. He brought a lot of good things to New Mexico,” Valerio said of Oñate. “What’s next? The Statue of Liberty?”Lujan Grisham, who has campaigned on her heritage as a 12th-generation New Mexican, called the statue’s removal a “step in the right direction” in an earlier Twitter post.By Monday evening, dozens had joined a celebratory gathering with Native American dancing and drumming outside the cultural center where demonstrators left hand prints in red paint on the empty statue pedestal.Meanwhile, the scene in Albuquerque turned into chaos as people ran for cover. Police in riot gear could be seen taking at least two people into custody following the shooting as some protesters heckled the officers. It was more than two hours before the area was cleared.Monuments to European conquerors and colonists around the world are being pulled down amid an intense re-examination of racial injustices in the wake of George Floyd’s death at the hands of police.Albuquerque city officials have promised to convene a council of community leaders and artists to consider the concerns about the public art piece.Titled “La Jornada,” the sculpture depicts Oñate leading a group of Spanish settlers to what was then the northern-most province of New Spain in 1598. The collection of statues includes an indigenous guide, a priest, women settlers and soldiers. The names of the families who accompanied Oñate are listed on plaques below as part of the “Wall of Spanish Ancestral Heritage.”“Recent calls for altering ‘La Jornada’ remind us that works of art often challenge communities to debate ideas, pursue empathy, grapple with multiple perspectives, reconcile conflict and interrogate history,” said Shelle Sanchez, head of the city’s Cultural Services Department.___Lee reported from Santa Fe.

To avoid the misperception that American taxpayer dollars were spent to benefit such organizations, he directed that the banner be removed.”On Tuesday morning, a huge banner commemorating the 70th anniversary of the start of the 1950-53 Korean War, which falls on June 25, was seen draping on the embassy building in Seoul. The black-and-white banner carries the image of a lone soldier blowing a bugle.The Black Lives Matter banner was seen as support of worldwide movements honoring George Floyd, a black man who died in handcuffs while a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck. His death last month has prompted weeks of protests in the United States and around the world with the same theme: Black Lives Matter.The US Embassy statement said its removal of the banner “is no way lessens the principles and ideals expressed by raising the banner.” It said it “will look for other ways to convey fundamental American values in these times of difficulty at home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-banner-removed-at-us-embassy-in-seoul/story-SeWNWiN8QbZI1b8oCZLXqN.html

16-06-2020||World||Hong Kong chief says opponents of security law are ‘enemy of the people’||Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday urged opponents of Beijing’s plan to impose national security legislation in the financial hub to stop “smearing” the effort, saying those who did were “the enemy of the people”.Beijing last month announced a plan to introduce legislation in Hong Kong to tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference.Critics see it as the most serious threat to a “one country, two systems” formula, agreed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997, aimed at ensuring its freedoms and role as a global financial centre.The Chinese government and Lam’s Beijing-backed city administration say the law will not curtail freedoms but will target a small number of “troublemakers” and help bring stability after a year of anti-government protests.“I urge opponents who still use the usual tactics to demonize and smear the work to stop because by doing this they become the enemy of the Hong Kong people,” Lam said before a cabinet meeting, referring to the legislation.“The vast majority want to restore stability, and have safety, satisfaction and employment.”Lam was speaking a year after Hong Kong’s biggest ever demonstration, when about 2 million people, according to organisers, marched against another bill the city wanted to introduce that would have allowed extraditions to mainland China.Critics saw that bill as a threat to judicial independence and though it was later withdrawn, protests broadened into a campaign for greater democracy and clashes with police intensified.This year, the coronavirus outbreak brought a lull in protests but they have resumed since Beijing announced the plan for the security law.Details have not been announced but it has been widely criticised, not only by democracy activists but by diplomats, lawyers and business leaders who also fear it could erode rights and freedoms.Lam also said the government was considering relaxing restrictions aimed at stopping the coronavirus but it was unlikely they would be completely scrapped.Hong Kong’s borders are almost fully closed and groups are limited to eight people although life is returning to normal.The rules have helped limit numbers at demonstrations, with police citing the coronavirus in rejecting applications for rallies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-chief-says-opponents-of-security-law-are-enemy-of-the-people/story-Xztry3sg40ZGV52VuXZvoN.html
16-06-2020||World||German neo-Nazi on trial for politician’s murder||A German neo-Nazi stands trial Tuesday on charges of murdering pro-refugee politician Walter Luebcke, in a case that shocked the country and highlighted the growing threat of right-wing extremism.Federal prosecutors believe the main suspect, 46-year-old Stephan Ernst, was motivated by “racism and xenophobia” when he allegedly drove to Luebcke’s house on June 1, 2019 and shot him in the head.Ernst is to appear before the higher regional court in Frankfurt alongside co-defendant Markus H. who is accused of helping Ernst train with firearms -- including the murder weapon.The killing has been described as Germany’s first far-right political assassination since World War II.The trial is expected to draw huge interest but seating in the courtroom will be limited because of coronavirus social distancing measures.Luebcke’s wife and two adult sons plan to attend the opening hearing.“Hatred and violence can have no place in our society,” they said in a statement. “All of us who stand for a free democracy must not fall silent, but take a clear position.”- Pro-refugee speech -Luebcke, 65, belonged to Chancellor Angela Merkel’s conservative CDU party and headed the Kassel regional council in the western state of Hesse.He supported Merkel’s 2015 decision to open the country’s borders to refugees during Europe’s migrant crisis and spoke in favour of hosting asylum seekers in a local town.Prosecutors believe Ernst and his accomplice attended a speech by Luebcke in October 2015 when the politician defended helping refugees and said anyone who didn’t agree with those values was “free to leave the country”.The remark was widely shared online and sparked a furious reaction from people on the far right.After the speech, Ernst “increasingly projected his hatred of foreigners” onto Luebcke, prosecutors said in the indictment.Following mass sexual assaults by migrants against women in Cologne on New Year’s Eve 2015 and a 2016 Islamist attack in the French city of Nice, Ernst allegedly began tracking Luebcke’s movements.Between 2016 and 2018, prosecutors say he worked with Markus H. to improve his skill with firearms, and the two are said to have attended right-wing demonstrations together.In the course of their investigations, prosecutors separately charged Ernst with attempted murder for allegedly stabbing an Iraqi asylum seeker in the back in 2016.They also uncovered a cache of weapons and ammunition belonging to Ernst, including revolvers, pistols and a submachine gun. Although Ernst initially admitted to killing Luebcke, he later retracted his confession and said Markus H. had pulled the trigger.But prosecutors maintain that while the accomplice “accepted and supported” the danger Ernst posed, he was not aware of concrete plans for an attack.- ‘Biggest threat’ -In 1993, Ernst was convicted for an attempted bomb attack on an asylum home. In 2009, German media say he also took part in neo-Nazi clashes targeting a union demonstration.But Ernst then slipped off the security services’ radar, fuelling criticism that German authorities weren’t taking the far-right threat seriously enough.German police came under fire years earlier for overlooking racist crimes after it emerged that a neo-Nazi terror cell, the National Socialist Underground, had killed 10 people, mainly immigrants, between 2000 in 2007.Luebcke’s killing was followed by a shooting at a synagogue in Halle, eastern Germany, that left two dead in October 2019, while another gunman shot dead nine people of migrant origin in the central town of Hanau in February this year.Several politicians have reported receiving far-right death threats in recent months, including Germany’s only black MP Karamba Diaby. Interior Minister Horst Seehofer has since declared far-right extremism the “biggest security threat facing Germany”.He has promised tougher security measures, including a crackdown on online hate speech.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-neo-nazi-on-trial-for-politician-s-murder/story-fh0GB2OfXSUEIL6QgGL5eI.html
16-06-2020||World||Over 8 million infected with Covid-19 globally||Global cases of the novel coronavirus reached over 8 million on Monday, as infections surge in Latin America and the United States and China grapple with fresh outbreaks.The United States still leads the world with the highest number of infections, about 2 million or 25% of all reported cases. However, the outbreak is growing fastest in Latin America, which now accounts for 21% of all cases, according to a Reuters tally.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBrazil’s Covid-19 cases and deaths have surged to make it the No.2 hot spot in the world.The first case was reported in China in early January and it took until early May to reach 4 million cases. It has taken just five weeks to double to 8 million cases, according to a Reuters tally. Global deaths stand at over 434,000 and have doubled in seven weeks. Although Brazil’s official death toll from the pandemic has risen to nearly 44,000, the true impact is likely far greater than the data show, health experts said, citing a lack of widespread testing in Latin America’s largest country.Click here to follow Covid-19 live updatesIn the United States, which has over 116,000 deaths, testing is still ramping up months after the start of the outbreak. After cases declined in much of the United States for weeks, many areas are now reporting record new cases and hospitalizations. Fears of a second wave in hard-hit states - or a failure to get a grip on the first wave in some others - have led health experts to plead with the public to wear masks, avoid large gatherings and maintain social distance.China is also grappling with a resurgence of the virus just as its economy is trying to recover from shutdowns earlier this year. After nearly two months with no new infections, the capital Beijing has seen a spike in cases linked to the biggest wholesale food market in Asia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-8-million-infected-with-covid-19-globally/story-8rgengEmEoFwTt2ASZnEPK.html
16-06-2020||World||Only US agencies failed to grasp HCQ’s benefits, says Trump as FDA revokes emergency use status||The US Food and Drug Administration on Monday revoked its emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine to treat Covid-19, but quickly came under fire from President Donald Trump, who said only US agencies have failed to grasp its benefit in fighting the coronavirus.Based on new evidence, the FDA said it was no longer reasonable to believe that hydroxychloroquine and the related drug chloroquine may be effective in treating the illness caused by the novel coronavirus.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe FDA also warned that the drugs have been shown in lab studies to interfere with Gilead Sciences Inc’s antiviral drug remdesivir - the only medicine so far to show a benefit against Covid-19 in formal clinical trials.The move comes after several studies of the decades-old malaria pills suggested they were not effective either as a treatment for or to prevent Covid-19.British scientists earlier this month halted a large trial after deciding that hydroxychloroquine was “useless” at treating Covid-19 patients.Hydroxychloroquine’s anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties suggested it might help Covid-19 patients, and the FDA authorized its emergency use in March at the height of a pandemic for which there were no approved treatments. The early enthusiasm was partly based on laboratory experiments in which the drug appeared to neutralize the virus. Chloroquine, which is not approved for any use in the United States and has more side effects, has not fared any better in human clinical trials. In March, Trump said hydroxychloroquine in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin had “a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine,” with little evidence to back up that claim. He later said he took the drugs preventively after two people who worked at the White House were diagnosed with Covid-19, and he urged others to try it.“I took it and I felt good about taking it. I don’t know if it had an impact, but it certainly didn’t hurt me,” Trump said on Monday.Trump said there had been “great reports” out of France, Spain and other places, without offering any evidence or further explanation. France is one of the countries that has already stopped using the drug for Covid-19 patients.US Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar said the drug is still being studied for possible use at an earlier stage of the disease.“A lot of the data that has come out that was more negative was people who were quite ill in the hospital,” he said.The drug can still be used with a doctor’s prescription, Azar noted. Any drug with US approval can be used in any way a doctor sees fit regardless of what it has been approved for.DRUG’S USE ALREADY IN DECLINEDoctors in recent weeks had already pulled back on the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19, after several studies suggested it is not effective and may pose heart risks for certain patients.The Infectious Diseases Society of America on Monday backed the FDA decision “to revoke emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine.”Half of hospitals responding to a mid-May survey conducted by the American Society of Health-System Pharmacists (ASHP) reported excess supplies of hydroxychloroquine that they expected to return to wholesalers.Current US government treatment guidelines do not recommend its use for Covid-19 patients outside of a clinical trial.France, Italy and Belgium late last month halted use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients. But the United States last month sent 2 million doses to Brazil, which has emerged as the pandemic’s latest epicenter.Hundreds of trials testing hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine as interventions for Covid-19 are still underway, including a US study designed to show whether hydroxychloroquine in combination with azithromycin can prevent hospitalization and death from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/only-us-agencies-failed-to-grasp-benefits-of-hcq-says-trump-as-nation-revokes-emergency-use-status/story-qKkWtTB1UjEPJX0TSHektL.html
16-06-2020||World||India slams Pak for raising Kashmir at UNHRC, asks it to ‘introspect’ its grave human rights situation||India on Monday ripped into Pakistan for raising the Kashmir issue at the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) here and expressed “serious concern” over Pakistan’s audacity to accuse others of “effecting a state-sponsored genocide.”Exercising its Right of Reply after Pakistan raised Kashmir at the 43rd session of UNHRC, Senthil Kumar, the First Secretary of India’s Permanent Mission called out Islamabad for misusing the rights forum and its mechanism and asked the neighbouring country to introspect on its grave human rights situations before extending unsolicited advice to anybody.Drawing the attention of the Council to crimes against humanity in Pakistan, New Delhi stated that enforced disappearances, state violence, forced mass displacement, extrajudicial killings, army operations, torture camps, detention centres, and military camps are a regular feature in Balochistan.Maintaining that India’s decision to revoke Article 370 of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir in August year does not have any external ramifications, Kumar said that the people have marched ahead despite Pakistan’s “nefarious attempt” to derail peace and prosperity. “It’s unfortunate that Pakistan continues to maintain its track record of misuse of the Human Rights Council and its mechanism. It’s a matter of serious concern that Pakistan being the only country in South Asia of effecting a state-sponsored genocide would have the audacity to accuse others of it,” Kumar said.“It’s questionable that a country of serious credibility issues would talk about human rights and self-determination. This country emerged out of religious fundamentalism and bloodshed and its history rigged with assassinations, coups and puppets running,” he added.Kumar elaborated on the human rights abuses and persecution faced by the minority communities in Pakistan. He talked about the misuse of Blasphemy in Pakistan to terrorize minorities and cited examples of systemic targeting of minorities through blasphemy laws.“Systemic misuse of Blasphemy in Pakistan has terrorized the minorities in Pakistan. The recent fate of two Hindu girls in Sindh, one Christian girl in Lahore, one Ahmadi lady in Chaleki, two professors from Khairpur are the examples of systemic targeting of minorities through blasphemy laws. The state of Pakistan is well manifested in the impunity in the murder of 65 transgenders in Pakistan since 2015,” Kumar explained.“Enforced disappearances, state violence and forced mass displacements, harassment, extrajudicial killings, army operations, torture, kill-and-dumps, torture camps, detention centres, military camps are regular features in Balochistan.India also pointed out that there was no information on the fate of 47,000 Baloch persons and 35,000 Pashtuns who have been missing till date. It added that sectarian violence has claimed over 500 Hazaras in Baluchistan and more than 100,000 Hazaras have fled Pakistan,” he added.

16-06-2020||World||Beijing Covid-19 cases cross 100 in 5 days, 2 lakh linked to cluster market screened||Beijing on Tuesday reported 27 more domestically transmitted Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, taking the caseload to 106 in five days, the sharpest rise for the city. The spike in cases has prompted lock down of dozens of communities, sealing of food markets and large-scale nucleic acid testing.The WHO has called Beijing’s new cluster infection a cause of concern, calling for a thorough and systematic investigation into the new outbreak in the city after not reporting a single case for nearly two months.Overall, China reported 40 new confirmed Covid-19 cases on the mainland on Monday, of which 32 were domestically transmitted and eight were imported.Of the domestically transmitted cases, 27 were reported in Beijing, four in Hebei Province, and one in Sichuan Province, the national health omission (NHC) said in its daily report.In Beijing, a city of more than 21 million residents, most of the new cases confirmed from June 11 have been linked to the now-closed Xinfadi market, a large wholesale market of fruits, vegetables, and meat in Beijing’s Fengtai district, according to the local health commission.Epidemiological investigations are ongoing into the cases which are seemingly not connected to the market.According to the official news agency, Xinhua, more than 8,000 dealers and workers at the Xinfadi market have received nucleic acid tests and are under medical observation.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Until Sunday, Beijing carried out nucleic acid tests on nearly 77,000 people in the neighbourhood of the primary site for the new outbreak.“About 200,000 people who had visited the market since May 30 were interviewed via door-to-door inquiries, calls, social media platforms and other methods. Nucleic acid tests for these people are underway while they are asked to stay at home for medical observation,” the Xinhua report said“Strict closed-off management has been implemented in a total of 21 residential compounds in the vicinity of the Xinfadi market as well as the Yuquandong commodities trading market in Haidian District, where new infections were also reported,” the report added.“The next three days will be a critical time for Beijing to face the epidemic, and the number of cases reported in the city during the next three days will determine the trend of the epidemic. Beijing was hit by the outbreak on June 11 but responded quickly on June 12 and 13, bringing the outbreak under control in time. For infected patients, the onset would be tomorrow or the day after tomorrow; if the number of reports do not increase, so to speak, (the epidemic) will basically remain stable,” Wu Zunyou, the chief epidemiologist, Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention told CCTV on Monday.The WHO, which is yet to send a team to inspect the primary infection cluster site, said Beijing’s situation is a matter of concern.“A cluster like this is a concern and it needs to be investigated and controlled—and that is exactly what the Chinese authorities are doing,” WHO’s emergencies director, Mike Ryan told a press conference in Geneva late on Monday.Ryan added that countries which have implemented an immediate and comprehensive spread of measures have generally been able to contain new clusters.“However, Beijing is a large city and a very dynamic and connected city, so there is always a concern,” he said, adding: “And I think you can see that level of concern in the response of the Chinese authorities, so we are tracking that very closely.”Ryan, according to reports from Geneva said the WHO had offered support to the Chinese authorities leading the probe and may reinforce its own team in Beijing in the coming days as the investigation grows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-covid-19-cases-cross-100-in-5-days-2-lakh-linked-to-cluster-market-screened/story-cZzwru3bVqwcKlEQCEl39I.html
16-06-2020||World||Justin Trudeau’s personal brand tied to Canada’s UN Security Council race||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau will face the biggest test of the impression his government has made on the international stage when elections for non-permanent seats to the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) are held on Wednesday. Trudeau has personally spearheaded the country’s campaign to secure a place on the council and even during the Covid-19 pandemic made multiple calls to leaders of several nations to secure their support ahead of the June 17 vote for the 2021-2022 term.On Monday, it tried to shore up its global image announcing that Canadian Armed Forces will provide “airlift support to transport urgently needed medical and humanitarian supplies” and these will be transported from distribution hubs in Africa, Europe and the Middle East on behalf of the World Food Programme and the World Health Organization (WHO). On Saturday, Canada’s foreign minister François-Philippe Champagne was dispatched to New York, where the United Nations is headquartered, and he will remain there and lobby Permanent Representatives of countries.Trudeau will “participate in a virtual event with Permanent Representatives to the United Nations, to highlight and conclude Canada’s campaign for a Security Council seat” on the eve of the vote, according to a statement from his office.Canada is vying for one of the two seats from the Western European and Others Group or WEOG. However, it is facing a “close contest”, according to analysts, because the challengers are Norway and Ireland, both of which have been campaigning for a seat longer than Canada.Trudeau will also call several world leaders on Tuesday, including his counterparts in Spain, Ethiopia and Saint Kitts and Nevis. But the most significant could be his call to Prime Minister Narendra Modi. India is near-certain to be elected to UNSC as it is running unopposed from the Asia-Pacific Group. However, as things stand, it is unlikely to vote for Canada despite Ottawa having assured New Delhi of its support. The reason, Indian officials explained, was not a difference with Canada but simply how international diplomacy is conducted with reciprocal arrangements in place with Ireland and Norway even before Canada entered the UNSC race.Both those nations have been in the running for a decade, while Canada only entered the contest in 2016, months after Trudeau’s Liberal Party was elected to form the government for the first time.If India does, in fact, not support Canada it will be a replay of the 2010 elections when it chose Germany and Portugal instead. Canada lost that election and has not figured on the UNSC since.Trudeau personally announced Canada’s candidacy in 2016, and now is trying to change New Delhi’s outlook by reaching out himself to Modi. The Canadian prime minister will hope that recent history does not repeat itself after he has invested so much capital in the campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/justin-trudeau-s-personal-brand-tied-to-canada-s-un-security-council-race/story-iO0E579oVK6072jtpYovJK.html
16-06-2020||World||UK begins trial of latest virus vaccine candidate this week||Scientists at Imperial College London will start immunising people in Britain this week with their experimental coronavirus shot, becoming the latest entry into the race to find an effective vaccine to stop the pandemic.In a statement on Monday, the British government said 300 healthy people will be immunized with two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine candidate developed at Imperial, which has been backed by 41 million pounds (USD51 million) in government funding.So far, the vaccine candidate developed by Imperial College London has only been tested in animals and in the laboratory, where it produced much higher levels of antibodies than would normally be seen in infected people.Many scientists have warned that the pandemic might only be stopped with an effective vaccine, which typically takes years to develop.“In the long term, a viable vaccine could be vital for protecting the most vulnerable, enabling restrictions to be eased and helping people get back to normal life,” said Robin Shattock, who is leading the vaccine research.The vaccine uses synthetic strands of genetic code based on the virus. Once injected into the muscle, the body’s own cells are instructed to make copies of a spiky protein on the coronavirus. That should in turn trigger an immune response so that the body can fight off any future Covid-19 infection.About a dozen vaccine candidates are currently in early stages of testing in thousands of people. There are no guarantees any will work but there’s increasing hope that at least some could be ready by the end of the year. Oxford University recently began an advanced study involving 10,000 volunteers, and the US is preparing for even larger studies in July that involve 30,000 people each testing different candidates, including Oxford’s and one made by the National Institutes of Health and Moderna Inc.Scientists have never created vaccines from scratch this fast and it’s far from clear that any will ultimately prove safe and effective. Still, numerous countries, including Britain, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the US, have already placed advance orders for millions of vaccines that could be available by the end of the year if they prove to be effective.The World Health Organization noted on Monday that there have been about 100,000 new cases reported every day for the past two weeks and that relaxed restrictions in many countries have led to a new surge of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-begins-trial-of-latest-virus-vaccine-candidate-this-week/story-kZXrVX2HD5tgLBSODB2G1O.html
16-06-2020||World||China warms to idea of four more years of Trump presidency||Donald Trump has argued frequently of late that China is rooting for Joe Biden come November’s U.S. presidential election. In Beijing, however, officials have come around to support four more years of Trump.Interviews with nine current and former Chinese officials point to a shift in sentiment in favor of the sitting president, even though he has spent much of the past four years blaming Beijing for everything from U.S. trade imbalances to Covid-19. The chief reason? A belief that the benefit of the erosion of America’s postwar alliance network would outweigh any damage to China from continued trade disputes and geopolitical instability.While the officials shared concerns that US-China tensions would rise regardless of who was in the White House, they broke largely into camps of those who emphasized geopolitical gains and those who were concerned about trade ties. Biden, the former vice president, was viewed as a traditional Democrat who would seek to shore up the US’s tattered multilateral relationships and tamp down trade frictions.“If Biden is elected, I think this could be more dangerous for China, because he will work with allies to target China, whereas Trump is destroying US alliances,” said Zhou Xiaoming, a former Chinese trade negotiator and former deputy representative in Geneva. Four current officials echoed that sentiment, saying many in the Chinese government believed a Trump victory could help Beijing by weakening what they saw as Washington’s greatest asset for checking China’s widening influence.The general assumption underlying their views was that little could be done to halt the slide in relations between the world’s two biggest economies. Thus, China needed to accelerate efforts to develop high-end indigenous industries, expand into developing markets and look for opportunities to work with nations in Europe and Asia to counter any US isolation efforts.Over the course of Trump’s term, the realization has taken hold in Beijing that opposition to China enjoys deep bipartisan support in an otherwise-polarized Washington. The coronavirus outbreak, which was first discovered in the country’s central city of Wuhan, has only hardened American views toward Beijing.‘Getting Worse’“I don’t think the election will change the relationship in a fundamental way. The deep feeling in the US is that the US should contain China,” Zhou said. “Whether Trump wins, or Joe goes to Washington, things will get worse.”Chinese officials, eager to avoid a repeat of their surprise when Trump upset former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2016, have been pressing American contacts for insights about who will win. Senior members of the American business community in Beijing say recent weeks have seen a sudden up tick in outreach from well-connected Chinese friends who in some cases haven’t contacted them for years.Although Republicans traditionally emphasized economic ties with China, Trump has moved the party in a more confrontational direction, challenging the country in virtually every area of the relationship from China’s territorial claims in the South China Sea to trade, public health, human rights and technology. The Democrats have largely supported those efforts, helping to pass legislation to support Hong Kong protesters and give more military aid to Taiwan.Even Biden, who had long backed an “engagement” strategy with China, adopted a harsher tone as the Democratic presidential primaries heated up. In recent months, Biden has described President Xi Jinping as a “thug,” lauded the “extraordinary bravery” of democracy demonstrators in Hong Kong and accused China of “predatory” trade practices. He labeled the mass detention of Uighur Muslims in the far Western region of Xinjiang “unconscionable.”Although Chinese officials continue to steer clear of criticizing Trump directly, Internet censors have allowed more nationalistic-tinged criticism of the US to circulate online. One foreign diplomat said China’s foreign ministry was “combative” and “angry” toward US officials.“Trump has destroyed a lot of goodwill,” said Wang Huiyao, an adviser to China’s cabinet and founder of the Center for China and Globalization. “At the start of the trade war, there were a lot of people who were pro-US, but they are now sympathetic to the hard-liners.”Trump has sought to capitalize on his reputation for confronting China in the election, despite his early praise for Xi’s handling of the coronavirus outbreak. In April, he told Reuters that “China will do anything they can to have me lose this race,” asserting without evidence that Beijing’s response to the virus was focused on a desire to see him lose in November.China’s foreign ministry reiterated its longstanding position that it never seeks to interfere in the internal affairs of other nations. In a possible sign that the two sides are seeking to manage the election year disputes, US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo was expected to meet top Chinese diplomat Yang Jiechi in Hawaii later Tuesday, according to two people familiar with the plans.US StabilityOne Chinese official said the election result didn’t matter since relations won’t improve either way. China’s best hope, they said, was that things didn’t deteriorate further.Some in Beijing are wondering aloud about Trump’s long-term impact on US stability, pointing to surging coronavirus cases, protests against police discrimination and speculation about whether the pandemic election might end in chaos. “The US as we know it may no longer exist,” said Gao Zhikai, a former Chinese diplomat and interpreter for Deng Xiaoping.Trump’s “America First” policies have created similar frictions in capitals that have traditionally been friendlier to the US, as he levies tariffs on key trading partners, presses allies for greater spending on collective defense, withdraws from multilateral agreements and supports the UK’s break from the Europe Union. Chinese officials privately acknowledge that a Democratic administration might prove more formidable if it worked with allies to present a united front.Even if a Biden presidency proved more difficult for Beijing, two current Chinese officials said he might open up more areas for cooperation such as restoring US participation in the Paris climate deal -- negotiated while he was vice president under then-President Barack Obama.“He supports working on topics like climate change, WTO reform and TPP,” said Wang. “There are areas where we can cooperate.”On a more personal level, some Chinese officials involved in trade negotiations with the Trump administration support a Biden victory simply so they can spend more time with their families, according to one person familiar with their thinking. China’s trade team shows up to work looking exhausted, the person said.Both sides may find it difficult to escape the pattern of confrontation no matter who wins. Huawei Technologies Co. executive Meng Wanzhou is still detained in Canada awaiting a decision on a US extradition request, while Beijing’s plan to impose a security law on Hong Kong has caused outrage in Congress and brought the countries’ “phase one” trade deal into question.“Nowadays in China people are becoming more and more clear about the US’s objectives,” said Zhou, the former Chinese representative in Geneva. “We have not yet reached the darkest hour in the relationship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warms-to-idea-of-four-more-years-of-trump-presidency/story-CUBbkd0y6E9aEpcwyLxclO.html
16-06-2020||World||North Korea says it may send troops into parts of demilitarized zone||North Korean state media said Kim Jong Un’s regime is reviewing a plan to send its army into some areas of the demilitarized zone separating the country from South Korea.The General Staff of the Korean People’s Army said it was on high alert, according to a report Tuesday on the official Korean Central News Agency, escalating its threats aimed at forcing South Korea to halt activists from sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border by balloon.“Our army is keeping a close watch on the current situation in which the north-south relations are turning worse and worse, and getting itself fully ready for providing a sure military guarantee to any external measures to be taken by the Party and government,” the army staff was quoted as saying by KCNA.North Korea didn’t provide details of what areas it meant but appears to be referring to a disarmed region near a now-shuttered joint factory park with South Korea in the western city of Kaesong and a closed joint resort on the east around North Korea’s Mount Kumgang, Yonhap News Agency reported.The plan doesn’t appear to call for a scrapping of the terms set out in the 1953 Armistice Agreement that ended fighting in the Korean War and led to a 4-kilometer (2.5-mile) wide demilitarized zone buffer to be set up across the peninsula. North and South Korea have about 1 million troops stationed near their ends of the buffer zone, making it one of the most heavily fortified borders in the world.North Korea has also called on South Korea to abide by the terms of a 2018 agreement between the two nations aimed at reducing accidental border clashes. The accord, seen as a landmark in reconciliation, led to the two Koreas to each destroy 10 front-line guard posts, enforce a ban on military exercises in the area and impose a no-fly zone.The announcement follows rising tensions with Seoul since two activist groups sent anti-Kim leaflets by balloon across the border into North Korea early this month. That prompted Kim’s younger sister to issue an unusual statement saying that it was “high time” to break ties with South Korea.The sister, Kim Yo Jong, said that the next action against the “enemy” would come from the army, raising memories of a decade ago, when North Korea shelled a South Korean island, killing four, and was suspected of torpedoing the South Korean warship, killing 46 sailors.South Korean President Moon Jae-in tried to defuse tensions by seeking to cancel the licenses of the two groups -- Fighters for Free North Korea and KeunSaem -- over the leaflets. That effort drew criticism from Human Rights Watch, whose Asia director, Phil Robertson, called the move “a blatant violation of freedom of association that cannot be justified with vague appeals to border security and relations with the North.”Millions of leaflets have flown across the border for more than a decade bearing messages critical of North Korean leaders, with the latest coming as Kim made fewer public appearances over the past several weeks than normal, leading to global speculation about his health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-says-it-may-send-troops-into-parts-of-demilitarized-zone/story-ULcBGfw63uFS08UFkrNr1I.html

Ryan said the finding that this virus genome “may represent a strain commonly transmitting in Europe” is significant but that verifying the hypothesis requires the sequences be shared.Ryan said the new cluster of cases in China was of particular concern given that Beijing had gone 50 days without a new case, but expressed confidence Chinese authorities would be able to contain it.In a story published earlier this month, the Associated Press found China delayed sharing critical virus information with WHO for more than a week after three government labs had decoded the information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-fully-expects-china-to-share-genetic-sequencing-of-new-coronavirus-cases/story-gVaxP3uqBtY1VkbeolgDjJ.html
16-06-2020||World||Coronavirus more efficient at infection after mutation; diseased lungs more receptive||The following is a brief roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for Covid-19, the illness caused by the virus.Virus mutation makes it more efficient at entering cellsA genetic mutation in the new coronavirus that significantly increases its ability to infect cells may explain why outbreaks in Northern Italy and New York were larger than ones seen earlier in the pandemic. Scientists at Scripps Research in Florida say the mutated virus was seen infrequently in March, but by April accounted for some 65% of cases submitted from around the world to the GenBank database run by the National Institutes of Health. The mutation, designated D614G, increased the number of “spikes” the virus uses to bind to and break into cells, and made them more stable, researchers found in the study undergoing peer review. In test tube experiments, the mutated virus was roughly 9 times more efficient at breaking into cells and infecting them. “The number - or density - of functional spikes on the virus is 4 or 5 times greater due to this mutation,” said study co-author Hyeryun Choe. It is not clear to what extent the changes affect symptoms and transmission, “but it is hard to believe they do not have some effect,” said Michael Farzan, another lead researcher. “However,” he said, “this particular virus changes slowly, so I wouldn’t expect anything as dramatic as D614G for a while. We don’t expect the virus to become more deadly, just more efficient at propagating itself.” Compared to virus particles without the mutation, the mutated viruses were just as vulnerable to treatment with antibodies from the blood of recovered coronavirus patients, the researchers said.Diseased lungs more receptive to coronavirus infectionNew data helps explain why people with respiratory conditions appear to be more vulnerable to coronavirus infections. The virus breaks into cells via a receptor protein on the cell surface called ACE2. People with conditions like asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, pulmonary hypertension, and smokers have more of the ACE2 receptors on their lung cells than healthy people do, researchers found. In their analysis of lung cell genes from 700 people with these conditions, they also found that other proteins in addition to ACE2 impacted the “viral life cycle.” This means genes for those proteins “can be potentially important for SARS-CoV-2 cell cycle and invasion/attachment,” they wrote in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. These other genes may also be potential “targets for treating and preventing severe COVID-19 cases,” they said. Virus has staying power on protective equipment; cotton may be kingA new study highlights the potential risks of handling personal protective equipment (PPE) items after use by front-line healthcare workers. Researchers contaminated eight different types of protective equipment and materials with virus, including nitrile medical examination gloves, reinforced chemical resistant gloves, N-95 and N-100 particulate respirator masks, coveralls made of Tyvek (a textile common in PPE clothing), plastic, cotton, and stainless steel. Under the experimental conditions, potentially contagious virus was still present - although at extremely low levels - after 21 days on a plastic visor, 14 days on stainless steel and Tyvek coveralls, 7 days on nitrile gloves and 4 days on chemical resistant gloves. But only an hour after virus particles were applied to 100% cotton fabric, the amount of active virus had decreased by 99.9%, and it was completely undetectable in less than 24 hours. “These results have direct relevance to infection prevention and control practices, laundering and waste handling protocols in healthcare settings,” the researchers write in a not-yet-peer-reviewed paper posted on Friday on the preprint server medRxiv. “These results suggest that the use of cotton-based fabrics in healthcare settings may present a lower risk during handling for subsequent decontamination and reuse.” Expert advice to combat sleeping trouble during pandemicFaced with the health and economic anxiety of life during the coronavirus pandemic, many people are having trouble sleeping. In the journal Behavioral Sleep Medicine on Saturday, the Society of Behavioral Sleep Medicine published a free article with links to two handouts, one for patients and one for doctors. Among the advice for patients: Keep a daily routine; get exposure to sunlight early in the day, preferably outdoors; find ways to socialize by phone or social media (but focus on sharing things that are uplifting or amusing); watch what you eat (and when); and turn off pandemic news coverage a few hours before bed and use the rest of the evening for more relaxing activities.

16-06-2020||World||Former adviser John Bolton faces ‘criminal charges’ if book released, says Trump||President Donald Trump has said that his former national security adviser, John Bolton, could face a “criminal problem” if he doesn’t halt plans to publish a new book that describes scattershot, sometimes dangerous, decision-making by a president focused only on getting re-elected.Trump said on Monday it would be up to Attorney General William Barr to issue any charges, but hinted that the matter would end up in court. “We’ll see what happens. They’re in court — or they’ll soon be in court,” Trump said about the book, set to be released early next week.The president accused Bolton of not completing a pre-publication review to make sure the book does not contain classified material. That contradicts statements from Bolton’s attorney, Chuck Cooper, who says his client worked painstakingly for months with classification specialists at the White House National Security Council to make changes to avoid releasing classified material.Barr echoed Trump’s accusation. During an event at the White House, the attorney general said administration officials who have access to sensitive information typically sign non-disclosure agreements that require them to go through a clearance process before they can publish something based on information they accessed in the job.“We don’t believe that Bolton went through that process — hasn’t completed the process — and, therefore, is in violation of that agreement,” Barr said. The Trump administration is “trying to get them to complete the process — go through the process — and make the necessary deletions of classified information,” Barr said.Bolton’s book, “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” was supposed to be released in March. Its release date was twice delayed and it is now set to be released next week by publisher Simon & Schuster.“Bolton covers an array of topics — chaos in the White House, sure, but also assessments of major players, the president’s inconsistent, scattershot decision-making process, and his dealings with allies and enemies alike, from China, Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany,” according to the publisher.“I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn’t driven by reelection calculations,” Bolton writes in the book, according to a news release from the publisher.In a recent op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal, Cooper accused the White House of using the pre-publication review process as a way to protect the president from embarrassment.He said he sent Bolton’s manuscript to classification specialist Ellen Knight on December 30, 2019. Knight and Bolton, who was Trump’s national security adviser for 18 months ending September 10, 2019, spent nearly four months going through the nearly 500-page book multiple times, “often line by line,” Cooper said.In a March 27 letter, Knight thanked Bolton for his efforts to address the classification issues, but said additional edits were required to ensure national security information was protected. She outlined her concerns in 17 single-spaced pages of typed comments, Cooper said. He said Bolton worked through that weekend and sent Knight a response the following Monday. Bolton accepted most of Knight’s suggestions and proposed alternative solutions to others, Cooper said.In mid-April, after resolving a shorter list of remaining issues, it appeared that the pre-publication review process had been finalised. Yet when Bolton asked for a letter confirming his book was cleared for publication, Cooper said his client was told his book had prompted “very delicate” interactions at the White House and there remained “some internal process considerations to work through.” Knight said she thought the letter might be ready soon, but more than six weeks later, Bolton still hasn’t received it.  On June 8, Bolton got a letter from John Eisenberg, the president’s deputy counsel for national security, who claimed that Bolton’s manuscript still contained classified information and that publishing the book would violate his nondisclosure agreements.“This is a transparent attempt to use national security as a pretext to censor Mr. Bolton, in violation of his constitutional right to speak on matters of the utmost public import,” according to Cooper. “This attempt will not succeed, and Mr. Bolton’s book will be published June 23.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-adviser-john-bolton-faces-criminal-charges-if-book-released-says-trump/story-8Nb5Q78CJXY8VVKGO75mHO.html
16-06-2020||World||Donald Trump announces major US troop cut in ‘delinquent’ Germany||President Donald Trump has said he is ordering a major reduction in US troop strength in Germany, a move widely criticized by members of his own party as a gift to Russia and a threat to US national security.“We’re putting the number down to 25,000 soldiers,” Trump said at the White House on Monday.The US currently has about 34,500 troops in Germany — far fewer than during the Cold War, when Germany was the central focus of American and NATO efforts to deter invasion by the former Soviet Union. In recent decades, Germany has hosted key American military facilities and provided a jumping-off point for troops deploying to the Middle East, including during years of conflict in Iraq.Trump faulted Germany for failing to pay enough for its own defence, calling the long-time NATO ally “delinquent.” “We’re protecting Germany and they’re delinquent. That doesn’t make sense,” the president said, referring to Germany’s failure thus far to attain a goal set by all NATO members in 2014 to spend at least 2 pe cent of gross national product on defense by 2024. Germany says it hopes to reach 2 per cent by 2031.Since his election in 2016, Trump has pushed for the 2 per cent as a hard target, and he has repeatedly singled out Germany as a major offender, though many others are also below the goal.In his White House remarks to reporters, Trump suggested his troop withdrawal decision was intended to punish Germany, noting that the presence of American troops is a boost to local economies.“Those are well-paid soldiers,” he said. “They live in Germany. They spend vast amounts of money in Germany. Everywhere around those bases is very prosperous for Germany. So Germany takes, and then on top of it they treat us very badly on trade.” In addition to the 34,500 US troops in Germany, there also are approximately 17,500 Defense Department civilians.The administration has contemplated a partial troop withdrawal from Germany since last year, and in recent weeks it became apparent that Trump was ready to move forward, although no decision had been announced.The decision was not discussed in advance with Germany or other NATO members, and Congress was not officially informed — prompting a letter from 22 Republican members of the House Armed Services Committee urging a rethink.“The threats posed by Russia have not lessened, and we believe that signs of a weakened US commitment to NATO will encourage further Russian aggression and opportunism,” Rep. Mac Thornberry of Texas wrote in a letter to Trump with his colleagues. Sen. Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, slammed Trump’s move as “another favour” to Russian President Vladimir Putin.Liz Cheney, a Republican from Wyoming, said last week that Trump appeared to be making a serious mistake.“America’s forward presence has never been more important than it is today, as our nation confronts the threats to freedom and security around the world posed by Vladimir Putin’s Russia and the Chinese Communist Party,” Cheney said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-announces-major-us-troop-cut-in-delinquent-germany/story-eUoUhv0x1vpPhgPRN3esYI.html

Sensory and motor tasks are designed to help the player improve cognitive functioning.“We’re proud to make history today with FDA’s decision,” Akili CEO Eddie Martucci said in a statement. “We’re using technology to help treat a condition in an entirely new way as we directly target neurological function through medicine that feels like entertainment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fda-approves-video-game-for-treating-adhd-in-kids/story-iU7CxUr9pz0no2h01cGDvO.html
16-06-2020||World||US senate to introduce policing changes, restrict chokeholds in emerging bill||Driven by a swift-moving national debate, Senate Republicans are on the brink of introducing an extensive package of policing changes with new restrictions on police chokeholds and other practices as Congress rushes to respond to mass demonstrations over the deaths of George Floyd and other black Americans.It’s a sudden shift of GOP priorities with President Donald Trump signalling support. The White House will announce its own executive actions on law enforcement procedures on Tuesday, a crush of activity that shows how quickly police violence and racial prejudice are transforming national politics.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell opened the chamber on Monday declaring that Senate Republicans are developing “a serious proposal to reform law enforcement.” While the emerging GOP package isn’t as extensive as the sweeping Democratic proposal, which is headed for a House vote next week, it is perhaps the most far-reaching proposed changes to policing procedures from the party long aligned with a “law and order” approach. Confronted with a groundswell of public unrest over police violence, in cities large and small nationwide, even the most conservative senators are joining the effort.Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, the sole African American Republican in the Senate, has been crafting the package set to roll out Wednesday. He said the chokehold, in particular, “is a policy whose time has come and gone.” Over the weekend, the shooting death of Rayshard Brooks by a white officer in Atlanta led to a renewed public outcry, more street protests and the police chief’s swift resignation.Democrats have said the GOP package doesn’t go far enough to match the outpouring of support for reforms. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer warned Republicans not to settle for minor changes.“Now is the time to seek bold and broad-scale change, not change around the margins,” Schumer said Monday.Two senior administration officials told reporters that Trump’s executive order would include establishing a data base that tracks police officers who have complaints about excessive use of force in their records.The officials said the executive order would also establish a national credentialing system that would give police departments a financial incentive to adopt best practices on such things as use of deadly force.The two officials briefed reporters on the executive order on the condition that they not be identified. They said that they expect major law enforcement trade groups to back the effort.With the political debate fluid, it is unclear whether the parties will be able to find common ground. The proposals share many similar provisions but take different approaches to address some of the issues. Neither bill goes as far as some activists want in their push to “defund the police” by fully revamping departments.The debate is changing almost daily, complicated by the fall election, with the Senate Republican majority at risk. McConnell, who is also up for reelection in November is backing the GOP effort after the death of Breonna Taylor when police entered her home in Lousiville. It’s a dynamic political environment in the aftermath of the killing of black Americans and the outpouring of protests and Black Lives Matter demonstrations that have overwhelmingly altered the national conversation.The Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to consider policing issues at a hearing on Tuesday.Central to the Republican package would be the creation of a national database of police use-of-force incidents, a way to improve transparency so law enforcement officers cannot transfer from one department to another without public oversight of their record. The Democrats have a similar provision.The GOP bill would encourage police body cameras and include a long-stalled effort to make lynching a federal hate crime.Additionally, the Republican package is expected to restrict the use of chokeholds by withholding certain federal funds to jurisdictions that continue to allow the practice, according to a Senate Republican unauthorized to discuss the pending bill and granted anonymity.While chokeholds have become a symbol of police brutality — and a ban is included in the Democrats’ bill — the maneuver is already banned in many departments. Police nationwide are far more likely to kill someone by shooting.Yet, the Republican bill does not go as far as the Democratic proposal, particularly on the the issue of “qualified immunity,” which aims to enable those injured by law enforcement personnel to sue for damages. The White House has said that is a line too far. As an alternative, Scott has suggested a “decertification” process for officers involved in misconduct.Still, Democrats signalled a willingness to look at the Republican approach for areas of common ground.Leading civil rights groups have backed the Democratic bill but it’s unclear if the Republican proposal will be extensive enough to gain broad support.At the same time, the large police union, the influential Fraternal Order of Police, said in a statement it is working with Congress and the White House on the proposals, having provided “feedback” on the Democratic bill and “substantial input” on the emerging GOP package from Scott.The House Judiciary Committee is set to consider the Democrats’ bill on Wednesday ahead of next week’s scheduled House vote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-to-introduce-policing-changes-restrict-chokeholds-in-emerging-bill/story-gPlYFqg2UHLqTGly75DVoM.html
16-06-2020||World||US Supreme Court extends workplace protection to LGBTQ community||The US Supreme Court on Monday extended workplace protection against discrimination to the LGBTQ community in a widely welcomed landmark judgment that was also a defeat for the Trump administration that had argued against providing these same rights on the question of social orientation.It was a 6-3 decision with Trump appointee Justice Neil Gorsuch writing the majority opinion. He was joined by Chief Justice John Roberts and the four liberal justices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Stephen G. Breyer, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan. Brett Kavanaugh, the other Trump nominee, dissented along with Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.“For an employer to discriminate against employees for being homosexual or transgender, the employer must intentionally discriminate against individual men and women in part because of sex.,” Gorsuch wrote in the majority opinion. “ That has always been prohibited by Title VII’s plain terms.”Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects employees from discrimination on the basis of race, color, sex, religion or national origin. The Trump administration and lawyers for employers had Title VII protections applied only to ensure there was no discrimination on gender or race, not on sexual orientation.“Fantastic news. No one in America should face discrimination for being who they are or for who they love,” said Bernie Sanders, Senator and former candidate for the White House, in a tweet. “Together, we are going to defeat the hate and bigotry of this administration and stand with our LGBTQ+ family. Congratulations to everyone who fought to make this happen.”Experts have said this ruling has far more significantimplications for the LGBTQ community and being allowed to marry. Not all gay and lesbian people marry, but they all work and need the workplace protections available to others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-extends-workplace-protection-to-lgbtq-community/story-fwufUA6FaxHi9Q2tLqF8DN.html
16-06-2020||World||Study reveals Covid-19 may present neurological symptoms before respiratory issues||A Northwestern Medicine study suggests that coronavirus poses a global threat to the entire nervous system, and its neurological symptoms may appear before fever or cough.A review of neurological symptoms of Covid-19 patients in the current scientific literature was conducted and the results are published this week in Annals of Neurology.About half of hospitalized patients have neurological manifestations of Covid-19, which include headache, dizziness, decreased alertness, difficulty concentrating, disorders of smell and taste, seizures, strokes, weakness, and muscle pain.“It’s important for the general public and physicians to be aware of this, because a SARS-COV-2 infection may present with neurologic symptoms initially, before any fever, cough or respiratory problems occur,” said lead author of the review, Dr Igor Koralnik, Northwestern Medicine chief of neuro-infectious diseases and global neurology and a professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.The review describes the different neurological conditions that may occur in Covid-19 patients and how to diagnose them, as well as likely pathogenic mechanisms.“This understanding is key to direct appropriate clinical management and treatment,” Koralnik said.The disease may affect the entire nervous system, including the brain, spinal cord, and nerves as well as the muscles. There are many different ways Covid-19 can cause neurological dysfunction, he said. Because this disease may affect multiple organs (lung, kidney, heart), the brain may also suffer from lack of oxygenation or from clotting disorders that may lead to ischemic or hemorrhagic strokes.In addition, the virus may cause a direct infection of the brain and meninges. Finally, the reaction of the immune system to the infection may cause inflammation that can damage the brain and nerves.Koralnik and colleagues have formed a Neuro-Covid research team and started a retrospective analysis of all Covid-19 patients hospitalized at Northwestern Medicine to determine the frequency and type of neurological complications, as well as response to treatment. Since knowledge about the long term outcome of neurologic manifestations of Covid-19, is limited, Koralnik also will follow some of those patients prospectively in his new outpatient Neuro-Covid clinic to determine if neurological problems are temporary or permanent. These studies will provide the foundation on how to diagnose, manage and treat the many neurologic manifestations of Covid-19, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-reveals-covid-19-may-present-neurological-symptoms-before-respiratory-issues/story-anY4iGILFoSbWZobsTxzvN.html
