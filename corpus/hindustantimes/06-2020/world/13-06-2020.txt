A PhD in Economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Fernandes has been part of Costa’s team since 2015.Fernandes’ family hails from Sarzora in Salcette, and retains links with the extended family in Panaji, where his grand-father, Leão Fernandes, taught in the Portuguese-era school in Altinho: Lyceum (today it houses the Goa bench of the Bombay high court).The media in Portugal quoted former minister Alvaro Santos Pereira as saying that Fernandes is an “excellent” choice for the key ministry. He held several academic roles before taking on policy-making responsibilities in the government.Prime Minister Costa, 58, heads the minority Socialist (PS) government since the October 2019 election. He was presented the Overseas Citizen of India card by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a visit to Lisbon in June 2017. Costa visited his ancestral home in Goa in early 2017.The Goa-Portugal link is one among several strands of the Indian disapora. Portugal was the first western country to colonise parts of India in the early sixteenth century, and the last to leave, on December 19, 1961.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-minister-adds-to-goan-link-in-portugal-government/story-c4Sj3ATKYOOA6de5d5z80L.html

The new cases at Xinfadi wholesale food market has raised concern among the people as it supplies 90 per cent of the capital’s vegetables and meat products catering to about 20 million people. Along with the Xinfadi market six other markets were closed on Saturday. Officials in Beijing found the coronavirus strand on a chopping board of imported salmon at the Xinfadi market following which the fish stocks were removed from Chaoshifa market, Carrefour and Wumart stores in the city. China imports about 80,000 tonnes of frozen salmon every year. Chile, Norway, Faroe Islands, Australia and Canada are the main exporters to China. Lin Li, chief scientist of a team that monitors aquatic disease and control in Guangdong Province, told the Global Times it is not possible for live salmon to be contaminated with the virus as it breeds in the ocean, neither can frozen salmon be a source of COVID-19 which can only exist in active cells. Forty-six people in Beijing have tested positive for the coronavirus over the last few days, the Global Times report said. Local municipal officials, who addressed the media, said they could not rule out the possibility of additional cases in Beijing. All the 46 positive cases were connected to local markets but none have symptoms. They are under close medical observation, Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the municipal centre for disease prevention and control, told a media briefing here on Saturday. Of the 517 samples taken at the Xinfadi wholesale market in Beijing’s Fengtai district, 45 people’s throat swabs tested positive for the virus. Another person connected to a market in Beijing’s Haidian district also tested positive, the daily reported. Forty environmental samples collected at the Xinfadi market also tested positive. Testing of some 10,000 people who have connections to the market began after six confirmed cases of COVID-19 were reported on Friday, following a single new confirmed case on Thursday. The new cases have brought a sense of disquiet in Beijing which in the last two months was being projected as safe. The government went ahead with its ten-day Parliament session and officially relaxed the guard with the municipal council recommending the people to do away with masks. In response to the emergency, Fengtai district has been put on “wartime” activity with close management of the 11 residential areas around Xinfadi market. Officials are manning the area at all hours, the report said. Three schools and six kindergartens near Xinfadi market have stopped classes. The risk level at Beijing’s Xicheng district for its Yuetan community has risen from low to medium. Beijing plans to carry out widespread nucleic acid tests of people who have had close contacts with the Xinfadi market since May 30. Currently, Beijing’s 98 nucleic acid testing institutions can process 90,000 tests a day, which has met the needs for testing in the capital, city health commission spokesperson Gao Xiaojun said at a press conference. The reopening of elementary schools, which was scheduled for Monday, has been postponed. Earlier, China’s National Health Commission (NHC) said that 18 new confirmed coronavirus cases were reported in the country on Friday, including six domestically-transmitted cases in Beijing. Also on Friday, seven new asymptomatic cases were reported, taking the total number of such people in quarantine to 98, it said. As of Friday, the overall confirmed cases in China had reached 83,075, including 74 patients who were still being treated, with no one in severe condition. In all, 78,367 people have been discharged after recovery and 4,634 people have died of Covid-19, NHC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-to-implement-wartime-measures-as-46-people-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-NeLJZFChLsFYgvFwHWnIiJ.html
13-06-2020||World||Clashes mar London protests near covered Gandhi, Churchill statues||Thousands of people described as members of right wing groups gathered to support Winston Churchill’s statue in Parliament Square, sang the national anthem, and clashed with the police as most supporters of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) campaign stayed away to avoid confrontation. Flares and bottles were hurled at the police in the square where the statues of Churchill, Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela were boarded up. The BLM campaigners remained in Hyde Park and later dispersed, with plans to protest later in the week.As footage emerged of clashes with the police, home secretary Priti Patel tweeted: “Thoroughly unacceptable thuggery. Any perpetrators of violence or vandalism should expect to face the full force of the law. Violence towards our police officers will not be tolerated”.“Coronavirus remains a threat to us all. Go home to stop the spread of this virus & save lives”, she added, as reports came from protests from Bristol, Brighton and other towns across the UK.In Leicester, some councillors, residents and former MP Keith Vaz formed a cordon around Gandhi’s statue, while an online petition calling for the statue’s removal was closed after it enlisted over 6,000 signatures. The local council will be considering the petition as part of a wider review of public spaces.Descendants of Churchill and those instrumental in setting up Gandhi’s statue in London in 2015 regretted that their statues needed to be protected, with Patel and others calling for the protective boards to be removed soon.According to London mayor Sadiq Khan, his office had intelligence that far-right groups were planning protests with potential of violence, and attack Mandela’s statue. The Greater London Authority under him is responsible for the statues in Parliament Square.Meghnad Desai, chairman of the Gandhi Memorial Statue Trust, said: “It is a pity and a shame that the Gandhi statue in Parliament Square is to be covered up ahead of the BLM rally today. Gandhi has nothing to hide. He is a pioneer of the struggle against imperialism and racism who inspired Martin Luther King and Nelson Mandela”.Gandhi and Churchill statues were among those attacked by BLM protestors last Sunday.Nicholas Soames, Churchill’s grandson and former Conservative minister, said he was “deeply upset” at the statue being covered, adding that British society, according to him, has “lost its moral compass”.He said: “I find it extraordinary that millions and millions of people all over the world who look up to Britain will be astonished that a statue of Churchill and the Cenotaph, our national war memorial, could have been defaced in this disgusting way.”Emma Soames, Churchill’s grand-daughter, wants the statue to be placed in a museum: “It’s extraordinarily sad that my grandfather, who was such a unifying figure in this country, appears to have become a sort of icon through being controversial.”“I think on the whole, people weren’t looking at the entire record of people when they put up statues for them, and even if they did we’d be living in a country of empty plinths I think”, she said, adding that the sight of her grandfather boarded up was “shocking”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-mar-london-protests-near-covered-gandhi-churchill-statues/story-JAVVfUIKZC0zLpYGoeIMiL.html

The agreement with AstraZeneca also aims to make the vaccine available to other European countries that wish to take part.The cost is expected to be offset by funding from the governments.“This agreement will ensure that hundreds of millions of Europeans have access to Oxford University’s vaccine following approval,’’ AstraZeneca CEO Pascal Soriot said. “With our European supply chain due to begin production soon, we hope to make the vaccine available widely and rapidly.’‘The agreement is the latest in a series to make the vaccine — even though it is not certain it will work. But so desperate is the need that scaling up of manufacturing continues despite the risk.The Anglo-Swedish company recently completed similar agreements with Britain, the United States the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, and Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance for 700 million doses. A license also has been agreed with the Serum Institute of India for another 1 billion doses.The vaccine was developed by Oxford University’s Jenner Institute, working with the Oxford Vaccine Group.Testing of the experimental Covid-19 vaccine began in healthy volunteers in Britain in April with over 1,000 people aged 18 to 55. Another round with 10,000 volunteers began last month.Other companies, including Moderna and Sanofi, are racing to develop and produce a vaccine against the new coronavirus, a step experts say will be crucial to allowing countries to ease their lockdowns and restrictions on public life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-agrees-to-make-covid-19-vaccine-for-europe/story-vei9QOxxC1bypZHU8CkOqJ.html
13-06-2020||World||Reseachers in Thailand testing horseshoe bats for coronavirus||Researchers in Thailand began collecting samples from horseshoe bats to test them for coronavirus amid concerns they may pose a threat to local residents, a government statement said on Saturday.They plan to collect 300 bats over three days from a cave in the Chanthaburi province in the southeast of the country. The bats will be released following the tests. Thailand has 23 species of the horseshoe bat, but there has not been an investigation before.The source of the virus remains a matter of debate after it emerged in China late last year.The World Health Organization (WHO) in April said that all available evidence suggests that it originated in bats in China, but it was not clear how the virus had jumped the species barrier to humans. The research team in Thailand includes Supaporn Wacharapluesadee, who identified the country’s first case of Covid-19 in January. “The reason we need to investigate the horseshoe bat is because there are reports from China that the Covid-19 virus is similar to the virus found in the horseshoe bat,” Supaporn said.Thailand was the first country outside China to record a case of the virus. It has so far reported 3,134 cases and 58 deaths. Researchers from the National Parks Department, Chulalongkorn Hospital and Kasetsart University entered the cave on Thursday evening and re-emerged in the early hours of Friday with samples of bat blood, saliva and feces.Investigators were concerned that villagers in the area could be at risk of infection. Locals have been known to eat bats, Supaporn said, adding adequate education and information programs were needed. Local transmissions have waned in recent weeks with new cases coming from Thais returning from overseas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/reseachers-in-thailand-testing-horseshoe-bats-for-coronavirus/story-foR44oLRemAwLb8w5639nN.html

On Thursday, Shehbaz Sharif, chief of the Opposition Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N), tested positive for the coronavirus after he appeared before the NAB in a money laundering case. Gilani’s son Kasim Gilani announced on Twitter that the former premier had tested positive for the coronavirus.“Thank you Imran Khan’s govt and National Accountability Bureau! You have successfully put my father’s life in danger. His COVID-19 result came positive,” Kasim said.Former Pakistan captain Shahid Afridi also tested positive for the coronavirus on Saturday. Pakistan’s Covid-19 cases reached 132,405 after a record 6,472 new infections were detected, while 88 more people have succumbed to the coronavirus, pushing the death toll to 2,551, the health ministry said on Saturday.The Ministry of National Health Services said a record 29,850 tests were done in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of Covid-19 tests conducted in the country to 839,019.“So far, 50,056 people have recovered across Pakistan, making it a significant count,” it said.There are no patients on ventilators in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir and Balochistan. As many as 420 ventilators out of a total 1,400 breathing devices allocated for COVID-19 are occupied across Pakistan, it said.Out of the total 132,405 cases detected so far, Punjab has recorded 50,087. A total of 49,256 infections have been reported in Sindh, 16,415 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 7,866 in Balochistan, 7,163 in Islamabad, 1,044 in Gilgit-Baltistan and 574 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.At least 88 people have died in the last 24 hours, taking the total death toll to 2,551, the ministry said.There are 820 hospitals with Covid-19 facilities in the country and 8,559 patients are admitted across the country, while others are recuperating in self-isolation at homes, it added.The government closed down nearly 1,300 hot spots, including several areas in capital Islamabad, on Saturday due to fast spreading of the deadly virus. “Total 1,292 smart lockdowns enforce throughout the country,” National Command and Operation Center (NCOC) said.It said that the federal and provincial authorities were ensuring compliance with health guidelines and instructions for the working places and following track, test and quarantine strategy.

13-06-2020||World||Wearing face masks best way to stop airborne spread of Covid-19, says study||Wearing face masks in public is the most effective method to prevent person-to-person spread of the coronavirus, a new study says, adding that it is the only way to prevent airborne transmission of the virus.Comparing data from the first pandemic epicentre in Wuhan in central China, Italy and New York city, the researchers argue that non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) like social distancing, quarantine and contact tracing work the best when people wear masks.“This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9,” the researchers from Texas A&M University, the University of Texas, the California Institute of Technology and University of California wrote in the paper.It said both the WHO and the US Centres for Disease Control “largely ignored the importance of airborne transmission route” of the disease even though both emphasised the prevention of contact transmission.It was only last week that the WHO changed its advice on face masks, saying they should be worn in public where social distancing is not possible.It said new information showed masks could provide “a barrier for potentially infectious droplets” -- a validation of this research paper.The organisation had earlier said there was not enough evidence to say that healthy people should wear masks.The WHO DG Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on June 6 that “…in light of evolving evidence, the WHO advises that governments should encourage the general public to wear masks where there is widespread transmission and physical distancing is difficult, such as on public transport, in shops or in other confined or crowded environments”.The new study therefore is particularly relevant to India because wearing a mask is the most inexpensive yet effective way to prevent human-to-human transmission of the virus, if the findings of the study are to be believed.The paper says that government-mandated wearing of masks helped China in flattening the pandemic curve even as the numbers rise globally.“In contrast to China, wearing face masks was not mandated and was unpopular in most of the western world during the early outbreak of the pandemic. Advice on the use of face masks was not issued until April 6 by the WHO,” writes one of the authors Renyi Zhang from the department of atmospheric sciences, Texas A&M University.The peer-reviewed paper was published on June 11 in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS) USA journal: “…analysis reveals that the difference with and without mandated face covering represents the determinant in shaping the trends of the pandemic. This protective measure significantly reduces the number of infections. Other mitigation measures, such as social distancing implemented in the US, are insufficient by themselves in protecting the public.”Why is wearing a mask critical to combating the pandemic?Renyi Zhang explained that face covering prevents both airborne transmission and contact transmission.“On the other hand, social distancing, quarantine, and isolation, in conjunction with hand sanitising, minimise contact (direct and indirect) transmission but do not protect against airborne transmission. With social distancing, quarantine, and isolation in place worldwide and in the US since the beginning of April, airborne transmission represents the only viable route for spreading the disease, when mandated face covering is not implemented.”“We conclude that wearing of face masks in public corresponds to the most effective means to prevent interhuman transmission, and this inexpensive practice, in conjunction with extensive testing, quarantine, and contact tracking, poses the most probable fighting opportunity to stop the Covid-19 pandemic, prior to the development of a vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wearing-face-masks-best-way-to-stop-airborne-spread-of-covid-19-says-study/story-izwqQrCWgEPFoXtuH2ai6N.html

13-06-2020||World||UK’s Priti Patel condemns covering Churchill statue before protests||U.K. Home Secretary Priti Patel has condemned the boarding up of key public statues in London ahead of anti-racism protests on Saturday and urged demonstrators to stay at home.Patel used an interview with the Daily Mail to accuse the city’s mayor, Sadiq Khan, of mishandling the few subversive protesters and called for the statue of former Prime Minister Winston Churchill to be uncovered. On Twitter Patel joined Prime Minister Boris Johnson in warning protesters they risked spreading the coronavirus.Some of the U.K.’s Black Lives Matter groups have said they will no longer attend the protests after reports that right-wing groups planned to descend on the capital to protect statues they see as possible targets for demonstrators. Authorities ordered historic statues of figures ranging from wartime leader Churchill to Nelson Mandela to be boarded up to protect against vandalism.Concern about statues of historic figures who may have racist pasts was heightened after protesters in the city of Bristol last weekend toppled the statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston and dumped it into the harbor there.London Mayor Khan has given his backing to the Black Lives Matter movement but also urged protesters to keep off the streets.Policing of Saturday’s protests is likely to be a contentious issue with a breakdown in relations between enforcement officers and the home secretary, the Times newspaper reported. Patel has come under criticism from police chiefs accused of “disgraceful” interference after she demanded a clamp down on the Black Lives Matter protests, the newspaper reported.Police reportedly took offense after Patel called out officers in Bristol for not intervening when protesters pulled down the statue on June 8. She has made clear she expects the perpetrators to face criminal charges, the paper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-priti-patel-condemns-covering-churchill-statue-before-protests/story-R22PAfI7SUwEyBMWShLz7K.html

13-06-2020||World||In this chaotic time, find strength and peace in Bhagavad Gita: Tulsi Gabbard||America’s first-ever Hindu lawmaker Tulsi Gabbard has said that in this chaotic time, one can find certainty, strength and peace in Bhagavad Gita. In her message during a virtual commencement address, the 39-year-old Congresswoman from Hawaii said that it is a chaotic time and no one can say with certainty what tomorrow looks like. “… but we find certainty, strength and peace in the practice of Bhakti Yoga and Karma Yoga taught to us by Krishna in the Bhagavad Gita,” Gabbard told the ‘Class of 2020 for Hindu students’. Her address came amidst protests in the US against the killing of African-American George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis. The country has been swept by protests since Floyd’s custodial death on May 25 with thousands of people mounting pressure for changes to the law enforcement practices. The first-ever virtual Hindu commencement was organised by the Hindu Students Council on June 7, which drew thousands of viewers on Facebook and YouTube Live, all coming together in solidarity during the ongoing COVID-19 crisis. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 76,00,000 people and killed more than 4,25,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 2.04 million cases and more than 1,14,000 deaths. The COVID-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment. Hundreds of graduates from the US, Canada, the UK, India and Australia attended to commemorate their graduation in a unique way - by celebrating their shared Hindu values. Professor Subhash Kak served as the ceremony’s Grand Marshall. “As you think about this new chapter in your lives, ask yourself what is my purpose in life? It is a deep question that if you can recognise now that your purpose is to serve God and God’s children, practicing Karma Yoga, then you can lead a truly successful life,” Gabbard said. “Success is not defined by temporary material things, trinkets, glittery objects or accomplishments - but a deeply successful and happy life centered around service,” she added. The Iraq war veteran ended her presidential campaign in March and offered her full support to former vice president Joe Biden, 77, who is all set to challenge Republican incumbent Donald Trump, 73, in November elections. The commencement address focused heavily on themes from the Bhagavad Gita, a timeless historical text that many Hindus consider their moral framework. Professor Kak, Regent Professor at Oklahoma State University and 2019 Padma Shri recipient, read out the names of the graduating students. “I exhort you - the graduating students - to be the leaders of the new world where education is less of the mind of a vessel to be filled with information (usually forgotten after the semester is over), and more of a flame that is lit as envisioned by our Vedic sages,” he said. The student speakers were from many university campuses, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Princeton and Stanford. The programme included offerings of Hindu prayers, recitation of a traditional graduation message from the Upanishads and a symbolic conferral of degrees to high school and college graduate. Founded in 1990, Hindu Students Council is North America’s largest pan-Hindu youth organisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-this-chaotic-time-find-strength-and-peace-in-bhagavad-gita-tulsi-gabbard/story-FocgWtD3vprQyCgVmVtRGL.html
13-06-2020||World||Moderna’s mouse study finds one dose of Covid-19 vaccine may provide protection against virus||According to preliminary data released on Friday, a series of studies in mice of Moderna Inc’s Covid-19 lent some assurance that it may not increase the risk of more severe disease. The findings also showed that one dose may provide protection against the novel coronavirus. Prior studies on a vaccine for SARS - a close cousin to the new virus that causes Covid-19 - suggests vaccines against this type of virus might have the unintended effect of causing more severe disease when the vaccinated person is later exposed to the pathogen, especially in individuals who do not produce an adequately strong immune response.

13-06-2020||World||Slight Covid-19 spikes may get out of control amid US reopening, says Fauci||The top US infectious disease official on Friday cautioned that the “blips” of rising coronavirus hospitalizations being reported by some states could get out of control if robust contact tracing regimes are not put in place. As restrictions on economic activity are lifted, the United States was bound to see increased infections, Anthony Fauci told CNN. “But when you start seeing more hospitalizations, that’s a sure fire sign that you’re in a situation where you’re going in the wrong direction,” Fauci said. So far, more than 114,000 people have died from COVID-19 in the United States, according to a Reuters tally. About half a dozen US states are grappling with a rising number of coronavirus patients filling hospital beds. Texas and North Carolina on Friday reported their highest hospitalization rates since the pandemic began. But officials in both states point out they also have among the lowest rates of deaths from COVID-19.Fauci underscored that increased hospitalizations was a worrying trend, however, and a sign that “maybe we need to slow down a little” on reopenings. North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper said on Friday that while his state’s rise in hospitalizations and new cases was sobering, moving ahead with more reopenings was not off the table. Texas has been at the forefront of states’ efforts to reopen their economies and Governor Greg Abbott on Friday said in an interview with KYTX TV it would remain that way “because we have so many hospital beds available to anybody who gets ill.” “For every person in a hospital bed, there are 10 open, available hospital beds available for them,” Abbott said. “So there’s plenty of hospital capacity to be able to deal with Covid-19.”He added that there is “no real need to ratchet back the opening of businesses in the state.”A handful of states and cities have paused or slowed reopenings.Oregon Governor Kate Brown said she would put county applications to reopen on hold after the state reported a record daily rise in new coronavirus cases on Thursday.“This is essentially a statewide ‘yellow light,’ it’s time to press pause for one week before any further reopening,” Brown, a Democrat, said in a statement.Utah’s Republican Governor Gary Herbert on Friday ordered most of the state to halt reopening while it investigated a jump in cases.“I don’t want to go forward and then take a step backward,” Herbert said of the order that remains in effect until June 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/slight-covid-19-spikes-may-get-out-of-control-amid-us-reopening-says-fauci/story-dMCFGJGxltrL4WZ5M7YqDN.html

13-06-2020||World||India repatriates 227 stranded citizens from Finland, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia||As many as 227 Indian nationals stranded in Finland, Denmark, Estonia and Latvia have been flown back home under the third phase of the mega evacuation exercise Vande Bharat. National carrier Air India on Friday evening operated its first passenger flight ever from the Finnish capital city Helsinki, bringing back the Indian citizens stranded in the four European countries due to the international travel restrictions following the coronavirus outbreak.Air India’s Country Manager in Israel, Pankaj Tiwari, whose office coordinated the repatriation flight told PTI that the AI 1184 flight landed in New Delhi on Saturday.“The repatriation provided immense relief to stranded Indians, especially those who had come to Finland as tourists, business travellers, senior citizens who had been visiting their children and students who finished their academic year,” India’s Ambassador to Finland Vani Rao told PTI.“Among them were a couple who came to Finland for their honeymoon and got stuck for three months. Several are returning to India for medical attention and family emergencies,” Rao added. While most of the stranded passengers were from Finland, 15 were from Estonia, some from Denmark and one from Latvia. The Air India flight also brought to Finland 168 people, including 15 infants, who were stranded in India.The special flight was a massive effort and a challenging one because Air India does not have any operations in Finland and all the logistics and ground support had to be handled by the concerned Finnish operators and was managed remotely by the Air India office in Tel Aviv, Rao said. “This operation was very special as it was the first ever passenger flight from Finland to India by Air India. Another first was the scale at which thermal screening was carried out at the Helsinki airport -- in the last 15 years a thermal screening operation of so many passengers was not done in Helsinki on a single day,” she said.The Finnish government, especially the foreign ministry, the border police and the airport management company, Finnavia, extended their cooperation and support to the inbound and outbound flights in coordination with the Indian embassy and the Air India office in Tel Aviv.The Indian community in Finland also came forward to volunteer in the efforts.“While the mission was extremely challenging and needed coordination on several fronts, the happiness of the stranded Indians and their relief at finally heading back home made it completely worthwhile. For the embassy and the Indian community, an Air India flight landing at Helsinki was a moment of pride and a very memorable one,” Rao said.Some Indians in Finland and Estonia who could not be accommodated on the flight, and are keen to go back to India, have been advised to take the Vande Bharat Flights from Frankfurt and Paris through direct booking. “Handling operations at an offline location is challenging, but with the excellent support from the team of Embassy officials, local authorities in Finland and the Air India Team it was a seamless experience,” Tiwari said.The third phase of the Vande Bharat Mission got underway on Thursday and will continue till July 2. Phase-III will have 432 international flights from 43 countries reaching 17 states and union territories. A total of 1,65,375 Indians have returned from abroad till Thursday under the evacuation mission, the first phase of which was launched on May 7.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-repatriates-227-stranded-citizens-from-finland-denmark-estonia-and-latvia/story-ZgXwvQ6S3vdEWPZ4ndSEOJ.html
13-06-2020||World||Up to 45% of Covid-19 infections may be asymptomatic: Study||As much as 45 per cent of people infected by the novel coronavirus behind the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic never show symptoms of the disease, according to a review of studies which suggests that the virus may silently damage the bodies of these asymptotic individuals. Scientists, including Eric Topol from the Scripps Research Translational Institute in the US, analysed public datasets on asymptomatic infections of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. The findings, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, suggested that asymptomatic people may account for approximately 40 to 45 per cent of SARS-CoV-2 infections, playing a significant role in the spread of the disease. Based on the study, the scientists highlighted the need for expansive testing and contact tracing of infected individuals to mitigate the pandemic. “The silent spread of the virus makes it all the more challenging to control,” said Topol, founder and director of the Scripps Research Translational Institute and professor of Molecular Medicine at Scripps Research. “Our review really highlights the importance of testing. It’s clear that with such a high asymptomatic rate, we need to cast a very wide net, otherwise the virus will continue to evade us,” he added. In the study, Topol and his team collected information from testing studies on 16 diverse cohorts from around the world. The scientists noted in a statement that these datasets were gathered via keyword searches of PubMed, bioRxiv and medRxiv, as well as Google searches of relevant news reports. They said the analysis included data on nursing home residents, cruise ship passengers, prison inmates and various other groups. “What virtually all of them had in common was that a very large proportion of infected individuals had no symptoms,” said Daniel Oran, another co-author of the study. “Among more than 3,000 prison inmates in four states who tested positive for the coronavirus, the figure was astronomical -- 96 percent asymptomatic,” Oran said. According to the review research, asymptomatic individuals are able to transmit the virus for an extended period of time, perhaps longer than 14 days. The scientists noted that the viral loads are very similar in people with or without symptoms, but it remains unclear whether their infectiousness is of the same magnitude. To resolve that issue, they said, large-scale studies that include sufficient numbers of asymptomatic people are needed. The absence of symptoms may not imply an absence of harm, the researchers concluded. Citing an example, they said CT scans conducted on asymptomatic individuals on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, appeared to show significant lung abnormalities, raising the possibility of the virus silently impacting lung function. “Although the latter infected persons reported no symptoms, some actually had subclinical changes in their lungs. When computed tomography scans for 76 of these persons were examined, 54 per cent showed lung opacities,” the researchers wrote in the study. The scientists believe that further research is needed to confirm the potential significance of this finding. They said the lack of longitudinal data makes distinguishing between asymptomatic and presymptomatic individuals difficult. An asymptomatic individual, the researchers said, is someone who is infected with SARS-CoV-2, but never develops symptoms of Covid-19, while a presymptomatic person is similarly infected, but will eventually develop symptoms. According to the scientists, longitudinal testing, which refers to repeated testing of individuals over time, would help differentiate between the two.“Our estimate of 40 to 45 percent asymptomatic means that, if you’re unlucky enough to get infected, the probability is almost a flip of a coin on whether you’re going to have symptoms,” Oran said. “So to protect others, we think that wearing a mask makes a lot of sense,” he concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/up-to-45-of-covid-19-infections-may-be-asymptomatic-study/story-TxRqU6PTBh6I6ivqecQdSJ.html

The study, published in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine, suggests that an extraordinary percentage of people infected by the ongoing deadly Covid-19 pandemic never showed symptoms of the disease.The report highlights the need for expansive testing and contacts tracing to mitigate the pandemic.“The silent spread of the virus makes it all the more challenging to control,” said study researcher Eric Topol from the Scripps Research Translational Institute in the US.“Our review really highlights the importance of testing.

13-06-2020||World||Nepal Parliament set to vote on new map which covers Indian territory||Nepal Parliament’s special session began on Saturday to discuss a key Constitution amendment bill tabled by the government to revise the country’s political map, laying claim over the strategically key areas of Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura along the border with India.The House of Representatives opened the discussion on the amendment bill which will be put for voting after the deliberations are over, said spokesman at the Parliament Rojnath Pandey.He said the House has been working to put the bill to vote on Saturday.Endorsement of the bill is certain as the Opposition Nepali Congress and Janata Samajwadi Party-Nepal have vowed to back for the government bill to amend Schedule 3 of the constitution to update the national emblem by incorporating the new map, sources said. The bill will be endorsed through a consensus, a senior minister told PTI.Two-thirds majority of the 275-member Lower House is required to pass the bill. Once the bill is passed by the Lower House, it will be sent to the National Assembly where it will undergo a similar process. The NA will have to give lawmakers 72 hours to move amendments against the bill’s provisions, if any. After the National Assembly passes the bill, it will be submitted to the President for authentication, after which the bill will be incorporated in the Constitution. On June 9, the Parliament unanimously endorsed a proposal to consider the bill to pave way for endorsing the new map. The government on Wednesday formed a nine-member team of experts to collect historical facts and evidence related to the area. Diplomats and experts, however, questioned the government’s move, asking why the task force was formed when the map has already been released and approved by the Cabinet. The ties between India and Nepal came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8. Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory. Nepal last month released the revised political and administrative map of the country laying claim over the strategically key areas. India has been maintaining that these three areas belonged to it. India sternly asked Nepal not to resort to any “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims after Kathmandu released the new map. Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli earlier this month said that his government will seek a solution to the Kalapani issue through diplomatic efforts and dialogue on the basis of historical facts and documents. “We will get back the land occupied by India through holding a dialogue,” Oli said while responding to questions in Parliament on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-parliament-s-session-begins-likely-to-pass-bill-to-redraw-political-map/story-bBV3pdZaQMIcxma1nN8AHM.html

13-06-2020||World||‘Covid-19 virus may have mutated to become more infectious and stable’: Study||A latest study by experts at the Scripps Research Institute in Florida, US, states that the new coronavirus may have mutated, therefore more infectious. The study which was published by the institute on Friday states, “Covid-19-causing viral variant taking over in the United States and Europe now carries more functional, cell-binding spikes.”Laboratory experiments performed at the institute revealed that a tiny genetic mutation in the SARS coronavirus 2 variant circulating throughout Europe and the United States significantly increases the virus’ ability to infect cells.“Viruses with this mutation were much more infectious than those without the mutation in the cell culture system we used,” Scripps Research virologist Hyeryun Choe, PhD and senior author of the study said.ALSO WATCH | AIIMS director explains why Covid deaths are more important than casesAlso read: Existing polio vaccine shows promise, could protect against Covid-19’There has been much debate about why Covid-19 outbreaks in some parts of the world quickly overwhelmed health systems, while at other locations the outbreak could be readily managed.“Was it something about those communities and their response, or had the virus somehow changed?” The study explained how all viruses mutate and change to some degree but those changes “rarely impact fitness or ability to compete”. The significant change with respect to SARS-CoV-2 variant was the presence of D614G mutation which was absent in the earliest regional outbreaks. Also read: Top 2 coronavirus-hit countries are nearly 12 lakh cases apartThe experts, however, have called for more research, concluding that the Covid-19 virus may have ultimately figured out how to be more stable and not fall apart. “Over time, it has figured out how to hold on better and not fall apart until it needs to,” co-author Michael Farzan, PhD, co-chairman of the Scripps Research Department of Immunology and Microbiology said. “The virus has, under selection pressure, made itself more stable,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-virus-may-have-mutated-to-beccome-more-infectious-and-stable-study/story-0CBBqU5mTrSoxuyBT0PJUI.html

13-06-2020||World||India’s presence in UNSC will help bring its ethos of ‘world is one family’||India’s presence in the United Nations Security Council will help bring to the world its ethos of ‘Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam’, the country’s envoy to the global body has said, ahead of elections for the non-permanent seat of the powerful UN organ. India is all set to join the UN Security Council as a non-permanent member, elections for which will be held on June 17.India is a candidate for a non-permanent seat from the Asia-Pacific category for the 2021-22 term. Its victory is a given since it is the sole candidate vying for the lone seat from the grouping. New Delhi’s candidature was unanimously endorsed by the 55-member Asia-Pacific grouping, including China and Pakistan, in June last year. India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti, in a video message on Friday, underscored that the United Nations as well as the multilateralism need to change to reflect the contemporary realities and remain credible as the world organisation marks its 75th anniversary this year. “India’s journey with the United Nations is quite a remarkable one. As a founding member of the United Nations, India’s contribution to implementing the goals of the United Nations Charter and to the evolution of UN specialised agencies and programmes has been substantial. In many ways, quite extraordinary,” he said. “I’m confident that at a time when we are poised to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the United Nations and later the 75th anniversary of India’s independence in 2022, India’s presence in the Security Council will help bring to the world our ethos that the world is one family - Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam,” Tirumurti said. Ahead of the elections, External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar has outlined New Delhi’s priorities for its candidature. India’s focus will be on the ‘New Orientation For A Reformed Multilateral System’ (NORMS). India’s priorities include new opportunities for progress, effective response to the international terrorism, reforming multilateral systems, comprehensive approach to peace and security and technology with a human touch. Tirumurti said as the UN commemorates its 75th anniversary this year, “it is clear to us that the United Nations and indeed multilateralism itself need to change to reflect the contemporary realities to enable them to remain effective and credible.” The envoy referred to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for a reformed multilateralism and multilateral system as essential to ensure that the international system is inclusive and caters to the requirements of all countries, which will in turn facilitate stronger actions. “We also believe that the current crisis that we face, especially in the context of the Covid-19, provide the seed for new opportunities,” Tirumurti said. Previously, India has been elected as a non-permanent member of the Security Council for the years 1950-1951, 1967-1968, 1972-1973, 1977-1978, 1984-1985, 1991-1992 and most recently in 2011-2012. India has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the Security Council, saying it rightly deserves a place as a permanent member of the UNSC, which in its current form does not represent the geo-political realities of the 21st century. The video message outlined India’s role and contribution to the UN over the decades, including its leadership role in the UN peacekeeping, launch of the India Human Development Partnership Fund, Modi’s call to commemorate International Yoga Day and India’s gift of the Gandhi Solar Park installed on the roof of the UN headquarters. It also highlighted the pioneering men and women from India whose contribution helped shape the world organisation. They include Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar, the first president of the UN Economic and Social Council ECOSOC in 1946; reformer and educator Hansa Mehta, India’s delegate to the UN Commission on Human Rights from 1947 to 1948, who is widely credited with making a significant change in the language of Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by replacing the phrase “All men are born free and equal” to “All human beings are born free and equal”. Lakshmi Menon was India’s delegate to the Third Committee in 1948 and argued forcefully in the favour of non-discrimination based on sex and Vijaya Lakshmi Pandit who was the first woman to be elected as the President of the General Assembly in 1953. “Independent India deemed its membership of the United Nations as an important guarantee for maintaining peace and security. We stood at the forefront, not just in the United Nations but outside it as well during the years of struggle against colonialism and apartheid,” Tirumurti added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-s-presence-in-unsc-will-help-bring-its-ethos-of-world-is-one-family/story-UujLcBefutSGVMAh6cgZuJ.html
13-06-2020||World||‘Stop nonsensical talks about denuclearization’: North Korea slams neighbour||North Korea on Saturday again bashed South Korea, telling its rival to stop “nonsensical” talk about its denuclearization and vowing to expand its military capabilities.The statement by senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official Kwon Jong Gun came after South Korea’s Foreign Ministry told reporters that Seoul will continue to work toward improving bilateral relations and reviving nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington.The government of South Korean President Moon Jae-in had lobbied hard to set up nuclear summits between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and President Donald Trump, who have met three times since 2018. At the same time, Moon also worked to improve inter-Korean relations.But North Korea in recent months has suspended virtually all cooperation with the South while expressing frustration over the lack of progress in its nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration.The North over the past week declared it will cut off all government and military communication channels with the South and threatened to abandon inter-Korean peace agreements reached in 2018. It blamed Seoul for failing to stop activists from floating anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border.Seoul’s Foreign Ministry was reacting to a separate North Korean statement late Friday that said the North’s confidence with the South’s government was completely “shattered” and that “regretful and painful times” were ahead for its rival.Kwon, director-general of the Foreign Ministry’s U.S. affairs department, said it was “preposterous to hear the balderdash of (South Korean) authorities, who do not have either any qualification to discuss, or the position to poke their noses into” matters between North Korea and the United States, including nuclear issues. He dismissed South Korea’s role as a mediator between Washington and Pyongyang.“I want to make it clear that we will continue to build up our force in order to overpower the persistent threats from the United States, and such efforts of ours are in fact continuing at this point of time,” Kwon said in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.“We are not what we were two years ago. The change continues and will continue as ever in a tremendous way. It is better to stop a nonsensical talking about denuclearization.”Nuclear talks faltered after the United States rejected North Korean demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of the North’s nuclear capabilities at Kim’s second summit with Trump in Vietnam in February last year.Trump and Kim met for a third time that year in June at the border between North and South Korea and agreed to resume talks. But an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what the North Koreans described as the Americans’ “old stance and attitude.”On the two-year anniversary of the first Kim-Trump meeting on Friday, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon said the North would never again gift Trump with high-profile meetings he could boast as foreign policy achievements unless it gets something substantial in return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-nonsensical-talks-about-denuclearization-north-korea-slams-neighbour/story-DDOA38ZWLn9HsKMcEOV69O.html
13-06-2020||World||Trump shifts date of Oklahoma rally to ‘respect’ emancipation holiday||US President Donald Trump said on Friday he would shift the date of an Oklahoma rally from June 19th, the date of the “Juneteenth” holiday, to June 20th out of respect for a day commemorating the end of US slavery.Amid protests against racial injustice, Trump had faced criticism for scheduling his first campaign rally in months on a day known by African Americans as Freedom Day and in Tulsa, Oklahoma, a city where white mobs massacred African-Americans a century ago.“Many of my African American friends and supporters have reached out to suggest that we consider changing the date out of respect for this Holiday,” Trump tweeted. “I have therefore decided to move our rally to Saturday, June 20th, in order to honor their requests.”Trump, seeking re-election on Nov. 3, scheduled the Tulsa rally on June 19th, the date in 1865 when Texas became the last of the pro-slavery Confederate states forced to comply with President Abraham Lincoln’s Emancipation Proclamation during the Civil War declaring all people held as slaves free.Tulsa, a city important in African-American history, in 1921 was the site of one of the bloodiest outbreaks of racist violence in US history in which white mobs attacked black residents and businesses. Referring to his rally, Trump told Fox News in an interview aired earlier on Friday: “Think about it as a celebration.” The Republican president suspended his political rallies in March due to the coronavirus pandemic. Trump denied that scheduling the Tulsa rally on Juneteenth was deliberate. The rally will take place against a backdrop of protests around the United States against racism and police brutality sparked by the death of George Floyd, a black man who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25 after a white officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes. The officer was fired and has been charged with second-degree murder.Fox News interviewer Harris Faulkner, who is black, later said she was not sure whether Trump was aware of the painful history of Tulsa for African-Americans because her questions in the interview, held on Thursday, focused on the Juneteenth date of the rally.“This isn’t just a wink to white supremacists - he’s throwing them a welcome home party,” US Senator Kamala Harris, a contender to be Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden’s vice presidential pick, wrote on Twitter on Thursday.Trump, who this week rejected calls to rename US military bases named for Confederate military figures, said in the Fox News interview that what Lincoln had done was “questionable,” but was cut off before he could elaborate.“I think I’ve done more for the black community than any other president. And let’s take a pass on Abraham Lincoln ‘cause he did good, although it’s always questionable. You know, in other words the end result,” Trump said without explanation.Faulkner then spoke over him saying: “But we are free, Mr. President. He did pretty well.”“We are free. You understand what I mean. I’m going to take a pass on Abe - Honest Abe as we call him,” Trump responded.Democrats and other critics have accused Trump of stoking racial divisions. The president said during the Floyd protests in which looting occurred in some cities that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Trump told Fox News he was not aware that this phrase originated with a white segregationist who was Miami mayor in the 1960s.On Thursday, the Republican Party scheduled Trump’s speech to formally accept its presidential nomination for Aug. 27 in Jacksonville, Florida. That day will mark the 60th anniversary of what is called “Ax Handle Saturday,” when a white mob wielding ax handles began a riot over black youth attempting to order food from a whites-only lunch counter in Jacksonville.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-shifts-date-of-oklahoma-rally-to-respect-emancipation-holiday/story-NsqBnl80ss58vp0XhSK0yJ.html
13-06-2020||World||Pakistan forms joint investigation team to probe PIA plane crash||The Pakistan government has formed a joint investigation team to probe the last month’s plane crash in Karachi that killed 98 people.The joint investigation team (JIT) was constituted on Friday, comprising officials of the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA), to probe into the Pakistan International Ailrlines (PIA) plane crash. “The three-member JIT headed by FIA Immigration Lahore Additional Director Imran Yaqoob, is tasked to finalise the matter on top priority and submit the report to the government at the earliest,” an FIA official told PTI. The official said the JIT has been constituted in compliance with the Senate Committee on Interior that had taken notice of the plane crash and asked the government to constitute a high-power committee.A four-member team of the Aircraft Accident and Investigation Board (AAIB) led by Air Commodore Muhammad Usman Ghani has already been investigating the crash.Besides, a French team also visited Pakistan to conduct an independent probe and collected evidence from the crash site as well as inspected the runway.The Pakistan government has said it will make the preliminary report of the AAIB team public on June 22.The PIA plane, with 99 people on board, crashed in the Model Colony near Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on May 22, killing 97 people. Two passengers miraculously survived.A 13-year-old girl who was injured on the ground later succumbed to her injuries, taking the death toll in the incident to 98.The Senate Committee had recommended that the FIA Lahore should examine if the engineering branch of PIA at Lahore was being maintained as per the given international standards and how many times the small components of aircraft had been made/repaired from local companies /workshops.The Committee said it was felt that the maintenance system of aircraft had been deteriorating day by day and becoming irresponsible which was visibly noted over the past few tragic incidents. “All aircraft of PIA should be retested, overhauled and the maintenance must be done by PIA and the certificates with responsibility be given before bringing the aircraft on the runway to avoid such incidents in future, following internationally acknowledged air safety rules to make Pakistani airspace safest for flying,” it said.It also called for detailed record of the maintenance of the crashed aircraft, an Airbus A-320.“It is reported that error was being shown on the cockpit of the plane. Who was the authorised officer to sign the clearance certificate of the said plane? Was the clearance certificate also signed by the Captain? This plane remained under dry lease to China and what was its condition when this plane was received back from China?” the Senate Committee on Interior questioned.It further said that Capitan Sajjad Gul made three Mayday calls requesting the ground staff that there was an error in the plane but his three emergency calls for emergency response could not convince the ground staff to response on his first call. “Who was the staff member on the ground who declared the said emergency call as light one?” It said that one could visibly see that both engines of the plane were on fire. While the plane successfully reached Karachi, the shutting of both engines of the plane was reported by the pilot. If the engines were shut, how did the engines catch fire? The committee questioned that if the captain had shown the apprehension that both engines were shut and landing gear was stuck then why he was not allowed immediately on his first call with belly landing if the belly-landing facility was available at Karachi Airport?

13-06-2020||World||Five dead in latest flooding in southern China rainstorms||Rainstorms have killed five more people in a southern Chinese region already reeling from heavy flooding over the past week.The government of Zunyi city, south of the metropolis of Chongqing, said Saturday that five had died and eight others were missing after fresh storms that began late Thursday night.A statement on its website said at least 13,000 people had been evacuated, more than 2,000 homes damaged and multiple sections of roads and three bridges destroyed in the city in Guizhou province.Earlier storms left 13 dead in nearby Hunan province and the Guangxi region.Seasonal flooding regularly strikes the lower regions of China’s major river systems, particularly those of the Yangtze and the Pearl to the south.More than 200,000 people have been forced to seek shelter and economic losses are estimated at more than $500 million, the Ministry of Emergency Management said earlier this week.Guangxi’s crucial tourism sector, already hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, has been set back further by the floods. The region is home to the city of Guilin, famous for its landscape of karst rock formations.Authorities have sought to mitigate flooding through the construction of dams, such as the massive Three Gorges structure on the Yangtze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-dead-in-latest-flooding-in-southern-china-rainstorms/story-Gtk8HWXGLdeiRAiskkyBmJ.html
13-06-2020||World||Judge orders Seattle to stop using tear gas during protests||A US judge on Friday ordered Seattle police to temporarily halt using tear gas, pepper spray and flash-bang devices to break up peaceful protests. The city, long known as liberal with a lengthy history of protests, has been taking hits from all sides including protesters, some city officials, the president and now a judge over police response to recent demonstrations.US District Judge Richard Jones issued the two-week order after a Black Lives Matter group sued the Seattle Police Department this week to halt the violent tactics it has used to break up protests.Officers last weekend used tear gas, pepper spray and other force against crowds that were demonstrating following George Floyd’s death at the hands of Minneapolis police.Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan and Police Chief Carmen Best have apologized to peaceful protesters who were subjected to chemical weapons. But Best has said some demonstrators violently targeted police, throwing objects and ignoring orders to disperse. Both have faced calls to resign, which they have rejected.The judge said those objecting to police using violent tactics to break up protests make a strong case that the indiscriminate use of force is unconstitutional. Jones said weapons like tear gas and pepper spray fail to target “any single agitator or criminal” and they are especially problematic during the coronavirus pandemic.“Because they are indiscriminate, they may even spill into bystanders’ homes or offices as they have done before,” Jones wrote.Durkan, a former US attorney, “believes the court struck the right balance to protect the fundamental constitutional right to exercise protest, with the need to also ensure public safety,” spokesperson Kamaria Hightower said in an email.Durkan also has requested reviews of police actions from the Office of Police Accountability and the city’s inspector general.This week, protesters have turned part of Seattle’s Capitol Hill neighborhood into a protest center with speakers, drum circles and Black Lives Matter painted on a street near a police station. Police largely left the station after the chaos last weekend, with officers tear-gassing protesters and some demonstrators throwing objects at them. Police used tear gas just two days after the mayor and police chief said they were temporarily halting its use.Durkan tweeted that she visited the so-called autonomous zone, which has been criticized by President Donald Trump, to speak Friday with organizers about moving forward. She said that for as long as she can remember, Capitol Hill has been a place where people can go to express themselves.Trump has slammed her and Gov. Jay Inslee for not breaking up the occupation by “anarchists” and threatening to take action if they don’t. Both have assailed his comments and say they’re focusing on a peaceful resolution. The demonstrations since police left the area have been calm.Michele Storms, executive director of the ACLU of Washington, said the group was pleased with the judge’s ruling.“The city must allow for freedom of speech and freedom of assembly, and it must address police accountability and excessive use of force,” Storms said in a statement.The ruling came as massive crowds marched in the rain and some businesses temporarily closed in response to a call from Black Lives Matter Seattle-King County to launch a statewide general strike.“As tens of thousands of people were gathering today to march silently and in solidarity against police brutality and misconduct, the US District Court affirmed their right to protest, free from state violence. That is a victory for today,” the group said in a statement.Durkan tweeted Friday afternoon that she and Best participated in the Black Lives Matter march, saying Best and her police department leaders have been working “incredibly hard to adjust and improve every day.”Black Lives Matter had encouraged supporters not go to work or to work from home Friday and to take time to learn about local elected officials and issues. Organizers have demands for the city, county and state, including cutting at least $100 million from the Seattle police budget, ending cash bail and declaring racism a public health crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-orders-seattle-to-stop-using-tear-gas-during-protests/story-nF8rV5UkAiCldxmzYqHtJP.html
13-06-2020||World||Brazil’s biggest cemetery to exhume graves to free up space||Brazil’s biggest metropolis has an unorthodox plan to free up space at its graveyards during the coronavirus pandemic: digging up the bones of people buried in the past and storing their bagged remains in large metal containers.Sao Paulo’s municipal funeral service said in a statement Friday that the remains of people who died at least three years ago will be exhumed and put in numbered bags, then stored temporarily in 12 storage containers it has purchased. The containers will be delivered to several cemeteries within 15 days, the statement said.Sao Paulo is one of the Covid-19 hot spots in Latin America’s hardest-hit nation, with 5,480 deaths as of Thursday in the city of 12 million people. And some health experts are worried about a new surge now that a decline in intensive care bed occupancy to about 70% prompted Mayor Bruno Covas to authorize a partial reopening of business this week. The result has been crowded public transport, long lines at malls and widespread disregard for social distancing.Many health experts predict the peak of Brazil’s pandemic will arrive in August, having spread from the big cities where it first appeared into the nation’s interior. The virus has so far killed almost 42,000 Brazilians, and Brazil passed the United Kingdom on Friday to become the country with the world’s second highest death toll.Dr. Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s emergencies chief, said Friday that the situation in Brazil remains “of concern,” although acknowledged that intensive care bed occupancy rates are now below 80% in most areas of the country.“Overall the health system is still coping in Brazil, although, having said that, with the sustained number of severe cases that remains to be seen,” Ryan said. “Clearly the health system in Brazil across the country needs significant support in order to sustain its effort in this regard. But the data we have at the moment supports a system under pressure, but a system still coping with the number of severe cases.”The experts aren’t the only ones with concerns.At Sao Paulo’s biggest cemetery, Vila Formosa, Adenilson Costa was among workers in blue protective suits digging up old graves Friday. He said their work has only grown more arduous during the pandemic, and as he removed bones from unearthed coffins, he said he fears what is to come.“With this opening of malls and stores we get even more worried. We are not in the curve; we are in the peak and people aren’t aware,” Costa said. “This isn’t over. Now is the worrisome moment. And there are still people out.”In April, gravediggers at Vila Formosa buried 1,654 people, up more than 500 from the previous month. Numbers for May and June aren’t yet available.Before the pandemic, Costa said, he and colleagues would exhume remains of about 40 coffins per day if families stopped paying required fees for the plots. In recent weeks that figure has more than doubled.Remains stored in the metal containers will eventually be moved to a public ossuary, according to the statement from the city’s funeral office. Its superintendent, Thiago Dias da Silva, told the Globo network that containers have been used before and they are more practical and affordable than building new ossuaries.Work has been so busy in Sao Paulo cemeteries since the outbreak began that one of Costa’s relatives was buried only a few meters (yards) from where he was working one day — without him even knowing. “I only found out the next day,” he said.Three other people he knew have also died from the virus.“People say nothing scares gravediggers. Covid does,” Costa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-s-biggest-cemetery-to-exhume-graves-to-free-up-space/story-FoyZZP32mucrgY6qjpHHbN.html
13-06-2020||World||Masks may have prevented thousands of Covid-19 cases: Study||Requiring the wearing of masks to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus in areas at the epicenter of the global pandemic may have prevented tens of thousands of infections, a new study suggests.Mask-wearing is even more important for preventing the virus’ spread and the sometimes deadly Covid-19 illness it causes than social distancing and stay-at-home orders, researchers said, in the study published in PNAS: The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageInfection trends shifted dramatically when mask-wearing rules were implemented on April 6 in northern Italy and April 17 in New York City - at the time among the hardest hit areas of the world by the health crisis - the study found. “This protective measure alone significantly reduced the number of infections, that is, by over 78,000 in Italy from April 6 to May 9 and over 66,000 in New York City from April 17 to May 9,” researchers calculated.When mask-wearing went into effect in New York, the daily new infection rate fell by about 3% per day, researchers said. In the rest of the country, daily new infections continued to increase. Direct contact precautions - social distancing, quarantine and isolation, and hand sanitizing - were all in place before mask-wearing rules went into effect in Italy and New York City. But they only help minimize virus transmission by direct contact, while face covering helps prevent airborne transmission, the researchers say. “The unique function of face covering to block atomization and inhalation of virus-bearing aerosols accounts for the significantly reduced infections,” they said. That would indicate “that airborne transmission of Covid-19 represents the dominant route for infection.”The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday urged organizers of large gatherings that involve “shouting, chanting or singing to strongly encourage the use of cloth face coverings to lower the risk of spreading the coronavirus.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/masks-may-have-prevented-thousands-of-covid-19-cases-study/story-tZshTixGLQppamRNF480RJ.html

People with mild symptoms or no obvious symptoms can unknowingly pass the infection on to other people,” NSW Health said.Two of the four new cases were travellers who are already in hotel quarantine, while one was linked to a previously reported infection at a public school.Australia has so far been successful in curbing the spread of the coronavirus, with many parts of the country claiming to have eliminated the disease already. The country has reported 102 deaths and is on track to fully re-open its economy by next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-largest-state-reports-first-local-coronavirus-case-in-weeks/story-4gZm62EonDuvffn4HJ17CP.html

The Democratic National Convention (DNC) in Wisconsin in August would formally nominate Biden, 77, as the party’s candidate for the November 3 presidential elections.In the presidential elections, Biden will challenge Republican incumbent Donald Trump, 73, who is seeking re-election. On the National Finance Committee for the former vice president, Bhutoria is a prominent national bundler for the Democratic Party. He was elected as a Biden Delegate for the California District 17th National Convention District-Level Caucus this week. The election was held through online ballot. As a strong supporter of Biden, Bhutoria has been instrumental in bringing together the issues of Asian Americans to forefront. He is working with the DNC to have the Democratic Party website translated into Asian American languages. Also on Asian American Pacific Islander Leadership Council for Biden, Bhutoria is bringing together the Asian Americans to vote for him, primarily South Asians. He worked on the National Finance committee for Hillary Clinton’s election in 2016, raising between USD 500 to USD 1 million. Bhutoria has also worked with the Obama-Biden administration on many issues, including free community college initiative around the country.

13-06-2020||World||Police video of aboriginal chief arrest shocking, says Canadian PM Trudeau||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said Friday that black and indigenous people in Canada do not feel safe around police after a police dashcam video emerged of the violent arrest of a Canadian aboriginal chief.The arrest has received attention in Canada as a backlash against racism grows worldwide in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee to his neck.The 12-minute police video shows an officer charging at Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Chief Allan Adam with his arm and elbow up as he tackles him to the ground. It also shows the officer punching him in the head.Trudeau called the video “shocking.” “I have serious questions about what happened,” Trudeau said. “The independent investigation must be transparent and be carried out so that we get answers.At the same time, though, we also know that this is not an isolated incident. Far too many black Canadians and indigenous people do not feel safe around police.It’s unacceptable. And as governments, we have to change that.” Pictures show Adam was left bloodied with his face swollen. Alberta’s police watchdog agency is investigating. Police charged Adam with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer.The Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation said the Royal Canadian Mounted Police dash camera video was released publicly as part of a court application to get criminal charges against Adam removed.The video earlier shows a different officer approaching Adam’s truck outside a casino in Fort McMurray, Alberta, early on the morning of March 10. Police have said Adam’s truck had expired plates.The video shows Adam getting in and out of the vehicle, removing his coat and taking a karate-like stance and using expletives as he complains about being harassed by police. His wife and niece get in between him and the officer at times.Adam’s lawyer, Brian Beresh, has filed a court motion to have criminal charges dropped over violation of Adam’s constitutional rights.“All of this resulted from an expired license plate tag. The video speaks for itself,” Beresh said in a statement.Opposition Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer said he was troubled by the video.“It’s very difficult to watch,” Scheer said. “I found it very troubling and very worrying. The events of the last few days and weeks have ignited a very important conversation about the use of excessive force.” The RCMP said in a statement that the dashcam video had been reviewed by supervisors and “it was determined that the members’ actions were reasonable and did not meet the threshold for an external investigation.” Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland said she found the images in the video “incredibly disturbing.” “This is a moment in our country when we need to confront the really horrible reality that systemic racism exists here in Canada, anti-black racism exists in Canada, anti-indigenous racism exists in Canada. It is systemic,” she said.The statement from the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation called for the officers involved to be punished and criminal charges brought.Mark Mendelson, a former Toronto police detective, said the officer flying at Adam with his elbow and punching him on the ground was unnecessary and egregious. Mendelson also wondered why he was being arrested.“You can see him being verbally aggressive. My position is that if you can’t take somebody yelling and swearing and screaming at you, then you probably shouldn’t be a cop,” he said.Adam held a news conference last weekend to talk about excessive force and racism. He has noted that although aboriginal people represent 5% of Canada’s population, they make up to 30% of the prison population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-video-of-aboriginal-chief-arrest-shocking-says-canadian-pm-trudeau/story-wiiTX853R7jxNFTrFsngjM.html

The annual celebration of the ancient Indian holistic practice will take place online in Canada this year, as restrictions due to the Covid-19 pandemic remain in place throughout the country.The Vancouver proclamation was followed from Burnaby , a city in British Columbia. Vancouver’s Mayor Kennedy Stewart signed the proclamation which noted that “Yoga has become an integral path to health and wellness in the city of Vancouver.” It also stated that “The city of Vancouver is home to a large and diverse Indo-Canadian community, that has contributed significantly to the economic, social and cultural fabric of the city.”India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria welcomed the Vancouver proclamation, tweeting, “Thank you for embracing yoga!”The 5,000-year-old Indian tradition was recognised by the United Nations General Assembly in December 2014 as it declared June 21 as International Day of Yoga.Since then, this day has been marked in several cities across Canada with large gatherings of practitioners and enthusiasts, including events at the Niagara Falls. The Coronavirus pandemic, however, has prevented such physical gatherings. To celebrate the sixth anniversary of the International Yoga Day, the Indian High Commission, along with the consulates in Toronto and Vancouver has put together a series of sessions on social media, as part of its Yoga from Home programming.In keeping with the time in which these activities are occurring, among the sessions is one on yoga in management of Covid-19, as well as related sessions on boosting immunity and improving respiratory health. Among the organisations collaborating in the programmes are Patanjali Yoga Canada, Art of Living Canada, Brahmakumaris and Isha Yoga.The High Commission has organised a My Life My Yoga video blogging competition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/june-21-to-be-celebrated-as-international-day-of-yoga-in-vancouver/story-0ckyz9GUwEnL5oiCZ8560L.html
13-06-2020||World||Coronavirus hitting the Americas hardest says WHO||The Americas are bearing the brunt of the global coronavirus pandemic at present, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Friday, with North and South America currently having four of the 10 worst hit countries in the world.The disease was “highly active” in Central and South America, the WHO’s top emergency expert Mike Ryan said, highlighting problems in Brazil and Mexico.The current situation in Brazil, now one of the global hot-spots for the virus, was of increasing concern especially in heavily-populated cities, he told a press conference.The country’s health system was “still coping”, although some intensive care units were at a critical stage and under heavy pressure with more than 90% bed occupancy rates, Ryan said.Mexico meanwhile has nearly 130,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19, and more than 15,000 deaths, the WHO said.Brazil is the second worst hit country in the world, with more than 800,000 cases and 41,000 deaths, according to a Reuters tally. Both countries lag behind the United States, the worst hit country, which has had more than 2 million cases and nearly 114,000 deaths.“We are very much in the upswing of this pandemic, particularly in the global South,” Ryan said. “Some countries are having trouble exiting of the so-called lockdowns as they are seeing an increase in cases.”It was possible the disease was spreading again as societies reopened and people began meeting again, especially when there was inadequate testing and social distancing was insufficient.Still, he acknowledged the pressures on countries to get back to normal especially to reduce the economic damage the crisis has wrought.”There is a careful balance between keeping people at home... and the untoward effect of that on economic and society. That is not an easy balance. There are no correct answers,” Ryan said.Ryan said that although some countries appeared to be over the worst of the virus, clusters of the disease were still occurring. WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Gheybreyesus said that vigilance was required worldwide against the “very dangerous virus” even in regions where it appeared to be on the wane.“Our fear is although it is declining in Europe it is increasing in other parts of the world.

13-06-2020||World||Pakistan unveils 7.13 trillion budget for new fiscal year, defence gets around 1.3 trillion||Pakistan government on Friday unveiled a Rs 7.13 trillion (Rs 7,13,700 crore) “corona budget” for the new fiscal year, including a Rs 1.289 trillion (Rs 1,28,900 crore) defence budget which is almost 4.7 per cent higher than last year’s.Last year the defence budget was 1.227 trillion (1,22,700 crore).The government set a meagre 2.1 per cent GDP growth target for the next year.Minister for Industries and Production Hammad Azhar presented the budget for the fiscal year 2020-21 in the National Assembly, the lower house of Parliament amidst a spike in the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.Prime Minister Imran Khan was present during the budget session. “The budget has been based on the current critical situation due to the coronavirus pandemic. So we are trying to give maximum relief to the people and not imposing any new tax,” Azhar said.He said the total expenses of the government would be Rs 7.13 trillion (Rs 7,13,700 crores), but there would be a Rs 3,437 billion (3,43,700 crores) deficit in revenues and expenses which was 7 per cent of the GDP.He said that the total tax revenues would be Rs 6,573 billion (6,57,300 crores). But the bulk of the revenues would go to the provinces under a previous formula which Azhar announced to change. He said the total development budget of the centre and province would be Rs 1,324 billion (1,32,400 crores), whereas the federal component of the development programmes would be Rs 650 billion (65,000 crores), which include 73 per cent for ongoing projects and 27 per cent for new projects.Among the most controversial moves was to freeze the salaries and pensions of the serving and retired government servants who traditionally were given a raise in the budget. “Lockdown, social distancing and precautionary measures have adversely affected the economy. Like other economies around the world, Pakistan’s economy also took a hit due to the coronavirus,” he said.Azhar said Rs 55 billion (5,500 crores) special grant would be given to the Pakistan-occupied government and Rs 32 billion (3,200 crores) special grant to the Gilgit-Baltistan government. He said that the government was trying to increase taxes as the current tax to GDP ratio was 11 per cent which was very low as compared to other nations. “We are trying to improve our ratio.” Among the increase in taxes, he said the tax on tobacco and its products was increased from 65 per cent to 100 per cent.He said that the government as per policy did not receive any loan from the State Bank of Pakistan. He said no supplementary grants were given to any department and strict financial discipline was followed and the policy would continue. It was the second budget of the Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government which came to power in August 2018 and is still struggling to stabilize the economy, which registered negative 0.38 per cent growth in the outgoing fiscal year ending on June 30.Opposition parties protested vociferously against the policies of the Imran Khan-led government, creating ruckus in Parliament. But the minister continued his speech and presented the budget.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-unveils-7-13-trillion-budget-for-new-fiscal-year-defence-gets-around-1-3-trillion/story-lP1rBsVCMg2QDhmXNeMQXM.html

13-06-2020||World||‘Existing polio vaccine shows promise, could protect against Covid-19’: Study||While scientists and experts continue to bolster the effort to arrive at the much-awaited vaccine for Covid-19, some experts are looking at the potential of existing drugs and vaccines in fighting the virus. A latest study published in the medical journal Science explains if existing live vaccines can help prevent Covid-19.The study talks about oral polio vaccine (OPV) which comprises live attenuated viruses and can reduce the incidence of other infections.“An increasing body of evidence suggests that live attenuated vaccines can also induce broader protection against unrelated pathogens likely by inducing interferon and other innate immunity mechanisms that are yet to be identified,” the study reads. Also read: Centre reviews use of HCQ and antibiotic combo in Covid-19 casesAccording to the researchers, the stimulation of innate immune system by live attenuated vaccines in general, and oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) in particular, “could provide temporary protection against coronavirus disease 2019”The research also points to the efficacy of certain vaccines against tuberculosis and whooping cough in fighting infections. “Attenuated bacterial vaccines such as Bacillus Calmette–Guérin (BCG) against tuberculosis, as well as experimental live attenuated vaccine against pertussis (whooping cough), were also shown to protect against heterologous infections,” it added. Medical reports and scientific research suggest that Covid-19 may result in suppressed innate immune responses. Therefore, stimulation of innate immunity by live attenuated vaccines such as the OPV could increase resistance to infection by “the causal virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)”.“If the results of randomized controlled trial (RCTs) with OPV are positive, OPV could be used to protect the most vulnerable populations,” the study concluded. Covid-19 has infected over 7 million people worldwide while more than 4 lakh people have lost their lives across the globe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-vaccine-update-existing-polio-vaccine-shows-promise-could-protect-against-covid-19-study/story-wAFnAe9VTOZ6vgKa98RX3H.html
13-06-2020||World||George Floyd death: New York governor signs police accountability legislation||New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed into law on Friday a sweeping package of police accountability measures that received new backing following protests of George Floyd’s killing, including one allowing the release of officers’ long-withheld disciplinary records.The measures were approved earlier this week by the state’s Democratic-led Legislature. Some of the bills had been proposed in years past and failed to win approval, but lawmakers moved with new urgency in the wake of massive, nationwide demonstrations over Floyd’s death at the hands of police in Minneapolis.“Police reform is long overdue, and Mr. Floyd’s murder is only the most recent murder,” Cuomo, a Democrat, said.Cuomo was joined at the signing ceremony by the Rev. Al Sharpton, Valerie Bell, the mother of Sean Bell, who was killed by an officer in 2006, and Gwen Carr, the mother of Eric Garner, who was killed by police in New York in 2014.“It was a long time coming, but it came,” Carr said.Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins thanks Carr and Bell “for being brave and strong.”“We are at a moment of reckoning. There is no doubt about it,” she said.The laws will ban police chokeholds, make it easier to sue people who call police on others without good reason, and set up a special prosecutor’s office to investigate the deaths of people during and following encounters with police officers.“These bills mean some substantive change, so that we won’t be sitting here going over this after the next funeral and after the next situation,” Sharpton said.Some bills, including body camera legislation, drew support from Republicans, who opposed legislation that repealed a state law long used to block the release of police disciplinary records over concerns about officers’ privacy.Eliminating the law, known as Section 50-a, would make complaints against officers, as well as transcripts and final dispositions of disciplinary proceedings, public for the first time in decades.New York Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Jessica McRorie said the department “will review the final version of the legislation and utilize it in a manner that ensures greater transparency and fairness.”The state’s approximately 500 police departments will all have to come up with plans to address everything from use of force to implicit bias awareness training by next April under an executive order that Cuomo said he will issue Friday.The governor said New York is the first to come up with such a plan and warned that police departments who fail to do so will not receive state aid.Patrick Lynch, president of the Police Benevolent Association, the city’s largest police union, said in a news release that Cuomo and the legislative leaders “have no business celebrating today.”Lynch said police officers spend their days addressing the “failures” of elected officials. “Now, we won’t even be able to do that,” he said. “We will be permanently frozen, stripped of all resources and unable to do the job.”Meanwhile, members of the New York City Council said they would be working to cut $1 billion in NYPD spending for the next fiscal year. The cuts would include overtime, headcount through attrition and shifting the department’s responsibilities, according to a joint council statement.“Our budget must reflect the reality that policing needs fundamental reform. Over the last few weeks, we have seen an outpouring of New Yorkers demanding change from their leaders,” the statement said. “It is our job to listen – and to act. We will not let this moment pass, and we will fight for the budget they deserve.”Cuomo has 10 days to act on other bills passed by lawmakers this week, including legislation prohibiting police from using racial profiling and another bill ensuring that individuals under arrest or in policy custody receive attention for medical and mental health needs.Lawmakers also passed a bill to require New York to collect and report the race and other demographic details of individuals who are charged. The legislation says police departments must “promptly report” to the state the death of any people who die in police custody and in an attempt to establish custody, and provide a demographic breakdown.During this week’s legislative debates, many lawmakers relayed their personal experiences with police.On Friday, Stewart-Cousins, who is the first black woman to lead the state Senate, said her youngest son was once stopped and frisked when he was 18 and said he ended up with a fractured nose. “Thank God I was able to bring him home,” she said.“Every parent, every mother who looks like me understood that scary notion with our kids, with our husbands, with our brothers,” she said.Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie said he’s had “not-so-positive” interactions with the police — from when he was young and even now as legislative leader.“Growing up when you heard the stories of Anthony Baez and Sean Bell and Eric Garner, as a black man, I felt that could be me,” Heastie said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-new-york-governor-signs-police-accountability-legislation/story-ebdKo2CojIya77TpvJlx3J.html
13-06-2020||World||Protests and a violent arrest reveal Canada’s racial cracks||The racial turmoil that has gripped the US is causing Canada to publicly confront its own shortcomings in the treatment of minority groups by police and other authorities.Against the backdrop of protests across North America over the death of George Floyd, Canada’s longest-standing racial fault line -- the treatment of its indigenous people -- burst into view as a video surfaced of the violent arrest of a prominent First Nations leader.The footage showed Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers tackling and punching Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation Chief Allan Adam in Fort McMurray, Alberta, in March during a dispute about expired license plates. Adam can be seen bleeding from the face as he is led away by officers. He was charged with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer. His lawyer is now seeking to have the charges stayed on the basis that his rights were violated because of his race.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said an investigation of the incident by Alberta authorities must be open and transparent and acknowledged that many black and indigenous Canadians don’t feel safe around police. He said he raised the issue during a weekly call with the country’s premiers and that he’ll look at changes to prevent similar incidents from occurring in the future.“Systemic racism is an issue right across the country, in all our institutions, including in all our police forces, including in the RCMP,” Trudeau said.Troubled HistoryThe video of the Adam arrest followed a week in which thousands of Canadians in cities across the country marched to show their solidarity with US protesters. The footage also served to underscore that Canada is far from immune to the racial strife of its neighbor to the south -- and has its own problems in policing.In a mirror of the issues that have driven American protesters into the streets, a Canadian Broadcasting Corp. investigation in 2018 found that black and indigenous people are disproportionately the victims of fatal encounters with police. Immigration and religious differences have also been a source of conflict. Quebec faced a backlash over a policy that restricted traditional Muslim face coverings. Last year, famous hockey announcer Don Cherry was fired over comments about immigrants that many called racist.But perhaps no racial issue in Canada is as painful as its troubled history of mistreating indigenous groups. Last year, a federal investigation found that the country had “staggering rates” of violence against indigenous women and girls, due to “persistent and deliberate” rights violations and abuses.The issue of indigenous control of their traditional territories -- a common flashpoint in negotiations over resource projects like logging, oil development and pipelines -- exploded into a series of protests that blocked railways earlier this year, following the arrest of some First Nations protesters in British Columbia.“This systemic discrimination and racism has been here for hundreds of years,” said Lorraine Whitman, president of the Native Women’s Association of Canada. “It has to be addressed, and it has to be addressed now.”Whitman gives poor grades to Canada’s efforts to rectify these problems. Even the government of Trudeau, who has a global image as a “woke” leader and who made reconciliation with native peoples a key plank of his 2015 campaign, has failed to take sufficient action, she said. Some conservatives mocked Trudeau’s efforts by calling him the ‘Apologizer-in-Chief.’Race DataThere are signs some government bodies are making changes as a result of the recent protests -- including a couple of longstanding policies that made it difficult to properly analyze racial injustice.The Ontario agency that probes police incidents and misconduct, known as the Special Investigations Unit, said this week it will begin collecting race-based data. The unit previously collected only the ages and genders of people involved in incidents that led to serious injury, death or sexual assault.The country’s national statistics agency also said it will begin gathering labor force data by race with its July report, bringing it in line with its US counterpart, which has long done so. Statistics Canada’s monthly labor force survey currently doesn’t track employment conditions by visible-minority status, making it difficult to ascertain how economic disruptions such as Covid-19 are affecting black Canadians and other groups. The survey does include data on immigrants and indigenous Canadians.“We know that there are unfairnesses in our systems,” Trudeau said earlier this week. “It’s just really hard to change, and what it takes is a recognition and a desire to make these changes. That’s exactly what we need to start doing as a country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-and-a-violent-arrest-reveal-canada-s-racial-cracks/story-ogrBMKMciMxb5zwQw6qE2M.html

Li died from coronavirus in February, his wife Fu Xuejie was pregnant with their second child. Fu Xuejie shared the baby boy’s image on instant messaging app WeChat on Friday and described the newborn as the “final gift” from her late husband. Li, who worked as an ophthalmologist at the Wuhan central hospital, was arrested by Chinese authorities for spreading rumours. He was trying to sound an alarm about Covid-19 situation in the country which quickly assumed the shape of a pandemic. On December 30, Li chanced upon a test result of a patient who had been admitted to his hospital with a new, unidentified disease. He shared the information on a private WeChat group with seven other friends, saying that from the results it looked like SARS - an epidemic which killed hundreds in China in 2002-03.Li later said he only wanted to warn friends about the disease but his post went viral.The doctor and his friends were soon summoned by the Wuhan police for spreading rumours and were forced to sign a confession. After his release,Li he went back to the hospital and started working but contracted Covid-19 from a patient.Li was hospitalised on January 12 and in the following days, his condition deteriorated. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and tested positive for Covid-19, he subsequently lost his life.

Anmol Narang, is a second-generation immigrant born and raised in Roswell, Georgia. She did a year of undergraduate study at the Georgia Institute of Technology before transferring to West Point, where she will graduate Saturday with a degree in nuclear engineering. She hopes to pursue a career in air defense systems.“I am excited and honored to be fulfilling my dream of graduating from West Point,” Narang said in a news release from the Sikh Coalition, a nonprofit based in New York that works to protect the constitutional right to practice faith without fear. “The confidence and support of my community back home in Georgia has been deeply meaningful to me, and I am humbled that in reaching this goal, I am showing other Sikh Americans that any career path is possible for anyone willing to rise to the challenge.” Narang will complete her Basic Officer Leadership Course at Fort Sill in Lawton, Oklahoma, officials said. Following that, she will then head to her first post in Okinawa, Japan, in January.Congress passed a law in 1987 that prohibited Sikhs and other religious communities from maintaining their articles of faith while in the military. A Sikh’s visible articles of faith, including turbans and unshorn facial hair, were banned.Narang required no accommodation for her articles of faith, but the coalition said “her exemplary service to date underscores how diversity and pluralism remain core strengths of the U.S. military and the country as a whole.” US Army Capt. Simratpal Singh, a family friend, said he is proud of Narang who is “breaking a barrier for any Sikh American who wishes to serve.” “The broader acceptance of Sikh service members among all of the service branches, as well as in top tier leadership spaces like West Point, will continue to benefit not just the rights of religious minority individuals, but the strength and diversity of the U.S. military,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-sikh-woman-to-graduate-from-us-military-academy-at-west-point/story-jldZ4T9IiFZEp8tJPuzC9N.html
13-06-2020||World||Democratic presidential nominee Biden’s VP list narrows||Joe Biden’s search for a running mate is entering a second round of vetting for a dwindling list of potential vice presidential nominees, with several black women in strong contention.Democrats with knowledge of the process said Biden’s search committee has narrowed the choices to as few as six serious contenders after initial interviews. Among the group still in contention: Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Kamala Harris of California, as well as Susan Rice, who served as President Barack Obama’s national security adviser.Those with knowledge declined to name other contenders and said the process remains somewhat fluid. Additional candidates may still be asked to submit to the extensive document review process now underway for some top contenders. Those familiar with Biden’s search spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss the process.The campaign dismissed the idea of a shortened list as early speculation. “Those who talk don’t know and those who know don’t talk,” said Andrew Bates, a Biden spokesperson.Biden, who has already said he will pick a woman as his running mate, is facing increased calls from Democrats to put a woman of color on the ticket — both because of the outsize role that black voters played in Biden’s road to the nomination and because of the reckoning over racism and inequality roiling the nation following the death of George Floyd. The black Minneapolis man died after a white police officer pressed his knee on his neck for several minutes, an episode that was captured on video.Terry McAuliffe, the former Virginia governor and former Democratic National Committee chairman, said that while Biden’s choice was likely to be “all about personal chemistry,” it would be “exciting for the party” to have a black woman on a major party presidential ticket for the first time.The campaign’s list includes several black women, including Harris and Rice. Advisers have also looked closely at Florida Rep. Val Demings and Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms, both of whom are black, and New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Latina.Biden’s vetting committee had conversations with a larger group of women earlier this spring; those continuing on in the process have been asked to turn over financial records, past writings and other documentation. Biden has had various public and private interactions with many of the women his vetting committee has considered thus far, but has not yet had any formal one-on-one interviews expressly to discuss the No. 2 spot on the ticket. Those aren’t expected for several weeks.Rice, who worked closely with Biden during his time as vice president, has emerged as a favorite among some former Obama administration officials and is personally close to the former president. She has never held elected office but has extensive foreign policy experience, including as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. She’s also been an outspoken critic of the Trump administration since leaving the White House and considered running for U.S. Senate in Maine.Rice has long been a target of Republicans, including for statements she made after the deadly 2012 attacks on Americans in Benghazi, Libya. Republicans have also accused her of spying on Michael Flynn, Trump’s first national security adviser, though records declassified by the Trump administration show no evidence of Rice improperly accessing any information.Harris and Warren have been seen as top contenders for the No. 2 spot since ending their own presidential campaigns.Warren and Biden have forged a surprising bond in recent months and talk regularly about the progressive policy ideas the Massachusetts senator put at the forefront of her campaign. Biden already has adopted her proposed bankruptcy law overhaul. And now, with the coronavirus pandemic and resulting economic slowdown elevating the nuts-and-bolts of governing, some Democrats see Warren’s policy credentials as an asset to the ticket.A Biden-Warren pairing would mean both Democrats on the ticket are white and in their 70s. Biden is 77, and Warren is 70.Harris is the lone black contender who has won statewide office, notable experience given Biden’s emphasis on wanting a partner “ready to be president.” She and Biden have also demonstrated a comfortable manner with each other in online fundraisers. Harris is an expert voice in discussions of criminal justice, but some black progressives view her background as a prosecutor skeptically.One contender whose standing does appear to have fallen is Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who was a prosecutor years ago in the county that includes Minneapolis. During that period, more than two dozen people — mostly minorities — died during encounters with police.While the people with knowledge of Biden’s vetting process did not rule Klobuchar out, she is widely viewed among Democrats with close ties to the Biden campaign as less likely to be tapped given recent events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-presidential-nominee-biden-s-vp-list-narrows/story-vbt5AU2hdGHY7QquSTrivO.html

In a redacted Dec. 1, 2018 memo, CSIS said it was advised by the US FBI of plans to arrest Meng when she arrived on a flight to Vancouver International Airport later that same day.“The arrest is likely to send shockwaves around the world,” CSIS said. “The planned event will be of great consequence internationally and bilaterally,” the report said.Huawei lawyers called the documents proof that authorities had conspired against Meng.Meng is accused by US authorities of bank fraud for misleading HSBC about Huawei’s relationship with a company operating in Iran, putting HSBC at risk of fines and penalties for breaking US sanctions on Tehran.Meng’s lawyers have argued the case should be thrown out because Canada did not have sanctions against Iran. Meng says she is innocent. Last month, a Canadian judge allowed the case to continue, rejecting defense arguments that the US charges against Meng do not constitute crimes in Canada.The new court documents show the CSIS was concerned about when Meng’s arrest might become public. Her lawyers noted the point was of particular interest, since Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping were attending the G20 summit in Argentina and dining together on the evening of Dec. 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-spy-agency-warned-of-shock-waves-from-arrest-of-huawei-founder-s-daughter/story-61ldDnkQoIbobxAn0cLaUI.html
13-06-2020||World||Firefighters grapple with triple-digit heat against wildfire||Hundreds of Arizona residents under an evacuation notice were allowed to return home Friday but were told to remain ready to leave at a moment’s notice as a wildfire burns in a national forest near Tucson.Firefighters are trying to keep the blaze in canyons and ridges and prevent it from moving downhill.“The fire activity near the homes has dropped down due to the good work of our firefighters,” said Adam Jarrold, public information officer for the fire management team.Most of the western United States is experiencing extreme dryness or drought, creating challenging conditions for wildfire season, Bryan Henry, meteorologist with the National Interagency Fire Center, said in a recent fire season outlook.Authorities have said southern Arizona’s dry, hot weather and the steep, rocky topography have been the main challenges in fighting the fire. Friday was the hottest day yet for crews battling the blaze, with temperatures forecast to reach 107 (41.6 Celsius) in the afternoon.National Weather Service forecasters said temperatures were projected to remain in the triple digits through the weekend with a 10% chance of dry thunderstorms or potentially dangerous downbursts that bring only a trace of moisture but can kick up gusts of wind that feed flames.“We do have some weather concerns,” said incident meteorologist Gary Zell, who was stationed Friday at now-closed Catalina State Park.“These guys are heroes, working all day in up to 107 degrees (41.6 Celsius),” said Zell, who has worked wildfires around the West for two decades. “This is the first time I’ve worked a fire in my hometown so I’m pretty vested in making sure everything goes well.”Authorities said the fire’s growth slowed overnight Thursday but that it remained a threat. Flames have been visible from Tucson at night, and smoke from the fire plumed over a suburb Friday morning. Later in the day, an air tanker was seen spreading red fire retardant over the flames.The firefighting effort will get help from Federal Emergency Management Agency, which officials say has granted Arizona’s request for federal funds.The fire, sparked June 5 by lightning, was only 10% contained as of Friday morning. The National Wildfire Coordinating Group said in its daily operation plan that containment may not be achieved for weeks.Pima County officials on Thursday issued an evacuation notice for approximately 300 homes in a area south of the Coronado National Forest. But the notice was pulled back late Friday afternoon after fire officials determined it was safe for them to return home, said Deputy James Allerton, a sheriff’s department spokesman.Horses at the Catalina State Park Equestrian Center were transported out of the area for their safety.As of Friday, the fire had burned 11 square miles (29 square kilometers) of mostly brush and tall grass. Specialized crews were assessing potential threats to homes and other structures to identify access routes and develop contingency plans in case the fire spreads into residential areas.In the neighborhoods closest to the fire, sheriff’s deputies checked IDs to confirm that people trying to enter were residents, as helicopters dropped water on hot spots.Sheriff’s officials went door to door in neighborhoods on Thursday to notify residents of the evacuation notice, which a sheriff’s spokesman said Friday wasn’t mandatory.“People are not required to leave, however we are telling people we may not be able to come back and assist if things start to burn,” said Deputy James Allerton.No injuries or structural damage was reported, Allerton said.Travis Mayberry, an operations section chief for the fire management team, said Friday much of the fire was burning in terrain too rugged for grounds crews to work safely, particularly if they needed to escape quickly.“It’s not a great place for us to put people in to safely work,” he said. “Ït’s just too steep.”“In Oro Valley, on another side of the Santa Catalina mountains, dozens of people parked their vehicles Friday afternoon alongside State Route 77 to watch three helicopters battling flames descending the slopes as smoke poured into the sky.The Pima County Sheriff’s Department has been asking people to avoid the area during the fire unless they live or have business there to prevent traffic congestion and roadway dangers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firefighters-grapple-with-triple-digit-heat-against-wildfire/story-P1ckNjQrgWRtDg10Pscx6H.html

In a release, ARI noted, “When it comes to the economic outlook for the country, residents are near-evenly divided about whether the worst has passed or is yet to come. Older men are more optimistic, while all other age and gender groups are relatively closely divided.” Those feeling confident about the future narrowly outnumber those despondent: 51 per cent to 49 per cent. Also read| Canada’s junk food consumption, alcohol and tobacco intake rises amid Covid-19: SurveyMore troubling, it said, was data from the survey is the “dramatic increase” in the number of those expressing doubt about whether their jobs will return or those positions are gone permanently. ARI stated, “At the end of March just 17 per cent expressed these sentiments. Today, that number has more than doubled to 38 per cent.”The percentage of people who are doubtful about returning to their positions with same number of hours they worked prior to the pandemic have spiked from 13 per cent in March to 29 per cent. And those who believe their jobs have gone for good have more than doubled from 4 to 9 per cent. These sentiments come despite Canada recording a surprise addition of 290,000 jobs in the month of May, though unemployment, at nearly 14 per cent, remains at a historic high.Also read: Canadian PM Trudeau defends decision to attend protest amid Covid-19 curbsCanada crossed 8,000 deaths from the virus on Friday, though the increase in fatalities, at just 55, has been declining day by day.

It said, “As communities begin to allow businesses, schools, and other institutions to reopen, the gaze of many Canadians has shifted at least slightly to their province’s – and their own – economic recovery.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-covid-19-numbers-fall-canadians-pessimistic-about-country-s-economy/story-Ue9SFk0fd6g7iw3ak0yenI.html
13-06-2020||World||Known blood pressure drugs do not put patients at greater Covid-19 risk: Study||New research offers reassuring evidence to hundreds of millions of people with high blood pressure that popular anti-hypertension drugs do not put them at greater risk from Covid-19 as some experts had feared.Two blood pressure-lowering drug classes, called ACE inhibitors and ARBs, came under scrutiny after the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported in April that 72% of hospitalized Covid-19 patients 65 or older had hypertension.ACE inhibitors and ARBs are thought to trigger activity along the same biological pathways used by the Covid-19 novel coronavirus to attack the lungs.Researchers at Oxford University had recommended some patients stop the drugs until the risks were better known, while others argued patients should stay on the medications. An expert at the Johns Hopkins Center for Drug Safety and Effectiveness in Baltimore described the debate as “one of the most important clinical questions.”The new study made publicly available on Friday found no clinically significant increased risk of either a diagnosis or hospitalization of Covid-19 with ACE or ARB use compared with other first-line drug treatments for hypertension.The authors recommended that patients should not discontinue their treatment to avoid the virus, which has infected over 7.5 million people worldwide and killed more than 420,000.“Our findings are quite reassuring,” said Marc Suchard, a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles, who co-led the study. “Taking an ACE or an ARB is just as safe as other first-list hypertension agents in terms of your risk of contracting Covid-19.”The study analyzed the electronic medical records of 1.1 million patients on anti-hypertension drugs from the United States and Spain and has not yet been peer reviewed.It was part of the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics program (OHDSI, pronounced Odyssey) response to Covid-19, in collaboration with the US Department of Veterans Affairs, Columbia University Irving Medical Center, and SIDIAP, a Spanish health research organization.OHDSI is an open-source collaborative research platform that conducts large-scale studies.The findings join a growing body of evidence showing that the life-saving drugs neither increase nor reduce the risk of contracting Covid-19 or developing a severe case of the virus.Harmony R. Reynolds, a cardiologist at New York University Grossman School of Medicine and the lead author of a study published last month in The New England Journal of Medicine, said she had been besieged by calls from worried patients.With little research to go on, she advised them to stay on the drugs and embarked on a study with colleagues to analyze the medical records of over 12,000 Covid-19 patients at NYU’s Langone Health system. They found that those using ACE inhibitors or ARBs were no more likely to test positive than those who were not, nor was their risk of severe illness higher. The same held true for other classes of drugs - beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers and thiazide diuretics.Separate studies of more than 12,000 patients in Spain and more than 30,000 health system beneficiaries in Italy reached similar conclusions. They were published last month in The Lancet and the New England Journal, respectively.Another study in the New England Journal in May reported no increased risk of hospital deaths associated with ACE inhibitors. Both that study and another on hydroxychloroquine were retracted earlier this month after the co-authors said they could no longer vouch for the validity of the data they obtained from Surgisphere, a private medical record firm, however.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/known-blood-pressure-drugs-do-not-put-patients-at-greater-covid-19-risk-study/story-oyiCNUK3xsdZKQgnAcH3yK.html

13-06-2020||World||Jacksonville’s history complicates Republican convention||When Republicans descend on Jacksonville, Florida, to officially renominate President Donald Trump for a second term, it will be a well-choreographed affair that will unfold against the backdrop of a backdrop of a military town, a bastion of conservatism and a must-win battleground state.When he accepts his party’s nomination in late August for another White House bid, the president will be doing so amid the political and racial divisions deeply ingrained in his host city.“I think Jacksonville will take a lot of people by surprise in its diversity. But this is a complicated city,” said Alan Bliss, the chief executive officer of the Jacksonville Historical Society.“I think it’s been seen as inflexibly and uncritically conservative,” he said. “Jacksonville has been seen as having clung uncritically and inflexibly to its ideas of its past.”It is a place still coming to terms with its Southern heritage while trying to become a more cosmopolitan place in the shadows of glitzier Miami, with its world-famous beaches, and better-known Orlando, home to Disney World and Universal studios.The city’s sprawling metropolitan region is home to 1.5 million Floridians, nearly a third of them black and about a tenth Latino. It lies just south of Florida’s border with Georgia, and about 290 miles (about 467 kilometers) north of the president’s Mar-a-Lago compound in Palm Beach.The Republican National Committee picked Jacksonville for the political spectacle after North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat, wouldn’t give in to the president’s insistence that large gathering be held without social distancing measures. On Friday, Florida announced its highest one-day spike in Covid-19 cases — with 1,900 new cases the day before — but officials said they will take necessary precautions during the August convention.The city, which openly campaigned for the right to host the president and the political convention, had to overcome concerns that it could host a major event. When the city hosted the Super Bowl in 2005, it had to use cruise ships as floating hotels to expand its inventory of rooms.Routine convention business will still be held in Charlotte, but splashier events will take place in Jacksonville, one of Florida’s largest cities best known for its professional football team, the Jacksonville Jaguars.It is home to one of the country’s most important seaports, as well as the largest Navy base in the Southeast.Jacksonville has long been known as a bastion of conservatism, but in recent years it has become more diverse politically. While it remains a Republican stronghold, it’s not always as reliable as it once was.In 2011, Jacksonville elected its first black mayor, a Democrat. Five years later, Trump narrowly won Duval County. But two years ago, black Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum got more of the county’s votes than now-Gov. Ron DeSantis, a close Trump ally.“Jacksonville has made a few strides, but Jacksonville still has not shown that it wants to deal with some of its problems, especially the race problems it needs to deal with,” said Rodney Hurst, 76.Sixty years ago, Hurst was part of a group of young black men and women who had just dispersed from a peaceful protest at a downtown lunch counter when a mob of whites began indiscriminately clubbing African Americans in downtown Jacksonville. The day is now remembered as Ax Handle Saturday.“They swung at me, and I had no choice but to run,” recalled Hurst, who was 16 when the mob came charging at him with clubs.The anniversary of that day will be remembered in a public square across City Hall — on the same day as the president’s Aug. 27 made-for-television address.The commemoration will be held a mile away from the convention, in a park named for Civil War veteran Charles C. Hemming, after he donated a towering Confederate monument in the park in 1898. Earlier this week, the city removed the monument in the cloak of darkness amid protests across the country decrying racism and deadly police force against blacks.The city’s mayor, Lenny Curry, vowed to remove other monuments, as statues across the South and elsewhere were being vandalized or toppled by protesters.“If our opinions and our policies don’t evolve, then we’re not growing and we are stagnant,” said Curry, a former chair of the Republican Party of Florida.A spokesman for the president said the campaign was mindful of the city’s racist past. Paris Dennard, an RNC adviser for black media affairs, called the president a “champion” for the black community.“While we cannot erase some of the darkest moments of our nation’s past, we can denounce them, learn from them, fight for justice and a more perfect union for every American. That is exactly what President Trump has done,” Dennard said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jacksonville-s-history-complicates-republican-convention/story-Z8LTxbtAuR71quoM8XZZLM.html

The crisis could provoke the region’s “worst recession in history”, the UN Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) said.“We’re worried the region could come out of this crisis with more debt, poorer, hungrier and with more unemployment. And most of all, angry,” said ECLAC general secretary Alicia Barcena.The fracture lines in Brazilian society are already evident. The country’s President, Jair Bolsonaro, has repeatedly downplayed the pandemic’s scale, calling Covid-19 “a flu”.Brazil on Thursday passed two grim milestones: 40,000 Covid-19 deaths and some 800,000 coronavirus cases. Despite the rising toll Brazil’s two largest cities - Sao Paulo and Rio de Janeiro - reopened shopping malls, even as the health ministry said there had been more than 1,200 deaths in the last 24 hours and more than 30,000 new cases.Protesting that stance, campaigners on Thursday dug 100 graves on Copacabana Beach in Rio de Janeiro, each marked with a black cross, to denounce what they called the “incompetence” of authorities.n the US, President Donald Trump was leading the charge to continue reopening the economy. The pandemic is not tamed there, with more than 2 million infections and 114,000 deaths. Figures showed a spike in new infections in key states including Texas, California, Arizona and Florida.In China, Beijing reported two more confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours, taking the tally of new infections to three in less than a week after city authorities lowered the outbreak emergency response to level three.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-roils-latin-america-as-the-region-faces-recession/story-5Zb4uaMlQkYZh1inHb8BbN.html
13-06-2020||World||Donald Trump says he will ‘do other things’ if he loses 2020 US presidential election||US president Donald Trump said he will go on to other things if he loses the November 3 election, after Democratic opponent Joe Biden said the Republican might cheat and refuse to leave the White House.“Certainly if I don’t win, I don’t win. I mean, you know, go on and do other things,” Trump told Fox News Channel in a television interview broadcast on Friday.As the race between Trump and Biden heats up ahead of the election, the two have increasingly asserted that the other side intends to cheat their way to victory.Biden, who is leading Trump in most national polls, earlier this week said his greatest concern was that Trump would try to “steal” the election, though the former vice president did not elaborate on how he thought Trump might cheat. Biden said he is confident soldiers would escort Trump from the White House if he loses and does not recognize the result.Trump’s comment to Fox News suggested he could accept the election result but the president did not specifically say so. Trump campaign spokesman Tim Murtaugh on Thursday said Trump would accept the result. ​ Trump has accused Democrats of aiming to use an increase in mail-in voting as a venue for rigging the election, while Biden has pledged to deploy lawyers to polling stations across the country to look out for Republican efforts to suppress the vote.Election experts and officials are bracing for a potentially tumultuous election night.A surge in mail-in voting is expected due to concerns over the coronavirus pandemic, and experts warn the process could be marred by chaos of the type already seen in primary elections held in states during the viral outbreak.Large numbers of mail ballots not delivered in time to be cast or counted could lead to legal challenges over election results. Counting mail ballots also takes more time because a voter’s identity must first be validated, raising the prospect that the election outcome will not be known well past Election Day, experts say.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-will-do-other-things-if-he-loses-2020-us-presidential-election/story-4wPJY264k3uPz3A8vW6chL.html
13-06-2020||World||Black Lives Matter: Gandhi statue protected as London set for tense weekend||Extreme far-right groups are planning counter-protests over the weekend in London when large numbers of Black Lives Matter activists are expected to stage another demonstration, prompting officials to protect statues of Mahatma Gandhi and Winston Churchill.The London mayor’s office confirmed on Friday evening that Gandhi’s statue has been “temporarily covered for its protection”, as mayor Sadiq Khan and others appealed to people to stay away from the weekend demonstrations, which also pose challenges in the context of coronavirus.Khan said: “I’m extremely concerned that further protests in central London not only risk spreading Covid-19, but could lead to disorder, vandalism and violence. Extreme far-right groups who advocate hatred and division are planning counter-protests, which means that the risk of disorder is high”.“Be in no doubt these counter-protests are there to provoke violence, and their only goal is to distract and hijack this important issue. Staying home and ignoring them is the best response this weekend”, he added.Last Sunday witnessed the first major BLM demonstration in London, when the statues of Churchill and Gandhi were targeted, among others. In Bristol, the statue of slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down and thrown into the Avon river.A series of tweets, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Friday that it is “absurd and shameful” that Churchill’s statue had been targeted, and appealed to people not to join the weekend protests.Johnson, who wrote a biography of Churchill in 2014, added: “We cannot now try to edit or censor our past. We cannot pretend to have a different history. The statues in our cities and towns were put up by previous generations”.“They had different perspectives, different understandings or rights and wrongs. But those statues teach us about our past, with all its faults. To tear them down would be to lie about our history, and impoverish the education of generations to come”.The Leicester City Council is reviewing all street names, statues and monuments in the city with a large population of Indian origin. A petition for the removal of Gandhi’s statue there enlisted over 5,000 signatures by Friday evening.Keith Vaz, who was Leicester East MP for 33 years, said: “This is a dreadful petition that seeks to divide communities in Leicester and in the country. Those behind it know full well the consequences of what they are asking for. Gandhi’s statues in Leicester and London are an inspiration for peace, harmony and non-violence”.“He was one of the greatest peacemakers in history. If this is not withdrawn I will certainly refer it to the police to consider whether it incites racial hatred. We have come a long way in 33 years on racial equality but clearly there is a long way to go. If there is any attempt to remove it I will be there to defend it personally.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-gandhi-statue-protected-as-london-set-for-tense-weekend/story-DOR1VYBzjZLcr9GKD8uffI.html

The explosion occurred in Saddar area of the city, which is not far away from the General Headquarters of the Pakistan Army. Police spokesperson Sajidul Hassan told Dawn News that initial reports suggest that the explosive material was planted in a nearby electric pole. Properties around the site of the explosion have also been badly damaged. Authorities have cordoned off the area and rescue efforts are underway. The police spokesperson said that investigative teams and people from the forensics science lab were collecting evidence from the area. The spokesperson said that the blast was an “attempt at organised terrorism but those playing with the lives of the public would not be able to escape the law.” No one immediately claimed responsibility for the blast, which occurred when the country is battling the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bomb-explosion-in-pakistan-market-kills-one-15-injured/story-s0E14p0DpPX1yWtvKBFgsL.html

William Robert Cable, 38, allegedly preyed on homeless people in the city of Huntington Beach, feeding them food laced with oleoresin capsicum, which officials described as being twice as strong as pepper spray used by police. “They were exploited and poisoned as part of a twisted form of entertainment, and their pain was recorded so that it could be relived by their attacker over and over again,” Orange County District Attorney Todd Spitzer said in a statement Thursday. Some victims were told they were participating in a “spicy food challenge” and others were not, authorities said. Some were given other food and beer to get them to eat the poisoned food. The victims had seizure-like symptoms, difficulty breathing and suffered vomiting and intense mouth and stomach pain. Some had to be hospitalised. Officials asked for public help in identifying other victims and potential additional suspects. Cable, identified as a handyman from the Northern California community of San Andreas, was arrested May 22 by Huntington Beach police. He was charged with eight felony counts of poisoning, one felony count of inflicting injury on an elderly person, eight misdemeanour counts of contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and an infraction for consuming alcohol or smoking marijuana while driving. The statement from the district attorney and other law enforcement officials did not specify how the underage person was involved. “The inhumane nature of the crimes combined with targeting a vulnerable population shocks the conscience,” said Huntington Beach Police Chief Robert Handy. “The fact an adult criminal would involve a juvenile is even more reprehensible.” If convicted of all charges, Cable faces up to 19 years and three months in prison. Online jail records show he remained in custody Thursday on USD 500,000 bail with a court date scheduled next month. It was not immediately known if he has an attorney who could comment on his behalf.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-feeds-poison-laced-food-to-homeless-people-in-california-records-their-pain/story-vvv1A2z7Mm0ITOHUytqMmN.html
