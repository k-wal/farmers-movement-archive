14-06-2020||World||Atlanta officer fired after fatal shooting of black man||Atlanta police said Sunday the department fired one officer and placed another on administrative duty for the fatal shooting of a black man who resisted arrest after failing a field sobriety test — a death that rekindled fiery protests in the city and also caused the police chief to resign.Body camera footage released early Sunday by Atlanta police showed 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks appearing good-humored and largely cooperative with the two white officers after being found sleeping alone in a car blocking a Wendy’s drive-thru lane.“I know you’re just doing your job,” Brooks tells one of the officers about 40 minutes into the encounter when he agrees to a breath test. After he takes the test, an officer tries to handcuff Brooks and he attempts to flee — resulting in a struggle that ended with his death late Friday.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Brooks wrestled a Taser from one of the officers and ran. The GBI released security camera footage from the restaurant that showed a running Brooks turn and point an object in his hand toward an officer a few steps behind him. The video shows the officer draw his gun and fire as Brooks continues to run, then falls to the ground in the parking lot.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said Saturday: “I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force.”Officer Garrett Rolfe was terminated while officer Devin Brosnan has been placed on administrative duty, an Atlanta police spokesman, Sgt. John Chafee, said in a brief statement Sunday. Rolfe had worked for the department since October 2013, and Brosnan was hired in September 2018.Police Chief Erika Shields, who joined the department as a beat officer in 1995, resigned Saturday after nearly four years as chief. In a statement, Shields called for Atlanta to “move forward and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve.”Meanwhile, a demonstration that began peacefully Saturday morning outside the restaurant where Brooks was shot grew more turbulent after dark. Demonstrators marched onto nearby Interstate 75 and blocked traffic while the Wendy’s at the shooting scene was set ablaze and gutted by flames.Atlanta police said Sunday that 36 people had been arrested in connection with the protests, but gave no further details.Brooks’ death at the hands of police inflamed raw emotions in Atlanta and across the U.S. following the May 25 killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Some public officials questioned Sunday whether the shooting of Brooks was as clearly an abuse as Floyd’s death after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee to his neck.“The question is when the suspect turned to fire the Taser, what should the officer have done?” U.S. Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, said on CBS’ “Face The Nation.” Scott is the Senate’s only black Republican, and among GOP senators working on a package of policing changes.Scott said the police shooting of Brooks “is certainly a far less clear one than the ones that we saw with George Floyd and several other ones around the country.”Asked about the death of Brooks on “Fox News Sunday,” U.S. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson said: “I think this is a situation that is not clear-cut, like the callous murder that occurred in Minnesota.”Stacey Abrams, the former Democratic lawmaker who rose to national prominence with her 2018 campaign for Georgia governor, said “there’s a legitimacy to this outrage” that Brooks wound up dead after being found sleeping in a car.“We also know that a man taking a Taser from a police officer in Pennsylvania resulted in his arrest,” Abrams told ABC’s “This Week,” “but because this person was black, it resulted in his death.”In February, Pennsylvania State Police reported they arrested a 37-year-old man in Dover Township and charged him with aggravated assault and other crimes after the man grabbed a Taser from a state trooper and used it to stun the officer in the shoulder.L. Chris Stewart, an attorney for Brooks’ family, said Saturday evening the officer who shot him should be charged for “an unjustified use of deadly force, which equals murder.”Stewart said Brooks, a father of four, had celebrated the eighth birthday of one of his daughters Friday before he was killed.The GBI will pass the results of its investigation into the police shooting of Brooks to prosecutors in Fulton County, who will decide whether criminal charges are warranted against either officer.Body and dash camera video released by Atlanta police show more than 40 minutes elapses between the time Brosnan first knocks on Brooks’ car door at the Wendy’s drive-thru to when gunshots ring out. Rolfe arrives on scene about 16 minutes into the encounter.Rolfe is seen on body camera video administering the field sobriety test, followed by a breath test with Brooks’ consent. He moves to arrest Brooks after the breath test. While he doesn’t tell Brooks the result, the machine displays a 0.108 in video captured by Rolfe’s own body camera. That’s greater than the blood alcohol concentration of 0.08 grams that’s considered too intoxicated to drive under Georgia law.Both body cameras fall off during the struggle that ensues when Rolfe moves to handcuff Brooks. Gunshots are audible in some of the footage, but weren’t captured on video in any of the four recordings provided by police.The security camera video of the shooting released Saturday by the GBI does not show Brooks’ initial struggle with police.GBI Director Vic Reynolds said Brooks had grabbed a Taser from one officer and appeared to point it at the officer as he fled. He estimated the officer fired three shots.___This story has been corrected to show that Stacey Abrams ran for governor in 2018, not 2016.___Bynum reported from Savannah, Georgia.

14-06-2020||World||Most Americans say wealth hasn’t improved during Trump years||The “Trump Bump” hasn’t benefited most Americans, with fewer than one in six saying their personal finances have improved since Donald Trump became president, according to a survey commissioned by Bankrate.com.Almost twice as many respondents said they’re worse off since Trump moved into the White House in January 2017, while about half of the U.S. adults polled, 45%, said their financial situation has stayed about the same.Groups likely to report doing better under Trump included men, those identifying as white, and those earning $80,000 or more annually.Covid-19 is only partly to blame. Three out of five of those surveyed said they failed to see any improvement in their personal wealth during Trump’s presidency, even before the coronavirus slammed the U.S., cratered the economy, and ate into stock market gains of the past three years.The benchmark S&P 500 index surged 58% from Trump’s election in 2016 to a record in February, when the start of the pandemic-induced recession began. The benchmark has since fallen 10%, while the jobless rate jumped as high as 14.7% in April from a 50-year low.“Despite low unemployment before the pandemic, income gains were slow in arriving during what we now understand was a 128-month long expansion,” said Mark Hamrick, senior economic analyst at Bankrate.com. “It has become more difficult to climb the wealth ladder in our country.”About 42% of those surveyed rated Trump’s overall handling of the economy negatively while 35% say he’s done a good or very good job.Potential voters were almost evenly divided on which 2020 presidential candidate would be the better bet for their financial future. Trump and Democrat Joe Biden each got a bit more than a third of the support from those surveyed. The rest said neither candidate would be better, or they didn’t know.Just 35% of those who say their finances have been negatively impacted by the Covid-19 outbreak think their financial situations will improve by November’s election.The survey of 1,343 adults was conducted June 3-4 by YouGov Plc. No margin of error was specified.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-americans-say-wealth-hasn-t-improved-during-trump-years/story-vLNRiaHGDhJhljW3JtgEKJ.html
14-06-2020||World||Coronavirus: Europe reopens many borders, shuts out Americans, Asians||Europe is taking a big step toward a new normality as many countries open borders to fellow Europeans after three months of coronavirus lockdowns — but even though Europeans love their summer vacations, it’s not clear how many are ready to travel again.Tourists from the U.S., Asia, Latin America and the Middle East will just have to wait for now. Europe is expected to start opening up to some visitors from elsewhere next month, but details remain unclear.The European Union home affairs commissioner, Ylva Johansson, told member nations last week that they “should open up as soon as possible” and suggested Monday was a good date.Many countries are doing just that, allowing travel from the EU, Britain and the rest of Europe’s usually passport-free Schengen travel area, which includes non-EU countries like Switzerland.Europe’s reopening won’t be a repeat of the chaotic free-for-all in March when panicked, uncoordinated border closures caused traffic jams that stretched for miles. Still, it’s a complicated, shifting patchwork of different rules. And although tourist regions are desperately counting on them, a lot of Europeans may decide to stay close to home this summer.That’s something tourism-dependent Mediterranean countries such as Greece are keen to avoid. Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged Saturday that “a lot will depend on whether people feel comfortable to travel and whether we can project Greece as a safe destination.”Greece has emphasized its handling of its outbreak, which saw only 183 deaths. Overall, Europe has seen more than 182,000 virus-linked deaths this year, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University that also shows Europe has had 2.04 million of the world’s 7.8 million infections.Hard-hit Spain, which on Sunday moved forward its opening to European travelers by 10 days to June 21, is allowing thousands of Germans to fly to its Balearic Islands for a trial run starting Monday — waiving its 14-day quarantine for the group.“This pilot program will help us learn a lot for what lies ahead in the coming months,” Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said. “We want our country, which is already known as a world-class tourist destination, to be recognized as also a secure destination.”Border checks in some places have already wound down. Italy opened its borders on June 3 and towns on the German-Polish border celebrated early Saturday as Poland opened the gates. At midnight, the mayors of Goerlitz, Germany and Zgorzelec, Poland cut through chains on a makeshift fence that had divided the towns.Germany, like France and others, is lifting remaining border checks on Monday and scrapping a requirement that arrivals must prove they have a good reason to enter. It also is easing a worldwide warning against nonessential travel to exempt European countries – except, probably, Finland, Norway and Spain, where travel restrictions remain, and Sweden, where the level of new coronavirus infections is deemed too high.Many German regions have reimposed a quarantine requirement for arrivals from Sweden, whose virus strategy avoided a lockdown but produced a relatively high death rate.Czech authorities will require arrivals from Sweden to show a negative COVID-19 test or to self-quarantine – along with travelers from Portugal and Poland’s Silesia region.Austria is opening up Tuesday to European neighbors except Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Britain — and keeping a travel warning for Italy’s worst-hit region of Lombardy. France is asking people from Britain to self-quarantine for two weeks.Britain recently introduced a 14-day quarantine requirement for most arrivals, to the horror of its tourism and aviation industries, which say the move will hit visits to Britain hard this summer.Denmark is opening up only for tourists from Germany, Norway and Iceland — and only if they can prove that they’re staying for at least six nights. Norway also is keeping shut its long border with Sweden.“I realize this is a big disappointment. But the restrictions are based on objective criteria that are the same for everyone,” Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg said. “If we open too quickly, the infection can get out of control.”With flights only gradually picking up, nervousness about new outbreaks abroad, uncertainty about social distancing at tourist venues and many people facing unemployment or pay cuts, this may be a good summer for domestic tourism.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz are both planning to vacation in their homelands this year.“The recommendation is still, if you want to be really safe, a vacation in Austria,” Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg told ORF television, recalling the scramble in March to bring home thousands of tourists as borders slammed shut. “In Austria, you know that you don’t have to cross a border if you want to get home, and you know the infrastructure and the health system well.”The German government, which helped fly 240,000 people home as the pandemic grew exponentially, also has no desire to repeat that experience.“My appeal to all those who travel: Enjoy your summer vacation — but enjoy it with caution and responsibility,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said. “In the summer holidays, we want to make it as difficult as possible for the virus to spread again in Europe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-europe-reopens-many-borders-shuts-out-americans-asians/story-ftezYQdxGjohmCChC1aGRI.html
14-06-2020||World||Donald Trump’s rally dangerous move in coronavirus age, high health risk: Experts||After months away from the campaign trail, President Donald Trump plans to rally his supporters this coming Saturday for the first time since most of the country was shuttered by the coronavirus. Trump will head to Tulsa, Oklahoma — a state that has seen relatively few COVID-19 cases.But health experts question the decision, citing the danger of infection spreading among the crowd and sparking outbreaks when people return to their homes. The Trump campaign itself acknowledges the risk in a waiver attendees must agree to absolving them of any responsibility should people get sick.WHAT MAKES THE RALLY HIGH RISK?Trump’s rally will be held indoors, at a 19,000-seat arena that has canceled all other events through the end of July. Scientists believe the virus spreads far more easily in crowded enclosed spaces than it does outdoors, where circulating air has a better chance of dispersing virus particles.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention outlines the highest risk events for transmission of the coronavirus this way: “Large in-person gatherings where it is difficult for individuals to remain spaced at least 6 feet apart and attendees travel from outside the local area.” The CDC recommends cloth masks in places where people might shout or chant.Trump’s rallies typically draw tens of thousands of supporters. They usually stand outside in line for hours before passing through airport-style security and cramming into an arena, where they sit side by side or stand shoulder to shoulder. The rallies are typically raucous, with much shouting, cheering and chanting. Some people dance and jeer at reporters. Sometimes protesters are met with violence before they are removed by security.Many attendees are older, which would put them at higher risk of severe complications from COVID-19. It’s not unusual for several individuals in the crowd to require medical attention when the temperature rises.The rallies also typically draw supporters from surrounding towns and states. Some die-hard fans travel across the country from rally to rally like groupies for a band.Dr. Ashish Jha, director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, called the upcoming Trump rally “an extraordinarily dangerous move for the people participating and the people who may know them and love them and see them afterward.”Trump supporters coming from neighboring cities and states could carry the virus back home, Jha said. “I’d feel the same way if Joe Biden were holding a rally.”OKLAHOMA CASES LOW BUT RISINGIn its final phase of reopening, Oklahoma now allows public gatherings of any size as long as organizers consider social distancing. Participants at any large gathering should stay 6 feet (1.8 meters) apart and wear a cloth face covering when distancing is a challenge, the state health department said.The state has a relatively low death rate compared with the rest of the nation, but new cases are rising. In Tulsa, cases are increasing, with 71 new cases reported Friday. The Tulsa Health Department already was investigating an outbreak linked to an indoor gathering of a large group of people.“I have concerns about large groups of people gathering indoors for prolonged lengths of time,” Bruce Dart, executive director of the Tulsa Health Department, said in a statement Friday. “It is imperative that anyone who chooses to host or attend a gathering take the steps to stay safe.”Dart said the risk of spreading the virus increases with higher numbers of people congregating for longer periods of time.Oklahoma health authorities said that anyone who attends a large public event should get tested for COVID-19 shortly afterward.Shelley Payne, director of the LaMontagne Center for Infectious Disease at the University of Texas at Austin, said the Trump rally meets every criteria for the riskiest type of event.“I would certainly recommend that people wear masks and try to keep as much distance as possible,” Payne said.Julie Fischer, an associate research professor of microbiology and immunology at Georgetown University, said the event could have wide repercussions for the country.“With a little bad luck, that scenario could end in the seeding of community outbreaks of COVID-19 across the U.S.,” she said.MASKS AND PRECAUTIONSThe Trump campaign has declined to respond to repeated questions about whether it will require attendees to wear masks, socially distance or take other measures to reduce the risk of virus transmission.Trump has made clear that he believes empty seats are bad optics. “I can’t imagine a rally where you have every fourth seat full. Every — every six seats are empty for every one that you have full. That wouldn’t look too good,” he said in April.Trump also insisted that the marquee event of the Republican National Convention — his acceptance of his party’s nomination for reelection — be moved from Charlotte, North Carolina, to Jacksonville, Florida, after North Carolina’s Democratic governor refused to promise he would not impose restrictions.Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, a former neurosurgeon, said Trump’s rallies will be coordinated with public health authorities to maintain safety.“As far as the virus is concerned, we have two choices: we can allow it to dominate us, or we can learn as much as we can about it and we can learn how to live with it in a safe, prescribed manner,” he said Sunday on Fox News. “And I think the second option is the one that’s going to be adopted.”WHY NOW?Trump has been eager to resume the rallies that are the centerpiece of his campaign. The president revels in his large crowds. The events let him vent and gauge the kind of rhetoric that will appeal to his ardent political base. They also help his campaign expand its voter databases and will serve as a contrast to Democratic challenger Biden, who has suspended campaign events because of the virus and hasn’t attracted the same size of crowds.But the decision to pull the trigger now was driven, in large part, by the mass anti-racism protests that have taken place across the country in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis. Campaign and White House officials say the protests — and the limited public health outcry they generated — gave them cover. If it was OK for tens of thousands of people to march through the streets, demanding racial justice, why can’t Trump rally his supporters, too?Of course, the protests were held outside, with many participants wearing masks.“Any large gathering, whether of protesters or ralliers, is dangerous,” Jha said. But infection is less likely at an outdoors moving march than at a crowded event in an enclosed space, he said, citing the air flow.THE WAIVERThe Trump campaign, in recognition of the risk, has tried to protect itself from lawsuits with waiver language on its registration website.“By clicking register below, you are acknowledging that an inherent risk of exposure to COVID-19 exists in any public place where people are present,” the campaign advised those signing up for the rally. “By attending the Rally, you and any guests voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19 and agree not to hold Donald J. Trump for President, Inc.” liable for illness or injury.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-rally-dangerous-move-in-coronavirus-age-high-health-risk-experts/story-fTljZPrF32XYcYTeTT3cUI.html

14-06-2020||World||World War I to 1999 WTO trade protests: Why Seattle has a history of protests||Large protests in Seattle over police brutality and racial injustice have again caught the nation’s eye, but big, unruly demonstrations have been part of the city since shortly after it was founded in 1851 by settlers in a log cabin on a lonely strip of land along the Puget Sound.Demonstrators this week staked out several blocks near downtown Seattle after officers withdrew from a police station following violent confrontations. They named it the “Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone,” demanded broad reforms and have faced blowback from President Donald Trump, who called them anarchist occupiers.Similar descriptions of Seattle protests have been used for more than 100 years, stretching from large labor movements before World War I to the massive 1999 WTO trade protests.“Seattle went from log cabin to the Space Needle in a very short period of time,” said Knute Berger, a local writer and historian. Large demonstrations here have been national news since the Wobblies — the Industrial Workers of the World labor union — were active in the area around World War I, Berger said.The city’s reputation as a hub of protest was sealed by the huge Seattle workers strike in 1919, when tens of thousands of workers walked out for days to demand better wages and conditions. For decades, Seattle has often been synonymous with unrest, especially for critics of social change, Berger said.“Back in the ‘30s, we were considered ‘the Soviet of Seattle.’ After WTO, the word was used as, well, ‘We don’t want another Seattle.’”Mayor Jenny Durkan addressed the city’s history with social movements this week when discussing the autonomous zone, noting that the quirky Seattle neighborhood has for decades been a hub for movements like gay rights and other social issues.“I’ve been going to Capitol Hill for almost 50 years,” Durkan told reporters Thursday. “I just want to say, I know there has been an acronym that it’s now the ‘Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone.’ I’ve got news for people. It’s been autonomous my whole life.”In the Vietnam era, the Seattle Liberation Front was one of the most high-profile anti-war groups in the nation. Federal officials accused some members of trying to incite riots.More recently, it was the 1999 WTO protests that garnered Seattle worldwide attention. City officials had hoped the meeting of the international trade regulation group would be a coming out party of sorts for the fast-growing tech hub.But the city was overwhelmed by tens of thousands of people upset over what they saw as the inequities of capitalism and the exploitation of workers. Some black-clad anarchists broke windows and vandalized stores, hundreds of people were arrested and the then-mayor declared a downtown curfew to quell the unrest.In the 20 years since the WTO protests, Seattle has seen explosive growth, with Amazon adding tens of thousands of workers near downtown and other tech behemoths expanding operations.That growth has led to soaring housing costs and an economic divide that Berger said are underlying the current demonstrations.“The issues of social justice and equity have increased because of this enormous disparity,” he said.And being one of America’s youngest cities allows people to use it as sort of a blank slate, Berger said, and encourages people to come who want to make big changes — whether in business, innovation or social areas.The city is also notoriously difficult to govern. It’s rare for mayors to be reelected as they often try to satisfy the diverse demands of a booming business sector, an active labor community and a strident social justice movement.On Capitol Hill, protester Mark Henry Jr. of Black Lives Matter said the current movement is broad and focused on change. But he said it incorporates many points of view.“Seattle is a very diverse community, it would take me a long time to represent our community,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-war-i-to-1999-wto-trade-protests-why-seattle-has-a-history-of-protests/story-P7NhWqaScfob2kPFgek49K.html
14-06-2020||World||Coronavirus tests in US, White House may not be accurate: Experts||How accurate are the coronavirus tests used in the U.S.?Months into the outbreak, no one really knows how well many of the screening tests work, and experts at top medical centers say it is time to do the studies to find out.When the new virus began spreading, the Food and Drug Administration used its emergency powers to OK scores of quickly devised tests, based mainly on a small number of lab studies showing they could successfully detect the virus.That’s very different from the large patient studies that can take weeks or months, which experts say are needed to provide a true sense of testing accuracy.The FDA’s speedy response came after it was initially criticized for delaying the launch of new tests during a crisis and after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stumbled in getting its own test out to states.But with the U.S. outbreak nearly certain to stretch on for months or even years, some experts want the FDA to demand better evidence of the tests’ accuracy so doctors know how many infections might be missed.There have been more than 2 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. and more than 115,000 deaths, according to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University. Cases in nearly half of U.S. states are rising.In recent weeks, preliminary findings have flagged potential problems with some COVID-19 tests, including one used daily at the White House. Faulty tests could leave many thousands of Americans with the incorrect assumption that they are virus-free, contributing to new flare-ups of the disease as communities reopen.“In the beginning, the FDA was under a lot of pressure to get these tests onto the marketplace,” said Dr. Steven Woloshin of Dartmouth College. “But now that there are plenty of tests out there, it’s time for them to raise the bar.”The FDA said in a statement that it has already asked multiple test makers to do follow-up accuracy studies, although it didn’t say for how many of the more than 110 authorized screening tests. The agency also said it is tracking reports of problems. Accuracy has also been an issue with blood tests that look for signs of past infections.No screening test is 100% accurate. So details on accuracy are routinely provided for tests of all types, including seasonal flu, hepatitis, HIV and cancers. For example, rapid flu tests are known to miss 20% or more of all cases, a factor doctors weigh when treating patients who have symptoms but test negative.For now, most COVID-19 tests in the U.S. don’t give data on real-world performance, including how often the tests falsely clear patients of infection or falsely detect the virus. That information is lacking for all but a few of the roughly 80 commercial screening tests available, according to an Associated Press review.The government’s emergency authorization process “requires a lower level of evidence,” the agency said. Makers need only show that a test “may be effective” instead of the usual requirement to demonstrate “safety and effectiveness.” They would have to meet that higher threshold once the U.S. government declares the emergency over.Many of the commercial test makers submitted results from 60 samples, the minimum number required and mostly used lab-produced specimens of the virus. The FDA now recommends the use of nasal swabs or other real samples from people screened for coronavirus.Experts say larger patient studies patients are needed to assess a test’s true performance.Lab testing bears little resemblance to actual — sometimes imperfect — conditions at hospitals, clinics and testing sites noted Dr. Robert Kaplan of Stanford University.“You’re testing people in parking lots, the patients themselves are extremely anxious and often unable to follow instructions,” said Kaplan, a former associate director of the National Institutes of Health.Kaplan and others say those differences could explain why some tests are not performing as expected.Last month, the FDA warned doctors of a potential accuracy problem with Abbott Laboratories’ rapid ID Now test, which delivers results in roughly 15 minutes. The test has been lauded by President Donald Trump and used to screen the president, his staff and visitors to the White House.The FDA alert followed a preliminary report by New York University that found Abbott’s test missed between a third to one-half of infections caught by a rival test in patients screened for the virus.Abbott rejected the findings, saying the researchers did not follow the instructions for using its test. The company pointed to alternate patient studies, including its own, that have found the test successfully detects between 91% and 95% or more of virus cases when compared to other tests.But similar problems with ID NOW’s accuracy have been flagged in preliminary reports by researchers at Stanford University, Loyola University and the Cleveland Clinic.For now, the FDA is requiring Abbott to conduct follow-up studies in several different patient groups.The FDA’s emergency standards “are still high but there is a significant difference in the body of work that what would go into a submission under the normal process,” said Abbott vice president John Hackett. “Our normal process takes years to bring these out.”Requiring bigger studies of all coronavirus tests could provide valuable information, but it could also strain the FDA’s already stretched staff and resources, said Dr. Daniel Schultz, former director of the FDA’s medical device center.Dr. Colin West of the Mayo Clinic worries doctors and patients have put too much confidence in the current crop of tests, when an unknown number of patients with COVID-19 are likely receiving false negative results.Even a modest error rate can have grave consequences during an outbreak like COVID-19. West gives the example of a test that is 95% accurate at detecting the virus and is used on 1 million people. That would still result in 50,000 people being incorrectly told that they don’t have the virus.“The negative test does not mean that I’m off the hook,” West said. “We just need to maintain that level of vigilance until we have a better sense of how good these tests really can be.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-tests-in-us-white-house-may-not-be-accurate-experts/story-vbf4L0WqWywrbIJfq433NI.html
14-06-2020||World||Mass virus testing in Beijing after new cluster triggers lockdowns||Beijing carried out mass testing for the coronavirus on Sunday after a new outbreak in the city that prompted travel warnings across the country amid fears of a resurgence of the disease.The deadly contagion had been brought largely under control in China through strict lockdowns that were imposed early this year but have since been lifted.But a fresh cluster linked to a wholesale food market in the capital has sparked widespread alarm and raised the spectre of a return to painful restrictions.The National Health Commission (NHC) reported 57 new infections on Sunday, of which 36 were local transmissions in Beijing, all linked to the Xinfadi market.Another two domestic infections were in northeastern Liaoning province and were close contacts of the Beijing cases.The 19 other infections were among Chinese nationals returning from abroad.Liaoning was among several provinces to advise residents against travelling to Beijing due to the new outbreak -- along with cities such as nearby Tianjin and several in Hebei province, which surrounds Beijing.Some local authorities said people entering from Beijing would have to quarantine, state media reported.In the capital, lockdowns have been imposed on a very small part of the city that includes 11 residential estates near the market which supplies most of the city’s fresh produce.Officials said Sunday they planned to carry out virus tests on 46,000 residents in the area surrounding the market and had set up 24 testing stations.Everyone who works at Xinfadi also has to undergo testing.So far 10,881 people have been tested in the area with another eight cases diagnosed on Sunday. They were not included in the NHC’s tally earlier in the day that covered the previous 24 hours.“I went to Xinfadi market so I want to confirm that I am not infected,” a 32-year-old woman surnamed Guo told AFP as she queued in scorching heat at a stadium waiting for a virus test.“We were told that after the tests... if it is positive, we will be taken directly to the hospital.”- Lockdowns and closures -One of Sunday’s new cases was a 56-year-old man who works as an airport bus driver and had visited the Xinfadi market in early June before later falling ill, state-run People’s Daily reported.The meat section of the huge, sprawling market was closed Sunday and AFP reporters saw hundreds of police officers and security personnel plus dozens of paramilitary police blocking access.Efforts to trace those who had visited the market have begun, with companies and neighbourhood communities messaging staff and residents across the city to ask about their recent movements.A vegetable market adjacent to Xinfadi was open Sunday and trucks were arriving to deliver or collect stock.“Afraid? Not really” a delivery driver surnamed Zhang told AFP. “But anyway I have no choice -- I am part of the lowest class of society. So I have to keep working in order to make a living.”In nearby streets, residents were under lockdown and restaurants closed.Some people used a wooden stepladder propped against the gated entrance to one community to pass supplies to loved ones.A resident surnamed Chen told AFP he had made several trips with his car to the front gate of his compound to deliver food. “As soon as I finish delivering the supplies to my family members, I will go upstairs to join them,” he said.“After that I won’t be able to get out.”- Food fears -Covid-19 first emerged late last year and one of the first clusters was from a market in the central city of Wuhan that sold wild animals for meat.The latest outbreak in Beijing has turned the spotlight on the hygiene of the city’s food supply chain.State-run media reported that the virus was detected on chopping boards used to handle imported salmon, and that major supermarkets had removed the fish from their stocks.Beijing authorities ordered a city-wide food safety inspection focusing on fresh and frozen meat, poultry and fish in supermarkets, warehouses and catering services.One trader surnamed Sun, selling tomatoes and cherries at a central food market, told AFP there were fewer customers than normal.“People are scared,” he said. City authorities have closed nine schools and kindergartens near Xinfadi, while sporting events and cross-provincial tour groups have been stopped.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mass-virus-testing-in-beijing-after-new-cluster-triggers-lockdowns/story-vzlfgswxfwkDXk44RYmr7H.html
14-06-2020||World||Rishi Sunak speaks out on racist abuse as child growing up in UK||UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak on Sunday spoke out about the racist abuse he faced as a child growing up in Britain, but stressed that the country has made enormous progress over time.The Indian-origin finance minister, who was born in the UK, revealed that the abuse felt far worse when it occurred in the presence of his younger siblings, as he was asked to comment on another set of far-right and antiracism protests in London over the weekend.“It’s the sort of thing that’s happening on your own it’s difficult enough but when I had my younger brother and sister with me at the time it was particularly upsetting; I wanted to protect them from it,” he told Sky News, when asked about his experience of racist abuse.“They may just be words, but they sting in a way that other things don’t… There is something about that [racist abuse] that cuts to your core,” he said.The minister stressed that violent clashes, of the kind seen during some protests in London on Saturday, were “both shocking and disgusting” and those responsible should face tough legal consequences.He said: “This has always been an open, and tolerant country and what we saw yesterday was not that. There will always be a small minority who maintain prejudice, and indeed are racist, but that is not overall the description I would ascribe to our country.“I think there’s been enormous progress that our country and our society has made if I think back to the time when my grandparents first arrived, when I was growing up.” Sunak, who is leading the UK’s economic response to the coronavirus pandemic, went on to encourage people to support the reopening of the country’s high streets from Monday when non-essential retail stores are allowed to reopen under Covid-secure conditions. The minister indicated that the government was reviewing the current two-metre social distance norm in order to assist businesses further.“People need to have the confidence that it’s safe... and I can give that assurance,” he said, in reference to the next phase of the easing of the UK’s lockdown from Monday.“The PM has put in place a comprehensive review of the two-metre rule. We keep everything under review... I can very much understand the positive impact it will have on businesses in being able to open,” he said.The senior Cabinet minister once again admitted “hardship” in store as steps unfold towards restarting the economy after months of lockdown imposed in the wake of the deadly virus, which has claimed over 41,000 lives in the UK.“I think, primarily, we need to reopen our economy safely and slowly, and that’s the most important thing, to try and safeguard as many of those jobs as possible. But then as I look forward, acknowledge that there is going to be hardship ahead. People are going to lose their jobs,” he said.“I want to make sure that we have the degree of support for them, whether it’s skills or other support, to help them get back into work. I want to make sure companies are encouraged to employ people,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-speaks-out-on-racist-abuse-as-child-growing-up-in-uk/story-4uO1qgwblfV08mhnQjHlrK.html

But France will apply different rules to visitors from Spain and Britain because those countries established different reopening schedules.France will gradually allow visitors from outside Europe starting July 1, based on the virus situation in countries of origin.The French government promised to ease entry for foreign students in particular ahead of the new academic year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-to-end-border-lockdown-open-up-to-europe/story-Lh5fbIC0ceIoSb1ICtvmsM.html
14-06-2020||World||Another African-American man killed by police amid ongoing antiracism protests||As the United States continued to mourn the death of George Floyd and protest against racism in law enforcement agencies, it found itself confronting the urgency of the issue as public anger erupted Saturday in Atlanta, Georgia over the killing of another African American man by a white police officer.Protestors blocked a major interstate highway and set fire to popular fast-food chain restaurant as outrage grew untempered by the swift resignation of the Atlanta police chief and the firing of the police officer who had fatally shot Rayshard Brooks, the black man, on Friday night.The police had found Brooks, a 27-year-old father of three, sleeping in his car in the drive-through of Wendy’s, a fast food chain. He failed a sobriety test and in an ensuing struggle with two officers snatched a Taser and was shot trying to flee, according to Georgia state investigators.Police chief Erika Shields announced a resignation within hours and Garett Wolfe, the officer who is alleged to have to shot Brooks, has been fired.“While there may be debate whether this was an appropriate use of deadly force, I firmly believe there is a clear distinction between what you can do and what you should do,” Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms said at a news conference at which she also announced Shields’ resignation. “I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force and have called for the immediate termination of the officer.”The Atalanta shooting came three weeks after George Floyd, a 46-year African American father of five children, died under the knee of a white police officer in Minneapolis, triggering countrywide protests and an intense debate on the need for urgent police reforms to root out racism.Several demonstrators turned up outside West Point, the elite academy in New York for future US military leaders where President Donald Trump gave the commencement address at an in-person event in the middle of escalating differences with US military leaders. They carried signs and chanted slogans.Trump did not mention Brooks in his speech, but alluded to the context of the protests following the death of Floyd. “It was this school that gave us the men who fought and won a bloody war to extinguish the evil of slavery within one lifetime of our founding,” the president said.Trump recently shut down a move by the Pentagon to rename Army bases named after generals of the confederacy of states that had seceded from the United States and fought its army, and lost, from 1861 to 1865 to protect slavery and continue white supremacy. There are 10 such bases.But statutes of confederate figures — and others, going back to Christopher Columbus — continue to be toppled around the country. Protestors pulled down a statue Saturday of John McDonogh, a wealthy 19th century slaveowner in Louisiana, loaded the torn down part on two two trucks and dumped them in the Mississippi River.Newsrooms across the country have felt the impact of the continuing and growing protests on the streets. Several top editors and executives have faced scrutiny and punishment. There is no word yet about those responsible at Fox News, an unabashed conservative news channel and supporter of President Trump, for using a digitally altered picture of Seattle protests, which has since been taken down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-african-american-man-killed-by-police-amid-ongoing-antiracism-protests/story-ZuKkk36GqvihKGe8PZTHuO.html
14-06-2020||World||Covid-19: UK records lowest death toll of 36, shops set to reopen||The United Kingdom on Sunday registered the lowest day-rise in the number of dead from coronavirus – 36 – since lockdown on March 23, encouraging the Boris Johnson government to reopen non-essential shops with social distancing from Monday.The Department of Health said the cumulative figures of the dead was 41,698 (day rise of 36) and 295,889 cases (day rise of 1,514). The UK remains one of the worst hit countries by the coronavirus pandemic - there were nearly 1,000 day-deaths in April - but recent weeks have shown a decline.The Johnson government has been gradually reopening the economy, partly driven by the need to begin recovery amidst steep decline in GDP (20 per cent down in April). This, however, has prompted concern from public health experts that the threat from the virus remains.The decline in deaths and positive cases has been the sharpest in London, which was a hotbed in March and April. Mayor Sadiq Khan cautioned the people that the lockdown has not been lifted: “The virus is still out there…Stay at home as much as possible and avoid public transport”.Prime Minister Johnson visited the Westfield shopping centre in London on Sunday and said the government is reviewing the two-metre distancing rule, which is central to shops and other establishment reopening as before.According to him, the current infection figures allowed for “more margin for manoeuvre” in easing the social distancing regulations, but he insisted this he would work “very closely with the scientists at all times” and the decision would be based on “safety, health, and stopping the disease”.He said: “As we get the numbers down, so it becomes one-in-a-thousand, one-in-sixteen hundred, maybe fewer, your chances of being, two metres one metre or even a foot away from somebody who has the virus are obviously going down statistically, so you start to build some more margin for manoeuvre, and we’ll be looking at that and keeping it under constant review.”The people, he added, should be able to “shop with confidence” when non-essential stores reopen in England on Monday, hoping that there would be a “gradual” increase in the numbers of people returning to the high street.He said: “I am very optimistic about the opening up that is going to happen tomorrow. I think people should shop and shop with confidence, but they should of course observe the rules on social distancing and do it as safely as possible”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-records-lowest-death-toll-of-36-shops-set-to-reopen/story-a1zqwNNy4sp5vzTIv3P24J.html
14-06-2020||World||China’s Sinovac says its coronavirus vaccine showed positive results in trials||Chinese vaccine-maker Sinovac Biotech has announced “positive preliminary” results of phase I and II clinical trials for its Covid-19 vaccine candidate, CoronaVac, saying it can induce a positive immune response.The phase I/II clinical trials was designed as randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled studies. In total, 743 healthy volunteers, aged from 18 to 59 years old, enrolled in the trials. Of those, 143 volunteers are in phase I and 600 volunteers are in phase II, the Beijing-based company said in a statement. The vaccine induced neutralising antibodies in “above 90 per cent” of people who were tested 14 days after receiving two injections, two weeks apart. There were no severe side effects reported, the company said in a statement. The company expects to submit a phase II clinical study report and a phase III clinical study protocol to China’s National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) soon and commence application of phase III clinical trials outside of China. Sinovac is collaborating with Instituto Butantan in Brazil to prepare and conduct a phase III clinical study. The company expects to share the full data on our clinical trials with the public through academic publications. Weidong Yin, Chairman, President and CEO of Sinovac, said, “Our phase I/II study shows CoronaVac is safe and can induce an immune response. “Concluding our phase I/II clinical studies with these encouraging results is another significant milestone we have achieved in the fight against Covid-19,” Weidong said.“We have started to invest in building a manufacturing facility so that we can maximize the number of doses available to protect people from Covid-19. Like with our other vaccines, we are committed to developing CoronaVac for global use as part of our mission of supplying vaccines to eliminate human diseases,” he said. Sinovac’s development of a vaccine against Covid-19 began in January 2020 in partnership with leading academic research institutes in China. The company received approval from China’s NMPA on April 13 to conduct phase I/II trials on its inactivated vaccine candidate against Covid-19 in China. There are currently more than two dozen research efforts underway to develop protective vaccines against the novel coronavirus that causes Covid-19. In May, Moderna, a Cambridge, Mass.-based biotech firm, announced early and encouraging immune-response results for its experimental Covid-19 vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-sinovac-says-its-coronavirus-vaccine-showed-positive-results-in-trials/story-LhrmyQENHVtkYrJzmHdlNL.html

14-06-2020||World||At 44, Beijing sees sharpest rise in Covid-19 cases||China on Sunday reported 44 new Covid-19 cases in Beijing, the sharpest rise in the capital since the outbreak began last year, triggering fears of the second wave in a country that had efficiently reduced infection numbers even as the pandemic rages globally.Majority of the cases have been linked to the sprawling Xinfadi wholesale market – the biggest in Beijing – for vegetables, meat and seafood in the southwest of the city in the Fengtai district: the infected are either traders or buyers who visited the market.Beijing had reported six new domestically transmitted cases for Friday, and one for Thursday, leading local authorities to swing back into anti-epidemic mode on a “wartime” footing.The capital, a city of around 21 million residents, had lowered its emergency level to the lowest level earlier this month.The sudden spurt in cases in the city, home to the political elite of the Communist Party of China (CPC), is a reminder that no fresh cases even for 55 days -- as was the case in Beijing -- doesn’t mean that the virus threat has been eradicated.Two more domestic cases were reported from northeast China’s Liaoning province, the National Health Commission (NHC) said in its daily briefing on Sunday.Nineteen of 57 cases recorded on Sunday were imported cases, the NHC said with 17 of them reported in the southern province of Guangdong – they were all on a flight from Dhaka in Bangladesh to Guangzhou, the capital of the province.In Beijing, the city government said they were out to control the new cluster infection on “war footing”.“Beijing has entered a critical period,” Xu Hejian, a Beijing government spokesperson said at a briefing Sunday.The city has ordered testing of anyone linked to the Xinfadi market, after the district containing the market put itself on a “wartime” footing.Beijing shuttered tourist spots and suspended sports events scheduled for the week amid the new infections.Many schools, which had reopened in a staggered fashion in the last couple of weeks are expected to be shut down again.Thousands of workers and residents around the Xinfadi market were lining up for nucleic acid tests on Sunday – the government has directed that anyone who had visited the market May 30 onwards should head to the nearest of the 98 testing clinics to get the testing done.Besides shuttering the market, where coronavirus traces were discovered in imported salmon, authorities have launched closed-off management over 11 residential compounds in the vicinity of the Xinfadi market.Beijing health authority spokesperson Gao Xiaojun has said anyone in the city with a fever will be given nucleic-acid and serology tests for the coronavirus, a blood test and a CT scan.Medical facilities are not allowed to turn away patients with fever symptoms, Gao said.At least 10 cities, including Harbin and Dalian in the northeast of China, have urged residents not to travel to Beijing and to report to authorities if they have done so recently.More than 1,500 tonnes of seafood, 18,000 tonnes of vegetables and 20,000 tonnes of fruit are traded at the market daily, according to the state-controlled Beijing News.The total number of Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 83,140 while the death toll has remained unchanged at 4634 for weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-44-beijing-sees-sharpest-rise-in-covid-19-cases/story-LQaqXZvSWAiZm8hf6wpKZN.html

14-06-2020||World||Russia’s low virus death toll still raises questions in West||When Leonid Shlykov’s father, Sergei, died in a Moscow hospital last month after 11 days on a ventilator, the death certificate listed the coronavirus as an underlying condition but not the actual cause of death.“Yes, he was suffering from impaired kidney function and diabetes, but if it hadn’t been for Covid-19, he would’ve been alive,” the son wrote on Facebook. “If we had known the real number of infections and deaths … it would have helped us make the decision to hospitalize (dad) earlier.”The way Russia counts fatalities during the coronavirus pandemic could be one reason why its official death toll of 6,948 is far below many other countries, even as it has reported nearly 529,000 infections, behind only the United States and Brazil.The paradox also has led to allegations by critics and Western media that Russian authorities might have falsified the numbers for political purposes to play down the scale of the outbreak. Even a top World Health Organization official said the low number of deaths in Russia “certainly is unusual.”Russian authorities have bristled at the suggestions.“We have never manipulated the official statistics,” said Deputy Prime Minister Tatyana Golikova.Finding the true numbers during the pandemic is difficult, since countries count cases and deaths in different ways and testing for the virus is uneven.Still, several factors could contribute to Russia’s low virus mortality rate, including the way it counts deaths, a tendency among some officials to embellish statistics, its vast geography and the shorter life expectancy of its population.An autopsy is mandatory in Russia in every confirmed or suspected case of Covid-19, with a determination on the cause of death made by a commission of specialists, said Dr. Natalia Belitchenko, a pathologist in the medical examiner’s office in the region around St. Petersburg.She deals with coronavirus deaths almost daily, but said only about 20% of them have been attributed to Covid-19. In other cases, the virus was determined to be an underlying condition.“In the vast majority of cases, the pneumonia itself wouldn’t have led to death, had the underlying conditions not flared up to a point of becoming fatal,” she told The Associated Press.Unlike Russia, some countries’ official death count includes those who had Covid-19 but died from other causes, said Dr. Michael Ryan, executive director of the WHO Health Emergencies Program.“It will be important that the Russian authorities review the way in which death certification is done to reassure themselves that they are accurately certifying deaths in the appropriate way,” he said.Death counts vary around the world because countries underreported the number of Covid-19 deaths early on, said Ali Mokdad, professor at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. They ascribed virus deaths to other causes due to insufficient testing or initially only counted deaths in hospitals, he added.Some countries also are overcounting by including “presumptive deaths” — those who likely died of Covid-19 but were never tested for it, Mokdad said.What sets Russia apart, however, is a habit of obscuring embarrassing truths, said Judy Twigg, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University and senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.The way mortality data is recorded in Russia is affected by a Soviet-era tradition of setting future targets for improving public health through efforts to reduce mortality from certain reasons, such as alcoholism or tuberculosis.Health officials “shift the way they code causes of death in order to try to meet those targets,” Twigg said.Pathologists told AP there is pressure from hospital administrators to produce better-looking reports.Requests and instructions to obscure certain causes of death in postmortems are “an inevitable part of our job,” said a pathologist in Siberia who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to reporters.Data analysts say inconsistencies in Russia’s virus statistics suggest manipulation, such as regions reporting similar numbers of new cases for several days in a row, or the number of deaths in regional reports differing from those in federal reports.“I don’t trust official statistics, and I believe I have reasons not to,” Boris Ovchinnikov, director of the Moscow-based Data Insight research agency, told the AP. “But we don’t have any good alternative indicators for assessing the real situation.”Among the anomalies:— The governor of the Lipetsk region in southwestern Russia was recorded telling subordinates last month that “numbers need to be changed, otherwise our region will be judged poorly.”— In the Altai region in southern Siberia, a task force posted a daily infection update containing the words “for approval” addressed to the provincial governor. It quickly erased the words after it was reported on social media.— Unusual spikes in pneumonia deaths indicate possibility more virus deaths than officially reported by mid-May: St. Petersburg reported 694 pneumonia deaths, with 63 from coronavirus; the North Caucasus republic of Dagestan reported 657 pneumonia deaths and 29 from coronavirus.“Without doubt, there have been manipulations with statistics on the regional level,” said Gleb Pavlovsky, an independent analyst and former Kremlin political consultant, adding that it seems they did it “on their own initiative.”At the same time, he noted that a decrease in cases was a key factor for holding two big events on the Kremlin agenda that were postponed by the virus: a massive Red Square parade for the 75th anniversary of the victory in World War II and a vote on constitutional amendments that could extend President Vladimir Putin’s rule until 2036.Citing a slowdown in infections, Putin ordered the parade for June 24 and the vote for July 1. Most regions, including Moscow, also recently lifted tight lockdowns imposed in March even though daily numbers of new infections have remained high, hovering around 9,000.In a bid to dispel claims of underreporting mortality, the government released updated statistics for April showing patients who died of other causes while testing positive for the virus, as well as those who tested negative but likely died of it.If those were counted as coronavirus deaths, mortality would have been 60% higher than announced. Authorities insist they shouldn’t be included in the official toll, but even if all extra deaths recently reported by federal and Moscow officials were added, it would still be around 11,000.Russian officials credit early quarantine measures and quick expansion of hospital capacity that prevented the health care system from being overwhelmed. They also cite more than 14 million tests that helped spot asymptomatic cases that account for more than 40% of all recent infections in the country of 146.7 million.Officials noted that infections in Russia peaked later than in Europe, and deaths are now climbing more quickly.Experts say Russia’s statistical gaps may result from its outdated system of collecting mortality data: In many regions, a death certificate must be delivered by a relative to a local civil registry office. Many of those offices were closed or had limited hours due to coronavirus lockdowns.“So what we’re seeing now is insufficient data in many regions,” said Alexei Raksha, an independent demographer.He said data from civil registries he studied showed that some regions reported fewer deaths in April than in previous years. Deaths were five times lower in the southern republic of Ingushetia, while in Krasnodar, they fell by about 1,500 from the monthly average, a record low.“Some people just bury their relatives without going to the civil registration office,” Raksha said.Researchers expect most of these gaps to be filled in next year, when the Russian State Statistics Service issues its annual report.Raksha said Russia’s few virus deaths could also be due to less-frequent travel across the vast country, its low population density and lower social mobility. He also said because the country has a much lower life expectancy than the West, it has fewer elderly targets for the virus.___Follow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-s-low-virus-death-toll-still-raises-questions-in-west/story-DEaMrbRNawHnaRs3XDRnSO.html
14-06-2020||World||UN chief extends telecommuting at world body’s headquarters until July 31||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has extended the telecommuting arrangements at the world body’s headquarters in New York until July 31 in view of the social distancing measures and restrictions due to the coronavirus pandemic. He said that the UN premises will be re-opened for diplomats, staff and journalists in four phases. Guterres, in a letter to the UN staff members on Saturday, said that after consulting with the senior management and “our medical services regarding the Covid-19 situation, I have decided to extend the current telecommuting arrangements at the headquarters complex through July 31, 2020. “We will continue to review these arrangements and will provide advance notice should there be any easing or further extension of these measures”. According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the contagion has infected over 77,00,000 people and killed more than 4,30,000 across the world. The US is the worst affected country with over 2.07 million cases and more than 1,15,000 deaths. The Covid-19, which originated in China’s Wuhan city in December last year, has also battered the world economy with the International Monetary Fund saying that the global economy is bound to suffer a “severe recession”. Scientists are racing against time to find a vaccine or medicine for its treatment. Telecommuting was implemented at the UN headquarters from March 16 as the Covid-19 cases were increasing steadily in the state and the arrangements have been extended periodically, keeping in mind the coronavirus situation on ground. New York has finally turned the tide and is now reporting record low number of hospitaliSations, daily infections and deaths. Guterres said that the personnel are actively preparing the UN buildings for a return in four phases. During the current phase (Phase Zero), the aim is to keep the footprint at the headquarters complex below 200 people – staff and delegates. The Department of Operational Support is doing a deep cleaning of the premises, placing signage around the buildings to guide staff on physical distancing and making other arrangements to lower the exposure risk for returning personnel and delegates, which is envisaged to start in Phase Two when the UN gradually moves from 10 to 40 per cent occupancy. While a date for Phase One has not yet been set, Guterres said that during the first phase, only those functions that need to be performed on site will be allowed and the vast majority of staff will continue to telecommute. In this phase, not more than 400 people would be allowed at the headquarters complex on any given day, and physical distancing will be strictly enforced for common spaces. The UNGA is gearing to conduct elections for the President of the 75th session of the UN General Assembly, non-permanent members of the Security Council and election of members of the Economic and Social Council, and has put in place special voting arrangements. The elections will be held simultaneously on June 17 from 9:00 AM (local time) in the General Assembly Hall. Eight time slots have been allocated to member states to cast their ballots in the General Assembly Hall, in adherence to the social distancing guidelines. UN General Assembly President Tijjani Muhammad-Bande has also recommended that Heads of State and Government and Ministers address the high-level General Assembly session in September through pre-recorded video statements as Covid-19-related restrictions on international travel and large in-person meetings are likely to be in place in the coming months. In a communication to the 193 UN member states last week, Muhammad-Bande said that the General Assembly should consider holding the General Debate and other meetings scheduled for the high-level week of the 75th session of the General Assembly “in a different format” since limitations on international travel and convening of large in-person meetings as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, may, in varying degrees, still be in effect in September. The new format will mean that it will be for the first time in the world organisation’s 75-year history that Heads of State and Government will not gather here for the high-level week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-extends-telecommuting-at-world-body-s-headquarters-until-july-31/story-SnQlFLaYUl5wRfXCB3BWJL.html

14-06-2020||World||100 years on, US state pardons man accused of rape tied to lynching||On June 15, 1920, three African-Americans were lynched in Duluth, Minnesota, accused without proof of raping a white woman. One hundred years later, the northern US state on Friday pardoned another black man convicted of the crime, which he repeatedly denied committing.Max Mason, who died in 1942, has become the first person to benefit from a posthumous pardon in Minnesota, a potent symbolic action at a time when Americans are confronting the roots of a racism that still taints substantial portions of society.The pardon request was filed well before the May 25 death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.The killing, caught on video, triggered coast-to-coast protests, making the Mason pardon timely.“100 years late, overdue justice has been done,” Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison said on Twitter.“The last weeks in MN have shown us we have a need for a better quality of justice. A pardon for Max Mason is another long-delayed step toward it.” On June 14 of 1920, young white woman Irene Tusken and a male friend attended the circus in Duluth. The next day, the man told his father they had been attacked by black circus troupe members and that Tusken was raped.Police rounded up and interrogated several black men including Mason, but the couple was unable to identify anyone as one of the attackers.According to court documents, a doctor examined the woman but could find no evidence of assault.Mason was released, and he rejoined the traveling circus as it departed Duluth. But police re-arrested him along with several other men. Later that night, an angry mob broke into the police station and grabbed three men, dragging them through the streets before hanging them in front of thousands of people.Duluth is the home town of famed folk singer Bob Dylan, whose 1965 song “Desolation Row” was written in part about the crime.The city has apologized for the lynching and in 2003 erected a memorial to the three victims.Mason escaped the fate of those three men. But he was sentenced to 30 years in prison, in part because it was learned that he and Tusken were both infected with gonorrhea, a common venereal disease.“If he had been a white man, I am rather doubtful if he would have been convicted,” county attorney Mason Forbes said in 1923 pardon request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/100-years-on-us-state-pardons-man-accused-of-rape-tied-to-lynching/story-zK1CJlVVpz2JCT06lG27ML.html

Waving banners with rainbows on them and sticking temporary rainbow tattoos on their cheeks, participants ran two routes through the city centre, ranging from 6 to 12 kilometres (4-7 miles). “Raise The Pride”, which will also include talks and workshops, runs from June 13 to 21 and coincides with similar events in other cities around the world for Pride month. “It’s my first time to join the Pride Run. I want to join because I am a cross-country racer in the school and I stand with equal rights as an LGBTQ member,” said Jacky Zhou, 16, as she prepared for the run.“I hope this running event can help us promote the power of the rainbow. I am so excited now and I hope I can finish it.”Social distancing restrictions, imposed due to the Covid-19 pandemic, have largely been lifted in Shanghai in recent months after a sharp drop in nationwide cases, although the capital Beijing is grappling with a new cluster of coronavirus infections.Homosexuality is legal in China and the country stopped classifying it as a mental disorder in 2001. However same-sex marriage is not recognised and concerns over stigma still dissuades people from coming out to their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eighth-annual-pride-run-kicks-off-in-shanghai/story-4oNSWrOiYP7i2nGy66wpJK.html

Ankara is providing military and diplomatic support to Libya’s United Nations-recognized administration, while Russia backs rival militia commander Khalifa Haftar. In Syria, the Russian-backed government aims to retake Idlib from Islamist militants, while Turkey has vowed to never let that happen.Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif will also be in Turkey June 14-15, according to a separate statement. “During the visit, all aspects of our bilateral relations will be discussed and views on regional and international issues will be exchanged,” the Turkish Foreign Ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-sends-ministers-to-turkey-amid-clash-over-syria-libya/story-VJU0IbokSPddLoTFnj4IjJ.html

Our #BlackLivesMatter banner shows our support for the fight against racial injustice and police brutality as we strive to be a more inclusive & just society,” the embassy tweeted on Saturday, along with the picture of the banner in black and white.주한미국대사관은 미국민들과 비통함을 함께 나누고 있으며 긍정적인 변화를 위한 평화로운 시위를 지지합니다. 대사관에 설치된 #BlackLivesMatter 배너는 인종 차별과 경찰 만행에 대한 항의이며 더욱 더 포용력 있고 정당한 사회를 향한 우리의 의지를 보여줍니다. pic.twitter.com/mWgJvgyaqEUS Ambassador to South Korea Harry Harris retweeted the message, adding “USA is a free and diverse nation... from that diversity we gain our strength.”Black Lives Matter protests are being held across the globe as part of campaigns focusing on social injustice following the death of George Floyd in police custody, but the banner is seen as a rare, open support for the protest by an appointee of President Donald Trump after Trump linked violent protests to “thugs.”No comment was immediately available from the embassy on Sunday.The embassy also made some waves last year when it displayed a rainbow banner in support of the LGBTQ community.Harris, a 40-year veteran of the US Navy who started in Seoul in 2018 after Trump appointed him, has privately said that he is planning on exiting his position before the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-embassy-in-seoul-displays-black-lives-matter-banner-in-support-of-anti-racism-protests/story-9FS3t2qXIe0mzpOl22wcbK.html
14-06-2020||World||Australian police arrest two after Captain Cook statue defaced||Australian police said they arrested two women after a statute of British explorer James Cook, captain of the first Western ship to reach the east coast of Australia, was defaced early on Sunday in Sydney.New South Wales police were alerted to graffiti on Cook’s statue in Hyde Park in the central district of Australia’s largest city just after 4 a.m. (2000 GMT on Saturday) before the two women in their late 20s were arrested. The women were found with a bag containing a number of spray-paint cans, the police said in a statement. They were refused bail and will be charged with the destroying and damaging property, it said. Anti-racism protesters, who have taken to the streets following the death of African American George Floyd in police custody, are demanding that the legacies of some of the architects of Europe’s empire building be revisited and their statues be torn down.From Cecil Rhodes in England to Christopher Columbus in the United States and King Leopold II in Belgium, statues of empire builders have been under attack in recent weeks around the world, sometimes from the descendants of those they once colonised.Cook’s statute was promptly cleaned by Sydney council workers on Sunday morning, a police spokeswoman said. Police in the neighbouring state of Victoria are also investigating the weekend defacing of the statues of two former Australian prime ministers at a Ballarat park.In New Zealand, thousands marched the streets of Auckland and Wellington chanting, “I can’t breathe” - a phrase the handcuffed Floyd repeated before dying as a white Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes.Protesters in Auckland carried Black Lives Matter signs and marched through the city’s central district towards the US consulate, chanting “Shame”, while Maori community members danced outside the building, the news website Stuff reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-police-arrest-two-after-captain-cook-statue-defaced/story-2PRa84wKPCjZfKLBnywNDP.html
14-06-2020||World||China, Korea, Egypt record rise in Covid cases as curbs on business, travel ease||China reported its highest daily total of new coronavirus cases in two months on Sunday and infections in South Korea also rose, showing how the disease can come back as curbs on business and travel are lifted.Meanwhile, Egypt reported its biggest daily increase on Saturday. Infections were rising in some US states as President Donald Trump pushed for businesses to reopen despite warnings by public health experts.China had 57 confirmed cases in the 24 hours through midnight Saturday, the National Health Commission reported. That was the highest since mid-April and included 36 in Beijing, the capital.The biggest wholesale food market in Beijing, a city of 20 million residents, was shut down Saturday after 50 people tested positive for the virus. They were the city’s first confirmed cases in 50 days.The world is seeing more than 100,000 newly confirmed cases every day, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.China, where the pandemic began in December, and other countries that suffered early on including South Korea, Italy and Spain have seen numbers of new infections decline. Brazil, India, the United States and other countries are seeing large increases.China responded to the outbreak with the world’s most intensive anti-disease controls, isolating cities with some 60 million people and shutting down much of its economy in steps that later were imitated by some other governments.The ruling Communist party eased most limits on business and travel after declaring victory over the disease in March. Some curbs still are in place including a ban on most foreign travelers arriving in the country.On Saturday, authorities in Beijing locked down 11 residential communities near the Xinfadi market. White fencing sealed off a road leading to apartment buildings and drivers were required to show identification to enter the area.South Korea’s government reported 34 more coronavirus cases, adding to an upward trend in infections.The Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 30 of the new cases were in the greater Seoul area, where half of the country’s 51 million people live. New cases have been linked to nightlife establishments, church services, a large-scale e-commerce warehouse and door-to-door sellers.The Egyptian Health Ministry announced 1,677 new confirmed cases. Egypt is the Arab world’s most populous country and has its highest coronavirus death toll. The country has reported 1,484 deaths and 42,980 confirmed cases.In the United States, the number of new cases in the southwestern state of Arizona has risen to more than 1,000 per day from fewer than 400 when the state’s shutdown was lifted in mid-May, according to an analysis by The Associated Press.Gov. Doug Ducey is not requiring Arizona residents to wear masks in public despite warnings by public health experts outside the government.Elsewhere, bar owners in New Orleans were preparing to reopen. San Francisco restaurants resumed outdoor seating Friday and the California government allowed hotels, zoos, museums and aquariums to reopen.The states of Utah and Oregon suspended further reopening of their economies due to a spike in cases.The latest Chinese cases raised the mainland’s total to 83.132, with 4,634 deaths, according to the Health Commission. South Korea has reported 12,085 cases and 277 deaths.Also Sunday, China’s air regulator announced China Southern Airlines was required to suspend flights between Dhaka, Bangladesh, and the southern city of Guangzhou for four weeks after 17 passengers on Thursday’s flight tested positive for the virus.Beijing allows each airline to make one flight per week on each route. Under rules announced June 4, a route will be suspended for one week if five passengers on a flight test positive and four weeks if the number rises to 10.In Europe, France’s highest administrative court ruled Saturday that virus concerns no longer justify banning public protests.The Council of State’s decision allows for demonstrations and marches as long as health protections are respected. Events must be declared in advance to local authorities and not deemed a risk to public order.The ruling came as an unauthorized protest against police violence and racial injustice wound down in Paris. Police had stopped at least 15,000 protesters from a planned march through the city Saturday, citing virus-related restrictions on any gathering of more than 10 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-korea-egypt-record-rise-in-covid-cases-as-curbs-on-business-travel-ease/story-c2t1TDWFjZXkSiHEOADqNP.html
14-06-2020||World||Republican congressman who officiated gay wedding loses primary||A freshman Virginia GOP congressman who angered social conservatives in his district when he officiated a gay wedding lost his party’s nomination.US Rep. Denver Riggleman lost a GOP convention Saturday that was done via drive-thru because of the coronavirus pandemic. He was defeated by Bob Good, a former official in the athletics department at Liberty University.While the convention ended at 7 p.m., the vote tally was not announced until after 1 a.m. Sunday. Good said he won 58% of the vote, news outlets reported, and 5th District Republican Committee Chair Melvin Adams said 2,537 of the more than 3,500 registered delegates voted.Riggleman, a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, upset many Republicans in his district last summer when he officiated the wedding of two male campaign aides.The convention was held at a Lynchburg-area church near Good’s home and was the only place delegates could cast a ballot in a district that stretches from northern Virginia to the North Carolina border.Riggleman has said a small coterie of Republican insiders were trying to rig the contest against him forcing the nomination process to be decided with a convention instead of a primary. Conventions favor more conservative candidates and have been used for years by Virginia Republicans to block moderate Republicans from winning office.“Voting irregularities and ballot stuffing has been reported in multiple counties in the #VA05. Voter fraud has been a hallmark of this nomination process and I will not stand for it,” Riggleman tweeted a little over an hour before results were announced. “@VA_GOP needs to reevaluate their priorities. We are evaluating all our options at this time.”President Donald Trump endorsed Riggleman, as did Liberty University President Jerry Falwell Jr.Good is now the Republican nominee for Virginia’s 5th Congressional District. Four Democrats are vying to challenge him in the fall, with the winner picked later this summer.“That’s what losers say,” Good told reporters, commenting on Riggleman’s allegations of irregularities.Good has pledged to restore “Judeo-Christian” values to Congress. He’s also a hardliner on immigration and wants English to be the official language of the US. His victory could make national Democrats and outside groups more likely to spend money in the district, which easily went for Trump in 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republican-congressman-who-officiated-gay-wedding-loses-primary/story-LuFa0BsFHgg2AtZasPgdIN.html

In an undated clip, the cleric is seen telling the people to sleep more if they want to avoid getting the coronavirus disease.“Our doctors always recommend us to sleep more. The more we sleep, the more the virus sleeps. It won’t harm us. When we sleep it sleeps, when we die, it dies,” the cleric is heard saying in the video clip. When we sleep, virus sleeps.

14-06-2020||World||Australia’s largest states further ease coronavirus curbs||Australia’s two largest states will further ease public coronavirus restrictions at libraries, community centres and nightclubs, officials said on Sunday, despite recording increases in new infections.New South Wales (NSW), the most populous state, said that from July 1, a 50 person limit on indoor venues such as restaurants and churches would be scrapped, so long as the venues observed a one person per four square metre rule.Nightclubs and music festivals would also be allowed to operate from August if new cases remain low, NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian said. The state on Saturday reported the first locally transmitted Covid-19 case in weeks, and state officials on Sunday said there had been nine new infections since late Friday.In neighboring Victoria, where pubs and other venues are currently limited to 20 people, indoor businesses will be allowed to have up to 50 seated patrons from June 22, said state premier Daniel Andrews.All sports for children would resume, he said. Indoor sports centres and physical recreation spaces like gyms will be allowed to host 20 people, with caps of up to 10 adults per group, he added.Strict lockdown restrictions and the closure of state and national borders have allowed Australia to curb the spread of the coronavirus, with many parts of the country claiming to have eliminated the disease.With only 102 deaths, much lower than most other developed nations, the federal government has stepped up pressure on state and territory leaders to reopen internal borders, a step viewed as key to reviving the country’s economy.“We would love to open everything tomorrow. We can’t do that. Because if we did we would be almost making it certain that we would have a second wave,” Andrews told reporters in Melbourne.“They are happening in many countries around the world and it’s just not my practice to follow models that are proven by others not to work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-s-largest-states-further-ease-coronavirus-curbs/story-lA0CSNRvy3ZW4tRVD5LHiL.html
14-06-2020||World||India, with 12 nations, leads initiative at UN to counter misinformation on Covid-19||India, along with 12 other countries, has led an initiative here aimed at spreading fact-based content to counter misinformation on the coronavirus, with over 130 nations endorsing the global call to fight the “infodemic” relating to the Covid-19 pandemic. On the initiative by Australia, Chile, France, Georgia, India, Indonesia, Latvia, Lebanon, Mauritius, Mexico, Norway, Senegal and South Africa, a total of 132 member states endorsed a cross-regional statement on “infodemic” or manipulated information. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said that apart from fighting the deadly Covid-19 pandemic, the world is also seeing a “dangerous outbreak” of misinformation about harmful health advice, hate speech and wild conspiracy theories and antidote to this pandemic of misinformation is fact-based news and analysis. India’s Permanent Mission to the UN said that it supported the UN Communications Response initiative ‘#VERIFIED’ and “calls for global action to fight infodemic in times of Covid-19.” Last month, the United Nations launched ‘Verified’, an initiative to combat the growing scourge of Covid-19 misinformation by increasing the volume and reach of trusted, accurate information. The 13 nations co-authored the cross-regional statement, which said that in times of the Covid-19 health crisis, “the spread of the ‘infodemic’ can be as dangerous to human health and security as the pandemic itself. Among other negative consequences, Covid-19 has created conditions that enable the spread of disinformation, fake news and doctored videos to foment violence and divide communities.” “It is critical that states counter misinformation as a toxic driver of secondary impacts of the pandemic that can heighten the risk of conflict, violence, human rights violations and mass atrocities,” the cross-regional statement said. The 13 nations called on everybody to immediately cease spreading misinformation and to observe UN recommendations to tackle this issue. “The Covid-19 crisis has demonstrated the crucial need for access to free, reliable, trustworthy, factual, multilingual, targeted, accurate, clear and science-based information, as well as for ensuring dialogue and participation of all stakeholders and affected communities during the preparedness, readiness and response,” they said. The nations said that they along with other many countries and international institutions, such as the WHO and UNESCO, have worked towards increasing societal resilience against disinformation, which has improved overall preparedness to deal with and better comprehend both the “infodemic” and the Covid-19 pandemic. “We are also concerned about the damage caused by the deliberate creation and circulation of false or manipulated information relating to the pandemic,” the statement said. “We call on countries to take steps to counter the spread of such disinformation, in an objective manner and with due respect for citizens’ freedom of expression, as well as public order and safety. We reaffirm the importance of ensuring that people are accurately informed from trustworthy sources and are not misled by disinformation about Covid-19,” it said. The statement called for action by all Member States and stakeholders to fight the “infodemic” to build what the Secretary General has described a “healthier, more equitable, just and resilient world”. “We cannot cede our virtual spaces to those who traffic in lies, fear and hate,” Guterres had said announcing the initiative. “Misinformation spreads online, in messaging apps and person to person. Its creators use savvy production and distribution methods. To counter it, scientists and institutions like the United Nations need to reach people with accurate information they can trust,” he said. ‘Verified’, led by the UN Department for Global Communications (DGC), will provide information around three themes: science – to save lives; solidarity – to promote local and global cooperation; and solutions – to advocate for support to impacted populations. It will also promote recovery packages that tackle the climate crisis and address the root causes of poverty, inequality and hunger. The initiative is calling on people around the world to sign up to become “information volunteers” to share trusted content to keep their families and communities safe and connected. Described as digital first responders, the volunteers will receive a daily feed of verified content optimised for social sharing with simple, compelling messaging that either directly counters misinformation or fills an information void. “In many countries the misinformation surging across digital channels is impeding the public health response and stirring unrest. There are disturbing efforts to exploit the crisis to advance nativism or to target minority groups, which could worsen as the strain on societies grows and the economic and social fallout kicks in,” UN Under-Secretary-General for Global Communications Melissa Fleming said. “The Verified initiative will also work to address this trend with hopeful content that celebrates local acts of humanity, the contributions of refugees and migrants, and makes the case for global cooperation,” Fleming said. The initiative is a collaboration with Purpose, one of the world’s leading social mobilisation organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-with-12-nations-leads-initiative-at-un-to-counter-misinformation-on-covid-19/story-hhlIgvkfRAbmsCQkQgqyvK.html

In a statement announcing the initiative, he said, “As a first step, the BlackNorth Initiative will ask corporate leaders across Canada to pledge their organizations to policies and specific targets to end systemic anti-Black systemic racism. For companies who consider themselves diverse, hold that statement up against your board and your executive team – how many Blacks do you see?”Joining him are co-chairs Prem Watsa, chairman of Fairfax Financial Holdings Limited; Victor Dodig, president of the bank CIBC; and Rola Dagher, president and CEO of Cisco Systems Canada.In supporting the initiative that comes as a new conversation has started worldwide over racism after the killing by police of African-American George Floyd in Minneapolis last month, Watsa said, “The time for passing the buck is over. As business leaders in Canada, we have a responsibility to not only recognize that anti-Black systemic racism exists in this country but also take meaningful steps to end it.” Watsa, sometimes described as the Warren Buffet of Canada, is also the founder of the Invest India Conference.The Council has invited leaders of top 250 companies listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, over 100 of the biggest private businesses in Canada, major banks, insurance companies, international companies that have a significant presence in Canada, and the largest asset managers and institutional investors in the nation, to join the inaugural summit scheduled for July 20.Participants will be asked to sign a CEO Pledge, and outline what their plan will be to remove anti-black bias in their businesses. In its statement, the Council said, “Corporate Canada was bold enough to take up the challenge to add gender diversity to Canadian boardrooms and executive suites by declaring policies, setting specific targets, and holding itself accountable and is now well on the way to reforming the system. Now it is time to do the same thing for Blacks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-business-leaders-come-together-to-challenge-systemic-racism/story-EO3Hurykt0K2mrwfiigGIP.html

The incident was caught on camera.Images on local television showed the restaurant in flames, with no fire crews on the scene. Other demonstrators marched onto Interstate-75, where they were met by police.Brooks was the father of a young daughter who was celebrating her birthday on Saturday, his lawyers said. His death from a police bullet came after more than two weeks of demonstrations in major cities across the United States in the name of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who died on May 25 under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.Police were called to the Wendy’s over reports that Brooks had fallen asleep in the drive-thru line. Officers attempted to take him into custody after he failed a field sobriety test, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation.Video shot by a bystander captures Brooks struggling with two officers on the ground outside the Wendy’s before breaking free and running across the parking lot with what appears to be a police TASER in his hand.Anti-racism protesters on Saturday sought to call attention to the death of another black man - who was found hanging from a tree in California.Hundreds of people marched in Palmdale to demand an investigation into the death of Robert Fuller, 24. They marched from where the body was found to a sheriff’s station, with many carrying signs that said “Justice for Robert Fuller”.Authorities said the death appeared to be a suicide, but an autopsy was planned. The city said there were no outdoor cameras that could have recorded what happened.The Atlanta police chief, meanwhile, resigned on Saturday over the incident outside Wendy’s. By Saturday evening, Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced that she had accepted the resignation of Police Chief Erika Shields.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rayshard-brooks-shooting-protesters-set-wendy-s-restaurant-on-fire/story-7mr5sSxQNibqT4tESQgVEO.html

14-06-2020||World||China reports 57 new Covid-19 cases, highest daily number in 2 months||China on Sunday reported its highest daily total of new coronavirus cases in two months after the capital’s biggest wholesale food market was shut down following a resurgence in local infections.There were 57 confirmed cases in the 24 hours through midnight Saturday, the National Health Commission reported. That was the highest daily toll since mid-April and included 36 in Beijing, the capital.The new cases illustrated how the virus can come back as anti-disease controls are relaxed.The Xinfadi market on Beijing’s southeastern side was closed Saturday and neighboring residential compounds locked down after more then 50 people in the capital tested positive for the coronavirus. They were the first confirmed cases in 50 days in the city of 20 million people.China, where the pandemic began in December, had relaxed most of its anti-virus controls after the ruling Communist Party declared victory over the disease in March.Authorities locked down 11 residential communities near the Xinfadi market. Police installed white fencing to seal off a road leading to a cluster of apartment buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-57-new-covid-19-cases-highest-daily-number-in-2-months/story-sunQ4ddDNoW6GPGjEiPuVM.html

During protests, far-right demonstrators also emerged in large groups for the first time -- particularly in London -- leading to sometimes violent confrontations that included attacks on police officers.UK Home Secretary Priti Patel urged citizens not to protest Saturday because of the ongoing coronavirus threat.“Well, I think it’s just stating the facts. We are in a health emergency right now. I think the fact that we have made this clear in terms of ‘people should not gather’, ‘they should not protest’, the police are saying this every single day as well, really speaks to a very real public health message that we are restating to the British public,” she said.Black Lives Matter protestors emerged worldwide following the death of African American man George Floyd in police custody in the US.The worldwide spread of anti-racist protests following the death of George Floyd has led to calls to defund police departments and take down Confederate statues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-protests-over-100-arrested-in-london/story-0MaHkgYdL8TmuXUXdv2N2N.html
14-06-2020||World||Hong Kong’s rich are preparing for a worst-case scenario||One Hong Kong businessman moved $10 million to Singapore and plans to transfer more. Another is eyeing London property, worried that prices in Hong Kong are too high. Well-to-do families across the city are opening offshore bank accounts and applying for alternative passports.While it doesn’t add up to an exodus just yet, Hong Kong’s rich are increasingly hedging their bets as the financial hub suffers its worst economic and political crises since at least 1997.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMany high-net-worth investors are either reducing their Hong Kong exposure or taking steps to ensure they can withdraw assets at a moment’s notice, underscoring the challenge for Chief Executive Carrie Lam as she tries to maintain the city’s status as magnet for Asian wealth. Rich individuals are major players in Hong Kong’s equity and real-estate markets as well as big buyers of Chinese corporate bonds issued in the city.Private bankers say their clients accelerated contingency planning efforts after China announced last month it would impose controversial national security laws on Hong Kong. The legislation threatens to erode the former British colony’s judicial independence, provoke sanctions from the US and revive street protests that battered the tourism and retail industries even before the coronavirus outbreak plunged the economy into its deepest recession on record.“What we’re basically seeing is a bit like a slow-moving train wreck,” said Richard Harris, chief executive of Port Shelter Investment Management in Hong Kong. “People who haven’t moved their money out may be tempted to think: ‘Well, maybe I should be moving my money out.’ That process is likely to continue.”To be sure, there’s little evidence so far of widespread capital flight.Hong Kong bank deposits increased to a record in April and the city’s currency has continued to trade at the strong end of its permitted band against the dollar. Hong Kong’s wealthiest billionaires have publicly endorsed the proposed security laws and expressed confidence in the city’s future.In private, however, many Hong Kong entrepreneurs and high-earning professionals are sounding a more pessimistic note.Cheng, the businessman who moved $10 million to Singapore, also secured his permanent resident status in the city-state this year and has been selling his Hong Kong properties. He has no concrete plans to emigrate yet, but is considering his options. He and his family have passports from the US, Canada, Australia and France.Cheng, who was born in Hong Kong, said he worries about China’s tightening grip on the city and the prospect for more unrest. Like several of the people quoted in this story, he asked not to reveal his full name because of the political sensitivity of the subject.Sam, a senior investment banker in Hong Kong, has decided to leave the city. The 43-year-old is emigrating to Australia with his wife and two young boys in about three months, the second time he will have left Hong Kong during a period of political turmoil. Sam grew up in the city, but moved to Brisbane when he was 12 after his parents got spooked by China’s crackdown on protesters in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square in 1989. He came back to Hong Kong 20 years ago for his career but now sees no upside to staying.“Things are looking bad and deteriorating,” he said. “We may as well pack our bags and move to Australia so that the kids can have a better environment growing up.”Margaret Chau, a Hong Kong-based immigration program director for Goldmax Immigration Consulting Co., said inquiries at her firm have jumped about five-fold after news of the national security legislation. For now, most of her wealthy customers are more interested setting up an escape route than leaving right away.“They see this as a backup plan,” Chau said.Kerry Goh, chief executive officer of multi-family office Kamet Capital in Singapore, said his clients have shifted from asking generic questions about moving out of Hong Kong to making detailed inquiries about everything from schools to visas and bank accounts.“What’s happened in Hong Kong has really sped up the timing of 2047,” Goh said, referring to the expiration date of China’s 50-year pledge to preserve Hong Kong’s autonomy after the handover from Britain. “As Hong Kong’s troubles shoot up, the benefits of Singapore have become more self-explanatory.”Other more far-flung locales are also attracting increased interest from investors in Hong Kong. Puerto Rico’s Standard International Bank, a so-called International Financial Entity that expanded its footprint in Asia last year, has seen its deposits more than triple since December 2019, according to general manager Maria Diaz. “Turbulence in Hong Kong has changed the landscape,” she said.Dennis, a 34-year-old executive at a Hong Kong-based consulting firm founded by his parents, said his family and many of their friends have started moving cash out of the city. He’s looking to buy more properties in the U.K., where he spent almost a decade attending boarding school and university.“I could buy a much bigger flat in London, so why not?” he said. “I’m just trying to protect my money against any uncertainty.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-rich-are-preparing-for-a-worst-case-scenario/story-Fa7pvOwIKtfE6gdzhEQ99L.html

They overran government forces, taking some casualties but killing at least 20 soldiers and roaming the area for three hours.The sources said hundreds of civilians were injured in the crossfire, overwhelming the local hospital and forcing some of the injured to lay outside the facility awaiting help.The sources said the terrorists also set fire to the local police station and burned down the United Nations’ humanitarian hub in the area, although a UN spokesperson said the facility sustained only light damage. Fighters distributed letters to residents, in the local Hausa language, warning them not to work with the military, white Christian westerners or other “non-believers”.terrorists also entered Nganzai at about the same time on Saturday, according to two residents and one Civilian Joint Task Force (CJTF) fighter. They arrived on motorcycles and in pickup trucks and killed more than 40 residents, the sources said.A military spokesman did not answer calls for comment on the attacks. U.N. officials could not immediately be reached for comment.Boko Haram and its offshoot, Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP), have killed thousands and displaced millions in northeastern Nigeria. ISWAP claimed the two Saturday attacks, and the Gubio attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terrorists-kill-20-soldiers-40-civilians-in-northeast-nigeria-attacks/story-NqJZJUaAZZLQpZHlEitCQJ.html
14-06-2020||World||Bars reopening in New Orleans. Will tourists come?||Bar owners in New Orleans prepared for a soft opening, and an uncertain one, as they began letting customers in Saturday for the first time in months. Capacity is limited to 25 percent, live music remains prohibited, and nobody knows how many tourists will show on Bourbon Street in the age of Covid-19.Pam Fortner, owner of six French Quarter venues, is opening only two of them, both on Bourbon, where the customary blocks-long frat party atmosphere ended in an abrupt shutdown in mid-March.Now, she’s not sure what to expect. She sat at a sidewalk table at Royal and St. Ann on Thursday, eating a Caesar salad and deriving hope from the occasional out-of-state license plate she saw amid sparse traffic.“I think Saturday will be busy,” she said in an interview.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageCherie Boos, manager of Lafitte’s Blacksmith Shop, in an authentically rustic, creaky floored 18th-century Creole cottage, said she’s hoping locals will help keep the bar financially afloat as Bourbon Street revives. But she adds, “We’re hoping that, you know, we can start generating some tourists in the city, too, now that the bars are going to be open.”Bourbon Street, which had the ambiance of an empty movie set in April, has experienced a slow re-awakening in recent weeks. Dine-in restaurants have been allowed to reopen at 25% capacity, as have bars with food permits. Still, traffic has been slow and plywood covered numerous tavern windows until Mayor LaToya Cantrell announced the latest easing of restrictions in a city that, in the spring, had become an international hot spot for Covid-19.Even as they announced the reopenings on Tuesday, city officials admitted they were concerned about a possible recurrence.“Oh, I’m worried. I am worried,” Cantrell said at a news conference. She said city code enforcement officials will watch to make sure social distancing, masking requirements and building capacity limits are enforced.Customers will have to be mindful, too, said Dr. Jennifer Avegno, the city’s health director. “If you’re there, with your household group and you’re having drinks at a table at a bar, we really need you not to go off and mingle with the other tables,” she said Tuesday.Toward that end, there will be no musicians on stage at Fortner’s Tropical Isle bars on Bourbon Street. That prevents people from congregating near the stage and eliminates the possibility that a singer belting out a song could also be unknowingly spreading the virus. That fear that has kept the city from allowing live music performances, including choirs in churches.Some New Orleans bar owners are critical of the restrictions. “Why are they picking on the musicians?” said Fortner.And some bars, like the Maple Leaf, a venerable late night haunt in the Carrollton neighborhood, decided not to open.‘While our City leaders have decided to allow bars to reopen ... we will not be allowed to have Live Music and what is the Leaf without our musicians?” read a post on the Maple Leaf’s Facebook page.One of the quarter’s best known tourist spots, Pat O’Brien’s, also didn’t plan an immediate reopening. Manager Shelley Waguespack has numerous concerns as she decides when and how to reopen.She’s hoping the state Legislature will address one concern — liability. She said she worries about getting sued if someone who visits the bar later comes down with Covid-19.She’s also unhappy about the limits on live music.“We wanted to put a piano player on the patio,” Waguespack said. “We thought that would have been lovely.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bars-reopening-in-new-orleans-will-tourists-come/story-z1X8oxxs8edLSg2tA4njbJ.html
14-06-2020||World||Atlanta police chief resigns after fatal police shooting of Rayshard Brooks||Atlanta’s police chief resigned Saturday hours after a black man was fatally shot by officers in a struggle following a field sobriety test. Authorities said the slain man had grabbed an officer’s Taser, but was running away when he was shot.Police Chief Erika Shields stepped down as the killing of 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks sparked a new wave of protests in Atlanta after turbulent demonstrations that followed the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis had simmered down.Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms announced the police chief’s resignation at a Saturday news conference as roughly 150 people marched outside the Wendy’s restaurant where Brooks was fatally shot late Friday. The mayor also called for the immediate firing of the unidentified officer who opened fire at Brooks.“I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force and have called for the immediate termination of the officer,” Bottoms said.She said it was Shields’ own decision to step aside as police chief and that she would remain with the city in an undetermined role. Interim Corrections Chief Rodney Bryant would serve as interim police chief until a permanent replacement is found.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which is investigating the shooting, said the deadly confrontation started with officers responding to a complaint that a man was sleeping in a car blocking the restaurant’s drive-thru lane. The GBI said Brooks failed a field sobriety test and then resisted officers’ attempts to arrest him.The GBI released security camera video of the shooting Saturday. The footage shows a man running from two police officers as he raises a hand, which is holding some type of object, toward an officer a few steps behind him. The officer draws his gun and fires as the man keeps running, then falls to the ground in the parking lot.GBI Director Vic Reynolds said Brooks had grabbed a Taser from one of the officers and appeared to point it at the officer as he fled, prompting the officer to reach for his gun.“In a circumstance like this where an officer is involved in the use of deadly force, the public has a right to know what happened,” GBI Director Vic Reynolds told a news conference on a day when protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting and in other areas of Atlanta.The security camera video does not show Brooks’ initial struggle with police.The shooting came at a time of heightened tension over police brutality and calls for reforms across the US following the May 25 death of Floyd in Minneapolis. Atlanta was among US cities where large crowds of protesters took to the streets.Demonstrators including members of Brooks’ family gathered Saturday outside the restaurant where he was shot. Police shut down streets for several blocks around the restaurant as protesters marched peacefully in the streets. There was a short, tense standoff with Georgia state troopers who lined up to block protesters as they tried to march onto a nearby interstate highway. The demonstrators eventually turned away.Among those protesting was Crystal Brooks, who said she is Rayshard Brooks’ sister-in-law.“He wasn’t causing anyone any harm,” she said. “The police went up to the car and even though the car was parked they pulled him out of the car and started tussling with him.”She added: “He did grab the Taser, but he just grabbed the Taser and ran.”Shields, Atlanta’s police chief for less than four years, was initially praised in the days following Floyd’s death last month. She said the Minnesota officers involved should go to prison and walked into crowds of protesters in downtown Atlanta, telling demonstrators she understood their frustrations and fears. She appeared at Bottoms’ side as the mayor made an impassioned plea for protesters to go home when things turned violent with smashed storefronts and police cruisers set ablaze.Days later, Shields fired two officers and benched three others caught on video May 30 in a hostile confrontation with two college students whose car was stuck in traffic caused by the protests. The officers shouted at the pair, fired Tasers at them and dragged them from the vehicle. When prosecutors charged six officers with crimes in the incident, however, Shields openly questioned the timing and appropriateness of the charges.The shooting of Brooks two weeks later raised further questions about the Atlanta department. In a statement, Shields said she chose to resign “out of a deep and abiding love for this city and this department.”“It is time for the city to move forward and build trust between law enforcement and the communities they serve,” Shields said.Reynolds said his agents worked through the night interviewing witnesses and reviewing video. He said their findings show that Brooks tried to fight off two officers when they tried to arrest him and at one point managed to take a Taser away from one of them.A security camera recorded Brooks “running or fleeing from Atlanta police officers,” Reynolds said. “It appears that he has in his hand a Taser.”During a short foot chase Brooks “turns around and it appears at that time he points a Taser at an Atlanta officer,” Reynolds said. That’s when the officer drew his gun and shot Brooks, he said, estimating the officer fired three times.Reynolds said his agents will turn over results of their investigation to Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard, whose office will decide whether criminal charges are warranted against either of the officers.Howard said Saturday his office “has already launched an intense, independent investigation of the incident” without waiting for the GBI’s results.The officers involved in the shooting were not identified.Brooks died after being taken to an Atlanta hospital. One of the officers was treated and released for unspecified injuries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/atlanta-police-chief-resigns-after-fatal-police-shooting/story-rMO7K6XbKdjIQTMxZUiDvI.html
14-06-2020||World||Trump calls out ‘evil of slavery’ at West Point graduation ceremony speech||As the nation continues to grapple with its racial past, President Donald Trump urged West Point’s graduating class Saturday to “never forget” the legacy of soldiers before them who fought a bloody war to “extinguish the evil of slavery.”Trump’s appeal to remember history came as his own relationship with the military is under strain from the unrelenting criticism he and Pentagon leaders have faced over their response to protests that erupted after George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis.It also came hours after Trump made what amounted to a rare concession for him: He rescheduled a campaign rally planned for Tulsa, Oklahoma, on June 19. The day marks the end of slavery in the US, and Tulsa was the scene of a fiery white-on-black attack in 1921.“What has historically made America unique is the durability of its institutions against the passions and prejudices of the moment,” Trump told more than 1,100 graduates at an unusual outdoor ceremony held during a pandemic. “When times are turbulent, when the road is rough, what matters most is that which is permanent, timeless, enduring and eternal.”In the past two weeks, Trump has yelled at Defense Secretary Mark Esper for publicly opposing his call to deploy active-duty troops to quell the protests stemming from the killing of Floyd, who was black, by a white Minneapolis police officer.Trump also shut down Esper’s attempt to begin a public debate on removing the names of Confederate Army officers — some of whom trained at West Point — from military bases, an idea gaining momentum across the country.Gen. Mark Milley, the Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman, risked Trump’s ire Thursday by declaring he had made “a mistake” by accompanying Trump on a June 1 walk through Lafayette Square. It ended with the president posing with a Bible outside a boarded-up St. John’s Church.Milley’s comments amounted to an extraordinary expression of regret by Trump’s chief military adviser, who said his appearance led to the perception of the military becoming embroiled in politics, which in his view — one shared by Esper — is a threat to democracy.The events have stirred debate within the military and among retired officers. More than 500 West Point graduates from classes spanning six decades signed an open letter reminding the Class of 2020 of its commitment to avoid partisan politics.The letter, published this week on Medium, also alluded to the problems Esper and Milley encountered at the White House after Floyd’s death.“Sadly, the government has threatened to use the Army in which you serve as a weapon against fellow Americans engaging in these legitimate protests,” they wrote. “Worse, military leaders, who took the same oath you take today, have participated in politically charged events. The principle of civilian control is central to the military profession. But that principle does not imply blind obedience.”During the commencement ceremony, protesters denounced the president from boats and kayaks along the nearby Hudson River.Trump also used his first West Point address to remind the newly commissioned officers of the academy’s history and storied generals like Douglas MacArthur and Dwight D. Eisenhower.“It was on this soil that American patriots held the most vital fortress in our war for independence,” Trump said. He said the US Military Academy “gave us the men and women who fought and won a bloody war to extinguish the evil of slavery within one lifetime of our founding.’’“This is your history. This is the legacy that each of you inherits,” Trump continued, adding that it was bought with American blood spilled in battle. “You must never forget it.”Trump, however, was incorrect to say women had been trained at West Point for the anti-slavery fight; they were not allowed to become cadets until 1976.His remarks also overlooked numerous West Point graduates who served in the Confederacy, including President Jefferson Davis, Gen. Robert E. Lee and Gen. Braxton Bragg. Some are now seeking the removal of Bragg’s name from North Carolina’s Fort Bragg.In the speech, Trump leaned into his “America first” brand of foreign policy without uttering the phrase, telling the Army’s newest officers their job is “not to rebuild foreign nations, but to defend and defend strongly our nation from our foreign enemies.”“It is not the duty of US troops to solve ancient conflicts in faraway lands that many people have never heard of.” He said America is not the “policeman of the world,” but warned adversaries that it will “never, ever hesitate” to act when its people are threatened.He thanked those in the military who helped the country respond to the coronavirus, once again calling it an “invisible enemy” from China.The president stressed the unity of a graduating class that came “from every race, religion, color and creed.” The class also includes citizens of 11 other countries, including Bosnia-Herzegovina, South Korea and Tanzania.Trump highlighted bigger defense budgets under his watch but falsely said he had destroyed 100% of the Islamic State caliphate in the Middle East; the group still poses a threat to the US He noted he had directed the killing of two terrorist leaders and had created the Space Force.Trump also remembered a cadet who died in an accident last year and whose father is a Secret Service agent, and noted that both he and the Army share a birthday Sunday. Trump will turn 74, while the Army marks its 254th year of existence.Esper did not attend, but emphasized the principles of duty, honor and country in a video message, saying they will help guide the new officers “in challenging times and in the face of new and emerging threats.”Trump’s appearance at West Point had been criticized as a political move that would put the graduates at risk since the academy is located up the Hudson River from New York City, the epicenter of the US coronavirus outbreak.The Army defended the move, saying the cadets had to return to campus anyway for final medical checks, equipment and training. They had been home since spring break in early March..For the ceremony, the newly commissioned second lieutenants wore face masks as they marched onto the parade field, but removed them after sitting for the socially distant ceremony required by the pandemic.Instead of shaking hands with the president, they exchanged salutes. Family and friends were not allowed to attend and had to watch online.At the end of the ceremony, five hulking helicopters flew low and slow over the field as the graduates tossed their white dress caps into the air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-calls-out-evil-of-slavery-at-west-point-graduation-ceremony-speech/story-p3OKzQMvuhjOaetbLLg4fJ.html
14-06-2020||World||Atlanta police shoot, kill black man who grabbed a Taser||A black man killed by Atlanta police in a struggle following a field sobriety test was shot after he snatched an officer’s Taser and pointed it back at the officer while fleeing, the head of the Georgia agency investigating the case said Saturday.Georgia Bureau of Investigation Director Vic Reynolds said the Friday night shooting outside a Wendy’s restaurant was captured by a security camera as well as by witnesses’ cellphones. Reynolds said the GBI would share the security camera footage with the public later Saturday.“In a circumstance like this where an officer is involved in the use of deadly force, the public has a right to know what happened,” Reynolds told a news conference on a day when protesters gathered at the scene of the shooting and in other areas of Atlanta.Atlanta police were called to the restaurant on a complaint that a man was sleeping in a car blocking the drive-thru lane as customers waited in line, the GBI said. The agency identified the man who was fatally shot as 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks.The shooting came at a time of heightened tension over police brutality and calls for reforms across the US following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Atlanta was among US cities where large crowds of protesters took to the streets.A crowd of demonstrators gathered Saturday outside the Atlanta restaurant where Brooks was shot. Gerald Griggs, an attorney and a vice president of Atlanta’s NAACP chapter, estimated there were 150 people protesting at the scene as he walked with them Saturday afternoon.“The people are upset,” Griggs said. “They want to know why their dear brother Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed when he was merely asleep on the passenger side and not doing anything.” Even though Brooks struggled with officers, Griggs said, “they could have used nonlethal force to take him down.” Reynolds said his agents worked through the night interviewing witnesses and reviewing video. He said their findings show that Brooks tried to fight off two officers when they tried to arrest him and at one point managed to take a Taser away from one of them.A security camera recorded Brooks “running or fleeing from Atlanta police officers,” Reynolds said. “It appears that he has in his hand a Taser.” During a short foot chase Brooks “turns around and it appears at that time he points a Taser at an Atlanta officer,” Reynolds said. That’s when the officer drew his gun and shot Brooks, he said, estimating the officer fired three times.Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Timothy Peek told reporters late Friday that both officers deployed their Tasers in an attempt to subdue the suspect but were unable to “stop the aggression of the fight.” Reynolds said his agents will turn over results of their investigation to Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard, whose office will decide whether criminal charges are warranted against either of the officers.Howard said Saturday his office had already gotten involved.“My office has already launched an intense, independent investigation of the incident,” Howard said in a statement, saying members of his staff “were on scene shortly after the shooting, and we have been in investigative sessions ever since to identify all of the facts and circumstances surrounding this incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/atlanta-police-shoot-kill-black-man-who-grabbed-a-taser/story-9RAtOMVBOfXi2DUgBcS9RJ.html
14-06-2020||World||Global recoveries from Covid-19 cross 4 million||Worldwide, more than 4 million people - or 51% of those infected with Covid-19 - have recovered from the deadly infection that emerged at a market in central China late last year and has shown little sign of abating, affecting more than 7.7 million people globally. With this, the number of recoveries far exceeds the number of active coronavirus cases, offering a glimmer of hope even as the Covid-19 pandemic appears to be accelerating in its third major surge of infections. The total number of fatalities recorded from the disease world over stood at nearly 430,000. The US is the worst-hit country with 2.1 million infections and almost 120,000 deaths.  In Brazil, which is the second worst-affected nation after the US, with over 831,000 cases and nearly 42,000 deaths, the city of Sao Paulo has an unorthodox plan to free up space at its graveyards as the crisis there deepens: digging up the bones of people buried in the past and storing their bagged remains in large metal containers.Sao Paulo’s municipal funeral service said on Friday that the remains of people who died at least three years ago will be exhumed and put in numbered bags, then stored temporarily in 12 storage containers it has purchased. Sao Paulo is one of the Covid-19 hotspots in Latin America’s hardest-hit nation, with 5,480 deaths as of Thursday in the city of 12 million people. Health experts are worried about a new surge now that a decline in intensive care bed occupancy to about 70% prompted mayor Bruno Covas to authorise a partial reopening of business this week.Health experts say the peak of Brazil’s pandemic will arrive in August, having spread from the big cities where it first appeared in the nation’s interiors.Michael Ryan, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) emergencies chief, said on Friday that the situation in Brazil remains “of concern”, although acknowledged that intensive care bed occupancy rates are now below 80% in most areas of the country.At Sao Paulo’s biggest cemetery, Vila Formosa, Adenilson Costa was among workers in blue protective suits digging up old graves on Friday. He said their work has only grown more arduous during the pandemic, and as he removed bones from unearthed coffins, he said he fears what is to come.“With this opening of malls and stores, we get even more worried. We are not in the curve; we are in the peak and people aren’t aware,” Costa said. “This isn’t over. Now is the worrisome moment.” In April, gravediggers at Vila Formosa buried 1,654 people, up more than 500 from the previous month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-recoveries-from-covid-19-cross-4-million/story-LEu7nctYtY9sLImSOldfgP.html
14-06-2020||World||Atlanta police shoot, kill suspect after struggle||A man reported to police for sleeping in a car blocking the drive-thru lane of a fast food restaurant was shot and killed in a late night struggle with Atlanta officers after he failed a field sobriety test and resisted arrest, Georgia authorities said Saturday.The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said it was asked by the Atlanta Police Department to investigate the shooting of 27-year-old Rayshard Brooks, which happened at a Wendy’s restaurant late Friday.The shooting came at a time of heightened tension over police brutality and calls for reforms across the U.S. following the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Atlanta was among U.S. cities where large crowds of protesters took to the streets.A crowd of demonstrators gathered Saturday outside the Atlanta restaurant where Brooks was shot. Gerald Griggs, an attorney and a vice president of Atlanta’s NAACP chapter, estimated there were 150 people protesting at the scene as he walked with them Saturday afternoon.“The people are upset,” Griggs said. “They want to know why their dear brother Rayshard Brooks was shot and killed when he was merely asleep on the passenger side and not doing anything.”Even though Brooks struggled with officers, Griggs said, “they could have used nonlethal force to take him down.”The GBI said its agents were reviewing video taken by witnesses. The agency also posted to Twitter a plea for witnesses to come forward, saying some at the scene “chose not to be interviewed by GBI agents.”Officers were responding to a complaint of a man in a vehicle parked in the drive-thru who was asleep, causing customers to drive around the vehicle.After Brooks failed a field sobriety test, the officers attempted to place him into custody, according to the GBI. But he resisted and a struggle ensued, leading the officer to deploy a Taser.“Ultimately, when the officer used a Taser, it was ineffective for the suspect,” Atlanta Deputy Police Chief Timothy Peek told reporters at the scene Friday night. “It did not stop the aggression of the fight. And so the suspect was able to take the officer’s Taser from him.”Peek said a second officer also attempted to use a Taser on the struggling man, “but it didn’t work against the suspect as well.”The GBI said in statement it was investigating reports “that the male subject was shot by an officer in the struggle over the Taser.”Brooks was transported to a local hospital where he died after surgery, the statement said.One officer was treated for an injury and discharged from the hospital.Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard said Saturday his office had already gotten involved without waiting for the GBI to finish its investigation.“My office has already launched an intense, independent investigation of the incident,” Howard said in a statement, saying members of his staff “were on scene shortly after the shooting, and we have been in investigative sessions ever since to identify all of the facts and circumstances surrounding this incident.”Stacey Abrams, the Georgia Democrat who gained national prominence running for governor in 2018, tweeted Saturday of the shooting that “sleeping in a drive-thru must not end in death.”“The killing of #RayshardBrooks in Atlanta last night demands we severely restrict the use of deadly force,” Abrams’ tweet said. “Yes, investigations must be called for — but so too should accountability.”The officers involved in the shooting was not identified. Once its investigation is complete, the case will be turned over to the Fulton County District Attorney’s Office for review.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/atlanta-police-shoot-kill-suspect-after-struggle/story-NabseL7p24G9DPr5Xj3WqM.html
14-06-2020||World||Seattle man beats coronavirus, then gets stunning $1.1 million hospital bill||Seattle resident Michael Flor, known as the longest-hospitalised Covid-19 patient, has now been dubbed a million-dollar baby after he received the enormous bill from the hospital for his battle with coronavirus recently, the Seattle Times reported on Friday.Not only did Flor survive the infection, he ran up a huge tab amounting to nearly $1.1 million-- Rs 8.1411 crore and was saddled with a bill that resembled a book since it ran into an astounding 181 pages. The 70-year-old, hospitalised for the longest time, nearly had a brush with death one night when he was suffering from the deadly pathogen. A night-shift nurse was sympathetic and held a phone to his ear while his wife and children bid him goodbye. But Flor survived. His recovery prompted those around him to call him the miracle child. But there was more in store for Flor as he found out when he got his hospital bill at his home in West Seattle. He says his heart almost failed a second time when he saw the amount that his healthcare sojourn had cost him.The total tab for his bout with the coronavirus was $1.1 million—an estimated Rs 8.1411 crore. The bill also ran into 181 pages.The bill is technically an explanation of charges, and because Flor has insurance he won’t have to pay the majority of it. In fact, because he had Covid-19, and not a different disease, he might not have to pay anything at all.For now though Flor is stunned and his family and friends have been left wondering at the extreme expense and completely bizarre economics of the American healthcare system.The elderly man was hospitalised at the Swedish Medical Center in Issaquah with Covid-19 for 62 days, so he knew the bill would be a lot. He was unconscious for much of his stay there, but once near the beginning of his illness, his wife Elisa Del Rosario remembers him waking up and saying, “You gotta get me out of here, we can’t afford this.”Just the charge for his room in the intensive care unit was billed at $9,736 per day. Due to the contagious nature of the virus, the room was sealed and could only be entered by medical workers wearing plastic suits and headgear. For 42 days he was in this isolation chamber, for a total cost of $408,912.He was also put on a mechanical ventilator for 29 days, with the use of the machine billed at $2,835 per day, for a total of $82,215. About a quarter of the bill is for the expenses incurred on drugs.This list of expenses tells the story of Flor’s battle and the battle waged against the infection for many like him. Not all of whom can afford it.For the two days when his heart, kidneys and lungs were all failing, indicating multiple organ failure—often the case in coronavirus-- and he was closest to death, the bill runs for 20 pages and totals nearly $100,000. The doctors, it seems “were throwing everything at me they could think of,” Flor says.In all, there are nearly 3,000 itemized charges, about 50 per day. Usually hospitals get paid only a portion of the amount they bill, as most have negotiated discounts with insurance companies. The charges don’t include the two weeks of recuperating he did in a rehab facility.Speaking about his feelings, Flor said he was surprised at his own reaction after being handed the hospital bill--which was guilt. The guilt of the survivor.“I feel guilty about surviving,” he says. “There’s a sense of ‘why me?’ Why did I deserve all this? Looking at the incredible cost of it all definitely adds to that survivor’s guilt.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seattle-man-beats-coronavirus-then-gets-stunning-1-1-million-hospital-bill/story-8Uwxs8Ejpg2owtqdekrqEL.html
14-06-2020||World||Kim Jong Un’s sister threatens South Korea with military action||The powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened military action against South Korea as she bashed Seoul on Saturday over declining bilateral relations and its inability to stop activists from floating anti-Pyongyang leaflets across the border.Describing South Korea as an “enemy,” Kim Yo Jong repeated an earlier threat she had made by saying Seoul will soon witness the collapse of a “useless” inter-Korean liaison office in the border town of Kaesong.Kim, who is first vice department director of the ruling Workers’ Party’s Central Committee, said she would leave it to North Korea’s military leaders to carry out the next step of retaliation against the South.“By exercising my power authorized by the supreme leader, our party and the state, I gave an instruction to the arms of the department in charge of the affairs with enemy to decisively carry out the next action,” she said in a statement carried by the North’s official Korean Central News Agency.“If I drop a hint of our next plan the (South Korean) authorities are anxious about, the right to taking the next action against the enemy will be entrusted to the General Staff of our army,” she said. “Our army, too, will determine something for cooling down our people’s resentment and surely carry out it, I believe.”Kim Yo Jong’s harsh rhetoric demonstrates her elevated status in North Korea’s leadership. Already seen as the most powerful woman in the country and her brother’s closest confidant, state media recently confirmed that she is now in charge of relations with South Korea.The liaison office in Kaesong, which has been shut since January due to coronavirus concerns, was set up as a result of one of the main agreements reached in three summits between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in 2018.Moon’s government had lobbied hard to set up nuclear summits between Kim and President Donald Trump, who have met three times since 2018. At the same time, Moon also worked to improve inter-Korean relations.But North Korea in recent months has suspended virtually all cooperation with the South while expressing frustration over the lack of progress in its nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration.The North declared over the past week that it would cut off all government and military communication channels with the South and threatened to abandon key inter-Korean peace agreements reached by their leaders in 2018.They include a military agreement in which the Koreas committed to jointly take steps to reduce conventional military threats, such as establishing border buffers and no-fly zones. They also removed some front-line guard posts and jointly surveyed a waterway near their western border in an unrealized plan to allow freer civilian navigation.In an earlier statement last week, Kim Yo Jong said that the North would scrap the military agreement, “which is hardly of any value,” while calling North Korean defectors who send leaflets from the South “human scum” and “mongrel dogs.”Her statement on Saturday came hours after a senior North Korean Foreign Ministry official said that Seoul should drop “nonsensical” talk about the North’s denuclearization, and that his country would continue to expand its military capabilities to counter what it perceives as threats from the United States.The comments by Kwon Jong Gun, director-general of the ministry’s U.S. affairs department, were in response to South Korea’s Foreign Ministry, which had told reporters that Seoul would continue to work toward improving bilateral relations and reviving nuclear negotiations between Pyongyang and Washington.In response to North Korea’s anger over the leaflets, South Korea’s government has said it would press charges against two defector groups that have been carrying out border protests. The South also said it would push new laws to ban activists from flying the leaflets across the border, but there’s been criticism over whether Moon’s government is sacrificing democratic principles to keep alive his ambitions for inter-Korean engagement.For years, activists have floated huge balloons into North Korea carrying leaflets criticizing Kim Jong Un over his nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record. The leafleting has sometimes triggered a furious response from North Korea, which bristles at any attempt to undermine its leadership.While Seoul has sometimes sent police officers to block the activists during sensitive times, it had previously resisted North Korea’s calls to fully ban them, saying they were exercising their freedom. Activists have vowed to continue with the balloon launches.“We should not lend an ear to and trust the trite language let out by (the South) for only form’s sake as they always make a fuss belatedly, nor pardon the sins committed by the betrayers and human scum,” Kim Yo Jong said.“Getting stronger day by day are the unanimous voices of all our people demanding for surely settling accounts with the riff-raff who dared hurt the absolute prestige of our supreme leader ... and flied rubbish to the inviolable territory of our side.”Nuclear talks faltered at Kim’s second summit with Trump in Vietnam in February last year after the United States rejected North Korea’s demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for a partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.Trump and Kim met for a third time that year in June at the border between North and South Korea and agreed to resume talks. But an October working-level meeting in Sweden broke down over what the North Koreans described as the Americans’ “old stance and attitude.”On the two-year anniversary of the first Kim-Trump meeting, North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Son Gwon said Friday that the North would never again gift Trump with high-profile meetings he could boast as foreign policy achievements unless it gets something substantial in return.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-s-sister-threatens-south-korea-with-military-action/story-Fr90NCT23YIY5lnvRFsyOK.html
14-06-2020||World||India had offered dialogue to Nepal on row over map. Why PM Oli ignored it||On Saturday, the lower house of the Nepali Parliament passed the constitutional amendment bill updating the so-called “political map of Nepal”. The “updated map” includes territories that are parts of the Indian states of Uttarakhand and Bihar. The bill will now go through Nepal’s upper house before receiving presidential assent. According to experts, that is a mere formality.In Nepal, a question that continues to be raised among the intelligentsia, public, politicians is why India has been silent on diplomatic dialogue.But first, lets focus on the ongoing political context in NepalA screen shot of public debate within Nepal would reveal a widespread belief that the constitutional amendment was being used by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli to hold on to his position within the Nepal Communist Party, which was highly shaky in early May when pressure on him to vacate the Prime Minister’s post had become unbearable.Also Read: Nepal parliament clears new map, shuts possibility of talks on boundary rowThere were saner voices in Kathmandu that advised him not to bring the constitutional amendment. On the contrary, PM Oli was told, that the constitution amendment bill would close the channels of diplomatic communication with India. On the diplomatic dialogue to discuss the outstanding boundary issue, Nepal seems to have adopted a twin approach. A public call for dialogue combined with an active private effort to scuttle it.In public pronouncements, including in response to questions of lawmakers in Parliament on the status of dialogue with India, Foreign Minister Pradeep Kumar Gyawali had expressed surprise that India was sitting down for talks with China but was ignoring Nepal’s offer for talks. Why indeed has India not offered to sit down for talks? Has it actually snubbed Nepal’s request, as Pradeep Kumar Gyawali seems to claim.Also Read: In 4 sentences, Army chief hints India’s approach to Nepal after map rowA top foreign ministry source in Kathmandu, however, told Hindustan Times that this wasn’t accurate.The source said India had made a clear-cut offer of a foreign secretary-level phone call; to be followed by a video conference between the two foreign secretaries and then, a visit of Nepal’s foreign secretary to India to discuss the boundary issue.External affairs ministry sources in New Delhi confirmed that this offer was available with foreign minister Gyawali and Prime Minister Oli even before the constitution amendment bill was tabled.This offer was made a full one week before foreign minister Gyawali stated that India has been snubbing Nepal’s requests for talks on the border issue.Only foreign minister Gyawali can answer if an offer of a phone call, a video conference and exchange of visits a snub as he described it.Nepal’s foreign ministry sources confirmed that Prime Minister Oli seemed disinterested in India’s offer. For reasons best known to him, he was neither ready to halt nor take a step back on the constitutional amendment despite knowing that the constitutional amendment is viewed by India as an irrevocable step which predetermines the outcome of any future negotiations. Indeed, according to some interlocutors, in his private meetings, Prime Minister Oli has reportedly conveyed that he would proceed ahead with the amendment irrespective of the impact it might have on people-to-people relations between India and Nepal.What we seem to have here is a carefully crafted pattern of deceit and deception where the Indian offer is not shared with Parliamentarians; and public and lawmakers are misled - all so that PM Oli can damage the special relationship that the people of the two countries continue to nurture. Given that PM Oli has ignored that offer of diplomatic dialogue and gone ahead with amending the constitution, it is now up to him to create, if he so wishes, a conducive atmosphere in case he is interested in a bilateral dialogue on the boundary issue. A leader of PM Oli’s experience and wisdom would know well that the time for verbal fudging is over; he now needs to walk the talk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/why-pm-oli-rejected-india-s-offer-for-dialogue/story-REZvZfQDb2tySTGjEMh3gL.html
