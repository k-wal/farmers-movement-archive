A plan in the early 2000s by former Prime Minister Tony Blair to buy a government jet — dubbed “Blair Force One” — was later scrapped to save money.The Voyager also carries other senior ministers and members of the royal family on overseas trips, and is used by the air force for air-to-air refueling.Johnson complained in 2018 about the drab official plane, asking “why does it have to be gray?” and saying he would like a “Brexit plane” to help promote the U.K. around the world.Johnson’s office said the paint job, estimated to cost 900,000 pounds, wouldn’t affect the plane’s military role.But opposition Labour Party lawmaker Louise Haigh questioned the wisdom of “spending almost a million pounds redecorating a plane which in all likelihood has been grounded for months because of the coronavirus” pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-royal-air-force-plane-gets-red-white-and-blue-makeover/story-XhwFCaac8nhOwHEZ87T7gI.html

No one was hurt.Footage posted on social media showed a man step running toward the silver Jaguar as it drove out of the gates of Parliament accompanied by a police motorcycle outrider and a Range Rover support vehicle.Johnson’s car braked suddenly and was hit from behind by the Range Rover, sustaining a large dent. It paused for a moment before the motorcade moved on.The prime minister’s office confirmed Johnson was in the car and said there were no reports of any injuries.Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said at a news conference that Johnson was “wholly unscathed.”The protester, who was knocked to the ground in the incident, was detained by police. The Metropolitan Police said he was arrested on suspicion of public order offenses and for “obstructing the highway.”Several groups were protesting outside Parliament in small numbers on Wednesday, including anti-Brexit and pro-Kurdish groups. Johnson was returning to his office at 10 Downing St. from his weekly question-and-answer session with lawmakers when the crash happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-runs-into-a-minor-car-crash-after-protestor-blocks-it/story-NgEcH34T4ZGgUToiQcNGuO.html
17-06-2020||World||New video offers closer view of police SUV hitting black man||A second video has emerged that appears to show a police SUV driven by a white suburban St. Louis police officer striking a black suspect and knocking the man to the ground as he screams out in pain.Florissant detective Joshua Smith was fired on June 10, eight days after the arrest that occurred during protests and unrest over the police killing of George Floyd in Minnesota. Home security video posted online shortly after the arrest led to an investigation by a special prosecutor that is ongoing.The new video, which was provided by attorneys for the man who was struck, offers a closer view and a different angle that shows the moment of impact. It also includes audio of the man screaming in pain after the SUV appears to drive across a front lawn and strike him.“When you see the second video it’s clear that he intentionally ran into him and used the vehicle as a weapon,” the man’s attorney, Jerryl T. Christmas, said Wednesday. “It’s difficult to watch, and difficult to listen to the audio because of the way he’s screaming and hollering.”Smith’s attorney, Scott Rosenblum, has said what happened was an accident.The special prosecutor, Tim Lohmar, scheduled a news conference for late Wednesday morning. He did not specify in a statement that charges would be filed.Florissant is just north of Ferguson, Missouri, where Michael Brown’s death at the hands of a white police officer in 2014 was a catalyst for the national Black Lives Matter movement. The St. Louis region has been the site of dozens of protests since Floyd’s May 25 death in Minneapolis.Florissant Police Chief Timothy Fagan has said Smith was on duty the night of June 2 because of civil unrest in the area following protests. A day earlier, four St. Louis police officers were shot and a retired St. Louis police captain was fatally shot during a violent night in the city.Officers were pursuing the vehicle occupied by three men because it had been seen near an earlier shots-fired incident, Florissant Mayor Tim Lowery said.St. Louis County police said the arrest happened around 11:30 p.m. in Dellwood, another suburb near Florissant. The first video was from a resident’s doorbell camera and posted online by media outlet Real STL news. Christmas said the second video also came from a home security system.It shows a car slowing on a residential street. Two men in the front seat jump out of the still rolling car, then a third man jumps out of the back seat.The unmarked police SUV appears from behind the car and drives across part of a front lawn, striking the third man and knocking him onto the driveway. He immediately cries out in pain. An officer gets out of the SUV and appears to kick and hit the man on the ground as the man yells out, “OK! OK! OK!” and repeatedly says, “I don’t have nothing,” likely meaning he doesn’t have a weapon.Christmas said police had no probable cause to follow the men in the first place and accused the officers of racial profiling.Fagan said the man was treated at a hospital for an ankle injury. Christmas said his injuries were far worse, that the man’s leg was “shattered” and required multiple surgeries.“He was traumatized,” Christmas said.Fagan said police are seeking municipal charges for possession of drug paraphernalia and resisting arrest against all three men. No weapons were found on the men or in their car.In addition to Lohmar’s investigation, U.S. Attorney Jeff Jensen said his office, the Civil Rights Division at the Department of Justice and the FBI also are reviewing the case to determine if a federal response is warranted.Lohmar, speaking last week, called the video “shocking” but said it showed only part of the encounter.“What I saw is not standard police work, it is not acceptable police work,” he said.The arrest led to several peaceful protests outside of police headquarters in Florissant, including a “die-in” in which participants lay face down with their hands behind their backs. A few dozen protesters also gathered Monday outside Lohmar’s office urging prosecution of Smith.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-video-offers-closer-view-of-police-suv-hitting-black-man/story-hJiRlhBkcK6omyMxDJRg4N.html
17-06-2020||World||WHO says more understanding needed on steroid dexamethasone||The emergencies chief of the World Health Organization welcomed the news this week that dexamethasone, a cheap steroid, was shown in a British trial to reduce deaths among patients critically ill with the coronavirus, but said it was too soon to change how patients are treated.“It’s one of the breakthroughs we’re going to need to effectively deal with COVID-19, but it’s still preliminary data,” said Dr. Michael Ryan at a press briefing on Wednesday. “We will pull together the necessary expert group... and come to a decision around our clinical advice to countries.”Ryan said that “this is not the time to rush to change clinical practice” and that it was crucial to understand issues like what dose should be used on patients, how patients would be assessed and if there were adequate supplies of the drug.On Tuesday, when the British researchers announced their findings, the department of health said the dexamethasone had been approved to treat all hospitalized COVID-19 patients, effectively immediately.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus noted that in the last two months, more than 6 million coronavirus cases have been logged and said cases were still accelerating globally. In the first two months, only 85,000 cases were reported, mostly from China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-more-understanding-needed-on-steroid-dexamethasone/story-L7IlwsdOpcR0fKXcGu0qnL.html
17-06-2020||World||Bangladesh launches clinical trial of two-drug combination to treat Covid-19||Bangladesh on Wednesday launched the clinical trial of combination of anti-parasitic and antibiotic vaccines to treat Covid-19 after getting positive results in patients administered with the mix of two drugs.Bangladesh-based International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research (ICCDR’B) said the trial would be conducted on 72 infected patients in four hospitals treating Covid-19 in Dhaka, while “the study has commenced in Kurmitola General Hospital and Mugda Medical College and Hospital and discussions with others are underway.” “Today, ICCDR has started a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of anti-parasitic medicine Ivermectin in combination with antibiotic doxycycline or Ivermectin alone,” the centre said in a statement.A Bangladeshi doctors’ team led by senior medicine specialist Professor Tarek Alam prescribed the combination as it initially cured within days all the 60 Covid-19 patients who were administered with the drugs.According to the ICDDR’B, the study will include Covid-19 patients between 40-65 years of age with mild illness for less than seven days.One group of participants will receive a single dose Ivermectin along with five doses of doxycycline, while another group will receive Ivermectin alone once a day for five days, while the third group will receive a placebo for five days.The test medicine and placebo will be packaged identically and neither the participants nor the physicians will have the knowledge about who is receiving which treatment.According to a statement by the ICDDR’B, a panel of international and local experts were involved with this clinical trial which will be concluded in next two months.The ICDDR’s announcement came hours after the country’s healthcare authorities said experts concerned were asked to quicken examinations on the efficacy of a two-drug combination and studies on it were underway in line with medical protocols.Nearly 100,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 in Bangladesh, while approximately 1,305 patients have died, 43 of them in the last 24 hours.The centre said their study, being supported by Bangladesh’s leading drug maker Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd, aimed to understand the virological clearance rate and days required for remission of fever and cough by “using Ivermectin with or without doxycycline.” “It will also try to understand the changes in oxygen requirement, reasons for patients failing to maintain oxygen saturation (SpO2) above 88 per cent despite oxygenation, changes in number of days on oxygen support and hospitalisation, and causes of mortality,” the statement read.Beximco Pharma Managing Director Nazmul Hassan called the proposed clinical trial “well designed” and first such randomised experiment in the country.“Should the outcomes be positive from this trial, as well as other ongoing trials in different countries, Ivermectin can offer itself as a highly affordable and readily available solution for the Covid-19 pandemic,” he said.US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) earlier approved Ivermectin as a drug for parasitic infections while it has been in use since 1980 and according to ICDDR’B, it is previously shown to have “broad-spectrum anti-viral activity in vitro”.Director General of Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) Abul Kalam Azad earlier said that once a technical study team of his office gave a go ahead, the combination drugs would be prescribed for “limited-scale application” among Covid-19 patients.He said ahead of a massive-scale application or widened use to treat Covid-19 patients, the combination would have to exhaust clinical trials under the supervision of regulatory Bangladesh Medical Research Council (BMRC).“These are low-cost drugs, Bangladesh will be proud, if the combination is proven effective against the coronavirus,” said Health Ministry’s additional secretary Habibur Rahman Rahman.Head of medicine of private Bangladesh Medical College Hospital (BMCH) Alam led the team in experimenting the combination which, he said worked very well for mild and moderate cases of coronavirus.He said the team now wanted to see the combination’s effectiveness on patients with severe coronavirus infections administering them with increased doses of medicines.Doctors at different facilities said they were unofficially using the matching, observing their effectiveness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-launches-clinical-trial-of-two-drug-combination-to-treat-covid-19/story-h4hzHmF9UWPwcWTTE9seCM.html
17-06-2020||World||Beijing cancels flights, shuts schools over new coronavirus outbreak||Beijing’s airports cancelled two-thirds of all flights on Wednesday and schools in the Chinese capital were closed again as authorities rushed to contain a new coronavirus outbreak and warned infections may rise.The city reported 31 new cases while officials urged residents not to leave Beijing, with fears growing about a second wave of infections in China, which had largely brought the contagion under control since its emergence in Wuhan late last year.Hundreds of thousands of people have been tested so far following the fresh outbreak, which is believed to have started in the sprawling Xinfadi wholesale food market.Almost 30 residential compounds in the city are now under lockdown.“Because the Xinfadi market is the largest marketplace selling daily necessities, with thousands of migrant workers and a large number of visitors, it is hard to control the spread,” said Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention.“We may see a rise in confirmed cases in the coming days,” Pang told a regular press briefing.Beijing has reported 137 infections over the past six days and 95 percent of them were “mild cases”, Pang said.The city has ramped up its testing capacity and is gathering about 400,000 samples a day, said Zhang Qiang, an official from Beijing’s epidemic prevention task force.Since June 13, 356,000 samples have been tested. That includes swabs from workers and visitors to different markets in Beijing and communities near to spots where outbreaks have been registered.A shortage of expensive testing machines has led to delays in processing.At least 1,255 scheduled flights were cancelled Wednesday, state-run People’s Daily reported -- nearly 70 percent of all trips to and from Beijing’s main airports.The outbreak had already forced authorities to announce a travel ban for residents of “medium- or high-risk” areas of the city, while requiring all other residents to take nucleic acid tests in order to leave Beijing.Several provinces were quarantining travellers from Beijing, where all schools -- which had mostly reopened -- have been ordered to close again and return to online classes.- Markets closed -Officials have closed 11 markets and disinfected thousands of food and beverage businesses in Beijing after the outbreak was detected.In addition to the cluster in Beijing, two domestic cases -- one in neighbouring Hebei province and another in the eastern province of Zhejiang -- were reported Wednesday, while there were 11 imported cases.A local case was also reported in Tianjin, a large city located just outside Beijing to the southeast, state television announced late in the day.The 22-year-old man, a hotel restaurant worker, reportedly had not left Tianjin in the two weeks before displaying symptoms -- fueling speculation about another possible cluster.Authorities have so far banned group sports, ordered people to wear masks in crowded enclosed spaces, and suspended inter-provincial group tours in response to the outbreak.Bars in Beijing’s trendy Sanlitun area were ordered to shut down, while shops were seeing lighter foot traffic.Officials said that since May 30, more than 200,000 people had visited Xinfadi market, which supplies more than 70 percent of Beijing’s fruit and vegetables.Until the new outbreak, most of China’s recent cases were nationals returning from abroad as Covid-19 spread globally, and the government had all but declared victory against the disease.China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that the virus type found in the Beijing outbreak was a “major epidemic strain” in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-cancels-flights-shuts-schools-over-new-coronavirus-outbreak/story-Ty4A34HX0EEkgIxFRdrdaO.html
17-06-2020||World||US ‘closely monitoring’ India-China border situation||The United States has said it is “closely monitoring” the India-China border situation and an American media report suggested China may have suffered severe losses in the eastern Ladakh clashes and put the number of its fatalities at 35 citing an intelligence assessment. US News, the media publication, went on to suggest that the Chinese are taking the deaths as a humiliation and might be reluctant, therefore, to announce or confirm them for fear of emboldening other adversaries.In the reported assessment of US intelligence it was a tense border meeting between military personnel of the two sides to de-escalate tensions that turned violent. Most deaths were caused by batons, knives or from falling off a steep cliff. The details of this account of events could not be ascertained independently.The state department pointed to an earlier statement when asked. A spokesperson had said: “We are closely monitoring the situation between Indian and Chinese forces along the Line of Actual Control. We note the Indian military has announced that 20 soldiers have died, and we offer our condolences to their families. Both India and China have expressed a desire to de-escalate, and we support a peaceful resolution of the current situation.”The spokesperson had gone on to refer to a June 2 phone call in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Donald Trump had discussed the India-China border.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany told reporters at the daily briefing President Donald Trump is aware of the situation on the India-China border, and went on to repeat a statement earlier issued by the state department spokesperson: “We are closely monitoring the situation between Indian and Chinese forces along the Line of Actual Control. We note the Indian military has announced that 20 soldiers have died, and we offer our condolences to their families. Both India and China have expressed a desire to de-escalate, and we support a peaceful resolution of the current situation.”The spokesperson had gone on to refer to a June 2 phone call in which Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Trump had discussed the India-China border.President Trump had earlier, on May 28, offered to mediate the dispute, saying in a tweet, “We have informed both India and China that the United States is ready, willing and able to mediate or arbitrate their now raging border dispute.” The offer was turned down by both India and China and Trump has since not said more on this, snowed under as he is with the twin crises of the Covid-19 epidemic that has killed nearly 117,000 Americans and the civil unrest triggered by the killing of an Africa-American man by a white police officer in Minneapolis.The state department had earlier slammed the border tensions as a reflection of Chinese aggression going beyond the rhetoric and the House foreign affairs committee had blamed the Chinese for as well.“I am extremely concerned by the ongoing Chinese aggression along the Line of Actual Control on the India-China border.,” Eliot Engel, the chairman of the House foreign affairs committee, had said in a statement in early June. “China is demonstrating once again that it is willing to bully its neighbors rather than resolve conflicts according to international law.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-closely-monitoring-india-china-border-situation/story-z8teSFt30K38Ee3qwIyx9K.html
17-06-2020||World||‘Black lives do not matter’ in US: George Floyd’s brother tells UN||George Floyd’s brother on Wednesday begged the United Nations to help African Americans because “black lives do not matter in the United States”, as the UN’s rights chief urged reparations for centuries of discrimination.Philonise Floyd made an impassioned speech via video-link to an urgent United Nations Human Rights Council debate on “systemic racism” in the US and beyond.Michelle Bachelet, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the “gratuitous brutality” of Floyd’s death in police custody encapsulated racism that harmed millions of people of African descent.She also urged countries to confront the legacy of slavery and colonialism and to make reparations.The council, based in Geneva, is debating a draft resolution pushing for Bachelet to investigate racism and police civil liberties violations against people of African descent in the United States.President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from the council two years ago.Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, died in Minneapolis on May 25 after a white police officer -- since charged with murder -- pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes.Amateur video of the incident sparked demonstrations and calls to address systemic racism in the United States and around the world.Philonise Floyd said his brother had been “tortured to death” as witnesses begged the officer to stop, “showing us black people the same lesson, yet again: black lives do not matter in the United States of America”.“You in the United Nations are your brothers’ and sisters’ keepers in America, and you have the power to help us get justice for my brother George Floyd.”“I am asking you to help him. I am asking you to help me. I am asking you to help us black people in America.”He urged them to establish an independent international commission of inquiry -- one of the UN’s highest-level probes, generally reserved for major crises like the Syrian conflict.- Probe proposal dropped -An initial text presented on Tuesday on behalf of 54 African countries had proposed such an inquiry.But the proposal was dropped, the resolution heavily watered down following stark opposition from Washington and some of its allies.But the proposal was dropped, the resolution heavily watered down following stark opposition from Washington and some of its allies.It now calls on Bachelet and UN rights experts to “establish the facts and circumstances relating to the systemic racism, alleged violations of international human rights law and abuses against Africans and people of African descent” by law enforcement in the US and beyond -- especially those incidents that resulted in deaths.The aim, it said, was “to ensure the accountability of perpetrators and redress for victims”.In her statement to the council, Bachelet said Floyd’s death had brought to head the sense of outrage felt by overlooked people and the protests were “the culmination of many generations of pain”.“Behind today’s racial violence, systemic racism, and discriminatory policing lies the failure to acknowledge and confront the legacy of the slave trade and colonialism,” the former Chilean president said.She stressed the need to “make amends for centuries of violence and discrimination, including through formal apologies, truth-telling processes, and reparations in various forms.”- US call for transparency -On Tuesday, Trump issued an order to improve policing, calling for a ban on dangerous choke holds -- except if an officer’s life is at risk.The executive order encourages de-escalation training, better recruitment, sharing of data on police who have bad records, and money to support police in complicated duties related to people with mental or drug issues.However, it stopped well short of demands made at nationwide protests.Andrew Bremberg, the US ambassador to the UN in Geneva, said his country was open in its commitment to addressing racial discrimination and injustice, citing Trump’s executive order.“We call upon all governments to demonstrate the same level of transparency and accountability,” he said.“Sadly, there are too many places in the world where governments commit grave violations of human rights and practice systematic racial discrimination while many of those assembled in Geneva are silent.”It remains to be seen whether the current draft resolution will pass.Australia, South Korea and the Netherlands all issued statements in the chamber that were broadly supportive of Washington’s outlook.“We have confidence in their transparent justice systems to address these issues appropriately,” Australia’s representative said.The UN Human Rights Council’s 47 members are due to vote on the resolution following the urgent debate, which was set to conclude on Thursday.Wednesday marks only the fifth time in the council’s 14-year history that it has agreed to hold an “urgent debate”, which is like a special session, but within a regular session of the council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-do-not-matter-in-us-george-floyd-s-brother-tells-un/story-bjkN5SC5sJV5D5dDuQac5J.html

At the time, Seazen Group was China’s eighth-largest property developer by sales; it has since slipped to 13th place.The Putuo District People’s Court in Shanghai issued the verdict after a two-day closed-door hearing, according to a statement published on its official WeChat account. Five years is the maximum jail term for child molestation.Reuters was not able to reach Wang or Seazen Group for comment.Wang’s son, non-executive director Wang Xiaosong, was appointed chairman of Seazen Group’s board after his father’s arrest last year. Seazen Group’s subsidiaries include Seazen Holdings Co Ltd and property management unit S-Enjoy Service Group Co Ltd.However, Wang Zhenhua continues to hold about 70% of Seazen Group. The 2020 Hurun Global Rich List in March estimated Wang and his son’s net worth at around $6.1 billion.Seazen sold some of its land parcels shortly after Wang’s arrest to improve its cash flow amid lenders’ worries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-property-billionaire-gets-5-years-jail-for-child-molestation/story-ZbZ3xT9bu5M1Zjqh4Pvp1O.html
17-06-2020||World||Beijing’s new Covid-19 outbreak raises fears for rest of the world||China raised its emergency warning to its second highest level and canceled more than 60% of the flights to Beijing on Wednesday amid a new coronavirus outbreak in the capital — a sharp pullback for the nation that declared victory over the virus in March and a warning for the rest of the world about how tenacious this virus really is.New infections spiked in India, Iran and US states including Florida, Texas and Arizona as authorities struggled to balance restarting economic activity without accelerating the spread of the pandemic.European nations, which embarked on a widescale reopening this week, looked on with trepidation as the Americas struggled mightily to contain the first wave of the pandemic and Asian nations like China and South Korea reported new outbreaks, giving rise to fears of a second wave.In China, officials described the situation in Beijing as “extremely grave.”“This has truly rung an alarm bell for us,” Party Secretary Cai Qi told a meeting of Beijing’s Communist Party Standing Committee.The party’s Global Times said 1,255 flights to and from the capital’s two major airports were scrapped by Wednesday morning, about two-thirds of those scheduled. Beijing Capital Airport is traditionally the world’s second busiest in passenger capacity.Since the virus emerged in China late last year and spread worldwide, there have been more than 8.1 million confirmed cases and at least 443,000 deaths, according to a tally kept by Johns Hopkins University. Experts say the true toll is much higher, due to the many who died without being tested and other factors.The US has the most infections and deaths in the world, with a toll that neared 117,000 on Wednesday, surpassing the number of Americans who died in World War I. In a worrying development since the US hurricane season began this month, the virus has even sidelined some members of a US team that tracks hurricanes.Arizona reported a new daily high of nearly 2,400 new infections for a total of more than 39,000, while in Texas, Governor Greg Abbott insisted that the state’s health care system could handle the fast-rising number of new coronavirus cases and hospitalizations.Tuesday marked the eighth time in nine days that Texas set a new high for Covid-19 hospitalizations at 2,518. State health officials also reported 2,622 new cases, a single-day high.“It does raise concerns, but there is no reason right now to be alarmed,” Abbott said.Texas began aggressively re-opening its economy on May 1 and Abbott has continued to relax restrictions. He noted that Texans may have become lax in wearing masks or practicing social distancing and urged people to stay home as much as possible.In Oregon, a rural northeastern church has become the epicenter of the state’s largest coronavirus outbreak, as 236 people tested positive. The outbreak also led to Oregon’s second consecutive record-setting daily case count.Canada and the US, meanwhile, decided to extend to July 21 a deal to keep their border closed to nonessential travel, with many Canadians fearing cases arriving from the US“This is a decision that will protect people on both sides of the border as we continue to fight Covid-19,” Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said.As the US struggles with the first wave of the virus, other countries where it was widely thought to be under control faced disturbing developments.In South Korea, authorities reported 43 new cases amid increased public activity. Authorities said 25 of them came from the Seoul metropolitan area, where hundreds of infections have been linked to nightclubs, church gatherings, e-commerce workers and door-to-door salespeople. Twelve of the new cases were linked to international arrivals.Not long after declaring itself virus-free, New Zealand is dealing with a reemergence of the virus. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern assigned a top military leader to oversee the border quarantines after what she described as an “unacceptable failure” by health officials.They had allowed two New Zealand citizens who had recently returned from London to leave quarantine before being tested to see a dying relative. After the women tested positive, New Zealand began tracing their potential contacts to ensure the virus is contained.Their cases raised the specter that international air travel could ignite a new surge of the virus just as countries are reopening airports to boost their devastated tourism industries.The flight cancellations in China were among a number of travel limits placed around the capital. Beijing had essentially eradicated local transmissions until recent days, with 137 new cases since last week.On Wednesday, the city of 20 million people raised its threat level from 3 to 2, leading to the cancellation of classes, suspended reopenings and stronger requirements for social distancing. China had relaxed many coronavirus controls after the Communist Party declared victory over the virus in March.India — which has the fourth-highest caseload after the US, Brazil and Russia — added more than 2,000 deaths to its tally, after Delhi and Maharashtra states included 1,672 previously unreported fatalities. Its death toll of 11,903 is now eighth highest in the world. India has been reporting some 10,000 new infections and more than 300 deaths each day for the last two weeks.In Europe, which has seen over 184,000 virus-related deaths, Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez announced that a ceremony will be held on July 16 to honor the country’s more than 27,000 dead.Denmark’s health minister urged anyone who joined a large protest against racial injustice on June 7 to be tested “whether you have symptoms or not” after one person in the crowd tested positive.“As long as we have the virus in Europe and in Denmark, it will flare up. We are dealing with a very, very contagious disease,” said Health Minister Magnus Heunicke.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-s-new-covid-19-outbreak-raises-fears-for-rest-of-the-world/story-n6xlRbPR91Wd0XCFoYYF6M.html

17-06-2020||World||CureVac coronavirus vaccine cleared for human trials in Germany||Germany’s CureVac AG won approval to start human trials of a novel coronavirus vaccine just days after the company secured backing from Chancellor Angela Merkel’s government.Regulators gave the company the green light to test the shot in first-phase trials on 168 healthy people, according to a statement on Wednesday. It’s the second such treatment to go into clinical testing in Germany.CureVac’s product is based on an unproven but promising area of pharmaceutical development known as messenger RNA, in which the vaccine teaches the body’s cells to identify and attack the virus. It’s slightly behind that of front-runners Moderna Inc. of the U.S. and BioNTech SE, a local rival, in terms of potential speed to market.As worldwide coronavirus cases top 8 million, governments, investors and the public are keenly watching the race to deliver vaccines that could prevent future infections. Dozens of candidates are being developed in nations from the U.S. to the U.K. and China, with several in human trials, according to the World Health Organization.Germany this week announced a plan to buy 23% of Tuebingen-based CureVac for 300 million euros ($338 million) as Merkel’s government tries to secure a supply of any successful pandemic shot.The company has been considering following Moderna and BioNTech onto the stock market, Chief Financial Officer Pierre Kemula said in an interview with Bloomberg Television on Monday, though no firm plans are in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/curevac-coronavirus-vaccine-cleared-for-human-trials-in-germany/story-xDB4p04r7nRRIr1cxhp5GI.html
17-06-2020||World||Combination of self-isolation, testing, contact tracing needed for containing pandemic: Lancet study||In the absence of a vaccine or highly effective treatments for Covid-19, scientists believe that a combination of measures such as intensive testing, and contact tracing along with physical distancing and remote working are needed to contain the pandemic.According to a new modelling research, published in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases, combining intensive contact tracing along with physical distancing measures may be the most efficient way to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. It noted that a high incidence of Covid-19 would require a considerable number of individuals to be quarantined to control infection. Citing an example, the researchers, including those from the University of Cambridge in the UK, said if about 5,000 new symptomatic cases were diagnosed each day, it may require 1,50,000-2,00,000 contacts to be quarantined every day if no physical distancing was in place. They said the study is the first to use social contact data to quantify the potential impact of control measures on reducing individual-level transmission of SARS-CoV-2 in specific settings. In the study, researchers analysed data on how 40,162 people moved about the UK and interacted with others prior to Covid-19. Based on this, they simulated how combinations of different testing, isolation, tracing, and physical distancing scenarios such as app- based tracing, remote working, limits on different sized gatherings, and mass population-based testing might contribute to reducing secondary cases. They aimed to identify not only what would theoretically control transmission, but also what the practical implications of these measures would be. However, they said the model is based on a series of assumptions about the effectiveness of testing, tracing, isolation, and quarantine. They assumed that the amount of time it takes to isolate cases with symptoms was on average 2.6 days, and the likelihood that their contacts adhere to quarantine was 90 per cent. According to the scientists, while these considerations are plausible, they are optimistic assumptions. “Our findings reinforce the growing body of evidence which suggests that we can’t rely on one single public health measure to achieve epidemic control”, said Adam Kucharski, study co-author from the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine in the UK. “Successful strategies will likely include intensive testing and contact tracing supplemented with moderate forms of physical distancing, such as limiting the size of social gatherings and remote working, which can both reduce transmission and the number of contacts that need to be traced,” Kucharski said. The huge scale of testing and contact tracing needed to reduce Covid-19 from spreading is resource intensive, the researchers said, adding that app- based tracing, if adopted widely alongside traditional contact tracing, could enhance the effectiveness of identifying contacts. In the research, the scientists also modelled the rate at which the virus is transmitted -- known as the reproductive number (R), or the average number of people each individual with the virus is likely to infect at a given moment -- under different strategies. They said, to keep the Covid-19 pandemic declining, R value needed to be less than one. In the model, the researchers assumed the probability that a close contact of a confirmed case will be infected to be 20 per cent among household contacts and 6 per cent among other contacts. They estimated that if no control measures had been implemented, R would be 2.6, meaning that one infected person would infect, on average, 2-3 more people. According to the model, mass testing alone, with 5 per cent of the population undergoing random testing each week can lower R to just 2.5, because so many infections would either be missed or detected too late. Compared with no control measures, self-isolation of symptomatic cases alone reduced transmission by an estimated 29 per cent, while combining self-isolation, household quarantine, and tracing strategies may lower transmission by as much as 47 per cent when using app-based contact tracing. Limiting daily contacts outside home, school, and work to four people along with manual tracing of acquaintances only, and app-based tracing, would have the greatest impact, reducing disease spread by 66 per cent, and lowering R to 0.87, the study noted. However, the scientists said the effectiveness of manual contact tracing strategies is highly dependent on how many contacts are successfully traced, with a high level of tracing required to ensure R is lower than one. They also modelled the number of contacts that needed to be quarantined under different contact tracing strategies.A scenario in which 1,000 new symptomatic cases were reported daily would likely require a minimum of 15,000 contacts quarantined every day and a maximum of 41,000 people, the researchers added. “Our results highlight several characteristics of SARS-CoV-2 which make effective isolation and contact tracing challenging,” said study co-author Hannah Fry from the University College London in the UK. “The high rate of transmission, the short time between one person becoming infected and infecting another, and transmission that occurs without symptoms all make things difficult,” Fry said. For high numbers of symptomatic Covid-19 cases, tracing, testing, quarantining efforts will be a big challenge, the scientists said. “If combined with moderate physical distancing measures, self-isolation and contact tracing would be more likely to achieve control of Covid-19,” the scientists concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/combination-of-self-isolation-testing-contact-tracing-needed-for-containing-pandemic-lancet-study/story-vifNmbhuJbvua78OrNkhUI.html

A large number of cases aren’t being reported because of low testing and as reasons other than respiratory failure aren’t being counted in deaths, he said.Pakistan’s coronavirus cases have increased manifold since the government eased a lockdown in the second week of May after a partial shutdown of about two months. Khan has said he is allowing some businesses to open as he fears people will die of poverty and hunger instead of the virus. Alarmed by the rising number of cases, the authorities have again started shutting down residential localities in 20 key cities including Lahore, the second-biggest, and Islamabad, the capital.Pakistan is the second most infected nation in Asia after India with 154,760 cases and about 3,000 deaths. The fatality rate of 2% is less than half of the 5% global average.“Virus testing is too low and random testing virtually doesn’t exist,” Rahman said, whose task force is advising the government on developing protective equipment. “The government data is only based on tests being carried out on those people who report symptoms.”The nation expects infected people to rise almost eight times to 1.2 million by the end of July, according to Asad Umar, planning minister who is overseeing the nation’s coronavirus nerve center.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-understating-covid-19-infections-and-deaths-says-report/story-BlI3WwMk93FRhXXQpVg97O.html
17-06-2020||World||Taiwan to ease virus border controls to let in some business people||Taiwan will from the start of next week ease border controls put in place to prevent the spread of the coronavirus and will allow in business travellers from some lower-risk countries, though they will have to be tested and quarantined.Taiwan has never gone into total lockdown and life has continued largely as normal due to its early and effective prevention work and a first-rate public health system.While it has largely lifted domestic restrictions, Taiwan has been more cautious about opening up its borders, which have been shut to most foreign visitors since mid-March.Taiwan’s Central Epidemic Command Centre said starting from Monday it would allow in business people coming from lower-risk areas including New Zealand, Australia, Vietnam and Thailand, plus those from South Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong and Macau, which it judged medium to low risk.Travellers will have to provide details of where they are going in Taiwan, be able to provide proof of testing negative for the virus three days before flying, and prove they have been invited by a company, the centre said on Wednesday. They will still be subject to 14 days of quarantine, as are all those coming into Taiwan, but will be able to shorten that if they pay for a coronavirus test and test negative. “To foster the opening of foreign business activities in a timely manner, we are announcing the relaxation of some border control measures,” Health Minister Chen Shih-chung told reporters.“We will simplify quarantine measures, starting from low risks areas.”International flights have continued to operate to and from Taiwan throughout the border restrictions, though on a much reduced scale. Previously the only foreigners allowed in where those with residence permits, diplomats and a few other exceptions.Taiwan has reported 445 cases, the majority of which were in people who get infected overseas, and just seven deaths. It has only four active cases remaining.

17-06-2020||World||China extraditions possible under new security law in Hong Kong: Report||China’s planned national security law for Hong Kong could allow for extraditions to the mainland, the city’s sole representative to Beijing’s top lawmaking body said Wednesday.The comments by Tam Yiu-chung, a veteran pro-Beijing politician, are significant because it was the threat of extradition to China’s party-controlled courts that ignited last year’s explosive pro-democracy protests.The semi-autonomous business hub has been convulsed by a year of huge and often violent rallies that began with an eventually aborted criminal extradition bill but morphed into a popular call for democracy and police accountability.Beijing says the new national security law is needed to end the political unrest and restore stability. But critics see it as potential knock-out blow for Hong Kong’s cherished freedoms and autonomy. In an interview with RTHK radio on Wednesday, Tam said he believed some prosecutions alleging foreign interference, or cases involving diplomatic issues, could be handled by China’s central government.Asked if that might result in Hong Kongers extradited to the mainland for trial he replied: “If the central government thinks it is necessary to do so, not to be handled in Hong Kong courts, then that is an option.”Tam’s comments come after Deng Zhonghua, the deputy of China’s Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, said Monday that Beijing will have jurisdiction over some “extremely rare” national security cases once the law is passed.Under a “One Country, Two Systems” agreement ahead of the handover by Britain, China agreed to let Hong Kong maintain certain liberties and autonomy until 2047 -- including legislative and judicial independence.Critics fear the new law -- which will bypass Hong Kong’s legislature -- will demolish that separation, and say Beijing has been prematurely eroding the city’s freedoms for years.Beijing denies those allegations and argues that national security is within its purview.The Standing Committee, the party organ that will draw up the new law, is sitting on Thursday and Friday. So far Chinese state media reports have not listed Hong Kong as part of the agenda but Beijing has said it wants the law passed quickly. On Wednesday a group of 86 NGOs and rights groups -- including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House -- published a joint letter to the Standing Committee calling on it to scrap the proposed law. “Everything we know about it so far suggests it will threaten the basic rights and freedoms of people in Hong Kong.” the letter said. “It criminalises broad, vague ‘offences’ that can encompass any criticism of the government and be used against people peacefully exercising and defending their human rights,” it added. Peaceful protests in Hong Kong have rekindled since China announced the proposed law, albeit on a smaller scale. Riot police have moved quickly against such rallies, citing anti-coronavirus measures banning large public gatherings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-extraditions-possible-under-new-security-law-in-hong-kong-report/story-TKyT12mo2xRPgAPgYoYnBO.html

17-06-2020||World||Trump administration sues to delay release of Bolton book||The Trump administration sued former national security adviser John Bolton on Tuesday to delay the publication of a book that the White House says contains classified information and that is expected to paint an unfavorable portrait of the president’s foreign policy decision-making.The civil lawsuit in Washington’s federal court follows warnings from President Donald Trump that Bolton could face a “criminal problem” if he doesn’t halt plans to publish the book, which is scheduled for release next week.The complaint is the latest salvo in a contentious relationship between Trump and the hawkish Bolton, who was abruptly forced from the White House in January after repeated disagreements on national security matters. It moves their rift into court, where a judge will be asked to decide whether Bolton short-circuited proper procedures to get his book on the market — something his lawyer and publisher have strongly denied.His publisher, Simon & Schuster, called the lawsuit “nothing more than the latest in a long running series of efforts by the administration to quash publication of a book it deems unflattering to the president.” It said in a statement Tuesday evening that Bolton had worked with White House officials to address their concerns, and that it “fully supports his First Amendment right” to tell his story.Similarly, Bolton’s attorney, Chuck Cooper, has said Bolton worked for months with classification specialists to avoid releasing classified material. He has accused the White House of using national security information as a pretext to censor Bolton.In its lawsuit, the Justice Department administration contends that the former adviser did not complete a pre-publication review to ensure that the manuscript did not contain classified material. It requests that a federal court order Bolton to “instruct or request” that his publisher further delay publication of the book to allow for a completion of the national security review process and to “retrieve and dispose” of existing copies in a manner acceptable to the government.The Justice Department also is asking a federal court to grant it the rights to all proceeds Bolton earns from the publication of the book.In its lawsuit, the Justice Department argues that Bolton’s job meant he “regularly came into possession of some of the most sensitive classified information that exists in the U.S. government.” Officials said Bolton’s manuscript was more than 500 pages and was “rife with classified information, which he proposed to release to the world.”The book contained “significant quantities of classified information that it asked Defendant to remove,” the filing says.“The United States is not seeking to censor any legitimate aspect of Defendant’s manuscript; it merely seeks an order requiring Defendant to complete the prepublication review process and to take all steps necessary to ensure that only a manuscript that has been officially authorized through that process — and is thus free of classified information — is disseminated publicly,” the lawsuit says.Bolton’s book, “The Room Where It Happened: A White House Memoir,” was supposed to be released in March. Its release date was twice delayed and it is now set to be released next week by Simon & Schuster.“Bolton covers an array of topics — chaos in the White House, sure, but also assessments of major players, the president’s inconsistent, scattershot decision-making process, and his dealings with allies and enemies alike, from China, Russia, Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, the United Kingdom, France, and Germany,” according to the publisher.“I am hard-pressed to identify any significant Trump decision during my tenure that wasn’t driven by reelection calculations,” Bolton writes in the book, according to a news release from the publisher.The book has been highly anticipated for months, especially after news broke during Trump’s impeachment trial that the manuscript offered a vivid account of the president’s efforts to withhold military aid from Ukraine in exchange for the country assisting with investigations into Trump’s political rival Joe Biden. Those allegations formed the crux of the impeachment case, which ended with the president’s Senate acquittal in February.Cooper did not immediately return an email seeking comment on the lawsuit. He has previously said that he sent Bolton’s manuscript to White House classification specialist Ellen Knight in late December and that Knight and Bolton spent nearly four months going through the nearly 500-page book multiple times, “often line by line.”According to the lawsuit, Knight completed her review in late April and determined that the manuscript did not contain classified information. But early the next month, Michael Ellis, a senior National Security Council official, began an additional review of the manuscript and found classified information in it, the lawsuit says. The review was still ongoing earlier this month when media reports revealed that Bolton intended to move forward with his book.In a statement Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union said the lawsuit is “doomed to fail.” Ben Wizner, the director of the organization’s speech, technology and privacy project, said the Supreme Court had rejected a half-century ago the Nixon administration’s efforts to block the release of the Pentagon Papers, and said it is well-established that prior restraints on publication are unconstitutional.“As usual, the government’s threats have nothing to do with safeguarding national security, and everything to do with avoiding scandal and embarrassment,” Wizner said.____Associated Press writers Michael Balsamo, Zeke Miller and Deb Riechmann contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-sues-to-delay-release-of-bolton-book/story-beirzocK22VCRLF09JT7QJ.html
17-06-2020||World||Singapore scientists discover 5 antibodies that can combat Covid-19||A team of Singapore scientists has discovered five antibodies that can block Covid-19 infection and protect against the key mutations that have emerged in the virus during the pandemic, the country’s defence research and development organisation said on Wednesday. Human trials for the lead antibody, AOD01, will commence in the coming months, pending approval from the Health Sciences Authority, said the Defense Science Organisation (DSO) National Laboratories. The DSO said that its scientists have screened “hundreds of thousands” of B cells - the cells that produce antibodies to target pathogens - from the blood samples of recovered Covid-19 patients since March this year. The scientists managed to isolate the first two antibodies for testing within a month of receiving the blood samples from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases and Singapore General Hospital. Two months later, it identified another three effective antibodies. This was done using a technique that screens B cells simultaneously with live virus, allowing antibodies with effective virus neutralising properties to be quickly identified, reported Channel News Asia. The technique was developed by the DSO in collaboration with the National University of Singapore’s Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine and Life Sciences Institute over the last five years, according to the report.Results showed that the five antibodies “demonstrate neutralisation” against Covid-19, said the DSO.“They are all potent in blocking infection and effective against key mutations that have emerged in the virus during the pandemic,” it said.With the research phase completed, the study is now transiting into the preclinical phase, where the team is preparing the lead antibody for production, said Dr Conrad Chan, principal research scientist and laboratory director (applied molecular technology). This will allow clinical trials to be conducted, and manufacturing to be scaled up when human trials are successful, he added. If the clinical trial “goes well”, the antibodies could stop the virus from spreading to the lungs if administered before the illness becomes too severe, he said in response to questions about how the antibodies could help patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-scientists-discover-5-antibodies-that-can-combat-covid-19/story-Z2MqwmXkXyNLrjyXfn100L.html
17-06-2020||World||5 years after church massacre, South Carolina protects monuments||Five years ago after eight black church members and their pastor were shot and killed in a racist attack, South Carolina came together and took down the Confederate flag from the Capitol lawn.Today, as yet another shocking killing of an African American roils the country, bringing a wave of pulled down statues and the removal of names of historical figures who repressed or oppressed other people, South Carolina leaders appears to be sitting out this movement so far.Wednesday marks five years since Dylann Roof sat through nearly an hour of Bible study at the Mother Emanuel AME church and then started shooting as the group prayed. Nine black worshippers were killed. Roof spared one woman’s life so she could tell everyone he wanted to start a race war. He was sentenced to death and remains in federal prison.Roof didn’t hesitate to explain his racist beliefs to FBI agents and left a handwritten journal full of his views, such as blacks being inferior to whites. He also left behind pictures of himself holding the gun used in the killings, posing at historic Civil War and African American sites and holding the Confederate flag.Outraged political leaders came together and overwhelmingly voted to take down a Confederate flag that flew near a monument to Confederate soldiers on the Statehouse lawn.That was the last time the General Assembly invoked a 2000 law called the Heritage Act. The law protects all historical monuments and names of buildings, requiring a two-thirds vote from the state General Assembly to make any changes.That’s a tough task in a state where conservative Republicans dominate the House and Senate, made harder after Republican House Speaker Jay Lucas said days after the Confederate flag came down in 2015 that he would never consider another change like it while he led the House.Lucas has kept his word, failing to respond to repeated interview requests and questions whether his stance has since changed.Pressure is mounting, however. Clemson University trustees voted last Friday to ask the General Assembly to let it change the name of Tillman Hall, a main building on campus named for “Pitchfork” Ben Tillman.Tillman gained prominence wguke supporting a white mob that killed four black men in 1876 after they surrendered to them. He later became South Carolina’s governor and a US senator, committed to destroying any rights blacks obtained after the Civil War.“We of the South have never recognized the right of the negro to govern white men, and we never will. We have never believed him to be equal to the white man, and we will not submit to his gratifying his lust on our wives and daughters without lynching him,” Tillman said in a 1900 congressional speech.The president of the University of South Carolina wants lawmakers to let the school remove the name of J Marion Sims from a women’s dorm. Sims is honoured as the father of modern gynaecology, but conducted experimental treatment on slaves without anaesthesia.Sims and Tillman also have statues on the Statehouse lawn. Some African American lawmakers want plaques added, explaining their racist views. Others, like Rep. Justin Bamberg, want Tillman and the others gone.“I don’t like seeing ‘Pitchfork’ Ben Tillman every dang day I go to the Statehouse,” the Democrat said. “He boldly and proudly supported lynching my people.” And in Charleston on Tuesday, the current pastor of Mother Emanuel stood with civil rights activists and politicians who called for the removal from a downtown park of a 100-foot-tall (30-metre) statue of former US Vice President John C Calhoun.Calhoun’s support of slavery never wavered. And in an 1836 speech before the US Senate, he said slaves in the South were better off than free blacks in the North.The Rev. Nelson Rivers said Calhoun “represents Dylann Roof to us” and said Charleston leaders should defy the unjust Heritage Act — which does not include penalties for breaking it — and remove the statue.“The time has come to not just acknowledge your racist evil wicked past. The time has come to take down the monuments that honour the evil that was done in the name of Charleston, in the name of South Carolina,” Rivers said Tuesday at the foot of Calhoun’s statue.Charleston Mayor John Tecklenburg said he will announce the city’s decision Wednesday on the statue’s future.The time has come for Republicans in South Carolina to either clear the way to remove monuments or show their true colours, said Rivers, who spent nearly 40 years with the NAACP and is now a vice president with the civil rights group National Action Network.“Either you support a monument to hate or you do not,” Rivers said. “There is nothing fuzzy about this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-years-after-church-massacre-south-carolina-protects-monuments/story-xbvdFB6zIaSKDUKZwZNXLJ.html

She added that an audit would be done to make sure all processes in place are followed and any changes needed can be made to further strengthen the border facilities.“I cannot allow the gains we have all made to be squandered by processes that are not followed,” Ardern said at a news conference in parliament.New Zealand had trumpeted its achievement last week of becoming one of the first countries in the world to eliminate Covid-19 and return to pre-pandemic normality, lifting all social and economic restrictions except border controls. The two women who arrived from Britain on June 7 went into compulsory quarantine after landing, but had been given special permission to leave the facility early to see their dying parent, even though one had symptoms which she attributed to a pre-existing condition. Ardern said the infected person should never have been allowed to leave.“This represents an unacceptable failure of the system,” Ardern said. “We require not one but two tests to be undertaken at those facilities. ..it did not, and there are no excuses,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-military-to-oversee-quarantine-facilities-after-new-covid-19-case/story-BU5OceHS83LHl7sMK4m5yM.html

For example he was shown meeting in person with the chief of oil giant Rosneft, Igor Sechin, on May 12. Despite these measures, some in Putin’s circle have caught the virus, including his spokesman Dmitry Peskov, who said, however, that he had not met the president recently enough to have infected him.In an apparent close brush with the virus in March, Putin was shown on television shaking hands with the chief doctor at a Moscow virus hospital while neither was wearing a mask. The doctor, Denis Protsenko, soon afterwards tested positive.The elaborate precautions protecting Putin sparked anger from some as the Kremlin has ruled it is safe to hold a national vote on July 1 on constitutional changes that would allow him to serve another consecutive Kremlin term.“Let them install this know-how at every polling station and then hold a vote,” wrote a commentator, Aleks, on the website of Komsomolskaya Pravda tabloid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-putin-has-disinfection-tunnel-to-protect-him-from-coronavirus/story-lgiCn2udOsZne9NLemhnvO.html
17-06-2020||World||Undeterred by tourism downturn, Beijing to launch new airlines focussed on ‘Hawaii of China’||Coronavirus pandemic may have severely hit the travel and aviation sector globally but that hasn’t shaken China’s resolve. According to Chinese media reports, the country is all set to launch new airlines. China Eastern Airlines, which is the country’s second-biggest airline, will soon launch a new carrier with a focus on the island destination of Hainan, often referred to as the ‘Hawaii of China’. The move comes at a time when the global airline industry is struggling to survive amid the Covid-19 crisis. The new carrier, called Sanya International Airlines, comes as a joint venture between government-backed China Eastern Airlines and other several regional players.

Carrillo also was charged with the attempted murder of a second guard injured in the Oakland attack, which unfolded blocks away from demonstrations and civil unrest over the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis days earlier.Carrillo’s suspected accomplice, Robert Alvin Justus Jr., 30, was charged with aiding and abetting the Oakland attack. He was arrested, according to an FBI affidavit filed in the case, after confessing to driving the van from which Carrillo opened fire on the two uniformed guards.Justus was not implicated in the events a week later that led to Carrillo’s arrest - a deadly ambush on California sheriff’s deputies, an ensuing gunbattle with police and a failed carjacking getaway attempt.Carrillo was charged last week in state court with one count of murder, eight counts of attempted murder, and various other offenses, including the making and detonating of pipe bombs. Court papers filed in the case linked both men with the far-right boogaloo ideology whose followers see the U.S. government as an enemy bent on confiscating the guns they need in the event of civil war, a violent uprising or collapse of society. The FBI affidavit said Carrillo appeared to have used his own blood to scrawl the word “BOOG” - shorthand for boogaloo - and the phrase “I became unreasonable” on the hood of a car he sought to hijack before he was apprehended near the central California town of Ben Lomond.A search of his vehicle, the same van tied to the Oakland shooting, turned up a ballistic vest with a boogaloo insignia patch, according to the FBI. Authorities also seized an assault rifle equipped with a silencer, a gun they said was used in both killings.The FBI said the two defendants met on Facebook and that Carrillo wrote in an online chat the night before the Oakland shooting that the street protests over Floyd’s death presented “a great opportunity” to stage an attack.The affidavit quoted Justus as replying: “let’s boogie,” which, according to the FBI, signified an “agreement and affirmation to engage in attacks on law enforcement personnel in accordance with boogaloo ideology.”Three other suspected followers of the boogaloo movement were arrested earlier this month by federal authorities and charged with planning to incite violence and destruction during protests in Las Vegas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-men-linked-to-boogaloo-movement-charged-in-us-courthouse-guard-killing/story-tV55srihaRLYSFvLHYPNnM.html

That sent Sinopharm shares up by as much as 15% in Hong Kong to be the best performer in the MSCI Asia Pacific Index.China National Medicines Corp., a unit of Sinopharm, soared by the 10% daily limit in Shanghai while another subsidiary China National Accord Medicines Corp. jumped as much as 8.8% in Shenzhen. The MSCI China healthcare gauge rose as much as 2.2% to the highest in two years.Using a killed version of the coronavirus, the vaccine developed by Sinopharm is among five Chinese experimental shots that have reached the crucial final stage of human testing before they can be approved for public use. Data collected from early phases of human testing in three of the five vaccines have suggested they are safe and able to elicit immune response to the virus in studies that enrolled hundreds of people.As the world races to develop a vaccine against the coronavirus, Beijing has mobilized its health authorities, drug regulators and research institutes to work around the clock with local firms. China has promised to share any successful vaccine globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sinopharm-jumps-most-in-5-years-on-covid-19-vaccine-results/story-PiTDWDxCdkSz7ShBHclN6I.html
17-06-2020||World||Turkey moves troops against Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq||Turkey said Wednesday it has airlifted troops for a cross-border ground operation against Turkey’s Kurdish rebels in northern Iraq, the first known airborne-and-land offensive by Ankara inside Iraqi territory.The airborne offensive into Iraq’s border region of Haftanin, some 15 kilometers (9 miles) from the Turkey-Iraq border, was launched following intense artillery fire into the area, said the Defense Ministry in Ankara.The operation by commando forces is being supported by warplanes, attack helicopters, artillery and armed and unarmed drones, according to the ministry’s statement posted on Twitter. It did not say how many troops are involved.The ministry said the operation follows “increasing harassment and attempts to attack” military outposts or bases inside Turkey, near the border area. It said the Turkish forces would target other “terror” groups in the region, but did not name them.“Operation Claw-Tiger is continuing successfully as planned,” the ministry said. It shared videos of Defense Minister Hulusi Akar overseeing the mission at a command center in Ankara.Turkey regularly carries out air and ground attacks against the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK, which it says maintains bases in northern Iraq. Wednesday’s was the first known airborne and land offensive.It came days after Turkey launched an air operation in the region, which the Defense Ministry said hit suspected PKK targets in several locations in Iraq’s north, including Sinjar, and targeted 81 rebel hideouts.“Turkey continues its fight against terrorists using the rights based on international law,” said Omer Celik, the deputy chairman of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s ruling party. “It is our most natural right and duty to fight terrorists who attack our borders, citizens, and security forces.”There was no immediate reaction from the PKK or from Baghdad and northern Iraq’s semi-autonomous Kurdish region.Iraq’s government however, summoned the Turkish ambassador on Tuesday to protest against the aerial offensive.The PKK has led a decades-long insurgency in Turkey’s mainly Kurdish southeast region. It is considered a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The conflict has led to the loss of tens of thousands lives since it started in 1984.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/turkey-moves-troops-against-kurdish-rebels-in-northern-iraq/story-GwiLtQ8armdjPagy30dQoL.html
17-06-2020||World||Hong Kong Chief Executive urges people not to ‘demonize’ security law||Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam said Tuesday that she hopes opponents of a new national security law being imposed by China do not “demonize and stigmatize” the legislation because doing so would mean pitting themselves against residents of the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.“The people of Hong Kong want to see stability again, they want a safe environment where they can work and live,” Lam told reporters.She said people were “sick and tired” of violence in Hong Kong and intervention by foreign forces in the city.China’s ceremonial parliament in May approved the decision to enact a national security law in Hong Kong, aimed at curbing subversive, secessionist, terrorist and foreign intervention activities in the city following months of anti-government protests last year.“We are part of the People’s Republic of China, but we don’t have a mechanism to protect national security,” Lam said. “This is a risk not just to over 7 million people in Hong Kong, it’s also a risk to 1.4 billion people in the country.” Lam spoke ahead of a meeting this week by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, which exercises legislative power in China. The law is not on the meeting’s agenda, but Hong Kong delegate Tam Yiu Chung said in an interview Monday that items could be added.Critics consider the imminent legislation an attack on the “one country, two systems” framework in which China promised Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy and freedoms not found on the mainland when the former British colony was returned to Chinese control in 1997. They fear that the law will be used to curb any dissent in Hong Kong.Details about the law have not been disclosed, though Lam said the specifics will be established. She said people “don’t need to worry” about this because at the end of the day, it is for Hong Kong’s authorities to enforce the law.” “Please accept and understand why we have to do it,” she said. “The only purpose of this task is to protect Hong Kong and the country.” The anti-government protests had subsiding during coronavirus restrictions, but have returned to the city in recent weeks, even though social distancing measures remain in place.Lam said Hong Kong will relax its measures gradually.“It would be risky if we completely lift the measures,” she said. “In recent times in some cities such as Beijing, we have seen imported cases and some countries have seen an influx of cases after relaxing measures.” Hong Kong’s secretary for food and health, Sophia Chan, said Tuesday that the ban on public gatherings will be relaxed from eight to 50 people.Restaurants will no longer be limited by capacity. For establishments such as bars and karaoke lounges, the maximum number of guests per table will be doubled from eight to 16.“The relaxation is made in light of the easing of the epidemic. We also realize that certain activities must resume,” said Chan, who stressed that there was “no political consideration” involved in limiting the number of people allowed in public gatherings. Separately, a group of over 50 protesters gathered in a shopping mall in the city’s Causeway Bay shopping district despite heavy riot police presence, shouting slogans and holding up flags that said “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of our times.” Police stopped and searched several people near Victoria Park, where protests were initially supposed to take place but were later cancelled. They did not appear to make any arrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-chief-executive-urges-people-not-to-demonize-security-law/story-2mlxplrTncSJkkYxpGhR5H.html
17-06-2020||World||Group of 86 NGOs issue letter calling for scrapping of planned Hong Kong security law||A group of 86 non-government organisations issued a joint letter on Wednesday asking Chinese authorities to scrap plans to introduce national security legislation in Hong Kong, saying it threatens basic rights and freedoms.The letter, signed by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and Freedom House, among others, was addressed to Li Zhanshu, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, China’s top legislative body.Beijing last month announced a plan to introduce legislation in Hong Kong to tackle secession, subversion, terrorism and foreign interference. The law could see Chinese security agencies set up bases in the city for the first time.Critics, including diplomats, lawyers and business executives, see the law as a threat to a “one country, two systems” formula, agreed when the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 to protect its freedoms and role as a global financial centre.Hong Kong and Beijing officials say the planned law in fact strengthens the governance formula and would only target a small number of “troublemakers” threatening national security, while leaving rights and freedoms intact.They have dismissed criticism from foreign governments and organisations, urging them to stop interfering in China’s internal affairs.Key details of the legislation, expected to be implemented by September, remain unknown.“Although no details of the law’s contents have been made publicly available, the decision – along with recent comments by Chinese and Hong Kong officials – suggest that it will threaten the basic rights and freedoms of the people in Hong Kong,” the letter said.“We are particularly concerned about the law’s impact on Hong Kong, especially its vibrant civil society.”Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Tuesday urged opponents of Beijing’s national security legislation plans to stop “smearing” the effort, saying those who did were “the enemy of the people”.The signatories of the letter included rights groups from the United States, Australia, Canada, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Europe.

Earlier this month, Cook wrote in a letter to employees and customers that society needs to do more to push equality, particularly for Black people.“To create change, we have to reexamine our own views and actions in light of a pain that is deeply felt but too often ignored. Issues of human dignity will not abide standing on the sidelines,” Cook wrote in the letter.Smith joined Apple in 2017 after 16 years at consultancy Deloitte. Unlike her predecessor, who reported directly to the CEO, Smith reported to Apple’s Senior Vice President of Retail and People Deirdre O’Brien.“Inclusion and diversity are core Apple values and we deeply believe the most diverse teams are the most innovative teams,” Apple said in an emailed statement confirming the news. “Christie Smith will be leaving Apple to spend more time with her family and we wish her well. Our Inclusion and Diversity team continues to report directly to Deirdre O’Brien on the Executive Team.”Apple said the move was planned two months ago, though a person familiar with the matter said Smith’s last day was Tuesday.The Cupertino, California-based company has made little progress in increasing the diversity among its overall workforce since it began releasing data in 2014. According to its 2018 diversity report, 67% of global employees were male, down from 70% in 2014. In the US, 6% of tech employees were Black in 2018, unchanged from 2014.Apple hasn’t disclosed its most recent diversity numbers yet, but the company has made some headway in recent years increasing diversity among new hires. More than half of new hires in the US in 2018 were Black, Hispanic or from other historically underrepresented groups in tech. Women accounted for 38% of Apple’s workforce under the age of 30, compared to 33% of the its overall staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-s-diversity-chief-christie-smith-leaves-as-companies-vow-to-tackle-racism/story-RuMviujmQPsgW4XEtOOpLP.html

The state of normalcy in a post-Covid-19 world will be an altered version of what “normal” once looked like. One of the major sectors to have taken the hit of the pandemic is the aviation industry. As it struggles to get back to the open skies, many challenges loom ahead. The future of flying, at least in the immediate days to come, is going to change. One of the major changes brought about by some airlines is temporarily stopping the sale of alcoholic beverages inside the aircraft to make flying amid Covid-19 crisis a safe experience. According to a CNN report, a host of airlines companies including American carriers like Delta, American, have decided not to serve alcoholic drinks to flyers in a bid to reduce food and drink options aboard. US’ Delta Airlines will only be serving alcohol in its international flights. Many airlines, including British budget airline EasyJet, have settled with only serving bottled water aboard. The Netherlands flag-carrier KLM, has suspended sales of hot and alcoholic drinks, but for water and soft drinks. Also read: People with co-morbidities 12 times more likely to die of Covid - US studyThe UK’s flag carrier, British Airways, has suspended its alcoholic beverages in its short-haul economy class flights (”Euro Traveller”). Virgin Australia is serving water and a snack to all its flyers, however, additional food and drinks - including alcoholic beverages - aren’t currently available for onboard. India resumed domestic air travel last month with a strict ban on international flight operations in place. As per the guidelines issued by the Ministry of Civil Aviation, “no newspaper or magazine shall be provided on board by the airlines to the passengers”. Sale of eatables is barred and passengers are not allowed to consume food inside the aircraft.The ministry issued a detailed “inside the aircraft” guidelines to inform about the measures to be followed inside the aircraft and restricted consumption of eatables, barring water, inside the flight. In the Aircrafta. Throughout the flight, hygiene and sanitation to be maintained by the passengers. Face to face interaction to be minimized.b. Passenger are advised to minimize use of lavatory and to avoid any non-essential movement in the aisles.c. No queuing at the lavatory and only one companion for children and the elderly to be allowed.d. No meal services would be made available in the aircraft.

Passengers to note that No paper/magazine will be available in the aircraft.g. There would be no on-board sale of any item to minimize the physical contacts.h. lf any passenger feels uncomfortable, fatigued or have cough, it should be brought to the notice of the crew for handling the passenger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/flying-amid-covid-19-pandemic-airlines-across-globe-are-stopping-in-flight-alcohol-sales/story-ZxULXpUtOnJJA3i6h7iiSP.html
17-06-2020||World||Facebook aims to help voters, but won’t block Trump misinfo||Facebook is launching a widespread effort to boost US voter turnout and provide authoritative information about voting — just as it doubles down on its policy allowing politicians like President Donald Trump to post false information on the same subject.The social media giant is launching a “Voting Information Center” on Facebook and Instagram that will include details on registering to vote, polling places and voting by mail. It will draw the information from state election officials and local election authorities.The information hub, which will be prominently displayed on Facebook news feeds and on Instagram later in the summer — is similar to the coronavirus information center the company launched earlier this year in an attempt to elevate facts and authoritative sources of information on Covid-19.Facebook and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, continue to face criticism for not removing or labeling posts by Trump that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, many said, encouraged violence against protesters.“I know many people are upset that we’ve left the President’s posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,” Zuckerberg wrote earlier this month.In a USA Today opinion piece Tuesday, Zuckerberg reaffirmed that position.“Ultimately, I believe the best way to hold politicians accountable is through voting, and I believe we should trust voters to make judgments for themselves,” he wrote. “That’s why I think we should maintain as open a platform as possible, accompanied by ambitious efforts to boost voter participation.”Facebook’s free speech stance may have more to do with not wanting to alienate Trump and his supporters while keeping its business options open, critics suggest.Dipayan Ghosh, co-director of the Platform Accountability Project at Harvard Kennedy School, said Facebook “doesn’t want to tick off a whole swath of people who really believe the president and appreciate” his words.In addition to the voting hub, Facebook will also now let people turn off political and social issue ads that display the “paid for by” designation, meaning a politician or political entity paid for it. The company announced this option in January but it is going into effect now.Sarah Schiff, product manager who works on ads, cautioned that Facebook’s systems “aren’t perfect” and said she encourages users to report “paid for by” ads they see if they have chosen not to see them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-aims-to-help-voters-but-won-t-block-trump-misinfo/story-fB27jOJUAE5nrTqiSuqThK.html

Beijing had essentially eradicated local transmissions but in recent days has added a total of 137 new cases with no new deaths.On Wednesday, the city raised its threat level from 3 to 2, leading to the cancellation of classes, suspension of plans for opening up and stiffened requirements for social distancing.No official public notice on a change in regulations has been issued by China’s civil aviation authority or by either Beijing Capital Airport — traditionally the world’s second busiest handling more than 101 million passengers — or Beijing Daxing International Airport.However, on its official microblog, Beijing Capital said it expected to handle 500 flights on Wednesday. According to the official Beijing Daily website, the number of takeoffs and landings at the airport on June 10 was 901.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/report-60-of-beijing-flights-canceled-to-stem-virus-spread/story-3bToc8unAB1VMstucVenwJ.html

He also contacted the leaders of Mexico, Spain, Ethiopia, Angola, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan.While India is almost assured of being elected, Canada faces a stiff challenge from Ireland and Norway, as the three countries compete for two seats from the Western European and Others group. This may have been a last gasp effort by Trudeau to secure India’s backing even though New Delhi appears to be going by the reciprocal arrangement already arrived at with Ireland and Norway even before Canada entered the fray.Impact of the Covid-19 pandemic was part of the conversation, as Trudeau “highlighted the need for continued international coordination, including through multilateral institutions, to fight the pandemic and promote sustainable economic growth.” The Indian statement said the leaders agreed that the two nations could be “a force for good in the post-Covid world.”PM Modi “warmly appreciated” the assistance provided by Canada in facilitating the repatriation of Indians stranded in the country, while Trudeau reciprocated as New Delhi helped in the process of brining Canadians back home from India.They also “agreed that as large economies wedded to democratic values, India and Canada have a natural convergence on many global issues” and “looked forward to continuing to work together to strengthen the dynamic and mutually beneficial Canada-India relationship.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-prime-minister-justin-trudeau-calls-pm-modi-discusses-covid-19-pandemic-and-situation-at-lac/story-FUetGAxFgAM2HD3ubKcM8L.html
17-06-2020||World||UAE can work with Israel, despite political differences, says minister||The United Arab Emirates can work with Israel on some areas, including fighting the new coronavirus and on technology, while still having political differences with the state, a senior official said on Tuesday.Addressing a conference of the American Jewish Committee (AJC) advocacy group, minister of state for foreign affairs Anwar Gargash said communication with Israel was important and would yield better results than other routes taken in the past.His question and answer session, described as “historic” by the AJC, occurred days after another senior official made a rare appeal to the Israeli public by having an article published in Hebrew in Israel’s leading newspaper. The official said Israel cannot expect to normalise relations with the Arab world if it annexes land in the occupied West Bank. “Can I have a political disagreement with Israel but at the same time try and bridge other areas of the relationship? I think I can and I think this is fundamentally where we are,” said Gargash, who has previously said the Arab decision not to have contact with Israel was wrong.He added that cooperation on the challenge posed by the Covid-19 pandemic does not affect the UAE’s opposition to the proposed annexation or other political issues.Israel has no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries, but common concerns over Iran’s regional influence have led to a limited thaw in ties. In May, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad made the first known flight by a UAE carrier to Israel, carrying coronavirus-related aid for the Palestinians.Egypt and Jordan are the only Arab states that have peace deals with Israel. The Israeli government intends to begin debating on July 1 the annexation plan, which would apply Israeli sovereignty to Jewish settlements and the Jordan Valley in the West Bank.In the newspaper article, the UAE’s ambassador to Washington said annexation would upend Israeli aspirations for improved security, economic and cultural ties with the Arab world and the UAE.The Jewish community in the UAE has recently taken on a more public profile. A new kosher food delivery service was covered in national newspapers, and a group called the Jewish Community of the UAE opened a Twitter account in late May.The group released a video, shared on Twitter by the UAE ambassador to London, featuring a Hebrew prayer for the UAE leadership.“We want to see a region that is more stable. A region that can resolve its issues over a negotiating table,” Gargash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-can-work-with-israel-despite-political-differences-says-minister/story-FPieAetMFtRHN0If8r8x0K.html
17-06-2020||World||CIA failed to protect agency’s top-secret hacking tools, leading to historic data loss: Report||A specialized CIA unit that developed sophisticated hacking tools and cyber weapons didn’t do enough to protect its own operations and wasn’t prepared to adequately respond when the secrets were stolen, according to an internal report prepared after the worst data loss in the intelligence agency’s history.“These shortcomings were emblematic of a culture that evolved over years that too often prioritized creativity and collaboration at the expense of security,” according to the report, which raises questions about cybersecurity practices inside US intelligence agencies.Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., a senior member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, obtained the redacted report from the Justice Department after it was introduced as evidence in a court case this year involving the stolen CIA hacking tools.He released it on Tuesday along with a letter he wrote to new national intelligence director John Ratcliffe, asking him to explain what steps he’s taking to protect the nation’s secrets held by federal intelligence agencies.The October 2017 report, whose findings were first reported by The Washington Post, examined the theft one year earlier of sensitive cyber tools the CIA had developed to hack into the networks of adversaries.The document is dated months after WikiLeaks announced that it had acquired tools created by the CIA’s specialized Center for Cyber Intelligence. The anti-secrecy website published comprehensive descriptions of 35 tools, including internal CIA documents associated with them, according to the report.The report describes the spring 2016 theft as the largest data loss in agency history — compromising at least 180 gigabytes to as much as 34 terabytes of information, or the equivalent of 11.6 million to 2.2 billion pages in Microsoft Word.The agency did not realize the loss had occurred until the WikiLeaks announcement a year later, the report said. As officials scrambled to pinpoint who was responsible, they ultimately identified as a prime suspect a CIA software engineer who they said had left the agency on stormy terms after falling out with colleagues and supervisors and had acted out of revenge.The former employee, Joshua Schulte, was charged by the Justice Department with stealing the material and transmitting it to WikiLeaks. But a jury deadlocked on those charges and convicted him in March of more minor charges after a trial in Manhattan.The CIA report revealed lax cybersecurity measures by the specialized unit and the niche information technology systems that it relies upon, which is separate from the systems more broadly used by everyday agency employees. The report says that because the stolen data was on a system that lacked user activity monitoring, it was not detected until WikiLeaks announced it in March 2017.“Had the data been stolen for the benefit of a state adversary and not published, we might still be unaware of the loss” the report says.The report, prepared by the CIA’s WikiLeaks Task Force, suggests the CIA should have been better prepared in light of devastating data breaches at other intelligence agencies. The hacking tools compromise occurred about three years after Edward Snowden, a former contractor for the National Security Agency, confiscated classified information about the NSA’s surveillance operations, and disclosed it.“CIA has moved too slowly to put in place the safeguards that we knew were necessary given successive breaches to other US Government agencies,” the report said.Among the problems the report identified: sensitive cyber weapons were not compartmented, passwords were shared and users had indefinite access to historical data.CIA spokesman Timothy Barrett declined to comment on the report’s findings, but said the “CIA works to incorporate best-in-class technologies to keep ahead of and defend against ever-evolving threats.”Sean Roche, a former associate deputy director for digital innovation at the CIA who testified at the Schulte trial, said that although the CIA did have a problem with one of its networks, “to say that the people at the CIA don’t take security seriously is not accurate. It’s completely inaccurate.”Speaking Tuesday at a webinar hosted by the Cipher Brief, an online newsletter that focuses on intelligence, Roche likened the task force report to an after-accident report by the National Transportation Safety Board.“This broke. This is what happened,” Roche said. “We need to make sure this doesn’t happen again. How is that not a healthy thing for an organization that doesn’t have a public eye into what it’s doing?”The disclosure of the hacking tools featured prominently in Shulte’s trial, with prosecutors portraying him as a disgruntled software engineer who exploited a little-known back-door in a CIA network to copy the hacking arsenal without raising suspicion.“These leaks were devastating to national security,” Assistant US Attorney Matthew Laroche told jurors. “The CIA’s cyber tools were gone in an instant.

17-06-2020||World||Beijing reports 31 new Covid-19 cases, tally climbs to 137 in 6 days||Beijing on Wednesday reported 31 new cases of Covid-19 for June 16, four more than the day before, taking the total number of cases to 137 in six days as city authorities race to contain the fresh cluster of infection with renewed restrictions on travel and public gatherings.Following the rise in cases, two airports in Beijing have cancelled 1,255 flights, nearly 70 % of all scheduled trips, for June 17, according to state media.Overall, 44 confirmed cases, including 11 imported cases (10 in Gansu and 1 in Sichuan) and 33 local cases -- 31 cases in Beijing, one case in the neighbouring province of Hebei and one more case in eastern China’s Zhejiang province -- were reported from mainland China in the past 24 hours, the national health commission (NHC) said in its daily bulletin on Wednesday morning.Late on Tuesday night, the city government had upped the emergency response level back to the second level from the third, barely two weeks after it had lowered it to the least after the capital reported no new case for almost two months.The late-night announcement on Tuesday shut down all schools, banned residents from middle and high-risk areas from leaving the city, and suspended all outdoor sports and entertainment activities.Those who must travel out of Beijing, as per the directive, need to present a negative nucleic acid test result conducted within seven days of departure.The new cluster, linked to the Xinfadi wholesale food market in the southwest Fengtai district, has spread to nine of the city’s 16 districts and at least 29 localities and streets.Local officials had already locked down dozens of residential compounds close to the Xinfadi and three other fresh food markets and had ordered more than 30000 restaurants to be disinfected.Chen Yankai, a deputy director of the Beijing market supervision bureau, was quoted by state media as saying that Beijing has disinfected 276 farm produce markets and closed 11 such underground and semi-underground markets as of 6 Tuesday morning.About 200,000 people who had visited the Xinfadi market since May 30 were interviewed via door-to-door inquiries, calls, social media platforms and other methods.State media reported that over 46 percent of 833 flights inbound and outbound flights from Beijing’s airports were cancelled because of the new outbreak.The “…epidemic situation in Beijing remains grim”, as the city has been reporting a daily double-digit growth in domestically transmitted Covid-19 cases since June 11, Chen Bei, deputy secretary-general of the Beijing municipal government, said Tuesday.The cluster outbreak is believed to be caused by human-to-human transmission or contamination of articles and environment, Chen said.According to the official news agency, Xinhua, she stressed that there had been confirmed secondary infections among close contacts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-reports-31-new-covid-19-cases-tally-climbs-to-137-in-6-days/story-pU767eqbxl9rEjDwrmdtPL.html
17-06-2020||World||North Korea’s military to re-enter inter-Korea cooperation sites||North Korea said Wednesday it will redeploy troops to now-shuttered inter-Korean cooperation sites, reinstall guard posts and resume military exercises at front-line areas, nullifying the landmark reconciliation deals reached with South Korea just two years ago.The announcement came a day after North Korea destroyed an inter-Korean liaison office in a choreographed display of anger that puts pressure on Washington and Seoul amid deadlocked nuclear diplomacy. The demolition was the most provocative act by North Korea since it entered nuclear talks in 2018, though the building in its border town of Kaesong was empty and the North had previously signaled plans to destroy it.The North’s General Staff said regiment-level units and units supporting them with armed reinforcement will be deployed to the Diamond Mountain resort and the Kaesong industrial complex, both just north of the heavily fortified border. Those sites, once symbols of inter-Korean cooperation, have been shuttered for years due to the economic sanctions imposed on North Korea because of its nuclear program.Also read | Kim Yo Jong: North Korean leader’s increasingly powerful sisterThe North said it will also resume military exercises and reestablish guard posts in border areas and open front-line sites for flying propaganda balloons toward South Korea. These steps would nullify 2018 agreements reached during inter-Korean diplomacy that were aimed at lowering military tensions at border areas.Under those agreements, both Koreas halted live-firing exercises, removed some land mines and destroyed guard posts inside their border, the world’s most heavily fortified. Some outside experts have said these moves undermined South Korea’s security more as the North’s nuclear weapons arsenal remain intact.South Korea’s government didn’t immediately respond to the North Korean military statement. Seoul’s Defense Ministry had said Tuesday it would strongly deal with future provocation by North Korea.Some outside analysts predicted North Korea would resort to provocation to wrest outside concessions because its economy has likely worsened under the persistent US-led sanctions and the coronavirus pandemic. North Korea may also be frustrated because the sanctions prevent Seoul from breaking away from Washington to resume joint economic projects with US.The North’s official Korean Central News Agency on Wednesday said the hard-line steps were taken to retaliate for South Korea’s failure to prevent activists from floating propaganda leaflets across the border.Also read | South Korea vows to respond sternly if North keeps raising tensionsThe building destruction was a “reflection of the zeal of our enraged people to punish human scum who challenged the noblest dignity and prestige of our country and those who sheltered the scum, perpetrators of shuddering crime.”It said the destruction was the first step in the retaliation and North Korea will set the intensity and timing for its additional steps while closely monitoring South Korean moves. “Under such an acute situation as now, shameless and reckless attitude and response of the South Korean authorities will lead to our tougher retaliation plans,” it said.Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, issued a separate statement saying North Korea had rebuffed a recent offer by South Korean President Moon Jae-in to send special envoys to Pyongyang to defuse animosities.She said Moon had offered to dispatch his National Security Director Chung Eui-yong and spy chief Suh Hun at the earliest possible date that North Korea would want. Moon’s office didn’t immediately confirm the North’s report.Kim Yo Jong, who has spearheaded the North’s recent fiery rhetoric against South Korea, called Moon’s offer “unrealistic” and “nonsensical.”“The (South Korean) chief executive greatly favors sending special envoys for ‘tiding over crises’ and raises preposterous proposals frequently, but he has to clearly understand that such a trick will no longer work on us,” Kim Yo Jong said. She said the current Korean crisis “can be terminated only when proper price is paid” for South Korea.Chung and Suh shuttled between Pyongyang and Washington in 2018 and helped to set up Kim Jong Un’s first summit with President Donald Trump in June that year in Singapore.The liaison office building was opened in 2018 when Korean ties flourished.South Korea on Tuesday expressed “strong regret” over the destruction of the liaison office the two Koreas had opened in 2018 when ties flourished. The statement also warned of a stern response if North Korea takes additional steps that aggravate tensions.North Korea’s moves have been a serious setback to Moon’s efforts at engagement. Moon champions greater reconciliation with North Korea, met Kim Jong Un three times and was a driving force behind the diplomacy between Pyongyang and Washington.Inter-Korean relations have been strained since the second summit between Kim Jong Un and Trump in early 2019 fell apart because of disputes over how much sanctions relief the North should get in return for dismantling its main nuclear complex, which was seen as a limited denuclearization measure.Moon and Kim, after the first of their three 2018 summits, agreed to stop all forms of hostile acts against each other, including leafleting campaigns. But the agreement doesn’t clearly say civilian leafleting should also be banned.Jang Kum Chol, director of the inter-Korean affairs department at North Korea’s ruling party, said Wednesday that Seoul is responsible for the building’s destruction because activists and North Korean defectors in South Korea continued launching leaflets.“Therefore, there can be no exchange or exchange with (the South’s) government. No words will be exchanged at all,” Jang said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-s-military-to-re-enter-inter-korea-cooperation-sites/story-D5VbIOo4p2lhbggi9kzT0J.html
17-06-2020||World||Some Amazon villagers eschew drugs for Covid-19, take ‘toothache plant’ herbal tea||Some villagers in the eastern Amazon are spurning Brazilian government advice to take the malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to keep the novel coronavirus at bay and are drinking tea of jambú, also known as the toothache plant.Maria de Nazaré Sajes, 65, tested positive for the coronavirus and believes she fought off the symptoms by drinking the infusion of bitter leaves.“I made jambú tea and felt healthy again. People said: ‘Look at Maria, how she has recovered, she no fever or pains’,” Maria said boiling water on a gas stove in her wooden house.Her village on the banks of a tributary of the Amazon was visited by public health workers to test inhabitants for the virus that is ravaging Brazil in the world’s second worst outbreak after the United States.US regulators withdrew approval this week for the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine to treat patients with Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. It is still being prescribed in Brazil as scientists around the world are working to develop a vaccine and effective treatments.In remote corners of the Amazon rainforest, where access to intensive care wards can require long boat rides to the nearest cities, prevention is paramount, and people there place their faith in traditional herbal medicines.Nurse Marilia Costa says there is resistance to taking hydroxychloroquine.“We are seeing that most inhabitants here are taking home-made remedies that they believe have great curing qualities,” she said. “They accept pills for fever, but they take it with their own local medicine.”Jambú leaves are used in local dishes, but said to work as an anesthetic that helps relieve pain, besides other properties fighting viruses and use as a laxative or aphrodisiac.“I’m afraid to go to hospital because there would be no natural medicine that we find here,” said a young woman called Maria Claudia. “They wouldn’t allow me to have jambú tea there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-amazon-villagers-eschew-drugs-for-covid-19-take-toothache-plant-herbal-tea/story-xBmfxlZwSjMSbxVErr3CPM.html
17-06-2020||World||Coronavirus leaves more Americans dead than World War I||With 740 new coronavirus deaths in 24 hours, the United States has seen more people die from the pandemic than died in World War I, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. The new figure, counted at 8:30 pm (0030 GMT) Tuesday, brought the country’s total Covid-19 deaths up to 116,854, the tracker from the Baltimore-based university showed. The increase came after two days of death tolls under 400. And 23,351 new cases in the same 24-hour period brought the total US count up to 2,134,973, making it by far the hardest-hit of any country in the world. The country’s pandemic death toll had already passed that of its soldiers in the Vietnam War in late April. The United States, where many businesses are reopening, continues to register around 20,000 new cases of the novel coronavirus each day. Several states are even recording their highest levels of new cases since the start of the pandemic.The administration of President Donald Trump, who has downplayed risks of the virus and instead focused on reviving the economy as he faces a tough re-election battle in November, insists there will be no shutdown of the economy if a second full-blown wave of the epidemic arises.Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell meanwhile warned that the US economy is unlikely to recover as long as “significant uncertainty” remains over the course of the pandemic.Trump has come under scrutiny for an upcoming campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma -- his first since March when the pandemic halted mass gatherings. It is so far planned for an indoor arena that holds about 20,000 people. The United States also agreed to keep its borders with Mexico and Canada closed until July 21, officials said Tuesday, extending travel restrictions for a third time due to the pandemic.la-caw/ch||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-leaves-more-americans-dead-than-world-war-i/story-rOiD42MIVuDjoc7pRbveVI.html
17-06-2020||World||Kim Jong Un may have more targets after blowing up Korea liaison office||North Korea’s move to destroy a liaison office with South Korea follows weeks of escalating rhetoric from the reclusive nation and may signal the start of fresh provocations against a country with which it shares one of the world’s most militarized borders.Kim Jong Un’s regime will probably stick for now to measures that are less likely to draw in the US military, with its 28,000 troops in South Korea and far superior firepower, to the Soviet-era weaponry in North Korea’s arsenal. Kim would also be calculating how to avoid raising the ire of China, which is North Korea’s main geopolitical and economic benefactor.That still leaves Pyongyang with an array of options to pressure South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has called for months for talks and sought economic exchanges but hasn’t broken away from the global sanctions regime choking North Korea’s crippled economy. Kim is the first North Korean leader to have direct talks with a sitting US president and now views Moon as meddlesome for attempting to act as a bridge to Donald Trump.So far the South Korean president has shown almost no appetite for retaliating against the regime at the risk of derailing a pledge he made to his supporters to bring the Koreas closer together. That’s even as trade between the countries, which was once about 10% of the size of North Korea’s economy, has shrunk to virtually zero due to the global sanctions pushing Pyongyang for nuclear and missile tests conducted in 2017.Here are some actions that might come next:More DestructionKim threatened in October to tear down South Korean-built structures at a North Korean mountain resort, saying they looked like “makeshift tents in a disaster-stricken area.” The Mount Kumgang resort, built by an affiliate of South Korea’s Hyundai Group and shuttered for more than a decade, opened in 1998 as a symbol of cooperation between two countries technically still at war. It has hotels, restaurants, shopping arcades and a performance hall. Moon has been pushing for it to reopen. Hyundai Asan Corp. said it has invested 767 billion won ($653 million) in total. In 2008, South Koreans were ordered to vacate the resort after a 53-year-old female vacationer who wandered off its grounds was shot dead by a North Korean soldier.Troop MovementsJust hours before North Korea blew up the liaison office, it said it was reviewing a plan to send troops into some areas of the Demilitarized Zone that divides the peninsula. On Wednesday, it made clear its intentions by saying it would deploy troops into disarmed areas on its side of the border where it had joint projects with South Korea. These are an area in the western border city of Kaesong where it had a joint factory park and the liaison office and Mount Kumgang on the east, where there was a joint resort. Troops were moved out to make way for those projects. It could also try to sully a 2018 agreement Moon reached with Kim to reduce tensions on the border by reopening 10 front-line guard posts.Olympic DreamsAfter marching together under a joint flag when South Korea hosted the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, prospects seem dim for a similar procession when Tokyo is set to host the summer games next year. The two told the International Olympic Committee in 2019 they were looking into a joint march and fielding a few unified teams. But after North Korea cut communications with South Korea this week in anger over anti-Pyongyang leaflets flying over the border, it’s almost impossible to iron out such details.Missile DeploymentSince 2019, North Korea has tested several types of short-range ballistic missiles capable of hitting all parts of South Korea, including US military bases. These solid-fuel missiles are among the new weapons rolled out under Kim and are easier to hide and deploy than his older rockets. The arsenal includes the nuclear-capable KN-23 that’s designed to avoid US interceptors on the peninsula. Kim could speed up his short-range weapons program to pressure Seoul, even as he holds fire on launching longer-range missiles.Armed ConflictThis is the highest-risk option but one North Korea has taken before, most notably a decade ago when it was suspected of torpedoing a South Korean warship, killing 46 sailors, and a few months later shelling a South Korean island, killing two soldiers and two civilians. An attack that goes too far runs the chance of spinning into war. An attack that leads to South Korean deaths undermines the calls for rapprochement on the grounds of brotherly unity made by many in Moon’s progressive camp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-may-have-more-targets-after-blowing-up-korea-liaison-office/story-Ba6Zuo1tbCbzTDLw1kt3fO.html

Regional authorities confirmed on Tuesday a statement from law enforcement over the weekend saying any claimant has five years to report “justified claims” of ownership.The incident is eye-popping even for a wealthy Alpine country with a high cost, and standard of living.In a similar incident three years ago, authorities in Geneva turned up wads of cut-up 500-euro notes (about $600 at the time) that were mysteriously jammed into the toilets of three restaurants and a bank in separate episodes. The shredded notes were once worth tens of thousands of euros in total.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/190k-in-gold-bars-unclaimed-from-swiss-train/story-vQAYnCvRxr8ISSqQe98ZFM.html
17-06-2020||World||Boris Johnson’s pledge to UK pensioners could be at risk after Covid-19||One of Boris Johnson’s most politically sensitive election pledges could be at risk in the wake of the economic fallout of the coronavirus.Government officials are aware that the pensions “triple lock,” promised by the last three Conservative prime ministers, may have to be reviewed if it becomes unaffordable, a person familiar with the matter said.A Treasury official denied that any decision had been taken, and rejected suggestions that Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak was preparing to drop the promise.But the virus has left a question mark over the guarantee to raise the state pension every year by the annual growth in average earnings, inflation, or 2.5% -- whichever is highest.That stems from the effect, first highlighted a week ago, that furloughing millions of workers and then returning them to work is expected to have on earnings. Some economists predict a drop this year followed by a rapid increase in 2021. That would mean the state pension, which already costs the government about 100 billion pounds ($126 billion) a year, having to rise substantially.The pensions rise in question isn’t due until April 2022, so ministers have some time before they have to decide. Much also depends on how the figures turn out. The Bank of England’s illustrative scenario for earnings sees them fall 2% in 2020 and then rise 4% in 2021, an increase that isn’t far off the minimum required under the triple lock.The Treasury said in a statement: “Announcements on tax and pension policy are for budgets. The government is committed to supporting pensioners.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-pledge-to-uk-pensioners-could-be-at-risk-after-covid-19/story-ZeWX3D0iYF80oiVbWuxrwM.html
17-06-2020||World||US expects insurers to cover Covid-19 vaccine without copays||US officials have said they expect health insurance companies will cover vaccines for Covid-19 without charging copays, once those vaccines are developed and become available.At a briefing for reporters, a senior Trump administration official said on Tuesday the government has been talking with insurers about offering vaccines at no cost to patients. The industry earlier made a similar commitment to cover testing for the coronavirus without charging copays.The White House has launched an initiative to quickly manufacture millions of doses of Covid-19 vaccines, once the Food and Drug Administration approves one or more formulations.Candidate vaccines are in early trials, and the goal — considered ambitious — is to have 300 million doses by early next year. At the White House signing of an executive order on policing, President Donald Trump predicted it could even be met before the end of this year. Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health has said a vaccine by year’s end is conceivable only if everything goes right in final testing this summer.Earlier Tuesday, senior administration officials provided an overview of the effort to rapidly manufacture, distribute and deliver eventual vaccines. The officials spoke on condition that they not be publicly identified.The White House has dubbed the initiative “Operation Warp Speed,” a joint project of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Pentagon, under the overall direction of HHS. The Defense Department has extensive medical capabilities to keep US service members worldwide safe from disease.As with other vaccines, US insurers will have a strong financial interest in covering one for Covid-19. Vaccines are seen as a win-win, helping the insurers’ customers stay healthy by preventing disease, which in turn can save the companies money. Administration officials told reporters on Tuesday that the Covid-19 vaccine, once available, will be distributed according to priorities, with the most vulnerable people ahead in line. The coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on older people and those with other underlying conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes. Not all Americans will have to be vaccinated, because it’s expected that millions will be protected by their own antibodies.Health insurers cover vaccines recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices. They’re considered a preventive service, and the Affordable Care Act requires insurers cover them at no charge to patients. A range of screening tests, immunizations and birth control for women are already covered under the Obama-era Affordable Care Act. However, the Trump administration is pressing the courts to overturn “Obamacare” as unconstitutional.At the White House, Trump exuded optimism, not dwelling on potential complications, whether legal or scientific.“I predict we will have a very successful vaccine, therapeutic, and cure,” said the president. “We’re making tremendous progress. I deal with these incredible scientists, doctors, very, very closely. I have great respect for their minds.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expects-insurers-to-cover-covid-19-vaccine-without-copays/story-JGKJZPswk9ZKDBJr7A7JII.html
17-06-2020||World||US urges North Korea to avoid further ‘counterproductive’ steps||The United States on Tuesday urged North Korea to avoid further “counterproductive” steps after it blew up a liaison office on the border with the South.“The United States fully supports the ROK’s efforts on inter-Korean relations and urges the DPRK to refrain from further counterproductive actions,” a State Department spokesperson said, referring to the South and North by their official names.North Korea blew up an inter-Korean liaison office on its side of the border on Tuesday, triggering broad international condemnation after days of virulent rhetoric from Pyongyang.The demolition came after Kim Yo Jong -- the powerful sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un -- said at the weekend the “useless north-south joint liaison office” would soon be seen “completely collapsed”.Footage of the explosion released by Seoul’s presidential Blue House showed a blast rolling across several buildings just across the border in Kaesong, with a nearby tower partially collapsing as clouds of smoke rose into the sky.Analysts say Pyongyang may be seeking to manufacture a crisis to increase pressure on Seoul while nuclear negotiations with Washington are at a standstill.After an emergency meeting, the National Security Council said it would “react strongly” if Pyongyang “continues to take steps that aggravate the situation”.“All responsibility for repercussions stemming from this action falls squarely on the North,” it added. The US, European Union and Russia all called for restraint.The EU warned Pyongyang against taking further “provocative and damaging steps”.The liaison office -- in a dormant industrial zone where Southern companies once employed Northern workers -- was opened in September 2018, days before the South’s President Moon Jae-in flew to Pyongyang for his third summit with Kim.Around 20 officials from each side were stationed at the office during subsequent months.But inter-Korean relations soured following the collapse of the Hanoi summit between Kim and US President Donald Trump in February last year over sanctions relief and what the North would be willing to give up in return.Operations at the office were suspended in January because of the coronavirus pandemic.And since early June, North Korea has issued a series of vitriolic condemnations of the South over activists sending anti-Pyongyang leaflets over the border -- something defectors do on a regular basis.Pyongyang’s official Korean Central News Agency said Tuesday the liaison office’s destruction was in line with “the mindset of the enraged people to surely force human scum and those who have sheltered the scum to pay dearly for their crimes”.Last week Pyongyang announced it was severing all official communication links with Seoul.“North Korea has started a provocation cycle with stages of escalation,” said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul, calling the destruction of the office “a symbolic blow to inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation”. “The Kim regime is also signalling the United States won’t have the luxury of keeping North Korea on the back-burner for the remainder of the year,” he added.- Relations soured -Since Pyongyang condemned the leaflet launches -- usually attached to hot air balloons or floated in bottles -- the Unification ministry has filed a police complaint against two defector groups and warned of a “thorough crackdown” against activists.On Monday, the left-leaning Moon urged the North not to “close the window of dialogue”.The two Koreas remain technically at war after Korean War hostilities ended with an armistice in 1953 that was never replaced with a peace treaty.Last week the North criticised Trump in a stinging denunciation of the US on the second anniversary of the Singapore summit, with its foreign minister Ri Son Gwon accusing Washington of seeking regime change.US diplomats insist that they believe Kim promised in Singapore to give up his nuclear arsenal, something Pyongyang has taken no steps to do.The North is under multiple international sanctions over its banned weapons programmes.It believes it deserves to be rewarded for its moratorium on nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile tests and the disabling of its atomic test site, along with the return of jailed US citizens and remains of soldiers killed in the Korean War.“Nothing is more hypocritical than an empty promise,” Ri said in his statement, carried by the official KCNA news agency.Cheong Seong-chang, director of the Sejong Institute’s Center for North Korean Studies, said: “North Korea is frustrated that the South has failed to offer an alternative plan to revive the US-North talks, let alone create a right atmosphere for the revival.“It has concluded the South has failed as a mediator in the process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-urges-north-korea-to-avoid-further-counterproductive-steps/story-35ELNOtQATgQRowGRtxGZJ.html
17-06-2020||World||Police choke holds to be ‘banned’ unless threat to life: US President Trump||US President Donald Trump responded to nationwide anger at racism and deadly police violence Tuesday with measures aimed at reforming police forces, including a push to end dangerous choke holds during arrests.In a Rose Garden ceremony attended by police and Republican congressional allies, but no black civil rights representatives or political opponents, Trump said “we have to break old patterns of failure.”The president has limited power over policing, which is run mostly at a state and local level. However, Trump said that he would use access to federal funding grants as leverage to persuade departments “to adopt the highest professional standards.”His executive order encourages de-escalation training, better recruitment, sharing of data on police who have bad records, and money to support police in complicated duties related to people with mental or drug issues.A highlight of Trump’s proposals, which he said could be complimented by legislation being negotiated in the Republican-controled Senate, was ending choke holds “except if an officer’s life is at risk,” he said.Praise for police Trump began by announcing he’d just met in private with families of several black people killed in encounters with the police.“We are one nation. We grieve together and we heal together,” he said.However, Trump’s choice to keep the televised audience overwhelmingly white, male and focused on law enforcement representatives reinforced his message that racism has nothing to do with police violence.“Americans know the truth: without police, there is chaos, without law, there is anarchy and without safety, there is catastrophe,” Trump said. Only a “very tiny” number of police commit wrongdoing, he said in remarks that frequently veered into a campaign speech about his accomplishments.Democrats and civil rights groups say that full-scale rethinking of police culture, and even cuts in police funding, are needed to bring necessary change.“While the president has finally acknowledged the need for policing reform, one modest executive order will not make up for his years of inflammatory rhetoric and policies designed to roll back the progress made in previous years,” said the top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer.A first wave of unrest began more than three weeks ago, after the May 25 death of George Floyd, an African-American man, in Minneapolis.Floyd stopped breathing when an officer kneeled on his neck, having already handcuffed him during arrest for a minor offense. Amateur video of the incident sparked demonstrations nationwide and in some places looting and arson.New tension erupted last week after the death in Atlanta, Georgia, of Rayshard Brooks, another African American whom police say was shot in the back as he ran away from arresting officers, having grabbed one of their tasers and aimed it at them.Seeing public opinion shift less than five months before November’s presidential and congressional elections, Republicans are moving quickly not to be left behind on the highly emotional issue.According to a senior White House official, who spoke on condition of not being identified, Trump’s executive order was meant to deliver “the discussion that the country needs to have... and hopefully bring some unification and some healing.”Campaign slogan But Trump has struck a hardline tone throughout the tense period, sparking uproar even from his own party with his warning that he could send federal troops to cities unable to control the crowds.The president clearly felt that the tough approach played well with his base, a passionately loyal minority of the electorate that he hopes will power him to a win, however narrow, in November. The slogan “law and order” has become a new pillar of his reelection campaign platform.Trump’s frequently lukewarm attempts to express empathy for the fear and powerlessness that many black Americans say they feel on a daily basis when encountering police left a vacuum that his Democratic opponent Joe Biden is seeking to fill.“Systemic racism pervades every part of our society, including law enforcement -- and we have to do the hard work to root it out,” Biden tweeted Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-choke-holds-to-be-banned-unless-threat-to-life-trump/story-6kfpgwg1nolxi5xY3GifjJ.html
17-06-2020||World||A ‘mistake’? PM Boris merges foreign, aid departments||Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday announced the merger of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the Department for International Development (DfID) as part of his vision for a ‘Global Britain’, but it was soon panned by critics as a ‘mistake’. Former Prime Minister David Cameron welcomed the intention to retain the UK’s commitment to spend 0.7 per cent of its GDP on international aid, but said “the decision to merge the departments is a mistake”. The new department is to be called Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.Cameron tweeted: “More could and should be done to co-ordinate aid and foreign policy…but the end of @DFID_UK will mean less expertise, less voice for development at the top table and ultimately less respect for the UK overseas”.Labour and campaign groups such as Oxfam criticised the move as Johnson outlined the merger to take effect from September to “unite aid with our diplomacy” as part of what he called “long overdue reform” in Whitehall. The DfID was created in 1997; the UK no longer gives aid to India but funds some projects.Former Prime Minister Tony Blair expressed dismay: “I am utterly dismayed by the decision to abolish DfID. We created DfID in 1997 to play a strong, important role in projecting British soft power. It has done so to general global acclaim”.“The strategic aims of alignment and diplomacy and focus on new areas of strategic interest to Britain could be accomplished without its abolition. Wrong and regressive move”.Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown also opposed the move, reiterating his view that the merger “would essentially solve one big problem – the rundown of Britain’s diplomatic service – by creating a much larger problem: the loss of Britain’s soft power”.Labour leader Keir Starmer said there was “no rationale” for the merger, while Conservative MP Andrew Mitchell, who was international development secretary from 2010 to 2012, said abolishing the department would be a “quite extraordinary mistake”.According to Johnson, the merger will give more powers to British ambassadors.He said in a statement to the House of Commons: “The Foreign Secretary will be empowered to decide which countries receive – or cease to receive – British aid, while delivering a single UK strategy for each country, overseen by the National Security Council, which I chair”.“Those strategies will be implemented on the ground by the relevant UK Ambassador, who will lead all of the Government’s work in the host country. And in this we are following the examples of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, all of whom run their development programmes from their foreign ministries”.“And we will align other British assets overseas, including our trade commissioners, who will come under the authority of the UK ambassador, bringing more coherence to our international presence”, he added.Oxfam GB chief executive Danny Sriskandarajah joined the voices opposing the merger: “It is scarcely believable that at a time when decades of progress are under threat from Covid, the prime minister has decided to scrap DfID, a world leader in the fight against poverty”.“This decision puts politics above the needs of the poorest people and will mean more people around the world will die unnecessarily from hunger and disease. The Foreign Office may be excellent at diplomacy but it has a patchy record of aid delivery and is not as transparent as DfID”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-mistake-pm-boris-merges-foreign-aid-departments/story-uSD0Fjhp7L5BeKWysUM91J.html

The Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying made the remarks in the backdrop of reports in Indian media, which said that the armies of India and China had undertaken a “limited disengagement” in eastern Ladakh to demonstrate intent to end the month-long border standoff ahead of another round of military talks on Wednesday. Asked about the reports of the troops on both sides disengaging and moving back to their previous positions, Hua only said at the regular ministry briefing that both sides are taking steps to ease the situation along the borders. Also Watch | India-China tension: Defence minister Rajnath Singh’s first message on tussle She did not specifically refer to the military talks that India and China held on Saturday to resolve the problem “Recently the diplomatic and military channels of China and India held effective communication on the situation along the border and reached positive consensus,” she said. Also read | India, China disengage in three sectors at LAC“The two sides are following this consensus to take actions to ease the situation along the borders,” Hua added. Last week, the Chinese foreign ministry had said the situation along the border was “stable and controllable”. Anonymous sources in New Delhi have told the media that the two armies have begun “disengagement” around patrolling points 14 and 15 in Galwan Valley and another in the Hot Spring area, adding the Chinese side has even moved back up to 1.5 km in two areas. The trigger for the latest round of standoff was China’s opposition to India laying a key road near the Pangong Tso Lake besides constructing another road connecting the Darbuk-Shayok-Daulat Beg Oldie road in Galwan Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ladakh-stand-off-china-refuses-to-share-details-of-disengagement-says-effort-to-ease-situation-on/story-ywrMhONPE1gEEr7x2dOEPN.html
17-06-2020||World||‘Actions that authoritarian regimes take’: Pompeo on Chinese aggression along LAC||US secretary of state Mike Pompeo said on Monday China has moved up its forces along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) with India and has made “continued efforts” to expand militarily in several places.Earlier this month, China had moved a large number of its troops to four points in Ladakh sector’s Galwan Valley and Pangong Tso area. It has turned out to be the biggest confrontation between the two countries after the Doklam episode in 2017.That was in an apparent effort to browbeat the Indian side to stop border construction projects including a 60-metre concrete bridge being built near Daulat Beg Oldie, the last military post south of the Karakoram Pass.On Sunday, the Indian Army dismissed a video purportedly showing a clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers in eastern Ladakh describing it as “malafide.”The two-and-a-half-minute video ostensibly shows a brawl between Indian and Chinese troops on the banks of the Pangong lake.“We see even today increasing forces of China moved up to the north of India on the Line of Actual Control there on the Indian border. These are the kinds of actions that authoritarian regimes take and they have a real impact…” Pompeo told Marc Thiessen and Danielle Pletka of AEI’s ‘What The Hell Is Going On In The World’ podcast.The top US official also mentioned “Hong Kongers in Hong Kong” and said the United States has a responsibility and the capability to push back against that, “ensure that the American people are properly served by foreign policy that recognizes the threats that emanate from China today”.Pompeo, responding to a question, said that the recent Chinese actions on the Indian border or Hong Kong or the South China Sea have been part of the Chinese behaviour in the recent past.“…It’s not just over the past six months. We’ve seen over the past number of years, continued Chinese build-out of the military capabilities and then continually more aggressive action. I mentioned India. You mentioned the South China Sea,” he said. “We see these same kinds of things with them attempting to build ports around the world as part of their Belt and Road Initiative, places where they can move the People’s Liberation Army, Navy. We’ve seen their continued efforts to expand militarily,” he said.For the past 20 years, the US has not responded to these things in a real way, he said.“We’ve viewed the 1.5 billion people in the Chinese market as so important to the American economy, and the risk that the Chinese would respond by closing us out for the favour of some other nation – I think people have just been too worried about that to actually take the responses that we take to every other country that behaves in the way that China has done,” Pompeo said.President Donald Trump’s approach has been different, he said.“Trump’s made it very clear whether it’s the signature issue on trade... reciprocal trade... and now beginning to move to all the other elements of power that the Chinese Communist Party is trying to expand,” he added. The Communist Party of China (CPC) continues to hide and obfuscate and delay the global response to the coronavirus pandemic that began in Wuhan. It has taken actions destroying the freedom of Hong Kong’s people, he said.“Those are just two pieces of the behaviour of this regime of the Chinese Communist Party. The nature and the activity that they’re undertaking, the continued efforts to steal intellectual property, to advance in the South China Sea,” he said.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/actions-that-authoritarian-regimes-take-mike-pompeo-on-chinese-aggression-along-lac/story-B788qyAmtLfP5aqO5FZ8BP.html
17-06-2020||World||China bans import of pigs, wild boar from India because of African swine fever||China, the biggest consumer of pork in the world, has banned the import of pigs and wild boars from India to prevent the spread of the African swine fever (ASF), Chinese customs and agricultural ministry have announced. According to a state media report, the General Administration of Customs of China and the Ministry of Agricultural and Rural Affairs took the decision following cases of ASF being discovered among domestic pigs and wild boar in Assam earlier in May.Details of the ban’s impact could not be immediately ascertained.The ban has taken effect China strives to restore pig production after the deadly disease ravaged its massive herd last year, a Reuters report said.“A sharp 29% plunge in first-quarter output underlines the extent of the impact from the disease and the huge task the sector faces in trying to rebuild after African swine fever killed millions of pigs since August 2018,” the agency reported in April.The ASF outbreak and culling of hogs slashed China’s pork output to a 16-year low of 42.6 million tonnes in 2019, while some experts estimate the sow herd shrank by at least 60% last year after the disease spread throughout the country.In December, tighter border controls put in place by China because of the ASF had impacted the export of buffalo meat from India.A report in the nationalistic tabloid Global Times linked China’s decision to ban pig imports from India was linked to the recent Sino-India tension at the border.It pointed out that the ban comes “…after tensions between the two countries flared up in Galwan Valley region due to India’s recent, illegal construction of defence facilities on the border to Chinese territory”.The charge has been categorically denied by India, which says its Chinese troops who are trying to change the status quo along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bans-import-of-pigs-wild-boar-from-india-because-of-african-swine-fever/story-jDqLZy3VM6d3a72BvYKmBM.html
17-06-2020||World||Situation at Sino-India boundary ‘stable and controllable’, says China||China on Wednesday said the situation at Sino-India boundary was “stable and controllable” and indicated bilateral negotiations were on at diplomatic and military levels to de-escalate tension between border troops.The Chinese foreign ministry said it was firm about protecting its territorial sovereignty.Indian and Chinese soldiers are said to be locked eyeball-to-eyeball at four locations along the line of actual control (LAC), which experts said could escalate into a standoff more serious in nature than the one that chilled ties in Doklam (Donglang in Chinese) in 2017.Reports say thousands of troops have been amassed by both sides in an evolving situation. Answering a question on whether talks were on to de-escalate the situation, foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said: “I think we have established border-related mechanisms and diplomatic channels. This includes the communication between border troops, and between our diplomatic missions”.“Between the two countries, we have good border-related mechanism and communication channels. We are capable of resolving related issues properly though dialogue and consultation,” he said at the regular ministry briefing on Wednesday.He neither confirmed nor denied a question on reports, which said China had deployed more than 5,000 troops at the flashpoints.Zhao said China was following the “important consensus” reached by the two leaders of India and China and was “…strictly observing the agreements between the two countries”.“We are committed to safeguarding our territorial sovereignty and security and safeguarding peace and stability in the border areas. Now, the China-India border area situation is overall stable and controllable,” Zhao.China has so far not released details about the situation on the ground.It had denied being the aggressor in a statement to the Hindustan Times on May 19.“For some time now, the Indian army has crossed in Chinese territory in the western and Sikkim sections of the China-India border, obstructing the normal patrol and operation of Chinese border troops and attempting to unilaterally change the state quo of border control. China has to take necessary countermeasures,” the foreign ministry statement said.Tensions have flared between border troops this month; in Naku La, in north Sikkim, where 150 soldiers were involved in a tense clash a day earlier, and also near Pangong Lake in the Ladakh sector.While not sharing details, Beijing has allowed state-controlled media to publish comment pieces blaming India for the current situation.“India in recent days has illegally constructed defense facilities across the border into Chinese territory in the Galwan Valley region, leaving Chinese border defense troops no other options but making necessary moves in response, and mounting the risk of escalating standoffs and conflicts between the two sides,” Long Xingchun, president of the Chengdu Institute of World Affairs wrote in the nationalistic and state-controlled tabloid, Global Times.Long added that unlike previous standoffs, the latest border friction was not caused by accident, but was a planned move of New Delhi.“India has been clearly and definitely aware that the Galwan Valley region is Chinese territory. But according to media reports, since early May, India has been crossing the boundary line into the Galwan Valley region and entering Chinese territory”.“Indian soldiers have also deliberately instigated conflicts with their Chinese counterparts. If India failed to stop such provocations as soon as possible, it will impact on Beijing-New Delhi ties - and may even exceed the sort of intensity of the Doklam standoff,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/situation-at-sino-india-boundary-stable-and-controllable-says-china/story-syyKZxx6OrR72brUlB8aTP.html
