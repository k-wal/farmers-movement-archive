Tests were carried out for the novel coronavirus and the passengers were taken to a quarantine hotel, authorities said. Those who tested positive will be in quarantine for 14 days, and those who tested negative will remain in quarantine for seven days, the civil protection ministry said.Those who tested positive include nine people from Pakistan with Greek residency papers, two Greeks travelling from Australia and a member of a Greek-Japanese family. The suspension will be in place until June 15.Greece has reported a low number of COVID-19 cases compared to many other European countries, and began a gradual easing of a weeks-long lockdown on May 4. By Tuesday, it had reported 2,937 cases, and 179 deaths.

The mosque is located in a high-security diplomatic area near the offices of several international organizations and embassies.Mullah Mohammad Ayaz Niazi was one of two people killed in the attack, Arian said. He was wounded in the attack and died later at a hospital.Niazi was a well known cleric who was active as Friday prayer leader at the mosque. He was also a Kabul University professor in the Islamic Law department.Sediq Sediqqi, spokesman for Afghan President Ashraf Ghani tweeted that the government strongly condemned the attack, saying it “reveals the brutality and inhumanity of those who purposefully perpetrate violence against our Ulema and innocent people.”No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack, but the Islamic State group has been active in Kabul in recent weeks and has in the past carried out attacks inside mosques in Afghanistan.Taliban insurgents have never carried out an attack inside of a mosque.The IS claimed responsibility for the roadside bomb attack against a bus belonging to a local TV station in Kabul on Saturday, killing two employees of the station.Attacks against worshippers have increased in Afghanistan: Last month, an unknown number of attackers stormed a mosque in northern Parwan province, killed 11 worshipers and wounded several others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-killed-2-wounded-in-kabul-mosque-bombing-afghan-official/story-pB5pcSc8wDtvY8mEnyL1BL.html
02-06-2020||World||Five police officers shot, wounded in US protests||At least five U.S. police officers were shot and wounded during violent protests over the death of a black man in police custody, police and media said, hours after President Donald Trump vowed to deploy the military if unrest did not stop. Trump deepened outrage on Monday by posing at a church across from the White House clutching a Bible after law enforcement officers used teargas and rubber bullets to clear protesters.The U.S. Secret Service, charged with protecting the president, on Tuesday closed down until further notice the streets around the White House, media reports said. Demonstrators set fire to a strip mall in Los Angeles, looted stores in New York City and clashed with police in St Louis, Missouri, where four officers were taken to hospital with non-life-threatening injuries.An emotional St. Louis police commissioner, John Hayden, said about 200 protesters were looting and hurling fireworks and rocks at officers.“They had officers with gas poured on them. What is going on? How can this be? Mr Floyd was killed somewhere else and they are tearing up cities all across the country,” he told reporters.A police officer was shot during protests in Las Vegas, police there said in a statement. Another officer was “involved in a shooting” in the same area, the police said. Officers were injured in clashes elsewhere, including one who was in critical condition after being hit by a car in the Bronx, police said.Trump, a Republican, has condemned the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American who died after a white policeman pinned his neck under a knee for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis on May 25, and has promised justice. But, with marches and rallies for racial equality and against police brutality having turned violent late each day in the last week, he said rightful protests could not be drowned out by an “angry mob.” “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,” Trump said.Floyd’s death has reignited simmering racial tensions in a politically divided country that has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, with African Americans accounting for a disproportionately high number of cases. Democratic Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker on Tuesday urged patience, saying Americans could work through these tough issues. He pledged to take legal action if Trump carried out his military threat.“We can bring down the temperature, but not when the president ... is standing up calling for troops, and law and order, and domination,” he told MSNBC. “We will fight him, and we will take it to federal court.” Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser, in a separate MSNBC interview on Tuesday, said there were no signs of active duty U.S. military in the city overnight.CRITICISM OF CHURCH VISITAfter his address, Trump posed for pictures with his daughter, Ivanka, and U.S. Attorney General William Barr at St. John’s Episcopal Church near the White House.The presiding bishop of the Episcopal Church diocese in Washington D. C., Michael Curry, was among those who criticized Trump’s use of the historic church for a photo opportunity.“In so doing, he used a church building and the Holy Bible for partisan political purposes,” he said on Twitter. The church suffered minor fire damage during protests on Sunday night.On Tuesday, Trump was scheduled to visit the Saint John Paul II National Shrine in Washington.In New York, television images showed crowds smashing windows and looting luxury stores along Fifth Avenue in Manhattan before the city’s 11 p.m. curfew. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the curfew would be moved to 8 p.m. on Tuesday.In Hollywood, dozens of people were shown in television images looting a drug store. Windows were shattered at a nearby Starbucks and two restaurants. AUTOPSIESA second autopsy ordered by Floyd’s family and released on Monday found his death was homicide by “mechanical asphyxiation,” meaning physical force interfered with his oxygen supply. The report said three officers contributed to his death. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner later released autopsy findings that also called Floyd’s death homicide by asphyxiation. The county report said Floyd suffered cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by police and that he had arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use.Derek Chauvin, the 44-year-old Minneapolis police officer who planted his knee on Floyd’s neck, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved have not been charged. Dozens of cities are under curfews not seen since riots after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The National Guard deployed in 23 states and Washington, D.C.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-police-officers-shot-wounded-in-us-protests/story-VdYeNbVBdLPmqbPJ46xn3N.html

02-06-2020||World||6,500 Pak terrorists among foreign fighters in Afghanistan; LeT, JeM play key role: UN report||There are some 6,500 Pakistani nationals among foreign terrorists operating in Afghanistan and the Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM) and Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) play a key role in bringing foreign fighters into the war-torn country, according to a UN report.The report, from the UN Security Council’s analytical support and sanctions monitoring team and issued late last month, indicated Pakistani terrorists formed a significant part of foreign fighters that pose a serious threat to Afghanistan’s security because of their activities and permanent presence in the country.The report said the Afghan Taliban’s role as a credible counter-terrorism partner for the world community in the aftermath of the February agreement with the US will need careful monitoring because of the “number of foreign terrorist fighters in search of a purpose and livelihood in Afghanistan, including up to 6,500 Pakistanis”.Reacting to the report, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava expressed “serious concern” to the continued presence in Afghanistan of the senior leadership of al-Qaeda and a large number of foreign terrorists, including 6,500 Pakistan nationals. The report, he said, “vindicates India’s long-standing position that Pakistan remains the epicentre of international terrorism”.There have been reports since last year of the JeM and LeT, both blamed for high-profile attacks in India, sending hundreds of fighters to Afghanistan following increased pressure on Pakistan from the world community to crack down on terror groups.Also read: Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar’s kin linked to foiled J&K plotThe UN report said Afghan officials highlighted Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), JeM and LeT among the foreign groups posing a security threat. All three groups have a presence in the eastern Afghan provinces of Kunar, Nangarhar and Nuristan, “where they operate under the umbrella of the Afghan Taliban”, the report said.Afghan interlocutors said JeM and LeT “facilitate the trafficking of terrorist fighters into Afghanistan, who act as advisers, trainers and specialists in improvised explosive devices”.The report added: “Both groups are responsible for carrying out targeted assassinations against government officials and others. Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-i-Mohammed were stated to have approximately 800 and 200 armed fighters, respectively, co-located with Taliban forces in Mohmand Darah, Dur Baba and Sherzad Districts of Nangarhar Province.”Also read: Afghan reporter killed as govt says ready for Taliban dialogueIn Kunar province, LeT “retains a further 220 fighters” and JeM “has a further 30, all of whom are dispersed within Taliban forces”, according to the report.The TTP in Afghanistan is led by Noor Wali Mehsud and the group is thought to have about 500 fighters in Kunar and about 180 in Nangarhar.External affairs ministry spokesperson Srivastava said UN-designated entities such as LeT and JeM, “operating from Pakistan-controlled territories [were] facilitating trafficking and imparting training to other terrorists in Afghanistan”.He added, “This vindicates India’s long-standing position that Pakistan remains the epicentre of international terrorism. That proscribed terrorist entities and individuals continue to enjoy safe havens and recruit, train, arm, finance and operate with impunity from Pakistan with state support. They inflict violence and spread terrorism in the region and other parts of the world.”Pakistan, Srivastava said, has failed in fulfilling its international obligations, including under UN Security Council resolutions and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), to “put an end to support to terrorism emanating from territories under its control”. The world community should hold Pakistan accountable and seek sustained, verifiable and irreversible action against terrorism, he said.The UN report also highlighted the close and enduring links between the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda despite the signing of the agreement with the US in February. The agreement provided for the drawdown of American troops in exchange for counter-terrorism measures by the Afghan Taliban and intra-Afghan talks aimed at a permanent ceasefire.“Early indications are that many, if not all, of these objectives will prove challenging,” the report said.The report further said the Haqqani Network – a key component of the Afghan Taliban which Indian and Afghan officials have long contended has ties with Pakistan’s military establishment – continues to be close to al-Qaeda. It added that al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri met members of the Haqqani Network as recently as February.The report also highlighted the presence of Pakistani terrorists in the Islamic State’s Khorasan chapter, such as commander Abdullah Orakzai alias Aslam Farooqi, who was captured with 21 others in Kandahar in March. Twelve Pakistani nationals were captured along with Farooqi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-500-pak-terrorists-among-foreign-fighters-in-afghanistan-let-jem-play-key-role-un-report/story-76JHLj88PxYajUYtEgjTLN.html

02-06-2020||World||Russia backing antiviral drug Avifavir for Covid-19 fight good news for India, say scientists||Russia’s approval of the antiviral drug Avifavir to treat Covid-19 is good news for India as it is based on an influenza medication already in advanced clinical trials here, say scientists.Avifavir, described by its developers in Russia as perhaps the most promising anti Covid-19 drug in the world, is derived from Favipiravir.  Mumbai-based Glenmark Pharmaceuticals announced last week that Favipiravir is under phase 3 clinical trials -- the penultimate stage in drug testing -- in India.Stating that Avifavir has shown high efficacy in treating patients with coronavirus during clinical trials, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) on Monday said it will deliver 60,000 courses of the drug to Russian hospitals in June.It also said Avifavir has become the first Favipiravir-based drug in the world to be approved for the treatment of COVID-19, it said. The close derivative link between Avifavir and Favipiravir is reason for hope in India too, said scientists here. Favipiravir has anyway been in discussion and a point of interest in the recent past, said Arup Kumar Banerjee from the North Bengal Medical College and Hospital, Siliguri.He noted that Favipiravir is available under the name of Avigan for influenza and is often recommended for viral infections such as bunyavirus, filovirus and arenavirus.“It is  prescribed for severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS), a viral hemorrhagic fever with high fatality rate and is effective against all strains of influenza viruses,” Banerjee told PTI. “Vaccine is important, so is antiviral. We need to develop both side by side. Today, if anybody comes up with a drug against COVID 19 irrespective of country or origin, it is a good news subject to validation of the same in large scale. Hence, the same applies to this derivative as well,” he added.Avifavir, developed by a joint venture between RDIF and ChemRar Group, is designed to disrupt the ability of the novel coronavirus to reproduce.“Avifavir is not only the first antiviral drug registered against coronavirus in Russia, but it is also perhaps the most promising anti Covid-19 drug in the world,” RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev said in a statement.The RDIF and the ChemRar Group last week announced that Avifavir has received a temporary registration certificate from the Russian Ministry of Health. “Avifavir is a drug that as per available information is being tested by Russia against COVID 19 and is based on Favipiravir, a drug that is known to have inhibitory function against RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) activity of a virus,” said virologist Upasana Ray.RdRP is an essential protein encoded in the genes of RNA-containing viruses.“Favipiravir has been shown earlier to inhibit the influenza virus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase,” Ray, senior scientist at CSIR-IICB in Kolkata, told PTI.RNA polymerase is a viral enzyme that helps in replication or reproduction of the viral RNA, that is the genetic material. Hence, a drug that inhibits this activity would basically curb the functional multiplication of the virus, she explained.Glenmark last week announced a new randomised study in India to test the combined efficacy of Favipiravir and another antiviral drug Umifenovir as a potential COVID-19 treatment strategy.Glenmark also said that it is conducting Phase 3 clinical trials of Favipiravir as a COVID-19 therapy option with 150 patients, enrolled from nine leading government and private hospitals across the country.“So far, 30 patients have been randomised. The monotherapy phase 3 clinical trial results are expected by July or August 2020,” the company said in a statement last week.Glenmark said it is the first pharmaceutical company to receive approval from drug regulator Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) to conduct Favipiravir clinical trials against COVID-19 in India.Favipiravir is an oral antiviral drug approved in Japan in 2014 for the treatment of novel or re-emerging influenza virus infections. It has a unique mechanism of action by which it inhibits viral replication or reproduction, it said. “Since it (Favipiravir) was earlier tested for influenza, they (researchers) could bypass initial toxicity tests etc. It was one of (hundreds) of clinical trials against SARS-COV-2. With preliminary data for the clinical trials looking positive they jumped on it,” Durba Sengupta, from CSIR-National Chemical Laboratory in Pune, Maharashtra, told PTI. Sengupta said the drug acts on one of the main proteins that is responsible for RNA-replication.He also injected a note of caution.Till the clinical trial results are properly reported, it is difficult to say how effective it will be.“One has to be definitely cautious. First, it’s not designed to target this particular virus, and it is RdRP, so the binding may be weaker than in influenza,” Sengupta said. Though it is unknown how the different viral strains will bind, she said it is one of the better options right now.Another point, Sengupta noted, is that the drug’s action is on the same target as the antiviral remdesivir, one of the top possible drug contenders for COVID-19.“I think several people thought that remdesvir would be quite promising -- but it has been ambiguous so far. Getting robust clinical data in such short times is really tricky. It is really difficult to say without the actual clinical data and looking at the statistics,” she added.  India’s drug regulator has granted US pharma giant Gilead Sciences marketing authorisation for remdesivir for “restricted emergency use” on hospitalised COVID-19 patients in view of the crisis posed by the pandemic.The approval process for remdesivir was accelerated in view of the emergency situation and the unmet need for medicines in light of the coronavirus outbreak, a source in the know of the developments told PTI.

02-06-2020||World||Will stand by people of Hong Kong, UK tells China||The Boris Johnson government on Tuesday urged China to re-consider its new security law for Hong Kong, but if it failed to do so, the United Kingdom will offer pathways to full citizenship to holders of British National (Overseas) status in the former colony. Foreign secretary Dominic Raab said in a statement in the House of Commons that “the UK will not just look the other way when it comes to the people of Hong Kong. We will stand by them, we will live up to our responsibilities”.There is cross-party consensus in the UK over official response to China’s new law, which is perceived as curtailing political and other freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong citizens under the Sino-British Joint Declaration signed before it was handed over to China in 1997.Raab’s announcement last week that the UK would offer pathways to citizenship to Hong Kong people prompted an angry response from Beijing, where it was seen as interference in the country’s internal affairs.Raab told MPs: “(We) are not seeking to intervene in China’s internal affairs. Only to hold China to its international commitments, just as China expects of the United Kingdom. We don’t seek to prevent China’s rise”.“Far from it, we welcome China as a leading member of the international community, and we look to engage with China on everything from trade to climate change. And it is precisely because we recognise China’s role in the world that we expect it to live up to the international obligations, and international responsibilities, that come with it”.Seven former foreign secretaries have urged the Johnson government to lead the international response to Beijing’s move. Soon after China’s National People’s Congress adopted the new law on May 28, four countries – UK, US, Australia and Canada – expressed ‘deep concern’.Raab reiterated the offer of citizenship to holders of BNO status, estimated to be nearly 2 million (about 3 lakh current holders of the passport and others eligible to acquire the status).He said: “The House will recall that BNO status was conferred on British Dependent Territories Citizens connected with Hong Kong as part of the package of arrangements that accompanied the Joint Declaration in 1984, in preparation for the handover of the territory”.“And under that status, currently, BNO passport holders are already entitled to UK consular assistance in third countries. And the British government also provides people with BNO passports visa-free entry into the UK for up to six months as visitors”.“If China follows through with its proposed legislation, we will put in place new arrangements to allow BNOs to come to the UK without the current 6 month limit, enabling them to live and apply to study and work for extendable periods of 12 months, thereby also providing a pathway to citizenship”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-stand-by-people-of-hong-kong-uk-tells-china/story-Y4OJnHy6OSYXPyqFcQ7wIO.html
02-06-2020||World||Covid-19 pandemic antibiotics surge will cause more deaths: WHO||Increased antibiotics use in combating the Covid-19 pandemic will strengthen bacterial resistance and ultimately lead to more deaths during the crisis and beyond, the World Health Organization said Monday.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said a “worrying number” of bacterial infections were becoming increasingly resistant to the medicines traditionally used to treat them.The UN health agency said it was concerned that the inappropriate use of antibiotics during the coronavirus crisis would further fuel the trend.“The Covid-19 pandemic has led to an increased use of antibiotics, which ultimately will lead to higher bacterial resistance rates that will impact the burden of disease and deaths during the pandemic and beyond,” Tedros told a virtual press conference from the WHO’s Geneva headquarters.The WHO said only a small proportion of Covid-19 patients needed antibiotics to treat subsequent bacterial infections.The organisation has issued guidance to medics not to provide antibiotic therapy or prophylaxis to patients with mild Covid-19, or to patients with moderate illness without a clinical suspicion of bacterial infection.Tedros said the guidelines said should help tackle antimicrobial resistance while saving lives.He called the threat of antimicrobial resistance “one of the most urgent challenges of our time”.“It’s clear that the world is losing its ability to use critically important antimicrobial medicines,” he said.Highlighting inappropriate usage, he said there was an “overuse” of antibiotics in some countries, while in low-income states, such life-saving medicines were unavailable, “leading to needless suffering and death”.- Disease treatment disrupted -Meanwhile the WHO said the prevention and treatment of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) had been severely disrupted since the Covid-19 pandemic began in December, following a survey of 155 countries.“This situation is of significant concern because people living with NCDs are at higher risk of severe Covid-19-related illness and death,” it said.The survey, during a three-week period in May, found that low-income countries were most affected.Some 53 percent of countries reported partially or completely disrupted services for hypertension treatment.The figure was 49 percent for diabetes treatment and related complications; 42 percent for cancer treatment, and 31 percent for cardiovascular emergencies. The most common reasons for discontinuing or reducing services were cancellations of planned treatments, a decrease in available public transport and a lack of staff because health workers had been reassigned to COVID-19 treatment.- Mass gatherings risk -The WHO warned about the dangers of mass gatherings, as protests rage in the United States and elsewhere over the killing of unarmed black man George Floyd, and as sports events begin a tentative resumption.“Mass gatherings have the potential to act as super-spreading events,” warned Tedros, highlighting WHO guidance designed to help organisers determine how such events can be held safely.The WHO was asked about the street protests in the United States and the fear that they could increase the spread of the virus.“With increasing social mixing and people coming together, particularly in areas if the virus is not under control, that close contact between people can pose a risk,” answered the organisation’s Covid-19 technical lead Maria Van Kerkhove -- stressing that she was speaking about mass gatherings in general.People planning mass events should undertake a “very serious, rigorous risk assessment”, she said.“Physical distancing remains a very important aspect to control and suppression of transmission of Covid-19. This is not over yet,” the expert said.- South America yet to peak -The novel coronavirus has infected at least 6.2 million people and killed more than 373,000 since the outbreak first emerged in China last December, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP. WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said that infection rates in South America were “far from stable” following a rapid increase in cases.Brazil, Peru, Chile and Mexico were among the 10 reporting the highest new number of cases in the past 24 hours.“Central and South America in particular have very much become the intense zones for transmission of this virus,” Ryan said.“I don’t believe we have reached the peak in that transmission and, at this point, I cannot predict when we will.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pandemic-antibiotics-surge-will-cause-more-deaths-who/story-m7CWmU0Oc3mN1cR1ulVipK.html

The campaign will be difficult to replicate because of the massive mobilisation of resources required that includes deploying thousands of medics and setting up hundreds of temporary testing centres.Nearly 10 million tests could be completed in less than three weeks in Wuhan partly because medics also carried out batch testing of samples – maximum five samples at a time.If the batch result was positive, the individuals were separately tested.The cost for the tests was borne by the government.The total expenditure was around 900 million yuan or $126 million; an individual test cost 106 yuan or around $15.“The city had set up a maximum of 2907 sampling points in a single day, with more than 280,000 staff members and more than 50,000 medical staff participating in sampling and services,” Wang Weihua, deputy director of the Wuhan Municipal Health Commission said at a press conference in Wuhan on Tuesday.Also on June 1, the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control collected random swab samples of tap water and domestic sewage, and from taxis, buses, subway cars and stations, shopping malls, restaurants and parks, said Li Lanjuan, a member of the high-level expert group of the National Health and Health Commission and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering:A total of “…2314 samples, the test results are negative,” Li said.Hu Yabo, Wuhan’s deputy mayor said the testing will bring “peace of mind” to the residents of the city, which is gradually returning to normalcy.“It (the testing) will definitely promote urban economic and social development on the right track as soon as possible. This investment is totally worth it,” Hu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-wraps-up-covid-19-tests-300-silent-spreaders-isolated-from-10-million/story-x3274Uaf9ULRhaHYmsD7RK.html
02-06-2020||World||George Floyd family autopsy could help accused policeman’s defence, legal experts say||An independent autopsy that found George Floyd died solely from asphyxiation could actually bolster the defence of the former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing him, legal experts said.The autopsy released on Monday said Floyd’s death, which sparked nationwide protests, was a homicide and that he had no underlying medical conditions.Later on Monday, the Hennepin County Medical Examiner released details of its autopsy findings that also said Floyd’s death was a homicide caused by asphyxiation but that he had possible underlying health conditions and intoxicants in his body that may have been contributing factors in his death..On the surface, the independent autopsy would seem to bolster the prosecution’s case against Derek Chauvin, the police officer who knelt on Floyd’s neck for several minutes before he died last week.But legal experts said it could do the opposite by creating confusion in the mind of the jury.“It will be part of the defence strategy to say they can’t even get the cause of death right,” said Gerald Lefcourt, a criminal defence attorney.The independent report was prepared for the Floyd family by Dr. Allecia Wilson of the University of Michigan and Dr. Michael Baden, who has worked on several high-profile murder cases.Graphic video footage showed Chauvin, who is white, pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck. Floyd, a 46-year-old black man, gasped for air and repeatedly groaned: “Please, I can’t breathe,” while bystanders shouted at police to let him up.Chauvin was charged on Friday with third-degree murder and manslaughter. He has been fired from the Minneapolis police department.The video reignited an outpouring of rage that civil rights activists said has long simmered in cities across the country over persistent racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, who is leading the prosecution, is not obligated to use the independent autopsy or introduce it as evidence at trial.Dan Alonso, a former chief assistant district attorney in Manhattan, said the prosecution “wouldn’t be doing their job if they ignored it.”Former prosecutors and defence attorneys told Reuters that Chauvin faced a very difficult case given the strong video evidence.If prosecutors introduce the independent report, the defence could seize on the conflicting autopsies to create questions in the jury’s mind about the cause of death.Under U.S. law, prosecutors must prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Introducing the report would also allow the defence team to cross-examine Baden and use his long history of work in celebrity trials to cast him as a hired gun, according to defence attorneys.“This report created a lot of ammunition for a defence team to use in a criminal case or a subsequent civil case,” said Paul Callan, a former New York prosecutor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/george-floyd-family-autopsy-could-help-accused-policeman-s-defense-legal-experts-say/story-qL9kKDbqQVJ9hcsppNnM2N.html
02-06-2020||World||China’s Wuhan tests nearly 10 million people for Covid-19, finds only 300 infections||China tested almost 10 million people for coronavirus in just over two weeks in Wuhan, the city where the pandemic began, officials said Tuesday, reporting only a few hundred positive cases.Chinese authorities claim to have largely brought the virus under control but Wuhan officials -- wary of a second wave -- launched the programme after new infections emerged for the first time since the city re-opened in April following more than two months in lockdown.More than 9.8 million people were tested in the city of 11 million people between May 14 and June 1, officials said at a press conference.Officials added that the 300 positive results were among asymptomatic patients.“These numbers show that Wuhan is now the safest city,” said Feng Zijian, deputy director of China’s national Center for Disease Control and Prevention.Residents queued up across the city at makeshift sites set up under tents in parking lots, parks and residential communities to give nucleic acid test samples -- with roughly half a million such medical checks conducted every day during the period.China does not include asymptomatic cases in its tally of confirmed infections.No asymptomatic people were found to have infected others, said Lu Zuxun, a public health expert from Wuhan’s Huazhong University of Science and Technology.The city found a handful of asymptomatic cases on most days of the testing campaign, which was initially described as a 10-day “decisive battle,” but reported zero asymptomatic cases for the first time on Monday.The virus first emerged in Wuhan late last year, but cases have dwindled dramatically from the peak in mid-February as China appears to have brought the outbreak largely under control.The official death toll in the country of 1.4 billion people stands at 4,634 -- most in Wuhan, and well below the number of fatalities in much smaller countries.However, doubt has been cast on the reliability of China’s numbers and the United States has led the charge in questioning how much information Beijing has shared with the international community.Wuhan’s testing blitz cost the city government around 900 million yuan ($127 million), vice mayor Hu Yabo said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-wuhan-tests-nearly-10-million-people-finds-only-300-infections/story-KTH1vvSGOnXT2pktwcQvmN.html
02-06-2020||World||China to construct 1,124-megawatt power project in Pok under CPEC||China under the multi-billion-dollar CPEC will set up a 1,124-megawatt power project in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir despite India’s objection to it, according to a media report on Tuesday.The details of the Kohala hydropower project was presented in the 127th meeting of the Private Power and Infrastructure Board (PPIB) chaired by Energy Minister Omar Ayub on Monday. The Express Tribune reported that the meeting was informed that a tripartite agreement has been finalised among China’s Three Gorges Corporation, the authorities in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir (PoK) and the PPIB to implement the 1,124-megawatt Kohala hydroelectric power project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) framework.The project will be built on the Jhelum River and aims at annually providing more than five billion units of clean and low-cost electricity for consumers in Pakistan.The paper further reported that this marks one of the largest investments of USD 2.4 billion in an independent power producer (IPP) in the region.The 3,000-km-long CEPC is aimed at connecting China and Pakistan with rail, road, pipelines and optical cable fiber networks. It connects China’s Xinjiang province with Pakistan Gwadar port, providing access to China to the Arabian Sea.The CPEC passes through PoK, over which India has conveyed its protests to China. Last month, India protested to Pakistan awarding a mega contract to build a dam in Gilgit-Baltistan, saying carrying out of such projects in territories under Pakistan’s illegal occupation was not proper. The Pakistan government has signed a whopping Rs 442 billion contract with a joint venture of a Chinese state-run firm and a commercial arm of Pakistan’s powerful military for construction of the Diamer-Bhasha dam.“Our position is consistent and clear that entire territory of the Union Territories of Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh have been, are and will continue to be integral and inalienable part of India,” the Ministry of External Affairs said in New Delhi last month.“We have consistently conveyed our protests and shared concerns with both Pakistan and China on all such projects in the Indian territories under Pakistan’s illegal occupation,” it said. Ayub, a grandson of former military ruler Ayub Khan, in his remarks, lauded the infrastructure board for playing a crucial role in optimising hydroelectric power generation.He said the government was determined to ensure long-term energy sustainability and reliability for which renewable energy, hydroelectric power and indigenous coal-based projects were being prioritised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-construct-1-124-megawatt-power-project-in-pok-under-cpec/story-0O0wIsdDYL42gguWiqOdeJ.html

This shocking tragedy clearly crossed that line.” pic.twitter.com/Wn7EoTInzUFloyd, an African-American man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the country, some of which became violent.Woods’ statement comes one day after former NBA star and current Charlotte Hornets owner Michael Jordan made his first public remarks on Floyd and the killings of black people at the hands of police.“I see and feel everyone’s pain, outrage and frustration,” Jordan said in the statement posted on the Jordan brand’s social media accounts and the team’s Twitter account. “I stand with those who are calling out the ingrained racism and violence toward people of color in our country. We have had enough.”Woods grew up in Southern California, and he said he learned from the Los Angeles riots in 1992 that “education is the best path forward.” Thousands in the city’s largely minority south side took to the streets after an all-white jury acquitted four white police officers of attacking Rodney King, a black driver, after a traffic stop.“We can make our points without burning the very neighbourhoods we live in,” Woods said. “I hope that through constructive, honest conversations we can build a safer, unified society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiger-woods-speaks-out-for-first-time-since-george-floyd-s-death/story-e1hk5uSkYVB34pnIuqhg2K.html

Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg hosted a nearly hour-long video call with U.S. civil rights leaders to discuss ongoing issues around his company’s policies as they relate to race, elections and other topics. But participants were left disappointed, according to Color of Change President Rashad Robinson, who concluded that Zuckerberg can’t fully grasp the change they seek.In an interview with Bloomberg News immediately after the call, Robinson said that “the problem with my ongoing conversations with Mark, is that I feel like I spent a lot of time, and my colleagues spent a lot of time, explaining to him why these things are a problem, and I think he just very much lacks the ability to understand it.”These comments come at a time when the US is roiled by daily protests for racial justice triggered by the death of George Floyd, an African-American man, while in police custody in Minneapolis. Facebook has come in for criticism from within its own ranks, with an upswell of dismay among employees after the CEO adopted a hands-off approach to messages posted by President Donald Trump that seemed to threaten violence with the words “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”“His employees are outraged,” said Robinson. “I’ve got outreach from some of them. Saying Black Lives Matter, saying I’m going to give money, but having your policies actually hurt black people, people will know the difference.” Some of the company’s senior staff have taken to Twitter to make their discontent public.Facebook didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. In a statement sent to Axios, Facebook said it was “grateful that leaders in the civil rights community took the time to share candid, honest feedback.” The company added that “it is an important moment to listen, and we look forward to continuing these conversations.”Robinson also recently spoke up at a Facebook shareholder meeting and said he’s had dinner at Zuckerberg’s home and been on other calls with the CEO to talk about similar topics. Joining the Monday call was Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg. All of this effort from Facebook’s executive team suggests the company is serious at least about bringing civil rights leaders on its side, however Robinson expressed more frustration than hope.“He continues to do things and make decisions that hurt communities and put people in harm’s way and is not accountable for it,” said Robinson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zuckerberg-leaves-racial-justice-leader-frustrated-after-call/story-W7sFwWuS10iGxPEXRCmJQJ.html
02-06-2020||World||Indian-American doctors outraged at Floyd’s death, racial discrimination in the US||An influential community of Indian-American doctors in the US has expressed outrage at the custodial killing of George Floyd and the “long history” of racial discrimination in America, saying that the “divisive rhetoric” seem to be getting worse each day in the country.African-American Floyd, 46, died after a white police officer kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath till life left his body in Minneapolis on May 25. His death has triggered violent nationwide protests.Police have used tear gas to disperse the crowds and hundreds of people have been arrested as protests turned violent in some cities.The American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (AAPI), the largest body representing Indian-American doctors, in a statement on Monday condemned racial discrimination and violence against minority communities.“As American Physicians of Indian-origin, we are unanimously outraged by George Floyd’s death and the long history of racial discrimination that lives in this country. We are aware that these are difficult and distressing times for everyone,” said AAPI president Suresh Reddy.Reddy said that as physicians, they are dedicated to improving the health of everyone but they cannot fulfil this mission without directly confronting racism that is hurting the health of so many and contribute significantly to excess morbidity and death of the minority communities.Sudhakar Jonnalgadda, AAPI president-elect, said, “we are saddened by the divisive rhetoric and racial tensions that seem to be getting worse each day. We need to find solutions that ensure everyone in this nation receives fair and equal treatment and that police officers – who put their lives on the line every day to protect us all – are respected and supported.” AAPI endorsed the statement by American Medical Association (AMA), which described the “police violence as a striking reflection of our American legacy of racism— a system that assigns value and structures opportunity while unfairly advantaging some and disadvantaging others based on their skin colour and saps the strength of the whole society through the waste of human resources.” Sanku Rao, chair, AAPI Ethics and Grievance Committee, said that along with other leading health organisations, including American Medical Association, the Indian-American doctors denounce incidents of racism and violence that continue to ravage the communities.Standing in solidarity with peaceful protestors across the nation condemning the horrific death of George Floyd, AAPI secretary Ravi Kolli called out systemic racism and excessive violence by the nation’s police.“We call upon police departments across the country to, meaningfully address the twin problems of systemic racism and excessive, disproportionate use of force by officers in their ranks, working with local communities to end both, and hold accountable the police officers with misconduct and excessive force,” he said.Namratha R. Kandula, chair, AAPI’s Diversity and Equity Committee, said, “As immigrants to the US, our families may not always understand this history, but we join in solidarity with the minority communities and call for justice for George Floyd and for many others who have lost their lives to police brutality.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-american-doctors-outraged-at-floyd-s-death-racial-discrimination-in-the-us/story-cWSkPZdgSweDdYpbnN5peP.html
02-06-2020||World||Iran scientist acquitted in US trade secrets case deported||An Iranian scientist imprisoned in the US and acquitted in a federal trade secrets case is on his way back to Iran after being deported, the country’s foreign minister said Tuesday.Sirous Asgari was in the air on a flight back to Iran, Mohammad Javad Zarif said in an Instagram post.“Congratulations to his wife and his esteemed family,” Zarif wrote.Iran’s state-run IRNA news agency later reported the news, citing Zarif.Asgari, a professor at Iran’s Sharif University of Technology, had been indicted in April 2016, accused by federal prosecutors of trying to steal secret research from Case Western Reserve University. The Cleveland school had been working on a project for the US Navy Office of Naval Research to create and produce anti-corrosive stainless steel.Asgari ultimately was acquitted in November after US District Judge James Gwin tossed out the case by the prosecutors.Ken Cuccinelli, the acting deputy Homeland Security secretary, earlier told The Associated Press that the DHS had started to try to deport Asgari on Dec. 12 following his acquittal. However, he said, Iran refused to recognize him as legitimately Iranian and provide him with a valid passport until late February.Once Asgari received the passport, DHS made several attempts to fly him back to Iran, purchasing tickets for flights on March 10, March 18, March 23, April 1 and May 1, according to Cuccinelli. Each of those flights was cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, he said.Asgari’s supporters told The Guardian newspaper in April he had contracted the coronavirus while imprisoned. He had been held at Louisiana’s Winn Correctional Center by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement before his deportation, they said.Iran’s deputy education minister, Hossein Salar Amoli, recently said Asgari had recovered from the virus and would be able to travel, IRNA reported.Iranian officials had associated Asgari’s release with US prisoners held in Iran potentially being freed, something Cuccinelli strongly disputed. Iranian officials in recent days had been saying they believed Asgari soon would return to Iran.Among the US citizens held in Iran is US Navy veteran Michael White, of Imperial Beach, California. White was detained in July 2018 while visiting a girlfriend in Iran. He was convicted of insulting Iran’s supreme leader and posting private information online.He was released from prison in March on a medical furlough that required him to remain in the country in the care of the Swiss Embassy in Tehran, which represents America’s interests in Iran. White is among tens of thousands of prisoners granted medical furloughs by Iran, which was one of the first countries to be hit hard by the spread of the coronavirus.In December, Iran released a Princeton University scholar held for three years on widely disputed espionage charges in exchange for the release of a detained Iranian scientist.In March, the family of former FBI agent Robert Levinson, who vanished in Iran 13 years ago on an unauthorized CIA mission, said they had been informed by US officials that they had determined that Levinson was probably dead. They have not elaborated on how they made that determination.Westerners and Iranian dual nationals with ties to the West often find themselves tried and convicted in closed-door trials in Iran, only later to be used as bargaining chips in negotiations.The release comes as the US under President Donald Trump continues a maximum-pressure campaign targeting Iran after unilaterally withdrawing from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers in May 2018. In the time since, the two countries have seen a series of escalating incidents, including the US drone strike killing an Iranian general in Baghdad and an Iranian ballistic missile attack targeting American troops in Iraq.___Gambrell reported from Dubai, United Arab Emirates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-scientist-acquitted-in-us-trade-secrets-case-deported/story-cUPnFVCBQd4ZbSH8sJClbP.html
02-06-2020||World||Donald Trump visits historic church that was set on fire by protestors||US President Donald Trump has visited a historic church that was partially burned down in violent protests here over the custodial killing of African-American George Floyd, a day after he was forced to take shelter in a White House bunker. St. John’s church was set ablaze on Sunday night as protestors demanded justice for the killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old man who was pinned to the ground in Minneapolis last week by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath.His death triggered violent protests across the US. After the protests escalated on Sunday, the Secret Service rushed the president to an underground bunker previously used during terrorist attacks.On Monday, Trump stood in front of the boarded-up St John’s church with a Bible in his hand.“Greatest country in the world. And we’re going to keep it safe,” said the president who was accompanied by US Attorney General William Barr, Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany.Trump announced his decision to walk down to the historic park during his address to the nation from the Rose Garden of the White House.“And now I’m going to pay my respects a very, very special place,” he said. Minutes later, he was seen walking out of the main entrance of the White House with secret service lined up on both sides.Known as “the Church of the Presidents”, St. John’s Episcopal Church held its first service on October 27, 1816, and the church was consecrated on December 27, 1816.The church is at a walking distance across the White House through the Lafayette Park, which has been a hub of violent protest in Washington DC for the past few days. Beginning with James Madison, until the present, every person who has held the office of President of the United States has attended a service at St. John’s, according to the information available on its website.“The protests that began peacefully grew to something more, and eventually a fire was lit in the nursery, in the basement of Ashburton House,” Rev. Rob Fisher, church rector, wrote in a blog post.Some reports said that small groups of people began setting fires and smashing windows once darkness fell. According to local police, a small fire was deliberately set in the basement.“It’s heart-rending. This is a very historic building. A person sprayed graffiti at the church: ‘The Devil is across (the) street’,” Fisher said.Earlier, the entire Lafayette Park was cleared of protestors. The protestors were forcefully removed from the park with police using tear gas.Since Sunday, Trump’s opponents and a section of the media have been slamming him for not being seen in the public.However, Trump’s family members, close aides and supporters hailed him for leading the country from the front.“This is the guy that the media and left just spent days telling us was a coward hiding in his basement,” said his son Donald J Trump Jr as he re-tweeted a video of his father walking down the Lafayette Park from the White House to the church.The president went to the church after an address to the nation from Rose Garden of the White House.“I will fight to protect you. I am your president of law and order and an ally of all peaceful protesters,” Trump said, as he spelled out concrete steps to restore normalcy in the country which for the past seven days has experiences a spate of violent protests over the custodial killing of African-American George Floyd.“Powerful remarks by President”, said Kimberly Guilfoyle, advisor to Donald J Trump for President, Inc. and National Chair of the Trump Victory Finance Committees.“He truly is the President and leader for all Americans and he will stand up to defend both the peaceful protests, as well as the safety and security of our communities!” she said.Describing Trump as “the law and order president”, Al Mason, co-chair of the Trump Victory Indian American Finance Committee, said in a statement that Trump supports the rights of peaceful protestors, but anarchy, rioting and looting needs to end.“He has correctly called Antifa - a domestic terrorist entity. He is right in mobilising US military to end riots and lawlessness,” Mason said.Responding to questions, during her news conference, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said burning of the church was hurtful.“It’s hurtful, honestly. I think it’s hurtful on a number of levels,” she said. “That doesn’t honor the legacy of George Floyd. It doesn’t. And certainly not the burning of St. John’s Church,” she added.Considered to be the worst ever civil unrest in the US in decades, the violent protests have engulfed at least 140 cities across America in the days following the death of Floyd.Over 4,000 people have been arrested and curfews imposed in at least 40 cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-visits-historic-church-that-was-set-on-fire-by-protestors/story-3g9KUjtCdgeuIJPy2YVudM.html
02-06-2020||World||Explainer: Can you catch Covid-19 from delivered packages?||An outbreak of Covid-19 at a logistics centre run by one of South Korea’s largest online shopping companies has raised concerns over whether the virus can be transmitted by package deliveries.Who’s been infected?More than 117 cases of Covid-19 have been linked to the warehouse near Seoul owned by e-commerce giant Coupang facility. No cases have been related to deliveries and South Korean health officials have played down the chance of infection from packages.While infection from touching surfaces of boxes or bubble wraps couriered by an infected logistics centre worker would be concerning, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said transmission in this manner was unlikely.“There has been no precedent of a global transmission so far from delivered packages,” Vice Health Minister Kim Gang-lip told a briefing.But health authorities and infectious disease experts have not ruled out the possibility of infection if a person touches their eyes, nose or mouth after contact with a contaminated package.Contaminated surfacesThe World Health Organization (WHO) has cited laboratory research that found the coronavirus that causes Covid-19 could persist for up to 24 hours on cardboard and 72 hours on plastic and stainless steel.Kim Woo-joo, a professor of Infectious Diseases at Korea University Guro Hospital, said the virus could also survive on surfaces like bubble wrap.“The virus can last up to 24 hours on cardboards and over three days on hard surfaces like stainless steel. There is no research on bubble wraps yet, but it could be between a cardboard and a stainless steel,” he said.Speedy delivery dangers?Many of South Korea’s e-commerce brands are known for their less-than-24-hour “bullet delivery”. Both Coupang and Market Kurly, which have reported infections from their logistics centres, provide fast grocery delivery services.This could raise the risk of spreading the virus, as packages don’t sit for long, some experts said.“We should take into account the temperature and the humidity of the package, but there is a possibility of infection as they pack it overnight,” said Shin Hyoung-shik, president of the Korean Society for Zoonoses, a leading expert in infectious diseases.However, Ki Mo-ran, professor of cancer control and population health at the National Cancer Center, said it was not so easy to contaminate packaging, and people should be safe as long as they wash their hands.“Just a small amount of virus is not that contagious ... the handles of a public restroom could be more dangerous.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explainer-can-you-catch-covid-19-from-delivered-packages/story-Yg67EMuj9HTIBfMr1lG2CI.html
02-06-2020||World||First Rohingya refugee dies from coronavirus in Bangladesh||A 71-year-old man has become the first Rohingya living in vast refugee camps in Bangladesh to die from the coronavirus, an official said Tuesday.Health experts have long warned that the deadly virus could race through the vast network of settlements housing almost a million refugees in the country’s southeast.“He died on May 31. But last night we got the confirmation that he died of COVID-19,” said Toha Bhuiyan, a senior health official in the Cox’s Bazar district.The fatality was in Kutupalong, the largest of the camps, which is home to roughly 600,000 people.The man was among at least 29 Rohingya to have tested positive for the virus in the camps.Bhuiyan said the victim died in an isolation centre run by the medical charity Doctors Without Borders and was buried in the camp the same day. “We are going to speak to administrators in the camp and alert people about the death,” Bhuiyan said, adding they were trying to find people the deceased had been in contact with.Mahbubur Rahman, head of the health department in Cox’s Bazar district, told AFP officials were waiting for a full report on the death.A UN spokesperson said they would comment later.More than 740,000 Rohingya fled a brutal 2017 military crackdown in Myanmar to Cox’s Bazar, where around 200,000 refugees were already living.In early April authorities imposed a complete lockdown on the district -- home to 3.4 million people including the refugees -- after a number of infections were recorded.The first cases in the camps were detected in mid-May.Officials have since blocked roads leading to several areas of the camps where most of the infections have been recorded.Last week about 15,000 refugees were placed in quarantine as the number of cases increased. Bangladesh and UN authorities have prepared seven isolation centres with the capacity to treat more than 700 patients inside the camps.Aid workers say many of the refugees know very little about the virus.They blame this partly on local authorities cutting off access to the internet in September to combat what they said were drug traffickers and other criminals.Bangladesh has also seen a sharp rise in coronavirus infections in recent weeks, with more than 60,000 cases and around 700 deaths.Despite this the country lifted its coronavirus lockdown on Sunday, with millions heading back to work in densely populated cities and towns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-rohingya-refugee-dies-from-coronavirus-in-bangladesh/story-02Ak42RbOwmLzkMn0SiIZO.html
02-06-2020||World||Former US President Obama condemns violence at protests||Former US President Barack Obama on Monday condemned the use of violence at nationwide protests over racial inequities and excessive police force, while praising the actions of peaceful protesters seeking change. The vast majority of protesters have been peaceful, but a “small minority” were putting people at risk and harming the very communities the protests are intended to help, Obama wrote in an online essay posted on Medium. Obama, a Democrat who served two terms as president prior to Republican Donald Trump’s administration, said the violence was “compounding the destruction of neighborhoods that are often already short on services and investment and detracting from the larger cause.”The United States has been rocked by six straight nights of tumult over the death last week of a black man in Minneapolis, George Floyd, after a white police officer pinned him to the ground by kneeling on his neck.Obama’s latest remarks came three days after his first comments on the Floyd case, which called for justice but did not mention the violent nature of some protests. His shift in tone on Monday came as some protesters have set fires, smashed windows and looted stores, forcing mayors in large cities to impose nighttime curfews.On Sunday, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden, who served as Obama’s vice president and will face Trump in the Nov. 3 election, also called for an end to the violence. “Protesting such brutality is right and necessary,” Biden said in a statement. “But burning down communities and needless destruction is not.”Obama, who remains perhaps the most popular figure in the Democratic Party, endorsed Biden for president in April and has said he will campaign for him in the months ahead. Largely avoiding politics since he left office in 2017, Obama recently has been critical of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. As the first black US president, Obama dealt with civil unrest in cities such as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, where there were widespread, sometimes violent, protests over the deaths of young black men at the hands of the police. In both cases, Obama was critical of the violence, saying they hindered efforts to curb police misconduct. In 2015, during the Baltimore protests, he blasted “the criminals and thugs who tore up the place.”Obama’s Justice Department launched probes into police departments in those cities and others such as Chicago in an effort to bring about internal reforms, a practice the Trump administration has employed much less frequently.In his Medium essay, Obama urged protesters not to be cynical about politics, arguing that electing new leaders on the national and local levels would bring about change. “Eventually, aspirations have to be translated into specific laws and institutional practices — and in a democracy, that only happens when we elect government officials who are responsive to our demands,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-president-obama-condemns-violence-at-protests/story-OLcWB3Wv62q7MKhXUtSvoM.html
02-06-2020||World||World’s latest billionaire emerges from costly divorce in Asia||A new female billionaire has emerged from one of Asia’s most-expensive breakups.Du Weimin, the chairman of Shenzhen Kangtai Biological Products Co., transferred 161.3 million shares of the vaccine maker to his ex-wife, Yuan Liping, according to a May 29 filing, immediately catapulting her into the ranks of the world’s richest.The stock was worth $3.2 billion as of Monday’s close.Yuan, 49 this year, owns the shares directly, but signed an agreement delegating the voting rights to her ex-husband, the filing shows. The Canadian citizen, who resides in Shenzhen, served as a director of Kangtai between May 2011 and August 2018. She’s now the vice general manager of subsidiary Beijing Minhai Biotechnology Co. Yuan holds a bachelor’s degree in economics from Beijing’s University of International Business and Economics.Kangtai shares have more than doubled in the past year and have continued their ascent since February, when the company announced a plan to develop a vaccine to fight the coronavirus. They slipped for a second day Tuesday following news of the divorce terms, losing 3.1% as of 9:43 a.m. in Hong Kong and bringing the company’s market value to $12.9 billion.Du’s net worth has now dropped to about $3.1 billion from $6.5 billion before the split, excluding his pledged shares.The 56-year-old was born into a farming family in China’s Jiangxi province. After studying chemistry in college, he began working in a clinic in 1987 and became a sales manager for a biotech company in 1995, according to the prospectus of Kangtai’s 2017 initial public offering. In 2009, Kangtai acquired Minhai, the company Du founded in 2004, and he became the chairman of the combined entity.China’s rapidly growing economy has been an engine for the country’s richest, and Du is not the only tycoon who’s had to pay a steep price for a divorce. In 2012, Wu Yajun, at one point the nation’s richest woman, transferred a stake worth about $2.3 billion to her ex-husband, Cai Kui, who co-founded developer Longfor Group Holdings Ltd. In 2016, tech billionaire Zhou Yahui gave $1.1 billion of shares in his online gaming company, Beijing Kunlun Tech Co., to ex-wife Li Qiong after a civil court settlement.Sometimes, a goodbye can be time-consuming too. South Korean tycoon Chey Tae-won’s wife filed a lawsuit in December asking for a 42.3% stake in SK Holdings Co. valued at $1.2 billion. That would make her the second-largest shareholder of the company should she win the case, which is still ongoing.The most expensive divorce in history is that of Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos. The Amazon.com Inc. founder gave 4% of the online retailer to Mackenzie, who now has a $48 billion fortune and is the world’s fourth-richest woman.(Updates Tuesday move in fifth paragraph)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-s-latest-billionaire-emerges-from-costly-divorce-in-asia/story-L2Ft9NrGWGBWoKNsTKZH6I.html

Governor Andrew Cuomo and Mayor de Blasio announced on Monday that the citywide curfew in New York City will begin at 11 PM on Monday and will be lifted at 5 AM Tuesday morning.They also announced that the New York City Police Department will double its presence, bringing nearly 8000 police personnel to help prevent violence and damage to property, in angry response to the killing of Floyd, a 46-year-old man who was pinned to the ground in Minneapolis last week by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath. The additional officers will be deployed in areas where violence broke out and property was damage during the previous night’s protests - specifically in lower Manhattan and Downtown Brooklyn.Videos and photos posted on social media showed that while demonstrators protested peacefully around most areas in the city, there were several instances of looting as well.Also read: George Floyd died of ‘neck compression’, says medical examinerPeople were seen breaking into high end stores around Manhattan’s Madison Avenue and Fifth Avenue, home to almost all luxury and high-end brands from around the world, and running way with merchandise from the shops. Groups of people also looted pharmacies, electronic stores and other businesses across the city.Governor Cuomo said that the curfew was imposed is to help separate the overwhelming majority of peaceful protesters from “people who are looking to exploit the moment by looting”. “New York City, they looted high end stores with high end merchandise. That wasn’t a coincidence. There were people who knew what they were doing. If you wanted to commit a crime…that was the time and night to do it, right?” he told CNN. Cuomo said while there are “extremist groups that just want to propose anarchy”, the majority of the people are making a very valid point that discrimination and abuse by police should finally end.The governor said in a statement that while the state authorities encourage people to protest peacefully and make their voices heard, the safety of the general public was paramount and cannot be compromised. “I stand behind the protestors and their message, but unfortunately there are people who are looking to distract and discredit this moment. The violence and the looting has been bad for the city, the state and this entire national movement, undermining and distracting from this righteous cause,” Cuomo said.He also criticised President Donald Trump for threatening to call in the military to end protests around the country.“What the president today did was he called out the American military against American citizens. That’s what they did. They used the American military to push back a peaceful protest, which everyone watched on TV, just so he could have a photo-op of walking to a church. When was the last time you saw the American military called out against Americans?,” he said. Trump, who was taken to an underground bunker in the White House on Friday as protesters gathered outside the presidential residence, on Monday ventured outside the White House grounds to pose for photographs at a nearby church. Before Trump came out of the White House, riot police and National Guard troops used tear gas and flash grenades to disperse a peaceful protest in a nearby park. Mayor Blasio said he supported peaceful protest in the city.The mayor said while demonstrations have been generally peaceful, “we can’t let violence undermine the message of this moment. It is too important and the message must be heard”. He said there had been incidents over the past few days, as the protests intensified, where police officers did not uphold the values of New York City or of the Police Department. “We agree on the need for swift action,” he said, adding that it will be ensured that such officers are held accountable. Considered to be the worst ever civil unrest in the US in decades, the violent protests have engulfed at least 140 cities across America in the days following the death of Floyd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/curfew-imposed-in-nyc-as-protesters-loot-stores-across-manhattan/story-XGKwDhlITtNbK1MFc4A4lL.html
02-06-2020||World||Louisville police chief fired over death of restaurant owner David McAtee||Riot police firing tear gas scattered a protest crowd from a downtown Louisville square Monday night, hours after the firing of the city’s police chief in the uproar over the early morning shooting death of a popular restaurant owner by security forces.David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue spot who was known for offering meals to police officers, died while police and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew early Monday amid waves of protests over a previous police shooting in Kentucky’s largest city. Police said they were responding to gunfire from a crowd.Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer announced the firing of Police Chief Steve Conrad at a news conference Monday. He said officers involved in the shooting failed to activate body cameras at the chaotic scene. Authorities had sought footage for their investigation, after Kentucky’s governor demanded the release of police video.“This type of institutional failure will not be tolerated,” Fischer said. “Accordingly, I have relieved Steve Conrad of his duties as chief of Louisville Metro Police Department.”Gov. Andy Beshear later called the lack of body camera footage unacceptable.“This is the entire reason that we have those cameras,” the Democratic governor said at the state Capitol in Frankfort.Beshear authorized state police to independently investigate, promising the probe will be conducted in an “honest and transparent way that will not take months.”US Attorney Russell Coleman announced that federal authorities will be part of the investigation.The governor said he had counted on body camera footage to help determine “the truth in a way that spoke for itself, at a time when trust is difficult and people deserve to be able to see and evaluate.”Late Monday afternoon, a huge group stretching several city blocks marched peacefully from downtown Louisville to the spot where McAtee was shot. Some motorists honked horns and raised fists in solidarity.Hundreds of protesters regrouped later Monday night at downtown Jefferson Square and riot police standing shoulder to shoulder advanced amid burts of fired tear gas, dispersing the crowd. Military-style vehicles could later be seen occupying the emptied-out square.The shakeup at the top of the city’s police department came a month earlier than expected. Conrad had previously announced his resignation, which was to take effect at the end of June. Deputy Chief Robert Schroeder will step in immediately as chief, Fischer said.The mayor also said the city’s curfew was being extended until June 8.Police did retrieve video from crime center cameras that showed how the shooting unfolded, Schroeder said.Two Louisville officers and two Guard soldiers returned fire, he said. The two officers violated policy by not wearing or activating body cameras, Schroeder said, adding they have been placed on administrative leave.McAtee, whose YaYa’s BBQ Shack is near where the shooting occurred, was mourned by hundreds.Christopher 2X, an anti-violence activist and executive director of the group Game Changers, said McAtee was well-liked.“I’ve never known him to be aggressive in any kind of way,” he said.Schroeder agreed that McAtee was friendly to police officers. “Over the years he’s been a good friend to the police officers ... frequently making sure our officers had a good meal on their shifts,” he said.Before his dismissal, Conrad confirmed the shooting happened around 12:15 a.m. Monday outside a food market on West Broadway, where police and the National Guard had been called to break up a group of curfew violators.Someone fired a shot at law enforcement officials, and both soldiers and officers returned fire, he said. Several “persons of interest” were being interviewed, he said.News outlets showed video taken by someone in a car parked at a gas station. It recorded the sound of bullets being fired as groups of police and Guard soldiers crouched behind cars.Kris Smith said he was at a restaurant — “just outside having a good time, having drinks, eating barbecue” — when the soldiers arrived.“As soon as I walk to my car they jump out with the sticks, the police jump out with their sticks and their shields and stuff on,” Smith said. “It looked like something out of a movie. It looked like a freaking war zone.”He said he heard a loud noise, then gunfire minutes later.Smith, who is black, said the group had nothing to do with the protests.Protesters have been demanding justice for Breonna Taylor, a black woman killed in her home in Louisville in March. The 26-year-old EMT was shot eight times by narcotics detectives who knocked down her front door as they attempted to enforce a search warrant. No drugs were found in the home.After Taylor’s death, the mayor said Louisville police would be required to wear body cameras.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/louisville-police-chief-fired-over-death-of-restaurant-owner-david-mcatee/story-MmEbjOr2mzhJtDwJwtVkOP.html
02-06-2020||World||UN Security Council elections to be held on June 17||Elections for five non-permanent members of the UN Security Council will be held on June 17, according to the world body’s provisional programme.The programme was released on Monday as France took over the Presidency of the 15-nation Council for the month of June. According to the informal provisional programme of work of the Security Council for this month, Security Council elections are scheduled for June 17. India is a candidate for a non-permanent seat from the Asia-Pacific category for the 2021-22 term. Its victory is given since it is the sole candidate vying for the lone seat from the grouping. New Delhi’s candidature was unanimously endorsed by the 55-member Asia-Pacific grouping, including China and Pakistan, in June last year.The General Assembly last week adopted a decision to hold the Security Council elections under new voting arrangements taking into account restrictions in place due to the Covid-19 pandemic. From India’s perspective, any change in how the voting is conducted will not impact much since it is the sole candidate from the Asia Pacific region and its term starts only in January 2021.The UNSC elections are held in the General Assembly hall with each of the 193 member states casting its vote in a secret ballot. However, large in-person meetings at the world body’s headquarters stand postponed due to the Covid-19 pandemic till end of June. Under the new voting arrangement, President of the General Assembly Tijjani Muhammad-Bande will circulate a letter to all Member States at least 10 working days prior to the first round of secret balloting for the elections, informing them of the date on which the elections will be held, the number of vacant seats, the venue where ballots may be cast and other logistical details.On the day of the elections, the voter will be required to visit the designated venue during a specific time slot to cast its ballots. Only ballots cast in the ballot boxes at the designated venue will be accepted and no ballots would be accepted after the last time slot has expired.If the total number of ballot papers cast in all the ballot boxes do not amount to at least a majority of the members of the Assembly, the President would circulate a letter to all Member States indicating a new date and time for the elections. The General Assembly President will circulate a letter to all Member States informing them of the results once the voting is complete and the ballots counted. Canada, Ireland and Norway are vying for two seats in the Western Europe and Other countries category, Mexico is the only candidate for the one Latin America and Caribbean seat and Kenya and Djibouti will contest the seat available for the African group.Previously, India has been elected as a non-permanent member of the Council for the years 1950—1951, 1967—1968, 1972—1973, 1977—1978, 1984—1985, 1991—1992 and most recently in 2011—2012. India has been at the forefront of the years-long efforts to reform the Security Council saying it rightly deserves a place as a permanent member of the Council, which in its current form does not represent the geo-political realities of the 21st Century.Each year the General Assembly elects five non-permanent members (out of 10 in total) for a two-year term. The 10 non-permanent seats are distributed on a regional basis - five for African and Asian States; one for Eastern European States; two for the Latin American and Caribbean States; and two for Western European and other States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-security-council-elections-to-be-held-on-june-17/story-wUyB4LNbRVSDuD94skQiNM.html

WHO said it already had teams on the ground.Covid-19 already has touched seven of Congo’s 25 provinces, with more than 3,000 confirmed cases and 72 deaths. However, like many African countries Congo has conducted extremely limited testing, and observers fear the true toll may be far higher.“This quadruple threat could prove lethal for millions of children and their families,” said Anne-Marie Connor, national director in Congo for the aid organization World Vision.According to WHO, new outbreaks of Ebola are expected in the Democratic Republic of the Congo given the existence of the virus in an animal reservoir in many parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ebola-strikes-congo-again-who-says-covid-19-not-the-only-health-threat/story-DS3Ma0PWGDHAlOBSMMFz2N.html

At least one appeared to go under the vehicle’s wheels.The SUV drove around an armored vehicle and sped off as more gunfire sounded.The officers were taken to Erie County Medical Center. Authorities said their condition was stable.Erie County Executive Mark Poloncarz tweeted shortly before 11 p.m. that the driver and passengers of the vehicle were believed to be in custody.Buffalo Police spokesman Michael DeGeorge said two people were struck by gunfire during Monday’s protest. It was not immediately known whether the shots came from police or others, he said. They were being treated at the same hospital.As a police helicopter flew overhead, officers in armored vehicles later fired tear gas to disperse the crowd within a few blocks of where the police were struck. Several stores in the area were broken into, and people were seen entering and leaving with goods.One woman on her front stoop said, “I’m scared,” to a person over phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suv-hits-2-officers-at-floyd-protest-in-buffalo-speeds-off/story-qXvoPaT2MGjUVdfcXuAEKI.html
02-06-2020||World||Few Black CEOs from US are speaking out on killings, protests||Some of the country’s most prominent black corporate leaders are weighing in publicly on the protests gripping the US, drawing from their own personal histories as they call for unity and seek to reassure employees.The chief executive officers from companies including Tapestry Inc. and Merck & Co. are hardly the first prominent executives to comment on the topic. But by calling attention to their own backgrounds and relating painful experiences of discrimination, they are adding their voices to corporate America’s call for unity and calm.Jide Zeitlin, the CEO of Coach and Kate Spade owner Tapestry, wrote of his own personal experiences dating back to his early-20s in a posting on the LinkedIn website. He recalled flying to a racially divided South Africa after business school to advocate for disenfranchised black miners. Within a week of his arrival, he had his first contact with tear gas and rubber bullets. The lessons, he wrote, have lasted a lifetime.“We can replace our windows and handbags, but we cannot bring back George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, Eric Garner, Trayvon Martin, Emmett Till, and too many others,” Zeitlin wrote. “Each of these black lives matter.”Merck & Co.’s Ken Frazier said in an interview on CNBC that the protests were sparked by public officials’ delayed response to the killing of George Floyd by police officers in Minneapolis on May 25.“What the African American community sees in that video tape, is that this African-American man, who could be me or any other African-American man, is being treated as less than human,” Frazier said, adding that it took four days for an arrest to be made.‘Inhumane Treatment’“What the community saw, was -- until they went out into the streets -- this officer, much less the other officers, was not going to be arrested for what was clearly inhumane treatment of a citizen,” he said.Lowe’s Cos. CEO Marvin Ellison wrote about growing up in the segregated South and the systemic oppression of the racial caste system his family was subjected to. He called for unity against racism and hate.“I have a personal understanding of the fear and frustration that many of you are feeling,” Ellison wrote in a post on Twitter. “To overcome the challenges that we all face, we must use our voices and demand that ignorance and racism must come to an end.”The small number of black voices weighing in from the top of U.S. companies draws attention to the reality that only about 1% of CEOs in the S&P 500 Index are black and progress has been mostly stalled for the last several years.In the S&P 500, African-American directors also made up only about 1% of board members, and 37% of boards didn’t have a single black member, according to an analysis last year by Black Enterprise magazine.Black voices also don’t appear to be gaining ground at the top of companies. Fewer than 10% of senior executives in so-called “profit and loss jobs,” or those that operate units, at the largest U.S. companies are black, according to an analysis late last year by executive recruiter Korn Ferry. The study was conducted for the Executive Leadership Council, which advocates for the promotion of African-American executives into the top executive ranks and boardrooms.“At some point the C-Level Suite is where you get to if you have certain experience and talents,” said Karen Boykin-Towns, vice chairman of the NAACP national board of directors and a senior counselor at public relations firm Sard Verbinnen & Co. “Not everyone can be CEO, for sure, but why is it that this crop of people, who consistently perform, aren’t given the opportunity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/few-black-ceos-from-us-are-speaking-out-on-killings-protests/story-MKubr93X99ilHqUqi4VljN.html
02-06-2020||World||China delayed releasing coronavirus info, frustrating WHO||Throughout January, the World Health Organization publicly praised China for what it called a speedy response to the new coronavirus and thanked the Chinese government for sharing the genetic map of the virus “immediately,.”But in fact, Chinese officials sat on releasing the genetic map, or genome, of the deadly virus for over a week after multiple government labs had fully decoded it, not sharing details key to designing tests, drugs and vaccines. Strict controls on information and competition within the Chinese public health system were largely to blame, The Associated Press has found from internal documents, emails and dozens of interviews.Health officials only released the genome after a Chinese lab published it ahead of authorities on a virology website on Jan 11. Even then, China stalled for at least two weeks more on giving WHO the details it needed, according to recordings of multiple internal meetings held by the UN health agency in January — all at a time when the outbreak arguably might have been dramatically slowed.Although WHO continued to publicly commend China, the recordings obtained by the AP show they were concerned China was not sharing enough information to assess the risk posed by the new virus, costing the world valuable time.“We’re currently at the stage where yes, they’re giving it to us 15 minutes before it appears on CCTV,” said WHO’s top official in China, Dr. Gauden Galea, referring to the state-owned China Central Television, in one meeting.The story behind the early response to the pandemic comes at a time when the UN health agency is under siege. US President Trump cut ties with WHO on Friday, after blasting the agency for allegedly colluding with China to hide the extent of the epidemic. Chinese President Xi Jinping said China has always provided information to WHO and the world “in a most timely fashion.”The new information does not support the narrative of either the US or China, but portrays an agency now stuck in the middle that was urgently trying to solicit more data. Although international law obliges countries to report information to WHO that could have an impact on public health, the UN agency has no enforcement powers. Instead, it must rely on the cooperation of member states.The AP has found rather than colluding with China, WHO was itself largely kept in the dark, as China gave it only the minimal information required. But the agency did attempt to portray China in the best light, most likely to coax the country into providing more outbreak details.WHO officials worried about how to press China for more information without angering authorities or jeopardizing Chinese scientists, whom they praised for decoding the genome with astonishing speed. Dr. Michael Ryan, WHO’s emergencies chief, said the best way to “protect China” was for WHO to do its own independent analysis, because otherwise the spread of the virus between people would be in question and “other countries will take action accordingly.”From the time the virus was first decoded on Jan. 2 to when WHO declared a global emergency on Jan. 30, the outbreak grew by a factor of 100 to 200 times, according to retrospective Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention data.WHO and officials named in this story declined to answer questions asked by the AP without audio or written transcripts of the recorded meetings, which the AP was unable to supply to protect its sources.“Our leadership and staff have worked night and day….to support and share information with all Member States equally, and engage in frank and forthright conversations with governments at all levels,” a WHO statement said.China’s National Health Commission and Ministry of Foreign Affairs had no comment. But in the past few months, China has repeatedly defended its actions, and many other countries — including the US — have responded to the virus with even longer delays of weeks and even months.In late December, doctors noticed mysterious clusters of patients with unusual pneumonia. Seeking answers, they sent samples to commercial labs. By Dec. 27, one company, Vision Medicals, had pieced together most of the genome of a new virus with striking similarities to SARS. They alerted Wuhan officials, who, days later, issued internal notices warning of the unusual pneumonia.On Dec. 30, Shi Zhengli, a renowned coronavirus expert at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, was alerted to the disease, and by Jan. 2, her team had fully decoded it.But when it came to sharing the genome with the world, things went awry. China’s top medical authority, the National Health Commission, issued a confidential notice forbidding labs from publishing about the virus without authorization. The order barred Shi’s lab from publishing the sequence or warning of the possible danger.Commission officials later said the order was to prevent any accidental release of the then-unknown pathogen, and to ensure consistent results by giving it to four state labs to identify at the same time.By Jan. 5, two other government labs sequenced the virus, and another lab in Shanghai led by Zhang Yongzhen had also decoded it. Zhang warned the National Health Commission the virus was “likely infectious.” The Chinese CDC raised its emergency level to the second highest, but did not have the authority to alert the public.Suspicious cases starting surfacing across the region. In Thailand, airport officials pulled aside a woman traveling from Wuhan with a runny nose, sore throat and high temperature. Scientists at Chulalongkorn University soon figured out she was infected with a new coronavirus, but did not have a sequence from China to match it.WHO officials, meanwhile, grumbled in internal meetings that China was stalling on providing crucial outbreak details even though it was technically meeting its obligations under international law. Ryan, WHO’s emergencies chief, said it was time to “shift gears” and push for more information.“The danger now is that despite our good intent...there will be a lot of finger-pointing at WHO if something does happen,” he said.On Jan. 11, Shanghai’s Zhang finally published the coronavirus sequence ahead of health authorities on virological.org, used by researchers to swap tips on pathogens. It was only then that the Chinese CDC, Wuhan Institute of Virology and the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences raced to publish their sequences, doing so on Jan. 12.On Jan. 20, Chinese authorities warned the virus spread between people. WHO dispatched a small team to Wuhan from its Asia offices. China representative Galea told colleagues the Chinese were “talking openly and consistently about human-to-human transmission.”WHO’s emergency committee of independent experts met twice that week and decided against recommending an emergency. But the agency’s concern prompted an unusual trip to Beijing by WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus and top scientists.At the end of Tedros’ trip, WHO convened another emergency meeting, finally declaring a global emergency on Jan. 30. Tedros thanked China profusely, declining to mention any of WHO’s earlier frustrations.“We should have actually expressed our respect and gratitude to China for what it’s doing,” he said. “It has already done incredible things to limit the transmission of the virus to other countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-delayed-releasing-coronavirus-info-frustrating-who/story-iLlrOe2Ad876sikBmOzRmK.html
02-06-2020||World||Hong Kong’s leader decries US ‘double standards’ over protests||Hong Kong’s leader blasted the US for “double standards” in the way it handles protests after the Trump administration vocally supported sometimes-violent demonstrations in the Asian financial hub.“Look at how the local governments handle chaos in the US and what stance they took on a similar level of chaos in Hong Kong last year,” Chief Executive Carrie Lam said at a weekly news briefing Tuesday. “They are highly concerned about their national security, while holding different standards for our country, especially over Hong Kong’s situation.”Lam’s government is facing renewed anti-government protests as China’s plan to enact sweeping national security legislation over the city fuels public anger. President Donald Trump vowed to revoke some of the city’s special trading privileges and impose sanctions against Chinese and Hong Kong officials “directly or indirectly involved” in eroding the city’s autonomy.The US, which has passed bipartisan legislation backing Hong Kong’s pro-democracy camp, now finds itself engulfed by widespread unrest of its own, triggered by the death of African-American man George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis.Also read: Police fire rubber bullets, tear gas to disperse peaceful protest near White HouseLam’s backers in Beijing have seized the opportunity to needle the Trump administration over the protests in recent days, with Chinese propaganda outlets showing scenes from the US of burning buildings, harsh police responses and demonstrators decrying the government.China Trolls US Over Protests After Trump Criticized Hong KongLam on Tuesday addressed the possibility of US sanctions, saying there was “no justification whatsoever” for any foreign governments to level them on Hong Kong.“For the time being, I have not seen or heard any details from the US administration,” she said. “My stance is to point out to the American government, and any other governments if that arises, is that they will be hurting their own interests in Hong Kong,” she added.Vigil BannedEarlier this week, Hong Kong’s police for the first time banned people from gathering June 4 to commemorate the 1989 crackdown on activists in Beijing’s Tiananmen Square, a day that has typically been a flashpoint for protests. In anticipation of the order, the organizer said Sunday that it planned to conduct the event online.June 4 coincides with the final day that the Hong Kong government is enforcing social-distancing rules -- unless there are any extensions -- that bar gatherings of more than eight people. Officials have denied that the Tiananmen vigil had anything to do with the timing of the rules.Lam said Hong Kong was cautious about further relaxing coronavirus-related social distancing measures after the discovery of a cluster of new virus cases spread within the community, and that it would make announcements on the issue as soon as possible, without giving further details. The city has seen relative success in containing the spread of the pandemic, and has slowly returned to a sense of normalcy in recent weeks.But as parts of the world begin reopening after virus-induced closures, Lam cautioned that governments shouldn’t take measures that would further undermine the global economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-s-leader-decries-us-double-standards-over-protests/story-V7Nqq1XzYf9moTrA0UnMbO.html

Indraprastha Gas Ltd (IGL), the firm that retails CNG to automobiles and piped natural gas to household kitchens, revised CNG price in the national capital “from Rs 42/ kg to Rs 43/ kg, w.e.f. 6 am on 2nd June 2020,” the firm tweeted. There will, however, be no change in piped cooking gas prices. The company had last cut CNG price by Rs 3.2 per kg and piped natural gas rate by Rs 1.55 per unit from April 3. The nationwide lockdown imposed from March 25 saw fuel sales drop by as much as 90 per cent but relaxations thereafter have not helped demand recover to pre-COVID levels. Despite the drop in sales, the company continued to incur expenditure on paying salaries, fixed charges for power connections, maintenance of equipment and rent, sources said. To recover these charges, the firm has raised CNG prices, they said. “CNG retail price in Noida, Greater Noida & Ghaziabad being revised from Rs 47.75/ kg to Rs 48.75/ kg, w.e.f. 6 am on 2nd June 2020,” IGL said in another tweet.

02-06-2020||World||Police fire rubber bullets, tear gas to disperse peaceful protest near White House||Police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse peaceful demonstrators near the White House on Monday as U.S. President Donald Trump vowed a massive show of force to end violent protests over the death of a black man in police custody. Law enforcement, including officers on horseback, moved on protesters in Lafayette Park, across the street from the White House as Trump made his remarks from the Rose Garden.The president pledged to end six nights of looting and violence in major cities across the nation “now,” saying he would deploy the U.S. military if state governors refused to call out the National Guard. “Mayors and governors must establish an overwhelming law enforcement presence until the violence has been quelled,” Trump said. “If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them.”The police action against protesters cleared the way for Trump to walk from the White House to nearby St. John’s Episcopal Church along with other officials including U.S. Attorney General William Barr. Trump posed for photos at the church, which suffered minor damage the night before, holding up a Bible.The security forces that moved against protesters at the White House included National Guard military police, Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security police as well as District of Columbia police. Just a few hours later, thousands of people marched through the streets of Brooklyn, shouting “justice now!” while cars drove alongside, some drivers honking in support while police vans followed.A smaller march took place in Hollywood, where protesters defied a curfew imposed by Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti to march to a line of police, where they knelt down with their arms raised.‘MECHANICAL ASPHYXIATION’Anti-police brutality marches and rallies, which have turned violent after dark each night over the last week, erupted over the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old African American who died in Minneapolis police custody after being pinned beneath a white officer’s knee for nearly nine minutes.A second autopsy ordered by Floyd’s family and released on Monday found that his death was a homicide by “mechanical asphyxiation,” meaning that physical force interfered with his oxygen supply. The report says three officers contributed to Floyd’s death. The Hennepin County Medical Examiner then released details of its autopsy findings that also said Floyd’s death was a homicide caused by asphyxiation. The county report added that Floyd suffered cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by police and that he had arteriosclerotic and hypertensive heart disease, fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use.Derek Chauvin, the 44-year-old Minneapolis police officer who kneeled on Floyd, was arrested on third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter charges. Three other officers involved in the arrest have not been charged. Floyd’s death was the latest case of police brutality against black men caught on videotape and prompting an outcry over racism in U.S. law enforcement. It reignited simmering racial tensions in a politically divided country that has been hit hard by the pandemic, with African Americans accounting for a disproportionately high number of cases. Dozens of cities across the United States remain under curfews not seen since riots after the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. The National Guard deployed in 23 states and Washington, D.C.The curfews were imposed as most Americans were still emerging from weeks of strict “stay-at-home” orders imposed in the face of the coronavirus pandemic.On Monday, dozens of people paid their respects to Floyd outside Cup Foods, the scene of his death, leaving flowers and signs. A little girl wrote, “I’ll fight with you,” in aqua blue chalk in the road.“This is therapeutic. My heart was real heavy this morning so I came down extra early and when I got here, the heaviness lifted,” said Diana Jones, 40, the mother of four children. “This right here let’s me know that things are going to be OK.”Terrence Floyd, the victim’s brother, told the gathering he wanted people to get educated and vote rather than resort to violence and destruction. “Let’s do this another way,” he said. Trump, a Republican, has condemned the killing of Floyd and promised justice but has described protesters as “thugs.” Opponents accuse him of stoking conflict and racial tension when he should be uniting the nation and addressing underlying issues, and his campaign-style appearance at St. John’s Church sparked criticism.“I am outraged,” Bishop Mariann Edgar Budde of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington, which includes the church, said on CNN. Trump’s message was antithetical to church teachings, she said. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo criticized the use of force against demonstrators to make way for Trump to hold the picture-taking opportunity. “It was really, truly shameful,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-fire-rubber-bullets-tear-gas-to-disperse-peaceful-protest-near-white-house/story-X6cTooB49CrOEwaURw4WdJ.html
02-06-2020||World||George Floyd died of ‘neck compression’, says medical examiner||A medical examiner on Monday classified George Floyd’s death as a homicide, saying his heart stopped as police restrained him and compressed his neck, in a widely seen video that has sparked protests across the nation.“Decedent experienced a cardiopulmonary arrest while being restrained by law enforcement officer(s),” the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office said in a news release. Cause of death was listed as “cardiopulmonary arrest complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.”Under “other significant conditions” it said Floyd suffered from heart disease and hypertension, and listed fentanyl intoxication and recent methamphetamine use. Those factors were not listed under cause of death.A Minneapolis police officer was charged last week with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed the officer, Derek Chauvin, holding his knee on Floyd’s neck despite the man’s cries that he can’t breathe until he eventually stopped moving.A separate autopsy commissioned for Floyd’s family also called his death a homicide. It concluded that that he died of asphyxiation due to neck and back compression, said the family’s attorney, Ben Crump, who called for the charge against Chauvin to be upgraded to first-degree murder and for three other officers to be charged. He didn’t say what the charges against the other officers should be.That autopsy, by a forensic pathologist who also examined Eric Garner’s body, found the compression cut off blood to Floyd’s brain, and that the pressure of other officers’ knees on his back made it impossible for him to breathe, Crump said.Both the medical examiner and the family’s experts differed from the description in last week’s criminal complaint against the officer of how Floyd died. The complaint, citing preliminary findings from the medical examiner, listed the effects of being restrained, along with underlying health issues and potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system. But it also said nothing was found “to support a diagnosis of traumatic asphyxia or strangulation.” Neither side has released its full autopsy report so far.The family’s autopsy found no evidence of heart disease and concluded he had been healthy.Floyd, a black man who was in handcuffs at the time, died after Chauvin, who is white, ignored bystander shouts to get off Floyd and Floyd’s cries that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked days of protests in Minneapolis and around America.The complaint provided no details about intoxicants. In the 911 call that drew police, the caller described the man suspected of paying with counterfeit money as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.”Floyd’s family and attorneys, like the families of other black men killed by police, commissioned their own autopsy because they didn’t trust local authorities to produce an unbiased report.The family’s autopsy was done by Michael Baden and Allecia Wilson. Baden is the former chief medical examiner of New York City, and was hired to do an autopsy of Garner, a black man who died in 2014 after New York police placed him in a chokehold and he pleaded that he could not breathe.Baden also did an autopsy at the family’s request for Michael Brown, an 18-year-old shot by police in Ferguson, Missouri. He said Brown didn’t reveal signs of a struggle, casting doubt on a claim by police that a struggle between Brown and the officer led to the shooting.Dr. Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist from the San Francisco Bay area who blogs about the subject and is not connected with the case, said the key difference between the medical examiner’s conclusions and those of Baden and Walker are the official finding of “significant” conditions for Floyd, including heart disease and drugs in his system.Baden and Wilson acknowledged on a conference call with reporters that they didn’t have access to the tissue samples that the medical examiner kept that might have given more information on his health. Nor did they have their own toxicology results yet.Melinek said it’s not unusual for different pathologists to reach different determinations, given that they may be looking at different information and that they’ve had different experiences and training.Under the law, a medical examiner determines the cause and manner of death, but it’s up to prosecutors to decide whether criminal charges are warranted. The term homicide means only that a person’s death was caused by another person.Chauvin, who was also charged with manslaughter, is being held in a state prison. The other three officers on scene, like Chauvin, were fired the day after the incident but have not been charged.The head of the Minneapolis police union said in a letter to members that the officers were fired without due process and labor attorneys are fighting for their jobs. Lt. Bob Kroll, the union president, also criticized city leadership, saying a lack of support is to blame for the days of sometimes violent protests.When asked to respond, Mayor Jacob Frey said Kroll’s opposition to reform and lack of empathy for the community has undermined trust in the police.Gov. Tim Walz announced Sunday that Attorney General Keith Ellison would take the lead in any prosecutions in Floyd’s death. Local civil rights activists have said Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman doesn’t have the trust of the black community. They have protested outside his house, and pressed him to charge the other three officers.Freeman remains on the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floyd-s-heart-stopped-while-restrained-says-medical-examiner/story-G7ExB6oEb38L4pEeBkQkbO.html
02-06-2020||World||South America ignores Europe and reopens as virus peak nears||South American countries on Monday began easing COVID-19 restrictions even as the region hurtles toward its viral peak, disregarding the example set by European nations that were battered earlier by the virus.Some of Brazil’s hardest hit cities, including the jungle metropolis Manaus and coastal Rio de Janeiro, are starting to allow more activity. Bolivia’s government authorized reopening most of the country and the government of Venezuela’s Nicolás Maduro unwound restrictions. Ecuador’s airports were resuming flights and shoppers returning to some of Colombia’s malls.Rolling back measures runs counter to Europe’s approach of waiting for the worst to pass before resuming activity, and South America trails much further behind on its viral curve. Even European nations that lifted restrictions earliest in their respective outbreaks – the U.K. and Russia - did so only after clearing their initial peaks.The executive director of the World Health Organization’s emergencies program, Mike Ryan, expressed concern over South America’s climbing contagion, telling reporters Monday that the region had become an “intense zone of transmission for this virus,” which had not yet reached its peak.“Clearly the situation in many South American countries is far from stable. There is a rapid increase in cases and those systems are coming under increasing pressure,” he said.Data from the WHO’s Pan American Health Organisation shows the region’s seven-day rolling average of new cases continues rising, due in large part to Brazil, which accounts for more than half the total.Manaus, the Amazon rainforest’s largest city, was the first Brazilian metropolis whose health care system collapsed. For weeks, overwhelmed intensive-care units were unable to admit patients, deaths at home surged and a city cemetery buried bodies in mass graves.Such burials continue, yet the capital of Amazonas state on Monday began loosening its clamp on non-essential businesses. Amazonas registered 818 new COVID-19 cases Sunday, bringing the total number of cases above 40,000. There are more than 500,000 confirmed cases in Brazil, the second most in the world, and experts believe the true toll to be much higher due to insufficient testing.Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian city with the second-most cases after Sao Paulo, on Monday announced it would begin gradually relaxing restrictions the following day. A Already a city in its metropolitan region, Sao Joao de Meriti, started allowing salons, auto mechanics, and hotels to operate on Monday.“Brazil tends to look at Europe, and the problem is that there they did one or two months of strict quarantine and are now reopening,” said Renato Mendes Coutinho, a specialist in mathematical biology at COVID-19 BR Observatory, an independent group of more than 50 Brazilian researchers. “The difference is that the lockdown they implemented and the restriction measures were much more efficient and thorough.” Ecuador was one of the first South American nations slammed, with grim scenes of people leaving corpses outside their doorsteps in Guayaquil through March and April. The nation’s caseload continues to surge, yet its airport will resume international flights on June 3, according to Nicolás Romero, the airport’s spokesperson, though he said arriving passengers must spend 15 days in quarantine, without specifying how such quarantine will be enforced.The airport in capital, Quito, recorded its first flight in 80 days on Monday, and flights to Miami and Houston will take off on June 4.“It has just been one flight so far, but the important thing is the message it gives, of flying safely,” Luis Galárraga, the airport’s spokesperson, told The Associated Press.Across Ecuador’s border, Colombia has shut the international airport in its capital, Bogotá, until September and locked down an entire working-class district home to 1.5 million people. But in the nation’s second city, Medellin, malls cautiously began opening their doors on Monday, though checking customers’ temperatures upon entry.

02-06-2020||World||Trump describes protests in US as ‘terror’, threatens to deploy military||President Donald Trump on Monday threatened to deploy US military troops in towns and cities where local officials failed to stop the violence, looting and vandalism that have accompanied protests, which he described as “terror”, against the death of an African American man in police custody.In a speech from the White House, the president said he has asked state officials to deploy military reservists of the National Guard in “sufficient numbers to dominate the streets”. If a state of official refuses, he said, “I will deploy the United States military and quickly solve the problem for them”.’To protesters, he said, “I want the organisers of this terror to be on notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail.”The president also said he had ordered “swift and decisive action” to bring the situation under control in Washington DC.Even as he spoke, National Guard troops moved up to the front of the phalanx of law enforcement personnel facing protesters outside the White House. Flash-bang bombs, tear gas shells and rubber bullets were used to disperse a peaceful demonstration from a side of the White House facing Lafayette Square, a park that is an unofficial venue for White House protests.The president walked out of the White House shortly after and headed to a church on one side of the park that was damaged by protesters Sunday night. He was accompanied by some members of his cabinet such as Mark Esper and William Barr and new chief of staff Mark Meadows and son-in-law Jared Kushner and daughter Ivanka trump.The president held up a copy of the Bible on he steps of the church, which was closed, and posed for pictures with some members of the entourage. Church officials told reporters later the president was there without their permission and wanted to have nothing to do with his appearance.“Greatest country in the world,” Trump said when asked for what message he was seeking to deliver. “And we’re going to keep it safe.”Critics saw it as a stunt to counter the uncharitable but brutal blowback for taking shelter in an underground bunker on the first night of protests at the White House last Friday. The president, who likes to project himself as a tough-guy, has been seething over the scorn and mockery that followed.New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat who had praised Trump for federal help deal with Covid-19 in a state that had became the epicentre of the global and American epidemic, was characteristically blunt. “Calling out the American military for a photo opportunity. That’s what it was. I mean, it was shameful. It was really, truly shameful.”Trump had berated governors, specially those of the Democratic party, in a conference call earlier for being “weak” against protesters and had pressed them to do more, essentially giving them the same message that he delivered in the evening form the White House - “dominate” the streets with heavy presence of law enforcement personnel, including National Guard reservists.The president’s threat to deploy soldiers triggered debate about whether he had legal authority to do do. Under the Insurrection Act, a more than 200-year-old law, the president can deploy US military on American soil to deal with civil disorder, insurrection or rebellion.But it was last used at the request of a state, California in1992 to send troops into Los Angeles, a city rocked by protests in the aftermath of the acquittal of police officers accused of severely beating Rodney King, an African American man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-describes-protests-in-us-as-terror-threatens-to-deploy-military/story-5Pou3Mdv3yqVXTXmxLljxI.html
02-06-2020||World||Imran Khan lifts lockdown amid rising Covid-19 cases, urges Pakistan to ‘live with the virus’||Pakistan’s Prime Minister Imran Khan has announced his government would end the coronavirus lockdown despite the rising number of infections and deaths in the country citing economic losses and urged people to “live with the virus.”The Pakistan government has lifted almost all shutdown restrictions, primarily to avert an economic meltdown, and said the country would open to tourism but cinemas, theatres and schools will remain closed.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt has reported 72,460 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 1,543 deaths so far.Imran Khan’s announcement came shortly after an alarming government report was leaked to the media that showed Covid-19 cases in Lahore are estimated to be at about 670,800.Khan said Pakistan’s economic losses included a decline in exports, a 30% shortfall in revenues and remittances were expected to fall in coming months. Pakistan is facing a balance of payment crisis with the fiscal deficit likely to rise as high as 9.4% and the revenue shortfall.In a televised address, Khan said the country couldn’t afford to match the losses incurred during the lockdown as many other countries had done. He cited 50 million people who live below the poverty line and 25 million daily wagers. Khan said his government gave cash handouts to the poor, which wasn’t possible to continue on such a large scale, adding around 130 million to 150 million people were adversely affected by the coronavirus shutdowns. “Our conditions don’t allow that we keep feeding money to them, how long we can give them money,” Khan said.Khan was reluctant to call for a sweeping lockdown, so instead, the country’s four provinces ordered their own closures.“Unfortunately, the way lockdown occurred, that was very painful for our lower class,” Khan said, adding that the lockdown had affected the country’s tax-revenue collections. He defended his decision to reopen, arguing lockdowns don’t stop the virus.“You will have to understand this coronavirus, it’s not going to go unless a vaccine is discovered. We have to live with the coronavirus. The entire world has reached this conclusion,” Khan said, pointing to eased restrictions in US states.“Today, America, the richest country in the world, where 100,000 people have died because of corona, they too have decided that their economy would collapse if they (continue) a lockdown,” Khan said.He urged people to act responsibly but added that more infections and deaths were inevitable.“This virus will spread more. I have to say it with regret that there will be more deaths,” Khan said.“I request you all to please follow SOPs (standard operating procedures), as we are opening everything on the conditions of these SOPs,” Khan said in his address, warning people will suffer if they do not take precautions.According to its health ministry, 28,245 Covid-19 cases have been diagnosed in Sindh, 26,240 in Punjab, 10,027 in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa, 4,393 in Balochistan, 2,589 in Islamabad, 711 in Gilgit-Baltistan and 255 in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.The ministry showed that 26,083 patients have recovered so far from the virus and authorities have conducted 561,136 tests.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-lifts-lockdown-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-urges-pakistan-to-live-with-the-virus/story-9lmwJzHv9zc0owqy3GQW4M.html
02-06-2020||World||US adversaries highlight unrest to undercut criticism||Standing at a lectern with a backdrop map of the world behind him reminiscent of one at the State Department, the spokesman of Iran’s Foreign Ministry made a point Monday to criticize the US in English amid ongoing protests over police killings of black people.“To the American people, the world has ... heard your outcry over this state oppression,” Abbas Mousavi told reporters in Tehran.So too have Washington’s adversaries in Iran and elsewhere.Long the target of American criticism, these nations have used the protests over the killing of George Floyd as an opportunity to hit back at the country held up by US leaders for decades as “the shining city upon a hill.”By putting forth images of the unrest, they portray the US as a hypocritical superpower unable to secure its own people, as well as normalizing the violence and repression they visit on their own citizens.“To be clear, though they are trying to sympathize with protesters in the US, their aim is to leverage the internal divisions in America, ... not to advance the debate on this,” said Ariane Tabatabai, a Middle East fellow who studies Iran at the Washington-based German Marshall Fund.“Regime officials particularly like the theme of racial tensions in the US because it allows them to point the finger at Washington, which is often front and center condemning human rights abuses by the regime,” she said.That’s particularly valuable to Iran, which has violently put down recent nationwide economic demonstrations by killing hundreds, arresting thousands and disrupting internet access. The Islamic Republic has seen its already-ailing economy crater since President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew Washington from Tehran’s nuclear deal with world powers, cutting off its oil sales.“The American regime is pursuing violence and bullying at home and abroad,” Mousavi said.That criticism has extended to Twitter, which Iranian officials use extensively despite the website being banned since the mass protests and crackdown surrounding its disputed 2009 presidential election.Former hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, whose disputed re-election sparked the 2009 unrest, called Floyd’s killing “disturbing & upsetting.”Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif offered a rewritten statement earlier issued by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, crossing out Iran and replacing it with America.Pompeo responded by tweeting: “You hang homosexuals, stone women and exterminate Jews.”State-controlled media in China saw the protests through the prism of American views on Hong Kong’s anti-government demonstrations, which China has long said the US encouraged. In a commentary, the ruling Communist Party newspaper Global Times said Chinese experts had noted that US politicians might think twice before commenting again on Hong Kong, knowing “their words might backfire.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian offered his own criticism at a Beijing news conference.The protests “once again reflect the racial discrimination in the US, the serious problems of police violent enforcement and the urgency of solving these problems,” Zhao said.He added that China hopes the US will “safeguard and guarantee the legal rights of ethnic minorities.” That’s as China continues a yearslong, massive crackdown that has locked away more than 1 million ethnic minorities, most of them Muslims.In North Korea, the country’s official Rodong Sinmun newspaper reported about the demonstrations, saying that protesters “harshly condemned” a white policeman’s “lawless and brutal murder” of a black citizen.Three large photos showed protests from recent days from Minneapolis, where Floyd died May 25 after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes. The officer was fired and charged with murder, but protesters are demanding the three other officers at the scene be prosecuted.Rodong Sinmun noted hundreds of protesters gathered in front of the White House chanting, “No justice, no peace.” It did not make any direct comments about Trump, whom North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has met three times in high-profile summits.Russia said the United States had systemic human rights problems, criticism that followed a pattern dating to the Cold War. The 1957 integration of Little Rock Central High School by nine African American students supported by bayonet-carrying soldiers of the 101st Airborne Division saw one Soviet newspaper use the headline: “Troops Advance Against Children!”That information warfare continues today in the cyber-realm, as US intelligence agencies say Russia meddled America’s 2016 presidential election. Tabatabai said she and her colleagues had been tracking Chinese, Iranian and Russian social media accounts using the hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #GeorgeFloyd.US allies as well have been expressing their own opinions on the unrest. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesman said the arrests and assaults on journalists were “very concerning.” Zimbabwe summoned the US ambassador over US national security adviser Robert O’Brien’s allegation this weekend that Harare could be one of several foreign adversaries taking advantage of the demonstrations.Meanwhile, Germany’s center-left Social Democratic Party, which is a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s governing coalition, on Monday described itself as “157 (years old) and Antifa. Naturally.”The tweet appeared to be a response to Trump’s assertion that he would designate Antifa, an umbrella description for the far-left-leaning militant groups that resist neo-Nazis and white supremacists at demonstrations and other events, “a terrorist organization.”Across from the US Embassy in Paris, dozens of people knelt in silent protest, urging the French government to take racism and police violence more seriously. Despite a ban on gatherings of more than 10 people because of the coronavirus, they held signs reading “I Can’t Breathe” in English, or “Racism is suffocating us” and “We are all George Floyd” in French.Thousands of people packed Dam Square in central Amsterdam and spilled into several side streets in an unexpectedly large protest to denounce police brutality in the US and Europe. They chanted “Black lives matter!” raising their fists and holding anti-racism signs.In Perth, Australia, the hundreds of demonstrators who peacefully protested Floyd’s death also sought to highlight injustices against indigenous Australians.“I believe it’s important as a young indigenous woman to vocalise that this isn’t just an American issue, this is a black people issue and indigenous people fit into that category,” organizer Tanesha Bennell told Nine Network television.Protesters carried banners with messages including “No Pride in Genocide” and tears appeared as the names of indigenous people who have died in Australian police custody were read to the crowd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-adversaries-highlight-unrest-to-undercut-criticism/story-IaD9VVaepx6Pry66YrPc9O.html
02-06-2020||World||Hundreds of Facebook employees walk out over Zuckerberg’s inaction on Trump’s posts||Facebook employees walked away from their work-from-home desks on Monday and took to Twitter to accuse Chief Executive Mark Zuckerberg of inadequately policing US President Donald Trump’s posts as strictly as the rival platform has done.Reuters saw dozens of online posts from employees critical of Zuckerberg’s decision to leave Trump’s most inflammatory verbiage unchallenged where Twitter had labelled it. Some top managers participated in the protest, reminiscent of a 2018 walkout at Alphabet Inc’s Google over sexual harassment.It was a rare case of staff publicly taking their CEO to task, with one employee tweeting that thousands participated. Among them were all seven engineers on the team maintaining the React code library which supports Facebook’s apps.In photos: Rage and anguish from George Floyd protests spreading across US cities“Facebook’s recent decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe. We implore the Facebook leadership to #TakeAction,” they said in a joint statement published on Twitter. The React Core team is joining the Facebook employee walkout in solidarity with the Black community.Facebookʼs recent decision to not act on posts that incite violence ignores other options to keep our community safe.

He added he had mobilized “50+ likeminded folks” to lobby for internal change. Mark is wrong, and I will endeavor in the loudest possible way to change his mind.A Facebook employee said Zuckerberg’s weekly Friday question-and-answer session would be moved up this week to Tuesday.Katie Zhu, a product manager at Instagram, tweeted a screenshot showing she had entered “#BLACKLIVESMATTER” to describe her request for time off as part of the walkout.Facebook Inc will allow employees participating in the protest to take the time off without drawing down their vacation days, spokesman Andy Stone said.Separately, online therapy company Talkspace said it ended partnership discussions with Facebook. Talkspace CEO Oren Frank tweeted he would “not support a platform that incites violence, racism, and lies.”Social justiceTech workers at companies including Facebook, Google, and Amazon.com Inc have pursued social justice issues in recent years, urging the companies to change policies. Employees “recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community,” Stone wrote in a text.“We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership. As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we’ll continue seeking their honest feedback.”Last week, nationwide unrest erupted after the death of a black man, George Floyd, in police custody in Minneapolis last Monday. Video footage showed a white officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes before he died. On Friday, Twitter Inc affixed a warning label to a Trump tweet that included the phrase “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Twitter said it violated rules against glorifying violence but was left up as a public interest exception.Facebook declined to act on the same message, and Zuckerberg sought to distance his company from the fight between the president and Twitter.On Friday, Zuckerberg said in a Facebook post that while he found Trump’s remarks “deeply offensive,” they did not violate company policy against incitements to violence and people should know whether the government was planning to deploy force.Zuckerberg’s post also said Facebook had been in touch with the White House to explain its policies.Jason Toff, a director of product management and former head of short-form video app Vine, was one of several Facebook employees organizing fundraisers for racial justice groups in Minnesota. Zuckerberg wrote on Facebook on Monday the company would contribute an additional $10 million to social justice causes.Toff tweeted: “I work at Facebook and I am not proud of how we’re showing up. The majority of coworkers I’ve spoken to feel the same way. We are making our voice heard.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-of-facebook-employees-walk-out-over-zuckerberg-s-inaction-on-trump-s-posts/story-36GpTo94FnMp8xGfOxqAvJ.html
02-06-2020||World||‘Hate just hides’: Biden vows to take on systematic racism in US||Joe Biden vowed to address institutional racism in his first 100 days in office as he sought to elevate his voice Monday in the exploding national debate over racism and police brutality.The presumptive Democratic presidential nominee offered emotional support and promised bold action during an in-person discussion with black leaders in Delaware and a subsequent virtual meeting with big-city mayors who are grappling with racial tensions and frustrated by a lack of federal support.“Hate just hides. It doesn’t go away, and when you have somebody in power who breathes oxygen into the hate under the rocks, it comes out from under the rocks,” Biden told more than a dozen African American leaders gathered at a church in downtown Wilmington, his face mask lowered around his chin as he spoke.Without offering specifics, he promised to “deal with institutional racism” and set up a police oversight body in his first 100 days in office, if elected. The former vice president also said he’d be releasing an economic plan focused on education, housing and “access to capital” and investments, especially for minority Americans, later this month.“I really do believe that the blinders have been taken off. I think this tidal wave is moving,” Biden told the mayors of Atlanta, Chicago, Los Angeles and St. Paul, Minnesota. “I realize we’ve got to do something big, we can do it, and everyone will benefit from it.”Largely sheltering in place amid the coronavirus, Biden has struggled in recent weeks to be heard from his makeshift home TV studio over the noise of dueling national crises. But after another night of violent protests, he ventured out into public for the second time in two days and just the third time since the pandemic arrived in mid-March.His hopeful and collaborative approach marked a sharp contrast to that of President Donald Trump, who has made little effort to unify the country. The Republican president slammed governors as “weak” during a video teleconference on Monday and demanded tougher crackdowns on protesters. Trump also lashed out at Biden on Twitter, writing that “Sleepy Joe Biden’s people are so Radical Left that they are working to get the Anarchists out of jail, and probably more.”Biden’s softer style may foreshadow how he presents himself in the five months before the presidential election, emphasizing calm and competence as a contrast to a mercurial president. It is an approach that carries the risk of being drowned out by Trump’s much louder voice.On Monday evening, Trump declared himself “the president of law and order” from the White House as military police and law enforcement fired tear gas and cleared protesters from nearby Lafayette Park. Biden made no mention of the unfolding events during an online fundraiser that took place at the same time, though he talked at length about persistent racism in the U.S.“He’s not in office, and he certainly does not have the megaphone like the person currently occupying the White House does, but I do think our people are looking for someone who can make them feel better during these extremely tough times,” said Rep. Val Demings of Florida, whom Biden is considering as a running mate. “America just needs to be reassured that there’s someone who’s understanding, someone who’s willing to say, ‘Yes, we do have some issues,’ and someone who’s willing to address it.”Biden delivered a well-received address on Friday calling on white people to shoulder the responsibility of ending America’s systemic racism. But he was largely out of sight over the weekend, which marked the fifth anniversary of the death of his son Beau Biden from brain cancer.Biden and his wife, Jill, marked Memorial Day by laying a wreath at a veterans’ memorial near his Wilmington home last week, and the former vice president’s campaign posted pictures of him visiting a protest site in the city on Sunday afternoon. Earlier, he wrote a post on Medium expressing empathy for those despairing about the police killing of George Floyd.In the early moments of Monday’s gathering at the Bethel AME church in Wilmington, Biden listened quietly and took notes. All the attendees, including Biden, wore face masks but lowered them as they spoke.“The vice president came to hear from us. This is a homeboy,” pastor Sylvester Beaman said before everyone bowed their heads in prayer.Biden’s standing with the black community weighs heavily as he works to deny Trump a second term. African Americans rescued Biden’s flailing primary campaign, but it’s unclear if they will turn out for him in large numbers in November.“I want to make something clear. I don’t expect anything from the black community,” Biden said Monday, insisting he has never taken its support for granted. The former vice president has been doing cleanup since telling a prominent black radio host a week and a half ago that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black.”Yet the mayors who spoke with Biden, three of whom are black, were clearly frustrated and angry with Trump, who has offered military support to address violent protests while denying them federal support to address the coronavirus fallout and repeatedly attacking them on social media.“To see the president of the United States say that he’s going to send the military into our communities but hadn’t mentioned sending a single dime of support into our communities, speaks to where we are in America,” said Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms.Much of Biden’s campaign strategy centers on trying to draw a contrast with Trump on temperament and values. He has called the White House contest a battle for the soul of the nation and has been particularly forceful in condemning Trump’s handling of moments of racial tension.In an election that is likely to be a referendum on the sitting president, some Biden aides say privately that the best plan may be to let Trump do himself in.Yet there is also a recognition that Biden needs to do more than simply wait for voters who may be turned off by Trump to turn toward him. Some Democrats who have criticized Biden for not being more visible during the onset of the coronavirus said he is making the right moves now.“I’m sure they have some reluctance, understandably, right now to politicize it. That’s not who he is,” said Democratic strategist James Carville. “There might be a time for eloquence, but I think that simplicity is eloquence right now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hate-just-hides-biden-vows-to-take-on-systematic-racism-in-us/story-yNg8tJCpKEIWrjcOgr2dlI.html
02-06-2020||World||Boris Johnson revamps agenda to meet worst UK recession in 300 years||Boris Johnson plans to re-set his government’s agenda with a major speech and a financial statement to prepare the U.K. for the new reality after the coronavirus pandemic.Amid forecasts of the worst recession in 300 years, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak is drawing up options to bolster the economy after the government withdraws its vast package of financial support in the months ahead, according to people familiar with the matter.For Johnson, the priority will be to focus on reasserting his broader political mission in the age of the virus, one person said. The Conservative Party leader and public face of Brexit, Johnson was elected with a large majority just six months ago on a promise to “level up” the forgotten parts of the country.Yet his plans have been derailed by the global pandemic, with his government’s agenda put on ice as the coronavirus crisis took over. Work has begun on preparing for a key speech, expected at the end of June, one person said.On Monday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock promised more details on the “economic response” later this summer after he was asked about government preparations for a recession amid fears of bankruptcies and job losses.‘Working So Hard’“The economy’s going to have to change,” Hancock told the government’s daily virus briefing in London. “We’re going to have to be a different type of economy as we come out of this and you’re going to hear more of that from the chancellor and the prime minister, who’ve been working so hard on this, in the weeks and months to come.”Officials privately confirmed work is under way on a fiscal event but said it is too early to be precise about the detailed policy proposals, or about the date, though one person said it is likely to be in July.Among the questions that have been discussed among Johnson’s allies include whether there is potential to raise income tax or national insurance specifically to pay for investment in the National Health Service. Business taxes may also rise, as internal polling suggests there is public support for increases in corporation tax.Support MeasuresOther options could include a windfall tax on sectors that have profited during the pandemic -- such as supermarkets or technology companies, one person familiar with discussions said.Sunak, who has spent unprecedented amounts supporting the UK economy during the coronavirus crisis, kept the spending taps firmly on last week as he announced plans to taper his job support program, unveiling an incremental withdrawal in a bid to avert a mass wave of unemployment this summer.The self-employed will be offered a grant of as much as 6,570 pounds ($8,205) in August to cover another three months of earnings, while furloughed workers will continue to receive 80% of wages through October. Employers will only start taking the burden of their National Insurance and pension contributions in August, before paying 10% of workers’ wages in September, and 20% the following month, the chancellor said.The two jobs’ plans are currently supporting 10.7 million jobs, and have come at a cost of almost 22 billion pounds. The cost of both programs could easily breach 100 billion pounds, about 11% of total government spending in a normal year and equivalent to the amount spent on the National Health Service, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-revamps-agenda-to-meet-worst-uk-recession-in-300-years/story-A6lDmwvovGE9sauAVT8E7L.html
02-06-2020||World||Trump threatens to deploy military amid rising protests against police violence||Amid racial unrest across the nation, President Donald Trump on Monday declared himself “the president of law and order” and threatened to deploy the United States military to American cities to quell a rise of violent protests. As Trump spoke, an incredible TV split screen developed around the White House. While he addressed the nation in the White House’s idyllic Rose Garden, a series of military vehicles rolled out front on Pennsylvania Avenue and military police and law enforcement clashed with protesters at Lafayette Park. Trump said he would mobilize “thousands and thousands” of soldiers to keep the peace if governors did not use the National Guard to shut down the protests. Loud tear gas explosions could be heard as authorities moved what appeared to be peaceful protests in the park. The escalation came just after Attorney General William Barr came to the park to to survey the demonstrators. According to senior defense officials, between 600 and 800 National Guard members from five states were being sent to Washington to provide assistance. Those troops were either already on the ground or will arrive by midnight. Under the Civil War-era Posse Comitatus Act, federal troops are prohibited from performing domestic law enforcement actions such as making arrests, seizing property or searching people. In extreme cases, however, the president can invoke the Insurrection Act, also from the Civil War, which allows the use of active-duty or National Guard troops for law enforcement. The officials said that some of the National Guard in DC will be armed and others will not. They said that the DC guard members do not have non-lethal weapons. The military police that are visible in the city are members of the Guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-declares-he-s-president-of-law-order-amid-protests/story-sC0e0F2kTzFN25961khx0I.html
02-06-2020||World||Gilead says Remdesivir Drug helped moderately ill Covid-19 patients||A California biotech company said on Monday that its experimental drug remdesivir improved symptoms when given for five days to moderately ill, hospitalised patients with Covid-19.Gilead Sciences gave few details on Monday, but said full results would soon be published in a medical journal.Remdesivir is the only treatment that’s been shown in a rigorous experiment to help fight the coronavirus. A large study led by the National Institutes of Health recently found it could shorten average recovery time from 15 days to 11 days in hospitalised patients with severe disease.The drug is given through an IV and is designed to interfere with an enzyme the virus uses to copy its genetic material. It’s approved for treating Covid-19 in Japan and is authorised for emergency use in the US for certain patients.The company-led study involved nearly 600 patients who had moderate pneumonia but did not need oxygen support. All were randomly assigned to get five or 10 days of the drug plus standard care, or standard care alone. Patients and their doctors knew who was getting what, which limits the objectivity of the results.By the 11th day in the study, those on five days of remdesivir were 65% more likely to improve by at least one on a seven-point scale, Gilead said.Ten days of treatment did not prove better than standard care alone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gilead-says-remdesivir-drug-helped-moderately-ill-covid-19-patients/story-zqNKqNZylbXQqL3WFEho5K.html
02-06-2020||World||4,000 across US arrested as protests over George Floyd’s death continue||Around 4,000 people across the United States have been arrested during the massive protests over the death of African-American man George Floyd last month.The first arrests were made on May 26 and since then there have been around 4,000 arrests across the US so far, CNN reported.While the anger continues to spread, the country is waiting for an address from President Donald Trump about the protests following the death of Floyd.On Friday night (local time), Trump had briefly moved to an underground bunker as violence raged outside the White House. He again took shelter on Sunday night.Meanwhile, several organisations like Google and YouTube have expressed support for racial equality.Google’s CEO Sundar Pichai shared a picture of Google homepage which had a black ribbon at the bottom with a message that read, “We stand in support of racial equality and all those who search for it.”Also, YouTube’s official Twitter handle’s icon has been changed to black from red.Protests erupted in Minneapolis and other US cities last Tuesday after Floyd died following his arrest by four officers.A viral video showed a police officer, Derek Chauvin, pinning the 46-year-old Floyd to the ground with his knee on his neck for nearly eight minutes. Floyd died at a local hospital shortly thereafter.The four police officers were fired. Chauvin was also charged with murder and manslaughter, according to Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-000-across-us-arrested-as-protests-over-george-floyd-s-death-continue/story-jSLN2FEXSnugQLNtVBthRK.html
02-06-2020||World||Europe loosens lockdown as Coronavirus tightens grip on Americas||Europe took bolder steps in easing coronavirus lockdowns Monday, with some pubs, tourist sites, pools and schools reopening despite fears of a second wave of infections, while in Latin America new cases piled up past the one million mark.The pandemic has now killed more than 372,000 people and infected at least 6.1 million since erupting in China last year -- and efforts to halt its spread by imposing restrictions on everyday life have plunged several economies into recession. The United States, where the ongoing crisis has now been overshadowed by anti-racism protests provoked by police killings, is by some distance the worst affected country, but cases are also spreading quickly in Latin America, particularly in troubled giant Brazil.Nevertheless, from Russia to France, Italy and Britain, countries have started to emerge from months-long lockdowns, cautiously adopting a post-pandemic version of normal. Bars began to serve again n Finland and Finland -- albeit with distancing restrictions or shortened hours -- while some schools in Britain and Greece opened their doors again. But the decision to allow schools to partially reopen in Britain drew criticism from some who accuse Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government of moving too fast to end a lockdown that he has been accused of being too slow to impose.“Covid-19 spreading too fast to lift lockdown in England,” scientific advisor Jeremy Farrar said on Twitter.There has also been scepticism in Russia, where Moscow shopping malls and parks reopened on Monday despite the still-high number of cases, although there was also cautious hope among shopkeepers eager to see business pick up again. “We opened two hours ago but we already have a few clients. I’m pretty optimistic, I think people will come back little by little,” Olga told AFP at her shop selling handbags and jewelry in central Moscow. While reopening parts of his own country, Russia’s President Vladimir Putin also called Armenia’s Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan to wish him a speedy recovery, as he became the latest leader to test positive.‘Beloved beer’Elsewhere in Europe, still bolder steps were taken. Greece opened some hotels, schools, pools and tattoo parlours, while in Slovenia a mandatory rule to wear masks was eased as the country declared the end of the outbreak.Slovenes enjoyed a fly-over by US and local military jets to mark the “end of the pandemic” and to thank frontline health workers, while in Romania excited families queued for the reopening of Bucharest’s Grigore Antipa Natural History Museum.“I love animals, dinosaurs!” declared seven-year-old Robert, as his mum Manuela expressed relief that the lockdown was ending and she could bring him out to follow his passion. “It was his most ardent wish,” she smiled.Rome’s famed Colosseum also opened to visitors -- Italian nationals only -- for the first time since March, drawing sparse crowds. “We took advantage of the fact that foreign tourists aren’t here yet,” said Pierluigi, adding that it was his first visit to the massive ancient amphitheatre.And in South Africa, scores of people queued outside liquor stores in the Johannesburg township of Soweto, waiting to stock up after a nine-week ban on alcohol sales.The mood was festive with customers carrying crates of empty beer bottles, blasting loud music from their stereos.“We are overwhelmed, over the moon, so excited. This place is jamming,” said Bongani Khumalo. “I’m here to buy my beloved beer,” said 31-year-old Anele Mapoma. “It has been a while since I had a taste of that foam and burping.” 1 million cases The pandemic has devastated the global economy, which is facing its worst downturn since the Great Depression. With businesses and citizens growing tired of confinement, there is pressure on many leaders to press on with reopenings -- especially in nations where outbreaks appear to be slowing.But health experts have continued to warn of the possibility of a second wave of infections if authorities and citizens let their guard down.Brazil has more than half a million known infections and the second highest caseload in the world after the US, but President Jair Bolsonaro has defied lockdown recommendations and many of his supporters dismiss the disease as a myth.In a grim new landmark, infections in Latin America and the Caribbean surged past one million, according to an AFP tally based on official sources. In the United States -- the worst-affected nation in the world, and now faced with a wave of street protests against police killings of unarmed black suspects -- Washington and Los Angeles resumed outdoor dining, while New York City is on track to begin reopening from June 8.The US now has more than 104,000 coronavirus deaths and over 1.7 million cases. Meanwhile, in the Democratic Republic of Congo, there was a reminder that while much of the world struggles with coronavirus, other infectious threats continue. The health ministry reported a fresh Ebola outbreak in the northwest of the huge central African country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-loosens-lockdown-as-coronavirus-tightens-grip-on-americas/story-fAPvG87WrYBMvPgiWqCPSJ.html
02-06-2020||World||Indian government rejects Pakistan’s assertions about expelled officials||India rejected Pakistan’s contention that two of its high commission staff were detained on unsubstantiated charges and tortured, people familiar with developments said on Monday that the officials were caught red handed while indulging in spying. New Delhi on Sunday expelled two junior officials of the Pakistan high commission after they were detained during an operation by the Delhi Police and Military Intelligence while trying to obtain classified documents on security installations. Pakistan condemned India’s decision to declare the two officials persona non grata and to expel them, saying they were detained on “false and unsubstantiated charges”. A statement from Pakistan’s Foreign Office also contended that the two men were tortured and threatened to “accept false charges” despite identifying themselves as diplomatic staff. “The assertions of the Pakistan Foreign Office are false. The two officials were caught red handed while indulging in espionage activities,” said one of the people cited above, speaking on condition of anonymity. “They did not disclose their identity that they were high commission officials. When they were taken into custody and questioned, they confessed to indulging in espionage and also informed that they were high commission officials,” the person added. The Pakistani mission was immediately informed and the two men were handed over, the person said. “They were never subjected to any torture. They have also undergone medical examination. Pakistan appears to be making false accusations and possibly creating ground for some tit for tat reaction and torture of Indian officials in Islamabad,” the person cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-government-rejects-pakistan-s-assertions-about-expelled-officials/story-ptFEsA3Ol0eLd6DWrBIVzN.html
02-06-2020||World||‘I can’t breathe’ protests spread across America after Minneapolis killing||Thousands of protesters stormed the perimeter of Barclays Center in New York as protests spread across the United States over the killing of George Floyd, a Minneapolis black man who died after being pinned by the neck under a white police officer’s knee.Police made scores of arrests at Friday’s massive demonstration in Brooklyn, loading cuffed protesters onto city buses lined up on Atlantic Avenue, shutting down a major thoroughfare. A diverse group of protesters cheered to hip hop music and tried to argue about police brutality with police officers in riot gear, who occasionally lunged into crowds to pluck people out for arrest after bottles and other projectiles were thrown.The demonstrators at a “We can’t breathe” vigil and rally in lower Manhattan were pressing for legislation outlawing the police “chokehold” used by a city police officer in the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was also black. ATLANTAIn an impassioned speech, Bernice King, the youngest daughter of civil rights icon Martin Luther King Jr., implored people to go home after more than 1,000 protesters marched to the state capitol from the Centennial Olympic Park, blocking traffic and an interstate highway along the way.“The only way we get what we really want is through non-violence,” Bernice King said in her father’s hometown. “Let’s do this the non-violent way to deal with the evil of our time.”King was assassinated in 1968, a year after race riots spread across many big cities.The Atlanta demonstration turned chaotic and at times violent. Fires were burning in downtown Atlanta near the CNN Center, the network’s headquarters.At least one police car was among several vehicles burnt. Windows were smashed at the CNN building, along with store fronts. Police pushed back the crowd, but they hurled bottles at officers.MINNEAPOLISHundreds of protesters defied an 8 p.m. curfew to gather in the streets around a police station burnt the previous night.“We are out here because we, as a generation, realize things have to change,” said one marcher, Paul Selman, a 25-year-old black man, who had just graduated with a master’s degree in English from Minnesota State. “We need peace.” “Our parents and grandparents are tired of seeing their kids die all of the time, so we have to take it upon ourselves to make a better future.”Peter McMahon, 26, a resident of the area around the police station and owner of two nearby properties, said, “This is my generation and these are the people I went to high school with,” adding, “This is not a surprise. I have lost good friends over this Black Lives Matter shit.”DETROITHundreds in the automotive capital joined a “March Against Police Brutality” late in the afternoon outside the Detroit Public Safety Headquarters. Many chanted, “No justice, no peace.” Some carried signs that read, “End police brutality” and “I won’t stop yelling until everyone can breathe.”DENVERDenver saw a second day of protests after hundreds marched peacefully through its downtown demanding justice for Floyd.On Thursday night, Denver police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse crowds after parked cars were vandalized. There were 13 arrests related to the protests.HOUSTONHundreds gathered on Friday in a protest organized by the group Black Lives Matter at City Hall. The crowd spilled onto Interstate 45’s entrance ramp near downtown chanting, “I can’t breathe,” and “No justice, no peace.” LOUISVILLEAfter a night of violence in which at least seven people were shot, police in the Kentucky city braced for more protests over the killing of Floyd and several others, such as Breonna Taylor, shot by police in her Louisville home in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/i-can-t-breathe-protests-spread-across-america-after-minneapolis-killing/story-lPadfXDQf5QUPFgDZDZXsO.html
02-06-2020||World||Minneapolis cop who knelt on man’s neck charged with murder||The white Minneapolis police officer who knelt on George Floyd’s neck was arrested and charged with murder Friday, and authorities imposed an overnight curfew to try to stem three nights of often-violent protests that left dozens of stores burned and looted. Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in the case. He was also accused of ignoring another officer at the scene who expressed concerns about the black man as he lay handcuffed on the ground, pleading that he could not breathe. Floyd had been arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit bill at a small grocery store.Also Read: Officer who put knee on man’s neck should be charged, says Minneapolis mayor An attorney for Floyd’s family welcomed the arrest, but said he expected a more serious murder charge and wants all four officers involved to be arrested. Hennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said more charges were possible. He said the investigation into the other three officers continues, but authorities “felt it appropriate to focus on the most dangerous perpetrator.” Meanwhile, Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey declared a curfew from 8 pm to 6 am on Friday and Saturday. The order said no one can be out in public except emergency responders and people seeking medical care, fleeing danger or those who are homeless. “I know that whatever hope you feel today is tempered with scepticism and a righteous outrage,” Frey said in a statement. “Today’s decision from the County Attorney is an essential first step on a longer road toward justice and healing our city.” According to the criminal complaint, Chauvin allegedly disregarded the concerns of another officer, who wanted to roll Floyd onto his side as he was being held down. The papers also said that an autopsy revealed nothing to support strangulation as the cause of death. The exam concluded that the combined effects of being restrained, potential intoxicants in Floyd’s system and his underlying health issues, including heart disease, likely contributed to his death. Floyd’s family was seeking an independent autopsy. Police were trying to put Floyd in a squad car when he stiffened up and fell to the ground, saying he was claustrophobic, the complaint said. Chauvin and officer Tou Thoa arrived to help and tried several times to get the struggling Floyd into the car, it said. At one point, Chauvin pulled Floyd out of the car’s passenger side, and Floyd, who was handcuffed, went to the ground face down. Officer JK Kueng held Floyd’s back, and officer Thomas Lane held his legs, while Chauvin put his knee on Floyd’s head and neck area, the complaint said. When Lane asked if Floyd should be rolled onto his side Chauvin said, “No, staying put is where we got him.” Lane said he was “worried about excited delirium or whatever,” and Chauvin replied, “That’s why we have him on his stomach,” according to the complaint. After Floyd apparently stopped breathing, Lane again said he wanted to roll Chauvin onto his side. Kueng checked for a pulse and said he could not find one, the complaint said. In all, Chauvin had his knee on Floyd’s neck for 8 minutes, 46 seconds, including nearly three minutes after Floyd stopped moving and talking, according to the complaint. Chauvin’s attorney had no comment when reached by The Associated Press. Freeman, whose home has been picketed by protesters, highlighted the “extraordinary speed” in charging the case just four days after Floyd’s death, but also defended himself against questions about why it did not happen sooner. He said his office needed time to put together evidence, including what he called the “horrible” video recorded by a bystander. All four officers at the scene of Floyd’s arrest on Monday were fired the next day. After the charges were announced, protesters outside government offices chanted, “All four got to go.” It was not immediately clear whether Chauvin’s arrest would quiet the unrest, which escalated again Thursday night as demonstrators burned a Minneapolis police station soon after officers abandoned it. Protests also spread across the US, fuelled by outrage over Floyd’s death, and years of violence against African Americans at the hands of police. Demonstrators clashed with officers in New York and blocked traffic in Columbus, Ohio, and Denver. News of the arrest came moments after Minnesota Governor Tim Walz acknowledged the “abject failure” of the response to the protests and called for swift justice for the officers. Walz said the state had taken over the response to the violence. “Minneapolis and St. Paul are on fire. The fire is still smoldering in our streets. The ashes are symbolic of decades and generations of pain, of anguish unheard,” Walz said. “Now generations of pain is manifesting itself in front of the world — and the world is watching.” President Donald Trump threatened action, tweeting “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” which prompted a warning from Twitter for “glorifying violence.” Trump later said he was referring to shooting that had happened during the protests.

02-06-2020||World||Minnesota governor apologizes for arrest of CNN crew||Following the arrest of a CNN crew on live television by police on Friday, an apologetic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised that journalists would not be interfered with in reporting on violent protests following the death of George Floyd.CNN correspondent Omar Jimenez and two colleagues were released within an hour after network chief executive Jeff Zucker called Walz to demand answers about why they were led away and held in a police van.“We have got to ensure that there is a safe spot for journalism to tell this story,” Walz said.Jimenez and colleagues Bill Kirkos and Leonel Mendez were doing a live shot for CNN’s “New Day” shortly after 5 a.m. Central Time, describing a night of fire and anger in the wake of Floyd’s death after a Minneapolis police office knelt on his neck. Fired officer Derek Chauvin was charged with murder in that case later Friday.When first approached by officers, Jimenez, who is black, told them, “put us back where you want us. We are getting out of your way.”After being told he was being arrested and his hands were tied behind his back, Jimenez asked why he was being arrested. He did not get an answer.The Minnesota State Patrol said on Twitter that the journalists were among four people arrested as troopers were “clearing the streets and restoring order” following the protests. The patrol said the CNN journalists “were released once they were confirmed to be members of the media.”It’s not clear why they were confused: Jimenez was holding what appeared to be a laminated ID card before his hands were secured, and his fellow crew members told police that they were from CNN and showing the scene live on the air.“I’ve never seen anything like this,” CNN “New Day” co-anchor John Berman said.After being released, Jimenez said that he was glad that his arrest was shown on the air.“You don’t have to doubt my story,” he said. “It’s not filtered in any way. You saw it for your own eyes. That gave me a little bit of comfort. But it was definitely nerve-wracking.”At a later news conference, Walz said that “I take full responsibility. There is absolutely no reason something like that should happen ... This is a very public apology to that team.”The arrest drew widespread condemnation across the news industry. CNN competitors MSNBC, CBS News and Fox News all issued statements in support of Jimenez, along with the Society of Professional Journalists and the National Association of Black Journalists.CNN accepted Walz’s apology, saying the network appreciated the sincerity of his words.Walz’s words in support of journalists have impact at a time when the news media is often under attack, said Jane E. Kirtley, Silha Professor of Media Ethics and Law and director of the Silha Center at the University of Minnesota.“It’s really important for the governor to make that kind of statement to emphasize to everyone, especially law enforcement, that the press has an important job to do ... and they need to be respected,” said Kirtley, who lives blocks away from the protests and could still smell smoke from the fires on Friday.Later Friday, the network was again thrust into the story when hundreds of protesters confronted police outside CNN’s downtown Atlanta headquarters. Activists spray-painted a large CNN logo outside the building, breaking a window and tagging doors. One protester climbed on top of the CNN sign and waved a “Black Lives Matter” flag to cheers from the crowd.As anchor Chris Cuomo opened his prime-time show, he told viewers the network’s headquarters had been “swarmed and defaced.” Footage of the damage outside was mixed with scenes from other protests around the country.Meanwhile, there were signs Friday that cable news networks, who were spending much of their time covering the story, have become sensitive to the impact of showing witness video of Floyd’s treatment by police.News anchors on all three networks usually warned viewers of its graphic nature before showing the video.“I must warn you that this is difficult to watch,” said CNN’s Brianna Keilar, “but it is important to remember.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minnesota-governor-apologizes-for-arrest-of-cnn-crew/story-fuvzHegW3sLA5cSgJcnmbJ.html

02-06-2020||World||George Floyd protesters set Minneapolis police station afire||Cheering protesters broke into a Minneapolis police precinct station on Thursday after the department abandoned it, setting it ablaze and setting off fireworks as three days of violent protests spread to nearby St. Paul and angry demonstrations flared across the U.S over the death of George Floyd, a handcuffed black man.A police spokesman confirmed late Thursday that staff had evacuated the 3rd precinct station, the focus of many of the protests, “in the interest of the safety of our personnel” shortly after 10 p.m. Livestream video showed the protesters entering the building, where fire alarms blared and sprinklers ran as blazes were set.Protesters could be seen setting fire to a Minneapolis Police Department jacket and cheering.Also Read: Twitter attaches disclaimer to Trump’s Minneapolis tweet for ‘glorifying violence’Protests first erupted Tuesday, a day after Floyd’s death in a confrontation with police captured on widely seen citizen video. On the video, Floyd can be seen pleading that he can’t breathe as Officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, kneels on his neck. As minutes pass, Floyd slowly stops talking and moving. The 3rd Precinct covers the portion of south Minneapolis where Floyd died.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz earlier Thursday activated the National Guard at the Minneapolis mayor’s request, but it wasn’t immediately clear when and where the Guard was being deployed, and none could be seen during protests in Minneapolis or St. Paul. The Guard tweeted minutes after the precinct burned that it had activated more than 500 soldiers across the metro area.The Guard tweeted that a “key objective” was to make sure fire departments could respond to calls, and said in a follow-up tweet it was “here with the Minneapolis Fire Department” to assist. But no move was made to put out the 3rd Precinct fire. A department spokesman didn’t immediately respond to a phone call. Fire Chief John Fruetel told CNN that the department couldn’t get to the scene for safety reasons.Earlier Thursday, dozens of businesses across the Twin Cities boarded up their windows and doors in an effort to prevent looting, with Minneapolis-based Target announcing it was temporarily closing two dozen area stores. Minneapolis shut down nearly its entire light-rail system and all bus service through Sunday out of safety concerns.In St. Paul, clouds of smoke hung in the air as police armed with batons and wearing gas masks and body armor kept a watchful eye on protesters along one of the city’s main commercial corridors, where firefighters also sprayed water onto a series of small fires. At one point, officers stood in line in front of a Target, trying to keep out looters, who were also smashing windows of other businesses.Hundreds of demonstrators returned Thursday to the Minneapolis neighborhood at the center of the violence, where the nighttime scene veered between an angry protest and a street party. At one point, a band playing in a parking lot across from the 3rd Precinct broke into a punk version of Bob Marley’s “Redemption Song.” Nearby, demonstrators carried clothing mannequins from a looted Target and threw them onto a burning car. Later, a building fire erupted nearby.But elsewhere in Minneapolis, thousands of peaceful demonstrators marched through the streets calling for justice.Floyd’s death has deeply shaken Minneapolis and sparked protests in cities across the U.S. Local leaders have repeatedly urged demonstrators to avoid violence.“Please stay home. Please do not come here to protest. Please keep the focus on George Floyd, on advancing our movement and on preventing this from ever happening again,” tweeted St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter, who is black.Erika Atson, 20, was among thousands of people who gathered outside government offices in downtown Minneapolis, where organizers had called a peaceful protest. Many protesters wore masks because of the coronavirus pandemic, but there were few attempts at social distancing.Atson, who is black, described seeing her 14- and 11-year-old brothers tackled by Minneapolis police years ago because officers mistakenly presumed the boys had guns. She said she had been at “every single protest” since Floyd’s death and worried about raising children who could be vulnerable in police encounters.“We don’t want to be here fighting against anyone. We don’t want anyone to be hurt. We don’t want to cause any damages,” she said. “We just want the police officer to be held accountable.”Hennepin County Sheriff David Hutchinson said the rally had been peaceful and there had been no arrests by late evening.After calling in the Guard, Walz urged widespread changes in the wake of Floyd’s death.“It is time to rebuild. Rebuild the city, rebuild our justice system and rebuild the relationship between law enforcement and those they’re charged to protect,” Walz said.Much of the Minneapolis violence occurred in the Longfellow neighborhood, where protesters converged on the precinct station of the police who arrested Floyd. In a strip mall across the street from the 3rd Precinct station, the windows in nearly every business had been smashed, from the large Target department store at one end to the Planet Fitness gym at the other. Only the 24-hour laundromat appeared to have escaped unscathed.“WHY US?” demanded a large expanse of red graffiti scrawled on the wall of the Target. A Wendy’s restaurant across the street was charred almost beyond recognition.Among the casualties of the overnight fires: a six-story building under construction that was to provide nearly 200 apartments of affordable housing.“We’re burning our own neighborhood,” said a distraught Deona Brown, a 24-year-old woman standing with a friend outside the precinct station, where a small group of protesters were shouting at a dozen or so stone-faced police officers in riot gear. “This is where we live, where we shop, and they destroyed it.” No officers could be seen beyond the station.“What that cop did was wrong, but I’m scared now,” Brown said.Others in the crowd saw something different in the wreckage.Protesters destroyed property “because the system is broken,” said a young man who identified himself only by his nickname, Cash, and who said he had been in the streets during the violence. He dismissed the idea that the destruction would hurt residents of the largely black neighborhood.“They’re making money off of us,” he said angrily of the owners of the destroyed stores. He laughed when asked if he had joined in the looting or violence. “I didn’t break anything.”The protests that began Wednesday night and extended into Thursday were more violent than Tuesday’s, which included skirmishes between offices and protesters but no widespread property damage.Mayor Jacob Frey appealed for calm but the city’s response to the protests was quickly questioned as things started spiraling into violence. “If the strategy was to keep residents safe — it failed,” City Council Member Jeremiah Ellison, who is black, tweeted. “Prevent property damage — it failed.” On Thursday, he urged police to leave the scene of the overnight violence, saying their presence brings people into the streets.But Eric Kowalczyk, a police captain in Baltimore during the Freddie Gray riots in 2015, generally supported the Minneapolis police strategy to avoid confrontations with protesters when possible, saying heavy-handed police responses are only met with more violence.“Nobody wants to see their city on fire, but at the same time, you don’t want to see citizens injured by the very police department they are protesting,” he said.Protests have also spread to other U.S. cities. In New York City, protesters defied New York’s coronavirus prohibition on public gatherings Thursday, clashing with police, while demonstrators blocked traffic in downtown Denver. A day earlier, demonstrators had taken to the streets in Los Angeles and Memphis.Amid the violence in Minneapolis, a man was found fatally shot Wednesday night near a pawn shop, possibly by the owner, authorities said.Fire crews responded to about 30 intentionally set blazes, and multiple fire trucks were damaged by rocks and other projectiles, the fire department said. No one was hurt by the blazes.The city on Thursday released a transcript of the 911 call that brought police to the grocery store where Floyd was arrested. The caller described someone paying with a counterfeit bill, with workers rushing outside to find the man sitting on a van. The caller described the man as “awfully drunk and he’s not in control of himself.” Asked by the 911 operator whether the man was “under the influence of something,” the caller said: “Something like that, yes. He is not acting right.” Police said Floyd matched the caller’s description of the suspect.The U.S. Attorney’s Office and the FBI in Minneapolis said Thursday they were conducting “a robust criminal investigation” into the death. President Donald Trump has said he had asked an investigation to be expedited.The FBI is also investigating whether Floyd’s civil rights were violated.Chauvin, the officer who kneeled on Floyd’s neck, was fired Tuesday with three other officers involved in the arrest. The next day, the mayor called for Chauvin to be criminally charged. He also appealed for the activation of the National Guard.___Associated Press writers Steve Karnowski, Jeff Baenen and Doug Glass in Minneapolis, and Gretchen Ehlke in Milwaukee contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-protesters-set-minneapolis-police-station-afire/story-lXOtbRAijTLLCZdm36NKwJ.html
02-06-2020||World||Trump tries a new response after George Floyd’s death||It was the kind of personal statement expected from a president in response to the disturbing video of a black man gasping for help as a white policeman pinned him to the street by the neck. But it was a very different tone for President Donald Trump, who has often been silent in the face of white-on-black violence and has a long history of defending police.“I feel very, very badly,” Trump said Thursday of George Floyd’s death while handcuffed and in the custody of Minneapolis police. “That’s a very shocking sight.”Once more likely to hew to the “blue lives matter” mantra, Trump and his allies are questioning an officer’s conduct and calling for justice for Floyd. But some activists doubt that Trump has suddenly evolved on the issue of police brutality and instead see election-year political calculations.“This is the first race-tinged case that I’ve ever heard him address” as president, said the Rev. Al Sharpton, a civil rights activist and Trump critic who has known the president for decades. “So therefore he cannot be upset when people feel that it’s empty words because it is so out of character.”White House spokesman Judd Deere said Trump was taking the death seriously.“This has nothing to do with politics and is only about making sure justice is done, and anyone who suggests otherwise is only seeking to sow division and ignore the President’s unwavering support for the African-American community,” Deere said, citing Trump’s support for criminal justice reform legislation, Opportunity Zones and historically black colleges and universities.Trump has been silent on a number of high-profile police-involved killings, including that of Stephon Clark, a black man shot by Sacramento police in 2018.“This is something that is a local matter and that’s something that we feel should be left up to the local authorities,” then-White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the time.He has never addressed the 2014 death of Eric Garner, who was placed in a chokehold by police trying to arrest him for selling loose cigarettes. Video of the encounter was viewed millions of times online and Garner’s dying words, “I can’t breathe,” became a rallying cry for the Black Lives Matter movement. Trump has, however, invoked those words on several occasions to mock political rivals, even bringing his hands to his neck for dramatic effect.Trump has a long history of injecting himself into racially sensitive cases. In 1989, he took out full-page newspaper ads calling for the death penalty for the Central Park Five, five young men of color who were wrongly convicted of a brutal assault on a jogger. Trump has never apologized, telling reporters last year: “You have people on both sides of that.”Trump also spent years railing against NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick for kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial injustice and police brutality. And he has even appeared to advocate for the rougher treatment of people in police custody, speaking dismissively of the police practice of shielding the heads of handcuffed suspects as they are being placed in patrol cars.But Trump’s tone has changed in recent weeks as he has repeatedly expressed dismay at footage of the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, the 25-year-old black man fatally shot in February in Georgia while jogging.“You know, my heart goes out to the parents and the family and the friends,” he told reporters this month. “It’s a heartbreaking thing.”The president has notably left open the possibility of some other explanation, saying: “it could be something that we didn’t see on tape.”Trump and his allies have been even clearer on the death of Floyd, who can be heard and seen on tape pleading that he couldn’t breathe before he slowly stops talking and moving.Trump “was very upset when he saw that video,” White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said Thursday. “He wants justice to be served.”Trump’s conservative allies also rallied to the cause.Fox News host Sean Hannity said he is “a big supporter of law enforcement,” but expressed outrage Wednesday night, telling his audience: “The lack of training here is breathtaking.”“It defies common sense. It defies training. It defies arrest policies and procedures. There was no resistance,” echoed Bernie Kerik, the former New York police commissioner pardoned by Trump.“We got to get to the very bottom of how this poor individual was treated, and the death of him on the video itself is shocking from what I saw,” said Republican House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy.Even conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh, who once called Black Lives Matter a “terrorist group,” said Thursday that Floyd’s death was totally “unjustified” and he was “so mad.”The outpouring comes as the Trump campaign has sought to chip into the advantage Democrats have with black voters. The campaign hopes either to win enough black support to keep pivotal states such as Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin in play or minimize enthusiasm for Democratic rival Joe Biden. There could be a small window after Biden last week told a prominent black radio host that African Americans who back Trump “ain’t black,” a gaffe he later said he regretted.Trump and his allies have seized on that and other Biden statements, even though Biden, who served as vice president under the nation’s first black president, remains deeply popular among black voters, who helped him secure the Democratic nomination.Indeed, a recent Fox News poll found that just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of Trump, versus 75% who have a favorable view of Biden.Chris White, the longtime director of the Detroit Coalition Against Police Brutality, questioned the sincerity of Republicans’ response to the deaths of Arbery and Floyd. The White House and Department of Justice have long had the power to address these issues.“Any time we hear politicians speaking about dealing with police brutality in the middle of election year, it’s just meaningless rhetoric that has a hollow promise,” he said.Sharpton credited both the magnitude of outrage in response to Floyd’s death as well as the upcoming election for the changed approach. But he doubted many black voters will be swayed with an approach they may see as too little, too late.“It’s like a father that misses a kid’s graduation of high school, graduation of college,” he said. “He can’t be upset when the kid looks at him suspiciously when he’s there when he graduates with his Ph.D.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-tries-a-new-response-after-george-floyd-s-death/story-foAxL9xfePHKZeXDHrt6fN.html
02-06-2020||World||Officer who put knee on man’s neck should be charged, says Minneapolis mayor||The mayor of Minneapolis called Wednesday for criminal charges against the white police officer seen on video kneeling against the neck of a handcuffed black man who complained that he could not breathe and died in police custody.Based on the video, Mayor Jacob Frey said officer Derek Chauvin should be charged in the death of George Floyd. The footage by a bystander shows Chauvin with his knee on Floyd’s neck as Floyd gasps for breath on the ground with his face against the pavement. The officer does not move for at least eight minutes, even after Floyd stops speaking and moving.“I’ve wrestled with, more than anything else over the last 36 hours, one fundamental question: Why is the man who killed George Floyd not in jail?” said Frey, who is white.He later added: “I saw no threat. I saw nothing that would signal that this kind of force was necessary.”The day after Floyd died, Chauvin and three other officers were fired — an act that did not stem the flood of anger that followed the widely seen video shot on Memorial Day outside a convenience store.Protesters marched more than 2 miles Tuesday to the police precinct in that part of the city, with some damaging property and skirmishing with officers in riot gear who fired tear gas. A smaller protest was underway Wednesday afternoon outside the same precinct, with roughly a dozen officers behind barriers and a couple hundred protesters occasionally yelling at them and throwing objects.Another demonstration unfolded on the street outside Chauvin’s suburban home. An officer told protesters that Chauvin was not there. Red cans of paint were earlier spilled on his driveway, and someone wrote “murderer” in chalk at the end of his driveway. No one answered when an Associated Press reporter knocked on the door.Many activists, citizens and celebrities called for criminal charges before Frey did. But Floyd’s family and the community may have to wait months, if not years, before investigations are complete.Floyd family attorney Ben Crump, a prominent civil rights lawyer, called for peaceful protests.“We cannot sink to the level of our oppressors, and we must not endanger others during this pandemic,” he said in a statement. “We will demand and ultimately force lasting change by shining a light on treatment that is horrific and unacceptable and by winning justice.”Police Chief Medaria Arradondo, who rose to the top job after his predecessor was forced out following the 2017 shooting of an unarmed white woman by a black Minneapolis officer, urged protesters to “be respectful.” He said he was working to change the department’s culture.“One incident can significantly bring people to doubt that,” he said.The chief defended the department’s use of tear gas to break up Tuesday night’s protests, saying officers used it only after some people broke into a secure area that gave them access to squad cars and weapons.Gov. Tim Walz and Minnesota’s two top law enforcement officials — Attorney General Keith Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington, both black — promised a thorough, transparent investigation. But Walz and Ellison didn’t endorse the mayor’s call to immediately charge the officer, saying the legal process needs to play out.“I understand the emotions are running high, and I think it’s important for the mayor to channel the emotion of the people who he represents. But I think it is critical that we adhere very closely to the facts and the law and the normal process,” Ellison said.The Hennepin County Attorney’s Office, which would prosecute any state charges, issued a statement saying that Floyd’s death had “outraged us and people across the country” and that the case “deserves the best we can give.”The FBI was investigating whether officers willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights.Floyd’s death and that of Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia have reopened the divide between minority communities and police that grew to a national uproar following the 2014 killings of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray and others.Speaking to reporters at Cape Canaveral, Florida, President Donald Trump called the death in Minneapolis “a very, very sad event” and said his administration was going to “look at it.” Later, he tweeted that he had asked for the federal investigation be expedited.Democrat Joe Biden said Floyd’s death was “part of an ingrained, systemic cycle of injustice that still exists in this country” and “cuts at the very heart of our sacred belief that all Americans are equal in rights.”It also “sends a very clear message to the black community and black lives that are under threat every single day,” Biden added, saying he was glad the mayor and the police department fired the officers, “but I don’t think that’s enough.”A 2017 Pew Research Center study found that police think the public does not understand the risks they face. A more recent study from September showed police were considered more trustworthy than Congress, but only 33% of black adults and half of Hispanics say they believe officers treat racial and ethnic groups equally.Shocking videos of black men dying continue to emerge during the pandemic, which is hitting communities of color harder than white communities. Floyd himself had been laid off from his nightclub security job in the pandemic, a friend told the AP. Police say Floyd matched the description of someone who tried to pay with a counterfeit bill at the convenience store.It was unclear why Floyd was arrested in such a physical way for what would have been a low-level crime. Police in most large cities have backed away from certain arrests to guard against further spread of the virus. The officers in the video were not wearing masks.A Minneapolis Fire Department report shows that paramedics moved Floyd from the scene, and two fire crew members got into the ambulance to help. Medics were doing chest compressions and other lifesaving measures on an “unresponsive, pulseless male,” the report said. Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital.An autopsy will be performed to determine if the neck compression led to his death.News accounts show Chauvin was one of six officers who fired their weapons in the 2006 death of Wayne Reyes, who police said pointed a sawed-off shotgun at officers after stabbing two people. Chauvin also shot and wounded a man in 2008 during a struggle after Chauvin and his partner responded to a reported domestic assault. Police did not immediately respond to a request for Chauvin’s service record.In calling for charges, the mayor contrasted Floyd’s death with others involving police that turned on split-second decisions by officers.“We are not talking about a split-second decision that was made incorrectly,” Frey said. “There’s somewhere around 300 seconds in those five minutes — every one of which that officer could have turned back, every second of which he could have removed his knee from George Floyd’s neck.”___Long reported from Washington.
