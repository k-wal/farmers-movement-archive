07-06-2020||World||World reaches 4,00,000 coronavirus deaths, at least 6.9 million infected||The confirmed global death toll from the COVID-19 virus reached at least 400,000 fatalities on Sunday, a day after the government of Brazil broke with standard public health protocols by ceasing to publish updates of the number of deaths and infections in the hard-hit South American country.Worldwide, at least 6.9 million people have been infected by the virus, according to Johns Hopkins University, whose aggregated tally has become the main worldwide reference for monitoring the disease. Its running counter says United States leads the world with nearly 110,000 confirmed virus-related deaths. Europe as a whole has recorded more than 175,000 since the virus emerged in China late last year.Health experts, however, believe that the John Hopkins tally falls short of showing the true tragedy of the pandemic.Many governments have struggled to produce statistics that can reasonably be considered as true indicators of the pandemic given the scarcity of diagnostic tests especially in the first phase of the crisis. Authorities in Italy and Spain, with over 60,000 combined deaths, have acknowledged that their death count is larger than the story the numbers tell.Brazil’s government has stopped publishing a running total of coronavirus deaths and infections; critics say it’s an attempt to hide the true toll of the disease.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro went as far as to tweet on Saturday that his country’s disease totals are “not representative” of Brazil’s current situation, insinuating that the numbers were actually overestimating the spread of the virus.Critics of Bolsonaro, who has repeatedly clashed with health experts over the seriousness of the disease and has threatened to take Brazil out of the World Health Organization, said the decision was a maneuver by the hardman-style leader to hide the depths of crisis.Brazil’s last official numbers recorded over 34,000 virus-related deaths, the third-highest toll in the world behind the U.S. and Britain. It reported nearly 615,000 infections, putting it second behind the U.S.After Bolsonaro stoked his clash with health experts, Pope Francis cautioned people in countries emerging from lockdown to keep following authorities’ rules on social distancing, hygiene and limits on movement.“Be careful, don’t cry victory, don’t cry victory too soon,” Francis said. “Follow the rules. They are rules that help us to avoid the virus getting ahead” again.The Argentine-born pontiff has also expressed dismay that the virus is still claiming many lives, especially in Latin America.Francis was clearly delighted to see several hundred people gathered below his window in St. Peter’s Square on Sundays for the pope’s noon blessing after Italy eased its restrictions on public gatherings.Many counties like the U.S. and Britain insist that they can ease restrictions before having stalled their outbreaks.In the U.S., the virus churns on underneath the unrest provoked by the death of George Floyd and increasingly directed at President Donald Trump’s handling of the protests.On Sunday, the U.K. revealed that places of worship can reopen from June 15 — but only for private prayer.Worries have surfaced over the past couple of weeks that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is easing the restrictions too soon, with new infections potentially still running at 8,000 a day. As things stands, nonessential shops, including department stores, are due to reopen on June 15.Professor John Edmunds, who attends meetings of the British government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said the epidemic “is definitely not all over” and that there is an “awful long way to go.”In France, the government announced that from Tuesday, it will ease restrictions limiting travel from the French mainland to overseas territories in the Caribbean and Indian Ocean.Spain is preparing to take another step forward in the scaling back of its containment with Madrid and Barcelona opening the interiors of restaurants with reduced seating on Monday.In Turkey, Istanbul residents flocked to the city’s shores and parks on the first weekend with no lockdown, prompting a reprimand from the health minister.Russia remained troubling, with nearly 9,000 new cases over the past day, roughly in line with numbers reported over the past week.Pakistan is pushing toward 100,000 confirmed infections as medical professionals plead for more controls and greater enforcement of social distancing directives. But Prime Minister Imran Khan said a full shutdown would devastate a failing economy.India confirmed 9,971 new coronavirus cases in another biggest single-day spike, a day before it prepares to reopen shopping malls, hotels and religious places after a 10-week lockdown.China has reported its first non-imported case in two weeks, an infected person on the island of Hainan off the southern coast.___Frances D’Emilio in Rome, Pan Pylas in London and AP journalists around the world contributed to this report.___Follow AP pandemic coverage at http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-reaches-4-00-000-coronavirus-deaths-at-least-6-9-million-infected/story-ZYySNzrxm51kJap7zOR98N.html
07-06-2020||World||China defends fight against coronavirus, says US was informed on January 4||China on Sunday defended its actions on fighting the coronavirus outbreak in a lengthy white paper which said Beijing “wasted no time” in sharing information on the virus with the WHO and that the Chinese Centre for Disease Control informed its US counterpart about the unknown virus as early as January 4.The coronavirus disease first emerged from the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year before rapidly spreading within the country and then globally.National health commission, Ma Xiaowei, said: “The Chinese government did not delay or cover up anything”.“Instead, we have immediately reported virus data and relevant information about the epidemic to the international community and made an important contribution to the prevention and control of the epidemic around the world,” Ma said at the release of the official document in Beijing on Sunday.Also read: The first move on the India-China chessboard | HT EditorialUS president Donald Trump’s administration has accused China of cover-ups and lack of transparency regarding the pandemic. The US president has also made efforts to launch an international probe into the origin of the virus.Beijing has repeatedly denied Trump’s allegations, saying it kept the world informed from the start, and adding that it was in favour of a WHO-led probe after the pandemic was over.The white paper, an official government document, said researchers from a high-level expert team organised by China’s top national health body confirmed that the coronavirus was transmissible among humans at midnight on January 19.The report, which is more than 60 pages long, praised China’s success in reducing the daily increase in new cases to single digits within about two months and the “decisive victory ... in the battle to defend Hubei Province and its capital city of Wuhan” in about three months.It said the medical cost of all the coronavirus patients in China totalled 1.35 billion yuan ($191 million) as of the end of May.Also read: China to firmly fight back against shifting of blame, rejects ‘politicization’ of Covid-19Until Saturday, China has reported 4,634 deaths and more than 83,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19.The document said it was on December 27 that the Hubei Provincial Hospital of Integrated Chinese and Western Medicine reported cases of pneumonia of unknown cause.By December 31, the Wuhan city health commission (WCHC) confirmed 27 cases and urged “…the public to stay away from enclosed public places with poor ventilation and venues where large crowds gathered. The commission also suggested the use of face masks when going out”.By January 5, laboratory tests ruled out respiratory pathogens as the cause of the pneumonia such as influenza, avian influenza, adenovirus, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus, and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus.The head of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention briefed his US counterpart by phone on the then-unknown virus as early as January 4, which was followed up by another phone conversation on January 8.The report credited Chinese President Xi Jinping with making the January 22 decision to lockdown Wuhan by cutting transportation links and banning people from leaving or entering the city.Speaking at the press conference, science and technology minister, Wang Zhigang said China will also strengthen international cooperation in future Covid-19 clinical vaccine trials, building on earlier collaboration in vaccine development.Xi said last month at the World Heath Assembly, the WHO’s governing body, that vaccines China’s develops will become a “global public good” once they are ready for use, and it will be China’s contribution to ensuring vaccine accessibility and affordability in developing countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-defends-fight-against-coronavirus-says-us-was-informed-on-january-4/story-Y03G2Pr8ZAamboHMb1dy5M.html
07-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Late lockdown in UK cost lot of lives, says expert||As the UK registered the second highest toll of 40,465 last week, an epidemiologist on a key government committee said on Sunday that ‘a lot of lives’ have been lost because the lockdown was imposed as late as March 23.John Edmunds, who is on the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) that provides scientific inputs to government decisions, believes that the lockdown in the UK should have been announced earlier. There have been 284,868 cases in the country so far.Edmunds said: “We should have gone into lockdown earlier. I think it would have been very hard to pull the trigger at that point but I wish we had - I wish we had gone into lockdown earlier. I think that has cost a lot of lives unfortunately.”But he told BBC that it would have been “hard to do it” earlier than March 23 because the data the Boris Johnson Government had in the early part of March and “our kind of situational awareness” was “really quite poor”.The Johnson government has come under considerable criticism for its responses in the early stages of the pandemic. Chief scientific advisor Patrick Vallance told MPs in March that a death toll of below 20,000 would be a ‘good result’ but the latest figure is double that estimate.Health secretary Matt Hancock, however, responded to the criticism by insisting that the government had made the “right decisions at the right time” and had been guided by a “balance” of scientific opinions on the issue.Asked if he was sure that the lockdown’s timing had not cost lives, he said: “I am sure, as I keep looking back on that period, I’m sure that taking into account everything we knew at that moment - my view is that we made the right decisions at the right time.”“There’s a broad range on SAGE of scientific opinion and we were guided by the science which means guided by the balance of that opinion as expressed to ministers...That’s the right way for it to have been done”, Hancock added.The Observer described the government’s response to the pandemic ‘dire’, calling for a public inquiry.It said in an editorial on Sunday: “This is a pandemic that has tested the public health response of governments in every corner of the world. But the UK has performed poorly on any measure: the death toll is now more than double what the government’s scientific advisers said would be a ‘good outcome’, and, at this point, it has one of the worst excess deaths rates in the world”.“Yet the prime minister has offered no apology for the serious mistakes the government has made so far: its haphazard procurement of protective equipment for frontline workers; the tragedy it did too little to prevent unfolding in Britain’s care homes; its unforgivably slow efforts to build up testing capacity”.“All along, there have been worrying signs that this was a government prepared to put politics above pandemic management; in the past two weeks, that sense has only intensified as Johnson has rushed in multiple lockdown relaxations in what looks like an attempt to distract from the rule-breaking of his top adviser”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-late-lockdown-in-uk-cost-lot-of-lives-says-expert/story-WPP7wyf0flYtBnSMUcZsZJ.html
07-06-2020||World||Plant-derived drug under testing, cancer drug shows promise: Covid-19 vaccine update||The need to develop a vaccine against Covid-19 is getting more urgent by the day as coronavirus cases across the globe head towards another grim milestone. With 7 million people infected worldwide and 4 lakh people dead, experts and scientists are ramping up effort to develop a potential Covid-19 vaccine.  While experts at the University of Oxford, in collaboration with British-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca, have pushed their drug contender to the clinical trial phase, another popular candidate, remdesivir, is also seen as one of the top contenders after countries like the US and India approved its emergency usage in treating Covid-19 patients. Also read: India’s Covid-19 tally reaches 246,628, death toll at 6,929Ten vaccines against Covid-19 are in the clinical trials phase. Researchers at the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca hope to have the first phase 3 data in hand this summer.As per a Lancet report, “the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have embraced a recombinant vaccine called AZD1222 to achieve a similar effect, engineering a chimpanzee adenovirus to carry DNA for the spike antigen,” the report read.Here are the latest developments around Covid-19 vaccine: • AstraZeneca Plc has approached rival drugmaker Gilead Sciences Inc about a potential merger, news agency Reuters reported citing Bloomberg News. Both companies are leading the drug industry’s efforts to fight the coronavirus pandemic. AstraZeneca’s cancer drug has also shown promising results in the fight against Covid-19• Gilead’s antiviral drug remdesivir is the first drug to lead to improvement in Covid-19 patients in formal clinical trials. • Japan’s Fujifilm Holdings Corp said its research on Avigan as a potential treatment for Covid-19 may drag on until July.Also read: India now fifth worst-affected by Covid-19, surpasses Spain• On June 4, AstraZeneca said it had doubled manufacturing capacity for its potential coronavirus vaccine to 2 billion doses in two deals involving Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates that guarantee early supply to lower-income countries. • AstraZeneca has also entered into an agreement with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) to produce the vaccine currently under trial at the University of Oxford on a mass scale, if successful.• Indian drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd said on Friday it was testing a plant-derived drug, AQCH, for the potential treatment of Covid-19 as part of a mid-stage trial, with results expected by October.• Moderna’s mRNA-1273 is another contender in the race. It entered into clinical trials just 66 days after SARS-CoV-2 was first sequenced. In India, the Covid-19 tally touched 246,628. While 119,292 patients have recovered from the deadly contagion in the country, 6,929 people have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-covid-19-vaccine-updates-plant-derived-aqch-drug-under-testing-astrazeneca-s-cancer-drug-shows-promise/story-VM3NkHA4ovlIPbLUC8HUQM.html

Around 47% said they disapproved of how the government is handling the pandemic. Forty-four percent said they are dissatisfied with Johnson’s performance as prime minister, while backing for opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer has gone up to 40%, the newspaper reported.A separate poll conducted by Survation on Wednesday indicated that support for the Tories fell to 41% from 45%, while backing for Labour rose by 5 percentage points to 39%, the Daily Mail said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polls-say-support-for-uk-pm-boris-johnson-drops-says-report/story-2AWqsnW2GTvPmqQzQv9RaI.html
07-06-2020||World||George Floyd death: Largely peaceful protests against police brutality in US||Massive protests against police brutality nationwide capped a week that began in chaos but ended with largely peaceful expressions that organizers hope will sustain their movement.Saturday’s marches featured few reports of problems in scenes that were more often festive than tense. Authorities were not quick to release crowd size estimates, but it was clear tens of thousands of people — and perhaps hundreds of thousands — turned out nationally.Wearing masks and urging fundamental change, protesters gathered in dozens of places from coast to coast while mourners in North Carolina waited for hours to glimpse the golden coffin carrying the body of native son George Floyd, the black man whose death at the hands of Minneapolis police has galvanized the expanding movement.Collectively, it was perhaps the largest one-day mobilization since Floyd died May 25 and came as many cities lifted curfews imposed following initial spasms of arson, assaults and smash-and-grab raids on businesses. Authorities have softened restrictions as the number of arrests plummeted.Demonstrations also reached four other continents, ending in clashes in London and Marseille, France. In the US, Seattle police used flash bang devices and pepper spray to disperse protesters hurling rocks, bottles and what authorities said were “improvised explosives” that had injured officers, just a day after city leaders temporarily banned one kind of tear gas. Around midnight in Portland, a firework was thrown over the fence at the Justice Center, injuring a Multnomah County deputy, Portland police Lt. Tina Jones said. Smith said police had declare an unlawful assembly and were making arrests.The largest US demonstration appeared to be in Washington, where protesters flooded streets closed to traffic. On a hot, humid day, they gathered at the Capitol, on the National Mall and in neighborhoods. Some turned intersections into dance floors. Tents offered snacks and water.Pamela Reynolds said she came seeking greater police accountability.“The laws are protecting them,” said the 37-year-old African American teacher. The changes she wants include a federal ban on police chokeholds and a requirement that officers wear body cameras.At the White House, which was fortified with new fencing and extra security measures, chants and cheers were heard in waves. President Donald Trump, who has urged authorities to crack down on unrest, downplayed the demonstration, tweeting: “Much smaller crowd in D.C. than anticipated.”Elsewhere, the backdrops included some of the nation’s most famous landmarks. Peaceful marchers mingled with motorists as they crossed the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Cars had been cleared from the Brooklyn Bridge as protesters streamed into Manhattan on a day that New York police relaxed enforcement of a curfew that has led to confrontations. They walked the boulevards of Hollywood and a Nashville, Tennessee, street famous for country music-themed bars and restaurants.Many protesters wore masks — a reminder of the danger that the protests could exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus.Roderick Sweeney, who is black, said the large turnout of white protesters waving signs that said “Black Lives Matter” in San Francisco sent a powerful message.“We’ve had discussions in our family and among friends that nothing is going to change until our white brothers and sisters voice their opinion,” said Sweeney, 49.A large crowd of Seattle medical workers, many in lab coats and scrubs, marched to City Hall, holding signs reading, “Police violence and racism are a public health emergency” and “Nurses kneel with you, not on you” — a reference to how a white officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes.Atop a parking garage in downtown Atlanta, a group of black college band alumni serenaded protesters with a tuba-heavy mix of tunes. Standing within earshot, business owner Leah Aforkor Quaye said it was her first time hitting the streets.“This makes people so uncomfortable, but the only way things are happening is if we make people uncomfortable,” said Quaye, who is black.In Raeford, North Carolina, a town near Floyd’s birthplace, people lined up outside a Free Will Baptist church, waiting to enter in small groups. At a private memorial service, mourners sang along with a choir. A large photo of Floyd and a portrait of him adorned with an angel’s wings and halo were displayed at the front of the chapel.“It could have been me. It could have been my brother, my father, any of my friends who are black,” said Erik Carlos of nearby Fayetteville. “It made me feel very vulnerable at first.”Floyd’s body will go to Houston, where he lived before Minneapolis, for another memorial in the coming days.Protesters and their supporters in public office say they’re determined to turn the outpouring into change, notably overhauling policing policies. Many marchers urged officials to “defund the police.”Theresa Bland, 68, a retired teacher and real estate agent protesting at the Ohio Statehouse in Columbus, envisioned a broader agenda.“I’m looking at affordable housing, political justice, prison reform,” she said.Congressional Democrats are preparing a sweeping package of police reforms, which is expected to include changes to immunity provisions and creating a database of use-of-force incidents. Revamped training requirements are planned, too — among them, a ban on chokeholds.The prospects of reforms clearing a divided Congress are unclear.Back in North Carolina, the Rev. Christopher Stackhouse recounted the circumstances of Floyd’s death for the congregation.“It took 8 minutes and 46 seconds for him to die,” Stackhouse said at the memorial service. “But it took 401 years to put the system in place so nothing would happen.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-largely-peaceful-protests-against-police-brutality-in-us/story-cj0N4zE583I9TI8CiYC4mN.html
07-06-2020||World||Sri Lanka holds mock poll to test Covid-19 guidelines for parliamentary election||Sri Lanka’s election commission has held a mock poll in the southern Galle district to test the Covid-19 health guidelines and its preparedness for the parliamentary polls likely to be held between late July and mid August.The parliamentary polls were initially to be held on April 25, but had to be postponed due to the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic which prompted the authorities to announce a nationwide lockdown from March 20.Later, the election commission shifted the date to June 20. It was again deemed not suitable in view of the raging Covid-19 pandemic, which has claimed 11 lives and infected over 1,900 people in the island nation. A majority of the patients have been cured and discharged from hospitals.Some 200 voters from the Ambalangoda polling division in Galle district were chosen to ‘vote’ at the mock poll, according to an official.“We wanted to learn from the exercise so that the lessons can be applied at the real election when it happens,” senior election commission official Saman C Ratnayake told reporters at the Buddhist temple hall which was used for the mock poll.The selected voters were given instructions at their homes on Saturday and were asked to bring along a pen to mark the vote while wearing a face mask.The election commission said they had formulated guidelines to conduct the polls in close cooperation with the health authorities.Election chief Mahinda Deshapriya said the guidelines were revolving around social distancing, washing hands and wearing face masks.At the mock poll, attention was given to the time it takes to cast a vote while sticking to the health guidelines.The poll date to elect a 225-member parliament is yet to be announced. According to officials, it is likely to be held anytime between late July and mid August.The opposition parties and civil society groups have challenged the holding of the election in the midst of health risks posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.Over 16 million voters are eligible to vote to elect 196 members under proportional representation and a further 29 members on national cumulative votes of each party based on proportional representation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sri-lanka-holds-mock-poll-to-test-covid-19-guidelines-for-parliamentary-election/story-2ZqYLYlvaT9gbmSiRVtN6L.html
07-06-2020||World||Protesters topple Confederate statue in Virginia capital||A small group of demonstrators toppled a statue of a Confederate general in the the former capital of the Confederacy late Saturday, following a day of largely peaceful protests in the Virginia city.The statue of Gen. Williams Carter Wickham was pulled from its pedestal in Monroe Park, a Richmond police spokeswoman said. She said she did not know if there were any arrests or damage done to the statue.A rope had been tied around the Confederate statue, which has stood since 1891, The Richmond Times-Dispatch reported, adding that someone urinated on the statue after it was pulled down. Photos and video from the newspaper showed the what appeared to be red paint splashed or sprayed on the statue.In 2017, some of Wickham’s descendants urged the city to remove the statue.Confederate monuments are a major flashpoint in Virginia and elsewhere in the South. Confederate memorials began coming down after a white supremacist killed nine black people at a Bible study in a church in South Carolina in 2015 and then again after the deadly white nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017.Last week, Gov. Ralph Northam announced that a state-owned statue of former Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee would be removed from its perch on the famed Monument Avenue “as soon as possible.”The Lee statue is one of five Confederate monuments along Monument Avenue, a prestigious residential street and National Historic Landmark district. Monuments along the avenue have been rallying points during protests in recent days over Floyd’s death, and they have been tagged with graffiti, including messages that say “End police brutality” and “Stop white supremacy.”Richmond Mayor Levar Stoney last week announced plans to seek the removal of the other Confederate monuments along Monument Avenue, which include statues of Confederate President Jefferson Davis and Confederate Gens. Stonewall Jackson and J.E.B. Stuart. Those statues sit on city land, unlike the Lee statue, which is on state property.Stoney said he would introduce an ordinance July 1 to have the statues removed. That’s when a new law goes into effect, which was signed earlier this year by Northam, that undoes an existing state law protecting Confederate monuments and instead lets local governments decide their fate.Wickham’s statue stood in Monroe Park, about a mile away from the Lee statue and surrounded by the Virginia Commonwealth University campus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-topple-confederate-statue-in-virginia-capital/story-cGjMeIGhTsTFfMeezTVKbO.html
07-06-2020||World||China to firmly fight back against shifting of blame, rejects ‘politicization’ of Covid-19||China lambasted suggestions that it hid information about the coronavirus outbreak, saying in a newly published white paper that it has acted transparently and informed the world of developments in a timely manner.“Some foreign politicians and media have presumed guilt for the origin of the virus, put labels on the virus and politicized the epidemic,” Xu Lin, head of State Council Information Office, said at a briefing in Beijing Sunday. “The fabricated assumptions -- like the ‘China origins of the virus,’ ‘China concealed the virus’ and ‘it’s China’s responsibility’ -- are utterly baseless, unreasonable and disrespectful of science.”With almost 400,000 deaths globally, the Covid-19 pandemic has become a point of tension in China’s relationship with a number of countries, most notably America. President Donald Trump has repeatedly faulted China for having failed to contain the coronavirus when addressing the outbreak in the US, which now leads the world in both infections and deaths.China has adamantly defended its actions. It’s also sent medical supplies and doctors to countries battling infections, with President Xi Jinping pledging to make any Chinese-developed vaccine a “global public good.” At the same time, Beijing has sought to cast doubt on the theory that the virus originated in China, with a foreign ministry official having promoted conspiracy theories that linked the outbreak to the U.S. military.The white paper published Sunday by the State Council Council Information Office describes as a “calculated slur” accusations that China concealed information about the virus or that it didn’t disclose the actual number of deaths. It also says Beijing shared information in “clear and unambiguous terms” but that this was ignored by certain countries, which now seek to blame China for their own failures.“While certain countries madly defame China with every conceivable means to shed their own responsibilities, China must firmly fight back against the shifting of blame,” Ma Zhaoxu, deputy foreign minister, said at the briefing.Though neither the white paper nor any of the Chinese officials who spoke at the briefing mentioned the U.S. by name, the criticism levied Sunday did appear to address Washington’s actions.Trump and US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo have suggested a link between the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which runs a laboratory that studies dangerous pathogens in the city where the virus first emerged, and the outbreak. Pompeo said earlier this month that there was “enormous evidence” to trace the virus back to the laboratory.China has dismissed the allegation as “pure fabrication” and characterized U.S. assertions as an election-year strategy to deflect attention from the U.S.’s poor handling of its own outbreak.Meanwhile, the white paper pledges that China will continue to supply the international market with materials to fight the outbreak, including pharmaceutical goods, daily necessities and other supplies. The nation will continue to open its markets, expand imports and outbound investment, and contribute further to other countries’ fight against the virus and to a stable world economy.Deputy Foreign Minister Ma also argued that China’s relationship with most countries has actually become “more stabilized” during the pandemic. “The relationship with our friends is closer and our circle of friends has expanded,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-firmly-fight-back-against-shifting-of-blame-rejects-politicization-of-covid-19/story-mJCi7BhDOLoaGfzsObAl3N.html
07-06-2020||World||Shanghai Junshi Biosciences in human tests for coronavirus antibody drug||Shanghai Junshi Biosciences has started an early-stage study in China to test a potential antibody treatment against the coronavirus in uninfected people, official paper Liberation Daily said on its online channel on Sunday.The experimental drug, JS016, is also expected to begin human study in the United States in the second quarter of this year, through collaboration with Eli Lilly and Co.Junshi is among a few biotech firms and research institutes backed by global pharmaceutical giants to work on antibody-based therapies to help those infected with the fast-spreading new coronavirus, which has killed nearly 400,000 globally.The company hopes that its antibody, isolated from recovered patients’ blood and engineered by researchers, can also protect healthy people with high infection risk, such as medical workers and the elderly, from getting the virus, said Feng Hui, chief operating officer of Junshi. But the product can be much more expensive than a vaccine, a more commonly used preventive medicine for which multiple candidates are being tested, as Junshi’s antibody drug is expected to contain larger amounts of costly proteins in one dose than a vaccine, Feng said. “Vaccines and antibodies have their own intended consumers and they cannot replace each other,” Feng said in an interview with Reuters before the announcement.“Vaccines are cheap and suitable for nationwide immunization, but older people with relatively weak immunity may not have as robust a response to vaccines as healthy adults and children,” Feng said. “Antibodies can better protect those people from the virus.”To make the drug, Junshi has been placing orders with overseas suppliers for materials and items such as specialised vials 12 months prior to delivery, instead of the usual six months, for fear that the virus outbreak would further disrupt logistics and supply chain bottlenecks.Although further study is needed to determine how much protein to put in one dose, Feng said Junshi’s manufacturing capacity and access to key supplies allow it to make enough doses to serve 100,000 people “with absolutely no problem” by the end of the year, based on one gram of protein in a shot for one person.However, Feng cautioned that it remains uncertain whether they can find enough participants to use the drug in later-stage, larger-scale human tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/shanghai-junshi-biosciences-in-human-tests-for-coronavirus-antibody-drug/story-GjtLqRRyBpOkQJXftUuQZK.html
07-06-2020||World||Fujifilm says Covid-19 drug research may drag on into July||Fujifilm Holdings Corp’s research on Avigan as a potential treatment for Covid-19 may drag on until July, the company said on Sunday, a further setback in the Japanese firm’s race to find a vaccine.“There is a possibility that clinical trials will continue in July,” a Fujifilm spokesman said, responding to a Nikkei report that any approval will be delayed until July or later, due to a lack of patients for trials.After the government of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gave up on getting approval for the drug by the end of May, the aim was to complete clinical trials this month.But researchers have only been able to get around 70% of the patients needed for the trials, and because it takes 28 days to get results, the process will continue until at least July, the Nikkei business daily said, citing an unnamed source.The spokesman said Fujifilm does not make public details of the progress of clinical trials but it has expanded the number of medical institutions that are cooperate in the trials. “We aim to complete clinical trials as soon as possible.”Drugmakers around the world are scrambling to develop a vaccine for the new coronavirus, which has infected nearly 7 million people globally, while the disease it causes, Covid-19, has killed nearly 400,000.Many countries are focusing on drugs like Gilead Sciences Inc’s antiviral remdesivir and some are using the anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, touted by U.S. President Donald Trump. Abe’s government has championed Japanese candidate Avigan, also known as Favipiravir.Countries that have succeeded in curbing infections have sometimes paradoxically found it difficult to sustain clinical trials because of dwindling sample sizes for patients.Japan has avoided the explosive outbreaks seen in some other nations, with about 17,000 infections, and the number of daily infection has been falling, according to public broadcaster NHK and the health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fujifilm-says-covid-19-drug-research-may-drag-on-into-july/story-St527qEEHQlB71PvEOuS3N.html

The total count of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Brazil - a Latin American country - has shot past 6,72,000, more than anywhere outside the United States.Late on Saturday, Brazil reported 27,075 new confirmed infections and 904 related deaths since its Friday update.Brazil reported more new cases and deaths from Covid-19 than any other country on four consecutive days this week.Fatalities in the Latin American country are rising rapidly and it may overtake the United Kingdom to have the second-largest number of deaths in the world.Globally, death toll from the coronavirus disease is approaching 4,00,000. The number of deaths linked to Covid-19 in just five months is now equal to the number of people who die annually from malaria, one of the world’s most deadly infectious diseases.The first Covid-19 death was reported on January 10 in Wuhan, China, but it was early April before the death toll passed 1,00,000. It took 23 days to go from 3,00,000 to 4,00,000 deaths. Brazil, with about 210 million people, is the globe’s seventh most populous nation.Meanwhile, Brazil’s health ministry removed the data from a website that had documented the Covid-19 pandemic over time and by state and municipality. The ministry also stopped giving a total count of confirmed cases.President Jair Bolsonaro defended the move. “The cumulative data ... does not reflect the moment the country is in,” he said on Twitter, citing a note from the ministry. “Other actions are underway to improve the reporting of cases and confirmation of diagnoses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-leads-surge-as-global-covid-19-cases-near-7-million/story-1u6igHw5PKFERChHDzoSfL.html
07-06-2020||World||The Great Diamond Glut: Miners stuck with gems worth billions||In one of the world’s biggest diamond vaults, hidden inside a nondescript office compound on the dusty outskirts of Botswana’s capital, the precious stones just keep piling up.Owner De Beers, which mines and auctions most of its gems in the southern African nation, has barely sold any rough diamonds since February. Neither has Russian rival Alrosa PJSC. Now, as the coronavirus restrictions that froze the global industry for months begin to lift, the unsold diamonds present a dilemma: how to reduce billions of dollars’ worth of stocks without undermining the nascent recovery.The pandemic has devastated the diamond world. Jewelry stores closed their doors, India’s cutting and polishing artisans were forced to stay home and De Beers had to cancel its March sale because buyers couldn’t travel to view the merchandise.De Beers and Alrosa have moved to defend their market. The miners refused to cut prices, instead allowing buyers unprecedented freedom to renege on contracts to buy stones. They’ve also reduced production in an effort to control stock levels. Yet the diamonds keep piling up.The five biggest producers are probably sitting on excess inventories worth about $3.5 billion, according to Gemdax, a specialist advisory firm. The figure could reach $4.5 billion by the end of the year, or about one-third of annual rough-diamond production.“They’ve tried to restrict rough-diamond supply to protect the market and protect value,” said Gemdax partner Anish Aggarwal. “The question will be, how does this destocking occur? Can miners destock and keep protecting the market?”After being forced to cancel the March event, De Beers managed to hold a sale in May but didn’t announce the results like it usually does. According to people familiar with the situation, the sale yielded about $35 million. Last year that sale was $416 million.The next big test for the industry comes later this month, with De Beers’s next sale. The company is going out of its way to attract customers, including by allowing diamond viewings outside of Botswana. Buyers will still be allowed to refuse goods they’ve contracted to purchase.De Beers’s customers, some of whom had been deeply frustrated with some of the company’s sales methods in recent years, have welcomed its actions so far.Yet while De Beers and Alrosa have stood firm on pricing – even refusing approaches from customers offering to buy at special terms – smaller diamond producers have dropped their own prices, according to people familiar with the matter.Junior miners, some of which were fighting for survival even before the pandemic, have been offering steep discounts of as much as 25% in trading centers such as Antwerp, the people said. That could make it tough for the large companies to convince big buyers to come to the table.Diamond miners face “a double whammy of weak prices and a sharp decline in sales volumes on a scale reminiscent of the 2008-09 crisis,” Societe Generale analyst Sergey Donskoy said this week.“Can miners destock and keep protecting the market?”Managing supply has been a constant headache for the diamond industry ever since De Beers ended its monopoly. The company spent the early 2000s running down about $5 billion in stock, and industry inventories ballooned during the global financial crisis and again in 2013. Each time, selling down the stockpiles has caused buildups of polished diamonds, putting huge pressure on the cutters, traders and manufacturers that buy from them.It may be even harder this time around. Those middlemen of the industry were already struggling even before the pandemic, while retail is one of the sectors hardest hit by the virus measures.Alrosa said Friday that its diamond inventories could rise to 30 million carats by the end of the year, roughly the same as its annual production, but didn’t give a value. The company said it wants to cut those stocks to 15 million carats in three years.There are some signs of recovery. Chinese retailers are open again and India has allowed manufacturing to restart in the key Surat polishing hub, albeit at only 50% of capacity. The main Indian trading offices are allowed 10% of employees on site.Still, manufacturers bought heavily in the first two months of the year in anticipation of a recovery in the market. With cutting centers shut for the past two months, that inventory is expected to last until July or August. That’s left little need to buy now.“At this stage it’s hard to speculate on what the recovery curve will look like,” said Aggarwal. “What we’re not expecting is an immediate jump back in consumer demand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-great-diamond-glut-miners-stuck-with-gems-worth-billions/story-Qo1hrXhQ6T33rB40ClX00O.html

The protesters have clashed with the police, threw bombs and other things at them and even burned stuff.All this led to garbage lying around in the streets.An 18-year-old decided to do something about it. Antonio Gwynn Jr grabbed a broom, brought some garbage bags and started cleaning the streets of his hometown Buffalo, in the state of New York. He started at 2 am on Monday and did not stop for the next 10 hours, CNN reported.The word soon spread and Gwynn was all over the news. It was then, the CNN reported, that his community responded. One of the residents Matt Block decided to gift Gwynn his 2004 red Mustang convertible.Another local businessman extended a year of free auto insurance. A college in Buffalo offered Gwynn full scholarship where he plans to study business, CNN further reported.On Saturday, Buffalo saw pockets of looting after dark like many cities across the United States, where countless otherwise peaceful protests were staged in the wake of the death of George Floyd, a black man in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.Two Buffalo police officers were arraigned on Saturday on felony assault charges after a viral video showed them shoving an elderly protester who remains critically injured after falling at a march against racism.Officers Aaron Torgalski, 39, and Robert McCabe, 32, were part of a unit in tactical gear enforcing an 8 pm curfew on Thursday during the protest involving long-time community activist Martin Gugino, 75, Erie County District Attorney John Flynn said in a statement. Both pleaded not guilty to second-degree assault during the virtual arraignment before Buffalo City Court Judge Craig D Hannah. They were released on their own recognizance and are due back in court on July 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/18-year-old-cleans-street-after-protest-in-us-gets-car-and-scholarship-as-reward/story-b9s4UUp86EZnJdqIkvAykI.html
07-06-2020||World||Egypt’s president offers initiative to end conflict in war-torn Libya||Cairo [Egypt], June 7 (Xinhua/ANI): Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi announced on Saturday that Libyan Parliament Speaker Aguila Saleh and eastern-based military leader Khalifa Haftar have welcomed an initiative to end the military conflict in the neighbouring war-torn Libya.Sisi’s announcement came after a meeting with the visiting Libyan leaders in Cairo during which they discussed the recent developments of the ongoing war civil war in Libya.The initiative, dubbed Cairo Declaration, seeks a cease-fire between warring Libyan parties starting from June 8, a UN-supervised election of a Libyan presidential council and drafting a constitutional declaration to regulate elections for the later stage, Sisi said in a joint press conference with Haftar and Saleh.Under the initiative, foreign mercenaries would pull out from Libya and militias would dismantle and disarm, so that the Haftar-led Libyan National Army (LNA), in cooperation with the security apparatuses, can take over their security and military responsibilities in the country, according to the Egyptian president.Libya has been locked in a civil war since the ouster and killing of former leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.The situation escalated in 2014, splitting power between two rival governments: the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA) based in the capital Tripoli and another in the northeastern city of Tobruk allied with Haftar’s LNA.Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, France and Russia support Haftar’s LNA, while the GNA is backed by Turkey and Qatar, in addition to Italy.The eastern-based army launched a military campaign in April 2019, attempting to take over Tripoli from the UN-backed government.The fighting killed and injured hundreds of civilians and forced more than 150,000 others to flee their homes.According to Sisi, the initiative seeks to unify and regulate Libyan institutions to be able to perform their duties and guarantee fair and transparent distribution of Libyan resources to all citizens, hindering the monopoly of any extremist groups or militias over the country’s resources.“The initiative calls for respecting all relevant UN efforts and initiatives,” he noted, stressing that deteriorating security situation in Libya affects the security of neighboring states regionally and internationally.“The initiative will mark a beginning for a new stage towards the return of normal and safe life to Libya,” Sisi said, adding that it also calls for continuing the UN-sponsored talks by the 5+5 Libyan Joint Military Commission in Geneva.Sisi expressed Egypt’s aspiration for all countries and regional and international powers to support this step in order to end the Libyan crisis.He also called on the UN to assume its responsibility to invite all Libyan parties to the UN headquarters in Geneva to relaunch the political process.Speaking at the press conference, the speaker of the Libyan parliament said that the presidential council proposed by the initiative will consist of a president, two deputies, and a prime minister, adding that council’s term will be 18 months.“The council will not marginalize or exclude anyone,” he said, adding that “we will accelerate drafting of a constitution after which presidential and parliamentary elections will be held.”However, he stressed that the LNA is determined to expel the militias from the capital in order to “unify the Libyan institutions.”Hours after it was declared, Sisi’s initiative was welcomed by several countries including the U.S., Russia, France, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Jordan.Egyptian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sameh Shoukry reviewed on Saturday the elements of the initiative during phone calls with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Chairperson of the African Union Commission Moussa Faki, as well as foreign ministers of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Niger, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Jordan.Shoukry expressed Egypt’s keenness to coordinate with the countries concerned with the situation in Libya.He affirmed that Egypt will continue pursuing, along with friendly countries, a political solution in light of this initiative, and in the context of the objectives agreed upon in the framework of the conclusions of the Berlin process, with a view to achieving full stability in Libya.

07-06-2020||World||Floyd protests: Philadelphia Inquirer’s top editor Stan Wischnowski resigns over ‘Buildings Matter’ headline||A top editor in the United States resigned over a headline in connection with the George Floyd protests which have singed the country for more than 10 days.Stan Wischnowski, the Philadelphia Inquirer’s senior vice president and executive editor said on Saturday that he was stepping down. His resignation came after an uproar over the ‘Buildings Matter, Too’ headline lamenting damage to businesses amid turbulent protests denouncing police brutality against people of colour.The Inquirer had apologised for a “horribly wrong” decision to use the headline on a column Tuesday about looting and vandalism on the margins of protests.In its apology piece, The Inquirer that the headline “offensively riffed” on the Black Lives Matter movement. It called the error unacceptable.The note, however, said that the comparison between the loss of buildings and the lives of black Americans was not intended, and that the intent was ultimately irrelevant.It further described the headline-writing process followed at the news organisation, and vowed to change it after the error.The backlash came as The New York Times was widely criticised for publishing an opinion piece by US Senator Tom Cotton advocating the use of federal troops to quell the protests.About 30 members of the Inquirer’s 210-member editorial staff called in sick earlier this week, and black staff members angrily condemned the headline.The piece was written by architecture critic Inga Saffron, who worried that buildings damaged in violence over the past week could “leave a gaping hole in the heart of Philadelphia.”The Inquirer drew fresh scorn after it replaced that headline online with one that read, “Black Lives Matter. Do Buildings?” Eventually, the newspaper settled on “Damaging buildings disproportionately hurt the people protesters are trying to uplift.” Publisher and CEO Lisa Hughes said in a memo to staff that the headline was “offensive and inappropriate” and said the newspaper needed a more diverse workforce.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floyd-protests-philadelphia-inquirer-s-top-editor-stan-wischnowski-resigns-over-buildings-matter-headline/story-HDaDEOhGXGlZ7fIhMcAjfM.html

Based on data from the Taronga Conservation Society, a government agency in charge of several zoological parks, Sunday’s death would be the third in Australia this year.There were no fatalities last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-surfer-killed-in-shark-attack/story-4q4luJnE3DbPZFmhrf53uK.html
07-06-2020||World||Washington protesters express optimism after week on edge||On Monday, they were forcibly removed from the street by law enforcement. On Saturday, they danced.The tens of thousands of racially diverse demonstrators who flooded Washington to protest injustice and police brutality reshaped the mood of a city that has been on edge this week. Bursts of looting and violence early in the week prompted a dramatic clampdown by law enforcement that gave the nation’s capital the feeling of an occupied city, complete with military vehicles, helicopters buzzing low to the skyline and National Guard troops on patrol.But on Saturday, go-go music — a distinctive D.C. offshoot of funk — blared from a truck that looked more like a parade float. Impromptu dance parties popped up. A black man shared a fist bump with a black police officer. People used chalk to write messages of support on the street.The purpose of the protest was somber: to demand changes to police practices and pay homage to George Floyd, the black man killed by Minneapolis police. But the displays of levity, unfolding against the backdrop of damaged buildings marked with graffiti, amounted to a moment of catharsis for a city and nation in crisis.Some said they saw the beginning of a new movement.“This is us walking across the Pettus Bridge,” said Kendyll Myles, a 33-year-old project manager, referring to site of the iconic 1965 civil rights march in Selma, Alabama. “This is that type of awakening that our country needed.”The scene on Saturday was starkly different from earlier this week when law enforcement moved aggressively to push back protesters from a park in front of the White House. Within minutes, President Donald Trump walked across the park to appear before cameras at a church where he held up a Bible, but didn’t offer any prayers. The episode has been widely criticized.As demonstrations are expected to spill into another week, there are questions about whether the scope of the protests can become something more durable.Unlike the major Washington protests of the past, Saturday’s events weren’t strongly organized. In some cases, they were mini-marches that began in residential neighborhoods before converging on 16th Street, one of the major roads leading to the White House, where Trump spent the day without any public appearances.Many protestors carried signs urging participants to vote with the passion they brought to the streets. The Rev. Al Sharpton has said he’s organizing a March on Washington for late August that would energize voters heading into the fall presidential campaign.There were signs of cultural change. Those who led demonstrators in chants were almost exclusively people of color.Several white people who were approached for an interview demurred, saying that white people do enough talking and that this was a moment for their black and brown counterparts to have the spotlight and set the agenda.That’s one reason some black protestors said they thought this moment was different from previous demonstrations against police brutality. The fact that large numbers of white people would march alongside them fueled some hope that change might happen.“You can finally see it, the different races out here,” said Carl Sirls, a 26-year-old airline worker. “It’s not just black people. It’s not just white people. It’s everyone.”Pamela Reyolds said she hoped the massive size of the crowd and the diversity of the participants would help build momentum behind reforms including a ban on police chokeholds and a requirement for law enforcement to wear body cameras.“It took protest, it took rioting to happen,” the 37-year-old teacher said. “But I think they’re finally listening and they’re seeing that this is everybody’s fight.”There were still plenty of signs of anger on Saturday.Outside the FBI headquarters on Pennsylvania Avenue, a protestor moved close to a line of law enforcement and shouted they had no right to patrol the city. A few blocks away at the Trump International Hotel, protestors regularly shouted epithets at the building. One man used a bullhorn to ask police how they could justify guarding a building associated with a president who has backed aggression toward protestors.More broadly, the expressions of hope don’t mask the deeper challenges facing Washington or the nation.The city is home to one of the largest income inequality gaps in the country, according to the D.C. Fiscal Policy Institute. The racial divide is stark and has grown as longtime black neighborhoods have gentrified, sending home prices soaring. The coronavirus has taken a disproportionate toll on the black community.Mayor Muriel Bowser is under pressure to reduce funding for the city’s police and reinvest that money elsewhere. The local chapter of Black Lives Matter derided Bowser’s widely publicized move to paint Black Lives Matter across one of the streets near the White House.“This is performative and a distraction from her active counter organizing to our demands to decrease the police budget and invest in the community,” it said on Twitter.But as Bowser strolled that section of the street, the crowd in this overwhelmingly Democratic city burst into applause for a woman who is increasingly the subject of Trump’s ire. Art Lindy, a fifth-generation Washingtonian, shouted “Vice President Bowser” as she walked by.Bowser “has done an incredible job standing up to the face of federal power,” the 56-year-old construction manager said.A few blocks north, Jake Mathai was passing out free bottles of water to any demonstrator who needed relief from the heat and humidity. He said it was the least he could do for protestors and expressed particular admiration of younger people who showed up.“When I was 18, I was never doing this kind of thing,” the 36-year-old said. “These kids are going to be me in 18 years. But much better because I wasn’t doing this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-george-floyd-washington-protesters-express-optimism-after-week-on-edge-donald-trump-latest/story-2LZZae5EPDpYW9q10Y8u8J.html
07-06-2020||World||At least 23 police officers injured during Black Lives Matter protests in London||At least 23 police officers were injured in past several days during ongoing protests against racism and police brutality in London sparked by George Floyd’s murder in US’ Minneapolis city in late May, Jo Edwards, a police superintendent, said. Thousands of people marched through central London on Saturday, despite the ongoing coronavirus pandemic and calls by the authorities to refrain from gathering to avoid a sharp increase in infections.“We understand peoples’ passion to come and let their voice be heard, they protested largely without incident. Our officers have been professional and very restrained but there was a smaller group intent on violence towards police officers. Twenty-three officers have received injuries, doing their job, policing protest over the last few days, and that is totally unacceptable,” Edwards said, as quoted by a statement published on the London Metropolitan Police’s website.According to Edwards, 10 policemen were wounded and 14 people were detained during Saturday’s marches alone.The death of Floyd on May 25 has sparked a worldwide movement against police brutality, racism and social injustice, as a video showing a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd’s neck after the latter had been arrested was widely circulated online on the next day. Apart from the United States, mass protests have taken place in Greece, Italy the United Kingdom, Denmark, Germany, France, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, and other countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-23-police-officers-injured-during-black-lives-matter-protests-in-london/story-lSKTIawZzeV20YphLCbwNM.html

07-06-2020||World||Black Lives Matter protests mostly peaceful in Australia||Black Lives Matter protests across Australia proceeded mostly peacefully Saturday, as thousands of demonstrators in state capitals honored the memory of George Floyd and protested the deaths of indigenous Australians in custody.Organizers of the Sydney protest got a late reprieve when their appeal against a Friday ruling declaring the rally unauthorized was granted. The New South Wales Court of Appeal gave the green light just 12 minutes before the rally was scheduled to start, meaning those taking part could not be arrested.Up to 1,000 protesters had already gathered in the Town Hall area of downtown Sydney ahead of the decision.Floyd, a black man, died in handcuffs on May 25 while a Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on his neck even after he pleaded for air and stopped moving.In addition to Australia, protests were held in other countries as well on Saturday, including South Korea and Japan.In Sydney, there was one early scuffle when police removed a man who appeared to be a counter protester carrying a sign reading, “White Lives, Black Lives, All Lives Matter.”“If we don’t die from the (coronavirus) pandemic, then we will die from police brutality,” Sadique, who has a West African background and said he goes by only one name, said in Sydney.The rally appeared orderly as police handed out masks to protesters and other officials provided hand sanitizer.Bob Jones, 75, said it was worth the risk to rally for change despite the state’s chief health officer saying the event could help spread the coronavirus.“If a society is not worth preserving, then what are you doing? You’re perpetuating a nonsense,” Jones said.Crowds filled Victoria Square in Adelaide after police gave special permission for the event to proceed despite Covid-19 restrictions. The march through the southern Australian city was held after police Commissioner Grant Stevens approved the rally on Friday.“This is a unique and extraordinary event. There is a sentiment that suggests people should have a right to protest on significant matters,” Stevens said.In Brisbane, the Queensland state capital, organizers said about 30,000 people gathered, forcing police to shut down some major downtown streets. The protesters marched from King George Square, across the river to South Brisbane, where they demanded to have Australia’s Indigenous flag raised at the police station.State Environment Minister Leeanne Enoch encouraged Queenslanders to speak out.“Whether you’re talking about the US or right here in Australia, black lives matter,” she said. “Black lives matter today. Black lives matter every day.”A Maori group did a traditional haka, or war dance, during the Brisbane protest. The large crowd later marched to a local police precinct, some chanting, “They say justice, we say murder.”On Friday, 2,000 demonstrators gathered in Canberra, the country’s capital, to remind Australians that the racial inequality underscored by Floyd’s death was not unique to the United States.“Australians have to understand that what’s been going on in the United States has been happening here for a long time,” said Matilda House, an elder of the Ngambri-Ngunnawal family group, the original settlers of the Canberra region.A demonstrator who interrupted House, arguing that the rally’s focus should be on “what’s happening in the United States” rather than Australia’s colonial history, was shouted down in a heated confrontation with several protesters. The demonstrator eventually followed the crowd’s advice to leave.Indigenous Australians make up 2% of the the country’s adult population, but 27% of the prison population. They are also the most disadvantaged ethnic minority in Australia and have higher-than-average rates of infant mortality and poor health, as well as shorter life expectancies and lower levels of education and employment than other Australians.Protesters gathered in South Korea’s capital for the second straight day to denounce Floyd’s death.Wearing masks and black shirts, dozens of demonstrators marched through a commercial district in downtown Seoul amid a police escort, carrying signs such as “George Floyd Rest in Peace” and “Koreans for Black Lives Matter.”“I urge the US government to stop the violent suppression of (US) protesters and listen to their voices,” said Jihoon Shim, one of the rally’s organizers. “I also want to urge the South Korean government to show its support for their fight (against racism).”On Friday, protesters gathered in front of the US Embassy in Seoul to condemn what they described as US police brutality toward demonstrators in America. They also urged South Korea to push for an anti-discrimination law that had been opposed by conservatives for years to address its own problems with discrimination.In Tokyo, dozens of people gathered in a peaceful protest.“Even if we are far apart, we learn of everything instantly on social media,” Taichi Hirano, one of the organizers, shouted to the crowd gathered outside Tokyo’s Shibuya train station.“Can we really dismiss it all as irrelevant?” he asked rhetorically, stressing that Japanese are joining others raising their voices against what he called “systematic discrimination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-protests-mostly-peaceful-in-australia/story-oSGuLKW3rcOj5loMEtxWBP.html
07-06-2020||World||Mike Pompeo slams China over ‘callous exploitation’ of George Floyd’s death||US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo on Saturday (local time) hit out at China for “callous exploitation” of George Floyd’s death saying that “this laughable propaganda can’t fool anyone”.“The Chinese Communist Party’s callous exploitation of the tragic death of George Floyd to justify its authoritarian denial of basic human dignity exposes its true colours yet again. As with dictatorships throughout history, no lie is too obscene, so long as it serves the Party’s lust for power. This laughable propaganda should not fool anyone,” Pompeo said in a statement.Pompeo said that contrast between the US and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could not be more stark.“In China, when a church burns, the attack was almost certainly directed by the CCP. In America, when a church burns, the arsonists are punished by the government, and it is the government that brings fire trucks, water, aid, and comfort to the faithful,” said Pompeo.US and China have been at loggerheads with each other on a range of issues in recent times including the coronavirus pandemic and Hong Kong.The US Secretary of State said: “In China, peaceful protesters from Hong Kong to Tiananmen Square are clubbed by armed militiamen for simply speaking out. Reporters writing of these indignities are sentenced to long terms in prison. In the United States, law enforcement - both state and federal - brings rogue officers to justice, welcomes peaceful protests while forcefully shutting down looting and violence, and exercises power pursuant to the Constitution to protect property and liberty for all. Our free press covers events wall to wall, for all the world to see.”“In China, when doctors and journalists warn of the dangers of a new disease, the CCP silences and disappears them, and lies about death totals and the extent of the outbreak. In the United States, we value life and build transparent systems to treat, cure, and underwrite - more than any other nation - pandemic solutions for the globe,” he added.Pompeo said Beijing in recent days has “showcased its continuing contempt for the truth and scorn for law”.The remarks come as Chinese officials have seized on the US protests as a way of hitting back at Washington for supporting pro-democracy demonstrations in Hong Kong in 2019, reported The Hill. “The CCP’s propaganda efforts - seeking to conflate the United States’ actions in the wake of the death of George Floyd with the CCP’s continued denial of basic human rights and freedom - should be seen for the fraud that they are. During the best of times, the PRC ruthlessly imposes communism. Amid the most difficult challenges, the United States secures freedom,” said US Secretary of State.The death of Floyd on May 25 has sparked a worldwide movement against police brutality, racism and social injustice, as a video showing a white police officer, kneeling on Floyd’s neck after the latter had been arrested was widely circulated online on the next day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-slams-china-over-callous-exploitation-of-george-floyd-s-death/story-saZmLgThelczSameaD46bO.html
07-06-2020||World||Tropical storm Cristobal advances toward US gulf coast||A re-energized Tropical Storm Cristobal advanced toward the US Gulf Coast early Saturday, bringing with it the heavy rains that already caused flooding and mudslides in Mexico and Central America.After weakening to a tropical depression while moving over land in Mexico’s Gulf coast, Cristobal headed back into the southern Gulf of Mexico from the Yucatan Peninsula on Friday and powered back up into a tropical storm. Forecasters said it would arrive on US soil late Sunday but was not expected to grow into a hurricane.The National Hurricane Center in Miami said in its 7 a.m. advisory Saturday that the storm was expected to slowly strengthen until it makes landfall, expected Sunday night along the US Gulf Coast. Tropical storm-force winds could arrive as early as Saturday evening.Cristobal’s maximum sustained winds had strengthened to 50 mph (85 kph) by early Saturday and it was moving north at 12 mph (19 kph). The storm was centered about 310 miles (500 kilometers) south-southwest of the mouth of the Mississippi River.The Hurricane Center said the storm could cause heavy rains from East Texas to Florida this weekend and into early next week. A tropical storm watch was posted for the northern Gulf of Mexico coast from Intracoastal City, Louisiana, to the Alabama-Florida border.In Louisiana, Gov. John Bel Edwards has declared a state of emergency to prepare for the storm’s possible arrival.“Now is the time to make your plans, which should include the traditional emergency items along with masks and hand sanitizer as we continue to battle the coronavirus pandemic,” Edward said in a statement released Thursday.On Friday, he asked President Donald Trump to declare a pre-landfall emergency for the state due to the storm’s threat.“We are confident that there will be widespread, heavy rainfall and coastal flooding,” Edwards said in a letter to the White House. “I anticipate the need for emergency protective measures, evacuations, and sheltering for the high-risk areas. The length of possible inundation is unknown and will likely require post-flood activities.”Jefferson Parish, a suburb of New Orleans, called for voluntary evacuations Saturday of Jean Lafitte, Lower Lafitte, Crown Point and Barataria because of the threat of storm surge, high tides and heavy rain. Residents were urged to move vehicles, boats and campers to higher ground.“We want to make sure residents are safe as this storm approaches so we are taking all the necessary precautions to be fully prepared,” Jean Lafitte Mayor Tim Kerner Jr. told The Advocate.A similar order was issued Saturday for several Plaquemines Parish communities, including Happy Jack, Grand Bayou, Myrtle Grove, Lake Hertiage, Harlem and Monsecour. President Kirk Lepine said the order was issued as a precaution.“We need to ensure residents are protected as this storm draws near, so we are taking all the necessary precautions to be completely prepared,” he said.The hurricane center’s forecast path puts Alabama on Cristobal’s east side, far from where the center comes ashore. Still, the southwest part of the state is expected to get gusty winds, heavy rain, storm surge and possibly tornadoes as the storm moves closer to the coast. Those effects were expected as early as Saturday night.“Sunday will be very wet and windy as Cristobal passes west of the area, placing the central Gulf Coast on the ‘dirty’ eastern side of the storm,” the weather service said.Cristobal formed this week in the Bay of Campeche from the remnants of Tropical Storm Amanda, which had sprung up last weekend in the eastern Pacific and hit Central America. The two storms combined to soak the region with as much as 35 inches (89 centimeters) of rain in some areas over the past week. At least 30 deaths have been attributed to the two storms and the flooding and landslides they unleashed.In Bacalar, in the south of Mexico’s Quintana Roo state, 230 families were isolated by the rains and had to be airlifted out, David Leon, Mexico’s national civil defense coordinator, said Friday. Leon added there had been light damage in 75 municipalities in seven states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tropical-storm-cristobal-advances-toward-us-gulf-coast/story-Q2usyiv9D9XDu9UJ6ZKubO.html
07-06-2020||World||‘Their skin is weaponised when they enter puberty’: Black parents talk about ‘the talk’||The death of George Floyd and subsequent demonstrations nationwide have many families discussing racism -- but for many African American parents, “the talk” has long been a necessity in society where their children must learn the dangers of growing up black in the United States.“I don’t know any black parents that don’t have the talk with their child,” said Tiffany Russell, 26. “But it’s now definitely a good time.”When Russell was three years old, after a dramatic incident, her mother sat her down, explained what happened, and advised her how to behave in the future: “You have to be careful about how you act, about how you react.”“You can’t be too aggressive, too angry. She told me if a police officer stops me just don’t say anything and just listen. Even if you’re upset -- you cannot show that you’re upset.”Glen Henry, a black father of four, spoke less to his two oldest children -- ages five and seven -- about how they carried themselves, focusing more on what they were likely to encounter.A YouTuber, he filmed and posted the conversation. His wife Yvette was initially opposed to bringing up the topic so soon.By the end of the clip, she was in tears.Henry convinced her that recent events justified putting racism on the table with “children who should not have to learn this.”Brittany Everette, a 27-year-old bi-racial mother in Virginia, appealed to Twitter for help knowing if the moment had come to speak to her son.“Children see the world as this bright, shiny place full of opportunity and wonder,” she said, adding that her son who will start kindergarten in the fall sometimes dresses up as an officer. But for Russell, shielding children is “not doing any justice.”“I didn’t think it took away any of our innocence or any part of our childhood,” she said. “It made us aware of our actions.”“It’s the reality.”‘Delicate balance’Everette and her husband, who is black, ultimately agreed two discussions were necessary: first on the question of race, and later on to discuss police brutality against black people.In many ways the discussion is life-long, with added complexities at milestones including starting primary school, entering the workforce, getting a driver’s license.Joseph West, a partner at the law firm Duane Morris and a father, remembers what his own father told him before he went out for his first drive: he taught careful driving and respecting traffic rules, but also no fast moves in case of a police check, and a deferential tone even in case of an unjustified pull-over.The message? “Even though the vast majority of law enforcement officers are good people, they in fact have the power to take your life -- and you are far more likely to have that happen to you if you are a black man than if you’re not.”“It was a chilling realization to have at that time, and it is something that stays with me to this day,” West said.What’s more, the message conveyed to girls and boys often varies, said Everette.“Black boys go immediately from cute little children to threats, while black girls are sexualized and seen as mature at much younger ages,” she said “Their skin is weaponized the minute they enter puberty.”West had already discussed issues of racism with his boys, but delved into the theme once again as disturbing images of Floyd’s death circulated online.“There’s a very delicate balance that has to take place,” he said. “You want to provide enough information so that they can make informed decisions about their interactions... while not tamping down the confidence that you want them to have.”“There is a thin line between confidence which will help you be successful, and being overconfident which could get you killed,” said the lawyer, who is also his firm’s diversity officer.After publishing an essay on Law.com about speaking to black children about the trials they will face, West said he received hundreds of mostly supportive messages.Especially white men, according to West, told him that “what I had expressed never occured to them and that they were going to have that version of the talk with their children.”“And that was very gratifying.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-black-lives-matter-donald-trump-racism-their-skin-is-weaponised-when-they-enter-puberty-black-parents-talk-about-the-talk-white-supremacy-protests-us-kkk-klan-riots-us-racism-police-brutality-new-york/story-mhIlcgTgZ1hGGyQUS1ipFN.html
07-06-2020||World||$140 billion at stake for Hong Kong tycoons backing security law||After 12 months of political turmoil, a pandemic and the worst recession on record, Hong Kong’s richest people have emerged with their fortunes intact.The billionaire class of real estate developers, taipans and conglomerate founders who dominate Hong Kong’s economy are now lining up to support a controversial national security law, siding with the Chinese government despite widespread opposition from local residents and Western leaders.The nine richest people with companies listed in the city have endorsed the bill, either personally -- as was the case with Li Ka-shing and Michael Kadoorie -- or through one of their businesses or relatives. Their fortunes are worth a combined $140 billion.“Business leaders in Hong Kong have no choice if they do not relocate themselves and their businesses,” said Steve Tsang, director of the China Institute at SOAS University of London. “The passing of the decision on the national security law is a clear warning to them, and if they do not publicly support it, they know they risk being seen as opposing it.”A developer association representing firms including Lee Shau Kee’s Henderson Land Development Co. and the Kwok family’s Sun Hung Kai Properties Ltd. said it backs the law because it will guarantee stability and prosperity. The families behind Swire Pacific Ltd., Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd. and Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd. have issued similar endorsements.Critics have argued that Beijing’s plan to impose the security bill by side-stepping Hong Kong’s legislature will mark the end of the “one country, two systems” principle that has underpinned the city’s status as a global financial hub.One of the law’s staunchest opponents is media tycoon Jimmy Lai, who has called out his fellow moguls for kowtowing to Beijing. Lai was arrested along with others earlier this year as part of a crackdown on pro-democracy figures who supported demonstrations that began last June.While those protests kicked off one of the most turbulent 12 months in Hong Kong’s history, the collective fortunes of the city’s richest haven’t suffered. Since the unrest started, their net worth has actually climbed 0.7%, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. That compares with an 8.1% slide in the benchmark Hang Seng Index over the same period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/140-billion-at-stake-for-hong-kong-tycoons-backing-security-law/story-GR83AohK1ysxe83EsL7b6K.html
07-06-2020||World||White House, Pentagon tensions near breaking point||Tensions between the White House and Pentagon have stretched to near a breaking point over President Donald Trump’s threat to use military force against street protests triggered by George Floyd’s death. Friction in this relationship, historically, is not unusual. But in recent days, and for the second time in Trump’s term, it has raised a prospect of high-level resignations and the risk of lasting damage to the military’s reputation. Calm may return, both in the crisis over Floyd’s death and in Pentagon leaders’ angst over Trump’s threats to use federal troops to put down protesters. But it could leave a residue of resentment and unease about this president’s approach to the military, whose leaders welcome his push for bigger budgets but chafe at being seen as political tools. The nub of the problem is that Trump sees no constraint on his authority to use what he calls the “unlimited power” of the military even against US citizens if he believes it necessary. Military leaders generally take a far different view. They believe that active-duty troops, trained to hunt and kill an enemy, should be used to enforce the law only in the most extreme emergency, such as an attempted actual rebellion. That limit exists, they argue, to keep the public’s trust. Vincent K. Brooks, a recently retired Army four-star general, says this “sacred trust” has been breached by Trump’s threat to commit active-duty troops for law enforcement in states where he deems a governor has not not tough enough against protesters. “It is a trust that the military, especially the active-duty military — ‘the regulars’ — possessing great physical power and holding many levers that could end freedom in our society and could shut down our government, would never, never apply that power for domestic political purposes,” Brooks wrote in an essay for Harvard University’s Belfer Center, where he is a senior fellow. Even beyond the prospect of using active-duty forces, the presence of National Guard troops on the streets of the nation’s capital has drawn criticism, particularly after a Guard helicopter may have used improperly to intimidate protesters. Defense Secretary Mark Esper has made known his regret at having accompanied Trump to a presidential photo opportunity in front of a church near the White House. He has said he did not see it coming — a blind spot that cost him in the eyes of critics who saw a supposedly apolitical Pentagon chief implicitly endorsing a political agenda. Esper two days later risked Trump’s ire when he stepped before reporters at the Pentagon to declare his opposition to Trump invoking the two-centuries-old Insurrection Act. That law allows a president to use the armed forces “as he considers necessary” when “unlawful obstructions ... or rebellion against the authority of the United States” make it impractical to enforce US laws in any state by normal means. Esper said plainly that he saw no need for such an extreme measure, a clear counterpoint to Trump’s threat to use force. Almost immediately, word came from the White House that Trump was unhappy with his defense secretary, who often mentions his own military credentials as a West Point graduate and veteran of the 1991 Gulf War in Iraq. After a night of sometimes violent protesting in Washington last Sunday, Esper pulled several active-duty units, including a military police battalion, to bases just outside the nation’s capital. He never called them into action and may have figured that positioning them close to the capital would give him more time to dissuade Trump from resorting to the Insurrection Act. On Friday, officials said the last of those active-duty units were being sent back home. Trump lost his first defense secretary, retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis, over an accumulation of grievances, and it took an unusually long time to replace him. For half a year after Mattis resigned in December 2018, the Pentagon was run by acting secretaries of defense — three in succession, the longest such stretch of interim leadership in Pentagon history — before Esper took over last July. This week, Mattis added weight to the worry that Trump is militarizing his response to the street protests in Washington and across the nation. Calling himself “angry and appalled,” Mattis wrote in an essay for The Atlantic that keeping public order in times of civil unrest is the duty of civilian state and local authorities who best understand their communities and are answerable to them.. “Militarizing our response, as we witnessed in Washington, D.C., sets up a conflict — a false conflict — between the military and civilian society,” Mattis wrote. The worry felt among Pentagon leaders is reflected in the Joint Chiefs chairman, Gen. Mark Milley, reaching out privately to members of Congress in recent days to discuss concerns about use of the military on American streets. Milley has been publicly quiet since he caused a stir by joining Esper on a walk with Trump across Lafayette Square for a presidential photo opportunity Monday. The optics were awkward. Police had forcibly pushed peaceful protesters out of the way just before Trump and his entourage strolled to St. John’s Episcopal Church in the square, where Trump held up a Bible.

07-06-2020||World||Amid virus, US students look to colleges closer to home||As students make college plans for the fall, some US universities are seeing surging interest from in-state residents who are looking to stay closer to home amid the coronavirus pandemic.At the University of Texas at Arlington, commitments from state residents are up 26% over last year.Ohio State and Western Kentucky universities are both up about 20%. Deposits paid to attend Michigan State University are up 15% among state residents, while deposits from others are down 15%.Colleges and admissions counselors credit the uptick to a range of factors tied to the pandemic. Students want to be closer to home in case an outbreak again forces classes online.Some are choosing nearby schools where they’re charged lower rates as state residents. And amid uncertainty around the fall term, some are paying deposits at multiple schools to keep their options open.At the same time, scores of universities are bracing for sharp downturns in international enrollments amid visa issues and travel concerns. The result, some schools say, is that campuses will have a more local feel if they’re allowed to reopen this fall.“We are going to be a more regional and local university,” Bob McMaster, vice provost of the University of Minnesota, told the school’s board of regents at a May meeting. “The spheres of geography have certainly changed this year.” Universities across the US have ramped up recruiting efforts amid fears that the pandemic would spur students to rethink their plans.Schools have accepted more students and reached far deeper into wait lists than in the past. Some have increased financial aid. And some have focused on recruiting students in their own backyards.At the University of Minnesota, recruiters shifted attention away from bigger cities to focus on Minnesota, Wisconsin and other nearby states, McMaster said. In May, New Jersey launched a campaign urging students who had left to “come home” for college.Lisa Gelman, a private admissions counselor with Apt Tutoring in Massachusetts, said many students are rethinking earlier decisions to study far away or in cities that have become virus hot spots, including New York.For years, Lizzie Quinlivan dreamed of leaving her home in Massachusetts to study at the University of Southern California. In March, she got in. But by then, the virus was spreading across the U.S.“Anything that required a flight was suddenly off my list,” said Quinlivan, of Hingham. “I completely crossed off all California schools and even Midwest schools because of the pandemic.”Instead, she took an offer from Georgetown University in Washington. The risk of another virus outbreak still worries her, Quinlivan said, but she can get home by car or train if students are forced to leave campus like they were in the spring.For other students, the pandemic opened unexpected opportunities. Before the virus spread, Jessica Moskowitz had been placed on wait lists by some of her top schools.But as colleges scrambled to offset projected enrollment losses, she got offers from New York University, Emory University and Claremont McKenna College.If Moskowitz, of Salt Lake City, had been admitted to Emory under normal circumstances, she thinks she would have accepted. Instead she’s enrolling at the University of California, Santa Barbara, partly to stay closer to home but also because she was accepted there before the pandemic.“They wanted me from the beginning, and it never feels good to be second fiddle, to be someone’s second choice,” Moskowitz said. “Although these are amazing colleges and I was so lucky to be offered admission to them, it feels like maybe they’re just using me to fill seats in the fall.” Amid uncertainty over the course of the outbreak, more than 400 colleges extended commitment deadlines from May 1 to June 1. Scores of universities have announced plans to offer in-person instruction in the fall, but most also are preparing plans to keep classes online if needed.Among 20 public colleges that provided preliminary data to The Associated Press, roughly half reported increases in total freshman confirmations, reaching as high as 30%.The other half saw decreases of up to 15%. Some saw ebbing interest from students in other states, while others held even.Offsetting some increases in in-state students are plunging numbers for international students. At the University of Florida, new international confirmations are down 50%, the school’s data show. The University of Minnesota is down 28%, while Ohio State reported a 21% drop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-virus-us-students-look-to-colleges-closer-to-home/story-hcWukSqxBfhtuXQRriN2qK.html
07-06-2020||World||As Trump blames antifa, protest records show scant evidence||Scott Nichols, a balloon artist, was riding home on his scooter from the protests engulfing Minneapolis last weekend when he was struck by a rubber bullet fired from a cluster of police officers in riot gear.“I just pulled over and put my hands up, because I didn’t want to get killed,” said Nichols, 40. “Anybody that knows me knows I wasn’t out there to cause problems.”Nichols, who before the coronavirus pandemic made his living performing at children’s birthday parties under the stage name “Amazing Scott,” spent two days in jail before being released on criminal charges of riot and curfew violation.President Donald Trump has characterized those clashing with law enforcement after George Floyd’s death under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer as organized, radical-left thugs engaging in domestic terrorism, an assertion repeated by Attorney General William Barr. Some Democrats, including Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey, initially tried to blame out-of-state far-right infiltrators for the unrest before walking back those statements.There is scant evidence either is true.The Associated Press analyzed court records, employment histories, social media posts and other sources of information for 217 people arrested last weekend in Minneapolis and the District of Columbia, two cities at the epicenter of the protests across the United States.Rather than outside agitators, more than 85% of those arrested by police were local residents. Of those charged with such offenses as curfew violations, rioting and failure to obey law enforcement, only a handful appeared to have any affiliation with organized groups.Those charged with more serious offenses related to looting and property destruction – such as arson, burglary and theft – often had past criminal records. But they, too, were overwhelmingly local residents taking advantage of the chaos.Social media posts indicate only a few of those arrested are left-leaning activists, including a self-described anarchist. But others had indications of being on the political right, including some Trump supporters.The president has tried to portray the protesters and looters with a broad brush as “radical-left, bad people,” ominously invoking the name “antifa,” an umbrella term for leftist militants bound more by belief than organizational structure. Trump tweeted last Sunday that he planned to designate antifa as a terrorist organization.“These are acts of domestic terror,” Trump said in a Rose Garden speech Monday, moments after heavily armed troops and riot police advanced without warning on the largely peaceful protesters across the street from the White House.Barr, put in charge of organizing the police and military response, activated the FBI’s Joint Terrorism Task Force last weekend to target protest organizers.“The violence instigated and carried out by Antifa and other similar groups in connection with the rioting is domestic terrorism and will be treated accordingly,” Barr said in a statement issued Sunday.There have been violent acts, including property destruction and theft. Police officers and protesters have been seriously injured and killed. But federal law enforcement officials have offered little evidence that antifa-aligned protesters could be behind a movement that has appeared nearly simultaneously in hundreds of cities and towns in all 50 states since Floyd’s death.The AP obtained copies of daily confidential “Intelligence Notes” distributed this past week to local enforcement by the Department of Homeland Security that repeat, without citing evidence, that “organized violent opportunists — including suspected anarchist extremists — could increasingly perpetrate nationwide targeting of law enforcement and critical infrastructure.”“We lack detailed reporting indicating the level of organization and planning by some violent opportunists and assess that most of the violence to date has been loosely organized on a level seen with previous widespread outbreaks of violence at lawful protests,” the assessment for Monday says.The following day, the assessment noted “several uncorroborated reports of bricks being pre-staged at planned protest venues nationwide.”“Although we have been unable to verify the reporting through official channels, the staging of improvised weapons at planned events is a common tactic used by violent opportunists,” the Tuesday assessment says.But social media posts warning that stacks of bricks have been left at protest sites in Atlanta, Boston and Los Angeles have been debunked by local officials who have explained that the masonry was out in the open before the protests or was for use in construction projects.Nichols, the balloon artist, hardly fits the portrait of a radical.He recently gained local notice for a giant balloon rabbit and other sculptures displayed in his front yard for Easter. He laughed when asked if he had any ties to antifa or other militant groups. A white man who lives less than a half mile from where Floyd was killed on May 25, Nichols said he protested to support of his neighbors, many of whom are black.“It was the most insane thing I’ve seen in my life,” he said. “The city was going crazy.”Nichols said he and a friend helped douse a dumpster fire near a laundromat. He remembers getting a text from his mother saying that Minneapolis had set an 8 p.m. curfew, but he thought it would be enforced loosely.“Had I known that being out after curfew would be such a severe penalty, I would have never done it,” Nichols said, adding that he missed his son’s high school graduation while he was in jail.Lars Ortiz, a 35-year-old classical musician, said he was driving just blocks from his Minneapolis home on May 29 after visiting a friend recovering from COVID-19 when officers pulled him out of his car at gunpoint. He said he had been unaware of the 8 p.m. curfew enacted that night.Ortiz and another friend in the car with him were put in zip-tie restraints and forced to wait on a bus for hours before police took them to jail, where he would spend the weekend.“It was scary. It was confusing. I felt violated,” said Ortiz, a cellist who identifies as a biracial Mexican American.Ortiz was held on a riot charge and curfew violation. He said he was told when he was released from jail on Monday the more serious rioting charge was dropped.Lt. Andy Knotz of the Anoka County Sheriff’s Office, whose deputies were deployed from the suburban county north of Minneapolis into the city to help with the unrest, said it was a “chaotic scene” and that Ortiz was coming from the direction of the protests. Knotz said Ortiz was removed from his car by the Minnesota State Patrol, and an Anoka deputy took him to the police station.“In chaos like that you can’t determine who is legit and who isn’t,” Knotz said.Natalie Cook, 43, who’s white, said she had never before participated in a protest, but wanted to be there to support and protect her 24-year-old son, who’s black.“Not only did I want to go to be an ally to black people, but I wanted to go to support my son,” Cook said. “Also, I was afraid to send him out by himself.”Cook said they were marching peacefully with about 100 protesters for hours when police started using tear gas and shooting rubber bullets. As they tried to get away, they were pepper sprayed and her son was hit at close range by a rubber bullet, she said. They were both jailed and released on Monday, charged with riot and violating curfew.Cook said her son was deeply affected by Floyd’s death and she doesn’t have any regrets about going out to make their voices heard.“My son was really struggling with it,” she said. “We couldn’t just sit by and watch.”AP filed public records requests seeking arrest reports and other documents that might show what evidence law enforcement officers have against Nichols, Ortiz the Cooks and others arrested in Minneapolis. Those records have not yet been provided.In Washington, the D.C. Metropolitan Police arrested at least 81 people last weekend, including some as young as 13. Most were charged with curfew violations and felony rioting, which could result in up to 180 days in jail and $5,000 in fines.Among the highest profile arrests made by federal authorities in the last week was Matthew Lee Rupert. Prosecutors allege the 28-year-old Illinois man traveled to Minneapolis to participate in riots and then posted videos on a Facebook page showing him looting stores and handing out explosives.In one video, Rupert, a convicted felon, says: “We come to riot, boy! This is what we came for!”Though Rupert is alleged to have targeted police officers, there is no evidence cited in his indictment he is affiliated with any organized group. Among the few indicators of his political beliefs was a series of Facebook posts celebrating Trump’s 2017 inauguration. “Trump is my president but I’m not racist,” he wrote, adding that he loves Mexican food.Rupert, who made an initial court appearance Friday, remains in federal custody. A federal public defender assigned to represent him did not respond to a voicemail message seeking comment.Michael German, a former FBI agent and fellow with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, said people often travel and cross state lines to participate in protests and that not all of them have peaceful intent. He said politicians and law enforcement often cite the presence of out-of-towners to justify greater police force against protesters.“It’s an old tactic for law enforcement policing protests to suggest that the problems are being caused by outside agitators,” German said. “It opens up the opportunity for greater police violence in response.”Among those who traveled to Minneapolis to protest Floyd’s killing was Tara Houska, a 36-year-old attorney and member of the Couchiching First Nation from northern Minnesota. An activist for indigenous rights, she was arrested in Minneapolis last Saturday night and charged with not complying with a peace officer.Houska, who attended college and law school in the city, said she was with a group a couple blocks from where Floyd died when police told them they were breaking curfew. They replied they were going home, she said, and then the officers hit them with pepper spray and zip-tied their hands.“Almost everyone that was in our holding tank with us was from Minnesota,” Houska said.Sierra West, 29, of Kansas City, Missouri, said she drove to Minneapolis with a friend because she is “so angry about what is happening” with police brutality and wanted to peacefully protest.After marching for hours, West broke away from the crowds and was walking back to her car through an alley alone when police arrested her early Saturday on riot and curfew violation charges. She said she did nothing to provoke the four officers who confronted her.“They were hiding, and they literally jumped out of the shadows with guns drawn on me,” she said. “The street was completely empty.”West, who is white and describes herself as a strong supporter of the Black Lives Matter movement, was freed from jail on Monday afternoon.University of Minnesota Law School student Santana Boulton, 23, said a police officer pepper-sprayed her in the face on May 28 before she was tear-gassed two days later and then arrested on Sunday, charged with unlawful assembly and violating a curfew.About 15 minutes before the 8 p.m. curfew, Boulton said she and her boyfriend joined a large crowd of marchers on Interstate 35. People linked arms and kneeled before two lines of police officers formed near the protesters. She said she never heard any orders to disperse.“It was nothing like a riot. It was a sit-in,” she said.Boulton, a white woman who moved from Michigan to Minneapolis to attend law school, was arrested and spent 16 hours in custody. She described herself as “philosophically an anarchist,” but “not a revolutionary.”“Antifa isn’t even real,” Boulton said. “As an actual person who identifies with the political label of anarchist, the only thing anarchists do is have meetings where they argue for five hours and get nothing done.”___Kunzelman reported from Silver Spring, Maryland, Bleiberg from Dallas and Durkin Richer from West Harwich, Massachusetts.

07-06-2020||World||‘It’s complicated’: German minister says of ties with US||Germany’s relationship with the United States is “complicated”, Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a newspaper interview, regretting the planned withdrawal of US soldiers from Germany.President Donald Trump has ordered the US military to remove 9,500 troops from Germany, a senior US official said on Friday.“Should it come to the withdrawal of part of the US troops, we take note of this. We appreciate the cooperation with the US forces that has developed over decades. It is in the interests of both our countries,” Maas told Bild am Sonntag.Maas acknowledged problems in Germany’s relationship with the United States, saying: “We are close partners in the transatlantic alliance. But: It is complicated.”On Saturday, senior lawmakers from German Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling conservative bloc criticised Trump’s decision to order the US military to remove 9,500 troops from Germany.A US official, who did not want to be identified, said on Friday the troops move was the result of months of work by the top US military officer, General Mark Milley, and had nothing to do with tensions between Trump and Merkel, who thwarted Trump’s plan to host a G7 meeting this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-s-complicated-german-minister-says-of-ties-with-us/story-2pM1TSU2Vrg6x9NClnaA6N.html
07-06-2020||World||Top US military officer reaches out to Capitol Hill leaders||The nation’s top military officer, Gen. Mark Milley, spoke privately with congressional leaders and many other lawmakers as Pentagon officials came under fire for the military’s role in containing protests following the police killing of George Floyd.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., called Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, to express her concerns on Tuesday, according to two people who were not authorised to publicly discuss the private conversations and were granted anonymity. That was the day after authorities cleared protesters near the White House so President Donald Trump could hold a photo opportunity at a nearby church. Milley and Defense Secretary Mark Esper were sharply criticised for accompanying Trump and thereby giving the impression of endorsing a politicisation of the military.Milley also reached out Tuesday to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York, said another person granted anonymity to discuss the situation. A third official said Milley had spoke with perhaps 20 or more members of Congress in the days following Monday’s photo op and Trump’s implicit threat to invoke the Insurrection Act to permit him to use federal troops in a law enforcement role in the nation’s capital and in other cities.The outreach comes as Milley and Defense Secretary Mark Esper have tried to contain damage in the aftermath of Monday’s walk with Trump. Federal authorities used smoke canisters and pepper balls to clear peaceful protesters from a park so the president and his entourage could walk to the church and Trump could pose with a Bible.Late Friday, Esper and Milley declined a request from Democrats to appear before the House Armed Services Committee next week, although on Saturday the Pentagon said the door to testifying was still open.“This is unacceptable,” Rep. Adam Smith, D-Wash., the committee chairman, said in a statement Friday, joined by the panel’s 30 Democrats.“Our military leaders are sworn to be accountable to the people of this country, and Congress is constitutionally responsible for oversight,” the Democrats wrote. “They must appear and testify on these crucial matters in order to meet that responsibility.” The Pentagon’s chief spokesman, Jonathan Rath Hoffman, said Saturday evening that Esper and Milley “have not ‘refused’ to testify.” He said the Pentagon’s legislative affairs office “remains in discussion with” the committee on its request for appearances by Esper and Milley. He said the Army’s top civilian and uniformed officials, plus the head of the National Guard of Washington, DC, will brief Smith’s committee next week on the presence of the Guard in the capital.An informal briefing Friday with the secretary of the Army was canceled, according to a congressional aide who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a matter that had not been publicly disclosed.The White House has prohibited officials from the administration from testifying before the House unless they have cleared any appearances with the White House chief of staff.The protests in Washington were among those nationwide following the death of Floyd, a black man who died when a white police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes.In the call with Milley, Pelosi raised a number of issues that were spelled out in a subsequent letter to Trump seeking an accounting of “increased militarization” in response to the protests.Schumer on Tuesday warned Milley and Esper, in a speech on the Senate floor, not to allow the U.S. military to engage in “ugly stunts” like the event the night before outside the White House.Esper told reporters Wednesday he was not aware of the operation to clear the park and did not know he was heading into a photo op. He also distanced himself from Trump’s threat to step up the military’s role in quelling protests, arguing against invoking the Insurrection Act.Milley released a message this week to military leaders stating that the Constitution “is founded on the essential principle that all men and women are born free and equal and should be treated with respect and dignity” and that it ”also gives Americans the right to freedom of speech and peaceful assembly.” The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, James Inhofe, R-Okla., defended Milley’s handling of the protest.In his own Senate speech Tuesday morning, Inhofe said he wanted to “set the record straight” after conferring with Milley before and after Monday’s events.Inhofe said Milley “told me that he intends to honor his oath and uphold the delicate balance between civilians and the military, and I fully believe him.” In her letter to Trump on Thursday, Pelosi asked the president under what authority and chain of command the troops were operating in the nation’s capital, warning the approach “may increase chaos.” The House Armed Services Committee members said they expect a briefing from the Defense Department by Monday.(AP) RUP RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-military-officer-reaches-out-to-capitol-hill-leaders/story-AG0PRAbMfevoNmT440VCxM.html

All have grants from a Chan Zuckerberg Initiative program working to prevent, cure and treat neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease. The initiative is run by Zuckerberg and his wife, Priscilla Chan.They said the letter had more than 160 signatories. Shepherd said about 10% are employees of Chan Zuckerberg foundations.The letter objects specifically to Zuckerberg’s decision not to at least flag as a violation of Facebook’s community standards Trump’s post that stated “when the looting starts, the shooting starts” after unrest in Minneapolis over the videotaped killing of George Floyd, a black man, by a white police officer. The letter’s authors called the post “a clear statement of inciting violence.” Twitter had both flagged and demoted a Trump tweet using the same language.The Associated Press emailed the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative press office for comment. It did not immediately respond.Some Facebook employees have publicly objected to Zuckerberg’s refusal to take down or label misleading or incendiary posts by Trump or other politicians. But Zuckerberg — who controls a majority of voting shares in the company — has so far refused.On Friday, Zuckerberg said in a post that he would review “potential options for handling violating or partially-violating content aside from the binary leave-it-up or take-it-down decisions” “I know many of you think we should have labeled the President’s posts in some way last week,” he wrote. “Our current policy is that if content is actually inciting violence, then the right mitigation is to take that content down — not let people continue seeing it behind a flag. There is no exception to this policy for politicians or newsworthiness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/zuckerberg-funded-scientists-want-facebook-to-rein-in-trump/story-2rn0y5UqtSBH0k6oCU7aZN.html

President Vladimir Putin declared an emergency and said he expects the company to pay for the clean up, which could take years.Clean up work however has been complicated by marshy ground amid a springtime thaw and the shallow depths of the nearby Ambarnaya River, which prevents boats from reaching the scene.Russian officials said Friday that the spill was probably caused when long-frozen permafrost under the fuel tank melted and gave way, and ordered a review of infrastructure in vulnerable zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mike-pompeo-offers-us-help-in-cleaning-huge-russian-oil-spill/story-1q0ux2hD2LK74T2WqSZbCP.html

I would like to see more of us here,” he told The Associated Press.Normally, 95-year-old Shay would be meeting other survivors of the 1944 battle and celebrating with locals and dignitaries alike, all not far from his home close to the beaches that defined his life. “This year, I am one of the very few that is probably here,” he said, adding that other US veterans could not fly in because of the virus.When a full moon disappeared over land and the sun rose the other side over the English Channel, there was no customary rumble of columns of vintage jeep and trucks to be heard, roads still so deserted hare sat alongside them.Still the French would not let this day slip by unnoticed, such is their attachment to some 160,000 soldiers from the United States, Britain, Canada and other countries who spilled their blood to free foreign beaches and fight on to finally defeat Nazism almost one year later. “It’s a June 6 unlike any other,” said Philippe Laillier, the mayor of Saint-Laurent-Sur-Mer, who staged a small remembrance around the monument.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/normandy-remembers-d-day-without-crowds-amid-pandemic/story-1gz2wcX395EZtJP4Hl0k8J.html
07-06-2020||World||World witnesses another day of protests over George Floyd’s death||Tens of thousands marched in Australia, Canada, the UK, Japan, Seoul and elsewhere in solidarity with the Black Lives Matter movement as Washington, DC geared up for what’s being anticipated as the largest ever protest in the US against racism in the wake of the custodial death of George Floyd.Over 1,000 people marched in Sydney after winning a last-minute appeal against a Friday ruling declaring their rally unauthorised. In Brisbane, about 30,000 people gathered, forcing police to shut down some major streets. In the South Korean capital Seoul, protesters gathered for a second straight day to denounce Floyd’s death. Wearing masks and black shirts, dozens marched through a commercial district amid a police escort, carrying signs such as “Koreans for Black Lives Matter”. In Tokyo, dozens of people gathered in a peaceful protest. In Paris, police banned a protest planned for Saturday, citing the risk of spreading Covid-19. In Britain, tens of thousands of people ignored official advice to avoid mass gatherings and came together to protest against the killing.In Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau made an unannounced appearance at an anti-racial discrimination rally in the capital Ottawa, and then proceeded to take the knee for around nine minutes, along with protesters.US secretary of state Mike Pompeo accused China of using the unrest in the US to justify denying its own people basic human rights. “As with dictatorships throughout history, no lie is too obscene, so long as it serves the party’s lust for power,” he said, referring to the Chinese Communist Party. “This laughable propaganda should not fool anyone.”China has repeatedly criticised the US over the Floyd case.The US is now witnessing a weekend of protests described as the broadest in its history, spreading even to smaller cities and small towns, including deeply conservative ones. District of Colombia, which had another night of curfew on Friday, has seen a surging number of protesters, undeterred by the heavy presence of law enforcement. They demonstrated in front of the White House, which has been turned into a fortress with tall fences and concrete barricades and walked peacefully to the Lincoln Memorial nearby.The protests, now into their 12th day, have spread to more locations than the previous high of 650 places during the Women’s Marches of January 2017, just days after President Donald Trump took office, according to a research published in The Washington Post. The study by professors Lara Putnam, Erica Chenoweth and Jeremy Pressman noted t “the breadth of the protests is significant” and also because they took place without advance planning and in the middle of a pandemic that has kept many Americans home||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-witnesses-another-day-of-protests-over-george-floyd-s-death/story-FIPQonauLyEWfcaqnJ8k1M.html
