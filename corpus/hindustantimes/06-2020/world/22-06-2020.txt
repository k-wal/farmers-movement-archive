He has been closely involved in the listing of ‘masala bonds’ by Indian institutions on the London stock market in recent years.“Nikhil is the outstanding candidate for the position of chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority, and I am delighted that he has agreed to take up the role,” said Sunak.“We have conducted a thorough, worldwide search for this crucial appointment and, through his wide-ranging experiences across financial services, I am confident that Nikhil will bring the ambitious vision and leadership this organisation demands,” he added.The FCA is the conduct regulator for the UK’s financial markets, over 59,000 financial services firms, and the prudential supervisor for 49,000 firms, setting specific standards for 19,000 firms.It has an overarching strategic objective of ensuring the relevant markets function well. To support this it has three operational objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers.FCA chair Charles Randell said: “Nikhil has been closely involved in guiding the FCA’s development through his roles on our Practitioner Panel and Markets Practitioner Panel, and brings both private sector management skills and experience of domestic and international regulatory policymaking”.Rathi added: “I am honoured…In the years ahead, we will create together an even more diverse organisation, supporting the recovery with a special focus on vulnerable consumers, embracing new technology, playing our part in tackling climate change, enforcing high standards and ensuring the UK is a thought leader in international regulatory discussions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rishi-sunak-appoints-indian-origin-ceo-as-uk-financial-watchdog/story-LB0LadDiwioGDDuOw9T4MJ.html
22-06-2020||World||Global coronavirus cases top 9 million; outbreak surges in Brazil, India||Global cases of the novel coronavirus surpassed 9 million on Monday, as Brazil and India grappled with a surge in infections, and the United States, China and other hard-hit countries reported new outbreaks, according to a Reuters tally.The first case was reported in China in early January and it took until mid-May to reach 4.5 million cases. It has taken just five weeks to double to 9 million cases, the tally shows. The United States leads the world with the highest number of infections, at about 2.2 million or 25% of all reported cases. The tally shows the disease is spreading fastest in Latin America, which now accounts for 23% of all cases. Brazil has the second most cases behind the United States, and India is on track to overtake Russia as the third most affected country by cases.The number of global infections continues to rise at a rate of around 1%-2% a day since the beginning of June, even as many countries are taking steps to ease lockdown measures. On Friday, global cases rose by a record 176,000 in a day, according to the tally, when Brazil reported over 54,000 cases in a single day, the most of any country throughout the pandemic. Global deaths stand at over 464,000 and have doubled in seven weeks. The crisis is deepening in Brazil where the death toll is over 50,000, widespread testing is absent, and the country is still without a permanent health minister.In the United States, which has about 120,000 deaths, cases are rising again after declining for more than a month and wearing a mask is not mandatory in most states. China is also trying to contain a fresh outbreak in Beijing, where it asserts it has a capacity to test over 1 million people a day in the city alone. On its best day, the United States tested over 594,000 people nationwide but often tests fewer than half a million a day.Even in Germany, a country seen as successful in curbing the virus and limiting deaths, infection rates are rising above the level needed for long-term containment. Australia is also battling a spike in cases in Victoria where other states have seen few, if any, new cases in weeks.Still there are bright spots such as Spain reopening its borders, death rates plunging in the former hot spot of Italy, and Greece welcoming a return of foreign tourists. Just under half of all reported cases have recovered, though the number is likely higher as some countries do not report the statistic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-coronavirus-cases-top-9-million-outbreak-surges-in-brazil-india/story-2eJYO49Lby4jXZKpMCivcI.html
22-06-2020||World||Stop ‘irresponsible remarks’ on spy case: China to Canada’s Justin Trudeau||China told Prime Minister Justin Trudeau on Monday to “stop making irresponsible remarks” after he said Beijing’s decision to charge two Canadians with spying was linked to his country’s arrest of a Chinese tech executive.The spying charges are “completely different” from the case of Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, a foreign ministry spokesman said. Meng was arrested on US charges connected to possible violations of trade sanctions on Iran.Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor were detained in what was widely seen as an attempt to Canada after Meng’s December 2018 arrest in Vancouver. Charges against them were announced Friday after a Canadian judge ruled Meng’s extradition case can proceed to its next stage, moving her closer to being handed over to American authorities.Trudeau, speaking to reporters in Ottawa, said Chinese authorities “directly linked” the cases of Kovrig and Spavor with Meng. He called on Beijing to end their “arbitrary detention.” “There is no such thing as arbitrary detention,” said the ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian.“China urges the relevant Canadian leader to earnestly respect the spirit of the rule of law, respect China’s judicial sovereignty and stop making irresponsible remarks,” Zhao said.Meng, the chief financial officer of Huawei Technologies Ltd. and the daughter of its founder, is accused of lying to banks in Hong Kong about Huawei’s dealings with Iran in possible violation of US sanctions.Meng’s case is a “seriously political incident” and part of US efforts to “suppress Chinese high-tech enterprises and Huawei,” Zhao said. He said Canada “played the role of an accomplice.” “We strongly urge Canada to correct its mistakes as soon as possible, immediately release Meng Wanzhou and ensure her safe return to home,” said Zhao.Meng is living in a mansion she owns in Vancouver, where she reportedly is working on a graduate degree. Kovrig and Spavor are being held at an undisclosed location and have been denied access to lawyers or family members.China has also sentenced two other Canadians to death and suspended imports of Canadian canola.Zhao said visits by foreign diplomats to prisoners were suspended due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-irresponsible-remarks-on-spy-case-china-to-canada-s-justin-trudeau/story-g96KqZgdWrEzM1X5lCUj9I.html
22-06-2020||World||Iran’s currency reaches lowest value ever against dollar||Iran’s currency on Monday dropped to its lowest value ever against the dollar and officials warned Iranian exporters to bring their foreign earnings home from abroad.Money exchange shops briefly traded the Iranian rial 200,000 for a dollar and later in the day, the currency was valued at 198,000 rials against the dollar. The lows were a new record after the rial on Saturday traded at 190,000 for the dollar.The plunge of the rial comes amid severe US sanctions imposed on Tehran. Iran’s Senior Vice President Eshaq Jahangiri on Monday urged Iranian exporters to bring home their earnings from abroad. Last week, Jahangiri said Iran’s oil revenues have plummeted to $8 billion from $100 billion in 2011.The country’s commerce ministry warned that it would revoke export licenses for those who fail to comply and bring the hard currency home while Iran’s central bank said on Sunday that it would publish the names of the violators.Iranian companies reportedly export non-oil products in the value of more than 40 billion dollars a year, and officials say about half of that money stays abroad.The rial has tumbled from a rate of 32,000 rials to $1 at the time of Tehran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. The currency unexpectedly rallied for some time after President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw the US from the nuclear deal and reimpose crippling trade sanctions on Iran more than two years ago.The sanctions have caused Iran’s oil exports, the country’s main source of income, to fall sharply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-s-currency-reaches-lowest-value-ever-against-dollar/story-UP8RMFLbMyHMGrQ1LpNp7J.html

The IS in Afghanistan is headquartered in eastern Nangarhar province.According to a statement from the attorney general’s office, the car was on the way to office when it was targeted. The gunmen fled the scene, the police said. Faramarz said an investigation was underway.In early June, IS claimed responsibility of a bomb explosion in a mosque in Kabul that killed two people, including the prayer leader. Eight worshipers were wounded.A week later, another prayer leader and three worshipers were killed in a bomb explosion inside another mosque in Kabul. Eight people were wounded in that attack.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-hit-car-in-kabul-killing-5-including-2-prosecutors/story-0R9nRFW9zzZZVEHbtBq4oK.html

Germany’s DAX slid 0.7% to 12,250, with payments company Wirecard diving almost 40% after it said that some $2 billion in missing funds in an accounting scandal probably don’t exist.US markets appeared set to edge up, with futures for the S&P 500 and the Dow up 0.6% and 0.5%.Tokyo’s Nikkei 225 index slipped 0.2% to 22,437.27, while the Hang Seng in Hong Kong sank 0.5% to 24,515.23. The Kospi in South Korea slipped 0.7% to 2,126.73.The Shanghai Composite index edged 0.1% lower to 2,965.27, while India’s Sensex jumped 0.9%. Sydney’s S&P/ASX 200 was almost unchanged at 5,944.50, supported by a report that consumer spending has rebounded more quickly from the pandemic shock than expected, analysts said.Investors appear cautious with prices already relatively high and “out of whack” with earnings expectations, Mizuho Bank said in a commentary. “And so, investors may be increasingly nervous about being caught on the wrong side of ‘irrational exuberance,’ “ it said.On top of that, the “sheer speed and amplitude of the equity market rebound ... from the depths of the March sell-off may also counsel some patience rather than haste; prudently pausing to take profits for the quarter,” it said.The World Health Organization on Sunday reported the largest single-day increase in coronavirus cases by its count, at more than 183,000 new cases in the previous 24 hours. The UN health agency said on Sunday that Brazil led the way with 54,771 cases and the US next at 36,617. India confirmed 15,400 new cases.The United States also reported more than 30,000 new coronavirus cases on Friday and Saturday, with the daily totals their highest since May 1. A large share of the cases are in the South, West and Midwest, where hospitals in some areas are becoming overwhelmed.Case numbers in South Korea and China have appeared to be moderating after recent outbreaks centered in their capitals.Great uncertainty remains over whether countries that have been relaxing pandemic-fighting restrictions on travel and business might end up re-imposing broader controls that would slow a recovery from the worst global downturn since the Great Depression in the 1930s.“The extent to which the Covid-19 pandemic slows economic recovery could increasingly come into focus. These shifting dynamics are always challenging to equate,” Stephen Innes of AxiCorp said in a commentary.Even if widespread stay-at-home orders don’t happen, the fear is that scared shoppers may still shy away from stores and businesses may pull back on their own spending.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note was steady Monday at 0.70% after climbing as high as 0.74% on Friday. It tends to move with investors’ expectations for the economy and inflation.A barrel of US crude oil for delivery in July fell 25 cents to $39.50 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It rose 2.3% to settle at $39.75 on Friday. Brent crude, the international standard, shed 18 cents to $42.01 per barrel.In currency trading, the dollar was at 106.93 Japanese yen, up from 106.87 on Friday.

22-06-2020||World||After face-off with India, China embroiled in maritime dispute with Japan||Japan has begun the legal process of complete integration of an island chain over which it has a dispute with China. The development came just a week after the violent clash between Indian and Chinese troops over the Line of Actual Control. Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in that clash in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley. The Ishigaki city council in Japan’s Okinawa prefecture passed a bill to change the name of an administrative area covering the disputed uninhabited island chain to Tonoshiro Senkaku from Tonoshiro, starting October 1, according to media reports. The island group lies 1,931 km southwest of Tokyo. The Senkakus island chain, which China calls Diaoyus, has been administered by Japan since 1972, but its legal status has remained disputed until now.Calling the islands its “inherent territories”, China on Monday warned Tokyo against any change in the status quo.Beijing urged Japan to “abide by the spirit of the four-principle consensus, avoid creating new incidents on the Diaoyu Islands issue, and take practical actions to maintain the stability of the East China Sea situation”.However, the Japanese city council said that the bill was necessary to “improve the efficiency of administrative procedures”.Since April, Chinese ships had been spotted by the Japanese coast guard, in the waters close to the Senakakus. The number of Chinese ships have only increased in the last few weeks with four of them sailing in the area even on the day when the bill was passed by the city council, reports news agency IANS. Japan’s cabinet secretary last week reiterated that the Senkakus are under Tokyo’s control and “unquestionably” their territory historically and under international law. “It is extremely serious that these activities continue. “We will respond to the Chinese side firmly and calmly,” he had warned, the IANS report added.The Senkakus island chain dispute with Japan is not the only territorial and maritime dispute that China has long had with many of its neighbours. It has island and maritime border disputes with Taiwan, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam in the South China Sea and its extension. The disputes include islands, reefs, banks and other features in the South China Sea including Spratly Islands (with Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan), Paracel Islands (Vietnam), Scarborough Shoal (Philippines), and Gulf of Tonkin (Vietnam).Last week, China’s air force approached Taiwan on Friday for the fourth time in four days, Taiwan’s military said, as China steps up manoeuvres near the island that Beijing claims as its own territory. The Chinese air force was given a verbal warning to leave, and Taiwanese jets “responded”, Taiwan’s air force said, without giving further details.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-face-off-with-india-china-embroiled-in-maritime-dispute-with-japan/story-aPSWNmYndKkcpcuf4tYDGL.html
22-06-2020||World||Covid-19: New no-swab, saliva test pilot project begins in UK||Britain’s health officials on Monday began a month-long, no-swab test pilot project to detect coronavirus in homes in Southampton that involves participants putting their saliva into a sample pot, with results delivered in 48 hours.Test kits are being first delivered to doctors, other essential key workers, employees of the University of Southampton and members of their households. Samples will be collected safely from homes by university staff or returned to an agreed location on a weekly basis.Health secretary Matt Hancock said, “Saliva testing could potentially make it even easier for people to take coronavirus tests at home, without having to use swabs. This trial will also help us learn if routine, at-home testing could pick up cases of the virus earlier”.The officials said the saliva test will be significant to increasing testing capacity and accessibility as it does not require the use of a swab, which some people find uncomfortable. The test has already been shown to be highly promising; the pilot is undertaking further validation against polymerase chain reaction nasal swabs, they added.Weekly testing as part of the pilot is expected to help identify coronavirus cases early, including for those with no or minor symptoms, meaning those who test positive can isolate within their households.Debbie Chase of Southampton city council said: “We will initially invite Southampton’s 800-strong GP (general practitioner) practice workforce and their households to take part, followed by some other essential key workers and some University of Southampton staff and students as we evaluate the logistics needed for regular testing of large population groups”.Keith Godfrey of the University of Southampton added: “The health, social and economic impacts of lockdown cannot be underestimated. Through this initiative we believe we can contribute to safely restoring economic activity within the city and region during national relaxation measures, whilst enabling people to regain their lives, work and education”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-new-no-swab-saliva-test-pilot-project-begins-in-uk/story-kk0PPusHWSZy9YRR1YCBiM.html
22-06-2020||World||Europe braces for second covid-19 wave as authorities push for medical workers hiring||Europeans are enjoying the gradual easing of coronavirus lockdown measures, but in hospitals they are already preparing for the next wave of infections.Some intensive care specialists are trying to hire more permanent staff. Others want to create a reservist “army” of medical professionals ready to be deployed wherever needed to work in wards with seriously ill patients. European countries have been giving medics crash courses in how to deal with Covid-19 patients, and are now looking at ways to retrain staff to avoid shortages of key workers if there is a second wave of the novel coronavirus.“We need a healthcare army,” said Maurizio Cecconi, president-elect of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), which brings together medics from around the world who work in wards with extremely ill patients.Cecconi, who heads the intensive care department at the Humanitas hospital in Milan, says medical staff need to be more flexible in the work they do, and more mobile.“If there is another big wave, we should be prepared to deploy doctors and nurses from nearby regions within Italy. This did not happen a lot in the first wave,” he told Reuters.Many countries were caught unprepared by the Covid-19 pandemic in March and April, and hastily retrained medics to work with patients with severe cases of the disease, to ramp up numbers and replace those who fell sick.Some sent medical students and retired doctors to help out in intensive care wards as hospital staff were overwhelmed. Those worst-hit by the pandemic had to provide more beds and essential equipment for acute care units, and some built new hospitals.But problems and shortages persist. Italy, for example, may need to boost by 50% the number of anaesthetists, resuscitation experts and other medics it has working in intensive care, according to the Italian society of intensive care SIAARTI. Crash coursesAcross Europe, hospitals have been re-training surgeons, cardiologists, internal medicine physicians and nurses from other departments, and have moved them to intensive care units when needed. Many have attended crash courses on how to handle Covid-19 patients, said Jozef Kesecioglu, president of ESICM and head of intensive care at the University Medical Center of Utrecht, in the Netherlands.“We gave them jobs with less responsibility, such as washing patients, turning patients around, checking the lungs or looking at scans,” he told Reuters.Intensive care specialists had continued to do the most delicate work, such as handling tubes in patients’ throats or adjusting mechanical ventilation, Kesecioglu said.He plans to call back the same people to offer them more training. Under normal circumstances, intensive care workers undergo years of training but he said: “We should not wait until the new wave comes, we should give them regular training.” The Netherlands is trying to recruit more skilled workers and hopes to narrow structural gaps in the intensive care workforce, said Rotterdam’s Erasmus Medical Centre, one of the largest university hospitals in Europe. SIAARTI says medical students who specialise in intensive care medicine should be fully integrated into wards for the last two years of their five-year training, and has recommended financial incentives be offered to attract more students. The European Commission, the European Union’s executive, funded cross-border transfers of medical staff to the most affected countries at the height of the coronavirus crisis.In April, teams of “flying doctors” were sent from Norway and Romania to Italy.But the experiment has failed to gather much support, and Cecconi said moving doctors from one country to another “should be an option but not the first option,” as language barriers may make them less effective. Some patients were also moved around to receive treatment. France transferred some to less-affected regions of the country and sent others to Germany, which also took in Covid-19 patients from Italy.But Cecconi warned of transportation risks and logistical complications. “Often our patients are very sick,” he said. “I’d rather have skilled people who know how to work in my environment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fearing-second-covid-19-wave-europe-aims-to-train-army-of-medics/story-4zljhPlgJT0znsUBunXhuL.html
22-06-2020||World||Vladimir Putin signals for first time he may seek to extend rule in 2024||Vladimir Putin said he’ll consider running for a fifth presidential term in 2024, arguing that the hunt for any successor risks paralyzing Russia’s government as the next election nears.“I don’t rule out such a possibility,” if the necessary amendment to the constitution is approved, Putin said in a Rossiya 1 television documentary broadcast late Sunday. “I haven’t made up my mind yet.”On July 1, Russians will vote on the most sweeping changes to the nation’s constitution since it was adopted almost 30 years ago. One of the amendments would allow Putin, 67, to reset his term limit to zero even though he’s already served four, and to helm the country for two more six-year terms when his current one expires in 2024. In power since 2000, Putin is already the longest-serving Kremlin leader since Josef Stalin.Without that amendment, “I can tell you from my own experience that in about two years, instead of the regular rhythmic work on many levels of government, you’d have eyes shifting around hunting for possible successors,” Putin said. “It’s necessary to work, not look for successors.”A top ally of the Russian president, Andrei Klishas, a senior lawmaker who helped to steer the constitutional overhaul, said that Russians should stop thinking about who will rule after Putin leaves office.“They should get used to the idea that everything will remain the same, that the president can be re-elected if people support these changes to the Constitution,” Klishas said in an interview with RBC newspaper published Monday. “This amendment allows us to put aside the issue of successors, transfer of power and so on.”Putin’s spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, on Monday denied the president’s comment meant the political system he built was incapable of functioning in the event of a change of leadership. But he said speculation over potential successors “is a characteristic of our national bureaucracy.”For the moment, Putin’s main goal is to avoid becoming a “lame duck” in the final years of his current mandate, said Leonid Davydov, a political analyst at the Foundation for Civil Society Development in Moscow. But there is “little doubt” that the Russian president will choose to run again for election, he said.In the same state-TV interview Sunday, Putin also harshly criticized neighbouring states for absorbing “traditional Russian historic territories” on independence in 1991 that they had acquired during the existence of the Soviet Union.These states should have “left with what they arrived, rather than taking with them presents from the Russian people,” he said.Russia, which annexed Crimea in 2014 from Ukraine, restoring control over the peninsula that had been Russian until 1954, doesn’t have any territorial claims on its neighbors, Peskov told reporters Monday on a conference call, in response to a question about this comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vladimir-putin-signals-for-first-time-he-may-seek-to-extend-rule-in-2024/story-KEPUA7ZyDtY2fZdHZK7q1M.html

Test results will be received within 48 hours, the government said.The pilot will be jointly led by Southampton City Council, the University of Southampton, and the state-run health service, alongside a wider network of public services in Hampshire.The government said it was also exploring the potential of other no-swab saliva based coronavirus tests with companies including Chronomics, Avacta, MAP Science and Oxford Nanoimaging (ONI). It said it was also working with suppliers including DNA Genotek, International Scientific Supplies Ltd, Isohelix and other leading manufacturers, to develop bespoke saliva collection kits and scale up manufacturing for products that can be used with existing PCR tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-starts-trial-of-no-swab-saliva-test-for-covid-19/story-GvdPcOAl6mdljbRlagkIPN.html

He said the basic reproduction number of virus carriers, which measures the number of infections caused by an individual, has reached nearly 1.8 for the period between April 30 and June 11. Any number above 1 indicates a growing epidemic.In a separate briefing, Jeong Eun-kyeong, director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, acknowledged that the country was now going through a second wave of the virus, following a surge in late February and March centered around the southeastern city of Daegu.The country has been reporting around 40 to 50 new cases per day since late May, mostly from the Seoul metropolitan area, where about half of South Korea’s 51 million people live.South Korea was reported around 500 new case per day in early March but managed to control the outbreak with an active testing and contact tracing campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fears-south-korea-losing-control-over-second-coronavirus-wave/story-AbxozK6y0WjwsdLsv7L5vI.html

He was beautiful, intelligent, honest and fun. He was the best son, brother, uncle and partner you could wish for. We are thankful for the memories he gave us all. We will never forget him and he will live in our hearts forever.”US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said: “I offer my deepest condolences to the families of those killed in the attack on June 20. To our great sorrow, this includes an American citizen. Our thoughts are with all those affected. We condemn the attack absolutely and have offered our assistance to British law enforcement”.Khairi Saadallah, 25, of Libyan origin, who was arrested under terrorism laws, was on the radar of British intelligence services in mid-2019, but the case was dropped since no immediate threat was identified.Saadallah was reportedly granted asylum in the UK and was under investigation as a person who may travel abroad for extremist reasons, but no immediate threat was identified. Some reports said he may have mental health issues.The UK’s terrorism threat level was lowered in November 2019 from ‘severe’ to ‘substantial’, which means an attack is likely. Security minister James Brokenshire said it was unlikely to be changed after the Reading attack.He said: “What I would say is that the police and security services obviously deal with thousands of leads, that they have difficult challenges that they have in terms of prioritisation of resource, but I can assure that if there are lessons to be learned, there are policies that needs to be changed, if we need to do things differently, absolutely that is what we will do”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/school-teacher-us-citizen-among-3-stabbed-to-death-in-uk-terror-attack/story-ubZ7MHpVu8JXZuvB92LAfO.html

The government is drawing up new laws to prohibit the wildlife trade and protect pets, and campaigners are hoping that this year will be the last time the festival is held.“I do hope Yulin will change not only for the sake of the animals but also for the health and safety of its people,” said Peter Li, China policy specialist with the Humane Society International, an animal rights group.“Allowing mass gatherings to trade in and consume dog meat in crowded markets and restaurants in the name of a festival poses a significant public health risk,” he said.The coronavirus, which is believed to have originated in horseshoe bats before crossing into humans in a market in the city of Wuhan, has forced China to reassess its relationship with animals, and it has vowed to ban the wildlife trade. In April, Shenzhen became the first city in China to ban the consumption of dogs, with others expected to follow. The agriculture ministry also decided to classify dogs as pets rather than livestock, though it remains unclear how the reclassification will affect Yulin’s trade. Zhang Qianqian, an animal rights activist who was in Yulin on Saturday, said it was only a matter of time before the dog-meat festival was banned. “From what we understand from our conversations with meat sellers, leaders have said the consumption of dog meat won’t be allowed in future,” she said. “But banning dog-meat consumption is going to be hard and will take some time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-annual-dog-meat-fair-opens-activists-hope-for-last-time/story-liCnNsKjBYnyTgWrDHvaKI.html
22-06-2020||World||Jailed UK-Iranian pleads with PM Johnson to help inmates||The sound is a little fuzzy but Anoosheh Ashoori’s voice does not falter as he delivers his message to British Prime Minister Boris Johnson from inside Iran’s Evin jail.“We are in desperate need of your help,” the retired engineer, who holds British and Iranian passports, says in a recording made on the phone to his wife in London.During the three years since his arrest in Tehran, he has endured interrogations and stints in solitary that made him try to end his life, but the 66-year-old’s biggest fear now is coronavirus.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“I am appealing to you to take action and get me and my fellow British citizens out of Evin prison, where the threat of Covid-19 is as strong as ever,” he urged Johnson, in the recording shared with AFP.“My fear is that we have been forgotten by the British government.”Ashoori was visiting his mother in Tehran in August 2017 when he was arrested, accused of spying for Israel and later jailed for 10 years, his family says.Dual nationals from various countries have been detained in Iran, in what campaigners and the British government say is a policy of hostage-taking aimed at pressuring the West.In an interview in the garden of Ashoori’s southeast London home, his wife, Sherry Izadi, dismisses the charges against him as “preposterous” and says his trial only lasted an hour.The father-of-two had never been involved in politics, she said, telling AFP: “We’re very ordinary -- we’re extremely unimportant.”And yet, “he went out one day to do some shopping and he never came back”.Nothing to lose’She said initially, long interrogations and time spent in solitary confinement threatened to break her husband, who staged a 17-day hunger strike and tried to kill himself.Since his conviction he has been better, keeping fit and joining impromptu lessons with fellow inmates, but the family fears for the future.“It would be unimaginable for someone innocent to stay somewhere for 10 years for something he’s never done,” she says.Some foreign prisoners were given temporary release at the start of the coronavirus outbreak, including British-Iranian Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, whose husband has campaigned relentlessly for her freedom.But Ashoori remains in jail and the family are increasingly impatient with the lack of progress made by the British government.Izadi met Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab in October but says “nothing has come of it”.The Foreign Office advised them not to talk to the media while it tried the diplomatic route, but Ashoori has asked them to release his statements, which form part of a diary he is recording in daily calls with his wife.“He says he’s got nothing to lose,” his daughter Elika, 33, told AFP.Diplomatic pawns The Foreign Office has recorded around a dozen incidents of people with British passports being arrested in Iran since 2015, and in May last year it advised dual British-Iranian nationals not to visit.Former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt in December 2018 accused Tehran of using foreign passport holders as “pawns of diplomatic leverage” -- a claim Iran strongly denies.Supporters of Ashoori and Zaghari-Ratcliffe believe their cases are linked to a long-running legal battle over £400 million ($500 million) Iran paid to Britain in the 1970s for tanks that were never delivered.But campaigners have also cried foul over the detention of dual nationals from other countries, including French-Iranian academic Fariba Adelkhah.In another message sent from prison, Ashoori says one of his fellow inmates witnessed Adelkhah being brought into jail.She was “kicked and dragged on the floor by her hair, and was showered with curses and other physical and verbal abuse” by secret police guards, he said.Due judicial process A Foreign Office spokesman said the fate of the dual nationals held in Iran was “a priority” and raised with Tehran at the highest levels of government.“We strongly urge Iran to reunite British-Iranian dual national Mr Ashoori with his family,” a spokesman said.But the Iranian embassy in London rejected any claims of politically motivated charges.Ashoori had been convicted of “national security-related crimes by the Iranian judiciary in a due judicial process in which Mr. Ashoori had the right and opportunity to defend himself,” it said in a statement to AFP.“Iranian authorities ensures proper access to medical services for prisoners inside or outside prisons based on regular checks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-uk-iranian-pleads-with-pm-johnson-to-help-inmates/story-nBFdZ5oHd48ecUqQPKVL6L.html
22-06-2020||World||Coronavirus outbreak could spin ‘out of control’ in South Sudan||It began with a dry cough, weakness and back pain. For Reagan Taban Augustino, part of South Sudan’s small corps of health workers trained in treating Covid-19 patients, there was little doubt what he had.Days later, hardly able to breathe, the 33-year-old doctor discovered just how poorly equipped his country is for the coronavirus pandemic: None of the public facilities he tried in the capital, Juba, had oxygen supplies available until he reached South Sudan’s only permanent infectious disease unit, which has fewer than 100 beds for a country of 12 million people.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIt took more than an hour to admit him. “I was almost dying at the gate,” he told The Associated Press from the unit last week.The pandemic is now accelerating in Africa, the World Health Organization says. While the continent had more time than Europe and the United States to prepare before its first case was confirmed on Feb. 14, experts feared many of its health systems would eventually become overwhelmed.South Sudan, a nation with more military generals than doctors, never had a fighting chance. Five years of civil war and corruption stripped away much of its health system, and today nongovernmental organizations provide the majority of care. Nearly half of the population was hungry before the pandemic. Deadly insecurity continues, and a locust outbreak arrived just weeks before the virus.When world leaders talk about the pandemic not being over until it’s over everywhere, they are talking about places like South Sudan.The United Nations says the country’s outbreak is growing rapidly, with nearly 1,900 cases, including more than 50 health workers infected, more than 30 deaths and no way to know the true number of infections. At one point several members of the Covid-19 task force tested positive, including Vice President Riek Machar.“It can be out of control at any time,” said David Gai Zakayo, a doctor with the aid group Action Against Hunger.“The groups we are treating are malnourished,” Zakayo said. “My big worry is if the virus begins spreading to those groups we are treating, it will be a disaster.”At South Sudan’s only laboratory that tests for the virus, supervisor Simon Deng Nyichar said the team of 16 works up to 16-hour days slogging through a backlog of more than 5,000 tests. Around 9,000 samples have been tested since early April, when the country became one of the last in Africa to confirm a coronavirus case.With materials in short supply, testing is largely limited to people with symptoms of Covid-19. It can take weeks to receive results, “creating mistrust in communities and resentment toward contact tracers,” the Health Ministry said last week.Three lab workers have been infected and recovered, Nyichar told the AP. “This is the nature of our work. We are not scared of the disease.”With the long hours, they work in pairs to stay sharp. “It’s a must for everybody to have a buddy as a helper to monitor all the steps on the dos and don’ts, otherwise we would have infected all of us,” he said.While they’re aware of the dangers, South Sudan’s population at large still takes convincing.The government’s loosening of lockdown measures last month was “perceived as an indication that the disease is not in South Sudan,” the Health Ministry said. Bars, restaurants and shops are open after people said they feared hunger more than the disease.Some people have died waiting for rapid-response teams to arrive, the ministry said. And this month it stopped issuing “Covid-19 negativity certificates,” citing the peddling of fake ones — especially around Juba International Airport.Meanwhile the virus has spread into more rural areas, including one of the United Nations-run camps upcountry where more than 150,000 civilians still shelter after South Sudan’s civil war ended in 2018.There’s been an increase in deaths related to respiratory tract infections at that camp in Bentiu, WHO official Wamala Joseph told reporters last week, though it’s not clear whether they were from the virus. Testing is difficult as all samples must be flown to the capital. “This is a very vulnerable population,” he said.Three of the six camps have no virus screening at the gate, according to a U.N. migration agency document dated this month. One camp has no facility to isolate the sick, and another will only have one when a generator is installed. Listed under preventative measures for the two camps in Juba, home to 30,000 people: “Face masks to be distributed in coming weeks.”Meanwhile “our hospitals are full,” Wolde-Gabriel Saugeron, who leads the International Committee of the Red Cross’ team in Bor, wrote last week. “Covid-19 means that we need to create more space between our hospital beds, which has reduced the number of people we can accommodate in our wards by 30%.”The pandemic is also worsening what was already a major problem in South Sudan: hunger.Most border crossings are closed, and food prices in the markets have shot up. Now the rainy season has started, making transport and storage more difficult.More than 1.5 million people in South Sudan are newly vulnerable, including the urban poor who had not been receiving aid before, the U.N. humanitarian agency said last week.“I cannot be saying famine, but I can say Covid-19 will worsen the situation,” said Kawa Tong, health and nutrition manager for the aid group CARE.She knows the country already faced a long and winding path to emerge from multiple crises, starting with progress on the peace agreement that ended the civil war. Security would need to improve, people would find the confidence to return to their homes and begin cultivating their crops, and hunger would fall.But now, of course, there’s the pandemic, and Tong has no idea when or how it will end.“People are overwhelmed,” she said. “People are scared.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-outbreak-could-spin-out-of-control-in-south-sudan/story-pihF2VKd08yzq8s8fi9GJO.html
22-06-2020||World||Fearing second Covid-19 wave, Europe aims to train ‘army’ of medics||Europeans are enjoying the gradual easing of coronavirus lockdown measures, but in hospitals they are already preparing for the next wave of infections.Some intensive care specialists are trying to hire more permanent staff. Others want to create a reservist “army” of medical professionals ready to be deployed wherever needed to work in wards with seriously ill patients. European countries have been giving medics crash courses in how to deal with Covid-19 patients, and are now looking at ways to retrain staff to avoid shortages of key workers if there is a second wave of the novel coronavirus.“We need a healthcare army,” said Maurizio Cecconi, president-elect of the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), which brings together medics from around the world who work in wards with extremely ill patients.Cecconi, who heads the intensive care department at the Humanitas hospital in Milan, says medical staff need to be more flexible in the work they do, and more mobile.“If there is another big wave, we should be prepared to deploy doctors and nurses from nearby regions within Italy. This did not happen a lot in the first wave,” he told Reuters.Many countries were caught unprepared by the Covid-19 pandemic in March and April, and hastily retrained medics to work with patients with severe cases of the disease, to ramp up numbers and replace those who fell sick.Some sent medical students and retired doctors to help out in intensive care wards as hospital staff were overwhelmed. Those worst-hit by the pandemic had to provide more beds and essential equipment for acute care units, and some built new hospitals.But problems and shortages persist. Italy, for example, may need to boost by 50% the number of anaesthetists, resuscitation experts and other medics it has working in intensive care, according to the Italian society of intensive care SIAARTI. CRASH COURSESAcross Europe, hospitals have been re-training surgeons, cardiologists, internal medicine physicians and nurses from other departments, and have moved them to intensive care units when needed. Many have attended crash courses on how to handle Covid-19 patients, said Jozef Kesecioglu, president of ESICM and head of intensive care at the University Medical Center of Utrecht, in the Netherlands.“We gave them jobs with less responsibility, such as washing patients, turning patients around, checking the lungs or looking at scans,” he told Reuters.Intensive care specialists had continued to do the most delicate work, such as handling tubes in patients’ throats or adjusting mechanical ventilation, Kesecioglu said.He plans to call back the same people to offer them more training. Under normal circumstances, intensive care workers undergo years of training but he said: “We should not wait until the new wave comes, we should give them regular training.” The Netherlands is trying to recruit more skilled workers and hopes to narrow structural gaps in the intensive care workforce, said Rotterdam’s Erasmus Medical Centre, one of the largest university hospitals in Europe. SIAARTI says medical students who specialise in intensive care medicine should be fully integrated into wards for the last two years of their five-year training, and has recommended financial incentives be offered to attract more students. The European Commission, the European Union’s executive, funded cross-border transfers of medical staff to the most affected countries at the height of the coronavirus crisis.In April, teams of “flying doctors” were sent from Norway and Romania to Italy.But the experiment has failed to gather much support, and Cecconi said moving doctors from one country to another “should be an option but not the first option,” as language barriers may make them less effective. Some patients were also moved around to receive treatment. France transferred some to less-affected regions of the country and sent others to Germany, which also took in Covid-19 patients from Italy.But Cecconi warned of transportation risks and logistical complications. “Often our patients are very sick,” he said. “I’d rather have skilled people who know how to work in my environment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fearing-second-covid-19-wave-europe-aims-to-train-army-of-medics/story-44FlZVLpNF4vzY2nYdm7HK.html
22-06-2020||World||Black candidates tap protest energy to challenge Democrats||Amy McGrath and Eliot Engel live hundreds of miles apart in states with dramatically different politics.Yet they are both the preferred candidates of the Democratic Party’s Washington establishment as voters in Kentucky and New York decide their congressional primary elections on Tuesday. And both may be in trouble.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageOn the eve of their elections, Engel, a 16-term House incumbent who represents parts of the Bronx and New York City’s wealthy suburbs, and McGrath, a former military officer and fundraising juggernaut running in her first Kentucky Senate campaign, are facing strong challenges from lower-profile Black candidates. The challengers have tapped into the wounded progressive movement’s desire for transformational change suddenly animated by sweeping civil rights protests across America.Engel’s challenger, 45-year-old former public school principal Jamaal Bowman, and McGrath’s opponent, 35-year-old state Rep. Charles Booker, speak openly about their personal experience with police brutality and racism as they promote progressive plans to transform the nation’s health care system and economy. And both accuse their white opponents of being absent from the front lines of the civil rights debate.Bowman and Booker have also won the endorsement of Bernie Sanders, among a growing list of progressive leaders trying to influence the races from afar. The Vermont senator failed to win the Democratic Party’s presidential nomination, but he continues to shape congressional primaries — even if it puts him at odds with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who is backing Engel, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, who helped recruit McGrath.“There is no question the momentum is with us,” Sanders said in an interview.But the story of Bowman and Booker’s rise extends well beyond the yearslong tug-of-war between the progressive and pragmatic wings of the Democratic Party. They did not gain traction until after George Floyd’s death last month triggered nationwide outrage about racial inequality.Hours before polls open, however, it’s far from certain their bids will be successful.In New York, the progressive pushback against Engel’s reelection was somewhat surprising given his status as one of the Democratic Party’s most liberal members. He has also drawn overwhelming support from African Americans in Congress and establishment leaders such as Hillary Clinton.In an interview, he noted that he was a founding member of the House Medicare for All Caucus, an original co-sponsor of the Green New Deal, and the endorsed candidate of the congressional Black and Hispanic caucuses.“I’ve always believed that Black lives matter. I didn’t have to see a tragedy to know that,” said Engel, 73. “All I can do for people is say, ‘Here’s my record.’ I can’t control outside events.”Engel admits regret over an unforced error of sorts earlier in the month when he was caught on a hot microphone telling a New York colleague at a news conference about the civil unrest: “If I didn’t have a primary, I wouldn’t be here.”He says the comments were taken out of context, but he also understands why some people would be upset.“Do I wish the whole event hadn’t happened? Sure. But it doesn’t change my record,” Engel said.Bowman seized on the comment and the perception that Engel has lost touch with the entirety of his diverse district, which features Westchester County’s multimillion-dollar homes and the Bronx’s housing projects. In both communities, Bowman said, there is a growing sense of unity around racial justice.“We’re seeing protests and uprisings in communities that are white and wealthy and stereotypically don’t care about racial justice,” he said in an interview. “That’s inspiring and it’s helpful to us because everyone knows we were talking about police brutality. I was sharing my personal story, and we were going after institutional racism from the very beginning of our campaign.”The winner of the New York House primary on Tuesday is expected to win the general election easily given the district’s strong Democratic tilt. Kentucky’s Senate primary will determine which Democrat runs against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who is unpopular but a proven political force in a deep-red state.Washington Democrats helped recruit McGrath, thinking her military history and centrist approach would play well, even in a state that backed Trump by 30 points four years ago. The former Marine fighter pilot reported an eye-popping $19 million in the bank at the beginning of the month. Booker reported just $285,000 at that time, although his campaign told the AP he raised at least $2.4 million more this month.Booker’s recent fundraising surge coincides with the protests, although it’s unclear whether the focus on racial inequality will resonate to the same degree in a state where just 8% of residents are Black and 3 out of 4 don’t have a bachelor’s degree, according to the Census Bureau.“It is real,” Booker said of racism in his state. “I’ve had ancestors lynched in Kentucky.”Just this month, he says he was tear-gassed by police in the Louisville district he represents while attending a peaceful rally.“I’m there to make sure people are safe, make sure nothing goes wrong and that people’s voices are heard. And we look up and three canisters are thrown within 10 feet of me,” Booker told the AP. “Everyone starts running. And I just stood there in disbelief — that even though I have done all this work across Kentucky, even though I’m an elected official, they still saw me as a young Black man, and they still felt like it was justified to throw tear gas at me. It hurt.”McGrath’s critics say she has been a less visible presence at protests, though she has attended some. She’s also drawn criticism from her party’s far left wing for resisting policy proposals such as “Medicare for All.” And she’s not willing to call Trump a racist, even if she thinks his words and actions have been.Still, McGrath has not shied away from questions about race. In an interview, she called on white people to do more to fight systemic racism.“We need to stand up for what’s right and talk to other white people and call it out when we see it,” she said. “Whatever the solution is, we want to be part of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-candidates-tap-protest-energy-to-challenge-democrats/story-BudbO9iygUa2hiVnKEglUN.html

22-06-2020||World||Trump rejected PM Modi’s waiver case on Iran curbs, writes Bolton||US President Donald Trump had personally shut down a fierce debate among his aides in April 2019 on additional exemptions for countries like India from US sanctions on Iran oil purchases and ordered wavering officials to “go to zero”, former National Security Adviser John Bolton writes in his upcoming book.Bolton writes that Trump had pointedly “not been sympathetic” to India’s case as made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.These deliberations took place around April 18, and on April 21, the United States announced the end of waivers from secondary sanctions for countries that continued to buy Iranian crude, forcing India, a net importer of crude, and others impacted to look for new suppliers.Also read: Covid-19 pandemic - WHO reports largest single-day increase in coronavirus casesIt had not been an easy decision, according to Bolton, who gives a first peek at behind-the-scene discussions that had preceded, even though it’s tainted by his known hawkish stand on Iran.Trump had been “vibrating increasingly” on the end-the-waivers side of the scale, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo was “wobbly”, writes Bolton, and the state department officials were afflicted by “clientitis” - a phrase he uses to imply they were loyal to countries in their assignment portfolios and not the US.“But India is so important,” he writes, citing state department officials. Or, “Japan is so important.” Bolton says he could understand India’s case that it will not easily find an alternative supplier at the same low price Iran was charging. But its position was inconsistent with America’s, he argued.Also read: In a blow to Indians, Donald Trump says H-1B suspension coming any day nowTrump ended the discussions on April 18. “‘Go to zero,’” Bolton writes quoting the president, and goes on to add that “in a phone call with Pompeo, Trump had not been sympathetic to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi, saying, ‘He’ll be okay’”.Iran was the second-largest supplier of crude for India at the time and the sanctions significantly disrupted India’s oil supplies. But they left untouched Indian investments in Chabahar port in Iran, which provides India crucial trade routes into Afghanistan and up north Central Asian countries. India was indeed “okay” with the Trump administration’s decision, thus, and has since found other sellers, including the United States. India and a bunch of other countries, including US allies Japan and South Korea, were granted waivers from the first round of sanctions that went into effect in November 2018 following President Trump’s decision announced earlier in the year to withdraw the United States from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) signed in 2015 by the US, UK, France, Russia, China and the EU with Iran. It had ended UN-led sanctions, bolstered by US add-ons, in return for Iran mothballing its nuclear weapons programme.The former NSA has been surprisingly dismissive of the February-March 2019 crisis between India and Pakistan stemming from the capture of an Indian Air Force pilot by Pakistan, which the United States had waded into to prevent an escalation between two countries with nuclear arms.“After hours of phone calls, the crisis passed, perhaps because, in substance, there never really had been one,” Bolton writes nonchalantly of the crisis and the outcome negotiated by the US in the middle of Trump’s high-profile second summit with North Korea’s Kim Jong-Un. Trump had opened his post-summit news conference in Hanoi on March 2 saying he had some “decent news” that would end India-Pakistan tensions. The captured pilot crossed over at the Wagah border hours later.“But when two nuclear powers spin up their military capabilities, it is best not to ignore it,” he adds in the book, but essentially to reprise his well-known reservations about Trump’s outreach to Kim.On the other sanctions issue, stemming from the Countering American Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) that targets Russia and seeks to punish it by scaring away its major defence purchases with the threat of secondary sanctions, Bolton says the president had asked him to look into an article that said India was buying Russian S-400 missile defence system because it finds them better than the American Patriots.The US has offered Terminal High Altitude Area Defense systems (THAAD) and Patriot Advanced Capability missile defence system as an alternative to the S-400. But India is sticking with the Russian deal for now.The book also confirms Trump had been dismissive of the $3 billion Indian assistance in Afghanistan. “India builds a library and advertises it all over,” Bolton writes, quoting Trump. India has built and repaired many structures as part of its reconstruction efforts, but a library is not among them. The president might have been referring to the Afghan parliament India has constructed on the outskirts of Kabul.Bolton’s book, ‘The Room Where It Happened’, is based on his 16 months as Trump’s third National Security Adviser. The print edition is slated for release Tuesday, but pirated editions were available online over the weekend.The book has already generated a fair amount of interest and controversy, as reported by Hindustan Times earlier, with Bolton claiming President Trump pleaded with President Xi Jinping of China to help him win a second term and backed his repressive measures in Hong Kong and the concentration camps for Uyghur Muslims.Bolton also writes that Trump’s closest and loyal aides mocked him behind his back, such as Pompeo, who, the ex-NSA writes, passed him a note during a meeting with Kim, saying Trump is “full of s…”. Pompeo has denied it and called Bolton a “traitor”.Bolton has also been criticized by Trump critics for not coming out to testify during the president’s impeachment trial and that he sat it out for the sake of his lucrative book deal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-rejected-pm-modi-s-waiver-case-on-iran-curbs-writes-bolton/story-YfR0EAoon3gTU5eVfQKRCJ.html

US gold futures rose 0.8% to $1,766.90.“General risk aversion is helping the market, we are seeing pressure on growth exposed currencies and on share markets. Overall, there are concerns about increasing infection rates,” said Michael McCarthy, chief strategist at CMC Markets.“The market is concerned about the outlook for growth and that of course is supportive for gold.”The World Health Organization reported a record increase in global coronavirus cases on Sunday.Rising infections in the United States and elsewhere dented hopes for a quick economic recovery and weighed on investors’ appetite for riskier assets. Meanwhile, two Federal Reserve officials sounded increasing pessimism on the swiftness of any economic recovery from the virus and warned the unemployment rate could rise again if the disease is not brought under control.Geopolitical tensions also supported the safe-haven asset amid developments in Hong Kong, as details of a new national security law for the territory showed Beijing will have overarching powers over its enforcement.Indicative of sentiment, SPDR Gold Trust holdings rose 2% to 1,159.31 tonnes on Friday, while speculators increased their bullish positions in COMEX gold and silver contracts in the week to June 16.

22-06-2020||World||Worst North Korea economy in two decades pushing Kim Jong Un to lash out||Blowing up a building meant to symbolize friendship may have been North Korea’s forceful way of demanding help for an economy straining under international sanctions and borders shut by the coronavirus.The destruction of the $15 million facility paid for by South Korea in the North Korean border city of Kaesong was one of the biggest provocations Kim Jong Un’s regime has made against its neighbour in years.Kim Jong Un destroys joint Korea office in rebuke to SeoulSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in’s government has warned Kim against reckless provocations, but the destroying of the building so far hasn’t derailed plans in parliament to revive inter-Korean cooperation or attempts to persuade the Trump administration to loosen its stance on Pyongyang.As analysts struggle to reach a consensus on the logic behind the explosive move, the immediate result has been to inject urgency into talks between the US and South Korea over Pyongyang.Moon sent his nuclear envoy to Washington after the building came crashing down to speak with US officials about ways to deal with the current situation on the Korean Peninsula, the Foreign Ministry said last week. Lee Do-hoon returned home over the weekend but shared few details about the discussions with reporters at the airport, Yonhap News agency reported.The US and UN sanctions are aimed at getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons program.Any loosening of the restrictions on trade and transactions would bode well for North Korea because its economy now risks shrinking 6% this year, according to Fitch Solutions. That would be its worst contraction since 1997, when the country was stricken by famine.The heightened economic malaise compounds troubles faced by Kim after his nearly three-week absence from public events in April led to speculation about his health and questions about his grip on power.Trade with China, North Korea’s biggest economic partner, had already slowed to a trickle under the sanctions as President Xi Jinping also sought to rein in Kim’s nuclear ambitions.But the flow of goods hit a wall after Pyongyang sealed the country’s borders earlier this year to halt Covid-19. In both March and April, North Korea’s exports to China fell more than 90% from a year ago, China’s Customs General Administration reported.“The larger economic context certainly shows Pyongyang getting backed into a corner,” said Kyle Ferrier, director of academic affairs at the Korea Economic Institute of America. “Sanctions were clearly impacting the North Korean economy prior to Covid-19, but the closure of the border with China to curb the spread of the coronavirus has done much more to stymie the North Korean economy.”While the contraction may not seem large in a world where the virus has sent economies plummeting, North Korea is one of the planet’s poorest countries and can ill afford a turn for the worse.Money from South Korea would help. Due to the sanctions, trade between the neighbors has slowed to just $3.5 million through May of this year from $2.7 billion in 2015.Humanitarian assistance has also dried up under Trump’s maximum pressure sanctions campaign. South Korea has sent about $3 billion of aid since 1995, but only a total of $30 million came between 2017 and 2019, according to the latest government data.The liaison office was located near a joint factory park where South Korean firms once used cheap North Korean labor to manufacture goods. The intended model of economic cooperation earned North Korea an estimated $100 million a year.North Korea sent in troops to occupy the facility in 2016, during a previous snarling of tensions, and it remains shut under the sanctions.Sanctions bustingBefore the pandemic, North Korea had been getting better at poking holes in the sanctions regime through trading of contraband and restricted commodities on the high seas, UN Security Council reports have shown.It had also turned to cyber crime, taking in about $2 billion in 2019 through the worldwide theft of resources from the financial sector, according to testimony to a US House committee in June.But it also participated in negotiations aimed at easing sanctions through talks with long time friends China and Russia and foes including the US and South Korea.Following three summits with Trump since 2018 that produced no sanctions relief, North Korea earlier this month accused the US of breaking promises and said it saw no benefit in engaging with Washington.“The rapprochement efforts over the past years have not yielded much in terms of economic relief for North Korea,” said Anwita Basu, a Fitch analyst. “They have chosen an adversarial route arguably in hopes that South Korea might get bullied into helping them, but as always, such tactics could backfire.”Kim’s frustration shows in a recent series of threats against Moon, with the leader of North Korea’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, personally launching verbal attacks against a man she once hobnobbed with during her visit to Seoul in 2018.“Because North Korea’s economic downturn is fueling its aggression, and is worsened by sanctions, there are no near-term off-ramps here,” said Van Jackson, a former Pentagon official now teaching at Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand.“The reasoning that led North Korea to destroy the liaison office will lead them to engage in even more provocative behavior over the next year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/worst-north-korea-economy-in-two-decades-pushing-kim-jong-un-to-lash-out/story-ApQYf7sbzmVMdFkGuD4mzN.html

North Korea said it will fly propaganda leaflets and take other steps to nullify 2018 deals that were meant to ease military tensions at the border.Yoh Sangkey, a spokesman at Seoul’s Unification Ministry, told reporters that North Korea must suspend its plan to send anti-Seoul leaflets that “are not helpful to South-North (Korea) relations at all.” Earlier Monday, North Korea said it had manufactured 12 million propaganda leaflets to be floated toward South Korea aboard 3,000 balloons and other unspecified delivery equipment.“Our plan of distributing the leaflets against the enemy is an eruption of the unquenchable anger of all the people and the whole society,” the North’s official Korean Central News Agency said. “The time for retaliatory punishment is drawing near.” Some observers say ongoing weather conditions aren’t favorable for North Korea to fly balloons into the South so it may use drones to deliver the leaflets. They say this could trigger clashes between the Koreas because South Korea must respond to incoming drones to its territory.A South Korean activist recently said he would also drop about a million leaflets over the border around Thursday, the 70th anniversary of the start of the 1950-53 Korean War. South Korean officials have said they’ll ban civilian activists from launching balloons toward North Korea.Experts say North Korea is likely focusing on the South Korean civilian leafleting to boost its internal unity and apply more pressures on Seoul and Washington amid stalled nuclear diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/s-korea-urges-north-korea-not-to-send-leaflets-amid-high-tensions/story-QT1CFMX3ZCTmtJHewZRfJJ.html
22-06-2020||World||New Covid-19 hotspots are emerging in rural villages across India||After overwhelming India’s megacities, the coronavirus is now moving through the country’s vast hinterland.Home to nearly 70% of India’s 1.3 billion population, the nation’s villages have little access to health care and are struggling to support themselves through the country’s prolonged economic slowdown.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageInitially isolated from the epidemic that has swamped the capital New Delhi and financial center Mumbai, rural areas were exposed when millions of migrant workers who lost their jobs in the cities when the government implemented a strict nationwide lockdown on March 25 went home.The states of Bihar, Assam, Jharkhand, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh received the most number of returning laborers -- now they are also witnessing the sharpest rise in new cases in the two weeks to June 8, according to internal government estimates seen by Bloomberg. In the rural districts of Rajasthan and Karnataka, the virus is also spreading rapidly, it showed.Infections have now spread to 98 of the country’s 112 poorest rural districts, up from 34 on April 15, according to the report from NITI Aayog, the government’s planning body. Nearly 2,250 new cases were added in those districts.Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s administration runs the risk of a burgeoning death toll if the pandemic’s spread is not checked in rural India, where under-funded health care infrastructure and poor living conditions provide fertile ground for the virus. India is already the world’s fourth most affected country, and an exponential rise in cases in the villages could catapult it higher. With the crisis pushing the economy toward its first full-year contraction in more than four decades, the likelihood of increasing social unrest continues to grow.The Prime Minister’s Office didn’t respond to an email seeking comment for this story.‘Living in fear’In the agricultural Ganjam district in Odisha, the Choudhari Tikarapada village of 5,000 people was coronavirus free till the end of May.That all changed when about 200 laborers returned home to the area after they lost their jobs in the states of Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu during the lockdown. They were quarantined for seven days before entering the village. Soon after 13 were found Covid-19 positive, prompting the administration to declare it a containment zone, stopping any movement of people.“If tests are conducted in my village then more infected persons will be found,” said villager Sadananda Sahu, adding it is impossible to maintain social distancing and hygiene in his area. “We are living in fear.”Districts like Ganjam are among India’s poorest and have a skeletal health infrastructure, with most villagers accessing hospitals in nearby cities. Indis spent just 3.7% of gross domestic product on health care in 2016, putting it in the bottom 25 countries globally, according to the most recent World Bank data, leaving hospitals at risk of becoming quickly overwhelmed with virus cases.All 33 rural districts in Rajasthan have also been affected, after more than 1.1 million laborers from cities including Mumbai, Pune and Ahmedabad came home in May, said Raghu Sharma, the desert state’s health minister. “They came to their villages from highly infected places,” said Sharma. “Thus it spread in the villages of Rajasthan.”The state has set up quarantine facilities in each village, deployed senior level officials to monitor them and and formed village panels to check people’s movement, Sharma said. The state has enough isolation beds, ICU rooms, and personal protective equipment to deal with the situation and was ramping up testing capacity to 40,000 per day from current 25,250 over the next two weeks, he said.Low testing“Rural death rates for nearly all infectious conditions are considerably higher than in urban areas,” said Prabhat Jha, professor at the University of Toronto, citing a study. He called on the government to release all de-identified data on positive tests so epidemiologists can better understand how the virus is traveling through India. “Had the lockdown been a true lockdown, with workers not being kicked out of their urban places of residence, the problem would not have spread,” Jha said.India’s low testing rates over the last two months have added to the uncertainty. India had tested more than 6.8 million samples as of June 20, according to the Indian Council for Medical Research. The country has so far reported more than 410,000 infections and nearly 13,300 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.The eastern state of Jharkhand has about 1,500 confirmed cases. Just 117 are from urban centers, while the rest are from rural areas, which witnessed a surge following arrival of people from outside the state, said Nitin Kulkarni, secretary of the health department. The authorities have worked to stop the spread by isolating infected people at quarantine centers, Kulkarni said on June 11.About 5.7 million migrants have been shifted to various destinations across the country by special trains and a further 4.1 million by road transport, according to a government filing in the country’s top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-hotspots-are-emerging-in-rural-villages-across-india/story-j1IbU0uaZeGvnF7rxj4X8M.html
22-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Cases, infection curve and fatalities in 7 high caseload countries||The coronavirus disease has been spreading rapidly across the world since the outbreak was first reported in China late last year. After China, the Sars-CoV-2 pathogen, which causes a respiratory disease, severely affected the United States and other European country.Among the countries hit early by the spread of the coronavirus disease was Iran. The virus hit the country in February and since then, Iran has struggled to contain the outbreak.Italy was hit the hardest by the spread if the coronavirus disease in Europe. Here is a look at the countries with the highest caseload of the Covid-19 and the latest situation there:United States: The US is the hardest-hit where the pandemic has infected more than 2.2 million people in the United States, claiming around 1,20,000 lives and infections are rising in many parts of the country. The US diagnosed its first Covid-19 case in Washington state on January 20. The curve of the infection has been steeply rising in the US since the month of April, though some governors of states claim the rate of infection has slowed down. The highest fatalities have been in New York.Brazil: The Latin American country is the world’s number 2 coronavirus hotspot after the United States. It officially passed 50,000 coronavirus deaths on Sunday. Brazil has already seen its Covid-19 tally rise to more than one million cases. Brazil confirmed its first case of the novel coronavirus on February 26. Experts say the true numbers are a lot higher because of a lack of widespread testing.Russia: The country reported 7,728 new cases of the novel coronavirus on Sunday, pushing its nationwide case tally to 5,84,680. Russia’s coronavirus response centre said that 109 people had died in the last 24 hours, bringing the official death toll in the country to 8,111.United Kingdom: Britain has one of the highest death tolls in the world from Covid-19, but the number of cases has been steadily falling in recent weeks. The death toll rose by 43 to 42,632, one of the lowest increases since the lockdown was imposed in March. Prime Minister Boris Johnson will unveil the latest easing of Britain’s coronavirus lockdown on Tuesday.Peru: The coronavirus has been rapidly spreading in the Latin American region. Peru has been one of the hardest hit countries, with the country logging close to 2.5 lakh cases. The disease has killed close to 8,000 people in the country Peru has adopted some of Latin America’s earliest and most stringent measures, but these have failed to check the spread of Covid-19.Italy: This European country on Sunday reported 224 new coronavirus cases 24 deaths in the past day, bringing its official death toll in the pandemic to 34,634. It is among the 10 worst-affected countries by the coronavirus pandemic. The total number of cases in Italy is 2,38,275, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO).Iran: Iran reported its first coronavirus cases on February 19 and has since struggled to contain the outbreak, the deadliest in the Middle East. Iranian health authorities reported over 100 new deaths from the novel coronavirus Sunday for the third day running, pushing up the overall number to 9,623. Iran recorded its lowest single-day death toll in early May, before seeing a new rise in cases in recent weeks. The total number of infections in Iran is 2,04,952.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-cases-infection-curve-and-fatalities-in-7-high-caseload-countries/story-YGWupTnh18XAfe5aGSVb8I.html

It is the right decision and the right time to remove this problematic statue.” The museum’s president, Ellen Futter, told the New York Times that the museum’s “community has been profoundly moved by the ever-widening movement for racial justice that has emerged after the killing of George Floyd.” “We have watched as the attention of the world and the country has increasingly turned to statues as powerful and hurtful symbols of systemic racism,” Futter told the Times.Officials said it hasn’t been determined when the Roosevelt statue will be removed and where it will go.“The composition of the Equestrian Statue does not reflect Theodore Roosevelt’s legacy,” Theodore Roosevelt IV, a great-grandson of the president, said in a statement to the Times. “It is time to move the statue and move forward.” Futter said the museum objects to the statue but not to Roosevelt, a pioneering conservationist whose father was a founding member of the institution and who served as New York’s governor before becoming the 26th president.She said the museum is naming its Hall of Biodiversity for Roosevelt “in recognition of his conservation legacy.” In 2017, protesters splashed red liquid on the statue’s base to represent blood and published a statement calling for its removal as an emblem of “patriarchy, white supremacy and settler-colonialism.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/museum-to-remove-roosevelt-statue-decried-as-white-supremacy/story-qIdcXvHRJRwS1KAWkyZqQM.html

Of the 3,748 employees tested, 481 tested positive for Covid-19, and 455 were asymptomatic.There have been several other Covid-19 outbreaks at Tyson plants around the United States, including in North Carolina, Nebraska, and Iowa.In November, China lifted a five-year ban on US poultry. China had blocked US poultry imports a month after an outbreak of avian influenza in December 2014, closing off a market that brought more than $500 million worth of American chicken, turkey and other poultry products in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hundreds-test-positive-for-coronavirus-at-tyson-foods-plant-in-arkansas/story-lELT9Y0uUX4ViVcafO0bnO.html

But over the weekend, it was available in ways even his publisher is hoping to prevent.A PDF of “The Room Where It Happened” has turned up on the internet, offering a free, pirated edition of the former national security adviser’s scathing takedown of President Donald Trump, who has alleged that the book contains classified material that never should have been released.“We are working assiduously to take down these clearly illegal instances of copyright infringement,” Simon & Schuster spokesperson Adam Rothberg said Sunday.Piracy has long been a top concern among publishers, especially in the digital age, although the actual impact on sales is undetermined. “The Room Where It Happened” has been No. 1 for days on the Amazon.com bestseller list. The Associated Press was among several news outlets that obtained early copies of the book and reported on its contents.On Saturday, a federal judge ruled that Simon & Schuster could publish the book despite the Trump administration’s contention that it compromised national security. “The Room Where It Happened” was originally scheduled for March, but was delayed twice as the White House reviewed the manuscript.Bolton’s legal team has said that he spent months addressing White House concerns about classified information and that Bolton had been assured in late April by the official he was working with that the manuscript no longer contained any such material.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pirated-editions-of-john-bolton-s-memoir-appear-online/story-dmOffAS5g51ANEtSaNkueK.html
22-06-2020||World||Long-dreaded increase in Covid-19 cases hits Iraq amid severe economic crisis||In Baghdad’s vast exhibition grounds, masked workers lugged hospital beds into rows for makeshift coronavirus wards, as doctors and officials sounded the alarm Sunday over a surge in virus cases in the capital. The long-dreaded scenario is gripping the country amid a severe economic crisis brought on by plummeting oil prices. But with a widening budget deficit, doctors are running low on medical equipment, including key protective gear. A cap on new hires is also expected to strain the already over-stretched system.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here  As hospitals overflowed with patients, the Iraqi government announced temporary field hospitals will open throughout Baghdad, where infections are highest, to cope with the exponentially rising number of virus patients. Iraq’s health system was already battered by years of conflict as well as poor infrastructure and lack of funds. Work to erect the field hospital in the fair grounds began Saturday, and it will eventually provide beds for 400 men and 100 women. When the supply of hospital cots ran out, workers brought in metal-framed single beds. “God willing, there will be future plans to increase the number of beds and field hospitals,” said Mouhamed Bander, an engineer with the Al-Aqiq institution for charity. His organization set up the wards in tandem with the ministries of health and trade. Virus cases began rising after the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, when families and friends typically get together to break the daylong fast. In less than a month, infections spiked seven-fold to over 30,868 as of Sunday, up from less than 4,000 at the end of May. Deaths also spiked, with over 1,100 killed among the confirmed cases, according to Health Ministry figures. Among the recent dead was legendary Iraqi soccer star Ahmed Radhi, 56, who died Sunday due to virus complications after fighting for over a week. He was beloved for scoring his country’s first and only World Cup goal in 1986, and was also a political figure. Iraq qualified for the World Cup just once, and Radhi’s goal is a source of pride for Iraqis, many of whom mourned his death on social media.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage  The troubling increase in cases was due to more testing, but also a lack of public adherence to government measures, said Health Ministry spokesman Saif al-Badr. Testing increased from nearly 4,000 a day last month to over 13,000 in recent days. By next week, he said 20,000 samples will be examined daily. Iraq took drastic measures to stem the virus’s spread, including closing schools, restaurants, public gatherings and international borders. Despite the additional field hospitals in place, doctors on the front lines fear these measures won’t be enough to absorb the rising number of infections. Doctors said the Health Ministry relies heavily on rapid blood tests to identify the first signs of infection. If these are positive, swabs are taken to confirm whether it’s coronavirus using specialized testing kits. But blood tests are known to produce false positives. “Its overcrowding hospitals,” said a doctor in Baghdad. “It’s chaos.” The Iraqi health care workers and health officials all spoke on condition of anonymity because of recent measures by the ministry prohibiting them from talking to reporters. The manager of a hospital in the southern city of Karbala, which reached capacity this week, ordered staff not to conduct tests if symptoms weren’t present because “there are no more beds to admit people,” a doctor there said. Still, many with no apparent symptoms do have the virus. All of the health workers interviewed said they’d purchased their own protective equipment because hospital supplies were running low. “We are in a fog, we don’t know what is going on,” said the doctor in Karbala, who said they’d asked their hospital for gloves, masks and protective suits, but were told these had run out. Doctors in Basra and Baghdad cited similar issues. “The numbers concern us,” said a doctor in a major Baghdad hospital dealing with virus patients. “And we are already overstretched.” A senior official said the Health Ministry is in dire need of funds. But a budget hasn’t been approved by the government, which is grappling with severe shortfalls in the wake of falling oil prices. Iraq depends on crude exports to fund nearly 90% of state revenue. Allocations to the ministry are made on a month-to-month basis. “We need a budget twice the size of the previous budget,” said the official. But officials from the prime minister’s office said funds allocated to the Health Ministry also weren’t being spent efficiently. “The problem is logistics management, the network is weak,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity in line with regulations. The official said multiple layers of central purchasing committees within the Health Ministry and in directorates across provinces are responsible for making purchases, instead of allowing hospitals to source materials directly. The ministry is also unable to make new hires, which are essential to cope with the rising number of cases. Recent graduates have been asked to volunteer their services until a state budget is approved. The move has sparked young doctors to lash out on social media. “I graduated in 2019 and the Iraqi government has prevented me and more than 2,200 newly graduated Iraqi doctors from practicing medicine,” said Dua’a al-Jarjees. Meanwhile, case numbers continue to rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/long-dreaded-increase-in-covid-19-cases-hits-iraq-amid-severe-economic-crisis/story-Am2b7KvRn9b7nIAhyO0nOO.html
22-06-2020||World||Injuries at US protests draw scrutiny to use of police weaponry||In law enforcement, they’re referred to as “nonlethal” tools for dealing with demonstrations that turn unruly: rubber bullets, pepper spray, batons, flash-bangs. But the now-familiar scenes of US police officers in riot gear clashing with protesters at Lafayette Park across from the White House and in other cities have police critics charging that the weaponry too often escalates tensions and hurts innocent people. “When you see riot gear, it absolutely changes the mood,” said Ron Moten, a longtime community organizer in the nation’s capital who was out demonstrating this weekend. He said it takes away any perception the officers could be empathetic. “If I went up to speak with a police officer and I’m covered in armour and holding a shield and a stick, don’t you think they would regard me as a threat?” “When we see riot gear, as black people it takes us back 400 years,” he said. Protesters in Denver arrived at the hospital with injuries from police projectiles that caused one person to lose an eye and left three other people with permanent eye damage, said Prem Subramanian, a physician who operated on some victims following demonstrations late last month. “They weren’t accused of any crime, and they came in with devastating eye injuries,” Subramanian said, adding that he was so upset about it that he complained to city officials, who promised to investigate any abuses. “We’re learning the consequences of using these weapons.” He said the injuries rivaled what he saw treating shrapnel damage to eyes of soldiers at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center who were injured by explosives in Iraq and Afghanistan. Rubber bullets and similar projectiles have damaged eyes or blinded at least 20 individuals from ages 16 to 59, according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, since protests began over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Other tactics were on display at Lafayette Park, where police used chemical agents to break up a peaceful protest minutes before President Donald Trump posed for pictures outside a nearby church this month. In Buffalo, an officer used a baton to shove a 75-year-old man to the ground before that officer and others marched past as blood collected beneath the man’s head. Amnesty International has questioned whether equipping officers “in a manner more appropriate for a battlefield may put them in the mindset that confrontation and conflict are inevitable.” The growing use of less lethal weapons is “cause for grave concern” and may sometimes violate international law, said Agnes Callamard, director of Global Freedom of Expression at Columbia University and a U.N. adviser. She said the “basic rationale for less lethal weaponry is legitimate” after courts called for law enforcement agents to be given equipment enabling them to respond proportionately when necessary. In 1990, the United Nations issued basic principles on their use. Projectiles caused 53 deaths and 300 permanent disabilities among 1,984 serious injuries recorded by medical workers in over a dozen countries from 1990 to 2015, said Rohini Haar, an emergency room doctor in Oakland, California, and primary author of the 2016 Physicians for Human Rights report assembled with civil rights groups. She said there “are so many cases of misuse, it seems almost impossible to use them correctly.” Whether rubber, foam or bean bags, they exit guns with the force of a bullet and should not be used against protesters because they can maim and bounce or ricochet unpredictably, Haar said. Police, private security forces and military units seek to cause pain or incapacitate individuals with more than 75 types of rubber or plastic bullets from manufacturers in countries including the US, Brazil, China, Israel, South Africa and South Korea, according to the report, “Lethal in Disguise.” Wade Carpenter, police chief in Park City, Utah, said the tools are necessary when peaceful rallies are “hijacked by individuals that have come in with a nefarious purpose to create the riots, the looting, those type of things.”Many police forces “are very stringent on their training,” said Carpenter, an official with the International Association of Chiefs of Police, which has 32,000 police official members in 167 countries. “They’re very accountable, and others, you know, it’s kind of all over the board.” Officers target lawbreakers who attack police with bricks or baseball bats, but sometimes less-than-lethal options are “not perfectly accurate, so, that’s always a risk and those are calculated risks,” Carpenter said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/injuries-at-us-protests-draw-scrutiny-to-use-of-police-weaponry/story-PRdOzBrrOUeRUUEkVu5inJ.html
22-06-2020||World||Drug check in Germany’s Stuttgart sparks attacks on police, vandalism||Police in the German city of Stuttgart said Sunday that 24 people were arrested and 19 police officers injured after a check for drugs sparked attacks on officers and police vehicles followed by widespread vandalism of storefronts in the city center. Police said several hundred people were involved.The disturbance started after officers stopped a 17-year-old on suspicion of drug possession as several hundred people partied outside around 11:30 pm Saturday, police said. Bystanders started throwing stones and bottles, and smaller groups ran through surrounding streets breaking shop windows, according to police.Police said 40 businesses were vandalized and nine of them had been looted, while 12 police vehicles were damaged before officers brought the situation under control around 4 am.Only one of the injured officers was seriously hurt enough to be considered unable to work, police said.Police officials said at a news conference that the violence had no apparent political motivation. They said the teen suspect initially stopped was a white German citizen. Of the two dozen people arrested, half held German passports and half were citizens of other countries.Stuttgart Mayor Fritz Kuhn, a member of the environmentalist Greens party, called the attacks on police “unacceptable.” He said that more people were on the street on Saturday night because many clubs and discos remain closed due to the coronavirus outbreak and that the party scene in a central park had drawn people from the surrounding area.“One cause was likely alcohol, another the addiction to social media film clips,” Kuhn said.Cellphone video purporting to be of the events circulated widely on social media. Police asked witnesses to upload videos that could provide evidence to assist their investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/drug-check-in-germany-s-stuttgart-sparks-attacks-on-police-vandalism/story-tIbN6SqVWtcPr2LheeiNaO.html
22-06-2020||World||US economy doing ‘amazingly’ well, says Trump||The US economy is doing “amazingly” well, President Donald Trump has said, stressing that America is witnessing “record-setting” numbers in terms of jobs.Trump made the comments on Saturday while responding to a question on the US economy, which has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic.The country’s unemployment rate for April was 14.7 per cent, which was the highest since 1948. With the addition of 2.5 million jobs, the monthly rate dropped to 13.3 per cent for May.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe economy had lost 22.1 million jobs in March and April when most parts of the US were under lockdown due to the coronavirus outbreak. In May, some businesses have reopened and rehiring of workers has picked up. Trump had described the numbers as an affirmation of the good work his administration is doing.“The US economy is doing amazingly well,” Trump told reporters.“I would say that the numbers that we’re doing are record-setting numbers. We have record-setting job numbers,” he said.“We have record-setting, as you know, retail sales numbers; that just came out. The US economy is doing very, very well,” Trump asserted.Earlier Kevin Hassett, senior adviser to the president and former chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers at the White House, told CNN that the country’s economy is coming back way faster than one thought.“Right now I think economists need to be humble and recognise that when we’ve got 17 states where credit card spending is above where it was last year already, that it suggests that this economy is really, really coming back way faster than I thought,” Hassette said.At the same time, he conceded that the economy would be hit if there was to be a second wave of the coronavirus. “If there is a second flare-up that’s, you know, bigger than what we’ve seen and the economy does have to move towards more shutdown,” he said.President Trump is focused on building a great economy, the strongest economy that the US has ever had, he told reporters at the White House on Friday.“I think that he had an enormous amount of success doing that through January. I think that the virus has upended that. But the comeback is way faster than anybody thought. Again, the average economist missed by ten million jobs in the last jobs report. And I think the reason why we’re coming back so fast is that the economy was so strong in January,” he said.“I’ve not ever had him say, oh we need to do this because I want to win the election. I have never heard him say that once,” he said responding to a question.Trump is seeking his re-election to the White House in the November 3 elections.The US is the worst-affected country from the pandemic.According to the Johns Hopkins University data, there are over 2.2 million coronavirus cases in America with more than 119,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-economy-doing-amazingly-well-says-trump/story-dWwaeQp2z90yclWDnH9JqJ.html

22-06-2020||World||Joe Biden is ‘helpless puppet’ of radical left, says Trump||US President Donald Trump has kicked off his re-election campaign with a rally in Oklahoma where he launched a frontal attack on his Democratic opponent Joe Biden, describing him as a “helpless puppet” of the radical left. Trump, 74, is pitted against former vice president and Democratic Party’s presidential nominee Biden, 77, in the November 3 presidential election. As per the latest opinion polls, he is trailing behind Biden on an average by eight percentage points. Trump, in his address to the thousands of his supporters at an indoor stadium in Oklahoma’s Tulsa city on Saturday, said: “Biden is a helpless puppet of the radical left. And he’s not radical left. I don’t think he knows what he is any more. But he’s controlled by the radical left”. Addressing his first election rally after the coronavirus pandemic hit the country early this year, killing more than 119,000 Americans in a matter of few months and bringing the economy to a standstill, Trump alleged that the Biden campaign staff even donated a lot of money to bail out rioters, looters and arsonists who ravaged Minneapolis. Minneapolis erupted into violence following the brutal custodial death of African-American George Floyd on May 25. The protests spread nationwide and turned violent in many places including Washington DC, New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. The president has accused radical left for the violence. “The left is trying to do everything they can to stop us every hour of every day including violence, mayhem, look what happened tonight. But we will never submit to their threats and we will never let them destroy our nation,” Trump said. In his speech that lasted for more than 100 minutes, Trump talked a lot on his favorite themes: fake news, energy dominance, appointing judges, supporting police and condemning protesters. “The unhinged left-wing mob is trying to vandalise our history, desecrating beautiful monuments, tear down our statues and punish, cancel and persecute anyone who does not conform to their demands for absolute and total control, we’re not conforming. “That’s why we’re here actually. This cruel campaign of censorship and exclusion violates everything we hold dear as Americans. They want to demolish our heritage so that they can impose their new oppressive regime in its place. They want to defund and dissolve our police departments. Think of that,” said the president. Addressing the rally comprising thousands of his supporters, a majority of whom did not wear face masks or maintain social distancing, Trump called for a legislation that would punish burning American flags with one-year imprisonment. “We ought to do it. We talk about freedom of speech… but that’s desecration,” he said. His political opponents accused him of risking people’s health by holding such a big rally. Many said that parts of the arena were empty. As a precautionary measure, local police officials and campaign staff measured the temperature of everyone entering the arena. Six members of the campaign staff tested positive with COVID-19 before the rally. There was brief interruption during his speech when he paused and called for doctors, as security guards went to the aid of a young man who appeared to have fainted. He was helped out by a security guard on either side. “Thank you. These people, I mean some of the people are waiting for five days, especially at this location, right? You take your time,” Trump said. Around 15 per cent of the city’s 400,000 residents are black, according to the US media report. Outside the arena, a 62-year-old peaceful protester was arrested and dragged by security personnel while wearing a shirt that read “I can’t breathe.” Tulsa Police Department said that the protestor was removed at the request of the Trump campaign staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-is-helpless-puppet-of-radical-left-says-trump/story-1Cmpc0jTsoetggJDJkTDlI.html
