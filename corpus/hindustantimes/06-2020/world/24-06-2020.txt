The Indian embassy later tweeted that the Defence Minister was accompanied by Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar, Vice Admiral Hari Kumar and Ambassador D B Venkatesh Varma. The Tri-Service contingent of the Indian Armed Forces comprised 75 all ranks and marched along with contingents of Russian Armed Forces and 17 other countries, according to an official statement.The British Indian Armed Forces during World War-II were one of the largest Allied Forces contingents which took part in the North and East African Campaign, Western Desert Campaign and the European Theatre against the Axis powers. This campaign witnessed sacrifice by over 87,000 Indian servicemen beside 34,354 being wounded, the statement said.The Indian Military not only fought on all fronts, but also ensured delivery of goods along the Southern, Trans-Iranian Lend-Lease route, along which weapons, ammunitions, spare parts for equipment and food went to the Soviet Union, Iran and Iraq, it said.On Tuesday, Singh called on Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov and the two leaders held discussions on the bilateral relationship, regional issues, and reviewed the India-Russia defence cooperation.Singh also conveyed his greetings for the solemn ceremonies of the 75th Victory Day and congratulated the “friendly” people of Russia, specially the veterans, who have contributed to the common security of India and Russia, the statement said on Tuesday.The parade was reviewed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, war veterans and guests, including Defence Minister Singh.This year, 14,000 troops and several hundred military machines took part in the parade, including 30 historic T-34 tanks. Modern vehicles also participated, including AFV Terminator, T-72, and T-14 Armata tanks, 9K720 Iskander missile systems, and many other cutting-edge military hardware, Sputnik International reported.Planes and helicopters also participated in an air parade, with Su-25s colouring the sky in white, blue, and red - the colours of the Russian flag, the report added.President Putin congratulated the military and guests, saying this victory determined the future of the planet. Russia postponed its military parade traditionally held on Moscow’s Red Square on May 9 for a later date due to the coronavirus pandemic.On May 26, President Putin announced that the Victory Parade would be held on Moscow’s Red Square on June 24.He explained that this was chosen because on June 24, 1945 the legendary historic parade of victors took place, when soldiers, who fought for Moscow and defended Leningrad, who stood their ground for Stalingrad, liberated Europe and stormed Berlin, marched on Red Square.Singh is the first senior union minister to undertake a foreign visit in four months as international travels were restricted due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-military-contingent-participates-in-victory-day-parade-in-russia/story-ebhDHzP0Mk8cSkCCyhqKRJ.html

24-06-2020||World||US says Masood Azhar enjoys ‘state protection’ in Pakistan||The United States on Wednesday said in a rare instance of such direct finger-pointing that Jaish-e-Mohammad founder Masood Azhar and 2008 Mumbai attack mastermind Sajid Mir were “widely believed” to be living “under the protection of the state” in Pakistan, which, additionally, had still not taken “decisive actions” against terrorists based on its soil.The United State has pushed Pakistan for long through threats and appeals to arrest and prosecute terrorists sheltered there and in the state department’s 2019 country reports on terrorism released Wednesday, it welcomed the prosecution of Hafiz Saeed, the founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba, in 2019, along with 12 associates.But Pakistan has made “no effort to use domestic authorities to prosecute” other terrorist figures such as Azhar and Mir, “both of whom are widely believed to reside in Pakistan under the protection of the state, despite government denials”, the repot added.JeM claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terrorist attack in February 2019, that led to significant escalation in tensions between the two nuclear power neighbors. India carried out a retaliatory strike on a JeM camp in Balakot, Pakistan hit back with an air raid, that led to the first air battle between the two air forces in decades. It was rare for the United States to have so very directly accused Pakistan of not only looking the other way as these two terrorists have lived and thrived there, but also of providing them state protection, which had been long apparent to most South Asian officials and experts.The United States has bene critical of Pakistan for yers now for allowing terrorists sheltering on tis soil to operate against India to the east and Pakistan to the west, and had gone so far as to say the Haqqani Network, of the Afghan Taliban, was a “veritable arm” of the Pakistani intelligence agency, the ISI.But accusing Pakistan of providing state protection to Azhar and Mir and their likes, is unusual, but not enough. “The United State has known of the presence in Pakistan of jihadi leaders who operate in India and Afghanistan but wants to keep its channel of communication open with Pakistan which is why it has not used the kind of firm language that it uses about other countries,” said Husain Haqqani, the former US ambassador to Pakistan who now lives in the US.Hafiz Saeed’s arrest and prosecution, for the ninth time, in 2019, had come under intense global pressure as Pakistan had faced with the possibility of being blacklisted at the initiative of the US by a global watchdog on terror financing and money-laundering, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force.Pakistan narrowly escaped then, but has remained in the dock, as the US terror report reminded. “The FATF expressed serious concern at its October 2019 plenary about Pakistan’s continued deficiencies but noted it had made some progress and extended the deadline for full Action Plan implementation to February 2020.” A final call is expected later in the year, in October.But in the US state department’s assessment, Pakistan still has much to show and improve. “Pakistan continued to serve as a safe haven for certain regionally focused terrorist groups.,” the report said, adding, “It allowed groups targeting Afghanistan, including the Afghan Taliban and affiliated HQN, as well as groups targeting India, including LeT and its affiliated front organizations, and JeM, to operate from its territory.The report acknowledged that Pakistan had made “some” and “modest” progress on countering terrorism, “the most difficult aspects of its 2015 National Action Plan to counter terrorism remains unfulfilled – specifically its pledge to dismantle all terrorist organizations without delay and discrimination”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-masood-azhar-enjoys-state-protection-in-pakistan/story-Q5StShJZy73Bp1bTSGdr5L.html
24-06-2020||World||Timeline to disaster: The last moments PIA’s Flight 8303||An initial report into the crash of Pakistan International Airlines Flight 8303 has outlined a devastating series of events before the plane plunged into a crowded Karachi neighbourhood, killing 97 people aboard and a child on the ground.Here is a look at what led to the disaster:Also read: Pilots on Pak plane that crashed were ‘discussing coronavirus during landing’Uneventful at firstThe skies were clear and conditions ideal when the aircraft left Lahore at 1:05 pm on May 22, with the accident report calling the plane’s departure and cruising flight “uneventful”. But as the flight approached Karachi, things went awry. The aircraft was too high as it neared Jinnah International Airport, leading pilots to disengage the autopilot and take manual control.The tower repeatedly tried to intervene -- calling on the pilots to abort their approach due to the plane’s excess altitude -- but the pilots attempted to land anyway.Inexplicably, at 1,740 feet (530 metres), they raised the landing gear and also deactivated speed brakes, while ignoring a series of alarms in the cockpit.Engines scraped tarmacThe pilots attempted to touch down without the plane’s landing gear extended, scraping the aircraft’s engines across the tarmac, and “initiated a braking action” before abruptly aborting the landing attempt, the report said.CCTV images released with the report showed sparks flying across the runway as the engines scraped the ground.The tower failed to communicate this information to the flight crew or alert emergency services to the problem.The pilots tried to circle back for a second attempt, but the engines -- badly damaged -- lost power, and the pilots issued a “mayday” call.‘Overconfident pilots’The plane then plunged into a nearby residential area and exploded on impact, killing all but two people aboard and a girl on the ground.Investigators said there was no technical issue with the plane, and the government blamed the pilots.Pakistan’s aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan lambasted the crew, saying the pilots were chatting about the coronavirus epidemic rather than following standard flight protocols.He said they were “overconfident”.The country’s deadliest aviation accident in eight years came just days after flights resumed following weeks of inaction due to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/timeline-to-disaster-the-last-moments-pia-s-flight-8303/story-oEJCJxFMDQa69sA0dNpetI.html
24-06-2020||World||First vaccinations begin in Africa for Covid-19 trial||Africa’s first participation in a Covid-19 vaccine trial started Wednesday as volunteers received injections developed at the University of Oxford in Britain, while officials said the continent of 1.3 billion people cannot be left behind.The large-scale trial is being conducted in South Africa, Britain and Brazil. South Africa has nearly one-third of Africa’s confirmed cases with more than 106,000, including more than 2,100 deaths. The country late Tuesday reported its biggest one-day death toll of 111.The African continent now has nearly 325,000 cases as countries loosen restrictions under economic pressure from citizens who say they have to feed their families. Shortages of testing materials and medical supplies remain a problem as Africa could become the world’s next hot spot.The pandemic was delayed in Africa “but is picking up speed very quickly,” the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief John Nkengasong said Wednesday, with a steep increase in the number of cases and deaths.“Unless we act now, Africa is at risk of being left behind on the global vaccine,” he warned a continental discussion and urged that local manufacturing and scientific expertise play a key role.Cameroon, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and South Africa all have highly developed clinical trial capabilities, said Salim Abdool Karim, chair of South Africa’s ministerial advisory committee for Covid-19.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged that the initial supply of any Covid-19 vaccine be deployed where it’s most needed, rather than based on the “ability to pay.” Tedros also announced that as of this week, all 54 of Africa’s countries now have the lab capacity to test for the coronavirus.In February, just two African nations could test for the virus. The continent’s first virus case was reported on Feb. 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-vaccinations-begin-in-africa-for-covid-19-trial/story-GbpKyZupUCdUzN0JOqE1dI.html

That’s very disturbing to me.”The total of reported new cases shot up to 34,720 on Tuesday taking the total to 2.34 million, according to the Johns Hopkins Institute tracker, and fatalities went up by 826 to 121,225.Texas and California reported more than 5,000 new cases each Tuesday, surpassing their recent peaks and Arizona, where President Donald Trump addressed an election rally Tuesday, reported more than 3,500 to take the total over 58,000.New York New Jersey and Connecticut, the triangle no northeaster states that had been the epicenter of the outbreak earlier and have since improved drastically, announced Wednesday mandatory two-week quarantine for people traveling from Florida, Texas and Arizona, southern states in the grip of the new surge.Twenty-six states, all in the south and the west, reported more cases last week than the one before. Arizona has been the worst hit, with cases said to be spiraling out of control since its Republican governor ended stay-at-home restrictions last month. And participants at Trump’s rally displayed a similar disregard for social distancing and preventive measures such as masks that the president has continued to show publicly.Fauci and Brett Giroir, a top health department official who also testified along with CDC’s Robert Redfield and FDA’s Stephen Kahn, told lawmakers the new surge of cases was due to increased community transmission. And that the next weeks will be crucial in how the country deals with them“We have all done the best that we can do to tackle this virus and the reality is that it’s brought this nation to its knees,” Redfield told the congressional committeeAll four officials denied, however, ever being told to slow-down testing as has been stated by the president, starting with his speech at the thinly attended election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma Monday. He had said he ordered for the testing to be slowed down as they only showed increase in cases.His aides claimed the president was joking, which he has denied.“None of us have ever been told to slow down on testing,” Fauci told lawmakers when asked. “That just is a fact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-surging-officials-say-it-could-worsen/story-aghQsXjAXn9eCUjzbnkmOL.html

Let’s pray for them. May the help of God and our brothers give them strength and support. Brothers and sisters, I am very close to you,” he said at his weekly general audience.It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico.In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-due-to-earthquake-in-mexico-rises-to-6-hundreds-of-home-damaged/story-6bGBrP1oNqke9LtvnPNA5H.html
24-06-2020||World||UK court to rule on divided Hinduja family’s assets||A judgement of the high court of England and Wales on Tuesday revealed a split in the Hinduja family on the issue of dividing the assets of its business empire ranging across continents, with Srichand, the eldest, ranged against three brothers, Gopichand, Prakash and Ashok.Srichand, 84, is ailing due to age-related diseases, and being unable to conduct proceedings in court, is represented by his daughter, Vinoo Hinduja. At the centre of the row are two letters of July 1 and 2, 2014, signed by Srichand and the three brothers.According to the latest Sunday Times Rich List, the Hinduja family is worth £16 billion. The three brothers, according to the ruling, rely on Srichand’s lack of capacity to seek control of the Hinduja Bank which is in his sole name.The court has been asked to determine the validity and effect of the letters. The July 2 letter includes statements to the effect, among other things, that the brothers appoint each other as their executors, and that assets held in any single brother’s name belong to all four.The letters also state that Gopichand, Prakash and Ashok are authorised to carry out all steps to implement the other letter. But Srichand sought a declaration that neither document has legal effect, whether as a will, power of attorney, declaration of trust or other binding document, or alternatively that the documents are revocable and have been revoked.According to the judgement, Srichand made a witness statement in July 2016 that the July letter does not reflect his wishes and that the family’s assets should be separated. The court accepted that Vinoo Hinduja is appointed by him as his ‘litigation friend’ to act on his behalf.The three brothers (Gopichand, Prakash, Ashok) said in a statement on Wednesday: “It will be apparent from the Judgment of the High Court in England that Mr S P Hinduja’s health has been deteriorating for a number of years suffering from Lewy Body disease, which is a form of dementia”.“Vinoo, his younger daughter, acting as his Litigation Friend is bringing these proceedings on his behalf. It is very unfortunate that these proceedings are taking place as they go against our Founder’s and family’s values and principles that have stood for many decades, especially, ‘everything belongs to everyone and nothing belongs to anyone’. We intend to defend the claim to uphold these dearly held family values”.“We would also stress that this litigation will not have any impact on our global businesses, which will continue to function as they have been. We hope you will understand that these are private family matters which are now the subject of litigation and we cannot comment any further”, their statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-court-to-rule-on-divided-hinduja-family-s-assets/story-6WEcU0UgsCz8RNTioWhCHK.html
24-06-2020||World||Herd immunity threshold could be lower than previously thought: Study||Herd immunity to Covid-19, which happens when so many people in a community become immune to the disease that it stops spreading, could be achieved with fewer people being infected than previously estimated, according to a new study. Scientists, including those from the University of Nottingham in the UK, noted that herd immunity develops when individuals contracting the disease build up natural immunity, and by people receiving a vaccine. They explained that when a large percentage of the population becomes immune to a disease, the spread of the disease slows down or stops and the chain of transmission is broken. In the current study, published in the journal Science, the researchers devised a mathematical model categorising people into groups reflecting age and social activity level to determine the threshold of the population that needed to be immune for herd immunity to develop. When they factored in differences in age and social activity in the model, they found that the herd immunity level reduced from 60 to 43 per cent. The 43 per cent figure, according to the scientists, should be interpreted as an illustration rather than an exact value, or even a best estimate. For Covid-19, they said herd immunity is often stated as around 60 per cent, a figure derived from the fraction of the population that must be vaccinated in advance of an epidemic to prevent a large outbreak. This figure assumes that each individual in the population is equally likely to be vaccinated, and hence immune, the scientists explained. However, they said this is not the case if immunity arises as a result of disease spreading in a population consisting of people with many different behaviours. “By taking this new mathematical approach to estimating the level for herd immunity to be achieved we found it could potentially be reduced to 43 per cent and that this reduction is mainly due to activity level rather than age structure,” explained study co-author Frank Ball from the University of Nottingham. According to the scientists, the more socially active individuals are, the more likely they are to get infected, than the less socially active ones -- and they are also more likely to infect people if they become infected. The researchers said the herd immunity level is lower when immunity is caused by disease spreading than when immunity comes from vaccination.They believe that the findings have potential consequences for the release of lockdown measures across the world, and suggested that individual variation is an important feature to include in models that guide policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/herd-immunity-threshold-could-be-lower-than-previously-thought-study/story-m1kzLsVFwMjgzfcX7NrvuN.html

We immediately called the Punjab Forensic Science Agency for further investigation into the incident,” Syed told Dawn.“It was purely a case of addiction as the boy used to play PUBG game for many hours a day. The boy’s father also confirmed about his obsession with the online game on which he spent many hours a day,” the police officer said. This is said to be the fourth suicide in Punjab province related to the online games.

24-06-2020||World||Advanced cancer, chemotherapy may not aggravate risk of severe Covid-19: Study||Advanced cancer, and chemotherapy treatment may not increase the risk of developing severe Covid-19, according to a study which assessed more than 400 patients hospitalised with novel coronavirus infection. The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, noted that 40 per cent of 423 patients with cancer at a New York City cancer centre diagnosed with Covid-19 were hospitalised. According to the researchers, including Mini Kamboj from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the US, 20 per cent of the patients developed severe respiratory illness and 12 per cent died within 30 days. While chemotherapy was not found to be an aggravating factor, they said patients treated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy were more likely to be hospitalised with respiratory complications from the viral infection. While earlier studies from China and Italy suggested that there is a higher Covid-19 death rate in patients with cancer, the scientists said little is known about the interplay between the two illnesses, or how active cancer treatment might exacerbate the effects of Covid-19. In the study, they analysed the clinical characteristics of 423 patients with cancer and Covid-19, of whom 212 patients were male and 211 were female. According to the study, about 56 per cent of the patients were over 60 years of age, and were more frequently diagnosed with solid tumours, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. The scientists said 59 per cent of patients also had pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, kidney or heart disease, which have also been associated with increased illness severity. Of the 20 per cent of patients with severe respiratory illness, they said 11 per cent required high-flow oxygen and 9 per cent required respirators. According to the study, the risk factors for hospitalisation included having a blood-cancer diagnosis, non-white race, corticosteroid use, and immune-checkpoint-inhibitor drug therapy. The scientists said the risk factors for severe respiratory illness were similar but not identical. They cautioned that further research in larger patient populations is needed to identify risks from Covid-19 in various cancers and with different therapies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/advanced-cancer-chemotherapy-may-not-aggravate-risk-of-severe-covid-19-study/story-GufrvAdyzGFDJncX1c4R0H.html

In response, Johnson said: “We have a very effective cluster-busting operation which is designed to ensure that we keep those outbreaks under control.” “I am not going to pretend ... that this thing is beaten or that the virus has gone away ... We have to remain vigilant and local councils will be supported in doing their vital work in implementing local lockdowns,” he added, challenging Starmer to find any other country that has a functioning tracing app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-dismisses-criticism-on-local-lockdowns-coronavirus-app/story-g1ae1k3T5mzvO88YZJNJbL.html
24-06-2020||World||‘World went mad’ imposing Covid-19 lockdowns, says Swedish epidemiologist||The man behind Sweden’s controversial Covid-19 strategy has characterized lockdowns imposed across much of the globe as a form of “madness” that flies in the face of what is known about handling viral outbreaks.Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist, said he advised against such restrictions on movement because of the detrimental side effects they often entail.“It was as if the world had gone mad, and everything we had discussed was forgotten,” Tegnell said in a podcast with Swedish Radio on Wednesday. “The cases became too many and the political pressure got too strong. And then Sweden stood there rather alone.”SWEDEN INSIGHT: Less of an Outlier -- High Frequency DashboardTegnell admits he misjudged the deadly potential of the coronavirus in its early stages, but has refused to consider abandoning his strategy. He says restricting movement to the radical extent seen across much of the globe can create other problems, including increased domestic abuse, loneliness and mass unemployment.“In the same way that all drugs have side effects, measures against a pandemic also have negative effects,” he said. “At an authority like ours, which works with a broad spectrum of public health issues, it is natural to take these aspects into account.”But Sweden now has one of the world’s highest Covid-19 mortality rates, with more deaths per 100,000 than the US, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Polls suggest Swedes have started to lose faith in their country’s response to the pandemic.Instead of shuttering schools, shops and restaurants, Sweden left pretty much everything open. Citizens were encouraged to observe social distancing guidelines, but the strategy assumed Swedes would voluntarily alter their behaviour without the need for laws.Tegnell also advised against using face masks, arguing there’s little scientific evidence they work. And he says it’s clear that closing down schools was an unnecessary response to the pandemic, a notion that’s actually supported in a recent French study.Tegnell’s underlying argument is that Covid-19 isn’t going away any time soon, meaning sudden, severe lockdowns will ultimately prove ineffective in addressing the longer-term threat. Meanwhile, the virus has recently resurfaced in a number of places where authorities thought they’d brought it under control, including Beijing.“I’m looking forward to a more serious evaluation of our work than has been made so far,” Tegnell said. “There is no way of knowing how this ends.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-went-mad-imposing-covid-19-lockdowns-says-swedish-epidemiologist/story-0QsmZAhZ4uYaC7elcYnThP.html
24-06-2020||World||Pilots on Pak plane that crashed were ‘discussing coronavirus during landing’||A plane crash which killed 97 people in Pakistan last month was because of human error by the pilots, who were discussing the coronavirus crisis during the landing, according to an initial report released Wednesday.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane crashed into a crowded residential area on May 22 after both engines failed as it approached Karachi airport, killing all but two people on board.“The pilot, as well as the (air traffic) controller, didn’t follow the standard rules,” said Ghulam Sarwar Khan, the country’s aviation minister, announcing the findings in parliament.He said the pilots had been discussing the deadly virus as they attempted to land the Airbus A320 and had disengaged the craft’s autopilot.“The pilot and co-pilot were not focused and throughout they were having a conversation about corona. The [virus] was on their minds. Their families were affected and they were having a discussion about it,” Khan added.“Unfortunately the pilot was overconfident,” the minister said.The report found the plane was flying at more than twice the altitude it should have been when it approached the runway without the landing gear down.Standard flight operating procedures were then ignored by the pilots and the air traffic controller, resulting in an aborted landing that heavily damaged the plane’s engines.The aircraft went down as it attempted a second landing, crashing into a residential area near the airport.The investigation team, which included officials from the French government and the aviation industry, analysed cockpit data and voice recorders.The full report is expected to be released at the end of the year, with advance analysis of the aircraft wreckage still ongoing.The minister said the plane was “100 percent fit for flying, there was no technical fault”.The crash damaged around 29 houses, the minister said, adding that the government would compensate residents for losses.- Chequered safety record -The county’s deadliest aviation accident in eight years came days after domestic commercial flights resumed following a two-month coronavirus lockdown.Many passengers were on their way to spend the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr with loved ones.Images from the scene showed buildings torn apart after the plane’s wings sliced through rooftops, sending flames and plumes of smoke into the air.In a rescue operation that lasted until the next day, firefighters pulled bodies from the wreckage still wearing seatbelts.Nobody on the ground was killed.Pakistan has a chequered military and civilian aviation safety record, with frequent plane and helicopter crashes over the years.In 2016, a PIA plane burst into flames after one of its two turboprop engines failed while flying from the remote north to Islamabad, killing more than 40 people.The deadliest air disaster in Pakistan was in 2010 when an Airbus A321 operated by private airline Airblue and flying from Karachi crashed into the hills of Islamabad as it came in to land, killing all 152 people on board.An official report blamed the accident on a confused captain and a hostile cockpit atmosphere.PIA, one of the world’s leading airlines until the 1970s, now suffers from a sinking reputation due to frequent cancellations, delays and financial troubles.It has been involved in numerous controversies over the years, including the jailing of a drunk pilot in Britain in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilots-on-pak-plane-that-crashed-were-discussing-coronavirus-during-landing-report/story-YFUsiVdDdDMPsmJ655501I.html

Guidance on re-opening was published sector-wise on Wednesday.In a letter to the British Medical Journal, 16 experts heading royal colleges or medical organisations or medical journals addressed leaders of political parties, reminding them that several countries are now experiencing flare-ups.They wrote: “While the future shape of the pandemic in the UK is hard to predict, the available evidence indicates that local flare-ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk. Many elements of the infrastructure needed to contain the virus are beginning to be put in place, but substantial challenges remain”.“The job now is not only to deal urgently with the wide ranging impacts of the first phase of the pandemic, but to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to contain a second phase”.Calling for an assessment of the state of UK’s preparedness to deal with the second wave, the experts wrote that it should focus on areas of weakness where action is needed urgently to prevent further loss of life and restore the economy as fully and as quickly as possible.The policy areas that need rapid attention, they wrote, include procurement of goods and services; the disproportionate burden on black, Asian, and minority ethnic individuals and communities; and international collaboration, especially to mitigate any new difficulties in pandemic management due to Brexit.The experts wrote: “We are not wedded to any particular design of inquiry or review, but as outlined in the editorial, we believe it should be quick, broad, ambitious, able to command widespread public and stakeholder trust, and needs to happen now”.“As stakeholders and leaders of the UK’s medical, nursing, and public health professions, we urge you to establish such a review. We think there’s a strong case for an immediate assessment of national preparedness, with the first results available no later than August, and that all its work should be completed by the end of October”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-second-wave-a-real-risk-say-uk-health-leaders/story-QwbvsC38iV1tfnqBgkmHkN.html
24-06-2020||World||Pilots of crashed PIA plane were not focussed, were discussing Covid: Minister||The pilots of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane that crashed last month were not focussed and they were discussing coronavirus during the flight, the country’s aviation minister told Parliament on Wednesday as he pointed out their “overconfidence and lack of concentration” as some of the reasons for the tragedy that killed 97 people on board. The domestic flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed in a residential area near the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on May 22.The Airbus A320 aircraft of the national carrier had 91 passengers and a crew of eight when it crashed into the Jinnah Garden area near Model Colony in Malir on Friday, minutes before its landing. One girl died on the ground after suffering burn injuries.Two passengers miraculously survived the crash.Federal Minister for Aviation Ghulam Sarwar Khan presented the interim investigation report on the PIA plane crash in the National Assembly, saying that the pilots were not focused and their lack of concentration had caused the crash.Human error by the pilots and air traffic control caused the crash of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane, he said.The minister said that the pilots had ignored the instructions of the air traffic control on the height of the aircraft.“The pilots and the ATC both did not follow the protocol,” he said. “The pilot ignored the instructions of the air traffic controllers and the ATC, on the other hand, did not inform the pilot about the engine colliding.“The pilots were discussing corona throughout the flight. They were not focussed. They talked about corona [...] their families were affected. When the control tower asked him to increase the plane’s height, the pilot said ‘I’ll manage’. There was overconfidence,” he said. Sarwar said that the cabin crew and ATC were also responsible for the tragedy.“Those who are responsible will be held accountable,” he said, promising that the complete investigation report will be presented in one year’s time.Sarwar said that the initial report pointed out that there was no technical fault with the aircraft and even the pilot had not said the same in his conversation with the air traffic controllers.The minister noted that the aircraft touched the runway thrice without the landing gear which caused damage to its engines.“When the plane took off again, both its engines had been damaged,” he said.Sarwar said that the conversation between the pilot and the air traffic controllers had been recorded and he had heard it himself.The minister said that the equipment from the aircraft had been extracted and decoded. He said that the recording obtained would be made part of the final report of the PIA plane crash.The minister said that 40 per cent of pilots of the national flag bearer were flying aircraft with fake licenses. He said that these pilots had not given the exams themselves nor did they have the proper flying experience, he added.“Pilots are also appointed on a political basis, unfortunately,” he said. “Whilst appointing pilots, merit is ignored,” he added, disclosing that degrees of four PIA pilots had been found out to be fake.Sarwar said that the government will take action against PIA pilots who were found guilty of the above offenses. He said that the government will ‘restructure’ the PIA and will take it back to its days of glory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilots-of-crashed-pia-plane-were-not-focussed-were-discussing-covid-report/story-oAzGeOCtvXkj8cpMhgp8rI.html
24-06-2020||World||Merkel’s popularity surge puts German Greens on the back foot||The Greens are struggling to sustain their momentum as Covid-19 upends German politics.The party led the polls in Germany last year but their rise has been arrested by the resurgence of the Christian Democrats, boosted by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s measured handling of the pandemic. With an election due next year, the Greens have slipped back below 20%, barely half the level of Merkel’s CDU-led bloc, and Co-Chairman Robert Habeck, once tied as the nation’s most popular politician, now ranks a distant seventh.That’s a blow to those hoping that the post-Merkel era might see a step change in Berlin that would place Germany at the forefront of the European Union’s push to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, the next government is more likely to mean just an incremental change from the current one.The Greens will probably still be the only party willing and able to give the Christian Democrats a majority after next year’s general election. But they are unlikely to have enough political capital to really set the agenda with neither of Merkel’s likely successors boasting particularly green credentials.“From today’s standpoint, the Greens would be the smaller partner, a majority-maker,” said Thomas Jaeger, a professor of politics at the University of Cologne.That’s a comedown from earlier this year when Berlin insiders were speculating that next year’s election could produce the first Green chancellor, or when French President Emmanuel Macron met with Habeck and co-chair Annalena Baerbock for an unprecedented three-hour chat at February’s Munich Security Conference. In January, Habeck had made his debut at the World Economic Forum in Davos.After emerging from the anti-nuclear movement and the left-wing fringe in the 1980s, the Greens served eight years with the Social Democrats before Merkel came to power in 2005, and they have made no secret of their ambitions for a return to power.The party has steadily moved toward the center -- so much so, that on its 40th anniversary in January former Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble called them a “dead ordinary” party. They’ve also established themselves as a major force in German politics. Even after their recent dip, they are still the country’s second-most popular party.“We are at about the level we were in the last European election, historically our best result nationwide,” Michael Kellner, the party’s political managing director, said in an email. “We’re not going to be driven crazy if it goes up or down a few percentage points.”‘I’m not sure’Whether the Greens can get back into position to challenge the CDU’s ascendancy before next year’s vote will depend on the economy and the climate, as well as the virus.Another harsh drought or an international climate crisis like last year’s fires could reignite support beyond young, urban professionals and the CDU itself will be something of an unknown quantity fighting its first election in a generation without Merkel as the chancellor candidate.On the other hand, a prolonged recession would mean a struggle for the Greens, who are still seen as inexperienced on the economy.“I’m not sure it’s the right party at the right time to ensure Germany’s prosperity, there’s lots of uncertainty and fear,” said Richard Martin, a former party member who runs a small IT company in the suburbs of Berlin.The party’s unbridled pro-immigration stance and apparent hunger for power don’t sit entirely well with him either. “They’ve lost authenticity,” he said.New ChallengesThe pandemic posed a whole new set of challenges to the Greens at a moment when they were starting to be taken seriously as a mainstream force.At first they backed the lockdown but then switched tack to criticize the social inequality of the measures, insisting the post-corona world needs to be a more equitable and sustainable place. On a recent TV talk show, Habeck highlighted the need for larger pig sties.The bigger problem though was that incumbents in Berlin and Brussels elbowed their way onto traditional Green territory with billions of euros for climate policy as part of their efforts to shore up the economy.But their future as a coalition partner for the post-Merkel CDU still has an air of inevitability about it in Berlin. Not least because the party’s existing partner, the SPD, is determined to go into opposition to rebuild when the current term ends. That alone means that the Greens will still have some leverage.“It’s clear that the Greens won’t have the power to advance the climate agenda they want,” Oskar Niedermayer, profesor emeritus of political science at the Free University in Berlin, said in a phone interview. “But they also have an important bargaining chip because there may be no other coalition option.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-s-popularity-surge-puts-german-greens-on-the-back-foot/story-wyyctX1z5iOPPGSSDbXgJK.html
24-06-2020||World||Two Republicans opposed by Donald Trump win in Kentucky, North Carolina||Voters rebuffed President Donald Trump and nominated two Republicans he opposed to House seats from North Carolina and Kentucky on Tuesday. Calls in higher-profile races in Kentucky and New York faced days of delay as swamped officials count mountains of mail-in ballots.In western North Carolina, GOP voters picked 24-year-old investor Madison Cawthorn, who uses a wheelchair following an accident, over Trump-backed real estate agent Lynda Bennett. The runoff was for the seat vacated by GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, who resigned to become Trump’s chief of staff and joined his new boss in backing Bennett.Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, a libertarian-minded maverick who often clashes with GOP leaders, was renominated for a sixth House term. Trump savaged Massie in March as a “disaster for America” who should be ejected from the party after he forced lawmakers to return to Washington during a pandemic to vote on a huge economic relief package.Cawthorn, who will meet the constitutionally mandated minimum age of 25 when the next Congress convenes, has said he’s a Trump supporter, and Massie is strongly conservative. Still, their victories were an embarrassment to a president whose own re-election campaign has teetered recently.As states ease voting by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic, a deluge of mail-in ballots and glacially slow counting procedures made delays inevitable. That torturous wait seemed a preview of November, when more states will embrace mail-in voting and officials warn that uncertainty over who is the next president could linger for days.Kentucky usually has 2% of its returns come from mail ballots. This year officials expect that figure to exceed 50%, and over 400,000 mail ballots were returned by Sunday.New York officials expect the vast majority of votes to be mail ballots this year, compared to their typical 5% share. Counties have until eight days after Election Day to count and release the results of mail ballots, with 1.7 million requested by voters.In the day’s marquee contests, two young African American candidates with campaigns energized by nationwide protests for racial justice were challenging white Democratic establishment favorites for the party’s nominations.First-term state legislator Charles Booker was hoping a late surge would carry him past former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath for the Democratic Senate nomination from Kentucky. And in New York, political newcomer Jamaal Bowman was seeking to derail House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel’s bid for a 17th term.In Kentucky, many counties including Jefferson, the state’s largest, faced piles of mail-in ballots and reported no results. The Associated Press doesn’t expect to call the McGrath-Booker race until June 30, when Kentucky plans to release additional tallies.Even so, Booker and supporters gathered in Louisville chanted ’’from the ‘hood to the holler,” the slogan he hoped would help build a coalition of urban Blacks and rural whites.“We have the opportunity to transform history,” Booker said.The AP was also delaying its call in New York’s Engel-Bowman race, pending additional vote tallies.In other contests, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky easily won the Republican nomination for a seventh Senate term and will be favored in November against McGrath or Booker.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., won renomination, cementing her rise from obscurity to progressive icon status when she ousted Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley, on track to become speaker, from the New York City district.In Virginia, retired Army Col. Daniel Gade won the GOP Senate nomination but seems certain to lose to Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in November. Republican Scott Taylor will face Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria in a rematch between two Navy veterans in a Virginia Beach district from which she toppled him in 2018.And Cameron Webb, a health policy researcher, won the Democratic nomination for a central Virginia House district. GOP Rep. Denver Riggleman lost his party’s nomination, fueling Democrats’ hopes that Webb, an African American, can capture the seat.Voters endured 90-minute waits in Kentucky’s second-largest city, Lexington, and social media posts showed long lines in New York’s Westchester County deep into the evening. Yet overall, the day’s problems seemed less widespread than in recent elections in Georgia and Nevada, where some people stood in line for hours.In Louisville, voting advocates complained that an unknown number of people stayed home because of difficulty traveling to the city’s single polling place — the Kentucky Exposition Center.“In my neighborhood, most people don’t have cars,” said voter Michael Baker. “It’s not fair for them to have one site.”A judge kept the polling place open an extra half hour after about 175 people, some of whom pounded on the building’s doors, demanded to vote. Louisville, the state’s biggest city, has 600,000 residents.In the big New York and Kentucky contests, Democrats were watching whether nationwide protests sparked by last month’s killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police would translate to a decisive turnout by African American and progressive voters.Kentucky’s McGrath has a military resume, centrists views and fundraising abilities that helped her win support from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to oppose McConnell.Booker’s campaign caught fire after he attended recent protests against the March police killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor in her Louisville home. That helped him win support from progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and the state’s two largest newspapers.In one measure of McGrath’s financial advantage, she has spent $16 million in ads compared to Booker’s $2 million, according to Advertising Analytics, which studies campaign advertising.In New York, Engel is supported by Democratic stars like Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Congressional Black Caucus, plus major labor unions. He’s one of Congress’ most liberal members.Bowman, an educator, has drawn strength from anti-racism protests and his accusations that Engel has grown aloof from his diverse district in parts of the Bronx and Westchester. Bowman has been helped by progressive groups and lawmakers like Sanders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-republicans-opposed-by-donald-trump-win-in-kentucky-north-carolina/story-CfgSpDzjAMdGFLzBL7d2lO.html

Chinese and Indian military commanders agreed on Monday to disengage their forces in the disputed area.Qureshi, in his comments broadcast by Geo TV, offered no evidence for his allegations and there was no immediate comment from India or China.The remarks were Qureshi’s latest verbal attack on India. On Tuesday he condemned India’s move ordering Pakistan’s diplomatic mission in New Delhi to reduce its staff by half within a week.The Indian foreign ministry said it will do the same in Islamabad after two Indian Embassy employees were seized at gunpoint in Pakistan.Earlier, Pakistani authorities had said that two people, identified as drivers for the Indian High Commission, were arrested when they hit a pedestrian and tried to flee. They said police searched the vehicle and found counterfeit currency inside.The two were released to the high commission and were transported to the border, where they crossed into India, authorities said.Qureshi alleged that India, “after being beaten and embarrassed” by China in the Himalayan incident was trying to find an excuse for an operation against Pakistan.“If 50% of our embassy staff comes back, then the Indian Embassy staff will also go back,” he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-s-shah-mahmood-qureshi-warns-india-over-downgrading-of-diplomatic-staff/story-WLB6buOzTUl7zKqEdZVheM.html

Tehran rejected the resolution and said it would deliver an “appropriate response.” Its envoy to the IAEA warned that the agency risked “destroying” the Islamic Republic’s nuclear deal with five world powers.The 2015 accord has already been severely compromised by the Trump administration’s withdrawal two years ago and imposition of bruising sanctions. On Wednesday, Rouhani said his country isn’t waiting to see the outcome of the US presidential election in November, and is “ready to negotiate the moment the White House and the US Congress decide to leave their misguided path and return to the P5+1 group” of nations that signed the agreement.He didn’t say what the substance of those negotiations would be.The IAEA resolution was the first formal rebuke of Iran since 2012.“It is easy for the Islamic Republic to give a decisive response, but the IAEA should be careful not to get derailed from its path,” Rouhani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-it-s-ready-to-work-with-atomic-watchdog-after-un-rebuke/story-eP5Uu8URoqSaAVTU0rSg9L.html
24-06-2020||World||United States Covid-19 cases surge to highest level in two months||New coronavirus cases in the US have surged to their highest level in two months and are now back to where they were at the peak of the outbreak.The US on Tuesday reported 34,700 new cases of the virus, according to a tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University that was published Wednesday. There have been only two previous days that the US has reported more cases: April 9 and April 24, when a record 36,400 cases were logged.New cases in the US have been surging for more than a week after trending down for more than six weeks. While early hot spots like New York and New Jersey have seen cases steadily decrease, the virus has been hitting the south and west. Several states on Tuesday set single-day records, including Arizona, California, Mississippi, Nevada and Texas.Also read| Global Covid-19 death toll surges past 475,000: ReportCases were also surging in other parts of the world. India reported a record daily increase of nearly 16,000 new cases. Mexico, where testing rates have been low, also set a record with more than 6,200 new cases.But China appears to have tamed a new outbreak of the virus in Beijing, once again demonstrating its ability to quickly mobilize vast resources by testing nearly 2.5 million people in 11 days.ALSO WATCH | ‘Kung Flu’: Donald Trump mocks China over Covid; White House denies racism In the US state of Arizona, which on Tuesday reported a record 3,600 new infections, hundreds of young conservatives packed a megachurch to hear President Donald Trump’s call for them to back his reelection bid.As he did at a rally in Oklahoma over the weekend, Trump referred to the virus with a pejorative term directed at its emergence in China.Ahead of the event, the Democratic mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego, made clear that she did not believe the speech could be safely held in her city — and urged the president to wear a face mask. He did not.

Plan B, if you do, make sure you wear a mask,” said Fauci, the infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health.In China, an outbreak that has infected more than 200 people in the capital this month appeared to be firmly waning. China on Wednesday reported 12 cases, down from 22 the day before. Beijing reported seven new cases, down from 13.Officials in Beijing said they tested more than 2.4 million people between June 12 and June 22. That’s more than 10% of the capital’s population of about 20 million.Authorities began testing people at food markets and in the areas around them. They expanded that to include restaurant staff and the city’s 100,000 delivery workers. China also said it used big data to find people who had been near markets for testing, without specifying how.The vast majority have tested negative, though one courier delivering groceries from supermarkets tested positive.A single inflatable mobile lab in one district was capable of conducting 30,000 tests a day, the official Xinhua News Agency said.South Korea, which successfully tamed its first wave of infections, is seeing another rise. While the first outbreak was centered in its fourth-largest city, the current outbreak is in the Seoul region, where most South Koreans live. Authorities reported 51 cases Wednesday. Its increase of 40 to 50 cases every day over the past two weeks comes amid increased public activity and eased attitudes on social distancing.In India, with a population of more than 1.3 billion, the densely populated cities of Mumbai and New Delhi have been hardest hit. The country has reported more than 450,000 cases of the virus, including more than 14,000 deaths.The situation in New Delhi is a rising concern, with the federal government criticizing its poor contact tracing and a lack of hospital beds.Mexico reported nearly 800 new deaths on Wednesday. The country has recorded more than 190,000 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, although officials acknowledge both are undercounts due to extremely low testing rates. Mexico has performed only about half a million tests, or about one for every 250 inhabitants.Worldwide, more than 9.2 million people have contracted the virus, including more than 477,000 who have died, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-covid-19-cases-surge-to-highest-level-in-two-months/story-4iSFH3ljOhhMZc20TDt2MK.html
24-06-2020||World||Syria reports Israeli raids on central, south military posts||Syrian air defences responded to Israeli attacks on military posts in a central province early on Wednesday, shortly after similar attacks in the south killed two soldiers, the defence ministry in Damascus said.State media cited a military official as saying the attack targeted posts in rural areas of Hama province. Air defenses were activated and reportedly intercepted a number of the incoming missiles.The official, who was not named, also said those attacks caused only material damage. But hours earlier, similar air raids on military posts in the south killed two soldiers and wounded four.The late Tuesday coordinated aerial attacks targeted military bases in the southern Sweida and the southeastern Deir el-Zour province. The defense ministry’s statement did not say who was behind the attacks, only that the aircraft flew over eastern Syria. It said the country’s air defense were activated.Israel rarely comments on such attacks in Syria. But in recent weeks, it has carried out several attacks on targets inside Syria, believed to be Iranian and proxy interests. In the past two months alone, Syria has accused Israel of carrying out at least eight air raids on its territory.In recent months, Israeli officials have expressed concern that Iranian-backed militant Lebanese group Hezbollah is trying to establish production facilities for precision guided missiles. Tension has also been rising along the Israel-Lebanon border.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said one of the targets attacked in Hama was a weapons depot used by an Iranian-backed militia near the town of Salamiya. That strike caused loud explosions that could be heard in the area, according to the Observatory. A private Syrian radio station Sham FM said three civilians in Hama were wounded by shrapnel from the attacks but did not specify where.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syria-reports-israeli-raids-on-central-south-military-posts/story-ifgMM7FrItylR20vlKRorN.html
24-06-2020||World||Taiwan’s Chiang Kai-shek statues draw curious crowds - and controversy||Unwanted for public spaces elsewhere in Taiwan, some 200 statues of the late autocratic leader Chiang Kai-shek stand in the quiet sanctuary of a park surrounding his mausoleum in the north of the island.Chiang Kai-shek was lauded in life as an anti-communist hero, especially in the United States, and there are still more than 1,000 Chiang statues in public places around Taiwan. But attitudes towards him on the proudly democratic island have become more conflicted.Chiang’s defeated Nationalist government fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil in 1949.During the Cold War, he was backed strongly by the United States, and some Taiwanese still view him positively for standing up to Mao Zedong’s communism.But, many others revile him as a despot who imprisoned and killed opponents during a reign of terror. When he died in 1975, his son Chiang Ching-kuo took over and began tentative steps towards more political openness.Yvon Lin, 36, a Taipei city councillor for the small New Power Party, which supports Taiwan’s formal independence, said the question of what to do with statues of the Chiangs was problematical as they were such polarising figures.“Taiwan is quite special in that around half of people really support what the two Chiangs did in the past, so if we want to get rid of the symbols of authoritarianism these people could come out and protest,” Lin told Reuters.In the past few years some statues have been daubed with paint, often around the anniversary of a 1947 anti-government uprising, generally seen as the start of Chiang’s “white terror” campaign against dissent in Taiwan.His Nationalists took control of the island from Japan in 1945 at the end of World War Two.Nowadays, at the mausoleum in Taoyuan, outside Taipei, tourists pose for pictures as they gather round the statues depicting Chiang in various roles, from kindly father figure, to wise scholar, to military commander. Just as the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired a debate in Western countries over what to do with statues of people connected with the slave trade, Taiwan has also been coming to terms with a checkered history.Under 2017’s Act on Promoting Transitional Justice, symbols of Taiwan’s authoritarian era are supposed to be removed, renamed or “handled in other ways”.

24-06-2020||World||In conflict-hit countries, coronavirus testing may not reach women||Big gaps between the number of male and female coronavirus cases in parts of Africa and the Middle East suggest that women may be struggling to access testing or care, an aid agency said on Wednesday.In Pakistan, Afghanistan and Yemen, more than 70% of reported cases were male, compared to a global average of 51%, and the same was true in Central African Republic, Chad and Somalia, said the International Rescue Committee (IRC).“What we are seeing is a situation in which women are potentially being left out of testing and their health deprioritized,” said Stacey Mearns, senior technical advisor of emergency health at the IRC.“This could have serious ramifications for their physical wellbeing.”The World Health Organization (WHO) has urged countries to report the sex and age breakdown of confirmed COVID-19 cases so it can analyze who is affected most.Fewer than half of globally confirmed cases had been reported with sex and age data, so any interpretation of gender differences should be done with caution, said the WHO in May.As of this week the disease had infected about 9 million people and killed almost half a million worldwide, according to a Reuters tally.Studies in China, Europe and the United States have shown that men are more likely than women to be hospitalized and die of coronavirus.But they have not shown the gender gap in confirmed cases that set off warning signals for the IRC. In most of Europe, the numbers of cases are roughly equal between men and women.“The numbers do not add up,” said Mearns.Testing is extremely limited in most low-income countries, and even more so in conflict zones, which is where the biggest gender gaps occurred, said the IRC.Women in conflict-hit areas often have difficulty accessing health services due to gender discrimination and inequality, the agency added.Globally, experts have warned that women may suffer the brunt of the virus’ impact because they are less likely to have health care, more likely to take on unpaid work and more likely to lose their jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-conflict-hit-countries-coronavirus-testing-may-not-reach-women/story-IkfBtPHkhaf2pEUd3t2DZN.html
24-06-2020||World||Swedish confidence levels jump as Covid-19 concern recedes||Confidence levels jumped in Sweden as consumers and businesses started to leave the worst of the Covid-19 crisis behind them.The overall economic tendency survey rose to 75.2 in June, from a revised 64.4 in May, the National Institute of Economic Research said Wednesday. Sentiment had plunged to an all-time low in April, and despite June’s jump remains depressed, as values below 90 are equivalent to a much weaker than normal economy.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“All in all, sentiment is recovering from the initial shock, but is still gloomy and perhaps somewhat more pessimistic than expected,” Nordea economist Torbjorn Isaksson said. “The export industry continues to struggle. A good sign is households’ relatively optimistic view on their own financial situation.”The reading comes as economists and policy makers revise up their forecasts in light of better-than-expected consumer spending and unemployment data.According to Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole, the rebound in confidence levels “continues to keep the risk for additional policy action low, irrespective of Riksbank members leaving all options open.”But Bloomberg economist Johanna Jeansson was less sanguine, while agreeing that “the most acute phase of the crisis has abated.”“Today’s survey is yet another sign that the most acute phase of the crisis has abated. But with both demand and supply below pre-pandemic levels, we expect the Riksbank and the Ministry of Finance will have to do more,” Johanna JeanssonUnlike its neighbors, Sweden avoided a strict lockdown as the coronavirus spread, keeping shops, schools and restaurants open. The lax strategy appears to have mitigated some of the economic damage caused by the pandemic, but at the cost of a relatively high death toll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedish-confidence-levels-jump-as-covid-19-concern-recedes/story-BAcoXVWg00pkQKIvU6gZNM.html

They were thrown overboard,” he said, later telling Reuters that those that perished had fallen sick, without elaborating further.The fate of close to 500 Rohingya who had remained on “Motherboat 1” after the transfer at sea was unknown as authorities have been unable to track the vessel’s location, he said.The Rohingya had risked the perilous sea journey having lost hope of making a better life in the refugee camps in Bangladesh, where many had found sanctuary after fleeing their homes in Myanmar following a military crackdown in 2017.Mainly Muslim Malaysia is home to the second largest number of Rohingya refugees after Bangladesh.But in recent weeks, the Southeast Asian country has turned away at least two boats and detained hundreds of Rohingya and undocumented migrants, amid heightened public anger towards foreigners who have been accused of spreading the coronavirus and burdening state resources.Mohd Zubil said the Rohingya survivors, who have since been detained, had paid traffickers about 2,500 ringgit ($585) up front for the voyage, with a pledge to pay an additional 11,000-13,000 ringgit once they found jobs in Malaysia.Most of them were women promised for marriage to Rohingya men in Malaysia, he said.Mohd Zubil declined to comment on whether a decision had been made to push the detainees back out to sea once their boat is repaired, a reported proposal that has been criticised by human rights groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rohingya-refugees-tell-malaysia-how-dozens-perished-during-four-month-voyage/story-azk02p3tcZ1AHpAZ2kY7IN.html
24-06-2020||World||Israeli annexation plan draws apartheid comparisons||Benjamin Pogrund spent decades battling apartheid as a journalist in South Africa. Since moving to Israel two decades ago, he has passionately defended the country against charges that it too is an apartheid state.But at the age of 87, Pogrund is having second thoughts. He says that if Israel moves ahead with plans to annex parts of the West Bank, he will have no choice but to declare that his adopted homeland has become a modern-day version of apartheid-era South Africa.“There will be Israeli overlords in an occupied area. And the people over whom they will be ruling will not have basic rights,” Pogrund said in an interview in his leafy backyard garden. “That will be apartheid. And we will merit the charge. And that is something that worries me gravely because it exposes us to huge dangers.”Pogrund, a prolific author who is working on a new book about South African political history, says he feels so despondent he’s been unable to write about looming annexation.“I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Quite frankly, I just feel so bleak about it, that it is so stupid and ill-advised and arrogant,” he said.For years, Israel’s harshest detractors have labeled it an apartheid state to describe its rule over Palestinians who were denied basic rights in occupied areas. For the most part, Israel has successfully pushed back against the fraught word.But as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nears launching his annexation moves as part of President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan — perhaps as early as next month — the term is increasingly becoming part of Israel’s political conversation.Mainstream politicians who oppose annexation have begun to use the term. Disillusioned former military men bounce it around. Israel’s most popular political satire show, “Wonderful Country,” recently ran a spoof ad for a fictitious drone company that lifts Palestinians and flies them away from annexed land. The drone’s name: “Apart-High.”“When you start doing these unilateral actions, you actually put yourself on a very slippery slope,” said Gadi Shamni, a retired Israeli general who once commanded the West Bank. Inevitably, Palestinians in annexed areas will demand the rights of citizens, including the right to vote, which will “eventually create some kind of apartheid,” he warned.Apartheid refers to the system of racial discrimination enforced by South Africa’s white-minority regime from 1948 until 1994. It was characterized by separate housing and public facilities for blacks and whites, bans on interracial relations and disenfranchisement of the Black majority. Branded a pariah state, South Africa peacefully dismantled apartheid in 1994, when democratic elections brought Nelson Mandela to become its first Black president.Supporters of the Israeli government are outraged at comparisons to South Africa. They note that Israel’s Arab minority, about 20% of the population, can vote and, even if there is some discrimination, have risen high in business, politics and entertainment. They say the West Bank is “disputed,” not occupied, and defend Israel’s presence in the West Bank in terms of security or the deep Jewish connection to what religious Jews call biblical Judea and Samaria.The comparison is “deeply offensive,” said Eugene Kontorovich, head of the international law department at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative think tank in Jerusalem that frequently advises Netanyahu’s government.“Apartheid was a system in which a minority white government in South Africa ruled over the Black majority,” he said. “They taxed them. They drafted them, and they passed every law under which they lived.”He said none of these conditions apply, with most Palestinians governed by the self-rule Palestinian Authority, which has limited autonomy in parts of the West Bank.Pogrund sees things differently, the result of his years of experience in South Africa.As a reporter and editor at the Rand Daily Mail in Johannesburg, Pogrund documented many of the horrors of apartheid.These included the infamous Sharpeville massacre in which South African police fired on black protesters, killing 69 people, and exposés about prison conditions and the torture of Black prison inmates. He was jailed for refusing to identify an informant, put on trial for his reporting, saw his home ransacked by police and sometimes required a bodyguard. He visited Mandela, a trusted source and friend, in prison. Last year, he received a “National Order,” one of South Africa’s most prestigious awards.Pogrund left South Africa after his newspaper was closed in 1985 under government pressure. After time in London and the United States, he moved to Israel in 1997.Pogrund is a vocal critic of Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians. He describes the West Bank occupation — in which Israeli settlers and Palestinians live under different sets of laws — with words like “tyrannical,” “oppression” and “brutality.” But he has always stopped short of calling it apartheid, believing the term is uniquely evil.“It’s a deadly word,” he said.Advocates of the term argue that it already is applicable in the West Bank because, despite the existence of the Palestinian Authority, Israel has ultimate, de facto control over the territory. It controls entry and exit, water and other resources and overall security. Under interim peace accords, it also maintains full control over 60% of the West Bank where all settlements are located and tens of thousands of Palestinians live but have no voice.As appalling as he finds the occupation, Pogrund has argued for years in articles, lectures and a 2014 book that the situation lacks the “intentionality” and “institutionalized” racism of South Africa.Where South Africa’s system was designed with the intent of creating second-class people based on their skin color, he believes Israel’s poor treatment of Palestinians are rooted in security concerns.“There’s discrimination. There’s oppression. It’s not apartheid,” he said.Pogrund said he began to have misgivings several years ago when the Israeli parliament passed its “Nation State Law,” which declared the country to be the “national home” of the Jewish people while appearing to downgrade the status of the Arab minority.“Annexation will take us right over the edge,” he said.In a recent interview, Netanyahu said Palestinians would remain in “enclaves” and “remain Palestinian subjects.” Some reports have suggested that Netanyahu may scale back the annexation to help minimize international criticism, but Pogrund says size doesn’t matter.During his time in London, he recalled a shopper picking up a package of grapes, seeing they were a product of South Africa and putting them down in disgust. He fears Israel will be in a similar position.“You’ll be carrying the apartheid stigma,” he said. “We are heading straight into self-inflicting (this) on our ourselves. We are applying apartheid, the hated word of the second half of the 20th century.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-annexation-plan-draws-apartheid-comparisons/story-EqvDdclJ9VQvl2B52BlkRM.html
24-06-2020||World||Brazil tests Covid shot, without deal to use it if it works||Brazil is testing an experimental coronavirus vaccine, but interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello acknowledged Tuesday that the government has yet to strike a deal to get it if it works. Other nations have already secured hundreds of millions of doses of the shot created by Oxford University. The country’s pandemic response has faced criticism since March, when President Jair Bolsonaro started defying social distancing recommendations. Hours before Brazil’s health minister spoke at congress, a judge ordered Bolsonaro to wear a face mask whenever he is outdoors in the capital of Brasilia. Pazuello, an army general who made his career in logistics, discussed Brazil’s efforts to buy a vaccine for the virus or acquire the technology to make it. The country’s health regulator, Anvisa, approved human clinical trials for the potential vaccine this month. Pazuello said a decision on a deal for Brazil to acquire the planned vaccine is expected by the end of the week, but will depend on the government’s chief of staff.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage British researchers started testing the experimental shot in May aiming to immunize more than 10,000 people, including older people and children. The vaccine is one of about a dozen in early stages of human testing. Brazil, where coronavirus infections are still on the rise, is the only country other than the United Kingdom testing the Oxford vaccine. The country counts more than 1 million confirmed cases and more than 52,600 fatalities. Clinical trials began in Sao Paulo on Monday and will start in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday. The British Embassy says 5,000 health professionals are being vaccinated. “We are working directly with the three most promising” vaccines, Pazuello said, naming the Oxford shot, a vaccine under development by American company Moderna and one of the Chinese experiments, which he did not disclose. Vijay Rangarajan, the British ambassador to Brazil, told The Associated Press he hopes Brazil will “be one of the first countries to receive the vaccine” if it works. “However, that will depend on when the country will sign the agreement,” he said by e-mail. “There is already production capacity for the vaccine of 2 billion doses worldwide. But much of the global production is already purchased.” On May 21, the United States announced a deal for at least 300 million doses of the Oxford shot, and committed up to USD 1.2 billion to the effort. On June 13, pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca agreed to supply up to 400 million doses of the experimental vaccine to European Union nations. Other negotiations are ongoing with Russia and Japan, among other countries, the company’s CEO said this month. The British ambassador also added he wants “to ensure Brazilians can benefit from any vaccine, quickly and not for profit.” Bolsonaro has been criticized for downplaying his government’s response to the pandemic, comparing the disease to “a little flu.” Prior to vaccine trials, Bolsonaro repeatedly touted the use of chloroquine to treat Covid-19, the disease that can be caused by the coronavirus, even as health experts dismissed its efficacy. The U.S. announced May 31 that it would donate 2 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, a similar anti-malarial that is considered less toxic, to the South American nation. The U.S. also pledged to donate 1,000 ventilators to Brazil. The first 200 ventilators are expected arrive by the end of this week, U.S. Ambassador Todd Chapman told reporters Tuesday in a video call. Another experimental vaccine in development by Chinese company Sinovac Biotech will be tested in Brazil in July, according to the Sao Paulo state government. Sinovac has a deal with the state’s Instituto Butantan to produce it. Some 9,000 Brazilians are expected to participate. Earlier Tuesday, a Brazilian federal judge ordered Bolsonaro to comply with local rules to wear a face mask or be fined. In recent weekends, a sometimes unmasked Bolsonaro has joined throngs of people protesting against Brazil’s Congress and Supreme Court and he has visited bakeries and outdoor food stalls, drawing crowds around him. Since the end of April, Brazil’s federal district has required people to wear face masks in public to help control the spread of the new coronavirus. Failure to comply carries a possible daily fine of USD 390. Judge Renato Coelho Borelli said in his ruling that Bolsonaro “has exposed other people to the contagion of a disease that has caused national commotion.” The Brazilian president did not immediately comment on the decision. An earlier court ruling required him to publish the results of three Covid-19 tests he took early March, and all were negative for the virus. He has not disclosed any tests since then. Bolsonaro sometimes appears in public events with a mask, unlike some other heads of state, including U.S. President Donald Trump, Mexico’s Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Argentina’s Alberto Fernandez, who has often hugged supporters and taken selfies with them while not wearing a mask, although use of a mask is mandatory in Argentina’s capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-tests-covid-shot-without-deal-to-use-it-if-it-works/story-5W3HtkgawRO2K8UeqrmENK.html
24-06-2020||World||Indian restaurant vandalised in New Mexico||An Indian restaurant owned by a Sikh in the Sante Fe city in the US state of New Mexico was broken into and vandalised with hate messages scrawled on its walls, according to a media report.The damage caused to India Palace restaurant is estimated to be worth USD 100,000, local Santa Fe Reporter newspaper reported on Tuesday. The vandalisation is being investigated by local police and the FBI, it said.The Sikh American Legal Defence and Education Fund (SALDEF), a non-profit civil rights organisation, has condemned the incident. “This kind of hate and violence is unacceptable and swift action must be taken to ensure the safety and security of all Americans,” said SALDEF executive director Kiran Kaur Gill. According to the local daily, tables were overturned, glassware was smashed into piles on the floor, wine racks were emptied, a statue of a goddess was beheaded and computers were stolen. The vandals also turned over and destroyed food warmers, while the front desk area was gutted, plates smashed and the kitchen rendered completely unusable, it said. “I walked into the kitchen, I saw everything and I was like, hold on, what? What is going on here?” owner Baljit Singh told Santa Fe Reporter. “White power,” “Trump 2020,” “go home,” and far worse were spray-painted on walls, doors, counters and any other available surface. “Some phrases contained threats of violence and derogatory racial slurs,” the daily said. “Santa Fe is a peaceful town, and the Sikh community has lived here, beautifully integrated, since the 60s,” said SALDEF board member Simran Singh, who lives minutes away from the restaurant. “Tensions have flared recently with the reinvigoration of the Black Lives Matter movement and the removal of statues associated with Spanish colonisers of this area, who committed a number of atrocities,” he said. “Nevertheless, we are seeing an outpouring of love and support around the city and in my experience, our neighbours love and appreciate us, as we love and appreciate them,” he added. SALDEF said that it has seen an unprecedented rise in hate crimes including the April 29 incident wherein a Sikh American Lakhwant Singh was brutally attacked by a man identified as Eric Breeman in Lakewood, Colorado. Lakhwant Singh was told to “go back to your country,” while being attacked. No formal hate crime charges have been brought against the attacker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-restaurant-vandalised-in-new-mexico/story-ZaZjRYNpBOpPHF4jAKjVBP.html

The new virus casualty is an 80-year-old man in Victoria state. Australia has recorded 30 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours -- 20 cases in Victoria and 10 in New South Wales.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage No new coronavirus infection has been recorded in Queensland for the seventh straight day. Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said, “Seven (cases) are linked to known outbreaks. One has been detected in hotel quarantine. Nine through routine testing and three other cases are under investigation.” The official said there was a risk of more cases being hospitalised. He said there were 141 active cases in the state with over 1,000 close contacts needing to be traced. “It certainly means we’re not getting an increase or an exponential increase in community transmission cases day by day,” Sutton said. Health Minister Greg Hunt has said Australia is “as well prepared as any nation in the world” to stop the spread of coronavirus, but warned Melbourne residents to be diligent in following health norms. Earlier, Victoria Health Minister Jenny Mikakos indicated the state’s effective reproduction number (Reff), which calculates the rate of virus transmission per person, had rose to about 2.5 in the past week from below 1. Sutton said authorities wanted to keep Victoria’s effective reproduction number below one. “When it’s at two it means the active cases we have are doubling with each generation,” he said. “We have seen the community transmission figures go from single figures [of cases] to above ten. So it’s no surprise the Reff is at two or above. “But with the stabilisation in numbers in the last two days I expect that that will go back down and I absolutely hope that we can get it below one and drive those numbers back down to zero,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-reports-first-coronavirus-death-in-more-than-a-month-total-cases-cross-7-500/story-jZ8kMcTzfNKcPajuECxfuN.html
24-06-2020||World||Trump’s brother sues over niece’s book about ‘toxic’ family||President Donald Trump’s brother sued to block publication of a book by their niece Mary Trump, saying portions of the memoir violate confidentiality provisions of a settlement reached among family members almost two decades ago in a fight over money.Robert S. Trump filed the complaint Tuesday in state court in Queens, New York, seeking an order permanently barring publication on the grounds that the book will include extensive private information. The memoir purports to have an “insider’s perspective” of “countless holiday meals” as well as family events and other potentially damaging information, according to a copy of the lawsuit.The suit was filed three days after a federal judge rejected the Trump administration’s request for a court order blocking publication of a damning memoir about the president by former national security adviser John Bolton. The judge in that case said Bolton had put the nation’s security at risk by publishing classified information but that too many advance copies had been sent out to justify an emergency order blocking publication.Mary Trump’s book, “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man,” which is due to be published on July 28, could also be damaging and will include purported psychological observations about her “toxic” family, according to the lawsuit. It’s also expected to reveal her role as a primary source for the New York Times’s investigation into the president’s taxes, and to detail her claim that the family’s mistreatment of her father, Fred Trump Jr., contributed to his early death.“I am deeply disappointed in my niece Mary’s decision to write a book concerning our family,” Robert Trump said in a statement. “Her attempt to sensationalize and mischaracterize our family relationship after all of these years for her own financial gain is both a travesty and injustice to the memory of my late brother Fred and our beloved parents.“I and the rest of my entire family are so proud of my wonderful brother, the president, and feel that Mary’s actions are truly a disgrace,” Robert Trump said.Robert Trump claims that details in the book are barred from publication by the 2001 global settlement over family disputes stemming from the wills of the president’s parents, Fred and Mary, who died in 1999 and 2000. His niece agreed as part of the deal not to “directly or indirectly publish or cause to be published any diary, memoir, letter, story, photograph, interview, article, essay, account or description or depiction of any kind whatsoever” about their relationships, according to the complaint.Mary Trump received “adequate consideration” for joining the settlement, the suit claims, though financial details weren’t disclosed in the filing. Dozens of pages of heavily redacted court documents from the litigation resolved by the settlement were also included in the filing.The book’s publisher, Simon & Schuster, which provided a copy of the lawsuit, was also named in the complaint.“As the plaintiff and his attorney well know, the courts take a dim view of prior restraint, and this attempt to block publication will meet the same fate as those that have gone before,” the publisher said in a statement. “Mary Trump has written a compelling personal story of worldwide significance, and we look forward to helping her tell her story.”Mary Trump’s lawyer, Theodore Boutrous Jr., called the lawsuit a “brazen effort to squelch speech” in violation of the First Amendment.“President Trump and his siblings are seeking to suppress a book that will discuss matters of utmost public importance,” Boutrous said in a statement. “They are pursuing this unlawful prior restraint because they do not want the American people to know the truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-brother-sues-over-niece-s-book-about-toxic-family/story-MkQMkGnQvsH0XKRpu2SfDP.html
24-06-2020||World||Chinese Covid-19 vaccines cleared for final testing in UAE||A Chinese state-owned vaccine developer secured regulatory approval to test its coronavirus shots in the United Arab Emirates, making it one of the first among a slew of global efforts to get the greenlight for the final stage of human trials.Beijing-based China National Biotec Group Co. was awarded approval on Tuesday to conduct Phase III trials for its Covid-19 vaccines in the Middle Eastern country, the company said in a statement posted on its official WeChat account.CNBG said it will partner with Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and cloud computing firm G42 to carry out the trial and local production of the vaccine. It didn’t disclose details such as the timing or the number of people it plans to enroll for testing.The world’s fast-developing vaccine programs are moving into the final stage of testing before they are approved for innoculation for the general public. Pharmaceutical companies across the globe are racing to be first to find an effective shot against the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 9.2 million people and killed over 476,000.CNBG is the first Chinese vaccine developer to proceed toward a Phase III trial to test whether the two shots it developed are effective against the pathogen.Chinese companies have had to look for places with active virus outbreaks to complete the final stage of human testing, which requires thousands of people. The low number of cases in China has made it unfeasible for them to conduct such trials at home. The UAE is still adding hundreds of cases a day, with a total of more than 45,000 infections.Chinese biotech CanSino Biologics Inc. was approved last month to conduct human testing for the vaccine it co-developed with the Chinese military in Canada, but will need to re-do early safety studies before going into the Phase III trial. Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech Ltd. has partnered with Instituto Butantan to roll out testing of its shot on 9,000 people in the hot spot of Brazil, but has not yet won approval to proceed.Vaccine candidates from companies outside of China are also headed for Phase III trials. A shot co-developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc will be tested among 2,000 people in Brazil starting as early as this month. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc. is set to begin testing its shot next month in a 30,000-person trial in the US. The two shots developed by CNBG have already been tested among some 2,000 people in phase I and II trials conducted in China. One of the vaccines has been found to be generally safe, while data from the other one will be revealed on June 28. The shots were already administered on more than 1,000 employees, including senior executives of CNBG and its parent company.Employees of Chinese state-run companies are said to have also been offered voluntary shots of the CNBG vaccines if they are traveling for work overseas or if they live in high-risk areas in Beijing, which has recently seen a fresh virus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-covid-19-vaccines-cleared-for-final-testing-in-uae/story-uvpQbcG3c6VY0TqHMAWDfO.html
24-06-2020||World||UN chief hopes Israel decides against West Bank annexation||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed hope Tuesday that Israel will hear global calls and will not go ahead with annexation of parts of the West Bank, which would undermine a two-state solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The UN chief said in an interview with The Associated Press that the United Nations has been consistently conveying the message “that annexation would be not only against international law but it would be a major factor to destabilize the region.”He spoke ahead of a high-level UN Security Council meeting Wednesday morning on the Mideast where Israel’s plans to annex around 30% of the West Bank in line with President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan is certain to be a major topic.Guterres will speak before briefings from Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit and UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Nickolay Mladenov. France, which holds the council presidency this month, said half a dozen foreign ministers are expected to take part, along with the Palestinian foreign minister and Israel’s UN ambassador.Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and has built dozens of settlements that are now home to nearly 500,000 Israelis, but it never formally claimed it as an Israeli territory due to stiff international opposition.The Palestinians, with wide international backing, seek the territory as the heartland of their future independent state. Most of the international community considers Israel’s West Bank settlements illegal under international law.The Trump administration has taken a much softer line toward Israeli settlements than its predecessors. With Trump’s reelection prospects uncertain this November, Israeli hard-liners have urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to move ahead with annexation quickly. The Israeli leader’s new coalition deal includes an official clause allowing him to present his annexation plan to the government starting July 1.Such a unilateral move would all but dash Palestinian hopes of establishing a viable independent state and is vehemently opposed by the Palestinians, Arab nations and most of the rest of the world.Guterres said annexation “would undermine what I believe is necessary, which is a two-state solution in which Israelis and the Palestinians can live together in peace, respect each other, and guarantee each other’s security.”“I hope that this voice of reason that is not only mine, it is echoing across the world, will be heard by the Israeli authorities and that annexation does not take place on July 1,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-hopes-israel-decides-against-west-bank-annexation/story-4qmNrP2mkieZMOaQ6VhSbJ.html

The White House made clear on Monday that no such request was made.Fauci also said on Tuesday the US was currently seeing a disturbing surge of infections in a number of states like Texas, Florida and Arizona. He said one reason infections were rising in those states was an increase in community spread.“Right now the next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surges we are seeing in Florida, Texas, Arizona, and other states,” he said. Click here for Covid-19 live coverageUS health officials last week warned that states seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases may need to reimpose strict restrictions similar to what was implemented in March.Giroir said the country would be able to produce 180 million N95 respirators per month by fall.N95 masks are essential for protecting healthcare professionals from the coronavirus and are in short supply in many places, leading the Trump administration to invoke the Defense Production Act to boost supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-hasn-t-asked-us-to-slow-testing-us-covid-19-task-force-members/story-brLK6kuThEt4i6bXWo95FM.html

They include a measure that would allow Putin to seek two more six-year terms once the current one, his fourth, ends in 2024.Putin, 67, has said the changes already endorsed by Russia’s parliament and Constitutional Court will only take effect if a majority of people support them in the referendum. While there’s little doubt the Kremlin will secure approval for the measures, officials are eager to ensure a high turnout for the vote.Putin had attached particular importance to this year’s anniversary, inviting leaders of Western wartime allies to join him in Moscow even as they continue to sanction Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron accepted Putin’s invitation to attend on May 9 before the pandemic upended Russia’s plans.While Putin has said Russia passed the peak of the epidemic, the country is still reporting more than 7,000 new daily infections, including about 1,000 in Moscow. About 30 Russian cities have either suspended plans to stage local WWII parades or banned spectators, citing risks to public health.Only about 10 foreign leaders are expected to join Putin for the parade, mostly from ex-Soviet states as well as the heads of the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is attending. Croatian President Zoran Milanovic canceled plans to come at the last minute, saying the presidential plane had broken down.The leaders of China, France, Israel, Japan and the Czech Republic were among those who declined to come. Russia didn’t invite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy amid the continued dispute over Crimea and the war involving Kremlin-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.While Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has advised the capital’s residents to stay home to watch the parade, he hasn’t banned spectators from the streets. Large-scale rehearsals by Russia’s military have been taking place.On the stands in Red Square, invited guests are being seated apart from each other to reduce any infection risks, health officials have said. Nearly 80 veterans who were selected to sit with Putin at the parade were isolated in a resort outside Moscow for 14 days to protect the Russian leader from possible exposure to the deadly pathogen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-stages-military-show-of-strength-with-key-vote-approaching/story-wADrc2axxGSAGclXSrsDuJ.html
24-06-2020||World||Seattle police investigate new shooting near autonomous zone||Seattle police on Tuesday said they were investigating a third shooting in the Capitol Hill neighborhood near the city’s “autonomous zone,” a day after the mayor vowed to dismantle the encampment set up by anti-racism protesters. Police tweeted the shooting took place on the edge of the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP), or Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, where demonstrators set up a police-free zone in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody.A man was taken to Harborview Medical Center at 5 a.m. after being shot near Cal Anderson Park and was in satisfactory condition, hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg said. Police did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.There have been no reports indicating that the shooting on the edge of Cal Anderson Park was related to the occupation zone.The incident was the third shooting in the area in around 72 hours, police said. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, facing local and national pressure to crack down on the protests, said on Monday officials would move to wind down the blocks-long, autonomous zone set up two weeks ago. Protesters took over several blocks around the Seattle Police Department’s East Precinct building, which police vacated. She did not give a deadline but said officers would soon move back to the precinct.President Donald Trump on Saturday said the occupation was an example of what “radical left Democrats” allowed in the United States and offered to help end the “anarchist” protest “in an hour or less.”On Tuesday, he tweeted that there would never be an “autonomous zone” in Washington D.C. and any attempt to establish one “will be met with serious force!” Twitter Inc on Tuesday placed a warning notice on the tweet because it violated its policy against abusive behavior.Protests and demonstrations against police brutality have spread around the world since George Floyd, a Black man, died after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him in Minneapolis on May 25.Protesters have also demanded authorities take down monuments honoring pro-slavery Confederate figures and the architects of Europe’s colonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seattle-police-investigate-new-shooting-near-autonomous-zone/story-3dfJjPJLjyAzE2e6AtLH7H.html
24-06-2020||World||Louisville police officer fired over fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor||One of three officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed in a hail of gunfire when drug investigators burst into her home in Louisville, Kentucky, three months ago was dismissed from the police department on Tuesday.Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was killed on March 13 after the officers entered her apartment bearing a “no-knock” arrest warrant. In a termination notice issued after an administrative hearing, Louisville police chief Robert Schroeder wrote that detective Brett Hankison “displayed an extreme indifference to the value of human life” when he “wantonly and blindly fired” 10 rounds into Taylor’s home.Schroeder said the gunshots were fired through a patio door and window covered with material obscuring Hankison’s line of sight, preventing him from knowing whether anyone was inside the apartment, let alone whether they posed a threat. Some of the rounds he fired flew into the unit next door, the chief wrote.Two other officers involved in the raid remain on administrative reassignment. No criminal charges have been filed against any of the three.The notice also said Hankison, who joined the department in 2003, was disciplined in 2019 for reckless conduct that injured an innocent person. Taylor’s slaying, which returned to prominence following the May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, has become a rallying cry in nationwide protests against police brutality and racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.In the immediate aftermath of the Taylor killing, police said the officers had knocked on the door before forcing entry and were shot at by Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. One officer was struck in the leg, and all three returned fire, hitting Taylor at least eight times, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal.Walker was charged with attempted murder and assault, but prosecutors later dropped the charges, the Courier-Journal reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/louisville-police-officer-fired-over-fatal-shooting-of-breonna-taylor/story-w22P0yXdURcDMshfhbJMOP.html

24-06-2020||World||Kim Jong Un suspends planned military moves against South Korea||Kim Jong Un ordered the suspension of military actions against South Korea, a move that could ease tensions after North Korea blew up a liaison office built by Seoul and warned of further provocations.Kim “took stock of the prevailing situation and suspended the military action plans against the south” during a military commission meeting for his ruling Worker’s Party of Korea, the official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday, without elaborating. The report was published the day before the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War in 1950, a milestone that had prompted speculation about further escalation by Pyongyang.Meanwhile, South Korea detected signs that North Korea was removing about 10 loudspeakers intended for propaganda broadcasts along border, the Yonhap News Agency reported, citing unidentified government officials. The speakers were only recently reinstalled amid tensions between the two sides.Kim’s regime last week threatened to send troops back into disarmed areas near the border with South Korea and bring back operations at 10 front-line guard posts that were shut down as part of an agreement with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The liaison office in the North Korean border city of Kaesong was the most concrete achievement from a series of summits between the two Korean leaders in 2018 before it was “tragically ruined with a terrific explosion,” as KCNA announced.“It’s loosening the choke hold just enough for the South to breathe a short sigh of relief,” said Soo Kim, a Rand Corp. policy analyst. “But I would not read this as North Korea’s about-face from its continued trajectory of pressuring the South.”While Kim left the door open for more provocations by suspending, and not canceling, military action, his regime has climbed down from similar warnings before. In December, a top cadre warned the Trump administration of a “Christmas present” after demanding concessions in nuclear talks, but North Korea didn’t deliver on that threat. In 2017, North Korea warned of a strike against the US territory of Guam that never materialized.This month, North Korea ordered its troops into Kaesong, which is also home to a deserted inter-Korean industrial complex -- as well as the Mount Kumgang tourist area, another symbolic joint project that involved both nations. In recent days, it has looked to send millions of leaflets into its neighbor denouncing Moon’s government, in retaliation against similar messages lofted north of the border by North Korean defectors.The anti-Kim leaflets prompted the leader’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, to issue an unusual statement saying that it was “high time” to break ties with South Korea and North Korea subsequently blew up the $15 million liaison office. Moon -- a long-time proponent of peace -- criticized the action, while reaffirming his support for restoring economic ties with his country’s rival.Moon has found himself squeezed between North Korea’s demands to ease up on sanctions squeezing its paltry economy with more hawkish views in the Trump administration backing a maximum pressure campaign to force Kim to give up his nuclear weapons. A North Korea official dismissed the deals signed between Moon and Kim Jong Un as “scrap paper,” describing the South Korean president as the “chief culprit” for their failure.Although Kim Jong Un has not been nearly as critical as his younger sister, he has shown increasing frustration with President Donald Trump. The US president has refused to relax sanctions after three face-to-face meetings with Kim failed to produced what they US side viewed as an acceptable plan to scale back North Korea’s nuclear program.The Kim regime has a big incentive to keep tensions from getting out of control and prompting more international sanctions. North Korea’s economy faces fresh hardships because of borders being shut because of the coronavirus pandemic.“North Korea made a provocation out of pyrotechnics, something that literally made a big bang and heightened the perception of tensions, but didn’t push things so far that Pyongyang couldn’t later gain leverage in the process of de-escalating and negotiating a resolution,” said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who specialized in Korean Peninsula issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-suspends-planned-military-moves-against-south-korea/story-w6UVAShw4EbSARvTfkRlhL.html
24-06-2020||World||North Korea suspends military action plans against South Korea||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has presided over a meeting of the ruling party’s Central Military Commission and decided to suspend military action plans against South Korea, the official KCNA news agency reported on Wednesday.The video conference meeting on Tuesday also discussed documents outlining measures for “further bolstering the war deterrent of the country,” KCNA reported.The committee members “took stock of the prevailing situation” before deciding to suspend the military plans, the report said, without elaborating.Political tensions between the rival Koreas have been rising over Pyongyang’s objections to plans by defector-led groups in the South to fly propaganda leaflets over to the North.North Korea claims the moves violate an agreement between the two aimed at preventing military confrontation, and accused the defectors of insulting the dignity of North Korea’s supreme leadership.In recent weeks the North blew up a joint liaison office on its side of the border, declared an end to dialogue with the South, and threatened military action.Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, warned last week of retaliatory measures against South Korea that could involve the military, without elaborating.The General Staff of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) later said it had been studying an “action plan” that included sending troops into joint tourism and economic zones, reoccupying border guard posts that had been abandoned under an inter-Korean pact, taking steps to “turn the front line into a fortress,” and supporting plans for the North to send its own propaganda leaflets into the South.North Korea’s military was seen putting up loudspeakers near the demilitarised zone (DMZ), a military source told Reuters on Tuesday. Such systems were taken down after the two Koreas signed an accord in 2018 to cease “all hostile acts.”A report by the North Korea-monitoring website 38 North on Tuesday said that anti-South Korea rhetoric from the North over the past week had left room for flexibility.However, “even if North Korea avoids a serious escalation of tensions, it is still unlikely to pursue further diplomacy with (South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s) administration anytime in the near future,” the report said. It predicted that Pyongyang could soon turn to more heated criticism of the United States.It was unclear if the fact that the meeting was conducted by video was aimed at ensuring social distancing.North Korea has taken stringent steps to prevent an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, and has said it has zero confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-suspends-military-action-plans-against-south-korea/story-B6LTQT9wU7iHHy38NoVarK.html

Greg Abbott stressed that the public “comprehend the magnitude of the challenge” ahead and, in a first since Texas lifted lockdown orders in May, empowered cities and counties to immediately put tighter restrictions on large gatherings.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe move reflected a more urgent tone Abbott is now taking after previously asserting that Texas’ rising numbers raised concerns, but not alarms. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told lawmakers in Washington on Tuesday that “the next couple weeks are going to be critical” in Texas and other states that are trying to curtail an alarming spike in new cases.It was only last weekend that Texas surpassed 4,000 cases in a single day for the first time. On Tuesday, the record shot up to more than 5,400 new cases, and although Texas is testing more people, the rate of people testing positive inched closer to 10 percent — the highest it has been since mid-April, when Texas was still under stay-at-home orders.Abbott says shutting down the economy again is a last resort. He is now emphasizing face coverings more strenuously than at any point during the pandemic but continues to resist calls from cities, business groups and teachers to make masks mandatory.“There remain a lot of people in the state of Texas who think that the spread of Covid-19 is not a challenge,” Abbott told Bryan television station KBTX. “The coronavirus is serious. It’s spreading.”Infection rates in Texas has doubled since late May, and on Tuesday, the state reached an 12th consecutive day of record Covid-19 hospitalizations with more than 4,000. That amounts to a more than 170 percent increase in hospitalizations since Memorial Day, although Abbott and the Texas Hospital Association have stressed there remains ample capacity for now.However, some of the state’s largest medical centers are beginning to carve out more space.Texas Children’s Hospital, the largest pediatric hospital in the United States, said Tuesday it was admitting adult patients across its campuses to free up more hospital bed space in the Houston area. The number of Covid-19-positive hospital patients in Harris County, which encompasses Houston, has nearly tripled since May 31.Houston this week joined other big cities in Texas that took advantage of Abbott allowing them to force businesses to impose face mask policies for customers. Early on during the pandemic, Abbott took away the ability of cities and counties to set their own Covid-19 restrictions, but on Tuesday he ceded some power back and allowed them to impose restrictions of outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people.The move comes ahead of the July 4th holiday, when public health officials have expressed new worries about large crowds.Despite the surge, Abbott and state education officials have said it will be safe to reopen public schools in August. Local officials will decide safety measures such as masks, but the Texas State Teachers Association on Tuesday demanded a statewide order requiring masks for students and staff when class resumes for the fall semester.“The governor can preach the benefits of wearing a mask all he wants, but as long as he continues to dodge responsibility for issuing a mask order, some school officials won’t require them, and health risks for students and school employees will rise,” said Noel Candelaria, the association’s president.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the highly contagious virus can cause severe illness, including pneumonia, and be fatal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-hits-5-000-new-covid-19-cases-for-first-time-as-virus-surges/story-zZ4C1rg74NF9KSAbimIRPK.html

It was also the worst episode of aviation-related terrorism till 9/11.Among those who commemorated the day was Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In a message, he said, “Thirty-five years ago today, an explosion on Air India Flight 182, bound for the United Kingdom from Canada, killed the 329 innocent people on board, including 280 Canadians. The attack was an act of unspeakable malice and remains the deadliest terrorist attack in Canadian history. It was a shock to our country, and a threat to our collective sense of security.”June 23 is recognised as the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism in Canada.Trudeau’s message was among those posted on a special YouTube channel created by family members to honour their departed kin. Very few were able to visit any of the four memorials to the tragedy in Canada - in Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa and Montreal. But many family members posted their memorial messages on the channel which became the venue for a virtual gathering for the mourners.“It’s difficult for us as no large gathering are allowed,” Bal Gupta, chair of the Air India 182 Victims Families Association, said. “But we have to obey the rules,” he added. The memorials, particularly the one at Humber Bay in Toronto, often attract over a 100 visitors on the anniversary. As that was not possible this year, the Association informed its members they could mark the day by posting video messages.Many family members did visit the memorials, though none did so as part of a group because of the restrictions.India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria paid his respects at the memorial in Canada’s capital, and sent a message to the family members that this “was a Canadian tragedy, an Indian tragedy, a global tragedy.” His Irish counterpart Jim Kelly was another visitor. Debris from the bombed aircraft had washed up along the shores of Ireland and it also hosts a memorial to the victims.Brenda Lucki, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner, also sent a message to the family members in which she stressed the investigation into the act of terrorism is still on, saying the law enforcement agency “continues its effort to seek justice, to this day”.Others who paid their respects were the Premiers of Ontario and British Columbia, Doug Ford and John Horgan, the Mayors of Toronto and Ottawa, and India’s Consul General in Toronto Apoorva Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-35th-anniversary-of-kanishka-bombing-marked-with-virtual-vigil-in-canada/story-9Up5NUJCi8hcZgUpHTll3J.html

Whatever you’ve done so far is not enough.”The virtual fundraiser collected $7.6 million from 175,000 grassroots contributors. Obama and Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, also hosted a private online portion for high-dollar donors, which was not open to reporters and brought in more than $3.4 million.The haul was the most for any Biden campaign event, coming on the heels of the Democratic Party and Biden’s campaign outraising Republican President Donald Trump in May for the first time.Tuesday’s fundraiser showed the drawing power of Obama, who remains overwhelmingly popular among the Democratic base and who will be counted on as a key campaign figure this autumn.It also highlighted the dramatic changes the coronavirus pandemic has wrought on traditional campaigning, with the two politicians sharing a split screen from their living rooms, while supporters tuned in via livestream.Early in the 2020 campaign, Biden’s weak fundraising numbers compared with some of his Democratic competitors were a source of concern. But his fundraising from donors has picked up in recent weeks as his lead in national opinion polls grew and the country reacted to incidents of police brutality.Trump, who has been campaigning for a second term since 2017, still has far more cash on hand ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.His campaign noted in a statement that it raised more than $10 million last weekend, when the president appeared in Oklahoma for his first live campaign rally since the outbreak erupted.“There is no enthusiasm for Joe Biden,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman.‘MEAN-SPIRITED’Obama, who has only occasionally criticized Trump since leaving office in 2017, faulted his successor’s behavior several times on Tuesday, saying he “exploits” divisions among Americans and calling his approach to governing “mean-spirited.”“There is no disconnect between the urgency of this election and the political moment and what has been happening on the streets,” said Obama, referring to the civil rights protests that have swept across major cities since George Floyd, a Black man, died last month after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes.Obama also criticized Trump for ignoring advice from public health experts on how to handle the coronavirus and for giving cover to authoritarian governments by attacking the free press and advocating military force against protesters.“There’s a big contest, not just in this country but around the world, about who we are,” Obama said.Biden, who has an extensive foreign policy record both as a US senator and as vice president, said he would pick up the phone on his first day in office with a simple message to allies around the world: “America is back.”As the event ended, Obama said: “Love you, Joe.”“Love you too, pal,” Biden responded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/obama-helps-raise-11-million-in-first-campaign-event-for-biden-s-white-house-bid/story-B06CfdHMyHeO7ZsSgGkdZM.html

Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in an interview with The Associated Press that what needs to be done is to make countries understand that by acting in isolation “they are creating the situation that is getting out of control” — and that global coordination is key. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageCovid-19 started in China, moved to Europe, then to North America and now to South America, Africa and India, he said, and some people are now talking about second waves coming at any moment. Yet, he said, “there is total lack of coordination among countries in the response to the Covid.” Guterres said it’s important to use that fact “to make countries understand that bringing them together, putting together their capacities, not only in fighting the pandemic in a coordinated way but in working together to have the treatments, testing mechanisms, the vaccines … accessible to everybody, that this is the way we defeat the pandemic.” The secretary-general said coordinating political, economic and social responses to the fallout from Covid-19 including job losses, increasing violence and human rights being violated will also help mitigate the impact of the pandemic. From the start of the pandemic, Guterres has been trying to mobilize international action to address what he says is the biggest international challenge since World War II. He called for a global cease-fire to all conflicts on March 23 to tackle Covid-19 but the response has been very limited. And his calls, and repeated calls by the World Health Organization chief, for international “solidarity” to fight against Covid-19 have not led to significant changes in nationalist approaches to dealing with the virus.  “I am frustrated, of course, with the lack of international cooperation at the present moment,” Guterres said, “but I hope that the new generations will be able to make things change in the future.”  The secretary-general didn’t single out any countries, but US President Donald Trump halted all funding to the World Health Organization, accusing the UN agency leading the fight against the pandemic of failing to respond to the coronavirus because China has “total control” over it. Trump has pushed for the US economy to reopen as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in many American states. About 2.3 million Americans have been infected by the virus and some 120,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The pandemic is also still on the rise in Brazil, where there are more than 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and almost 52,000 fatalities. The country’s response has faced criticism since March when President Jair Bolsonaro started defying social distancing recommendations. Britain has the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe, at over 42,000, and the Conservative government has been sharply criticised for what many see as its slow, muddled response to fighting the pandemic.  “I think we need to promote humility,” Guterres said, “because it’s only based on humility that we’ll understand our opportunity, and understanding our opportunity we understand the need to have solidarity and unity.” The secretary-general said he sees “an enormous movement of solidarity” in societies and communities, and more voices saying, for example, that a vaccine must be “a people’s vaccine, not a vaccine in a commercial dispute among countries to make the rich benefit from it and the poor not.” “So, when I listen to the voices of the youth, when I listen to the voices of civil society, I see there the seeds that hopefully will quantify in a much better coordination in the future around response to pandemics like this one,” Guterres said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-criticises-lack-of-global-cooperation-on-covid-19/story-P9jyBZPQqeIdyDEOVjAIpO.html
24-06-2020||World||Boris Johnson gambles on lifting lockdown to save UK’s economy||Boris Johnson has launched the biggest gamble of his premiership, announcing that July will see a dramatic lifting of the lockdown measures imposed in England in March. The goal is to save the economy. The risk is that it causes a second spike in coronavirus infections.At a news conference on Tuesday evening -- the final such daily event, Johnson said, in a signal that he wants Britons to stop feeling that they’re living through a crisis -- the prime minister was clear that he took full responsibility for the decision. The scientists flanking him were were clear about the dangers, and warned that the virus will be with the U.K. into 2021.The problem faced by Johnson is balancing the potential harm of increased virus spread with the damage being done to Britain’s economy every day of the lockdown. Earlier Tuesday, government figures showed that the two main work-support programs had so far cost more than 30 billion pounds ($38 billion). Ministers worry about how many of the 9.2 million jobs being supported will disappear once the programs end.Johnson’s message to the public was clear: Get out of your homes and get spending. “It’s great to see people out shopping again,” he said. “I can’t wait to go to a pub or a restaurant. People need to enjoy themselves.”Johnson Re-Opens England’s Pubs But Scientists Warn of Long HaulAt the end of his answer, he inserted a crucial caveat: “I also want to see everybody being careful and following the guidance.” And he repeated that if the virus began to spread again, he would reimpose restrictions.But his emphasis was clear. Pubs, restaurants and hotels can reopen from July 4. To give their businesses a chance of working, the advice to people to keep a 2 meter distance from others has been changed: The distance is now 1 meter, so long as other mitigating measures are in place.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will make their own decisions about how and when to ease the lockdown.This means that for all Johnson’s drive to get life back to normal, it will still feel very different in July. Pubs will have to introduce table service and ordered queues, to replace the usual crowd at the bar trying to catch the landlord’s eye. Churches can open, but without singing. Weddings can go ahead, but with a maximum of 30 guests.In early March, the scientists advising the government warned that to lock down too early would risk a frustrated public starting to simply ignore it. Now the fear is in the opposite direction, that consumers will be too nervous to come out and spend.A poll from YouGov in mid-June found only 26% of people saying they’d be comfortable visiting a pub -- though twice that said they’d be happy to sit in the garden of one. In an effort to boost confidence, ministers spent Tuesday tweeting about their enthusiasm to get into a pub again -- even Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, who doesn’t drink.Cautions, CalculationsBut if the politicians were sending one signal, the scientists were sending a quite different one. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, standing alongside Johnson, warned: “If people hear a distorted version of what’s been said that says ‘this is all fine now, it’s gone away’ and start to behave in ways that they normally would have before the virus, then we will get an uptick, for sure.”Johnson’s calculation is that the U.K. is better-placed than it was in March to face such a rise. Its testing capacity is greatly expanded, it has many more ventilators, and the treatment of Covid-19 is better understood.But despite Johnson’s attempt to argue that the country was proceeding on the course to ease the lockdown that he set out in May, things have not been going entirely to plan. In the last seven days, an average 121 people died from the disease a day, and the average number of infections detected was 1,147. The mobile phone app that was supposed to sit at the heart of the contact-tracing program is nowhere in sight.And also on Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics reported that between Jan. 1 and June 12, there were 54,402 more deaths in England and Wales than average, another sign that the U.K. has been the hardest-hit country in Europe.While Johnson was trying to get the country to move on from the virus, there was a reminder that elsewhere too, politics can be difficult. Despite having a parliamentary majority of 80, the prime minister suffered his first defeat, on a vote about disciplinary procedures for members of the House of Commons, after 45 Conservatives voted against the party whip, including his predecessor Theresa May and Treasury Minister Penny Mordaunt. And on Wednesday, the opposition Labour Party is calling a debate on Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick’s handling of a planning application made by a Tory donor.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-gambles-on-lifting-lockdown-to-save-uk-s-economy/story-6W8AkgvqPPgds61mjPcKpM.html

Beijing’s mass testing of millions of its residents is on after a new cluster of cases emerged in late May.The Chinese capital reported 13 newly confirmed domestically-transmitted Covid-19 cases, two suspected infections and one asymptomatic on Monday, the municipal health commission said on Tuesday. From June 11 to 22, Beijing has reported 249 confirmed domestically-transmitted cases, all of whom were receiving treatment in hospitals, it said. Twenty-two asymptomatic cases are still under medical observation, it said. Just as the health officials of Beijing began to announce that the new coronavirus attack is getting under control, a delivery man from China’s leading food delivery platform ele.me in the city was confirmed to be infected with Covid-19. According to health authorities in Beijing, the 47-year-old delivery man had been offering services across a wide area in the capital between June 1 and June 17, involving the streets of Daxing, Fangshan, Dongcheng and Fengtai districts. It is the first case in the food delivery industry to have been confirmed in the capital, sparking widespread public concerns as residents rely heavily on delivery services for necessities amid the epidemic, sate-run Global Times reported on Tuesday. The patient delivered 50 orders a day on average in the past few weeks, according to the health authorities. The platform said that the company had conducted nucleic acid tests on its entire delivery staff. Delivery men who have had close contact with the infected persons have been barred from receiving orders and are now in quarantine at designated isolation centres, the platform said. Xu Hejian, spokesman for the municipal government, told the media on Monday that Beijing had effectively kept the coronavirus outbreak from spreading and the new local cases were decreasing as the capital uses multiple measures to reduce infections. “Beijing has contained the spread of Covid-19 cases,” Xu said, adding that the epidemic may be showing signs of abating. However, strict measures will remain in place because ending the outbreak remains a complicated task, he said.In the next step, Beijing will continue to implement the strict control and prevention network created in key areas such as restaurants, hospitals and schools. The city also will strengthen food safety controls and increase its nucleic acid testing ability, he said. So far, Beijing has designated four communities as high-risk and 39 as medium-risk for epidemic control. This represents targeted measures to contain the spread of the virus, including locking down communities in high-risk zones. Pang Xinghuo, deputy head of the Beijing Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, re-emphasised the importance of hand-washing and social distancing at Monday’s news conference. As of Saturday, about 2.3 million people in the capital had been tested for the novel coronavirus, the Beijing Health Commission said. By Monday, the overall confirmed cases in China had reached 83,418, including 359 patients who were still being treated, with 13 in severe condition. Altogether 78,425 people had been discharged after recovery and 4,634 people had died of the disease, the NHC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/food-delivery-man-may-be-beijing-s-coronavirus-new-super-spreader/story-h6rFV2xG9GdChkaTaJH3HN.html

His H-1B visa has expired and he is on extension, which is being granted easily by US authorities in view of the Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns. But if he or his wife were to travel to India or anywhere out of the US, they will be unable to return without getting their passports stamped with renewed visas.That was already a problem with consular operations closed at US missions, and now with the suspension until end of the year, it’s an even worse.“It feels just safer to stay in the US,” Desai said, adding, “things are so uncertain at this time.”Many Indians on H-1B or in line for Green Cards are stranded in India already because of no commercial flights. They have begun to make their way back, slowly.“This is a Hindu Ban much like the Muslim Ban,” said one of those impacted by the suspension, referring to the controversial ban imposed on the entry of people from some Muslim majority countries by Trump early on in his presidency, which remains in force, in a version diluted by legal challenges.This person may have actually meant an “India ban”, not a Hindu ban, because Indians, irrespective of their religion, have been the largest beneficiaries of the suspended H-1Bs and H-4, that are given to spouses of H-1B visa-holders cleared for the Green Card. It allows the spouses to work.Indians are the largest beneficiaries of both H-1Bs (more than 70% of the annual 85,000) and H-4 (for spouses and unmarried children). Indians accounted for 93% of the 126,853 H-4 EAD (employment authorization document) applications approved till December 2017, according to a study by the Congressional Research Service, a non-partisan provider of data and analysis to US congress, based on numbers from the USCIS.This is because the queue for Green Cards is the longest for Indians and the current waiting time is statistically estimated to be over 100 years. H-4 was introduced by President Barack Obama in 2015 as an incentive for these Green Card hopefuls. The Trump administration wants to rescind it.Pramila Jayapal, the Indian American congresswoman who led an joint appeal by lawmakers to the administration to not cancel H-4, slammed Trump’s new order in a post on twitter: “For months, Trump has been desperately trying to do anything to open the country back up and return to ‘normal’. EXCEPT for those who are immigrants seeking to contribute to this country,” she wrote, and added, “We must defeat Trump’s racist and white nationalist agenda.”But for some IT services companies that use H-1Bs to hire workers from India, or elsewhere, the Monday order was “not as bad as feared”.“I breathed a sigh of relief,,” said Deepali Khadakban, owner of New Jersey-based Precision Technologies. Based on news reports and speculation, they had expected a hike in H-1B visa processing fee, which is paid by the employer, a change in the qualification for H-1B, and an end of work authorization for graduates as part of their course.As of now, the suspension will only push the joining date for new hires coming from India, from October, the usual starting time, by a few months to December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/like-us-ban-on-muslims-anger-disquiet-and-some-relief-in-h-1b-circles/story-AFEHRXlELFVLHKNZmL2HZK.html

Indra Nooyi’s H-1B was one of the many stepping stones to the top of Pepsi.Satya Nadella used the visa programme also, but for an entirely different reason. Not to further his career, but his personal life. He gave up his Green Card — yes, he did — and went on H-1B so his wife could join in in the United States. Immigration rules then, as now, make it very difficult for foreigners to join Green Card spouses, without going through a long and uncertain process.So Nadella gave up his permanent residency and switched to H-1B in 1994, a year after he got married and four years after the new visa programme was introduced for high skilled workers in 1990.“What I didn’t expect was the instant notoriety around campus,” Nadella wrote in his 2017 memoir “Hit Refresh, “‘’Hey, there goes the guy who gave up his Green card’.”H-1B can do that to, help married couples unite.But for most people like Pichai and Nooyi, H-1Bs have been a gateway to work, live and prosper in the United States.Pichai came to the US F-1 visa for students; from IIT Kharagpur to Stanford University, California. He went on H-1B visa at McKinsey, and then went on to Google, which he has headed since 2015.Indra Nooyi, who was raised in Chennai and went to the Madras Christian College, went on H-1B visa when she joined the Boston Consulting Group in 1980, according to Business Insider. It was not immediately clear if she was on H-1 at the time, instead.

At the moment we’re still working on ways to make cricket more Covid-secure but we can’t change the guidance yet,” he added in the House of Commons.Clark believes that it is “absurd” that cricket cannot be played when it is one of the more socially-distanced game for players and spectators at most county clubs; many clubs have suffered severe losses due to cricket not being played.The England and Wales County Board has been discussing with the government the resumption of the game at the amateur level, including plans to limit the strength of each side to six or eight instead of 11.Johnson announced easing one of the key lockdown curbs – from 2-metre social distancing to 1-metre – that will allow pubs restaurants, museums, galleries and cinemas to reopen from July 4. The relaxation has been possible after the UK recorded dwindling number of infections in recent days and weeks.He said: “Most leisure facilities and tourist attractions will reopen if they can do so safely, including outdoor gyms and playgrounds, cinemas, museums, galleries, theme parks and arcades as well as libraries, social clubs and community centres”.“’Close proximity’ venues such as nightclubs, soft-play areas, indoor gyms, swimming pools and spas will need to remain closed for now, as will bowling alleys and water parks”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/resuming-cricket-not-yet-safe-says-uk-pm-boris-johnson/story-10Ljgv49iQ4Poeqtl9QroN.html
24-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Imperial College London’s vaccine human trial begins||The first healthy volunteer of a human trial of a vaccine developed by Imperial College London has received it, marking the start of the second such trial in the UK after the widely-watched one at the University of Oxford, which is now at an advanced stage.The college said on Tuesday that its clinical team that delivered a small dose of the vaccine at a west London facility is closely monitoring the participant and has reported that the person is in good health. The volunteer has asked to remain anonymous.The trial is the first test of a new self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) technology, which has the potential to revolutionise vaccine development and enable scientists to respond more quickly to emerging diseases, the college said, adding that the vaccine has undergone rigorous pre-clinical safety tests and in animal studies it has been shown to be safe and produced encouraging signs of an effective immune response.Katrina Pollock, chief investigator of the study, said: “We have reached a significant milestone in this ground-breaking study with the first dose of a self-amplifying RNA vaccine delivered safely. We are now poised to test the vaccine in the dose evaluation phase before moving forward to evaluating it in larger numbers”.The volunteer will receive second booster dose within four weeks, with several others due to receive their first dose over the coming days. In the initial stage of the trial, 15 healthy volunteers are receiving the vaccine – starting with a low dose and escalating to increasingly higher doses for subsequent volunteers – to assess safety and to find the optimal dosage.Over the coming weeks, 300 healthy participants are expected to receive two doses of the vaccine. If the vaccine is safe and shows a promising immune response in humans, then larger trials would be planned for later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-imperial-college-london-s-vaccine-human-trial-begins/story-BihwiBXz7eNWPIkx5jfA1N.html
