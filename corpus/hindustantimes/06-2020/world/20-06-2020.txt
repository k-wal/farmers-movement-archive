However, a specific mention of racism and police brutality in the US was removed.This sparked outrage from rights groups, which accused Washington and its allies of lobbying heavily to revise the text -- a charge to which the US mission in Geneva declined to respond.The United States, which had complained of being singled out in the initial text, withdrew from the council in 2018 and was not present on Friday.In his statement Saturday, titled “On the Hypocrisy of UN Human Rights Council,” Pompeo said discussion in the US about race following the death of Floyd “is a sign of our democracy’s strength and maturity.”“If the Council were serious about protecting human rights, there are plenty of legitimate needs for its attention, such as the systemic racial disparities in places like Cuba, China and Iran,” he said.“If the Council were honest, it would recognize the strengths of American democracy and urge authoritarian regimes around the world to model American democracy and to hold their nations to the same high standards of accountability and transparency that we Americans apply to ourselves,” Pompeo added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-says-un-vote-on-race-policing-in-us-is-hypocrisy/story-dOrCBIh5HcBmws0xo3td5N.html
20-06-2020||World||Thousands headed to indoor Trump’s Tulsa rally, raising coronavirus fears||Tens of thousands of people from many states are converging on Tulsa for an indoor rally and other campaign events Saturday for President Donald Trump, raising concerns that the gatherings could help fuel nascent spikes of coronavirus cases in many places.State and city health department officials were already bracing for a possible surge in COVID-19 cases from large outdoor demonstrations against police brutality held across the country. Now the Trump rally — at an indoor arena that can hold 19,000 people and is expected to be at capacity — is shaping up to be the first indoor event of such a massive scale since the coronavirus pandemic took hold and many states issued stay-at-home orders. Tulsa has seen the largest increase in cases in Oklahoma in recent days, and several bordering states, including Arkansas, have seen spikes in community spread of the virus in recent weeks.“I think there’s no question that indoor events are more risky than outdoor events. But we don’t really know how big that difference is. And certainly other aspects, like how tightly packed things are ... will make a big difference,” said Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.Lessler said large events like the rally or the protests have the “potential to be super spreader events,” but their potential to drive the pandemic is short-lived.“The larger factor is what happens when people go home,” he said. “If everybody goes home and doesn’t respect the social distancing factors and goes out into the community, then they could push the spread.”Tulsa County health officials have said they are particularly concerned about the event at the BOK Center because of a recent spike in cases: Oklahoma set a high for new cases last Thursday, with 450, and Tulsa saw 125 new cases Friday. Other health experts are worried that attendees could unknowingly take the virus back to their respective hometowns and states, seeding additional outbreaks.The Trump campaign acknowledged the risk in a waiver it asked attendees to sign that absolves them of any responsibility if someone should get sick. It has said it will hand out masks and hand sanitizer, but there is no requirement that participants use them. Attendees will also undergo a temperature check, but there will be no required social distancing at the indoor event expected to be at capacity.Trump also plans an outdoor event, and officials are expecting about 100,000 people to converge on the city.The rally comes a day after the head of the World Health Organization warned that the pandemic is “accelerating.” Outbreaks in the Americas were of particular concern, with Brazil surpassing 1 million confirmed infections, second only to the United States.Meanwhile, health officials are still eyeing the outdoor demonstrations against police brutality sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Those have gathered thousands of people together, in many instances not adhering to social-distancing recommendations or wearing masks. States and cities have not yet reported large upticks in virus cases since the protests began at the end of May, but it was unclear whether protesters have been seeking tests in large numbers or are self-quarantining after the events.California health officials have reported so far only a few people attending the demonstrations have tested positive for COVID-19, but contact tracing anyone they have infected is proving to be futile. During such tracing, ideally, a person who tests positive can provide names and contact information for people who had been around them — something that is proving difficult with strangers gathered by a moving protest.Health officials in Los Angeles County, Philadelphia and other cities where large demonstrations have been happening, including several Friday in honor of Juneteenth, have urged those attending to get tested or to consider self-quarantining for 14 days if they were around people without masks for as little as 15 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-headed-to-indoor-trump-s-tulsa-rally-raising-coronavirus-fears/story-TrmBKATjfl3VobozedGtJK.html
20-06-2020||World||Metal barriers, Trump gear: Crowd readies for Tulsa rally||Supporters of President Donald Trump were lining up Saturday outside metal barriers surrounding the Tulsa stadium where the president will hold his first rally in months, ready to welcome him back to the campaign trail despite warnings from health officials about the coronavirus.The crowd — including some who have have camped near the venue since early in the week — were hoping to be among the first inside the more than 19,000-seat BOK Center for what is expected to be the biggest indoor event the country has seen since restrictions to prevent the Covid-19 virus began in March. Trump also will speak at an outdoor event to be held inside the barriers.Protests also are planned for Saturday, and some Black leaders in Tulsa have said they’re worried the visit could lead to violence. It’s happening amid protests over racial injustice and policing across the U.S. and in a city that has a long history of racial tension. Officials said they expected some 100,000 people in Tulsa’s downtown.Renee Lamoreaux, a retiree and Trump supporter from Tulsa, said Friday that police officers had briefed ralliers, saying the event would basically be in a “big cage,” and the rest of the world would be outside. She said she felt reassured.Tulsa has seen cases of Covid-19 spike in the past week, and the local health department director asked that the rally be postponed. But Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said it would be safe. The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Friday denied a request that everyone attending the indoor rally wear a mask, and few in the crowd outside Saturday were wearing them.The Trump campaign said it will hand out masks and hand sanitizer, but there is no requirement that participants use them. Participants will also undergo a temperature check.The rally originally was planned for Friday, but was moved after complaints that it coincided with Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the U.S., and in a city that was the cite of a 1921 race-related massacre, when a white mob attacked Blacks, leaving as many as 300 people dead.Stitt said he will join Vice President Mike Pence for a meeting Saturday with Black leaders from Tulsa’s Greenwood District, the area where the 1921 attack occurred. Stitt initially invited Trump to tour the area, but said, “We talked to the African American community and they said it would not be a good idea, so we asked the president not to do that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/metal-barriers-trump-gear-crowd-readies-for-tulsa-rally/story-P1YVV2366ADqCAjT3XhuWI.html
20-06-2020||World||Pompeo blames China for border clashes with India, calls it ‘rogue actor’||US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has blamed China for escalating tensions along the border with India and called it a “rogue actor” in the neighborhood and indicated he may have raised the dispute and other such flashpoints in his meeting with his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi earlier in the week. “The PLA has escalated border tensions – we see it today in India, the world’s most popular – populous democracy.,” Pompeo said referring to the People’s Liberation Army, the Chinese military. “And we watch as it militarizes the South China Sea and illegally claims more territory there, threatening vital sea lanes, a promise they broke again”“But the CCP isn’t just a rogue actor in its own neighborhood,” he added, referring this time to the Chinese Communist Party by its initials. “If it was, we might think differently about it. It impacts us all. “The top US diplomat was participating in a virtual conference of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit on Friday.Pompeo went on to say, in response to a question about his meeting with Yang, “What I spent a good deal of my time speaking with Yang Jiechi about was the fundamental idea that we’re just watching actions. It’s no longer enough to listen to what the Chinese Communist Party is saying. We can see their actions. I ticked through a few of them: Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, what they’re doing in India, what they’ve done in the economic zones along the Philippines and Malaysia and Indonesia and Vietnam, the coercion on Australia – when they had the audacity to demand that there would be an investigation of how this virus got from Wuhan to Milan, how this virus got from Wuhan to Tehran, how this virus got from Wuhan to Oklahoma City, and to Belgium and to Spain, and decimating the global economy.”The readout issued of the meeting by the state department had did not have such granular details. But, again, it was not explicit from Pompeo’s remarks at the virtual conference if he did indeed bring up the India-China border clashes specifically or in a general way, covering all of China’s aggressive actions.Tensions between the United States and China have escalated significantly after the Covid-19 outbreak,. The Trump administration has sought to tie to China accusing it of not alerting the rest of the world on time and then by providing incorrect and misleading information about it. Pompeo calls it the Wuhan virus, after the city where it started. And President Donald Trump had called the “Chinese Virus”, “plague” and “gift” from China.There is very little patience for China in the United States, which made very clear its support for India in the ongoing border dispute with India form the early days. In May, Alice Wells, the former top diplomat for South and Central Asia had said the border flareups “were reminder that Chinese aggression is not always just rhetorical. We continue to see provocations and disturbing behavior by China that raises questions about how China wants to use its rising power”.President Trump had offered to mediate subsequently, late May, but was turned down by both India and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-blames-china-for-border-clashes-with-india-calls-it-rogue-actor/story-ZEBvjPMQY93mMfIdoTlB7L.html
20-06-2020||World||Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey lost ground in coronavirus fight||President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday Turkey had lost some ground in its battle with the coronavirus but a focus on hygiene, masks and social distancing will protect people and help the economy rebound in the second half of the year. This month, Ankara opened restaurants and cafes and lifted weekend stay-home orders and most intercity travel bans. But since June 1 new Covid-19 cases have doubled to nearly 1,600 per day, raising concerns of a re-emergence. “The numbers in recent days show that we have lost our position in the fight against the epidemic,” Erdogan said in a televised address. “But we aim to remove the pandemic from our agenda by respecting the cleaning, mask and distance rules.” As Turks have poured out into streets, parks, malls and to vacation spots, face masks were made compulsory in major cities on Thursday. On Friday new virus cases dipped to just over 1,200 with total cases at more than 185,000, the thirteenth highest in the world. A separate general lockdown of several hours was imposed Saturday so students could go out to attend high school exams. Some Turks posted pictures on social media of tightly packed crowds near schools and criticised the decision to hold tests. “Take a good look at these photos ... shame,” said one on Twitter. A week ago, Turkey’s top medical association criticised the decision to ease restrictions too soon.Health and government officials have told Reuters a harder line on social distancing may be adopted even while they said there is no plan to slow the economy, which emerged this month from a near standstill since mid-March. Most economists expect Turkey’s economy to contract this year. But Erdogan said economic recovery signals have been “quite strong” since May, adding “we expect great momentum from the second half of the year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tayyip-erdogan-says-turkey-lost-ground-in-coronavirus-fight/story-UAijNK8ug94y4D6tlgLXhO.html
20-06-2020||World||China unveils new security law for Hong Kong, will supersede local laws||China on Saturday unveiled details of the controversial new security law for Hong Kong amid international criticism that it will corrode the wide-ranging freedoms enjoyed by residents of the global financial hub.Details of the new law as listed by official news agency, Xinhua, includes setting up of a national security office for Hong Kong to handle crimes against national security.The local government must establish new institutions to protect national security and allow mainland agencies to operate in the city “when needed”.Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, will have the power to appoint judges to hear cases related to national security. The bottom line is clear, however.According to Xinhua: “For Hong Kong laws that are not in line with this [impending national security] law, this law’s requirements will apply, and the right to interpret this law lies with the National People’s Congress Standing Committee.”National security activities would protect human rights and freedom of speech and assembly, it added, without providing details.The Xinhua’s statement said that the legislation would make it clear that the Hong Kong government would need to respect and protect human rights as it safeguarded national security.“It must protect the freedoms of expression, the press, publication, association, assembly … that Hong Kong people enjoy under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,” it said.“Under Beijing’s plan, the Standing Committee will create a law for Hong Kong to prohibit acts of succession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign and external influences to threaten national security,’’ the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post said in a report on Saturday.Critics of the new law say it essentially ends the unique system of governance under the “one country, two systems” mechanism which has governed Hong Kong since the British handed it over to China in 1997.“This is the death knell for Hong Kong, make no mistake of it, this is the end of ‘one country, two systems’, the Hong Kong that we loved, a free Hong Kong,” pro-democracy lawmaker from Hong Kong Dennis Kwok was quoted by agencies as telling reporters on May 28 when the NPC had passed the security legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-unveils-new-security-law-for-hong-kong-will-supersede-local-laws/story-XlvhahTHIJ1QsgZH5aK7cJ.html
20-06-2020||World||US Embassy in Kabul battling Covid-19 infections||The US State Department says Covid-19 infections have been reported at its embassy in the Afghan capital and the staff who are affected include diplomats, contractors and locally employed staff.The State Department did not say how many were affected. An official at the embassy in Kabul, who could not be identified because of not being authorized to talk to the media, said as many as 20 people were infected, the majority of whom are Nepalese Gurkhas, who provide embassy security.“The embassy is implementing all appropriate measures to mitigate the spread of Covid-19,” the U.S. State department said.The infected staff are in isolation in the embassy while the remainder on the compound are being tested, said the embassy official, who also said the embassy staff have been told they can expect tighter isolation orders.Afghanistan has 28,424 confirmed coronavirus cases. International aid organizations monitoring the pandemic’s spread in the country say the numbers are much higher because of a lack of testing capabilities as well as access to testing. They also fear the highly contagious disease has spread throughout the country with the return of more than 200,000 Afghans from Iran, the hardest hit country in the region. Iran has recorded more than 200,000 cases and 9,392 deaths.Few of the Afghans who returned from Iran were tested before they fanned out across the country to their homes.Earlier this month the International Rescue Committee warned Afghanistan was on the brink of a humanitarian disaster mostly because the government does not have the capacity to even test 80% of coronavirus cases.Until now a handful of NATO troops have also tested positive for the infection.At the US Embassy, the State Department said a sanitization of the premises was being carried out to “prevent further outbreak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-embassy-in-kabul-battling-covid-19-infections/story-bp1KQVaHYeICRLds9PxiCJ.html
20-06-2020||World||WHO warns of ‘new, dangerous coronavirus phase’, Brazil, Europe pass bleak milestones||The coronavirus pandemic has passed grim milestones as Brazil confirmed one million infections and Europe chalked up more than 2.5 million Saturday as the World Health Organization warned of a “new and dangerous phase”.Death tolls in Colombia and Mexico also made grim reading -- passing 2,000 and 20,000, respectively -- as the virus tightened its grip in the Americas.Although the spread has slowed in Europe, it is still the worst-affected continent -- almost half of its 2.5 million cases being registered in Russia, Britain, Spain and Italy, according to an AFP tally on Saturday.The continent is easing its way out of strict lockdowns that have caused crippling economic damage, but the WHO warned against giving in to isolation fatigue.The virus has now killed more than 458,000 people and infected 8.6 million worldwide.A vaccine remains months off at best despite several trials, and scientists are still making daily discoveries about the virus, its symptoms and the extent to which it may have spread before being identified.- ‘Still spreading fast’ -Brazil reported a one-day record of nearly 55,000 infections on Friday, becoming the second country to pass one million cases after the United States -- the only country with higher numbers of deaths and cases.The health ministry said the jump was caused by “instability” in its reporting system, which delayed previous days’ figures for some states.Brazil’s death toll now stands at nearly 49,000, and has risen by more than 1,000 each of the past four days -- although its curve finally appears to be starting to flatten.Authorities in Mexico City meanwhile pushed back a planned reopening of the economy from next week to the following week, saying the rate of infection was still too high.Argentina, which is reeling from the economic impact of the health crisis, bought more time to negotiate a $66 billion debt restructuring with creditors, who agreed to extend the deadline once again, to July 24.“The world is in a new and dangerous phase,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference.“Many people are understandably fed up with being at home... but the virus is still spreading fast.”- ‘I cried with joy’ -In Europe, researchers in Italy said they had found evidence the virus was present in December -- about the same time the disease was first reported in China.They discovered genetic traces in samples of waste water collected in several cities, the ISS institute said.Italy confirmed its first cases in February and imposed a strict lockdown in March.Much of the continent followed Italy into lockdown and shops, restaurants and other businesses have only slowly reopened. Millions of children in France are preparing to return to school on Monday after three months away.“I cried with joy when I got the confirmation from the teacher that my two children would be going back to school full time,” said Noemie from Nice.France is also reopening cinemas from Monday and stadiums for team sports, and in another sign of returning normality, actors have also started kissing again on film shoots.“No, the kiss is not finished,” French Culture Minister Franck Riester declared when asked if social distancing was in danger of killing off love scenes.But Asian countries continue to provide cautionary tales -- China being the latest nation to have eased restrictions after controlling the virus, only to find itself battling a new outbreak.The cluster, linked to a wholesale market in Beijing, has sparked a nationwide campaign to inspect food imports after officials suggested imported frozen food could be to blame.- Trump hits campaign trail -The United States has the highest death toll by far, at more than 119,000, and the world’s largest economy is taking a beating in a year when President Donald Trump seeks re-election.However, the president has been consistently critical of lockdown measures and plans to hold his first mass rally in months later on Saturday.Some 19,000 people are expected to attend the event, where they will be required to sign a disclaimer to ensure the president will not be held liable if they contract the virus.“My campaign hasn’t started yet. It starts on Saturday night in Oklahoma!” Trump tweeted before the rally in Tulsa, which has been widely derided by his opponents.One supporter, who gave her name as Jody while waiting in line with her five-year-old son dressed as a mini-Trump, said she would be wearing a mask but expected that many others would not.“I wish people would wear them, but you can’t force people to do something they don’t want to do,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-of-new-dangerous-coronavirus-phase-brazil-europe-pass-bleak-milestones/story-HVuRItlbYy5PtfowB0GsnO.html

The review applies to England as Britain’s devolved nations - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - have their own powers over health rules. Johnson has come under heavy criticism for his handling of the pandemic. Britain has the third highest number of coronavirus deaths after the United States and Brazil.Johnson, who says the government has followed scientific advice in its approach, has to balance the need to revive the economy after its 20% collapse in April without allowing a resurgence in cases.Britain’s retail sector has already been allowed to re-open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-rishi-sunak-sees-enormous-difference-after-social-distance-review/story-gCKABwX9epwH1LFlV9pLxN.html
20-06-2020||World||Pope Francis hails Italy coronavirus doctors, nurses as heroes||Pope Francis welcomed doctors and nurses from the coronavirus-ravaged region of Lombardy to the Vatican on Saturday to thank them for their selfless work and “heroic” sacrifice.Francis dedicated one of his first post-lockdown audiences to Italy’s front-line medical and civil protection personnel, telling the delegation that their example of professional competence and compassion would help Italy forge a new future of hope and solidarity.The northern region of Lombardy, Italy’s financial and industrial capital, was the hardest-hit region in the onetime European epicenter of the pandemic. Lombardy has counted more than 92,000 of Italy’s 232,000 official infections and half of the country’s 34,500 dead.Francis noted that some of those dead were the doctors and nurses themselves, and said Italy would remember them with “prayer and gratitude.” More than 40 nurses and 160 doctors died during the outbreak nationwide, and nearly 30,000 health care personnel were infected.Francis said Lombardy’s medics and nurses became literal “angels” helping the sick recover or accompanying them to their death, given their family members were prevented from visiting them in the hospital.Speaking off the cuff, Francis praised the “little gestures of creativity of love” they provided: a caress or the use of their cell phone “to bring together the old person who was about to die with his son or daughter to say goodbye, to see them for the last time...”“This was so good for all of us: testimony of proximity and tenderness,” Francis said.In the audience were the bishops of some of the hardest-hit cities in Lombardy, as well as representatives of Italy’s civil protection agency, which coordinated the emergency response and built field hospitals around the region. They sat well-spaced apart and wore protective masks in the frescoed audience hall in the Apostolic Palace.The pope said he hoped Italy would emerge morally and spiritually stronger from the emergency and the lesson of interconnection that it taught: that individual and collective interests are intertwined.“It’s easy to forget that we need one another, someone to take care of us and give us courage,” he said.The encounter was only the second time Francis has welcomed a group into the Vatican for an audience since the Vatican locked down in early March along with the rest of Italy to try to contain the virus. The first was a small encounter May 20 with a group of athletes who are raising money for hospitals in two hard-hit Lombardy cities, Brescia and Bergamo.At the end of the audience, Francis made sure that the doctors and nurses kept their distance, telling them he would come to them rather than have them line up to greet him and kiss his ring, as was the Vatican’s pre-pandemic practice.“We have to be obedient to the dispositions” of social distancing, he said.Lombardy’s governor, Attilio Fontana, who headed the delegation, invited Francis to visit Lombardy so he could also bring words of hope and consolation to those who are still sick, and to the families who lost loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-hails-italy-coronavirus-doctors-nurses-as-heroes/story-AQlG7NHkbHE5NN0Wr5dIVI.html
20-06-2020||World||Pakistan registers record single-day Covid-19 deaths, cases cross 171,000||Pakistan on Saturday reported 153 coronavirus deaths, the highest spike in a single-day in the country, while the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases crossed the 171,000-mark, health officials said.According to the Ministry of National Health Services, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Pakistan rose to 171,665 after 6,604 new infections were recorded in the last 24 hours. The total death toll stands at 3,382 after 153 more deaths were registered.The ministry said that 63,504 people have recovered so far across Pakistan, making it a significant count. Out of the total infection so far, Sindh has 65,163, Punjab 64,216, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 20,790, Islamabad 10,279, Balochistan 9,162, Gilgit Baltistan 1,253 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 803 infected patients.There are 810 hospitals with Covid-19 facilities, with 6,980 patients admitted across the country, according to the ministry.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s aviation ministry on Friday said that the international flight operations in the country will resume from Saturday after nearly three months.The aviation said that the permission for international flight operations would be subject to restrictions in light of the current Covid-19 scenario and implementation of health protocols.“Government of Pakistan has been pleased to authorise International Flight Operations to/ from All International Airports of Pakistan except Gwadar and Turbat airports, with effect from June 20, 2020, 0001 PST,” according to the statement by the aviation ministry.The cargo, special and diplomatic flights would continue to be authorised as per procedure in vogue and adherence to the relevant applicable standard operating procedures would be mandatory for all airline operators.The government on Wednesday announced a new policy for inbound passengers with a resolve to transport approximately 200,000 people within a month, the Dawn newspaper reported.The implementation of the new policy will start from Saturday which the government said would bring significant enhancement in the capacity to bring back stranded Pakistanis from across the world.On March 21, Pakistan suspended all international flight operations to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-registers-record-single-day-covid-19-deaths-cases-cross-171-000/story-7zSyqMQb2mVQkJwTNQsfmI.html

20-06-2020||World||Beijing sees drop in coronavirus cases, Brazil passes 1 million-mark||China’s capital recorded a further drop in coronavirus cases amid tightened containment measures, while Brazil surpassed 1 million confirmed infections, second only to the United States.Europe, in contrast, continues to emerge warily from lockdown, with hard-hit Britain considering easing social distancing rules to make it easier for restaurants, pubs and schools to reopen.Officials reported 22 new cases in Beijing on Saturday, along with five others elsewhere in China. There were no new deaths and 308 people remained hospitalized for treatment.South Korea recorded 67 new cases, the largest 24-hour increase in about three weeks. Most of them come from the densely populated Seoul area, where about half of the country’s 51 million people reside. Many cases have been linked to exposure in nightlife outlets.The head of the World Health Organization said Friday that the pandemic is “accelerating” and that more than 150,000 cases were reported the day before — the highest single-day number so far.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva that nearly half of the newly reported cases were from the Americas, with significant numbers from South Asia and the Middle East.Brazil’s Health Ministry said the total number of cases had risen by more than 50,000 from the previous day. President Jair Bolsonaro still downplays the risks of the virus after nearly 50,000 fatalities in three months, saying the impact of social isolation on Brazil’s economy could be more deadly.The new coronavirus has infected more than 8.5 million people worldwide and killed more than 454,000, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The actual number is thought to be much higher because many cases are asymptomatic or go untested.South Africa and Ethiopia say they are recommending the limited use of the commonly available steroid dexamethasone for all COVID-19 patients on ventilators or supplementary oxygen. In a British trial, the drug was shown to significantly improve survival chances for the most seriously ill.South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said “this breakthrough is excellent news for us and we are especially fortunate that it came as we are preparing for our upcoming surge” in cases. South Africa has about 30% of the virus cases on the African continent, or more than 87,000.South Africa continues to loosen lockdown measures under economic pressure, despite reporting nearly 4,000 more COVID-19 cases on Saturday. Casinos, beauty salons and sit-down restaurant service are among the latest permitted activities as the country eases one of the world’s strictest lockdowns.Britain lowered its coronavirus threat level one notch, becoming the latest country to claim it’s getting a national outbreak under control.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government says it will announce next week whether it will ease social distancing rules that say people should remain 2 meters (6½ feet) apart. Business groups are lobbying for that to be cut to 1 meter (3 feet) to help restart the country’s economy.While many stores in Britain have reopened, pubs, hotels and restaurants won’t be allowed to restart until July 4 at the soonest. Proposals to allow them to reopen safely include pubs having people order pints using phone apps rather than going to the bar.The U.K. has suffered Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with more than 42,000 confirmed fatalitiesMeanwhile, Germany reported the country’s highest daily increase in virus cases in a month after managing to contain its outbreak better than comparable large European nations.French authorities are keeping a close eye on signs of an accelerating spread of the coronavirus in Normandy, a region that’s until now been spared the worst of the outbreak that has hit Paris and the east of France particularly hard.The emergencies chief of the World Health Organization has confirmed that China shared coronavirus sequences from its latest outbreak with the global community and says it appears the virus was imported to Beijing from strains circulating in Europe.At a press briefing on Friday, Dr. Michael Ryan noted that “strains and viruses have moved around the world” throughout the pandemic. Ryan said that many viruses in New York “were of European origin” but that doesn’t mean Europe necessarily was the original source.He said analysis of the genetic sequences so far suggests that the virus spread to people in China from other humans instead of jumping from animals directly into humans.___Lawless reported from London.

Johnson, who says his government has followed scientific advice in its handling of the pandemic, has to balance the need to revive the economy after its 20% collapse in April without allowing a resurgence in coronavirus cases.Britain has the third-highest number of coronavirus deaths after the United States and Brazil.Britain’s devolved nations - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - have their own powers over health rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-conclude-england-s-two-metre-covid-19-rule-review-soon-says-minister/story-JOOFvKXYNYkhLPeFkrnqzJ.html
20-06-2020||World||Black Lives Matter: UK parliament to review iconic colonial India painting||A large mural painting in the UK parliament depicting a defining moment in early 17th century laying the foundation of British influence in India is being reviewed for its contemporary relevance in the context of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) campaign.The painting by noted artist William Rothenstein (1872-1945) unveiled in 1927 is one of eight depicting important historical events as part of ‘The Building of Britain’ series in St Stephen’s Hall in the parliament complex, which has thousands of pieces of art, many with racist history.The review follows demands as part of the BLM campaign to remove statues and symbols with links to racism and slavery from public places. Campaigners have identified several statues in London and elsewhere that they want removed, with local councils across the UK initiating similar reviews.The Rothenstein painting depicts the first British diplomatic representative, Thomas Roe (1581-1644), in the court of Mughal emperor Jahangir in Ajmer in 1616. Roe was sent to India by King James I in 1614 to establish diplomatic relations with the Mughal empire.By the time Roe reached India, the East India Company (formed in December 1600) had established its first presence with a factory at Surat. Roe’s main task was to seek Jahangir’s support for this venture and negotiate a treaty enabling further trade.By the end of his period as ambassador in 1618, Roe had secured commercial access to Jahangir’s dominions, though a formal treaty was never signed. According to the British view, he succeeded “by his courtesy and firmness” at Jahangir’s court to lay the foundation of British influence in India.Senior Labour MP Virendra Sharma welcomed the painting’s review as part of the wider examination of art in the parliament complex: “Its relevance must be reviewed in the context of today’s social, political and economic climate. But it should be done in a logical way, not driven by prejudice”.Confirming that the Rothenstein painting is part of the wider review of art, a UK parliament spokesperson said: “The interpretation of the artworks is constantly under review and we will look at ways to contextualise the lives of those depicted”.“The Speaker’s Advisory Committee on Works of Art and the Lord Speaker’s Advisory Panel on Works of Art are also actively working to improve the diversity of the art collection, both in terms of the people portrayed and in the artists commissioned to ensure that the collection reflects and celebrates the diversity of all who contribute to parliament.”The Speaker’s Advisory Committee met this week and reiterated its commitment to broaden the representation of women and BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) groups. Officials said recently articulated concerns about works of art within the parliament complex are being taken “very seriously”.They said they are also reviewing information the UK parliament provides online ensure its correct context, besides exploring other ways of disseminating information, such as through printed information given to visitors (leaflets) and via parliament’s social media channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-uk-parliament-to-review-iconic-colonial-india-painting/story-ON2DyEMr5gVeghZdhla7BP.html
20-06-2020||World||PM Trudeau ‘disappointed’ over detention of 2 Canadians by China||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has expressed disappointment over the decision by Chinese authorities to foist espionage charges against two Canadians, including a former diplomat, who have been detained in China for over 550 days.Trudeau’s statement was followed by the country’s Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne calling for the immediate release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, asserting they had been “arbitrarily detained.”Their arrests have been deemed by analysts as hostage diplomacy undertaken by Beijing, as the moves followed the detention of a senior executive of the Chinese telecom firm Huawei in Vancouver in 2018. That executive, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in December 2018 and is on trial for a case related to fraud that could ultimately lead to her extradition to the United States. She also happens to be the daughter of Huawei’s founder.“We will continue to use all of our expertise to return these two Michaels to Canada,” Trudeau said in response to a question during his daily media briefing in Ottawa.Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland was somewhat more outspoken in her reaction, as she said she was “very angry” at the Chinese action In charging the two with espionage. “Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are two very great Canadians who are behaving incredibly decent in the difficult circumstances that they have been placed in and absolutely at no fault of their own,” she said during a media interaction, according to the outlet Global News.In a statement, the International Crisis Group, where Kovrig worked as a senior adviser, blasted the Chinese prosecution, stating, “This is yet another arbitrary and baseless step in a case that has been arbitrary and baseless from day one.”Canada’s Foreign Minister said the cases of Kovrig and Spavor “remain a top priority for the Government of Canada.” He also expressed concern over how they were since China has denied Canada consular access since January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-trudeau-disappointed-over-detention-of-2-canadians-by-china/story-RcO0bhCKFsV2IJTH4gJJGJ.html
20-06-2020||World||New railway line in Tibet will reach Arunachal doorstep in 2021||China is building infrastructure at a rapid speed and encouraging wealthier provinces to make critical investments along the border areas of Tibet with Arunachal Pradesh.On Saturday, state-owned companies completed part of a key railway bridge on the Yarlung Tsangpo, which flows into India as Siang and then Brahmaputra river, barely 30 km from the border with Arunachal Pradesh.It is part of the 435-km railway project linking Lhasa and Nyingchi, also known as Linzhi, in southwest China’s Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR).Experts say once completed, it will be a “dual use” – civil and military – bridge reaching until the terminus of the line is likely to be just across the border of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims is part of south Tibet.The Zang Mu Yarlung Tsangpo river double-lane bridge is over 525 metres long and is a key bridge in the project.It is located across the Yarlung between mountains on both sides.On April 7, China’s official media announced that construction work on the last two of the 47 tunnels on the 435-km railway was completed.At least 75 percent of the Lhasa-Nyingchi railway comprises bridges and tunnels, and over 90 percent of the railway is on the Tibetan plateau at over 3,000 metres or more than 15000 feet above sea level.“As Tibet’s first electric railway, it has a designed speed of 160 km per hour.Over 20,000 builders have been working on the railway since the end of 2014. It is expected to be completed and put into operation in 2021.China has also built a network of highways across TAR with links to Nyingchi.In 2018, it opened a 409-km new expressway costing about $5.8 billion linking Lhasa with Nyingchi.The expressway cuts Lhasa-Nyingchi travel time from eight to five hours at a speed limit of 80 km per hour.The TAR’s airport infrastructure has rapidly improved as well.By the end of 2019, the region had five airports and 11 airlines operating a total of 101 routes, enabling convenient connections between Tibet and 51 cities.As part of a broader policy, Beijing has also begun to encourage wealthier Chinese provinces to invest in TAR, especially in border areas like Nyingchi.Less than two weeks ago, 26 construction projects in sectors like infrastructure, public services and tourism were officially launched in Nyingchi to be sponsored by southern China’s industrial powerhouse, the province of Guangdong.For 2020, Guangdong has planned 51 projects in Nyingchi with a total investment of 543 million yuan or around $78 million.Poverty alleviation is part of President Xi Jinping’s plan to encourage Tibetan herders to settle down in remote locations close to the Arunachal Pradesh border.Xi had written a letter to a herding family in Lhunze County in southwest China’s TAR to set down roots in the border area, safeguard the Chinese territory and develop their hometown in 2017.In the letter, Xi thanked them for the loyalty and contributions they have made to safeguard the border area. “Without the peace in the territory, there will be no peaceful lives for the millions of families,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-railway-line-in-tibet-will-reach-arunachal-doorstep-in-2021/story-fT9mBNIozkqCqLXfcPD67L.html
20-06-2020||World||No mention of Hong Kong security law as China closes meeting||The body that handles most lawmaking for China’s top legislative body closed its latest meeting Saturday with no mention of passing a highly controversial national security law for Hong Kong.The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress dealt with numerous agenda items but said nothing about the fate of the security legislation that has been strongly criticized as undermining the semi-autonomous territory’s legal and political institutions, China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported.The bill was submitted Thursday for deliberation, covering four categories of crimes: succession, subversion of state power, local terrorist activities and collaborating with foreign or external foreign forces to endanger national security.Beijing has repeatedly said it is determined to press ahead with the legislation despite heavy criticism from within Hong Kong and abroad, including from the U.S., which says it will revoke some of the preferential conditions extended toward the city after its transfer from British to Chinese rule in 1997.Britain has said it will offer passports and a path to citizenship to as many as 3 million Hong Kong residents. Group of Seven leading economies called on China to reconsider its plans, issuing a joint statement voicing “grave concern” over the legislation that is said would breach Beijing’s international commitments as well as the territory’s constitution.Beijing has repeatedly denounced the moves as rank interference in its internal affairs.Li Zhanshu, the ruling Communist Party’s third-ranking official and head of the National People’s Congress, presided over the meeting of the Standing Committee, which handles most legislative tasks in between the annual sessions of the full and largely ceremonial congress.In its full session last month, the congress ratified a decision to enact such legislation at the national level after Hong Kong’s own Legislative Council was unable to do so because of strong local opposition. Critics say the law could severely limit free speech and opposition political activity.Legal experts say Beijing’s justifications for the law are debatable.The Hong Kong Bar Association on Friday called on the city’s government to reveal details of the bill and warned that the law’s enforcement in Hong Kong risked setting up a system of conflicting parallel legal standards dominated by Beijing.“It raises the question whether individuals will be tried within the criminal justice system in (Hong Kong) by the Hong Kong courts or sent to the Mainland for trial and serve any terms of imprisonment in Mainland prisons,” the bar association said in a statement emailed to reporters.China acted following widespread and sometimes violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year that Beijing saw as a dangerous campaign to split the territory from the rest of the country. Tho protests were initially spurred by opposition to proposed legislation that could have seen criminal suspects sent to the mainland for trials in China’s highly opaque legal system, along with possible torture and abuse. The extradition bill was eventually scrapped.China has sought to assuage concerns by saying the new legislation would only target “acts and activities that severely undermine national security,” according to Xinhua.The legislation is broadly seen as an additional measure further eroding the legal distinctions between Hong Kong and mainland China.Earlier this month, Hong Kong’s legislature approved a contentious bill making it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem after pro-democracy lawmakers boycotted the vote out of protest.Senior opposition figures have also been arrested for taking part in demonstrations, and questions have arisen over whether the national security legislation will be used to disqualify pro-democracy candidates in September’s elections for the Beijing-controlled Legislative Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-mention-of-hong-kong-security-law-as-china-closes-meeting/story-difxUZ6chzfSzdQTt11T0O.html

The outbreak, the first in Beijing in months, has now surpassed previous peak numbers in early February.Follow latest updates on coronavirus hereTesting for Covid-19 initially focused on residential areas near the sprawling Xinfadi market and on people who worked or shopped there. Officials are now targeting the tens of thousands of delivery personnel who regularly traverse the city, where fleets of motorised pedicabs and scooters ridden by couriers delivering parcels and food are a common sight.Workers at SF Express, China’s second biggest courier firm, arrived in batches at testing points in Beijing on Friday evening, Beijing News reported. Also read: Experts speculate presence of super spreader as Beijing Covid-19 cases cross 200Food delivery firm Meituan Dianping confirmed on Friday all its Beijing riders would be tested and those who had carried out deliveries in high-risk areas would be temporarily taken off duty, undergo nucleic acid tests and be quarantined at home for 14 days.Customers will be able to view details on disinfection of the delivery package and their courier’s body temperature online, Meituan said on its Wechat acccount.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Beijing News said that all couriers in the city would be tested by next week.Officials have highlighted the risk of contamination through packaging in Beijing, which reported 22 new cases on Friday.

20-06-2020||World||Greece culls migrant support groups in ‘transparency’ overhaul||Dozens of groups helping asylum seekers in Greece risk being edged out in a government move to tighten what it calls “opaque” rules overseeing charities, sparking concern that crucial support will be cut.Critics warn that the new registration regulations will downgrade services to thousands of vulnerable and traumatised people that were, in many cases, already barely adequate.“We seek as much transparency as possible in the operation of NGOs, and of people working for, or cooperating, with them,” Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said in April.Greece’s conservative government, which was voted in nearly a year ago and whose policy is to make the country a “less attractive” destination to migrants, says that new NGO registration rules are needed because the groups have run projects in the last four years “in their own way” under an “opaque” framework.But Minos Mouzourakis, legal officer for Refugee Support Aegean, is worried that the change could hamper the independent oversight role often played by NGOs. NGOs highlight abuses It is often support groups that highlight alleged abuses by coastguards or police and take legal action against the Greek state on behalf of asylum seekers, he noted.“The ministry evaluates independent organisations that often criticise it... it should not have such (powers)... it’s a question of impartiality,” he said.Mitarachi has complained that out of 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in EU support funds for Greek migration projects between 2015 and 2019, the Greek state managed just 1.9 percent.“Do you want to hand over the keys to NGOs? I don’t want that,” he told parliament this month.The new registration process includes budget scrutiny and criminal background checks for workers and volunteers. Each group’s field performance in the last two years is also probed.“This essentially helps NGOs themselves to know who is working for them,” the ministry’s asylum secretary Manos Logothetis told AFP.“Shouldn’t they know if, for instance, there is a paedophile working with minors?” he said.On Wednesday, 22 out of 40 groups active in Greek camps were eliminated from a first approval phase.Elected officials acknowledge that support groups were key at the height of Europe’s migrant crisis, especially after other EU states shut their borders in 2016 and tens of thousands of asylum seekers were trapped in Greek camps.More than a million migrants and refugees arrived in Greece in 2015 and 2016, according to the UN refugee agency. There are now around 120,000 in the country.Yiorgos Kaminis, Athens mayor in 2011-2019, has noted that “without (NGO) contribution, the incompetent Greek state would have been overwhelmed”.But, insiders have noted, there was also significant overlap.“Early on, you might have had five different groups running education programmes,” one organisation member said.According to an internal document seen by AFP, earlier this year there were more than 20 support groups in the largest Greek camp of Moria on Lesbos island.Beyond medical and legal assistance, the help offered included laundry services, self-defence and yoga, classes in Greek, English, music and IT, and pregnancy healthcare.One group handled plumbing for the heavily overcrowded camp of more than 16,000 people.It was not immediately clear how many of these organisations have been allowed to stay on.“The Greek government leads the refugee response, and the expertise and strengths of civil society and NGOs is still crucial,” the UN refugee agency’s spokesman in Greece Boris Cheshirkov said in a statement to AFP.In frontline Greek areas bearing the brunt of migration management, some locals claim that NGOs have a vested interest in seeing the migration crisis drag on. NGOs attacked on Lesbos In March, refugee support groups on Lesbos were targeted in the worst surge of violence since mass arrivals began in 2015.Angry mobs attacked cars with NGO markings after a new wave of migration encouraged by Turkey saw hundreds of asylum seekers arrive on Lesbos.“We can understand that the new government wants to establish a register for NGOs, if this is to gain greater control over who is actually working with these vulnerable people,” said Caroline Hervik, of Reaching, a small volunteer group of mainly Norwegian students working on the island of Chios.But because the registration process is “complex” and requires a Greek representative, Reaching’s work is currently on hold, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-culls-migrant-support-groups-in-transparency-overhaul/story-A8XkDJnnO1xlphD5upDSjM.html
20-06-2020||World||Greta Thunberg has hope for climate, despite leaders’ inaction||Preparing for her appearance before the U.N. General Assembly last fall, Greta Thunberg found herself constantly interrupted by world leaders, including U.N. chief Antonio Guterres and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had formed a queue to speak to her and take selfies.“Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, waits in line but doesn’t quite make it before it’s time for the event to start,” Thunberg recalls.Such surreal memories for a teenager form the opening to a 75-minute monologue broadcast on Swedish public radio Saturday that soon shifts to the serious matter of climate change that’s at the heart of Thunberg’s work.The 17-year-old has become a global figurehead of the youth climate movement since she started her one-woman protests outside the Swedish parliament in 2018.Thunberg’s blunt words to presidents and prime ministers, peppered with scientific facts about the need to urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions, have won her praise and awards, but also the occasionalpushback and even death threats.To Thunberg’s disappointment, her message doesn’t seem to be getting through even to those leaders who applaud her work.The message is certainly stark: Thunberg cites a U.N. report that estimates the world can only keep emitting the current amount of carbon dioxide for the next seven-and-a-half years. Any longer and it becomes impossible to meet the Paris climate accord’s ambitious goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century.Most governments refuse to accept the idea that the world has only a fixed “carbon budget” left, because it implies that a sudden shift away from fossil fuel will need to happen in just a few years.“Do you remember the London Olympics? ‘Gangnam Style’ or the first ‘Hunger Games’ movie?” Thunberg asks her audience on Swedish radio station P1. “Those things all happened about seven or eight years ago. That’s the amount of time we’re talking about.”Her months-long journey from Sweden to America’s West Coast and back — by train, sailboat and an electric car loaned by Arnold Schwarzenegger — highlighted the impact that global warming is already having, from melting glaciers to fiercer forest fire seasons, Thunberg said.It also opened her eyes to economic and social disparities affecting in particular Indigenous, Black and minority communities, voices she has sought to amplify in the climate debate.“The climate and sustainability crisis is not a fair crisis,” Thunberg says. “The ones who’ll be hit hardest from its consequences are often the ones who have done the least to cause the problem in the first place. ”Her frustration extends to journalists who want to know about “the real Greta” but interrupt her when she talks about the science of climate change.“People want something simple and concrete, and they want me to be naive, angry, childish, and emotional,” Thunberg says. “That is the story that sells and creates the most clicks.”Thunberg blasts governments and businesses that use what she calls “creative accounting” to makes their emissions look lower than they are and apply the word “green” to industries that are not.“The emperors are naked. Every single one,” she says. “It turns out our whole society is just one big nudist party.”Some critics have accused Thunberg of being a doom-monger. But she insists that her message is one of hope, not despair.“There are signs of change, of awakening,” she says. “Just take the ‘Me Too’ movement, ‘Black Lives Matter’ or the school strike movement (for climate action) for instance,” she says, adding that the world has passed a “social tipping point” where it becomes impossible to look away.The global response to the Covid-19 pandemic may provide a necessary wake-up call, she suggests.“The corona tragedy of course has no long term positive effects on the climate, apart from one thing only: namely the insight into how you should perceive and treat an emergency. Because during the corona crisis we suddenly act with necessary force.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-has-hope-for-climate-despite-leaders-inaction/story-wsfSPjpB6bVapb2fZvZGKJ.html
20-06-2020||World||China reports 34 new coronavirus cases; submits virus genome sequence to WHO||China has reported 34 new coronavirus cases, including 22 in Beijing, where the health officials have submitted the virus genome sequence from the recent clusters of Covid-19 infections to the World Health Organisation, officials said on Saturday.The National Health Commission (NHC) said 34 new cases, including seven asymptomatic infections of the Covid-19 were reported in the country.Twenty-two domestically transmitted cases were reported in Beijing and one in Hebei Province, the NHC said.It said 108 asymptomatic cases, including 57 from overseas, were still under medical observation.Beijing reported 22 newly confirmed domestically-transmitted Covid-19 cases and two asymptomatic cases on Friday, the municipal health commission said on Saturday.By the end of Friday, Beijing had reported 625 confirmed domestically-transmitted cases, including 411 who had been discharged from hospitals after recovery and nine deaths. There were 17 asymptomatic cases still under medical observation.The NHC said on Saturday that mainland China till now has reported 83,352 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 4,634 deaths.The officials alleged the new strain of the virus in Beijing came from Europe.So far, 174 imported cases have been reported in Beijing, with one still hospitalised.The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released the virus genome sequence from the recent clusters of Covid-19 infections related to Beijing’s Xinfadi wholesale farm produce market.The data, released through the Novel Coronavirus National Science and Technology Resource Service System on Thursday came from both Covid-19 case samples and environmental samples.The CDC has submitted the relevant genome sequence to the WHO and the global initiative on sharing all influenza data to share the data globally.Chinese virologists alleged the strain of the new virus in Beijing has European origin.An initial epidemiological survey shows the coronavirus strain detected at the Xinfadi wholesale market in Beijing came from Europe, a report in state-run Global Times said.It said the strain had existed longer than the current coronavirus strain circulating in Europe, Chinese virologists inferred.They say it is possible that the virus did not mutate during transport as it was sealed in frozen food, stored in cold and damp conditions, it said.Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, told the media on Thursday that the “findings at Beijing reminded us of the first outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan last year, which happened at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market”.The focus of the Huanan investigation was the wild animal stalls, even though the seafood sellers were right next to them, Wu said.The WHO has already questioned the Chinese officials’ claims that the virus was traced to the imported salmon in Xinfadi and purported origins to Europe saying that there is no evidence to back it.Ever since US President Donald Trump blamed China for not containing the Covid-19 when it first showed up in Wuhan in December last year, the debate over the origin of the virus has intensified.For its part, China sought to shift the blame saying that the virus may have been originated elsewhere and surfaced in Wuhan.President Trump and leaders of several countries have accused China of not being transparent in reporting the deadly disease, leading to huge human casualties and economic crisis across the world.A new study by Harvard researchers recently said satellite images show an increase in traffic outside five hospitals in the Chinese city from late August to December raising doubts that the virus may have surfaced in Wuhan by that time.The traffic spike coincided with a rise in online searches for information on symptoms like “cough” and “diarrhoea”.China said the study was “ridiculous” and based on “superficial” information, it said.Recently, the World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the Geneva-based WHO, passed a unanimous resolution to probe the origin of the virus. China also backed the resolution.Most of the new cases have been linked to the Xinfadi wholesale food market.Until a week ago, the Chinese capital had been free of local transmission for 55 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-34-new-coronavirus-cases-submits-virus-genome-sequence-to-who/story-gyqq82SkLDkpSOW5YS6JGN.html

President Alejandro Giammattei pushed out Health Minister Hugo Monroy and named Amelia Flores, a former vice minister of health in an earlier administration, as his replacement.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMonroy, who had held the position since January, had been harshly criticized for his management of the pandemic. Federal lawmakers called him in multiple times for questioning and complained that the Health Ministry was spending too little of its budget during the pandemic. During his tenure, doctors from the public health system protested that they weren’t being paid. Images of hospitals overwhelmed by the sick have increasingly painted a grim picture of the situation in Guatemala. Guatemala has reported more than 11,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 449 deaths. President Alejandro Giammattei has been under growing pressure from the business sector to loosen restrictions. Earlier attempts to reactivate the economy were followed by a surge in infections, prompting Giammattei to clamp down again.

20-06-2020||World||UN sets up inquiry into racism after George Floyd death||The UN Human Rights Council on Friday condemned discriminatory and violent policing after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month and ordered a report on “systemic racism” against people of African descent.The 47-member-state forum unanimously adopted a resolution brought by African countries. The mandate also asks U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to examine government responses to peaceful protests, including alleged use of excessive force, and deliver findings in a year’s time.Philonise Floyd, the brother of the Black man whose death under the knee of a white officer roused world protests against racial injustice, urged the forum on Wednesday to investigate U.S. police brutality and racial discrimination.Burkina Faso’s Ambassador Dieudonné W. Désiré Sougouri presented the African resolution on Friday, urging its adoption by consensus.“It is important to show Africa...the Human Rights Council has heard the plight of African and people of African descent calling for equal treatment and application of equal rights for all,” he said.The Africa group had made numerous “concessions” in the negotiations with other countries, he added.Senegal’s envoy Coly Seck, a former council president, welcomed the consensus, telling the talks: “Black Lives Matter”.The text was watered down during closed-door negotiations from an initial draft explicitly calling for a U.N. commission of inquiry on racism in the United States and elsewhere.“It is absurd that the final resolution passed by the United Nations strips mention of the United States, where police kill people, particularly Black people, at alarmingly higher rates compared to other developed countries,” said Jamil Dakwar of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which led 600 activist groups in calling for the urgent debate.“The United Nations needs to do its job — not get bullied out of doing it — and hold the United States accountable,” he said in a statement.The Trump administration, which quit the forum two years ago alleging bias against its ally Israel, made no immediate comment. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva Andrew Bremberg said on Wednesday that his country was “not above scrutiny” as it grappled with racial discrimination but was implementing police reforms after Floyd’s killing.During the debate, Western delegations including Australia, Germany, Italy, Poland and the European Union said that the United States should not be singled out.“This problem does not belong to any one country, it is a problem around the world,” said Australian ambassador Sally Mansfield.Activists said that Australia had been particularly active in negotiations to take the spotlight off the United States.Germany’s ambassador Michael Ungern-Sternberg said: “We are convinced a report with a broader approach and less focus on one specific case would have been more appropriate”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-sets-up-inquiry-into-racism-after-george-floyd-death/story-WdCiIGNgfYCxe4chaCtoEK.html

20-06-2020||World||US calls China ‘rogue state’, cites border attack||In a hard hitting speech, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday attacked China for its “rogue” attitude in its neighbourhood, specifically mentioning its recent border attacks against India. “The PLA (People’s Liberation Army) has escalated border tensions with India, the world’s most populous democracy. It’s militarising the South China Sea and illegally claiming more territory there, threatening vital sea lanes,” Pompeo said during an online conference on democracy in Copenhagen, Denmark. During questions he said democracies and freedom-loving peoples of the world needed to come together to tackle China. Pompeo was careful to focus his criticism on the Chinese Communist Party but unusually cited Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, by name. “General Secretary Xi Jinping has green-lighted a brutal campaign of repression against Chinese Muslims, a human rights violation on a scale we haven’t seen since World War II. Now, the PLA has escalated border tensions with India,” he said.Pompeo spoke a day after he expressed deep condolences to India on the death of 20 soldiers in violent clashes with Chinese troops at Galwan Valley in Ladakh on June 15. Pompeo said China was responsible for “pushing disinformation and malicious cyber campaigns so as to drive a wedge between the US and Europe.” The Chinese Communist Party wants to undo the progress the free world has made and adopt a new set of rules and norms that accommodate Beijing. He claimed Beijing had “lied about the coronavirus and let it spread to the rest of the world, while pressuring the WHO to assist its cover-up campaign. Hundreds of thousands of people have died, and the global economy has been decimated.” China continues to refuse to provide medical information or allow outside scientists. Pompeo, who recently met Chinese Politburo member Yang Jiechi in Hawaii, said much of his conversation was about “the fundamental idea that we’re just watching [their] actions. It’s no longer enough to listen to what the Chinese Communist Party is saying. We can see their actions.” He ticked off a number of them, “Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, what they’re doing in India, what they’ve done in the economic zones along the Philippines and Malaysia and Indonesia and Vietnam, the coercion on Australia.” The US minister warned that “China’s objective is in fact to single out and indeed to threaten to single out more directly” individual countries. He called for a collective response from the world’s major countries to what Beijing was doing. “America is engaging in a response to Chinese Communist Party and aggression in a way that America has not done for the past 20 years” and said this was now a bipartisan position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-china-rogue-state-cites-border-attack/story-3NkKvxgtpaS6j19D8mm07J.html
20-06-2020||World||White House preps for ‘Salute to America’ celebration on July 4 amid Covid-19 concerns||President Donald Trump is moving ahead with a lower-key “Salute to America” celebration this year on July Fourth, despite concerns from some lawmakers about the crowds the event could generate during the coronavirus pandemic.Washington has held an Independence Day celebration for decades, featuring a parade along Constitution Avenue, a concert on the Capitol lawn with music by the National Symphony Orchestra and fireworks beginning at dusk near the Washington Monument.Trump altered the lineup last year by adding his speech, moving the fireworks closer to the Lincoln Memorial and summoning an array of tanks and warplanes to entertain the crowds.The White House said that the president and first lady Melania Trump will host the event this year from the White House’s South Lawn and the Ellipse. It said the president will deliver remarks and that the ceremony will include music, military demonstrations and flyovers. Last year, Trump spoke near the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.“As President Trump has said, there will be an Independence Day celebration this year and it will have a different look than 2019 to ensure the health and safety of those attending,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. “The American people have shown tremendous courage and spirit in the fight against this global pandemic just as our forefathers did in the fight to secure our independence, and both deserve celebration on America’s birthday this year.” Democratic lawmakers from the Washington region have stated their strong opposition to an event like last year’s.“Given the current COVID-19 crisis, we believe such an event would needlessly risk the health and safety of thousands of Americans. Further, this event would come at the cost of millions of taxpayer dollars while we are facing an unprecedented economic downturn due to the pandemic,” the lawmakers said in a May 26 letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt.One of the lawmakers who signed the letter, Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said after Friday’s announcement from the White House that the president should be capable of celebrating Independence Day responsibly.“Instead he is using the military to stage yet another costly political photo op,” Beyer asserted.The crowds on the National Mall are expected to be smaller, in part because one of the biggest draws of the day, the annual parade, has been cancelled. The parade is co-hosted by the National Park Service and a website for the event said local leadership projected that Covid-19 infection levels will not be abated to the degree that it would be safe or prudent to conduct the parade.The annual fireworks show will go on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-preps-for-salute-to-america-celebration-on-july-4-amid-covid-19-concerns/story-dWQMpVBUS2q8LSB1UlKeFL.html

20-06-2020||World||Germany, France, UK press Iran to provide atomic site access||The board of the United Nations’ atomic watchdog agency on Friday adopted a resolution calling for Iran to provide inspectors access to sites where the country is thought to have stored or used undeclared nuclear material, the Russian representative said. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, tweeted that his country and China had voted against the resolution that Germany, France and Britain proposed at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency board. “We believe that the resolution can be counterproductive,” Ulyanov said, while also “stressing the need for Tehran and IAEA to settle this problem without delay.” Earlier this week, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi reiterated concerns that for more than four months Iran had denied his inspectors access to two locations “ to clarify our questions related to possible undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities.” Activities at the sites are thought to have been from the early 2000s, before Iran signed the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Iran maintains the International Atomic Energy Agency has no legal basis to inspect them. The agency has said that Iran continues to provide access to sites covered by the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.Iran’s representative to the IAEA, Kazem Gharibabadi, said his country rejected the resolution. “We do not consider this resolution acceptable at all,” he said. “This resolution cannot create any legal obligation for the Islamic Republic of Iran in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency to grant the two accesses.” Since the United States withdrew unilaterally from the deal in 2018, the other signatories — Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China — have been struggling to save it. Meanwhile, Iran has been violating its restrictions, including the amount of uranium it can enrich and the purity of enrichment, to try to pressure those countries to provide additional economic relief to offset American sanctions. It is not clear what effect the new resolution will have on the JCPOA, but Iran threatened unspecified consequences. “The Islamic Republic of Iran will take appropriate action and respond to this resolution,” Gharibabadi said. Iran’s foreign ministry described the resolution as an “unconstructive, irresponsible and unacceptable action,” the state-run IRNA news agency reported. Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi accused Britain, France and Germany of creating tension between Iran and the IAEA and trying to avoid “their responsibilities based on the nuclear deal.” In a tweet, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif urged the three nations to “muster the courage to state publicly what they admit privately: their failure to fulfill even own JCPOA duties due to total impotence in resisting US bullying.” China’s ambassador to international organizations, Wang Qun, told board members he was “deeply concerned” about both Grossi’s decision to openly express concerns about being denied access and the resolution that was passed. He said, according to a copy of his statement provided to The Associated Press, that it could “set forth a process, under the current circumstances, that may bring the Iranian nuclear issue back to a crossroad full of uncertainties again.” The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain discussed Iran at a meeting in Berlin later Friday and issued a statement noting that the resolution passed with a “very strong majority.” The American representative, Jackie Wolcott, said the U.S. had supported the resolution and that the ball was now in Iran’s court. “The fact of the matter is this is entirely Iran’s decision,” she said in a conference call with reporters. “They could fix this overnight if they would just decide to comply with their obligations with the IAEA.” Germany, France and Britain in January invoked a dispute resolution mechanism designed to resolve issues with the 2015 deal or refer them to the U.N. Security Council. On Friday, their foreign ministers said that “we will seek a ministerial meeting to urge Iran to cooperate and to take stock of where we stand” in that process. If no resolution is found, the process could result in the resumption of U.N. and European Union sanctions on Iran. But the ministers warned against trying to force the reimposition of sanctions. “We firmly believe that any unilateral attempt to trigger U.N. sanctions snapback would have serious adverse consequences” in the U.N. Security Council, they said. “We would not support such a decision which would be incompatible with our current efforts to preserve the JCPOA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-france-uk-press-iran-to-provide-atomic-site-access/story-LzoFrJKqWSZ0eOa34BvH6I.html
20-06-2020||World||US attorney who oversaw cases of Donald Trump’s allies steps down||The US attorney who oversaw key prosecutions of allies of President Donald Trump and an investigation into Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is resigning from his post, officials said Friday.Geoffrey S. Berman is stepping down as the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. The office is one of the nation’s premiere districts, trying major mob cases and terror cases over the years.It was unclear why Berman was leaving his position after serving more than two years. The announcement was made late Friday and came after Barr visited New York City to meet with local police officials.But his departure comes days after allegations surfaced from former Trump national security adviser John Bolton that Trump sought to interfere in an Southern District investigation into the Turkish Halkbank in an effort to cut deals with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.The shakeup was likely to raise additional questions from congressional Democrats who have accused Barr of politicizing the Justice Department and acting more like Trump’s personal attorney than the nation’s chief law enforcement officer.“Doesn’t sound like ‘stepping down,’” said Preet Bharara, the previous permanent US attorney there, said in a tweet Friday. “Why does a president get rid of his own hand-picked US Attorney in SDNY on a Friday night, less than 5 months before the election?”Trump intends to nominate Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the post, Barr said. The US attorney in New Jersey, Craig Carpenito, will serve as the acting US attorney in Manhattan beginning on July 3, he said.The office has prosecuted a number of Trump associates, including Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who served a prison sentence for lying to Congress and campaign finance crimes, and has also been investigating Giuliani and his associates. He had recused himself from directly overseeing the Cohen investigation for reasons that were never disclosed.Berman has also overseen the prosecution of two Florida businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were associates of Giuliani and tied to the Ukraine impeachment investigation. The men were charged in October with federal campaign finance violations, including hiding the origin of a $325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump’s reelection.Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating Giuliani’s business dealings, including whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the probe. The people were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.Bolton’s tell-all, excerpts of which were posted by the news media this week, included details on how Trump sought to cut a deal to halt SDNY’s investigation into whether Halkbank violated US sanctions against Iran in order to free an American pastor imprisoned in Turkey. Six weeks after the pastor’s release, Bolton writes that on a call with Erdoğan, “Trump then told Erdoğan he would take care of things, explaining that the Southern District prosecutors were not his people, but were Obama people, a problem that would be fixed when they were replaced by his people.” The episode occurred months after Berman assumed the role of US attorney.A Republican who contributed to the president’s election campaign, Berman worked for the same law firm as Giuliani and was put in his job by the Trump administration. But as US attorney, he won over some skeptics after he went after Trump allies.Berman was appointed by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in January 2018, months after Bharara was fired after refusing to resign along with dozens of other federal prosecutors appointed by President Barack Obama.Three months later, FBI agents raided Cohen’s offices, an act the president decried as a politically motivated witch hunt.Berman has taken a direct hand in other investigations that have angered Trump.His office subpoenaed Trump’s inaugural committee for a wide range of documents as part of an investigation into various potential crimes, including possible illegal contributions from foreigners to inaugural events.And weeks before the 2018 midterm election, Berman announced insider trading charges against an ardent Trump supporter, Republican Rep. Chris Collins. Collins, who represented western New York, has since resigned.Under Berman’s tenure, his office also brought charges against Michael Avenatti, the combative lawyer who gained fame by representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits involving Trump. Avenatti was convicted in February of trying to extort Nike after prosecutors said he threatened to use his media access to hurt Nike’s reputation and stock price unless the sportswear giant paid him up to $25 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-attorney-who-oversaw-cases-of-donald-trump-s-allies-steps-down/story-rRNKePzkxCTc3BfVIKDKII.html
20-06-2020||World||Brazil tops 1 mn Covid-19 cases, specialists say actual number may be 7 times higher||Brazil’s government confirmed on Friday that the country has risen above 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases, second only to the United States.The country’s health ministry said that the total now stood at 1,032,913, up more than 50,000 from Thursday. The ministry said the sharp increase was due to corrections of previous days’ underreported numbers.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro still downplays the risks of the virus after nearly 50,000 deaths from Covid-19 in three months, saying the impact of social isolation measures on the economy could be worse than the disease itself.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Specialists believe the actual number of cases in Brazil could be up to seven times higher than the official statistic. Johns Hopkins University says Brazil is performing an average of 14 tests per 100,000 people each day, and health experts say that number is up to 20 times less than needed to track the virus.Official data show a downward trend of the virus in Brazil’s north, including the hard-hit region of the Amazon, a plateau in cases and deaths in the countries’ biggest cities near the Atlantic coast, but a rising curve in the south.In the Brazilian countryside, which is much less prepared to handle a crisis, the pandemic is clearly growing. Many smaller cities have weaker health care systems and basic sanitation that’s insufficient to prevent contagion.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “There is a lot of regional inequality in our public health system and a shortage of professionals in the interior,” said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil’s Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. “That creates many health care deserts, with people going long distances to get attention. When they leave the hospital, the virus can go with them.” The cattle-producing state of Mato Grosso was barely touched by the virus when it hit the nation’s biggest cities in March. Sitting far from the coast, between the Bolivian border and Brazil’s capital of Brasilia, its 3.3 million residents led a mostly normal life until May. But now its people live under lockdown and meat producers have dozens of infected workers.In Tangará da Serra, a city of 103,000 people in Mato Grosso, the mayor decided Friday to forbid the sale of alcoholic drinks for two weeks as an incentive for people to stay home. Fábio Junqueira said the measure was needed after a spike in Covid-19 cases that filled 80% of the city’s 54 intensive care beds. The city has had nearly 300 cases of the disease, plus three fatalities.In Rondonópolis, only 300 miles away from Tangará da Serra and home to a thriving economy, health authorities closed the local meatpacking industry after 92 cases were confirmed there. The city of 144,000 inhabitants counted 21 deaths from the virus and more than 600 cases. The mayor has also decided to limit sales of alcoholic beverages.Even regions once considered examples of successful efforts against the virus are now struggling.Porto Alegre, home to about 1.4 million people, had success in slowing the virus’ spread over the last three months. But now its mayor is considering increasing social isolation measures after ICU occupancy in the city jumped to 80% this month.“We were already making projections for schools to come back,” Mayor Nelson Marchezan Jr. told The Associated Press. “Now the trend is to impose more restrictions.” Outside Sao Paulo city, five regions of the state’s countryside will have to close shops starting Monday due to a rise in coronavirus cases. Gov. João Doria announced the decision Friday.Dr. Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s executive director, said at a news conference that Brazil needs to increase its efforts to stop the spread of infections.“The epidemic is still quite severe in Brazil. I believe health workers are working extremely hard and under pressure to be able to deal with the number of cases that they see on a daily basis,” Ryan said. “Certainly the rise is not as exponential as it was previously, so there are some signs that the situation is stabilizing. But we’ve seen this before in other epidemics in other countries.” Margareth Dalcolmo, a clinical researcher and professor of respiratory medicine at the state-funded Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, believes the reopening in major cities and the virus traveling by road into Brazil’s heartland will keep the pressure on the country’s health system.“The risk in the interior now is very big,” she said. ”Our health system just can’t solve the most serious cases of COVID in many places of the countryside.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-tops-1-mn-covid-19-cases-specialists-say-actual-number-may-be-7-times-higher/story-B4OHHQMRWbrVzUFpKKYDVI.html
20-06-2020||World||Coronavirus: Pre-pandemic levels not until 2023, says economist as Japan cautiously reopens economy||The roller coasters are back running in Tokyo but with requests to not scream. Restaurants are offering more take-out and outdoor seating. Major retailer Uniqlo’s new “cool and dry” mask, three for 990 yen ($9), sold out Friday shortly after it was put on the shelves.Japan’s economy is opening cautiously, with social-distancing restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic.The delicate “new normal” balancing act playing out around the world is precarious but imperative for Japan, whose long stagnant economy sorely needs tourism, exports and thriving small businesses to avoid sliding deeper into recession.Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said although Japan’s coronavirus restrictions were never as strict as the lockdowns in the US, Europe and some other parts of Asia, the damage was still considerable.Japan’s economy was already hurting from a tax increase last year. Then auto exports to the US and Europe plunged when the coronavirus hit. Consumer spending is unlikely to recover quickly.“Americans may feel happy and go splurging after the lockdown is lifted. But the Japanese mind set tends to become even more cautious about spending because of uncertainties about the future,” Maruyama said.A return to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity is not expected for Japan until 2023, a year after a likely recovery in the US, he said.Although shuttered businesses are opening again, fewer seats are allowed at theaters, events and hostess and host bars. Masked clerks peer from behind plastic curtains at stores where temperatures are checked and hands disinfected at the entrance. Professional baseball is playing to empty stands.Masks, worn by many Japanese already anyway due to a near national allergy to cedar pollen, are the dress code everywhere.Japan’s exports and imports have plunged. The world’s third largest economy has contracted for two straight quarters and is already officially in recession.The Tokyo Olympics, the big symbol of hope for the economy, has been postponed until next year, costing billions of dollars to the capital, although the exact amount has not been disclosed.The government has announced 230 trillion yen ($2 trillion) in stimulus, including help for local businesses and cash handouts of 100,000 yen ($930) per adult to coax consumers into spending.With about 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths, Japan has been spared the massive fatalities that have swept Italy, Spain, the US, Brazil and Russia. But critics fear the government’s push to relax precautions is about choosing the economy over health concerns.That includes reviving moribund tourism. The government is considering reopening travel to and from countries where coronavirus cases are relatively limited and comparable to Japan’s, such as Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam and Thailand.The 1,700 visitors to Japan in May was a decrease of 99.9% from the year before, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization, and the lowest figure since the government began keeping track in 1964.In recent years Japan has attracted about 30 million visitors from abroad, mostly from South Korea and China.Travel within Japan was temporarily curtailed under a government “emergency” to curb the spread of the virus but is now encouraged. The government is giving out discount coupons to use at tourist spots.Jazz clubs and other entertainment places were already struggling and the pandemic will likely lead many people to turn to recordings and other, safer ways to enjoy music instead, said American saxophonist Marshall McDonald.“The music business, which was on life support, will never be back. Japan is risking lives opening music places now,” said McDonald, who played for years with the Count Basie Orchestra and lives half the year in Japan.Still, after being stuck at home many Japanese have been hankering to get outside and have some fun.That includes law student Yota Nakano, who shrugged off the don’t scream request at Yomiuri Land, a Tokyo amusement park that recently reopened.“Even though I couldn’t scream, I enjoyed it from the bottom of my heart,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pre-pandemic-levels-not-until-2023-says-economist-as-japan-cautiously-reopens-economy/story-vrykMuDHXdQpVRL5nmMBwK.html
20-06-2020||World||Police accountability bills stall in Minnesota Legislature||A special session of the Minnesota Legislature appeared to be in a stalemate Friday with both parties deeply divided on how far lawmakers should go toward remaking policing in the state where George Floyd was killed.The Democratic-controlled House early Friday passed an extensive package of police accountability measures wrapped into one bill. It includes elements of five more modest policing bills that the Republican-controlled Senate passed earlier in the week but would make bigger changes than what Senate Republicans have said they’ll accept.As lawmakers huddled behind closed doors, or met on the floors to pass less-contentious legislation, around 400 demonstrators held a Juneteenth rally outside the Capitol, where they chanted Floyd’s name and called for lawmakers to pass the House bill.GOP Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, of East Gull Lake, repeatedly has said that Friday was his deadline for adjournment, and that lawmakers should focus on proposals both parties can support. But Democratic leaders from both chambers urged him at a news conference to allow more time so that both sides could seek compromises on policing and other thorny issues. He postponed indefinitely his own news conference set for Friday afternoon.“We have to do something on police accountability and reform,” Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, told reporters. “The tragic murder of George Floyd on May 25th changed the entire legislative agenda. There is no way for us to look away from this injustice, and to not do the work that thousands of Minnesotans and millions of people around the world are demanding that governments take up.” Democratic Gov, Tim Walz on Thursday challenged lawmakers to put the House bill on his desk in time to sign on Juneteenth, a holiday that has long commemorated the emancipation of enslaved Blacks but turned this year into one of protest against police brutality and racism following the killing of Floyd, an African American who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes.“Today as people across the state and nation recognize and observe Juneteenth, Senate Republicans are sending a loud message by choosing to pack up and leave before we’ve finished the work that Minnesotans are expecting us to do,” Democratic Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent, of Woodbury, told reporters.”Black, Indigenous and people of color have spent years fighting for justice. We can spend a little more than a week doing the same.” Walz, who has called for making Juneteenth a state holiday, spoke Friday with musician Pharrell Williams, who tweeted that he’s asking every governor to make it a paid holiday for state employees, and that he spoke with a number of governors Friday. “Thank you for fighting for this issue. #Juneteenth is an important part of our history, and it should be recognized and remembered by our entire state each year,” Walz wrote as he retweeted Williams’ thanks.The two parties also remained divided on the main unfinished business of the 2020 regular session, a public construction borrowing package known as a bonding bill, which could potentially include money for rebuilding neighborhoods in Minneapolis and St. Paul where businesses were damaged and destroyed in the unrest that followed Floyd’s killing.Other unresolved issues included a potential tax break that could benefit businesses seeking to rebuild, and how to allocate federal coronavirus relief money to local governments from the $2.1 billion the state received under the CARES Act.If there is no agreement on the big issues, lawmakers are likely to get another chance in mid-July.Assuming Walz intends to issue another 30-day extension of the emergency powers he’s been using to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, he’s legally required to call another special session for July 12 to let lawmakers object. That’s why he called this special session. House Democrats blocked a Senate GOP attempt last week to remove the governor’s emergency authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-accountability-bills-stall-in-minnesota-legislature/story-jfmmikbtoWgxEgptbjIEdM.html
20-06-2020||World||Mail-in voting presents ‘biggest risk’ to reelection, says Trump||President Donald Trump on Friday said the growing use of mail-in ballots is the “biggest risk” to his reelection, and his chances may hinge on whether he can successfully block efforts to make voting by mail easier during the pandemic. Trump’s comments were his first casting such high stakes for his multimillion-dollar legal campaign to fight mail-in voting. It comes as several battleground states are engaged in heated fights over plans for November’s general election, and courts are settling partisan disputes over how easy it should be to vote by mail. “My biggest risk is that we don’t win lawsuits,” Trump said in an interview with Politico published Friday. “We have many lawsuits going all over. And if we don’t win those lawsuits, I think — I think it puts the election at risk.” Health officials have said voting by mail can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But Trump has made clear he believes widespread mail-in voting would benefit Democrats. He has alleged — without citing evidence — that mail voting will lead to massive fraud, and the Republican National Committee has budgeted $20 million to fight Democratic lawsuits in at least 18 states aimed at expand it. To some degree, Trump’s effort appears to be pushing against the tide. Many states, including some with GOP leaders, are moving ahead with plans that ease access to mail-in ballots. Wisconsin, a state that swung to Trump in 2016, decided this week to send absentee ballot requests to nearly all voters before November’s elections, a step already taken by Michigan, another swing state. Primary elections have seen a surge in mail-in voting that suggests voters are comfortable casting ballots remotely. Many states already have easy access — requiring no excuses. “The president and his supporters are actively fighting against vote by mail when that is somewhat of a moot point,” said Wendy Weiser of the Brennan Center for Justice. “In most of the country, voters are allowed to vote by mail and many chose to do so.” “The question isn’t whether they should be moving to vote by mail — it is happening. The question is, Are we going to be ready for that change? It is coming. It is happening.” Still, state legislatures and courts have plenty of details to fight about. The Democratic lawsuits typically seek a list of changes to state voting rules — such as allowing ballots to be collected by community groups, a practice often derided as ballot harvesting. They’re also seeking to ensure ballots postmarked as late as Election Day are counted. Arizona on Friday settled a Democratic lawsuit by agreeing to make it easier for minorities and rural residents to cast ballots remotely. The state agreed to expand the number of ballot drop boxes in rural, Latino and tribal areas and engage in an education campaign in Spanish and tribal languages about the absentee process. There are also four federal lawsuits pending in Wisconsin, a state that Trump won by fewer than 73,000 votes in 2016. The state’s bipartisan elections commission voted this week to send absentee ballot requests to 80% of voters ahead of November, after a chaotic April election. In Michigan, the state’s Democratic secretary of state has already sent absentee ballot requests to all voters before November. Trump slammed Michigan’s move, and his party has taken notice. In Iowa, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a bill to prevent that state’s secretary of state, also a Republican, from sending all voters an absentee request — as he did for this month’s primary — without approval of a legislative committee. The legislature also passed a bill making it harder for county elections officials to correct minor errors on mail ballots. It’s unclear whether the state’s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, will sign the bills. In California, in response to GOP litigation challenging Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s decision to send every voter a mail ballot, the Democratic-controlled state legislature is formally approving that program. “Expanding vote-by-mail statewide is a necessity to protect our right to vote and our public health,” California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said. In states with divided government, the action has been less dramatic. In North Carolina, a compromise bill passed the GOP-controlled legislature last week that would reduce from two to one the number of witnesses required to sign a voter’s request for a mail ballot. The legislation, signed by Democratic Gov. Rory Cooper, also allows voters to request absentee ballots online or via fax. Georgia’s Republican secretary of state’s office is also developing an online system where voters can request absentee ballots as it opts not to send out absentee ballot applications ahead of the November election after doing so for the state’s primary, prompting criticism from Democrats. State election officials said the high cost of sending applications during the primary to 6.9 million registered voters plus the massive workload it triggered for local election offices caused them to rethink their plan for November. “We are not scaling back our efforts,” said Gabe Sterling, a top official in the Georgia secretary of state’s office. “We are refining our efforts so it can actually be successful with the resources we have available to us.” Democrats in Congress are pushing to send $3.6 billion to states to help them revamp voting systems. Republicans have yet to act on the measure, contained in a Democratic bill that includes sweeping mandates on voting procedures that are considered a nonstarter in the GOP-controlled Senate. In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order that stopped short of the demands of county election officials, who had sought a longer early voting period and flexibility in consolidating polling places to address a poll worker shortage. Instead, DeSantis’ order would close schools on Election Day so they can serve as polling locations, state employees would receive administrative leave to staff precincts and more time would be allowed to count absentee ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mail-in-voting-presents-biggest-risk-to-reelection-says-trump/story-lm3Bs6VarY0rj3gIkupgSO.html
20-06-2020||World||UK city council rules out removing Gandhi statue||The Leicester City Council on Friday ruled out the possibility of Mahatma Gandhi’s statue being removed from an arterial road in the city, days after an online petition seeking its removal with over 6,000 signatures was submitted to the council. Peter Soulsby, mayor of Leicester, gave the assurance that the statue installed on Belgrave Road in 2009 will not be removed in a letter to former Labour MP from Leicester East, Keith Vaz. The city in the east Midlands has a large population of Indian origin.Soulsby, a Labour party politician, wrote: “I well remember the pride and pleasure we enjoyed when this very prominent statue was unveiled on Belgrave Road”.“It was a matter of great pride that our City with the generous support of the donors was able to celebrate the life of Bapu who was so inspirational in the creation of modern India and such as example to the rest of the world”.“I am delighted to be able to give you an absolute assurance that there is no prospect whatsoever of the council agreeing at any time to the removal of the statue – and certainly not while I remain Mayor”, Soulsby added.The council had previously noted that it was aware of the petition and would consider it as part of wider review of statues, street names and building names in the city. The review was sparked all over the UK by the Black Lives Matter campaign against symbols of racism and slavery.According to a council spokesperson, “In such a culturally-diverse city as Leicester, it’s important that we respect the histories of all our communities and understand the context for the historical references that are part of our streetscape and built environment.”The Gandhi statue in Leicester installed with donations from charity organisation Samanwaya Pariwar is among seven across the UK: Tavistock Square, London (1968), Parliament Square, London (2015); Saughton Park, Edinburgh (1997); Museum Quarter, Hull (2004); Belgrave Road, Leicester (2009); Cardiff Bay, Cardiff (2017), and Manchester (2019).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-city-council-rules-out-removing-gandhi-statue/story-GNkvlq1FnjgiXf3EUfzdRJ.html
20-06-2020||World||Outbreak speeding up with 150k cases in a day: WHO||The coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, with Thursday’s 150,000 new cases the highest in a single day and nearly half of those in the Americas, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.“The world is in a new and dangerous phase,” Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from WHO headquarters in Geneva. “The virus is still spreading fast, it is still deadly, and most people are still susceptible.”More than 8.53 million people have been reported infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 453,834​ have died, a Reuters tally showed as of 1326 GMT on Friday.Tedros, whose leadership of the WHO has been severely criticised by U.S. President Donald Trump, urged people to maintain social distancing and “extreme vigilance.” As well as the Americas, a large number of new cases were coming from South Asia and the Middle East, Tedros added. WHO emergencies expert Mike Ryan drew attention to the situation in Brazil, where he said there had been 1,230 additional COVID-19 deaths in the previous 24 hours. About 12 percent of infections in Brazil involved healthcare workers, he added, praising their bravery. Brazil has the world’s worst outbreak outside the United States, with 978,142 confirmed cases and 47,748 deaths.“DIFFICULT JOURNEY” TO VACCINEWith many nations easing restrictions but fearful of a second wave of infections, Ryan urged a gradual and scientific approach. “Exiting lockdowns must be done carefully, in a step-wise manner, and must be driven by the data,” he said. “If don’t know where it is the chances are the virus will surprise you.”Ryan said the resurgence of new clusters did not necessarily mean a second wave, while “second peaks” were also possible in one wave. The emergencies expert praised Germany, China and South Korea for their handling of the pandemic.With trials underway around the world to find medicines and a vaccine for COVID-19, WHO officials warned that large-scale testing would be needed with side-effects carefully monitored.“Although it is not impossible to find a vaccine ... it’s going to be a very difficult journey,” Tedros said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-warns-coronavirus-pandemic-accelerating/story-qplRJfTHod7uKvZ5RjmezN.html
