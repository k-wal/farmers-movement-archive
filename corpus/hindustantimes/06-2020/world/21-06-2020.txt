Experts say first yet to get over||What’s all this talk about a “second wave” of US coronavirus cases?In The Wall Street Journal last week, Vice President Mike Pence wrote in a piece headlined “There Isn’t a Coronavirus ‘Second Wave’“ that the nation is winning the fight against the virus.Many public health experts, however, suggest it’s no time to celebrate. About 120,000 Americans have died from the new virus and there are worrisome recent increases in reported cases in the South and West.But there is at least one point of agreement: “Second wave” is probably the wrong term to describe what’s happening.“When you have 20,000-plus infections per day, how can you talk about a second wave?” said Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health. “We’re in the first wave. Let’s get out of the first wave before you have a second wave.”Clearly there was an initial infection peak in April as cases exploded in New York City. After schools and businesses were closed across the country, the rate of new cases dropped somewhat.But “it’s more of a plateau, or a mesa,” not the trough after a wave, said Caitlin Rivers, a disease researcher at Johns Hopkins University’s Center for Health Security.Scientists generally agree the nation is still in its first wave of coronavirus infections, albeit one that’s dipping in some parts of the country while rising in others.“This virus is spreading around the United States and hitting different places with different intensity at different times,” said Dr. Richard Besser, chief executive of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation who was acting director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when a pandemic flu hit the U.S. in 2009.Dr. Arnold Monto, a University of Michigan flu expert, echoed that sentiment.“What I would call this is continued transmission with flare-ups,” he said.Flu seasons sometimes feature a second wave of infections. But in those cases, the second wave is a distinct new surge in cases from a strain of flu that is different than the strain that caused earlier illnesses.That’s not the case in the coronavirus epidemic.Monto doesn’t think “second wave” really describes what’s happening now, calling it “totally semantics.”“Second waves are basically in the eye of the beholder,” he said.But Besser said semantics matter, because saying a first wave has passed may give people a false sense that the worst is over.Some worry a large wave of coronavirus might occur this fall or winter — after schools reopen, the weather turns colder and less humid, and people huddle inside more. That would follow seasonal patterns seen with flu and other respiratory viruses. And such a fall wave could be very bad, given that there’s no vaccine or experts think most Americans haven’t had the virus.But the new coronavirus so far has been spreading more episodically and sporadically than flu, and it may not follow the same playbook.“It’s very difficult to make a prediction,” Rivers said. “We don’t know the degree to which this virus is seasonal, if at all.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-second-wave-of-coronavirus-cases-experts-say-first-yet-to-get-over/story-I4Z7L6UVqx3jiO0SCCZkDI.html
21-06-2020||World||In a blow to Indians, Donald Trump says H-1B suspension coming any day now||President Donald Trump on Saturday confirmed reports of an impending suspension of non-immigrant work visas such as H-1B and L-1, which most impact Indian companies operating in the US and Indians hoping to work here, and said an announcement is expected “tomorrow or the next day”.“We’re going to be announcing something tomorrow or the next day on visas,” Trump said to a Fox News interviewer when asked about his plans to suspend these visas, which have been reported before widely, including by Hindustan Times. “And I think it’s going to make a lot of people happy. And it’s common sense, to be honest with you.”He refused to preview the details of the order, but linked it to the state of the economy struggling with record unemployment numbers caused by the lockdown of large parts of the US to fight off the coronavirus epidemic.“We have plenty of people looking for jobs,” he said.Asked if there will be exclusions, or exemptions, the president said there will be some to protect the flow of workers for big businesses”. He did not specify.President Trump had suspended most categories of immigration, in April, exempting relatives of US citizens and healthcare professional, to “ensure that unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens”. Non-immigrants visas were spared at the time, but they are due any day now.The United States grants 85,000 H-1B short-term work visas to highly skilled foreign professional every year. More than 70% go to Indians hired either from among those enrolled here for higher studies or those brought from India. They are recruited both by US companies such as Google, Facebook and Microsoft and Indian IT services majors TCS, Infosys and Wipro.And L-1 visas are used for intra-company transfers.These visas, specially H-1Bs, have been in the crosshairs of the Trump administration for a long time, going way beyond the unemployment crisis brought on by the Covid-19 virus outbreak. Increased scrutiny, tighter rules and qualification standards started just weeks after Trump took office; with the issuance of the April 18, 2017 executive order rolling out his “Buy American,” Hire American” vision.Rejection rates of H-1B visas have been going up steadily since, as has been increased demands for additional information that that make the programme prohibitively tiresome and expensive, companies have said, by piling up the paperwork and costs. Many Indian companies have recalibrated their business models and ramped up local hiring.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-blow-to-indians-donald-trump-says-h-1b-suspension-coming-any-day-now/story-g6ox7fm7KnatF4frYuQesO.html

The square reopened to the public a month ago and Italy’s last travel restrictions were lifted on June 3.“The lockdown has reduced pollution and revealed once more the beauty of so many places free from traffic and noise. Now, with the resumption of activities, we should all be more responsible for looking after our common home,” he said, using his term for the Earth.Air and water pollution levels plummeted in many places.In Venice, the usually dark waters of the city’s canals were so clean because of reduced boat traffic that fish could be seen for the first time in many years.Dolphins swam closer to ports, racoons emerged in New York’s Central Park and mountain goats roamed streets in Wales.In some cities, such as Milan, pollution reduction spurred officials to plan more pedestrian islands and cycling paths.The Roman Catholic Church is currently marking the fifth anniversary of Francis’ landmark encyclical “Laudato Si” (Praised Be) on the need to protect nature.In a 225-page manual released on Thursday, the Vatican said Catholics should disinvest from fossil fuel industries and closely monitor companies in sectors such as mining to check if they are damaging the environment.Francis, speaking a day after the United Nations World Refugee Day, also said the coronavirus crisis has highlighted the need to ensure protection for refugees because they had become more vulnerable to exploitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-says-coronavirus-should-spark-new-environmental-awareness/story-JAb3Dsc5LIBK4QoMlnY3OI.html

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “appalled and sickened” by the incident. The UK’s terrorism threat level was lowered in November 2019 from ‘severe’ to ‘substantial’, which means an attack is likely.The attack took place on Saturday night in the Forbury Gardens in central Reading, which is about 65 km west of London. Witnesses said the park at the time was full of people, when the man walked through, shouted something and slashed at people.Neil Basu, the head of counter terrorism policing at Scotland Yard, said: “From our inquiries so far, officers have found nothing to suggest that there was anyone else involved in this attack and presently we are not looking for anyone else in relation to this incident.”He added: “Although the motivation for this horrific act is far from certain counter terrorism policing have taken responsibility for leading the investigation.”The local Thames Valley police sought video footage of the incident from the public, and urged people not circulate them on social media.Chief constable John Campbell: “I am deeply saddened by the events of last night. This was a truly tragic incident and the thoughts of Thames Valley Police are with all those who have been affected”.“Incidents of this nature are very rare, though I know that will be of little comfort to those involved and understand the concern that this incident will have caused amongst our local community”.“I would urge the public to avoid the area at this time and thank the community for their patience. We will let you know as soon as the area is back open. I would also ask that the public avoid speculation”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-people-stabbed-to-death-in-terror-attack-in-uk-town/story-1qh9HynE6BpdLfrmHVgrmN.html

Multinational PepsiCo suspended its operations in Beijing after confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported in the company, state media reported.All of PepsiCo’s 87 close contacts of a confirmed case in Beijing have been quarantined, and samples taken inside and outside its Beijing plant have come out negative.Officials have said around 2.3 million people have been tested in an effort to contain the outbreak in the capital that led to the closure of its biggest wholesale food market, Xinfadi, in the southwest district of Fengtai.China, where the outbreak began in December, had eased controls on travel and business as new cases fell.But monitoring and some other restrictions have been reimposed in some of the districts in Beijing where Covid-19 cases were detected.Tourist spots continue to be closed in the city over the weekend.The agency in charge of the Ming Tombs, a tourist site northwest of Beijing, said indoor areas will be closed as a safety precaution. Visitors are allowed in outdoor areas but are required to wear masks and be checked for feverBeijing health authorities are still investigating the source of the infection with preliminary sequencing of virus samples indicating a European strain.How it has spread, however, is still not clear.Emergence of Beijing’s Covid-19 cases are not considered a second wave, but a sudden outbreak within a small area, which is currently controllable, Chinese infectious disease expert Zhang Wenhong has said.A second wave, he explained, would have an obvious crest then descend after spreading for a while.“We hope that the domestic epidemic situation can (pursue) a strategy of close to zero cases, rather than absolute zero cases,” Zhang told state media.Zhang said he believes that the situation of “true zero cases” would be difficult to achieve in the current global epidemic situation.In Zhang’s view, there may be similar situations in other cities in China in the future, and unexpected outbreaks or small-scale outbreaks may occur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-hit-beijing-sees-227-cases-experts-say-outbreaks-possible-in-other-cities/story-HD1zXK1tojKgPl3d4GO5FL.html
21-06-2020||World||China may enact Hong Kong security law at end of June||China’s top lawmaking body has announced a three-day session for the end of this month, a move that raises the possibility of the enactment of a national security law for Hong Kong that has stirred debate and fears in the semi-autonomous territory.The official Xinhua News Agency said Sunday that the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress would meet from June 28 to 30 in Beijing.The brief report did not mention the Hong Kong security law among several possible discussion items, but it could still be on the agenda or added at the meeting.China released some details of the legislation late Saturday, heightening fears that the central government is tightening its grip on Hong Kong after months of anti-government protests last year.Under the draft, the central government would set up a national security office in Hong Kong that would collect and analyze intelligence and deal with criminal cases related to national security.Hong Kong police and courts would maintain jurisdiction over cases, but the law would allow an exception for Chinese authorities to exercise jurisdiction over “a tiny number of criminal cases ... under specific circumstances,” according to a Xinhua report.It did not provide any details on what those circumstances might be.The stationing of Chinese security officials in Hong Kong and their involvement in law enforcement would arguably be the most significant erosion to date of Hong Kong’s autonomy in local affairs under the “one country, two systems” principle that has guided the city since Britain returned the former colony to China in 1997.The draft says the new security law would prevail if local Hong Kong laws are inconsistent with it, Xinhua said. It would require the Hong Kong government to create a national security commission supervised by the central government. Beijing would also appoint a national security adviser for the city.The timing of the upcoming legislative session is unusual, coming just one week after a three-day meeting that ended Saturday, and suggests that China may be aiming to pass the law ahead of a July 1 holiday that marks Hong Kong’s return to China. The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress typically meets every two months.Last year, anti-government protesters smashed their way into the locked Hong Kong legislative complex on the anniversary, spray painting slogans on the walls and damaging the electronic voting system. The months of protests, in which Chinese flags were trampled on and the Chinese emblem on its Hong Kong office defaced, prompted the central government’s decision to enact the law.Hong Kong’s leader, Carrie Lam, called the draft law “a significant initiative ... at a critical moment” to ensure the long-term prosperity and stability of the city of 7.5 million people.The law will criminalize four acts: secession, subversion of state power, terrorist activities and colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security.“It will only target an extremely small minority of people who have breached the law” on those offenses, Lam said in a statement Saturday night, adding that “the life and property, basic rights and freedoms of the overwhelming majority of Hong Kong residents will be protected.”There had been speculation that the law would be enacted at the meeting that ended Saturday, but instead only partial details of the legislation were released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-may-enact-hong-kong-security-law-at-end-of-june/story-FOTp4wIgDMmLeOTdFK3heO.html
21-06-2020||World||Loss of smell, taste symptoms can help quarantining potential Covid-19 patients: Study||Covid-19 could be suspected when patients report severe reduction of taste and smell in the absence of nasal obstruction, according to a study which says the findings can help general physicians identify and quarantine potential infected individuals before confirmation of diagnosis. In the study, published in the journal JAMA Otolaryngology Head & Neck Surgery, scientists surveyed 204 Covid-19 patients and found that taste reduction was present in 55 per cent of them, whereas smell reduction was observed in about 41 per cent of the people. Based on the results of the survey, the researchers, including those from Humanitas University in Italy, said the reduction of taste and/or smell may be a frequent and early symptom of Covid-19. The telephone survey study investigated patients diagnosed with Covid-19 from March 5 to March 23, 2020, who were hospitalised or discharged from a medical centre. It said the patients who were unable to answer -- intubated, receiving noninvasive ventilation, or deceased, or unreachable by telephone -- were excluded from the study. “Of 359 consecutive patients, 204 fulfilled the inclusion criteria, 76 were unable to answer, 76 were unreachable by telephone, and three refused,” the scientists noted in the study. The study said 116 patients reported reduction of taste and/or smell, while 113 participants noted they had taste reduction and 85 with smell reduction. “Severe reduction of taste was present in 81 patients (39.7 per cent), and severe reduction of smell was present in 72 patients (35.3 per cent),” the scientists noted in the study. They said only 12 patients with severe taste reduction, and 12 patients with severe smell reduction reported severe nasal obstruction. The researchers said severe reduction of taste and smell was more prevalent in female patients than in male patients, and in middle aged individuals more than in young people. “Our results showed a significant difference between reduction of taste and/or smell compared with the other sinonasal manifestations,” the study noted. Citing the limitations of the study, the scientists said the symptoms were self-reported, adding that further research involving more objective assessment of the patients for loss of smell and taste sensations may help validate the current findings. From the research, they believe general practitioners may play a major role in identifying potential Covid-19 cases at an early stage when taste or smell alterations manifest, and in suggesting quarantine for such patients before confirmation or exclusion of the diagnosis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/loss-of-smell-taste-symptoms-can-help-quarantining-potential-covid-19-patients-study/story-XnRwoldFpfX6cIdQDwrGoJ.html

Minnesota began allowing bars and restaurants to reopen with limited service on June 1 after some six weeks of closure because of the coronavirus pandemic.Photographs posted to social media showed windows at the Landmark’s Uptown Theatre and another storefront shot out.Screams were audible on a live video posted to Facebook that showed the aftermath at the scene. Small crowds of people gathered, with some crouched over victims lying on the pavement before police officers on bicycles showed up to attend to them. Splatters of blood were visible on the pavement after the victims were taken to local hospitals.The area is about 3 miles (5 kilometers) west of the Minneapolis commercial area and neighbourhood hit by rioting in the wake of George Floyd’s May 25 death after being arrested by Minneapolis police.Floyd’s death has sparked a move to overhaul the Minneapolis Police Department, with a majority of City Council members pledging support for dismantling a department that many community activists have called brutal and racist. That’s prompted pushback from opponents who question how citizens will be protected from violent crime. Even the most aggressive proponents for change have acknowledged it’s many months away and they’re not sure what it will look like.Calls and emails to Minneapolis police seeking more information weren’t immediately returned. Further details weren’t immediately available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-dead-11-injured-in-minneapolis-shooting/story-VcQS246F8yYXmp8HeFz1zM.html

IMBCAMS began on Saturday a phase 2 human test for its experimental shot, which is among six possible vaccines Chinese scientists are testing in humans, following an on-going phase-1 study that has recruited about 200 participants since May, the institute said on Sunday in its social media channel. The phase-2 trial will determine the shot’s dose and continue to evaluate whether the potential vaccine can safely trigger immune responses in healthy people.IMBCAMS said it expects to use a plant dedicated to producing a coronavirus vaccine this year to prepare for China’s future vaccine supplies.As early as by the end of 2020, certain groups of people with special needs can use experimental vaccines under urgent circumstances, Gao Fu, director at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said last month.The coronavirus, which was first detected in China late in 2019, has infected 8.81 million people globally and killed more than 460,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-researchers-launch-phase-2-human-test-for-possible-coronavirus-vaccine/story-hYBfBlgVbu40WIWzoFqbyI.html
21-06-2020||World||Donald Trump says he will announce visa restrictions in few days: Report||President Donald Trump said on Saturday he would announce new restrictions on visas within a couple of days to block the entry of certain foreign workers and protect Americans struggling with a job market devastated by the coronavirus pandemic.“We’re going to be announcing something tomorrow or the next day on the visas,” he told Fox News Channel.Asked if there would be exclusions from the new restrictions, Trump said very few.“You need them for big businesses where they have certain people that have been coming in for a long time, but very little exclusion and they’re pretty tight,” he said. “And we may even go very tight for a period of time.”Trump, who has been expected to announce new restrictions, declined to provide further details.Critics have said Trump looked set to use the pandemic to achieve his longstanding goal of limiting immigration into the United States. His tough stance on immigration is central to his pitch to voters as he runs for re-election.Major American companies, particularly in the tech sector, have urged Trump to refrain from blocking the flow of foreign workers into the United States, saying it would hurt the economy.The new action would be Trump’s latest step to restrict immigration in response to the pandemic and economic fallout. In April, he ordered a temporary block on some foreigners from permanent residence in the United States.He also announced new health-focused rules in March that allow for the rapid deportation of immigrants caught at the border and virtually cut off access to the U.S. asylum system. At the same time, he announced the land borders with Canada and Mexico would be closed to non-essential crossings, a measure that has been extended several times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-says-he-will-announce-visa-restrictions-in-few-days-report/story-VOD5pxDwkNkyPFVZSBVnSI.html
21-06-2020||World||Australian state extends state of emergency as coronavirus cases spike||Australia’s second most populous state Victoria on Sunday extended its state of emergency for four more weeks to July 19, as it battles a spike in coronavirus infections with a pick-up in community transmission.The move came a day after the state announced it would reimpose restrictions capping visitors to households to five people and outdoor gatherings to 10, starting Monday. The limits had been relaxed on June 1 to allow up to 20 people in households and public gatherings.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageVictoria reported 19 new infections on Sunday, the fifth day of double digit-rises. The state has now had 1,836 total confirmed cases, or a quarter of the cases in Australia, since the Covid-19 pandemic erupted.Sunday’s tally in Victoria included an Australia Rules football player, the first in the league to test positive, whose team and coaching staff have been told to isolate.The surge in Victoria has alarmed other states, which have had only a few, if any, new cases for several weeks. Western Australia, which shut its borders in April, said it would weigh Victoria’s situation in determining when to reopen its borders.Australian health officials, however, still see no need to require use of face masks, as they would have limited value in a country where absolute numbers of community transmission remain “very low”, deputy chief medical officer Nick Coatsworth said.Avoiding hugging and kissing was “arguably far more important than, say, wearing masks”, he said.Victorian state health minister Jenny Mikakos said 210 of the state’s cases are believed tied to community transmission, partly blaming families who have had parties, lunches and dinners attended by people with mild symptoms since restrictions were eased on June 1.“We obviously have been concerned by the increasing numbers that we have seen in recent days. It is still a very serious situation,” Mikakos said at a televised media conference in Melbourne.State police said they planned to step up enforcement efforts, especially in suburbs where there have been breakouts and patrolling ski resorts and camper-van parks during the upcoming school holidays.Individuals caught breaching restrictions face fines of up to A$1,652 ($1,129) for individuals and A$9,913 for businesses.“This is not the time to be complacent,” Victoria’s police minister, Lisa Neville, told reporters.The Australian Industry Group, which represents a wide range of employers, said Victoria’s tightening of restrictions again, including extending working from home through to the end of July, would make it harder for businesses to reopen later.“The economic impact unfortunately will be hard and harsh,” Ai Group chief executive Innes Willox said.

21-06-2020||World||‘Ring of fire’ solar eclipse to dim Africa, Asia||Skywatchers along a narrow band from west Africa to the Arabian Peninsula, India and southern China will witness on Sunday a dramatic “ring of fire” solar eclipse.So-called annular eclipses occur when the Moon -- passing between Earth and the Sun -- is not quite close enough to our planet to completely obscure sunlight, leaving a thin ring of the solar disc visible.They happen every year or two, and can only been seen from a narrow pathway across the planet.Were the Moon just a wee bit closer -- 379,100 rather than 381,500 kilometres away -- Earthlings would be treated to a total blackout, visible at a given spot on our planet about every 400 years.Remarkably, the eclipse Sunday arrives on the northern hemisphere’s longest day of the year -- the summer solstice -- when Earth’s north pole is tilted most directly towards the Sun.The “ring of fire” will first be seen in northeastern Republic of Congo at 5:56 local time (04:56 GMT) just a few minutes after sunrise. This is the point of maximum duration, with the blackout lasting 1 minute and 22 seconds.Arcing eastward across Africa and Asia, it will reach “maximum eclipse” -- with a perfect solar halo around the Moon -- over Uttarakhand, India near the Sino-Indian border at 12:10 local time (6:40 GMT).More spectacular, but less long-lived: the exact alignment of the Earth, Moon and Sun will be visible for only 38 seconds. “The annular eclipse is visible from about two percent of Earth surface,” Florent Delefie, an astronomer and the Paris Observatory, told AFP.“It’s a bit like switching from a 500-watt to a 30-watt light bulb,” he added. “It’s a cold light, and you don’t see as well.”- Good weather key -Animals can get spooked -- birds will sometimes go back to sleep, and cows will return to the barn.The full eclipse will be visible at successive locations over a period of nearly four hours, and one of the last places to see a partially hidden Sun is Taiwan before.People hundreds of kilometres on either side of the centreline across 14 countries will also see light drain from the day, but not the “ring of fire”.Weather conditions are critical for viewing.“Good weather is the key to successful eclipse viewing,” astrophysicist Fred Espenak, an expert on eclipse prediction, commented on the NASA Eclipse website. “Better to see a shorter eclipse from clear sky than a longer eclipse under clouds.”A solar eclipse always occurs about two weeks before or after a lunar eclipse, when the Moon moves into Earth’s shadow. Lunar eclipses are visible from about half of Earth’s surface.There will be a second solar eclipse in 2020 on December 14 over South America. Because the Moon will be a bit closer to Earth, it will block on the Sun’s light entirely. Even if the day has darkened, looking at a solar eclipse with the naked eye is dangerous. Sunglasses -- which don’t filter out UV rays -- do not offer any protection, Delefie warned.“The Sun is so bright that even when there’s only a tiny portion visible, it is still dangerous for the eyes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ring-of-fire-solar-eclipse-to-dim-africa-asia/story-79bgY8gJGrp6VywcCOgpJN.html

Seventy other cases were linked to a table tennis club in another part of Seoul, where members also passed the virus at a church.Health authorities earlier found hundreds of cases linked to nightspots, e-commerce workers and church gatherings.While some experts say the country should reimpose stronger social distancing guidelines after easing them in mid-April, officials have been reluctant to do so over concerns of hurting an already fragile economy.In other developments in the Asia-Pacific region:Chinese authorities reported 25 new confirmed cases — 22 in Beijing and three in neighbouring Hebei province. They say 2.3 million people have been tested in an effort to contain the outbreak in the capital that led to the closure of its biggest wholesale food market. China, where the outbreak began in December, had eased controls on travel and business as new cases fell. But monitoring and some other restrictions have been reimposed following the recent jump in infections. The Beijing health commission gave no details of where the latest cases might have originated. The Chinese capital’s biggest wholesale food market was closed June 13 after dozens of people who worked there tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-records-48-new-covid-19-cases-some-outside-seoul/story-XvhCWfOmySVZJ3AJzliR6L.html
21-06-2020||World||Japanese PM Shinzo Abe’s public support rises despite ex-justice minister’s arrest||Public support for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s cabinet rose by nine percentage points to 36% despite the recent arrest of his former justice minister on suspicion of vote-buying, a poll by the Mainichi Shimbun daily showed on Sunday.The approval rating had fallen to 27% in the paper’s previous survey conducted soon after a senior Tokyo prosecutor who was seen close to the premier resigned in late May for gambling during Japan’s coronavirus state of emergency.A drop in voter support below 30% is often seen as a danger sign. The Mainichi report on its latest survey does not give specific reasons for the rebound in support, but 55% of those polled welcomed the government’s decision on Thursday to lift curbs on domestic travels.That compares with 32% of those surveyed who said the restrictions should have remained in place. Prosecutors on Thursday arrested former justice minister Katsuyuki Kawai, a one-time foreign policy adviser close to Abe, and Kawai’s lawmaker wife, Anri, on suspicion of vote-buying in a 2019 upper-house election. Although support for Abe’s government rebounded, 59% of those surveyed believe Abe has heavy responsibility for the matter.Abe has apologised to the public over the scandal, saying he felt his responsibility strongly for his appointment of Kawai to the post.The Mainichi survey also showed that 59% of those polled do not believe the Tokyo Olympics, originally scheduled for July and August this year but postponed by one year due to the coronavirus pandemic, can be held next year. Only 21% believe the event can be held in 2021. Japan has not suffered the explosive surge of coronavirus infections seen in some other countries, with about 18,000 confirmed cases and 954 deaths, according to public broadcaster NHK.

21-06-2020||World||Tensions flare at protests outside Donald Trump’s rally in Tulsa||President Donald Trump’s supporters faced off with protesters shouting “Black Lives Matter” Saturday in Tulsa as the president held his first campaign rally in months amid public health concerns about the coronavirus and fears that the event could lead to violence in the wake of killings of Black people by police.Hundreds of marchers flooded the city’s downtown streets and blocked traffic at times, but police reported just one arrest as of Saturday afternoon. Many on foot chanted, and some occasionally got into shouting matches with Trump supporters, who outnumbered them and yelled, “all lives matter.” Later in the evening, a group of armed men began following the protesters. When the protesters blocked an intersection, a man wearing a Trump shirt got out of a truck and spattered them with pepper spray. Police later deployed an irritant gas to try and make the group disperse.The Trump faithful gathered inside the 19,000-seat BOK Center for what was believed to be the largest indoor event in the country since restrictions to prevent the Covid-19 virus began in March. Many of the president’s supporters weren’t wearing masks, despite the recommendation of public health officials to keep the coronavirus from spreading. Some had been camped near the venue since early in the week.Turnout at the rally was lower than the campaign predicted, with a large swath of standing room on the stadium floor and empty seats in the balconies. Trump had been scheduled to appear at a rally outside of the stadium within a perimeter of tall metal barriers, but that event was abruptly cancelled.Trump campaign officials said protesters prevented the president’s supporters from entering the stadium. Three Associated Press journalists reporting in Tulsa for several hours leading up to the president’s speaking did not see protesters block entry to the area where the rally was held.While Trump spoke onstage, protesters carried a paper machete representation of him with pig snout. Some in the multiracial group wore Black Lives Matter shirts, others sported rainbow-colored armbands, and many covered their mouths and noses with masks. At one point, several people stopped to dance to gospel singer Kirk Franklin’s song “Revolution.” The protesters blocked traffic in at least one intersection. Some Black leaders in Tulsa have said they’re worried the visit could lead to violence. It’s happening amid protests over racial injustice and policing across the U.S. and in a city that has a long history of racial tension. Officials said they expected some 100,000 people in Tulsa’s downtown.The woman who was arrested was seen on live video sitting cross-legged on the ground in peaceful protest when officers pulled her away by the arms and later put her in handcuffs. She said her name was Sheila Buck and that she was from Tulsa.Police said in a news release the officers tried for several minutes to talk Buck into leaving and that she was taken into custody for obstruction after police were asked by the Trump campaign to remove her from the area.Buck was wearing a T-shirt that said “I Can’t Breathe” — the dying words of George Floyd, whose death has inspired a global push for racial justice. She she had a ticket to the Trump rally and was told she was being arrested for trespassing. She said she was not part of any organized group.Several blocks away from the BOK Center was a festival-like atmosphere, with food vendors serving hot dogs and cold drinks and sidewalks lined with people selling various Trump regalia.There was also an undercurrent of tension near the entrance to the secured area, where Trump supporters and opponents squared off. Several downtown businesses boarded up their windows as well to avoid any potential damage.Kieran Mullen, 60, a college professor from Norman, Oklahoma, held a sign that read, “Black Lives Matter” and “Dump Trump.” “I just thought it was important for people to see there are Oklahomans that have a different point of view,” Mullen said of his state, which overwhelmingly supported Trump in 2016.Brian Bernard, 54, a retired information technology worker from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, sported a Trump 2020 hat as he took a break from riding his bicycle around downtown Tulsa. Next to him was a woman selling Trump T-shirts and hats, flying a “Keep America Great Again” flag. Her shirt said, “Impeach this,” with an image of Trump extending his middle fingers.“Since the media won’t do it, it’s up to us to show our support,” said Bernard, who drove nine hours to Tulsa for his second Trump rally.Bernard said he wasn’t concerned about catching the coronavirus at the event and doesn’t believe it’s “anything worse than the flu.” Across the street, armed, uniformed highway patrol troopers milled about a staging area in a bank parking lot with dozens of uniformed National Guard troops.Tulsa has seen cases of Covid-19 spike in the past week, and the local health department director asked that the rally be postponed. But Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said it would be safe. The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Friday denied a request that everyone attending the indoor rally wear a mask, and few in the crowd outside Saturday were wearing them.The Trump campaign said six staff members helping prepare for the event tested positive for COVID-19. They were following “quarantine procedures” and wouldn’t attend the rally, said Tim Murtaugh, the campaign’s communications director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-flare-at-protests-outside-donald-trump-s-rally-in-tulsa/story-hgTk8HEUX2fjt5zDB5MD8L.html
21-06-2020||World||‘Covid-19 testing double-edged sword, asked my people to slow it down’ : US President Donald Trump||US President Donald Trump on Saturday told supporters at an election rally in Oklahoma’s Tulsa that he had ordered officials to slow down testing for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as it led to more cases.“You know testing is a double-edged sword,” Trump said. “When you do testing to that extent you’re going to find more cases. So I said to my people slow the testing down.”The United States has the most Covid-19 infections in the world - more than 2.25 million - and fatalities at close to 1,12,000. His own experts have recommended increased testing to get ahead of the epidemic and it was a stunning admission from the president that he had asked for it to be slowed down.The Biden campaign has slammed the president’s admission as an “an outrageous moment” saying Trump “is putting politics ahead of the safety and economic well-being of the American people”.Trump is in a hurry to reopen the country and get its economy running back again, with an eye on his re-election prospects in November. Even the rally he addressed on Saturday in Tulsa, which was meant to meant to mark his return to the campaign trail after three months, was staged amidst widespread concerns about so many people congregating in a tight place with no scope of social distancing.Just hours before the president was scheduled to take the stage, his campaign announced that six members of an advance team on ground in Tulsa had tested positive for Covid-19. But that had little or no salutary effect on the organisers or supporters. Few people wore masks, including the president and all the other speakers who preceded him. In the stands, there was no observance of social distancing norms recommended by the president’s own experts and federal agencies fighting the epidemic.The president was excited about returning to the campaign trail and the promise of a massive turnout had added to the build-up. Based on an estimated one million RSVPs, the campaign had planned an indoor rally and one outdoors for the spillover crowd. No one showed up for the outdoor event, and stands in the indoor venue had many empty seats.Evidently surprised and embarrassed, the campaign sought to blame protesters and media for the low turnout. “Radical protesters, coupled with a relentless onslaught from the media, attempted to frighten off the president’s supporters. We are proud of the thousands who stuck it out,” Tim Murtaugh, a campaign spokesman, said.Sporadic incidents of clashes were witnessed between Trump supporters and protestors, but not as widespread or of a scale as portrayed by the Trump campaign. Police used pepper balls in one instance, Tulsaworld, a local news publication, reported. One protester was also arrested.In a speech lasting almost two hours, the president slammed his presumptive Democratic rival Joe Biden, the former vice-president, who is seeking to tie him to the anti-racism protests that ripped through the country over the past weeks, marked by violence, looting and clashes with law enforcements forces.The president also reeled off a list of his administration’s achievements that read like a compilation of points covered many times in his tweets. The president spent quite a bit of time counter attacking questions raised about his health after he was seen using both hands to lift a glass a water to his lips and for shuffling off a ramp from the stage. He went on to drink from a glass using just one hand to prove his point, to cheers from his supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-testing-double-edged-sword-asked-my-people-to-slow-it-down-us-president-donald-trump/story-U8WO94L8MMfTbQCw4ZICiN.html
21-06-2020||World||‘More testing means more cases, slow it down’: Trump’s advice to Covid-19 responders||US President Donald Trump said Saturday he was encouraging coronavirus response workers to slow down testing, arguing that increased tests lead to more cases being discovered.The president has claimed falsely on several occasions that surges of Covid-19 in several states can be explained by increased diagnostic tests.At his first rally since the outbreak forced nationwide shutdowns in March, Trump told the crowd in Tulsa, Oklahoma that testing was a “double-edged sword.” The US -- which has more deaths and cases than any other country -- has carried out around 27 million coronavirus tests, placing it 26th in the world, per capita.“Here is the bad part: When you do testing to that extent, you are going to find more people, you will find more cases,” Trump argued. “So I said ‘slow the testing down.’ They test and they test.”It was not clear from Trump’s tone if he was playing to the crowd, which cheered as he spoke, or if he was being serious.Coronavirus cases have spiked in several states, including Oklahoma, and local health officials had asked Trump to postpone the rally, fearing it would contribute to the spread. Six members of an advance team working in Tulsa ahead of the rally tested positive for Covid-19, the Trump campaign said just hours before the president took the stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-admits-urging-covid-19-responders-to-slow-testing/story-exCqwLxFaSSBZiq3jY3GnO.html
21-06-2020||World||Top Manhattan prosecutor Berman leaves job after standoff with Barr||An extraordinary standoff between the Justice Department and Manhattan US Attorney Geoffrey S. Berman ended Saturday when the prosecutor agreed to leave his job with an assurance that his investigations into allies of President Donald Trump would not be disturbed.The announcement capped two days of conflicting statements, allegations of political interference in prosecutions, and defiance from Berman. On Saturday, Attorney General William Barr said Berman’s refusal to resign under pressure prompted Trump to fire him. Trump tried to distance himself from the dispute, telling reporters the decision “was all up to the attorney general.”This episode deepened tensions between the Justice Department and congressional Democrats, who have accused Barr of politicizing the agency and acting more like Trump’s personal lawyer than the country’s chief law enforcement officer. It also raised questions about ongoing investigations in the Southern District of New York, most notably a probe into Rudy Giuliani, the president’s personal attorney.Barr set off the whirlwind chain of events on Friday night with a surprise announcement that Berman was resigning, without explanation. But Berman insisted he had not resigned, was not stepping down and his investigations would continue.On Saturday morning, he showed up to work, telling reporters, “I’m just here to do my job.”Hours later, Barr announced Berman’s firing.“Unfortunately, with your statement of last night, you have chosen public spectacle over public service,” Barr wrote in a letter released by the Justice Department. He said the idea that Berman had to continue on the job to safeguard investigations was “false.”Although Barr said Trump had removed Berman, the president told reporters: “That’s all up to the attorney general. Attorney General Barr is working on that. That’s his department, not my department.” Trump added: “I wasn’t involved.”The administration’s push to cast aside Berman amounted to a political and constitutional clash between the Justice Department and one of the nation’s top districts, which has tried major mob, financial crimes and terrorism cases over the years.Only days ago, allegations surfaced from former Trump national security adviser John Bolton that the president sought to interfere in an investigation by Berman’s office into the state-owned Turkish bank in an effort to cut deals with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.Berman initially vowed to stay on the job until a replacement was confirmed. He changed his mind late Saturday after Barr said he would allow Berman’s second in command, Deputy US Attorney Audrey Strauss, to become acting US attorney.Berman said Strauss’ appointment signaled that Barr had decided “to respect the normal operation of law.” He said he was stepping down immediately.The administration’s efforts to replace Berman with a handpicked replacement, however, were already running into roadblocks before Barr agreed to install Strauss.After announcing Berman’s resignation, the White House said it was nominating Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Jay Clayton, a well-connected Wall Street lawyer with virtually no experience as a federal prosecutor, for the job.But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee and a close Trump ally, said he was unlikely to proceed with Clayton’s nomination unless New York’s senators, Democrats Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, gave their consent to the pick.Schumer said the bid to oust Berman “reeks of potential corruption of the legal process,” and Gillibrand said she would “not be complicit” in helping fire a prosecutor investigating corruption. Both lawmakers called for Clayton to withdraw from consideration.Schumer also called for the department’s inspector general and Office of Professional Responsibility to investigate Berman’s ouster. And the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Rep. Jerry Nadler, D-N.Y., said Berman has an open invitation to testify before his panel.Berman, a Republican who contributed to the president’s election campaign, worked for the same law firm as Giuliani and was personally interviewed by Trump before being tapped as US attorney. But he won over some skeptics after overseeing numerous prosecutions and investigations with ties to Trump.Though Berman is said to be unclear about the exact reason he was fired, people familiar with his thinking said his job had always seemed in jeopardy and he never had the sense it was secure.Among the most high profile investigations he was overseeing was into Giuliani’s business dealings, including whether he failed to register as a foreign agent. Charges in the case do not appear imminent, according to people familiar with the matter. They were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.The Southern District has also prosecuted a number of Trump associates, including Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who served a prison sentence for lying to Congress and campaign finance crimes. Cohen was recently released from a federal prison to continue serving his sentence on home confinement over coronavirus concerns.Berman has overseen the prosecution of two Florida businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were associates of Giuliani and tied to the Ukraine impeachment investigation. The men were charged in October with federal campaign finance violations, including hiding the origin of a $325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump’s reelection.Under Berman’s tenure, his office also brought charges against Michael Avenatti, the combative lawyer who gained fame by representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits involving Trump. Avenatti was convicted in February of trying to extort Nike after prosecutors said he threatened to use his media access to hurt Nike’s reputation and stock price unless the sportswear giant paid him up to $25 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-manhattan-prosecutor-berman-leaves-job-after-standoff-with-barr/story-jvzCcQUREfGKxD7Ycd0zMO.html
21-06-2020||World||North Korea vows to send anti-South leaflets amid tensions||North Korea pledged to push ahead with its campaign to send propaganda leaflets into South Korea, saying it is not bound to any inter-Korean agreements, state media said on Sunday.Tension has been rising after North Korea blew up a joint liaison office and threatened military action over defectors in the South sending anti-North leaflets across the border.As state media reported angry North Koreans gearing up for their own “large-scale” leaflet campaign, Seoul’s Unification Ministry handling cross-border affairs on Saturday urged the plan to be scrapped citing a violation of peace agreements.The United Front Department of the North’s ruling party, in charge of inter-Korean affairs, rejected the ministry’s calls as an “absurd nonsense.”“Given their own wrongdoings, how dare they utter such words as regret and violation?” the department’s spokesman said in a statement carried by state media KCNA.“When they are put in our shoes, the South Korean authorities will be able to understand even a bit how disgustedly we looked at them and how offending it was for us.”The two Koreas, which are still technically at war as their 1950-53 conflict ended without a peace treaty, have waged leaflet campaigns for decades but agreed to cease “all hostile acts” in a 2018 peace accord.Several defector-led groups have regularly sent back flyers, together with food, $1 bills, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean dramas and news, usually by balloon over the border or in bottles in rivers.One of the groups dropped a plan to float hundreds of plastic bottles stuffed with rice, medicine and face masks into the sea near the border on Sunday.Pyongyang has also used balloons and drones to fly its anti-South leaflets, which in South Korea in the past have been rewarded with stationery if reported to police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-vows-to-send-anti-south-leaflets-amid-tensions/story-ho08EwycQ8QoOtYB9winLN.html
21-06-2020||World||Trump comeback rally features empty seats, staff infections||President Donald Trump pressed ahead Saturday with a comeback rally amid a pandemic by declaring “the silent majority is stronger than ever before,” but what was meant to be a show of political force was instead met with thousands of empty seats and new coronavirus cases on his campaign staff.Ignoring health warnings, Trump scheduled the rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma. It was intended to be the largest indoor gathering in the world during the outbreak that has killed more than 120,000 Americans, put 40 million more out of work and upended Trump’s reelection bid. But in the hours before the event, crowds seemed significantly lighter than expected. Campaign officials scrapped plans for Trump to first address an overflow space.Trump tried to explain away the crowd size, blaming it on the media for declaring “don’t go, don’t come, don’t do anything” while insisting there were protesters outside “doing bad things,” though the small crowds of prerally demonstrators were largely peaceful.“We begin our campaign,” Trump thundered. “The silent majority is stronger than ever before.”But huge swaths of empty seats remained in the downtown arena before Trump was to take the stage. And that came on the heels of the campaign revealing that six staff members who were helping set up for the event had tested positive for the virus. Campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said that “quarantine procedures were immediately implemented,” and that neither the affected staffers nor anyone who was in immediate contact with them would attend the event.News of the infections came just a short time before Trump departed for Oklahoma, and the president raged to aides that it was made public, according to two White House and campaign officials who spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren’t authorized to speak publicly about private conversations.Large gatherings in the United States were shut down in March because of the coronavirus. The rally was scheduled over the protests of local health officials as Covid-19 cases spike in many states, while the choice of host city and date — it was originally set for Friday, Juneteenth, only to be moved a day — prompted anger amid a national wave of protests against racial injustice.But Trump and his advisers forged forward, believing that a return to the rally stage would reenergize the president, who is furious that he has fallen behind Democrat Joe Biden in polls, and reassure Republicans growing anxious about the state of the presidential race and their ability to hold onto the Senate. But the smaller-than-expected crowds may only increase GOP worries.The president’s campaign tried to point fingers elsewhere, but the protests outside the arena, which also were smaller than expected, remain largely peaceful in the hours before the event.“Sadly, protestors interfered with supporters, even blocking access to the metal detectors, which prevented people from entering the rally,” Murtaugh said in a statement. “Radical protestors, coupled with a relentless onslaught from the media, attempted to frighten off the President’s supporters. We are proud of the thousands who stuck it out.”In the minutes before the president arrived at the downtown arena, Trump supporters who signed up for tickets received a text urging them to show up, declaring, “There’s still space!”It’s been more than three months since the nation last saw a Trump rally. The unemployment rate stood at about 3.5% that March 2. The number of coronavirus cases in the U.S. was estimated at 91.Now, the unemployment rate stands at 13.3%, based on the most recent monthly report. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases has soared to about 2.2 million. The number of deaths reported in the U.S. has surpassed 119,000. Outrage over the criminal justice system’s treatment of minorities following the death of George Floyd and other African Americans has spawned protests around the nation. Only about a quarter of Americans say the country is headed in the right direction.Trump was determined to return to his signature campaign events. He dismissed complaints that bringing together throngs for an indoor rally risked spreading the coronavirus as nothing more than politics.Trump’s visit also raised fears of clashes between protesters and Trump supporters, and there were brief confrontations Saturday afternoon. But the crowds were not materializing despite the president’s bravado.“Big crowds and lines already forming in Tulsa. My campaign hasn’t started yet. It starts on Saturday night in Oklahoma!” Trump tweeted Friday.City officials had expected a crowd of 100,000 people or more in downtown Tulsa. Trump’s campaign, for its part, declared that it had received over a million ticket requests. The crowd that gathered was far less than that, though the rally, being broadcast on cable, will also target voters in battleground states such as Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Florida.The campaign said it would hand out masks and hand sanitizer, but there was no requirement that participants use them. Participants were also to undergo a temperature check.“I don’t think it’s anything worse than the flu,” said Brian Bernard, 54, a retired IT worker from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, who sported a Trump 2020 hat. “I haven’t caught a cold or a flu in probably 15 years, and if I haven’t caught a cold or flu yet, I don’t think I’m gonna catch Covid.”Trump has generally held his campaign rallies in swing states or in Democratic-leaning states such as Colorado or New Mexico that he hopes to flip this November. Oklahoma fits none of those categories. The last Democratic candidate to emerge victorious there in a presidential election was Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Trump won the state with more than 65% of the vote in the 2016 election. The Republican stronghold gives Trump more assurance that he’ll face little resistance to his efforts from top state officials.The rally was originally scheduled for Friday, but it was moved back a day following an uproar that it otherwise would have happened on Juneteenth, and in a city where a 1921 white-on-Black attack killed as many as 300 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-comeback-rally-features-empty-seats-staff-infections/story-rhwLfCFamCslM6eyqKmvRM.html

21-06-2020||World||Serbians head to polls in Europe’s first post-lockdown election||Serbians go to polls on Sunday to elect a new parliament in Europe’s first national election since coronavirus lockdowns took effect some three months ago, with the ruling conservatives seen winning a comfortable majority.Polling stations will be equipped with face masks and hand sanitisers for the use of the country’s 5.5 million voters, many of whom are expected to skip voting - partly due to fears of becoming infected.Turnout could also be hit by the boycott campaign of some opposition parties, who say the vote will not be free or fair due to President Aleksandar Vucic’s firm grip over the media.According to the latest opinion polls, Vucic’s conservative Serbian Peoples’ Party (SNS) is set to garner about 50% of the vote, boosted by widespread public approval over the government’s handling of the pandemic.Vucic’s coalition partner, the Socialist Party, is expected to come second with about 10%, while an opposition centre-right party led by Aleksandar Sapic, the mayor of a Belgrade municipality, is tipped to come third.Vucic himself is not up for re-election, but the opposition parties that are boycotting the poll accuse him of using his position as president to promote his party.Serbia, which has a population of 7.2 million, has so far reported 12,803 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 260 deaths. It was among the first European countries to start opening its borders on May 22 and all lockdown curbs have since been lifted.Still, persistent health concerns will keep some voters at home, especially among higher-risk groups.“A number of voters above 65 will not vote because they are afraid they could get infected,” Bojan Klacar, executive director of the CESID pollster told Reuters.Voters largely back efforts by Vucic’s ruling coalition to push for Serbian membership of the European Union while maintaining strong ties with Russia and China.But the future government will face increasing EU and U.S. pressure to recognise the independence of Serbia’s former province of Kosovo, a move seen as key for regional stability.

21-06-2020||World||6 staffers setting up for Trump rally positive for Covid-19||President Donald Trump’s campaign says six staff members helping set up for his Saturday night rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, have tested positive for coronavirus.The campaign’s communications director, Tim Murtaugh, said in a statement that “quarantine procedures” were immediately initiated and no staff member who tested positive would attend the event. He said no one who had immediate contact with those staffers would attend, either.Murtaugh said campaign staff members are tested for Covid-19 as part of the campaign’s safety protocols.Campaign officials say everyone who is attending the rally will be given temperature checks before they pass through security. They will also be given masks to wear, if they want, and hand sanitizer at the 19,000-seat BOK Center.The rally is expected to be the biggest indoor event the country has seen since restrictions to prevent the coronavirus from spreading began in March.Tulsa has seen cases of Covid-19 spike in the past week, and the local health department director asked that the rally be postponed. But Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said it would be safe. The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Friday denied a request that everyone attending the indoor rally wear a mask, and few in the crowd outside Saturday were wearing them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-staffers-setting-up-for-trump-rally-positive-for-covid-19/story-3tz7FrySBJCvXX8k1c48rJ.html
21-06-2020||World||Is Covid-19 more fatal for men than women?||While experts and scientists are ramping up effort to arrive at the potential Covid-19 vaccine, a vast body of research exists and focusses on the other aspects of the contagious disease and how it is affecting the world. Experts have now come to conclude that Covid-19 is posing a greater threat to the male population as opposed to females. More men are getting infected by the disease as opposed to women. Experts also believe that the biological differences between the two sexes should be taken into consideration for developing treatments and vaccines for Covid-19.Also read: Ramp up Covid-19 testing in containment zones, hospitals - ICMR to states“Around the world, on every continent, we’re observing that men are significantly more likely to be hospitalized with severe Covid-19, and men are also significantly more likely to die from Covid-19. Some studies are showing the risks are twofold for men. Women are contracting the virus at same rates as men, but they are more likely to recover,” noted a research entry by Johns Hopkins University, which also calls for a deeper investigation. The research points to the fact that women typically have a more rapid and robust immune response to viruses than men which “may be one factor contributing to female-biased protection against SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19”. “There are data from early outbreaks in Wuhan, China, for example, that show women clear the virus more quickly than men,” the piece reads.Also read: Glenmark launches Covid-19 drug after DCGI nodDifferences in sexes also affect immunity. “We have data for other viruses illustrating that sex differences in immunity are caused by genetic as well as hormonal differences between women and men,” it stated.Another recently conducted study says that as of May 20, 2020, males shared a higher burden (66 per cent) of Covid-19 infections than females (34 per cent) but the infection is more or less evenly distributed in under-five as well as elderly age groups.Males are at a greater disadvantage than females, they said, adding that it is unclear whether males experience a higher risk of mortality throughout the age-spectrum, or if there are sex-related differences in survival risk.“While males have a higher overall burden (66 per cent) of Covid-19 infections than females, the infection is evenly distributed in the under-five age group and, to some extent, even among the elderly age groups (particularly 70+ years),” the scientists wrote in the study which was published in the Journal of Global Health Science.Coronavirus has infected over 8 million people across the globe while over 4.6 people have lost their lives to the deadly contagion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-covid-19-more-fatal-for-men-than-women/story-165RtYcxuUqThiIGdaL8ZK.html
