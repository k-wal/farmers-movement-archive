He later went home to self-isolate and had a test for the virus, amidst growing concerns about parliament’s functioning during the pandemic.Sharma tweeted: “Huge thanks to everyone for their really kind messages over the last 24 hours and my grateful thanks also to the parliamentary authorities and Speaker for their support yesterday. Just had results in and my test for #COVIDー19 was negative”.While delivering the second reading of the corporate governance and insolvency bill, Sharma, who is also COP26 president, was seen repeatedly wiping his face with a handkerchief, while the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, passed him a glass of water.His situation may have been caused by a bout of hay fever, Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis said on Thursday morning.Sharma’s condition brought into focus the new arrangements in the House of Commons, by which MPs who were in self-isolation were no longer allowed to participate or vote remotely but had to be present in person. It led to long queues around the Westminster complex on Tuesday during a vote.Besides Johnson, who was hospitalised in a serious condition after contracting virus in April, health secretary Matt Hancock and defence secretary Ben Wallace have also been affected, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-minister-alok-sharma-tests-negative/story-NKasNEYEZj6qm6Q0G2At0K.html
04-06-2020||World||Thousands join peaceful George Floyd protests in NYC, then an ambush amid curfew||A day that began with hope that New York City was beginning to find a way out of the crisis caused by the coronavirus and a week of angry demonstrations over police brutality ended Wednesday with more violence.Peaceful protests over the death of George Floyd drew thousands of people, but were broken up by police as rain poured down about an hour after the city’s 8 pm curfew went into effect.Then, with the streets quiet for the first time in days, police said a man ambushed officers on an anti-looting patrol in Brooklyn, stabbing him in the neck. The attacker was shot by responding officers and was in critical condition.Two officers suffered gunshot wounds to their hands in the chaos, but all three wounded officers were expected to recover.Police Commissioner Dermot Shea called it “a completely, cowardly, despicable, unprovoked attack on a defenseless police officer.” While he declined to say what motivated the attack, he drew a line to the heated rhetoric of the past week, in which angry crowds decrying police violence have also hurled insults, and sometimes bottles, bricks and firebombs, at officers and their vehicles.“Words matter,” Shea said.More protests were planned for Thursday around New York, and Gov. Andrew Cuomo called for a statewide moment of silence at 2 p.m., to coincide with a memorial service in Minnesota for Floyd.Wednesday night’s attack came at the end of the day in which the police had drawn praise for bringing a stop to days of pilfering and destruction in some parts of the city, but also harsh criticism for rough tactics used to enforce the city’s curfew.About an hour after the 8 p.m. deadline to get off the street, officers began moving in on crowds of demonstrators in Manhattan and Brooklyn, at times blasting people with pepper spray or using batons to shove people who didn’t move fast enough.Asked whether those officers had acted appropriately, de Blasio said Thursday that he had not seen videos of officers using batons on peaceful protesters. He added, “ if there’s anything that needs to be reviewed.”The mayor said protesters should observe the curfew that’s in place through Sunday. “If at a certain point, officers say, ‘It’s time, people need to go now,’ people need to listen to that,” he said.NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said about 60 people were arrested near Central Park for defying an order to go home.“When we have these big crowds, especially in this area, especially where we’ve had the looting, no more tolerance,” Monahan said. “They have to be off the street.”City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, who attended a rally in downtown Brooklyn, expressed outrage that police had broken up the peaceful demonstration by shoving protesters and hitting them with batons.“I can’t believe what I just witnessed & experienced,” Williams wrote on Twitter. He called the use of force on nonviolent protesters “disgusting.”As the evening deepened, there were few reports of the mayhem that had occurred on several days of demonstrations, when protesters burned police vehicles and showered officers with debris. Gone also were the roving bands of people who smashed their way into scores of stores and stole merchandise Sunday and Monday nights.During the day, some protesters had been heartened by news that three more Minneapolis police officers had been charged in connection to the May 25 death of Floyd, a black man who died after an officer pressed a knee on his neck.But most said they wanted bigger societal changes to fight institutional racism in policing.“There’s been progress, but are we at a point where we can all celebrate? No,” said demonstrator Lisa Horton, calling for “radical change” in the criminal justice system.Tuesday night’s protests had also been mostly peaceful, prompting de Blasio to declare that an early curfew was working.It is set to remain in effect through at least Sunday, with the city planning to lift it at the same time it enters the first phase of reopening after more than two months of shutdowns because of the coronavirus.___Jennifer Peltz, Brian Mahoney and Jake Seiner in New York City and Marina Villeneuve in Albany contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-join-peaceful-george-floyd-protests-in-nyc-then-an-ambush-amid-curfew/story-z90ToxDTVLC2PAiFDxZVfL.html
04-06-2020||World||George Floyd was infected with Covid-19, autopsy reveals||George Floyd, whose fatal encounter with Minneapolis police stirred a global outcry over racial bias by U.S. law enforcement, tested positive for the coronavirus, his autopsy showed, but the infection was not listed as a factor in his death.The official cause of death, according to the full 20-page report made public on Wednesday by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office, was cardiopulmonary arrest while Floyd was being restrained by police taking him into custody on May 25.The coroner ruled the manner of death to be a homicide. Four police officers since fired from their jobs for their role in the incident, which was captured on a bystander’s cellphone video, are being held on criminal charges, one of them accused of murder.The video showed that officer using his knee to press Floyd’s neck into the street for nearly nine minutes while the 46-year-old victim gasped for air and repeatedly groaned, “please, I can’t breathe.” Floyd was pronounced dead at a hospital a short time later.The video immediately went viral on the internet, igniting nine days of nationwide protest and civil strife. Demonstrators have also taken to the streets overseas, from Germany to New Zealand.The autopsy, in listing cardiopulmonary arrest as the cause of Floyd’s death, also cited “complicating law enforcement subdual, restraint and neck compression.”The report listed several additional factors as “significant conditions” contributing to Floyd’s death, including heart disease, high blood pressure and intoxication from the powerful opioid fentanyl, as well as recent methamphetamine use.The report further noted that a nasal swab sample collected from Floyd’s body came back positive for Covid-19, and that Floyd had also tested positive on April 3, nearly eight weeks before his death. The county’s chief medical examiner, Dr. Andrew Baker, concluded that the post mortem test result “most likely reflects asymptomatic but persistent ... positivity from previous infection.” There was no indication in the autopsy report that coronavirus played any role in Floyd’s death.Dr. Michael Baden, one of two medical examiners who conducted a private autopsy for Floyd’s family, told the New York Times that county officials never told him, or the funeral director, that Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-was-infected-with-covid-19-autopsy-reveals/story-P3YIr7u9pg06vxkzdeUsyJ.html
04-06-2020||World||Thousands of China’s movie screens could be shut forever||Thousands of film theatres in China could never open again under the impact of the Covid-19 outbreak, a new survey by film industry insiders has revealed, adding that lay-offs in the industry have also started.China has the largest number of movie screens in the world but all have been shut since January 23, the day the central Chinese city of Wuhan was locked down to contain the spread of the coronavirus.In 2019, China added 9708 new screens to take the total number of screens to 69787; in 2019, China also had the second-largest box office in the world after the US.The outbreak impact has already wiped out more than 30 billion yuan ($4.24 billion) from the 2020 box office, a government official said in April.Now, the survey, jointly done by the China Film Association (CFA), the China Film Distribution and Screening Association and leading cinema chains including Wanda, reveals a picture that’s not optimistic.Also read | Wuhan tests 10 million people, only 300 test positive for Covid-19“Under the continuous influence of the epidemic, more than 40% of the theatres may face survival difficulties,” the report said after conducting a survey of 187 theatres at the end of April.If the findings of the survey are extrapolated to the Chinese theatre and box office that would mean thousands of screens shut for ever and the loss of a large number of jobs.The Chinese government had said earlier that cinemas in regions with low coronavirus risks can reopen with reduced capacity and daily disinfecting measures but those measures are yet to be implemented.Some theatres, according to a Reuters report, were briefly allowed to reopen after the number of new cases sharply dropped in China. However, they were later shut again amid worries that early relaxation of lockdowns could spark another wave of infections.The long closure is impacting the livelihood of a large number of people involved in the long and complex chain of film making, distribution and screening.“The survey shows that at the end of March, 20% of the theaters had laid off staff. Most of these layoff theaters are small and medium-sized cinemas with less than 1,000 seats,” it said.“As many as 42% of theaters believe that they are at risk of ‘closing the door’; only 10% of theaters are likely to change hands and continue to operate,” the survey said.Will there be a boom after the outbreak is declared over? From the findings of the survey, the outlook isn’t optimistic.“Will theaters usher in an explosive movie watching boom after resuming business? Half of the theaters believe that it will take at least 3-6 months to reach the pre-epidemic viewing status after resuming business, and 37% of theaters believe that it will take more than half a year,” the survey added.According to Variety.com, the film and entertainment website, the closures would mean a year-on-year fall in box office of 66% from last year’s 64.3 billion yuan ($9.01 billion) to 21.8 billion yuan ($3.05 billion).However, a reopening that is delayed to October would cut 2020 revenues by 91%, down to just 5.79 billion yuan ($810 million), according to the CFA’s calculations.Also read | China says no ‘third party’ needed after PM Modi, Trump discuss Ladakh standoff||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-china-s-nearly-70-000-movie-screens-could-be-shut-forever/story-DTvfpbJuEpCxqcZrv2tTnI.html
04-06-2020||World||1.9 million in US seek jobless aid even as reopenings slow layoffs||Nearly 1.9 million people applied for US unemployment benefits last week, the ninth straight decline since applications spiked in mid-March, a sign that the gradual reopening of businesses has slowed the loss of jobs.The diminishing pace suggests that the job market meltdown that was triggered by the coronavirus may have bottomed out as more companies call at least some of their former employees back to work.The total number of people who are now receiving jobless aid rose only slightly to 21.5 million, suggesting that rehiring is offsetting some of the ongoing layoffs.Though applications for benefits are slowing, the latest weekly number is still more than double the record high that prevailed before the viral outbreak. It shows that there are limits to how much a partial reopening of the economy can restore a depressed job market mired in a recession.With all states in the process of gradually reopening for business, more consumers are starting to return to restaurants, stores and hair salons. That trend has boosted consumer spending from exceedingly low levels and has likely encouraged some companies to hire again.In addition to the laid-off employees who applied for benefits last week, 623,000 others sought jobless aid under a new program for self-employed and gig workers, who now qualify for unemployment benefits for the first time. These figures aren’t adjusted for seasonal variations, so the government doesn’t include them in the overall data.The figures come one day before the government’s jobs report for May is expected to show that employers slashed 8 million jobs last month and that the unemployment rate jumped from 14.7 per cent to 19.8 per cent. If those forecasts prove accurate, it would mean that nearly 30 million people have lost jobs since the viral outbreak intensified in March and that joblessness has reached its highest point since the Great Depression.Since mid-March, 42.7 million people have applied for unemployment benefits. Not all of them are still unemployed, though. Some have since been rehired. And some laid-off people, it turns out, filed duplicate applications for benefits as they struggled with unresponsive state unemployment systems.Thursday’s report wasn’t affected by the protests over the killing of George Floyd, which in recent days forced some major retailers and small businesses to close, because it covers claims filed only through May 30. But some economists warn that applications for unemployment aid could rise in next week’s report, reflecting business closures amid the protests and scattered vandalism.“That’s going to kick up the claims again,” said Jane Oates, a former Labor Department official.The depth of the job cuts since the virus forced the widespread shutdown of businesses reflects an economy gripped by the worst downturn since the Great Depression. The economy is thought to be shrinking in the April-June quarter at an annual rate approaching 40 per cent. That would be, by far, the worst quarterly contraction on record.Still, real-time private data on consumer behavior is showing signs that the economy is gradually reviving. Credit and debit card spending tracked by Chase Bank shows that consumer spending, though roughly flat last week, rebounded from its low point in mid-April, when it was 40 per cent below year-ago levels. Now, it is down 20 per cent from a year ago.Economists caution that most Americans will need to feel more confident about returning to their former habits of shopping, travelling and eating out before the economy can sustain any meaningful recovery. That will likely require the availability of a vaccine or a significant increase in testing.“What’s really going to move the needle economically is when consumers and businesses feel comfortable re-engaging with the economy the way they did before COVID-19,” said Adam Kamins, a senior regional economist at Moody’s Analytics.Some businesses that have reopened have seen only a limited number of customers so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/1-9-million-in-us-seek-jobless-aid-even-as-reopenings-slow-layoffs/story-pwSoSfp97hJ6YxBWhpmJiK.html
04-06-2020||World||Key Oxford Covid-19 vaccine trial extends to Brazil||The clinical trial for a vaccine for coronavirus conducted by experts at the University of Oxford will soon recruit 2,000 volunteers in Brazil – one of the worst affected countries – after the country’s health regulator approved the trial currently in its Phase II.The university said on Thursday that the widely-watched work on the vaccine is “progressing quickly”. The UK government and biopharma major AstraZeneca have been gearing up to put in place facilities to produce the vaccine on a mass scale, if the results are encouraging.The trial’s Phase I/II began in April in the UK to assess safety and immune response in over 1,000 healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years across several trial centres in southern England. As the trial moves to Phase III, a larger population is being enrolled consisting of 10,000 participants in the UK with AstraZeneca enrolling 30,000 participants in the US. The university said that on Tuesday, the Brazilian Health Regulatory Agency approved the inclusion of Brazil in the clinical trials. Brazil is a priority for the study because of the ascendant curve of the virus there.Andrew Pollard, chief investigator of the Oxford Vaccine Trial at Oxford, said: “We are delighted to be working with the talented team of investigators in Brazil on the Covid-19 vaccine trial, as researchers and scientists around the world collaborate on clinical development work with unprecedented urgency to combat the global threat to human health that is coronavirus.”The university said it is “advancing fast” on its ongoing response to address the challenges of Covid-19, and is working with AstraZeneca to define next steps on the supply of the vaccine widely to make it accessible around the world in an equitable manner. The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca announced an agreement on April 30 for the global development and distribution of the University’s potential recombinant adenovirus vaccine aimed at preventing Covid-19 infection from SARS-CoV-2.The agreement includes a commitment to make the vaccine available on a not-for-profit basis during the pandemic and to ensure broad and equitable access around the world. To date AstraZeneca has concluded agreements for at least 400 million doses and secured total manufacturing capacity for 1bn billion doses of the Oxford vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-oxford-covid-19-vaccine-trial-extends-to-brazil/story-o0rQNHfgo3fwNhdPDGDexN.html
04-06-2020||World||Memorial service to be held for George Floyd after week of nationwide protests||A memorial service was to be held Thursday for George Floyd after more than a week of nationwide protests over the African American’s death at the hands of a white police officer.Led by civil rights activist Al Sharpton, the ceremony will be held in Minneapolis, where Floyd died on May 25 after being detained by police.A video showing white officer Derek Chauvin kneeling on Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes as he pleaded for his life triggered rioting in the city and unleashed a nationwide wave of civil unrest unlike any seen in the US since the 1968 assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.Sharpton, who will give the eulogy for Floyd, met with his family on Wednesday.“Tomorrow we will lay out how we will mobilize nationally in the name of George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and more,” the leading rights activist said on Twitter, referring to a black jogger who was shot dead in February and a black medical worker killed by police in her own apartment in March.Floyd’s death reignited long-felt anger over police killings of African Americans, and echoed high-profile cases that spurred the Black Lives Matter movement.Minnesota prosecutors on Wednesday increased the charges against Chauvin to second-degree murder, roughly akin to manslaughter.His three colleagues at the scene of Floyd’s arrest for allegedly seeking to buy cigarettes with a counterfeit bill were charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder, and taken into custody.‘Bittersweet moment’ The arrest of all four officers has been a focus for tens of thousands of protesters who have marched in the streets of dozens of US cities, often defying curfews to condemn police brutality and demand racial justice.Floyd’s family, in a statement thanking protesters, called the arrests and new charges a “bittersweet moment” -- and a “significant step forward on the road to justice.”They urged Americans to continue to “raise their voices for change in peaceful ways.”With a key demand met, protestors nevertheless staged large and mainly peaceful rallies Wednesday calling for deeper change in cities from New York to Los Angeles, hours after the new indictments were announced.Most of the protests which have swelled in cities across the country since Floyd’s death have been peaceful, but some have degenerated into rioting.US cities including Los Angeles and Washington delayed the start of their curfews by several hours Wednesday after looting and violence had subsided the previous night, while Seattle scrapped its curfew with immediate effect.But several arrests were made in New York after groups of protesters continued to march in Manhattan and Brooklyn after the city’s 8:00 pm curfew had passed. In Manhattan, protester Brian Clark earlier said the charges were “a good start” but vowed demonstrators would “exercise our right to protest until every black person gets the justice they deserve.”“It’s not enough,” added fellow demonstrator Elijah B., who did not give his last name. “This could have happened a week ago... it wasn’t until people started marching on the streets and started tearing things that people started to pay attention.”A large group also protested at the US Capitol in Washington beyond curfew.Thousands took to the streets in Hollywood and downtown Los Angeles, where Mayor Eric Garcetti vowed to redirect $250 million toward black community health and education from budgets including the police department.‘Law and order’While condemning Floyd’s death, President Donald Trump has adopted a tough stance towards the protesters, saying they include many “bad people” and calling on governors to “dominate the streets.”“We need law and order,” he repeated on Wednesday.Pressure on Trump, who has rejected the traditional presidential role of healer in times of crisis, has mounted as his former Pentagon chief Jim Mattis accused the Republican leader of trying to divide America.Mattis called Trump “the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people -- does not even pretend to try.”“Instead, he tries to divide us,” the retired Marine general said in a blistering statement posted online by The Atlantic.Trump snapped back on Twitter, calling Mattis “the world’s most overrated General.”The US president has raised the possibility of invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy active duty troops to quell unrest.But Mattis’ successor Mark Esper said that option should only be used as “a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations.” “We are not in one of those situations now. I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act,” said the current defense secretary.White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany said Wednesday that the act remains “a tool available” to the president, who is facing a tough reelection battle in November.“The president wants to protect America’s streets,” McEnany said, describing the criticism from Mattis as “a self-promotional stunt to appease the DC elite.”Trump meanwhile denied media reports that he was rushed for his safety to the White House bunker while protests raged in the streets outside.“It was a false report,” Trump told Fox News Radio, before saying that he did go into the secure area for an “inspection” and only for a “tiny, little, short period of time.”Reports of Trump taking shelter sparked a wave of online mockery, which is believed to have contributed to his decision on Monday to make a controversial visit to a partly damaged church near the White House.Police violently dispersed mostly peaceful crowds of protesters to clear a path for Trump, and the photo opportunity was widely condemned.burs-mtp/dw||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/memorial-service-to-be-held-for-george-floyd-after-week-of-nationwide-protests/story-e8w3LuCt2JDv5Ga7ILoIGP.html

While Palestinians could be hurt by the move, it is an instrument of pressure the authority has wielded on several occasions to try to push Israel to reverse course on policy decisions. Without these transfers, which account for about 60% of its budget, the authority risks collapsing and forcing Israel to take responsibility for 2.6 million Palestinians.Israel has said it plans to annex some 30% of the West Bank, as provided for in the Trump administration’s Middle East peace plan. Action could be taken as early as July 1, under the new Israeli government’s coalition agreement.Hussein Al Sheikh, the Palestinian Authority’s head of the General Authority of Civil Affairs, said the rejection of the May tax transfer was an extension of last month’s declaration that the Palestinians are no longer bound to past agreements to cooperate with Israel and the U.S.“We refuse to be blackmailed by the Israeli government,” Palestinian government spokesman Ibrahim Melhim said.Israel’s Finance Ministry declined to comment. Under 1990s accords, Israel collects customs duties and other taxes on behalf of the Palestinians and transfers them to their limited self-rule government each month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/palestinians-reject-cash-from-israel-to-protest-annexation-plan/story-VgVxfINKhzZdQ29dsZRoQN.html

Unlike many other advanced economies, it included permanent residents who call Japan home and spouses of Japanese nationals among those forbidden to enter.Japan had encouraged foreign workers to come to the country to ease a labor shortage resulting from its aging and shrinking population. The number of foreign workers almost doubled to 1.5 million in 2019.Some resident foreigners are currently stuck outside the country, while others have missed family funerals overseas due to the travel ban, sparking an online campaign for a change in policy. Japanese nationals, though discouraged from traveling, are permitted to return.Japan Welcomed Foreign Workers Then Left Them in Covid-19 LimboPublic broadcaster NHK, which reported the news, said immigration authorities had given examples such as visiting a dying relative, attending a family funeral, or the need to attend follow-up exams after undergoing surgery overseas. The Immigration Services Agency did not immediately respond to a request for further details.Japan, whose strict border measures are set to stay in place at least until the end of June, has said it’s in discussions with Vietnam about the resumption of business travel between the two countries. The Asahi newspaper and others have said the country is also considering loosening restrictions on travel with Thailand, Australia and New Zealand, all of which have relatively few cases of the disease.Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi has said loosening of Japan’s borders in general is likely to start with business travel and visits by experts, followed by foreign students, with tourism likely to come later.The country’s travel policies are set to come to the test next year when Tokyo hosts the Summer Olympics, which were pushed back by a year due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-japan-to-allow-re-entry-of-foreign-nationals-on-humanitarian-grounds/story-egSvr4nvOV962k3C0uWrnJ.html

The suspect Li was arrested.Local authorities told state media that at least eight ambulances were dispatched to the school to rush the victims to the nearest hospitals.At least two of the victims were seriously injured in the knife attack.Their identities were not immediately revealed.No one had sustained a life-threatening injury, local authorities told state media.China has a history of knife attacks mostly carried out by disgruntled employees or mentally disturbed persons.A disgruntled school worker had gone a similar rampage at a primary school in Beijing in January, 2019, attacking 20 students, injuring at least three of them seriously.Many such attacks are triggered by personal grievances.In April, 2018, a 28-year-old man killed nine middle-school students as they were returning home in one of the country’s deadliest knife attacks in recent years, news agency AFP reported. The killer, who said he had been bullied when he attended the school in northern China’s Shaanxi province, was executed in September, the news agency further reported.In 2012, a knife-wielding man in central China had attacked dozens of kindergarten children because of family problems.Two children were stabbed to death outside a Shanghai kindergarten in June, 2018, while nine children died in a similar attack at a school in Shaanxi province in April.In October, 2018, a woman stabbed at least 14 children at a kindergarten in southwest China’s Chongqing city.Reports said a woman attacked the children with a kitchen knife inside the school.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-guard-stabs-39-including-children-inside-primary-school-in-south-china/story-6KQrRAEuMn1tUDZyYyYA1K.html

The motive remains unknown.The attack was an eerie throwback to deadly attacks at schools in China over past years that prompted security upgrades and that authorities have blamed largely on people bearing grudges or who had unidentified mental illnesses.The local government in the Guangxi region’s Cangwu county said 37 students and two adults suffered injuries of varying degrees in the attack.Chinese state media identified the attacker as a security guard at the school surnamed Li. The suspect had been detained while an investigation was underway, they said.State broadcaster CCTV said 40 had been injured, three seriously, including the head of the school, another security guard and a student.In earlier attacks, a woman wielding a knife injured 14 children at a kindergarten in the western city of Chongqing in October 2018.Almost 20 children were killed in school attacks in 2010, prompting a response from top government officials and leading many schools to add gates and security guards.Chinese law restricts the sale and possession of firearms, and mass attacks are generally carried out with knives or homemade explosives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/security-guard-injures-39-in-knife-attack-at-a-kindergarten-in-china/story-4xWyUuP3vzCx9cw49DZmEJ.html

Some hours later, she was found lying in a pool of blood. She died before help could arrive.A post-mortem report found she had been stabbed multiple times in the chest and stomach and had suffered head injuries. Police are still investigating the crime.Women engaging in sex work have always been more vulnerable to violence but a surge in physical attacks and killings of sex workers in Kenya since Covid-19 restrictions came into force has sent a chill through the community.This spike in violence was attributed not only to clients attacking sex workers but also by the police and other community members who blame them for spreading the coronavirus.“It’s really frightening what we are seeing happening across the country,” said Peninah Mwangi, executive director of the Bar Hostess Empowerment and Support Programme, a sex worker-led organisation with 10,000 members in Kenya.“Our girls are really scared. We are hearing of women going with clients, only to find their bodies dumped. In one case, a sex worker was killed by her client’s family when she went to his house. Even so, they are more scared of hunger than murder.”Lockdowns are forcing desperate sex workers to disregard usual safety norms to make a living, exposing them to increased violence - and even murder, according to sex worker groups.‘Easy target at a time of crisis’With brothels and guest houses closed, sex workers in countries such as Kenya, Uganda, Senegal and Botswana, are being compelled to work alone, risking their personal safety on the streets, in clients’ residences or even in their own homes.This has led to increased violence from clients, who are often demanding lower rates and more risqué services and attacking sex workers if they refuse.The Kenya Sex Workers Alliance (KESWA), a coalition of around 30 sex worker rights groups, said it has documented six murders of sex workers since the east African nation imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on March 27.“We have security tips such as don’t go with clients who appear suspicious, inform someone of your location and don’t go to a client’s place or take him home,” said Philester Abdalla, KESWA’s national coordinator.“But people are so broke and desperate that they are not following the rules. We have children who need food, landlords who are demanding rent,” she said, adding that she was currently sheltering five evicted sex workers in her home.KESWA has recorded 80 incidences of violence against sex workers by clients, neighbours and police in the first of the month of the pandemic compared to a monthly average of 25 incidents before Covid-19 hit Kenya in mid-March, she added.From Senegal in the west to Botswana in the south, shutdowns aimed at slowing the spread of the coronavirus across Africa have severely hit millions of sex workers who already live on the margins of society, according to campaigners.Customers are staying away for fear of contracting the virus, and restrictions on movement, shortages of transport and closures of bars and brothels have left sex workers struggling to survive.Most are excluded from government relief packages and many have been unable to pay their rent - or evicted after brothels where they stay shut down - leaving them homeless.Already criminalised, stigmatised, and blamed for the high prevalence of AIDS in Africa, sex workers have also become more susceptible to punitive measures by police enforcing Covid-19 regulations in many countries.Grace Kamau, regional coordinator for the African Sex Workers Alliance, said police in countries such as Uganda, Kenya Ivory Coast, Malawi, Zimbabwe and South Africa, were raiding brothels and bars, assaulting and arresting sex workers.“Sex workers are an easy target in a time of crisis. Clients feel they can take advantage of them, and law enforcement think they can use them to show that they are implementing Covid-19 measures,” said Kamau.“Even the community is blaming them. Sex workers are being forced to work in their homes during the day which attracts attention ... there have been incidences of mob justice where neighbours have attacked sex workers.”In Kenya, about 800 sex workers were arrested over the last two months, with about 400 placed in quarantine centres, accused of violating social distancing restrictions, according to KESWA.While in neighbouring Uganda, campaigners said sex workers were being unfairly targeted due to their association with truck drivers - some of who had tested positive. There were 117 arrests of sex workers over a 2 week period, they said.No access to HIV treatmentStay-at-home orders have also left sex workers unable to visit health clinics and access essential services for sexually transmitted infections (STIs), say health experts.Many of those living with HIV were unable to get the life-saving treatment they needed - potentially putting their compromised immune systems at risk if they contracted Covid-19.Female sex workers are 13 times more likely to become infected with HIV than adults in the general population, according to UNAIDS, with more than 50% of sex workers in some countries in eastern and southern Africa living with HIV.A survey of 884 sex workers in Kenya conducted by KESWA found more than 65% of respondents could not get condoms and medication for HIV, such as anti-retroviral drugs, due to price hikes on public transport linked to Covid-19 restrictions.“Some sex workers are scared to go to the clinics to collect their medication for fear of contracting Covid-19,” said Olive Mumba, executive director of the Eastern Africa National Networks of AIDS and Health Service Organisations.“For others, they do not have the transport or even the money for the transport. They would rather spend the few shillings they have on food than to fetch medicines.”Mumba said of particular concern were undocumented migrant sex workers in countries such Botswana, who regularly returned to their homes in neighbouring Zimbabwe to collect medication but were now forced off treatment due to borders being closed.“We are very concerned,” said Ed Ngoksin, technical advisor on community responses and key populations at the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.“From a programme’s perspective, lockdowns restrict the ability of community-based organisations to deliver services for sex workers, resulting in a lack of access to prevention, testing/treatment and care services.”He said the pandemic was having a “catastrophic impact” on communities such as sex workers and threatening to derail hard-fought progress against HIV, TB and malaria, diseases which kill millions annually.The Global Fund is providing $1 billion to help countries respond to the Covid-19, including funding sex worker-led groups to provide temporary shelters, food aid, and the home delivery of anti-retroviral drugs, Ngoskin added.Part of the solutionMany sex worker organisations are rallying members to fund raise and provide food packages for more vulnerable peers, while others are providing shelter to colleagues who have been evicted or physically abused by their partners.They are also providing them with a list of measures to help protect themselves from Covid-19 - from insisting clients sanitise their hands and conducting mobile money transactions, to avoiding kissing and positions with face-to-face contact.The Global Network of Sex Work Projects and UNAIDS have urged governments to support sex workers by giving them access to national social protection schemes, emergency aid if needed, and end evictions, brothel raids and arrests.Sex workers said they could also play an active role in stemming the pandemic if they were given the support they need.“Sex workers are indispensable allies in securing widespread adoption of effective public health measures,” said Daisy Nakato Namakula, national coordinator of Uganda Network of Sex Worker Organisations.“When sex workers are empowered and their human rights are respected, they can help communities rapidly adopt protective measures — we have seen this with HIV, and it should be the approach of Covid-19 as well. Instead, we are being attacked and discriminated against.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hunger-or-murder-lockdown-poverty-exposes-african-sex-workers-to-more-violence/story-8fwowZKKHuL1rgQKO1VFnK.html

It shows Gandhi in stride, as a leader and man of action evoking memories of his 1930 protest march against salt-tax, and the many padyatras (long marches) he undertook throughout the length and breadth of the Indian sub-continent.The statue, the design of which was created by Gautam Pal, is a gift from the Indian Council for Cultural Relations (ICCR). The pedestal for the statue of Mahatma Gandhi is a block of new Imperial Red also known as Ruby Red a block originally weighing 25 tonnes reduced to a size of 9’x7’x3’4”. It now weighs 16 tonnes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gandhi-s-statue-vandalised-in-us-indian-embassy-registers-complaint/story-1Gy6fCmAdNS0yGRhhHUYOK.html
04-06-2020||World||Fired watchdog says he told Pompeo aides of probe into spending||The State Department’s fired inspector general told lawmakers that he had told senior aides to Michael Pompeo that he was investigating the secretary of state and his wife for possible misuse of government funds, undercutting Pompeo’s claim that he knew nothing about the probe.Steve Linick also confirmed he was investigating Pompeo’s emergency declaration in May 2019 that allowed for $8 billion in weapons sales to Saudi Arabia over protests from Congress, according to a joint statement by five House and Senate Democrats who participated in interviewing him Wednesday. They said Linick told lawmakers he was “shocked” by his firing on May 16 and that subsequent justifications weren’t true.After President Donald Trump fired Linick, part of a pattern of ousting agency inspector generals he considered insufficiently loyal, Pompeo confirmed that he had recommended the dismissal. He argued that Linick wasn’t working in sync with the State Department’s mission statement. Officials later said Linick hadn’t adequately addressed claims that his office leaked a report into political retribution under Pompeo and his predecessor Rex Tillerson.The State Department declined immediate comment. Republican lawmakers who participated in Wednesday’s interview didn’t challenge the Democrats’ account but said they still had unanswered questions about Linick’s alleged leaks, which were investigated by the Defense Department’s inspector general.“While today’s briefing did help to answer some questions, many more were left outstanding, including why the DOD IG’s investigation into Linick was ‘limited’ and why Linick withheld the DOD IG’s report from his superiors at State,” Leslie Shedd, a spokesperson for Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, said in a statement.Pompeo has ridiculed reports that he was the subject of Linick’s investigations and told the Washington Post that he had no knowledge that the inspector general was looking into whether he and his wife had used diplomatic security agents to run personal errands and were at fault for other abuses of government funds.But Linick told lawmakers he had discussed the matter personally with Deputy Secretary of State Stephen Biegun and Undersecretary for Management Brian Bulatao, and sought documents from Pompeo’s office.“He stated that his staff had these discussions so State Department leadership ‘would not be surprised,”’ the Democrats said.Linick said Pompeo refused his request for an interview about the emergency declaration for the Saudi arms deal after the inspector general insisted on the presence of a witness from the inspector general’s office.Although Pompeo repeatedly refused to answer questions from reporters on why he got Trump to fire the inspector general, he accused Linick in a May 28 interview with Fox News of leaking information and “investigating policies he simply didn’t like.”“This didn’t have anything to do with retaliation,” Pompeo told Laura Ingraham. “This was about an IG who was attempting to undermine the mission of the United States Department of State.”According to the Democratic lawmakers, Linick called Pompeo’s explanations “either misplaced or unfounded.” He accused Bulatao of “bullying” him by saying the Saudi investigation wasn’t appropriate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fired-watchdog-says-he-told-pompeo-aides-of-probe-into-spending/story-Vq6beB7imGDje0wyc1br1N.html
04-06-2020||World||After North Korea’s threat, South Korea rushes to bring new laws to ban border protests||South Korea said Thursday it planned to push new laws to ban activists from flying anti-Pyongyang leaflets over the border after North Korea threatened to end an inter-Korean military agreement reached in 2018 to reduce tensions if Seoul fails to prevent the protests.The South’s desperate attempt to keep alive a faltering diplomacy will almost certainly trigger debates over freedom of speech in one of Asia’s most vibrant democracies.Sending balloons across the border has been a common activist tactic for years, but North Korea considers it an attack on its government. Defectors and other activists in recent weeks have used balloons to fly leaflets criticizing the North’s authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un over his nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record.While Seoul has sometimes sent police officers to block such activities during times of high tension, it had resisted the North’s calls to fully ban them, saying the activists were exercising their freedoms.The shift followed remarks earlier in the morning from Kim’s powerful sister, who threatened to end the military agreement and said the North could permanently shut a liaison office and an inter-Korean factory park that have been major symbols of reconciliation.In her statement released through state media, Kim Yo Jong called the defectors involved in the balloon launches “human scum” and “mongrel dogs” who betrayed their homeland and said it was “time to bring their owners to account,” referring to the government in Seoul.Yoh Sang-key, spokesman of South Korea’s Unification Ministry, said the balloon campaigns were threatening the safety of residents living in the border area and that his government will push for legal changes to “fundamentally resolve tension-creating activities.”When asked whether the ministry would specifically express regret over the North’s threat to abandon inter-Korean agreements, Yoh said: “we will substitute our evaluation (of the North Korean) statement with the announcement of the government position (on the issue).”South Korea’s ruling liberal party and its satellite party have 180 seats in the 300-seat National Assembly after winning April’s elections, giving it a solid majority to win approval for the proposal in parliament.North Korea’s latest denouncement of the balloon protests follows months of frustration over the South’s unwillingness to defy US-led international sanctions against the North.Kim Yo Jong took a higher profile in North Korean affairs as part of her brother’s diplomatic efforts in 2018 and has been issuing her first public statements as that diplomacy has slowed in recent months. State media has carried her comments ridiculing Seoul for protesting a North Korean military drill but praising President Donald Trump for offering to help the North with anti-virus efforts.“(South Korean) authorities will be forced to pay a dear price if they let this situation go on while making sort of excuses,” she said in advocating South Korea outlaw the balloon protests.“If they fail to take corresponding steps for the senseless act against the fellow countrymen, they had better get themselves ready for possibility of the complete withdrawal of the already desolate Kaesong Industrial Park following the stop to tour of (Diamond Mountain), or shutdown of the (North-South) joint liaison office whose existence only adds to trouble, or the scrapping of the (North-South) agreement in military field which is hardly of any value.”In a separate statement, the international affairs department of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party accused U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of spewing “rubbish” over his critical comments toward Beijing, which is Pyongyang’s biggest ally.In a Fox News interview on Sunday, Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party was putting Americans at risk because it has come to “view itself as intent upon the destruction of Western ideas, Western democracies, Western values.”The department’s unidentified spokesman also commented on the intensifying protests in the United States over the death of George Floyd, saying that the unrest exposes harsh realities in America.“Demonstrators enraged by the extreme racists throng even to the White House. This is the reality in the U.S. today. American liberalism and democracy put the cap of leftist on the demonstrators and threaten to unleash even dogs for suppression.”Seoul has touted the military agreement, reached during the third summit between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, as a major step in the peace process.The Koreas had agreed to jointly search for human remains from the 1950-53 Korean War and take steps to reduce conventional military threats, such as establishing buffer and no-fly zones. They also removed some front-line guard posts and jointly surveyed a waterway near their western border to allow freer civilian navigation.However, the North has been less enthusiastic about upholding inter-Korean agreements as the larger nuclear talks with the U.S. stalemate. North Korea has suspended virtually all cooperation with the South, while also pressuring Seoul to break away from Washington and restart the joint economic projects, which would breathe life into the North’s broken economy.“If they truly value the (North-South) agreements and have a will to thoroughly implement them, they should clear their house of rubbish,” said Kim Yo Jong, who’s considered her brother’s closest confidant.The liaison office in Kaesong has been closed since late January after the Koreas agreed to temporarily shut down until the coronavirus outbreak is controlled.The North has also postponed plans to tear down South Korean-made hotels and other facilities at the North’s Diamond Mountain resort as part of its virus-prevention efforts. It has said there hasn’t been a single case of Covid-19 on its territory, a claim widely disbelieved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seoul-vows-to-stop-border-protests-after-pyongyang-s-threat/story-wXTwTh2D9Guiywn6YDWlvJ.html
04-06-2020||World||Hackers group targets California University leading Covid-19 research||A group of hackers with a history of targeting healthcare organizations executed a successful ransomware attack this week on the University of California, San Francisco.UCSF confirmed it was the target of an “illegal intrusion” but declined to explain which portion of its IT network may have been compromised. Researchers at the university are among those leading American antibody testing and clinical trials for possible coronavirus treatments, including a recent study on anti-malarial drugs touted by President Donald Trump as a possible remedy, then refuted by scientists.The university has alerted security experts and law enforcement of the attack, which didn’t affect its patient care operations, said Peter Farley, a director of communications at UCSF.“With their assistance, we are conducting a thorough assessment of the incident, including a determination of what, if any, information may have been compromised,” Farley said in a statement. “In order to preserve the integrity of the investigation, we will need to limit what we can share at this time.”Read more: Malaria Drug Taken by Trump Provides No Covid-19 ProtectionThe NetWalker hackers claimed credit for the attack on their darkweb blog. The post dedicated to UCSF appeared to be copy and pasted from the university’s home page promoting its work on healthcare.Attack groups often post data samples to prove the success of their breach. In this case, their blog posted four screenshots, including of two files accessed by the attackers. The files’ names, seen by Bloomberg on the darkweb, contain possible references to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and departments central to the university’s coronavirus research.The blog includes a flashing-red timer threatening “secret data publication” by June 8 Pacific Time if payment isn’t received. The post doesn’t mention the value of ransom demanded.In most ransomware cases, payment is followed by the exchange of a decryption key that allows victims to gain access to their files. When victims don’t pay, which is often the case when they have backup copies to restore their data, attack groups sometimes publish the most sensitive data in hopes of coaxing payment.Hackers are increasingly targeting institutions like UCSF not only for ransomware payments themselves, but also for possibly lucrative intellectual property, like valuable research on a cure for Covid-19. UCSF has engaged in extensive sampling and anti-body testing, including on the experimental anti-viral drug remdesivir, which has shown signs of being effective early in the Covid-19 life-cycle.The US was hit by a record volume of ransomware attacks in 2019 and attackers have shown little sign of relenting in 2020, when users spent more time on less secure networks while working from home. In 2019, at least 966 government agencies, schools and healthcare providers were attacked at a cost of more than $7.5 billion, according to the cyber research firm Emsisoft. Among those were almost 90 universities.Netwalker ransomware was first introduced and operated by the criminal cyber group dubbed Circus Spider by CrowdStrike Inc. Since September 2019, Netwalker ransomware has been actively used by criminal actors with links to malware including Mailto, Koko, and KazKavKovKiz.“The use of Covid-19 lures and targeting entities in the healthcare sector indicate that the operators of Netwalker are taking advantage of the global pandemic in order to gain notoriety and increase their customer base,” according to a Crowdstrike research report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hackers-group-targets-california-university-leading-covid-19-research/story-QBUs0BNqnAlM00C96aMr0L.html
04-06-2020||World||Trump confronted defense chief Esper over comments on protests||President Donald Trump confronted his Defense secretary, Mark Esper, after the Pentagon chief publicly opposed the idea of deploying the military to contain protests, according to people familiar with the matter.Separately, the president later asked top advisers if they thought Esper could still be effective in his position, two people familiar with the discussions said on Wednesday night.At a news conference in the afternoon, the president’s press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, tiptoed around whether Esper’s job was safe, saying only that he remained in his post.Neither the White House nor the Pentagon immediately responded to requests for comment on Wednesday night.Esper met with Trump in the Oval Office after telling reporters at the Pentagon that active-duty military forces to perform law enforcement within the US is “a matter of last resort” and that the National Guard was better-suited to the task.On Monday, Trump had threatened to send military forces to cities and states that fail to quell violence spiraling from protests over the death in Minneapolis last week of a black man in police custody.The defense chief also appeared to back away from his boss by saying that while he knew he would be joining Trump to walk into Lafayette Square in front of the presidential residence on Monday, he was not aware of specific plans, including what would happen when the group reached St. John’s Episcopal Church.Trump has been criticized by religious leaders and Democrats, as well as some Republicans and former military officials, for the visit to the historic church, where he stood briefly holding up a Bible after security forces cleared peaceful protesters from the area using pepper balls and smoke cannisters.Esper said at the Pentagon on Wednesday that he thought he would be reviewing damage in the plaza and at the church, but wasn’t briefed on a specific plan since he was called back to the White House after heading toward a command center at the Department of Justice.“I did know we were going to the church. I did not know a photo op was happening,” Esper said.His remarks generated irritation at the White House, where three Trump aides who asked not to be identified said the secretary should have moderated his comments to draw less of a distinction with the president.Later Wednesday, a blistering denunciation of Trump by his first Defense secretary, Jim Mattis, was published by The Atlantic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-confronted-defense-chief-esper-over-comments-on-protests/story-Z611AwIdghYA0GZ1P54UrN.html
04-06-2020||World||George Floyd tested positive for Covid-19 in April: Report||George Floyd, the African-American, who died in police custody last month, had tested positive for the coronavirus in April, according to the medical examiner’s report.A report in The New York Times (NYT) cited the full autopsy released by the Hennepin County medical examiner and said that the 46-year-old had tested positive for the coronavirus on April 3.The county’s top medical examiner Andrew Baker said that the Minnesota Department of Health had swabbed Floyd’s nose after his death and he had tested positive for the virus, the NYT report said.The positive result at the time of his death was likely a lasting positive result from his previous infection, it said.The report added that there is no indication that the virus played any role in his death.Protests across New York and the US intensified as thousands of demonstrators took to the streets demanding an end to police brutality after Floyd was killed when a white police officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes while he lay handcuffed and pinned to the ground gasping for breath on May 25.“Please, I can’t breathe,” were Floyd’s last words and have become a clarion call for the protesters demanding action against police brutality.Former New York City medical examiner Michael Baden, who was among two doctors who conducted a private autopsy for Floyd’s family last week, said county officials did not tell him that Floyd had tested positive for Covid-19.“The funeral director wasn’t told, and we weren’t told, and now a lot of people are running around trying to get tested,” Baden said.“If you do the autopsy and it’s positive for the coronavirus, it’s usual to tell everyone who is going to be in touch with the body. There would have been more care,” he said.Baden has said that the four police officers who arrested Floyd should also get tested for Covid-19 as should some of the witnesses.“I’m not angry,” he said in the NYT report. “But there would have been more care.” Baden added in the NYT report that the full autopsy includes information he did not have access to, such as the toxicology results showing. Floyd had fentanyl in his system.Baden said that when he conducted the autopsy report, a part of the heart was not provided — the part that showed coronary artery disease.Forensics expert at John Jay College of Criminal Justice Lawrence Kobilinsky said he was struck by the difference between the county’s official autopsy and the results of Baden’s private autopsy.Kobilinsky said defense lawyers could make a point of the amount of fentanyl in Floyd’s body. The NYT report said while the amount required to be lethal varies from person to person, fentanyl can stop a person’s heart and breathing.“It seems to me, it’s high enough where a defense attorney would argue that this kind of predisposes him to heart failure, when you are on a drug like this,” Kobilinsky said.Baden has acknowledged that the amount of fentanyl in Floyd’s body was “considerable,” which would be particularly important if he had never used the drug before.“He has enough that could be a cause of death if he had never had immunity or tolerance to the drug,” Baden said in the NYT report adding that “restraint is what caused the death.” According to the Johns Hopkins University data, there are more than 1.8 million confirmed coronavirus cases in the US with over 107,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-tested-positive-for-covid-19-in-april-report/story-3F3xLHxI4FrSMIFXotP8yK.html
04-06-2020||World||James Mattis takes charge of US military pushback to President Donald Trump||Former US defence secretary James Mattis joined White House protesters in spirit on Wednesday with a stinging rebuke of Donald Trump’s handling of the protests calling him the only President in his lifetime “who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try”.Mattis is the first former Trump cabinet member to come out so publicly to criticise the president. He also joins a growing list of past and present top defence leaders who have either explicitly criticised Trump or distanced themselves from him for using US military personnel against protesters, specially those who brutally swept aside demonstrators to make way for the President’s now-infamous photo-op at a church, with a copy of the Bible in hand.“Donald Trump is the first President in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people - does not even pretend to try. Instead he tries to divide us,” Mattis wrote in a statement to The Atlantic, a news publication. “We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort.”“We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership,” he added. Mattis is a highly regarded marine general who Trump loved talking up before they fell out over difference on Syria in the winter of 2018. He was also one of the most bullish of US defence secretaries on closer defence ties with India. He took it upon himself to personally pilot an exemption clause for India, though not explicitly, from a US law that sanctions countries for large defence purchases from Russia.Mattis’ statement came just hours after Mark Esper, his successor at the Pentagon, tried to distance himself from the use of US military personnel against protesters and, more specifically, from the use of force to disperse peaceful demonstrators from Lafayette Square so that Trump and his entourage could walk unmolested to a nearby church for a photo-op to counter uncharitable media coverage of the President taking shelter in the White House underground bunker on the first night of protests.“The option to use active duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort, and only in the most urgent and dire of situations,” Esper told reporters. “We are not in one of those situations now.“I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act,” he added in a significant departure from the US President’s open advocacy of the 200-year-old law to force states to allow US military forces.Former chairman of the US chiefs of staff Mike Mullen wrote the day before in a piece titled “I cannot remain silent”, also in The Atlantic, “I remain confident in the professionalism of our men and women in uniform. They will serve with skill and with compassion. They will obey lawful orders. But I am less confident in the soundness of the orders they will be given by this commander in chief, and I am not convinced that the conditions on our streets, as bad as they are, have risen to the level that justifies a heavy reliance on military troops. Certainly, we have not crossed the threshold that would make it appropriate to invoke the provisions of the Insurrection Act.”Other past US military leaders have spoken out as well recently. But Mattis, or someone with matching clout in the military was the voice that was awaited to unlock the frustration said to have been building up in the forces against the flagrant politicisation of one of the most respected of US institutions.Trump acknowledged the mounting pushback from US military establishment, when he tried to cut down Mattis, belittling him. “Probably the only thing Barack Obama & I have in common is that we both had the honor of firing Jim Mattis, the world’s most overrated General,” he wrote in a tweet.“His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations. I gave him a new life, things to do, and battles to win, but he seldom ‘brought home the bacon’. I didn’t like his “leadership” style or much else about him, and many others agree. Glad he is gone!”But can Trump turn the tide?A new fence outside the White House has kept protesters further away than before, and some more. But it has not deterred them from showing up in larger numbers. They sit around, sing, chant slogans and occasionally fling two-word expletives in the direction of the White House, too far away to matter.They were entirely peaceful. As were protesters in New York city, largely, and other parts of the country. Protesters have been policing themselves. They try and prevent those among them that try to break into stores, or violently confront law enforcement officers, and destroying property.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/james-mattis-takes-charge-of-us-military-pushback-to-president-donald-trump/story-cBHh5NVcXyNpX3gBFKAGtK.html
04-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Canada’s Supreme Court to hold virtual hearings||The Covid-19 pandemic is ringing in systemic changes in the manner in which the branches of Government in Canada operate. The country’s Supreme Court has announced that it will, for the first time in history, start virtual hearings. That came as the Speaker of Canada’s House of Commons, equivalent of the Lok Sabha, said technology was in place for start remote voting.The Canadian Supreme Court has released a list of matters that it will hear via video conferencing starting next week. In a statement, Chief Justice Richard Wagner said, “While the Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to close our building to physical visitors for everyone’s health and safety, it hasn’t stopped us from doing our work. We may not be able to welcome members of the public to our physical courtroom, but we are excited to invite everyone to our virtual courtroom for the first time.”These hearings will be live-streamed on the court’s website, and the platform that will be used for the purpose will also make provisions for observers to “view” the proceedings as they would in the actual court chambers in Ottawa.As the Supreme Court is going virtual, Canada’s House of Commons may soon allow its members to vote on matters like legislation. Speaker Anthony Rota told a House Committee that they were “technically ready for virtual voting.”The country’s Parliament was adjourned in March due to the coronavirus crisis, but special sittings related to the combating the disease and the various facets of its impacts have taken place. Some were in person, with a minimum number of MPs in attendance, others were done remotely. Late last month, these focused sittings transitioned to “hybrid” sessions, with MPs joining in remotely while some were present in the chamber.The virtual vote could become a reality by the end of this month, as a spokesperson for the Government’s Leader in the House Pablo Rodriguez told the agency Canadian Press that they were “100 per cent in favour of electronic voting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-canada-s-supreme-court-to-hold-virtual-hearings/story-i8ta5cUsnf2rAVYD5lNnBL.html

Hong Kong has had relatively few cases of the virus and life has largely returned to normal in the city of 7.4 million.However, China has long detested the vigil, the only such activity allowed on Chinese territory to commemorate victims of the crackdown, which remains a taboo subject on the mainland. Hundreds, possibly thousands of people were killed when tanks and troops assaulted the center of Beijing to break up weeks of student-led protests seen as posing a threat to authoritarian Communist Party rule.The cancellation also comes amid a tightening of Beijing’s grip over Hong Kong, with the National People’s Congress, China’s ceremonial parliament, moving to pass national security legislation that circumvents Hong Kong’s local legislature and could severely limit free speech and opposition political activity.In Hong Kong, a law is being passed to make it a crime to disrespect China’s national anthem and 15 well-known veteran activists were arrested and charged with organizing and taking part in illegal demonstrations. Those actions are seen as part of a steady erosion of civil rights Hong Kong was guaranteed when it was handed over from British to Chinese rule in 1997.“The ban comes amid an alarming acceleration of attacks on the autonomy of Hong Kong and the undermining of the rights and freedoms of the Hong Kong people guaranteed under Hong Kong and international law” Sharon Hom, executive director of Human Rights in China, said in a statement.Despite the ban on the vigil, the Asian financial hub was bracing for “pop-up” protests of the type that raged around the city during months of anti-government protests last year that often led to violent confrontations between police and demonstrators.Thousands have been arrested over the demonstrations, which were sparked by proposed legislation that could have seen suspects extradited to mainland China where they could face torture and unfair, politically biased trials.The Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic and Democratic Movements of China that organizes the annual vigil has called on people around the city to light candles at 8 p.m. (1200 GMT) and plans to livestream the commemorations on its website www.64live.org.Other vigils, virtual and otherwise, are planned elsewhere, including in Taiwan, the self-ruled island democracy whose government called again this year for Beijing to own up to the facts of the crackdown.That drew a strong response from Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian, who called the statement “complete nonsense.”“As to the political disturbance that occurred in the late 1980s, the Chinese government has had a clear conclusion. The great achievements that we have achieved ... have fully demonstrated that the development path China has chosen is completely correct, which conforms to China’s national conditions and has won the sincere support of the Chinese people,” Zhao told reporters at a daily briefing.US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo marked the crackdown anniversary on Tuesday, a day after federal forces used tear gas to clear peaceful protesters from a park in front of the White House.Pompeo tweeted criticism of China and Hong Kong for banning the vigil before meeting privately with a group of Tiananmen Square survivors at the State Department. That too drew criticism from China.Alongside the exchanges of rhetoric, China’s small, beleaguered dissident community has again come under greater scrutiny from the authorities. Many have been placed under house arrest and their communications with the outside world cut off, according to rights groups.China has released the last of those arrested for directly taking part in the Tiananmen demonstrations, but others who seek to commemorate them have been rearrested for continuing their activism.They include Huang Qi, founder of website 64 Tianwang that sought to expose official wrongdoing. Reportedly in failing health, he is serving a 12-year-sentence after being convicted of leaking state secrets abroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiananmen-anniversary-marked-by-crackdown-hong-kong-vigil-ban/story-RONVhqehqGfGBTPxVLQZ3N.html
04-06-2020||World||China eases foreign flight curbs after US order targets Chinese carriers||China said on Thursday it will allow more foreign carriers to fly into the mainland, shortly after Washington barred Chinese passenger carriers from flying to the United States citing Beijing’s restrictions on American airlines. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) said in a statement that qualifying foreign carriers currently barred from operating flights to mainland China will be allowed once-per-week flights into a city of their choosing starting on June 8.Hong Kong and Macau, though part of China, have their own aviation authorities and set their own rules. US President Donald Trump’s administration has barred Chinese passenger carriers from flying into America starting June 16 as it pressures Beijing to let US airlines to resume flights to the country.The CAAC in late March said Chinese airlines could maintain just one weekly passenger flight on one route to any given country and that carriers could fly no more than the number of flights they were flying on March 12. But because US passenger airlines had stopped all flights by March 12, they have been unable to resume flights to China. The CAAC also said all airlines will be allowed to increase the number of international flights involving China to two per week if no incoming passengers on their flights test positive for Covid-19 for 3 consecutive weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-eases-foreign-flight-curbs-after-us-order-targets-chinese-carriers/story-wxMsIW6RtkPw3uuE1UpCsI.html
04-06-2020||World||Amid anti-racism protests after George Floyd’s death, NFL star Drew Brees’ remarks trigger row||National Football League (NFL) star Drew Brees said he would not support renewed kneeling protests on Wednesday, saying to do so would be “disrespecting the flag” of the United States.When asked about the ongoing protests, Brees told Yahoo Finance, “I will never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag of the United States of America or our country.”“When I look at the flag of the United States, I envision my two grandfathers, who fought for this country during World War II, one in the Army and one in the Marine Corp.“Is everything right with our country right now? No, it is not. We still have a long way to go.Brees is the NFL’s all-time passing yardage leader and one of the biggest names in the sport.As a wave of protests against police brutality and racism sweeps across the US, many athletes have voiced support for former NFL star Colin Kaepernick, who ignited controversy in 2016 by kneeling during the US national anthem.Although the kneeling controversy largely subsided in recent NFL seasons, the issue of player activism has returned following the US protests triggered by the death in police custody last week of George Floyd, an unarmed African-American man in Minneapolis.NBA superstar LeBron James, former NBA player Stephen Jackson, and even many of Brees’ teammates slammed him for the comments.“Is it still surprising at this point. Sure isn’t!” James said on Twitter. “You literally still don’t understand why Kap was kneeling on one knee?? Has absolute nothing to do with the disrespect of (the flag) and our soldiers(men and women) who keep our land free. My father-in-law was one of those.”Jackson, who was friends with Floyd and has become one of the leading voices of protestors, also ripped into Brees.“Bad timing, Drew Brees. Bad timing, bruh. All right? You play for New Orleans and you live in New Orleans. All them black people in New Orleans support you. Drew Brees, you gotta be a little more sensitive to the timing,” he said in a video.Brees’ public comments were his first following the death of Floyd, who died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25. In the week since, thousands have protested in cities throughout the US, with police often clashing with protesters and looters.Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, was arrested last week and charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. A second-degree murder charge against him was added Wednesday. He had pressed his knee on the neck of Floyd, a black man, for more than eight minutes.Three other former Minneapolis police officers were charged Wednesday with abetting Chauvin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-anti-racism-protests-after-george-floyd-s-death-nfl-star-drew-brees-remarks-trigger-row/story-COIt6d2Y39rCT9eWYyBJaM.html

Morelli issued a statement in which he said he is “ashamed of my comments and behavior” and acknowledged his participation in “Facebook trolling.”Morelli had told police on Monday that someone had gained access to his Facebook account to post racist comments about Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into his neck for several minutes even after Floyd stopped moving and pleading for air. An investigation determined that Morelli made the comments, police said.Police have not disclosed the nature of Morelli’s comments beyond that they were about Floyd. It was unclear on Wednesday if he had hired an attorney.Brewer police said Morelli was issued a summons and is due in court on July 15.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deputy-mayor-of-a-maine-city-charged-in-case-of-offensive-george-floyd-post/story-RS7LJEFJrUmrWfb8pF4xLN.html
04-06-2020||World||Wuhan tests 10 million people, only 300 test positive for Covid-19||The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the coronavirus was first detected late last year, has tested nearly 10 million people in an unprecedented 19-day campaign to check an entire city.It identified just 300 positive cases, all of whom had no symptoms. The city found no infections among 1,174 close contacts of the people who tested positive, suggesting they were not spreading the virus easily to others.That is a potentially encouraging development because of widespread concern that infected people without symptoms could be silent spreaders of the disease.“It not only makes the people of Wuhan feel at ease, it also increases people’s confidence in all of China,” Feng Zijian, vice director of China’s Center for Disease Control and Prevention, told state broadcaster CCTV.There is no definitive answer yet on the level of risk posed by asymptomatic cases, with anecdotal evidence and studies to date producing conflicting answers.Wuhan was by far the hardest hit city in China, accounting for more than 80% of the country’s deaths, according to government figures.A city official announced Tuesday that the city completed 9.9 million tests from May 14 to June 1. If those tested previously are included, virtually everyone above the age of 5 in the city of 11 million people has been tested, said Li Lanjuan, a member of a National Health Commission expert team.“The city of Wuhan is safe,” she said at a news conference with city officials.The campaign was launched after a small cluster of cases was found in a residential compound, sparking concern about a possible second wave of infections as Wuhan emerged from a 2 1/2 month lockdown.The industrial city on the Yangtze River in central China spent 900 million yuan (about $125 million) on the tests, the official Xinhua News Agency said. It quoted Executive Deputy Mayor Hu Yabo as saying the cost was “totally worthwhile” to reassure residents, lifting a “psychological lockdown.”Clarence Tam, an assistant professor of public health at the National University of Singapore, called the results reassuring but said more information is needed about the value of this kind of mass screening when the risk is already low.He noted that the tests, while generally accurate, sometimes give a positive result for uninfected people, and the very low number in Wuhan was well within the range of expected error.“As more countries adopt mass screening strategies, a challenge will be to try and minimize the chances of detecting false positives,” Tam said in an email response to The Associated Press. “This has some implications, because in Wuhan for example, those who tested positive and more than 1,000 of their contacts were quarantined.”The rapid testing of so many people was made possible in part through batch testing, in which samples from up to five people are mixed together, Xinhua reported. If the result is positive, then the people are individually tested.National resources were also mobilized to help, said Wang Weihua, deputy director of the Wuhan Health Commission, according to Xinhua. Together, these efforts raised Wuhan’s daily testing capacity from 300,000 to more than one million, she was quoted as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wuhan-tests-10-million-people-only-300-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-K8XOkHdXho1MGn6wgdCqEK.html
04-06-2020||World||North Korea spars with neighbour over balloons bringing in anti-Kim leaflets||North Korea threatened on Thursday to end an inter-Korean military agreement reached in 2018 to reduce tensions if the South fails to prevent activists from flying anti-Pyongyang leaflets over the border.Kim Yo Jong, the powerful sister of North Korea’s leader, also said the North could permanently shut a liaison office with the South and an inter-Korean factory park in the border town of Kaesong, which have been major symbols of reconciliation between the Koreas.North Korean defectors and other activists in recent weeks have used balloons to fly leaflets criticizing the North’s authoritarian leader Kim Jong Un over his nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record.Sending balloons across the border has been a common activist tactic for years, but North Korea considers it an attack on its government. It wants them banned, but Seoul refuses and says the activists and defectors are exercising free speech.In her statement released through state media, Kim Yo Jong called those defectors “human scum” and “mongrel dogs” who betrayed their homeland and said it was “time to bring their owners to account,” referring to the government in Seoul.“(South Korean) authorities will be forced to pay a dear price if they let this situation go on while making sort of excuses,” she said.“If they fail to take corresponding steps for the senseless act against the fellow countrymen, they had better get themselves ready for possibility of the complete withdrawal of the already desolate Kaesong Industrial Park following the stop to tour of (Diamond Mountain), or shutdown of the (North-South) joint liaison office whose existence only adds to trouble, or the scrapping of the (North-South) agreement in military field which is hardly of any value.”In a separate statement, the international affairs department of the North’s ruling Workers’ Party accused U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo of spewing “rubbish” over his critical comments toward Beijing, which is Pyongyang’s biggest ally.In a Fox News interview on Sunday, Pompeo said the Chinese Communist Party was putting Americans at risk because it has come to “view itself as intent upon the destruction of Western ideas, Western democracies, Western values.”The department’s unidentified spokesman also commented on the intensifying protests in the United States over the death of George Floyd, saying that the unrest exposes harsh realities in America.“Demonstrators enraged by the extreme racists throng even to the White House. This is the reality in the U.S. today. American liberalism and democracy put the cap of leftist on the demonstrators and threaten to unleash even dogs for suppression.”South Korea’s government didn’t immediately react to Kim Yo Jong’s comments.It has touted the military agreement, reached during the third summit between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in, as a major step in the peace process.The Koreas had agreed to jointly search for human remains from the 1950-53 Korean War and take steps to reduce conventional military threats, such as establishing buffer and no-fly zones. They also removed some front-line guard posts and jointly surveyed a waterway near their western border to allow freer civilian navigation.However, the North has been less enthusiastic about upholding inter-Korean agreements as the larger nuclear talks with the US stalemate. North Korea has suspended virtually all cooperation with the South, while also pressuring Seoul to break away from Washington and restart the joint economic projects, which would breathe life into the North’s broken economy.“If they truly value the (North-South) agreements and have a will to thoroughly implement them, they should clear their house of rubbish,” said Kim Yo Jong, who’s considered her brother’s closest confidant.The liaison office in Kaesong has been closed since late January after the Koreas agreed to temporarily shut down until the coronavirus outbreak is controlled.The North has also postponed plans to tear down South Korean-made hotels and other facilities at the North’s Diamond Mountain resort as part of its virus-prevention efforts. It has said there hasn’t been a single case of Covid-19 on its territory, a claim widely disbelieved.Kim Yo Jong’s comments follow months of frustration over the South’s unwillingness to defy U.S.-led international sanctions against the North and resume South Korean tours at the site.After years in her brother’s shadow, Kim Yo Jong emerged as part of her brother’s diplomatic efforts in 2018. She was the first member of the North’s Kim dynasty to travel to the South for the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in February 2018. She took her place among global dignitaries before conveying to Moon her brother’s desire for a summit.As regional diplomacy has slowed in recent months due to the coronavirus, she has been issuing her first public statements, ridiculing Seoul for protesting a North Korean military drill but praising President Donald Trump for offering to help the North with anti-virus efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-spars-with-neighbour-over-balloons-bringing-in-anti-kim-leaflets/story-TNOKFzxr9d01WXu8CFp3vL.html
04-06-2020||World||PM Modi to hold virtual summit with Australian PM Scott Morrison today||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold India-Australia Virtual Summit with Prime Minister Scott Morrison on Thursday to focus on the positive trajectory in bilateral relations.“Dates for the visit of Prime Minister of Australia to India this year had been finalised, but the visit could not take place. It was also agreed to hold a ‘Virtual Summit’. This is the first time that Prime Minister Modi will be holding a “Bilateral Virtual Summit”, this signifies the strengthening of ties with Australia and its upward trajectory,” Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said in a statement.“The focus would be on the positive trajectory in bilateral relations during discussions between the two Prime Ministers, who have already met on four occasions on the sidelines of multilateral meetings,” sources said.“The virtual summit will be an opportunity for the two leaders to review the broad framework of the relationship in the context of their growing ties. It will also be an opportunity to discuss their respective responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of MoUs and announcements are being discussed by the officials,” they added.Modi and Morrison have met four times during the last one and a half years -- on the sidelines of East Asia Summit in Singapore in November 2018, on the sidelines of G20 in Osaka in June 2019, on the margins of G7 Summit in Biarritz in August 2019 and on the margins of East Asia Summit in Bangkok in November 2019.“India and Australia have very warm and friendly relations. The two nations have much in common, underpinned by shared values of pluralistic, Westminster-style democracies, Commonwealth traditions, the long-standing people-to-people ties and sporting links. Our economies have many complementarities with the potential to enhance bilateral trade and investment,” sources said.The Strategic Partnership between the two countries was strengthened in 2014 - with the visit of Prime Minister Tony Abbott to India in September 2014, and the visit of PM Modi to Australia in November 2014.Framework for Security Cooperation between Australia and India signed in November 2014 during the visit of PM Modi to Australia laid the foundation for intensified foreign, defence and security policy exchanges between the two countries. Since then, regular meetings of the institutional dialogues have been taking place, MEA said.High-level interactions have also continued. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, visited India in April 2017; the Governor-General of Australia visited India in March 2018 to attend the founding Summit of the International Solar Alliance and Rashtrapatiji made a historic visit to Australia in November 2018, MEA said.Due to a better understanding of India’s strength and future role, Australia, in its White Paper on Foreign Policy-2017, recognised India as the “pre-eminent maritime power among Indian Ocean countries” and a “front-rank partner of Australia”.During the last five years, bilateral relations between both countries have strengthened and expanded tremendously. Framework for security cooperation between Australia and India signed in November 2014 during the visit of Modi to Australia laid an action plan on foreign, defence and security policy exchanges and coordination, sources noted.“Several new initiatives and bilateral/trilateral mechanisms such as Foreign Secretaries and Defence Secretaries 2+2 Dialogue, India-Australia-Indonesia Trilateral Dialogue, India-Australia-Japan Trilateral Dialogue have been established since then. These new platforms have provided greater momentum to strengthen our strategic cooperation,” they added.Moreover, economic engagement has been growing. In 2018-19, the trade between the two countries was around USD 21 billion. Australia’s cumulative investment in India is about USD 10.74 billion whereas India’s total investment in Australia is USD 10.45 billion, MEA added.Australia has been supportive of India’s position on cross-border terrorism and on asking Pakistan to take meaningful action against terrorist groups operating from its soil. Australia also co-sponsored UNSC resolution to declare Masood Azhar a global terrorist, sources said.“Australia values India’s diversity and inclusiveness and has held the view that recent developments with regard to Jammu and Kashmir are India’s internal matters,” they added.There is a 700,000 strong Indian diaspora in Australia. There are about 1,06,000 students studying in Australia. Under the Vande Bharat Mission, 1,560 Indian nationals and five OCI cardholders were evacuated from Australia in seven flights in the second phase of the initiative in May this year.The Virtual Summit will be an opportunity for the two leaders to review the broad framework of the relationship, in the context of growing ties between India and Australia, and to discuss their respective responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, MEA said.

04-06-2020||World||‘Facing results of three years of immature leadership’: Mattis rips into Trump||Ex-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis condemned his former boss, President Donald Trump, over his aggressive rhetoric and strategy to quell protests that erupted after the death of an unarmed black man in police custody.“Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people — does not even pretend to try. Instead, he tries to divide us,” Mattis, a retired Marine general, wrote in a scathing statement on Wednesday evening.“We are witnessing the consequences of three years of this deliberate effort. We are witnessing the consequences of three years without mature leadership. We can unite without him, drawing on the strengths inherent in our civil society,” Mattis wrote. “This will not be easy, as the past few days have shown, but we owe it to our fellow citizens; to past generations that bled to defend our promise; and to our children.”The sharply worded and unprecedented rebuke from Trump’s first defense chief will raise pressure on the president, who this week threatened to dispatch active duty troops to quash protests and drew widespread condemnation when the square in front of the White House was forcibly cleared before he walked to a historic church to hold a Bible for photographers.The president responded Wednesday evening saying that he “didn’t like his ‘leadership’ style or much else about” Mattis. “His primary strength was not military, but rather personal public relations,” Trump wrote in one of a pair of tweets.Mattis stepped down 18 months ago after Trump abruptly announced on Twitter that he wanted to pull US troops from Syria, but he was a hugely influential member of the president’s first national security cabinet.Trump was so eager to unveil his nomination of Mattis after the 2016 election that he announced his plans at a campaign-style rally where he introduced the former head of US Central Command by a moniker -- “Mad Dog” -- and called him “one of the most effective generals that we’ve had in many, many decades.”Mattis’s statement, first published in The Atlantic, came on what had already been a rough day for the defense establishment.Trump’s current secretary, Mark Esper, angered White House officials by publicly distancing himself from Trump’s potential use of the 1807 Insurrection Act to deploy active duty forces to cities confronting protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.At a news conference in the afternoon, the president’s press secretary tiptoed around whether Esper’s job was safe, saying only that he remained in his post.While Trump has condemned police for their role in Floyd’s death, he has generally avoided directly responding to demands to address racial injustice and a spate of deaths of black Americans at the hands of police. Instead, he demanded that governors “dominate” the protests to snuff them out and compared himself to Abraham Lincoln, musing that perhaps only Lincoln had done as much for black Americans as he had.It remains to be seen if Mattis’s denunciation will have lasting political power, but it strikes at the heart of what the president has pitched as one of his strengths: His fulsome praise of the military as part of his “America First” approach to the world, even while he frequently accuses the national security establishment of trying to undermine him and his administration.Despite Trump’s praise of Mattis when he took office, by the end of the defense chief’s tenure, their relationship was shattered. Upon his departure, Mattis he issued a blunt resignation letter that amounted to a public reproach of Trump’s “America First” mantra.“We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances,” Mattis wrote. “Because you have the right to have a secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.”Shortly afterward, Trump lashed out at Mattis, saying “What’s he done for me?” Singling out the U.S. quagmire in Afghanistan, Trump added, “How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good.”In his statement this week, Mattis took aim at Esper, too. Without naming the Pentagon chief, but citing the military jargon the Defense secretary and other top officials have used in describing the geography of the current protests, Mattis said, “We must reject any thinking of our cities as a ‘battlespace’ that our uniformed military is called upon to ‘dominate.”’Esper had used the “battlespace” term during a call with governors on Monday, before US authorities used smoke bombs and pepper-spray-like devices to clear out the peaceful protest outside the Whiet House.“We know that we are better than the abuse of executive authority that we witnessed in Lafayette Park. We must reject and hold accountable those in office who would make a mockery of our Constitution,” Mattis wrote.Around the time Mattis’s statement was published, Trump was renewing his threat to send in the military to quash protests, during an interview on Newsmax with Sean Spicer, his former press secretary. He called continuing protests in New York a “disaster.”“And we could help them a lot, they have to ask,”Trump told Spicer. “If they don’t get it straightened out soon, I’ll take care of it.”White House and Pentagon officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on Mattis’s statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facing-results-of-three-years-of-immature-leadership-mattis-rips-into-trump/story-Xvqw9fpmLGWiwOWa79zciJ.html

Two dozen flights will depart from Toronto, while the remaining two will take off from Vancouver.India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria was hopeful that these departures will manage to “accommodate” most of those with “urgent needs” to return to India this month.Also read: 75 more flights to US, Canada in Vande Bharat Phase 3This is the second phase of repatriation flights from Canada under the Modi government’s Vande Bharat Mission. All flights are being operated by Air India.In May, five flights left from Toronto and Vancouver, carrying back 1,343 Indians. This phase, announced by Civil Aviation Minister Hardeep Singh Puri, is part of the 75 flights scheduled from United States and Canada.More cities in India have been added in this phase. While Delhi will remain the hub, passengers will be able to travel to the cities of Chennai, Kolkata, Lucknow and Trivandrum, which did not figure in the May schedule. Those flights connected several other cities including Amritsar, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Jaipur.This will also be the first time that Overseas Citizen of India or OCI card holders in distress will also be able to fly to India since they were not eligible in the month of May. Relaxation of Government rules for OCIs have meant that some may qualify for these flights.As with the initial phase of repatriation, Air India flights departing from India will also be taking registrations from Canadian citizens and permanent residents wishing to return back to Canada. As Puri pointed out earlier, 1,417 flew out of India in the first phase. Air India will start accepting reservations for the Canada-bound flights on June 5.Also read: India adds over 140 flights to West Asian nations in Phase 2 of Vande Bharat MissionBisaria said that nearly 8,000 persons had registered for the repatriation flights on the Indian High Commission’s website and after the first phase, approximately 6,500 remained. These 26 flights should be sufficient to ferry the majority of them. He also pointed out that with the announcement of these flights, there may well be more registration in the days ahead.However, passengers will have to be prepared for the mandatory 14-day quarantine period once they arrive at their destination in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vande-bharat-mission-26-flights-to-depart-from-canada-from-june-9-to-june-30/story-qeOLjdHiYB5QKaCqkrPuKI.html

It follows President Donald Trump’s announcement on Friday of retaliatory measures against Beijing over its tightened grip on Hong Kong.The designations are expected to include China Central Television (CCTV), the top state-owned network, and China News Service, the country’s second-largest state-owned news agency, two sources said on condition of anonymity.They would be added to five Chinese outlets placed under restrictions in February over US allegations they were used by China and its Communist rulers to spread propaganda.Like the others, they will be required to register their employees and US properties with the State Department, similar to rules covering embassies and other diplomatic missions.Though three sources said the announcement was on track for as early as Thursday, a fourth did not rule out a delay.The White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment. There also was no response from the Chinese embassy in Washington.Tensions between Washington and Beijing have spiked, as Trump and his aides have complained about China’s early handling of the coronavirus outbreak and its treatment of Hong Kong, which has enjoyed special US treatment as a global financial center.Chinese state media has been reveling over chaotic race-related protests in the United States and highlighting Trump’s threat to use troops, even as the anniversary looms of its own bloody military crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square 31 years ago.Hong Kong tensionsTrump on Friday ordered his administration to begin the process of eliminating special US treatment for Hong Kong on the grounds it no longer had enough autonomy, but stopped short of calling an immediate end to former British colony’s privileges. China’s state-run Global Times newspaper called Trump’s announcement “recklessly arbitrary.” The United States and China have clashed in recent months over journalists working in each other’s countries.Michael McCaul, top Republican on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, said: “These are Chinese Communist Party propaganda outlets that peddle dangerous information to grow the Party’s power -- not report the news.”In February, the Trump administration said it would treat five major media entities with US operations the same as embassies: Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International, China Daily Distribution Corp. and Hai Tian Development USA, Inc.In March, Washington said it was slashing the number of journalists allowed to work at US offices of major Chinese media outlets to 100 from 160 due to Beijing’s “long-standing intimidation and harassment of journalists.”In response, China said it was revoking accreditations of American correspondents with the New York Times, News Corp’s Wall Street Journal and the Washington Post whose credentials expire by the end of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-impose-restrictions-on-additional-chinese-media-outlets-sources/story-225GqiFMzS0HmgTP9FFW2M.html
04-06-2020||World||Brazil reports record daily Covid-19 deaths as pandemic spreads||Brazil reported a record number of daily deaths from Covid-19 as the pandemic continues to spread in Latin America’s largest nation.The country reported 1,349 new deaths on Wednesday, bringing the number of fatalities to 32,548. It also said it recorded 28,633 new cases in the last 24 hours, pushing the country’s total to 584,016, behind only the USClick here for full Covid-19 coverageThe nation of 210 million people has become an epicenter of the virus, and health experts say the peak of the disease has yet to arrive. Still, after about two months of loosely enforced quarantines, some regions of the country have begun to reopen from lockdowns, including Sao Paulo, which has been the epicenter of cases in the country. On Wednesday, the local government said cases in the state could reach 265,000 by the end of the month, from about 118,000 currently.Contradicting orders from municipal, state and federal leaders have complicated efforts to fight the virus, which has migrated to inland and poorer regions less equipped to deal with the pandemic.The government of President Jair Bolsonaro has resisted social distancing efforts throughout the pandemic, with Bolsonaro often mingling with supporters and pushing for people to get back to work to ease the economic fallout of the crisis. On Wednesday, data showed Brazil’s industrial output fell the most on record in April, adding to historic drops in indicators from formal jobs to broad retail sales that reflect the shutdown from the virus.Also on Wednesday, Rio de Janeiro Governor Wilson Witzel said the state was taking over management of field hospitals being built to help cope with the pandemic. Local media have reported problems ranging from delays to mismanagement in the makeshift structures. Last week Witzel, a political rival of Bolsonaro, had his official residence searched by police and his mobile phones and computers seized as part of an investigation into misuse of funds to fight the coronavirus pandemic.With winter approaching the Southern Hemisphere, the country is entering a period of increased cases of respiratory diseases, further adding to concern that the peak may still be weeks away. The Health Ministry said last week that the curve of cases was still growing, and a report by UBS published Wednesday said that six of Brazil’s 27 states are peaking, while total deaths are increasing in 21 states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-reports-record-daily-covid-19-deaths-as-pandemic-spreads/story-8dNfGAHMXHx05hAygIagVM.html

In line with guidance, he has been tested for coronavirus and is returning home to self-isolate.”While delivering the statement, Sharma, who is also COP26 president, was seen repeatedly wiping his face with a handkerchief, while the shadow business secretary, Ed Miliband, passed him a glass of water.Sharma’s condition brought into focus the new arrangements in the House of Commons, by which MPs who were in self-isolation were no longer allowed to participate or vote remotely but had to be present in person. It led to long queues around the Westminster complex on Tuesday during a vote.Lisa Nandy, shadow foreign secretary, described Sharma’s situation as “just awful”, and added, “The government stopped MPs from working from home and asked us to return to a building where social distancing is impossible. MPs are travelling home to every part of the country tonight. Reckless doesn’t even begin to describe it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-uk-minister-alok-sharma-goes-into-self-isolation/story-E4OIpQKAFSyrbBIBh4QDXL.html

04-06-2020||World||‘Extreme racists throng even to White House’: North Korea on protests in US||North Korea on Thursday said the United States is in no position to criticise China over Hong Kong or human rights when Washington threatens to “unleash dogs” to suppress anti-racism protests at home.In an article carried by one of North Korea’s main state-run newspapers, an unnamed spokesman for the international affairs department of the ruling Workers’ Party of Korea (WPK) criticised recent comments by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.Speaking to Fox News on Sunday, Pompeo said recent actions by the Chinese Communist Party suggest it is “intent upon the destruction of Western ideas, Western democracies, Western values” and “puts Americans at risk.”Pompeo’s remarks on Hong Kong, Taiwan, human rights and trade disputes were “nonsense” that slandered the leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the WPK spokesman said.“Pompeo, who has been deeply engrossed in espionage and plot-breeding against other countries, has become too ignorant to discern where the sun rises and where it sets,” the spokesman said.Such statements by American leaders are a sign of their concerns about a declining United States, he said, citing the ongoing protests against police brutality.“Demonstrators enraged by the extreme racists throng even to the White House,” the spokesman said. “This is the reality in the US today. American liberalism and democracy put the cap of leftist on the demonstrators and threaten to unleash even dogs for suppression.”South Korea’s Yonhap news agency said it was the first time the WPK international affairs department had issued a statement of its own since North Korean leader Kim Jong Un took power in 2011.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extreme-racists-throng-even-to-white-house-north-korea-on-protests-in-us/story-ZYC21OqL0klFWz5pSxIcnJ.html
04-06-2020||World||New York takes ‘step forward’ in restoring order, says Mayor||As protests continued in New York City on Wednesday, officials were hopeful that an earlier curfew and refined police tactics will bring the city closer to restoring order after days of unrest over the death of George Floyd.“Last night we took a step forward in moving out of this difficult period we’ve had the last few days and moving to a better time,” Mayor Bill de Blasio said.Demonstrators marched throughout the city in largely peaceful events, and like the previous night, were still on the streets when the curfew time arrived.At Gracie Mansion, the mayoral residence on Manhattan’s upper east side, demonstrators were kneeling in a moment of silence when alarms rang on cellphones, warning that the curfew time was coming.Lisa Horton, 29, said charges announced Wednesday against three other Minneapolis police officers in connection to Floyd’s death were a step, but she was protesting near the city’s mayoral mansion because she feels much more needs to change.“There’s been progress, but are we at a point where we can all celebrate? No,” the New Yorker said. “It’s going to take radical change” in policing and the criminal justice system, she said.Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who was critical of the police response on prior nights, said the city Tuesday “was much, much better than the night before.”“It worked. We got results,” Cuomo said. “Let’s just remember what we did last night and keep that going.”De Blasio rejected President Donald Trump’s urging and Cuomo’s offer to send in the National Guard to quell the unrest, saying the NYPD was best suited for the task and fearing out-of-town Guardsmen unfamiliar with city dynamics could spark confrontations.Trump warned that if the city didn’t maintain order, he would take the matter into his own hands, though he didn’t say what action he might take.“If they don’t get their act straightened out, I will solve it. I’ll solve it fast,” he said on FOX News Radio’s The Brian Kilmeade Show.Hundreds of protesters were in Manhattan’s Washington Square Park when the charges against the other officers were announced.“It’s not enough,” protester Jonathan Roldan said, contending all four officers should’ve been charged from the start. “Right now, we’re still marching because it’s not enough that they got arrested. There needs to be systematic change.”The curfew, barring people from streets citywide and nonessential vehicles from part of Manhattan from 8 p.m. to 5 a.m., was imposed to prevent the nighttime chaos that followed peaceful protests for several days in a row.Around Manhattan, even in parts of the city that hadn’t seen the damage and thefts, businesses had boarded up windows as precautions.Vandalism and pilfering didn’t stop completely Tuesday. Some shops had windows smashed and merchandise taken. But it was a contrast from the previous two days, when several Manhattan shopping districts and one in the Bronx were overrun with people — some with crowbars and clubs — who ransacked numerous shops and set fires.Moving the curfew from 11 p.m., where it had been Monday, as well as blocking vehicles from entering Manhattan, allowed police to take control of city streets and remove troublemakers, Chief of Department Terence Monahan said.The curfew did not stop political demonstrations over police mistreatment of black Americans. Marchers chanted slogans as they wound through Manhattan and Brooklyn deep into the night Tuesday. The marches were part of a wave of protests across the country since the May 25 death of Floyd, a black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.The nightly curfews will remain in effect at least through Sunday, with the city planning to lift it at the same time it enters the first phase of reopening after more than two months of shutdowns because of the coronavirus.Police said they arrested about 280 people on Tuesday, compared with 700 the previous night. In all, more than 2,000 people have been arrested, the NYPD said.Wednesday, prosecutors also charged a man with shooting at an occupied police vehicle in Queens. Neither officer in the vehicle was wounded. No demonstration was underway in the area and the man’s motive in shooting at the vehicle was unclear.City officials have said, without offering much evidence, that out-of-town agitators have been responsible for the majority of attacks on police officers seen over the last few days and that many involved in removing items from store shelves weren’t protesters, but organized groups that used vehicles to scout locations and remove stolen property.In a tweet Wednesday, Shea claimed “organized looters” had positioned bricks in plastic tubs around the city to use in their crimes. But City Councilman Mark Treyger noted the bricks in the video Shea tweeted were from a construction project far from where any protests or violence had occurred.Shea said some people are “using the protests as cover and then peeling off and unfortunately running around and doing some looting.”De Blasio condemned police for roughing up journalists covering the protests, including two from The Associated Press who were shoved, cursed at and told to go home by officers Tuesday night despite press being considered “essential workers” allowed to be on the streets.“There should be no condition under which any journalist is detained by the police of this city or any city in the United States of America, period,” de Blasio said, calling for an investigation.Shea said officers were “doing the best we can under difficult circumstances,” adding that some people stopped by police lied about being journalists.“Sometimes these things take a second, maybe too long, to sort out,” he said. “We’re not perfect, we do the best we can in a situation.”The police commissioner had planned to appear together with Floyd’s brother Wednesday at a Brooklyn church, but Terrence Floyd decided shortly before the event began that he was too overcome to attend, organizers said. Shea said he’d offered his condolences to Floyd on the phone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-takes-step-forward-in-restoring-order-says-mayor/story-LVahf96xLBcEhSr8JeDo1N.html
04-06-2020||World||Germany agrees $146 billion stimulus package as Europe jobless rise||Germany’s governing parties agreed on a 130 billion euro (USD 146 billion) stimulus package Wednesday to help kick-start the economy, which like others around the world has taken a heavy hit from the coronavirus pandemic.Following 21 hours of talks over two days, Chancellor Angela Merkel said members of her left-right coalition had come up with a “bold response” that would boost consumer spending, invest in innovation and ease the financial strain on families and others.Germany started loosening coronavirus restrictions April 20, about a month after they were introduced, and the easing has gathered pace since. However, the economy went into a recession in the first quarter and the downturn is expected to deepen in the current quarter.Unemployment rose to 6.3% from 5.8% over the past month, a figure that would have been significantly higher had it not been for a government program that allowed companies to cut back the hours and wages of more than 7 million employees in return for keeping them on.“It’s clear that all of this requires a bold response,” Merkel told reporters in Berlin. “It’s about securing jobs, keeping the economy running or getting it going again.” The stimulus package will see the main value-added tax rate cut from 19% to 16% and the reduced rate from 7% to 5% for six months, starting July 1.Debt-laden municipalities will receive financial aid from the federal government, which will shoulder 120 billion euros of the overall package covering the years 2020 and 2021.And families will receive a 300 euro payment per child, with further support for single parents.Among dozens of other measures, the government will extend aid to sectors that have been particularly badly hit by the pandemic, increase financial incentives for electric and hybrid vehicles, fund the expansion of childcare facilities and see greater government investments in areas such as renewable energy storage, quantum computing and digitalization.Germany already is offering a total of more than 1 trillion euros in aid via various packages, which include money to tide small companies and individual entrepreneurs through virus-related closures and to pump capital into bigger companies where needed.The crisis has derailed the government’s dedication to keeping its budget balanced, long a point of pride. After six years in the black, it is borrowing 156 billion euros to finance the existing rescue packages and cover an expected shortfall in tax revenue.Olaf Scholz, the country’s finance minister, said Germany could afford to increase government spending “because we’ve been financially prudent in recent years and can draw on savings.” Asked whether there was a danger that Germany’s notoriously frugal consumers might take the government’s stimulus measures as an opportunity to buy a cheaper French car, Merkel said: “We have an interest in Germany being strong, but in particular that Europe is also strong overall.” Germany is heavily reliant on exports and a pullback by its main trading partners could hurt the economy badly.New figures released Wednesday by the statistics agency Eurostat showed the jobless rate in the 19 countries that use the euro rose to 7.3% in April, the first full month when pandemic lockdowns hit the continent, from 7.1% in March.Europe’s rise in unemployment has been moderate by international standards because employers are making extensive use of government-backed short-time work programs, which allow them to keep employees on the payroll while they await better times.In Germany, Europe’s largest economy, the federal labor agency pays at least 60% of the salary of employees who are on reduced or zero hours.In the United States, which has fewer automatic furlough programs than Europe, the jobless rate has rocketed to almost 15% from 4% before the crisis, and new figures due Friday are expected to show a further increase to nearly 20% in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-agrees-146-billion-stimulus-package-as-europe-jobless-rise/story-blSbLPwpFU56JIaYMStkbK.html
04-06-2020||World||US defense chief opposes deploying troops to quell protests||US Defense Secretary Mark Esper said on Wednesday he does not support invoking the Insurrection Act to deploy active-duty forces to quell civil unrest for now, despite President Donald Trump’s threats to militarize America’s response to mass protests.Trump said this week he could use military forces in states that fail to crack down on sometimes violent protests over the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis.“The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most urgent and dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now,” Esper told a news briefing.“I do not support invoking the Insurrection Act.”Former Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who had long refused to criticize a sitting president explicitly, on Wednesday accused Trump of trying to divide America and roundly denounced a militarization of the US response to civil unrest.Esper’s news conference did not go over well with either the president or his top aides, an administration official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.To deploy the military on US soil for law enforcement purposes, Trump would need to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act - something last done in 1992 in response to the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.The military has pre-positioned 1,600 active duty forces on the outskirts of Washington, D.C., to deploy if needed.A US official said that the Army on Wednesday had been told of a decision to send some of the active duty troops back to their home base, but Esper reversed course following a meeting at the White House and discussions at the Pentagon. Esper said he regretted using the term “battlespace” this week to describe areas gripped by protests.“In retrospect, I would use different wording so as not to distract from the more important matters at hand or allow some to suggest that we are militarizing the issue,” he said. Trump’s threats to deploy active duty troops -- even in states that oppose its use to address civil unrest -- has stirred alarm within the US military and in Congress, where a top Republican warned it could easily make troops “political pawns.”Esper said he was unaware that he would be part of Trump’s politically charged photo opportunity on Monday, when law enforcement forcibly cleared a park outside the White House of peaceful protesters so that the president could take a picture in front of a church holding a Bible. Mattis, a retired Marine general who denies political ambitions, also took a swipe at current US military leadership for participating in the Monday photo-op and criticized use of the word “battlespace” by Esper and Army General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.In his press conference earlier, Esper acknowledged the difficulty of deploying the military without entering the political fray.“I work very hard to keep the department out of politics, which is very hard these days as we move closer and closer to an election,” Esper said.Retired Navy Admiral Mike Mullen, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he was “sickened” to see how law enforcement -- including the National Guard -- had cleared the area and warned against over-use of the US military.“Our fellow citizens are not the enemy, and must never become so,” Mullen wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defense-chief-opposes-deploying-troops-to-quell-protests-despite-trump-threats/story-LTBlnXBFoCpRPPcEQ1SujO.html
04-06-2020||World||‘Trump completed hydroxychloroquine regimen safely’: White House medical team||The White House medical team kept a close eye on President Donald Trump’s heart rhythms, including at least one electrocardiogram, to watch for potential side effects when he took a two-week course of a malaria drug to try to prevent the coronavirus, his doctor reported Wednesday.“The President completed the regimen safely and without side effects,” Dr. Sean Conley wrote in a report on Trump’s latest physical and his treatment with hydroxychloroquine.Overall, Conley said, Trump showed little change in basic health measurements from 16 months ago. On the negative side, he gained a pound. But on the plus side, his cholesterol level continued to fall.“The data indicates the President remains healthy,” Conley concluded.Trump recently took a two-week course of hydroxychloroquine after two White House staffers tested positive for Covid-19.Conley said it was done in consultation with “appropriate care team members and close monitoring of the electrocardiogram (EKG),” indicating that doctors were looking for changes in his heartbeat because abnormal heart rhythms are one of the dangerous side effects that have been found in studies of the drug.The drug proved ineffective for preventing Covid-19 in the first large, high-quality study to test it in people in close contact with someone with the disease. Results published Wednesday by the New England Journal of Medicine show that hydroxychloroquine was no better than placebo pills at preventing illness from the coronavirus. The drug did not seem to cause serious harm, though -- about 40% on it had side effects, mostly mild stomach problems.Trump has frequently has cited anecdotal reports and seemed determined to prove the naysayers wrong.Trump’s weight came in a 244 pounds. That gives him a Body Mass Index of 30.5, based on his 6-foot, 3-inch frame. An index rating of 30 is the level at which doctors consider someone to be obese. About 40 percent of Americans are obese.Trump was evaluated twice for the physical, first in November 2019 and then in April. He has a resting heart rate of 63 beats per minute. A normal resting heart rate for adults ranges from 60 to 100 beats per minute, and generally, a lower rate implies better cardiovascular fitness.His blood pressure came in at 121 over 79. The American Heart Association says an elevated blood pressure range is when a reading for the upper number consistently ranges from 120-129 and less than 80 for the lower number. People with elevated blood pressure are likely to develop high blood pressure unless steps are taken to control the condition.Trump has shown marked improvement in his cholesterol levels during his presidency, helped by medication. At his physical in January 2018, his total cholesterol was 223. In early 2019, the reading came in at 196. It now stands at 167. The president takes Rosuvastatin to help lower his bad cholesterol, known as LDL, and to raise his good cholesterol, or HDL. Ideally, total cholesterol should be less than 200.Trump also takes aspirin daily and Finasteride, a drug to treat enlargement of the prostate and male pattern hair loss. Aspirin reduces the risk of heart attack and stroke in people at high risk for them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-completed-hydroxychloroquine-regimen-safely-white-house-medical-team/story-DDlKJk5ZZf6K8KS5dl0S4L.html
04-06-2020||World||Police chokeholds being scrutinised around the world||Three days after George Floyd died with a Minneapolis police officer choking off his air, another black man writhed on the tarmac of a street in Paris as a police officer pressed a knee to his neck during an arrest.Immobilisation techniques where officers apply pressure with their knees on prone suspects are used in policing around the world and have long drawn criticism. One reason why Floyd’s death is sparking anger globally is that such techniques have been blamed for asphyxiations and other deaths in police custody beyond American shores, often involving non-white suspects. “We cannot say that the American situation is foreign to us,” said French lawmaker Francois Ruffin, who has pushed for a ban on the police use of face-down holds that are implicated in multiple deaths in France, a parliamentary effort put on hold by the coronavirus pandemic. The muscular arrest on May 28 in Paris of a black man who was momentarily immobilised face-up with an officer’s knee and upper shin pressing down on his jaw, neck and upper chest is among those that have drawn angry comparisons with the killing of Floyd.In Hong Kong, where police behaviour is a hot-button issue after months of anti-government protests, the city’s force says it is investigating the death of a man who was immobilised face-down during his arrest in May by officers who were filmed kneeling on his shoulder, back and neck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-chokeholds-being-scrutinised-around-the-world/story-kOuJ5JJWdBO7Wc9NhQGNWJ.html

She said China was compelled to take the step at the national level because of the opposition in Hong Kong legislature.On Wednesday, a spokesperson from the EU said Hong Kong people must be free to mark the Tiananmen Square crackdown anniversary, which police had banned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-plan-to-give-sanctuary-to-hk-citizens-angers-china/story-YylOnR0CkIVAzpVjtDUjTI.html

04-06-2020||World||One face in the crowd: A protester haunted by the dead||She couldn’t eat and she couldn’t sleep, jolting awake an hour after going to bed. Kelly Bundy felt haunted by the people who died by police bullets, or had an officer’s knee on their neck.She could hear her grandmother screaming when police gunned down their family friend, 19-year-old Michael Newby, in a 2004 killing that scarred this city. That was 16 years ago, but suddenly it felt like yesterday, and like nothing had changed since. The list has only grown, in Louisville and beyond: Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Freddie Gray, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd.“It’s almost if I’m being haunted by them because I’m not doing enough,” Bundy said, so she got out of bed after two hours of sleep and headed out to the streets for her third day of protest.The unrest has engulfed cities across America in honor of George Floyd, who died after an officer pressed his knee into in his neck while he pleaded for air in Minnesota; Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old EMT who was shot in Louisville by detectives knocking down her door in the middle of the night; and other African Americans. Tens of thousands of people protest nightly, in dozens of cities and towns, touching every state. They raise signs, chant for justice, and repeat the names of those lost.Much of the focus has been on burning buildings and police cruisers, smashed windows, fireworks tossed at officers. Bundy and her friends say they know the truth: Most protesters are peaceful people like them, who feel called to duty after a lifetime of inequality, the everyday indignities of racism, the enduring fear of police aggression.In every crowd, like this one of thousands packed into a downtown square, there are gig workers like Bundy, who bartends, delivers groceries, and hosts a radio show; there are nurses and lawyers, pastors, a fashion designer, a model, a comedian, an employee of the mayor’s office.Louisville police, like others, have dispersed crowds with tear gas and pelted protesters with pepper balls. Military vehicles block streets, and officers in riot gear with batons break up demonstrations at dusk. Helicopters circle overhead. Early Monday morning, a new round of fiery resistance ignited in Louisville, when David McAtee, the owner of a barbecue restaurant, was killed while police and National Guard soldiers were enforcing a curfew.On Monday morning, Bundy, 30, and her friends packed cases of water and snacks to distribute to fellow demonstrators; they brought a first aid kit and milk to pour into the eyes of people tear gassed. Authorities keep telling everyone to go home and be safe. But Breonna Taylor was shot in her own home, Bundy said, so that doesn’t make much sense: “I could get killed at home because of the color of my skin. Where are we safe? What difference does it make, being out here or going home?”The recent unrest is the most acrimonious confrontation between police and protesters here since the 2004 killing of Newby, who was shot in the back by Officer McKenzie Mattingly. Mattingly was fired and indicted, then acquitted by a jury.Bundy was 13, and she recalls her grandmother flipping on the news, hearing the name of the dead young man and wailing. Bundy’s grandmother’s best friend was Newby’s mother. The phone started ringing. “They killed our boy,” the callers cried.“I thought to myself, ‘He’s black, I’m black, it could happen to me, too,” she said.Today, many Louisville protesters say the Newby killing turned them into activists. It was the day Bundy saw clearly how America would work against her all her life.There are the everyday injustices: impoverished neighborhoods, lack of health care, underperforming schools. Then there’s the overzealous policing: When she was 17, she said, she was leaving a nightclub with friends, and a group of white women taunted them about their clothes, how they shouldn’t be in the neighborhood. Officers arrived, and they assumed the young black women were the aggressors. One slammed her to the ground, Bundy said. Most black people she knows have some experience like this, and it feels to her now like that anger is irrevocably boiling over.The protests have been traumatizing, and she thinks she’ll cope with that the rest of her life. The first day, she was terrified. Her family begged her not to go: “You’re going to get killed, your name will be the next hashtag.” She didn’t even get out of her car. But she couldn’t get the sound of her grandmother screaming out of her head. She couldn’t eat, or drink, or sleep.She went back the next day. She got tear gassed just as she stepped out of her car, she said, and a friend poured milk in her eyes. She watched officers fire nonlethal projectiles at her friends. She thought of her three children, and wondered whether one day they’d have to go through this, too, like her parents and grandparents and now her.“That made me want to go even harder,” she said. “They’re not going to silence me. They’re not going to stop me.”The next day, she stood in the front of the crowd, holding a sign high: “George Floyd.” She led hundreds as they marched, stopping traffic. Most cars honked, and drivers thrust their fists in the air in solidarity. A group of officers met them in the city square, and some demonstrators hugged them. Bundy did not. She said she wasn’t ready yet.As the sun set, the clock ticked toward curfew and police in riot gear lined up a block way, she headed home, with plans to return again in the daylight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/one-face-in-the-crowd-a-protester-haunted-by-the-dead/story-V31aJyA8DCClW3dN1tPcoJ.html
04-06-2020||World||US protests more peaceful, defense secretary breaks with president||An eight-feet tall fence greeted protestors at the White House Tuesday, aimed at keeping them further away from the seat of American power, but it failed to deter them from showing up in even larger numbers. They stayed late, chanting slogans and singing, in defiance of night-time curfew.Protestors in New York city also stayed on the streets till late in clear violation of a night-time curfew that started earlier that before. They had been largely peaceful but as it got late into the night, looting and violence broke out sporadically, but not on the scale seen the previous night.More than two dozen American cities such as Washington DC, New York City, Los Angeles were under various durations of curfew as protests and demonstrations continued across the United States in support of justice and against persisting racism, triggered by the death of George Floyd, an African unarmed American man, in police custody in Minneapolis last week.“I want justice for him because he was good, no matter what anybody thinks,” Roxie Washington, the mother of Floyd’s six-year-old daughter, told told reporters at a press conference in Minneapolis on Tuesday, breaking down uncontrollably at time.s. “He was good and this is the proof that he was a good man,” she added, pointing at their daughter Gianna.Protests at the White House and the Trump administration’s overwhelming response to them, with implications for the rest of the country, have come under special scrutiny. Specially in the light of the action taken by law enforcement agencies to clear a park teeming with protestors Monday to make way for the president to walk to a nearby stage with an entourage of cabinet members and senior officials to stage a photo-op.US defense secretary Mark Esper on Wednesday sought to further clear his role in this incident and the use of US military reservists of the National Guard by the Trump administration to quell the violence accompanying the protests in some parts with a strategy to “dominate” the streets.“I don’t support invoking the Insurrection Act,” Esper said in first public comments, referring to a 200-year-old law the president has sought to invoke to deploy active-duty troops against the protests. He added, in a significant break with the president, “The option to use active-duty forces in a law enforcement role should only be used as a matter of last resort and only in the most ... dire of situations. We are not in one of those situations now.”But on Tuesday, the Pentagon moved 1,600 additional troops to the Washington DC area. But it stressed, in a statement from the the spokesman, ”Active duty elements are postured on military bases in the National Capitol Region but are not in Washington, DC. They are on heightened alert status but remain under Title X authority and are not participating in defense support to civil authority operations.”US military police personnel have been standing by deployment in New York, at the request of local officials, who have so far not only held off on calling in either them or the National Guard reservists, despite repeated public calls from the president, a former New Yorker .New York city fared much better Tuesday than the night before . “So far, the curfew is certainly helping, based on everything I’ve seen in Brooklyn and Manhattan over the last three hours,” he wrote on twitter late int he evening. But some disturbances were reported after, once again, nothing comparable the previous day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-protests-more-peaceful-defense-secretary-breaks-with-president/story-nopGvE4qBFlq8rrr1TBOmK.html
04-06-2020||World||First 100 ventilators donated to India to be shipped next week: Donald Trump||The United States expects to ship the first tranche of 100 ventilators, out of 200 machines it plans to donate to India, by next week, President Donald Trump told Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a phone conversation. Trump had first announced the plan to donate the ventilators through a tweet on May 16, when he said the two sides were also working on developing a vaccine for Covid-19. The donation of the ventilators figured during President Trump’s phone call to PM Modi on Tuesday, and the president said he was “happy to announce that the US would be ready to ship the first tranche of 100 donated ventilators to India next week,” according to a White House pool report. The two leaders also discussed the upcoming G7 Summit in September, the Covid-19 response of the two countries and regional security issues. President Trump invited PM Modi to attend the G7 Summit. Ramona El Hamzaoui, acting director of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) in India, had told reporters last month: “This is a donation. The US government plans to donate 200 ventilators to India.”She added, “USAID, on behalf of the US and through the generosity of the American people…is providing access to medical supplies and ventilators to India and other countries.”USAID has been working with India’s health ministry, the Indian Red Cross Society and other stakeholders in both countries to assist in the delivery, transportation and placement of the ventilators.The US government, private companies, and non-profit and academic organisations have shared their expertise with partner countries such as India on the production of ventilators and other equipment.USAID has so far announced $5.9 million in funding for India to combat Covid-19, including $2.9 million to provide care to the affected, disseminate information, contact tracing and surveillance, and $3 million to support a financing facility that can mobilise private sector resources to assist more than 20,000 health facilities enrolled under India’s health insurance scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-100-ventilators-donated-to-india-to-be-shipped-next-week-donald-trump/story-MyKjtJbMxelySngXiyMRHI.html

04-06-2020||World||Over 2,700 arrests since George Floyd protests in Los Angeles: Police chief||More than 2,700 people have been arrested since protests and violence began in Los Angeles in response to the death of George Floyd.Chief Michel Moore told the city Police Commission on Tuesday that about 2,500 of those arrests were for failure to disperse or curfew violations.The remainder were for crimes including burglary, looting, assaults on police officers and other violence, chief told the panel, which functions as the Police Department’s civilian oversight board.A huge new demonstration filled streets in the Hollywood area, with police and National Guard troops on scene.Earlier, police officers took a knee with clergy-led demonstrators near the downtown police headquarters where speakers urged everyone to heed the call of Floyd’s family for people to protest peacefully.Other major cities including San Francisco and San Diego also were calm.Los Angeles County, however, announced its 10 million residents would again be under curfew starting at 6 pm. Other jurisdictions around the state also renewed curfews.The full impact of curfews on the ability to police downtown Los Angeles and other areas of the city was evident by Sunday night, Moore said on Monday.Violence and thefts on Monday were not on the scale of the weekend, when blocks of stores were devastated, police cars torched and officers injured.In Sacramento, where two-thirds of downtown businesses were damaged over the weekend, 500 National Guard troops were deployed and the city imposed a Monday night curfew.Most demonstrations were peaceful and sympathy was expressed by law enforcement. Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco took a knee at the invitation of demonstrators.“We support and will protect those who wish to demonstrate peacefully,” U.S. Attorney Nick Hanna in Los Angeles said while announcing the FBI will help identify people who commit serious crimes.San Diego Police Chief David Nisleit said Floyd’s death prompted him to revisit department policy and stop the use of a controversial neck restraint method. Floyd, who was black, was handcuffed and on the ground pleading for air as a white police officer pressed a knee on his neck for several minutes.Most of Monday’s demonstrations ended when curfews took effect. But remaining crowds tossed fireworks and bottles in several cities, and authorities responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.Police who had been overwhelmed during the weekend were reinforced by 4,500 National Guard troops.“Don’t be dumb,” Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti warned before the night’s curfew went into effect.Even so, scattered attacks on stores threatened to overshadow the message of protesters. Televised images showed attacks on stores in Van Nuys and Hollywood. Police said some people carried hammers.At one point, a handful of protesters stopped would-be thieves from entering a Walgreens on Sunset Boulevard.Many of the trashed businesses had only recently reopened after closures due to the coronavirus. Volunteers turned out to help merchants clean up broken glass, board up storefronts and scrub away graffiti.Alex Rose clutched a garbage-picker as he joined others cleaning up downtown Sacramento.“There’s a very clear distinction between protesters and the looters,” said Rose, who protested during the day Sunday. “I went home last night, and that’s when the criminals came out.”Some leaders blamed outsiders for the violence.Oakland’s acting police chief said organized thieves travelled more than 100 miles (160 kilometers) from other cities.“Fifteen, 20, 30 cars at a time, hitting as you’ve seen different shopping malls, different areas,” Chief Susan Manheimer said.San Francisco Police Chief Bill Scott said some people “came to this city with crowbars, bolt cutters, tools that were designed specifically to get into businesses, to take property and loot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-2-700-arrests-since-george-floyd-protests-in-los-angeles-police-chief/story-RHyyC5ZT1jtclAoST8D5PM.html
04-06-2020||World||Thousands set to attend George Floyd march in Houston||Thousands of people are expected to participate in a citywide march here on Tuesday to express outrage over the death of African-American George Floyd and offer solidarity with his grieving family.Floyd, a 46-year-old restaurant worker from Houston, died in Minneapolis on Monday after a white police officer pinned him to the ground. Video footage showed the officer kneeling on Floyd’s neck as he gasped for breath, sparking widespread protests across the US. On Monday, an official postmortem declared Floyd’s death a homicide.The organisers of the march and Houston police expect a huge turnout on Tuesday and hope things remain peaceful.“Downtown should look like the Astros parade tomorrow (Tuesday),” said rapper and activist Trae tha Truth, a friend of Floyd, who is among the organisers of the march.Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner encouraged people to wear masks and social distance as much as possible. He also asked them to continue to be respectful.“This is a salute to George and an acknowledgment that he should not have died the way he did,” Turner said. “I hope people will honour George and not deface his name and his memory,” the mayor said.“I expect the march on Tuesday to be peaceful and respectful with the focus on George Floyd and his family,” he said during a press conference on Monday.Two prominent Houston rappers, Trae Tha Truth and Bun B, Mayor Sylvester Turner and Police Chief Art Acevedo will join the family of Floyd, in a march on Tuesday afternoon starting at downtown’s Discovery Green and ending at the City Hall.Turner stressed protesters should wear face coverings, bring hand sanitisers or gloves and remain six feet from others if at all possible.“For everyone that is going to be engaged in those crowds...you need to mask up and be respectful of not just yourself but of others.” Turner said the city has increased its law enforcement presence in preparation of Tuesday’s march and is “ramping up” for a large crowd.With the exception of some rioting, looting and over 400 arrests during the weekend protests, Turner said Houston protests have remained somewhat peaceful.“Houston has helped set an example for protests across the nation,” Turner said. “Police have made some arrests...but things have not gotten out of hand.” He also thanked the Houston police for their professionalism and firefighters for the support they have given being on the front lines. Turner said he gives a lot of credit to Trae tha Truth and Bun B for organising peaceful events and their efforts.“This is a salute to Floyd and an acknowledgment that he should have not died the way he did. This is our home and this is Floyd home,” he said.Meanwhile, the funeral of Floyd will take place in his hometown Houston on June 9 which is expected to be attended by thousands and will include a police escort. According to the media reports, legendary boxer, Floyd Mayweather, 43, will pay for George Floyd’s funeral services.Fort Bend Memorial Planning Center sources confirmed that Floyd’s family has accepted Mayweather’s offer to pay for the services.The Floyd family announced earlier on Monday that there will be services held in Minneapolis, North Carolina and Houston.The funeral arrangements for Floyd were announced on Monday at a news conference, where representatives for the Floyd family revealed the results of a private autopsy, which found that Floyd’s death while in police custody was a homicide.His death, the autopsy concluded, was caused by asphyxia from neck and back pressure that led to a lack of blood flow to the brain.Police chief Acevedo, who has marched with demonstrators and changed the Houston Police Department’s Twitter profile picture to an image of Floyd and the hashtag #JusticeForFloyd, said he offered to have his officers escort the body.“We’ve reached out to the family,” Chief Acevedo said and depending on their plans, if they need help with the movement of the body, we’ve offered to provide that security.” Governor Greg Abbott has issued a State of Disaster for all Texas counties “in the midst of violent protests that endanger public safety and threaten property loss and damage.” Under the declaration, Abbott can designate federal agents to serve as state peace officers.Major Texas cities including Houston, Dallas, Austin, and San Antonio were rocked by protests and demonstrations. As Dallas reports, the city enacted an overnight curfew in the central Dallas area that was in effect from May 31 through 6 am June 1.“Every Texan and every American has the right to protest and I encourage all Texans to exercise their First Amendment rights,” said Abbott, in the statement. “However, violence against others and the destruction of property is unacceptable and counterproductive. As protests have turned violent in various areas across the state, it is crucial that we maintain order, uphold public safety, and protect against property damage or loss,” he said.“By authorising additional federal agents to serve as Texas Peace Officers we will help protect people’s safety while ensuring that peaceful protesters can continue to make their voices heard,” he added.

04-06-2020||World||Keep your mouth shut: Houston police chief tells Trump over George Floyd protests||The police of the Houston city in the US state of Texas has advice for President Donald Trump after his comments to governors following the murder of an African American at the hands of a police officer in Minneapolis, Minnesota.Houston Police chief Art Acevedo’s reaction came after Trump, who last week tweeted “when the looting starts, the shooting starts,” urged governors to get tough on the violent protests following the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, in police custody in Minneapolis. A white officer has been charged and three others fired.Widespread protests have raged all over the United States following George Floyd’s death on May 25, starting with Minneapolis. Protesters have attacked and vandalised stores as well as police property.“Let me just say this to the President of the United States, on behalf of the police chiefs of this country: Please, if you don’t have something constructive to say, keep your mouth shut,” Acevedo said while peaking to CNN’s Christiane Amanpour.President Donald Trump in a video conference call with governors on Monday had called them “weak” for not being able to control the growing nationwide protests over the death of George Floyd, suggesting that they use the National Guard to “dominate” protesters.Trump also praised the National Guard response in Minneapolis, saying it “cut through [protesters] like butter” while calling on state leaders to adopt more brutal tactics to put down the uprisings.“You have to dominate. If you don’t dominate, you’re wasting your time. They’re going to run over you. You’re going to look like a bunch of jerks. You have to dominate,” Trump said on the call, according to reports.Acevedo also accusing Trump of putting men and women in their early 20s at risk.“This is not about dominating. It is about winning hearts and minds. And let’s be clear, we do not want to confuse kindness with weakness. We don’t want ignorance to ruin what we have managed to do to restore normalcy,” the Houston Police chief said.Acevedo quoted from the Hollywood film Forrest Gump, saying “if you don’t have anything to say, don’t say it.”“Because that’s the basic tenet of leadership and we need leadership now more than ever.. and it’s time to be presidential and not try to be like on The Apprentice. This is not Hollywood, this is real life and real lives at risk,” he said, referring to the popular reality show that starred Trump.Floyd, who was in handcuffs at the time, died after police officer Derek Chauvin ignored bystander shouts to get off Floyd and Floyd’s cries that he couldn’t breathe. The Minneapolis police officer was charged last week with third-degree murder in Floyd’s death, and three other officers were fired. Bystander video showed Chauvin holding his knee on Floyd’s neck despite the man’s cries that he can’t breathe until he eventually stopped moving.A medical examiner on Monday classified Floyd’s death as a homicide, saying his heart stopped as police restrained him and compressed his neck, in a widely seen video that has sparked protests across the US.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/please-keep-your-mouth-shut-houston-police-chief-tells-us-president-trump-over-george-floyd-protests/story-SzvQ88N7627HxEADlNmczN.html
