Quakes of such size can be devastating.The earthquake was centered in the southern state of Oaxaca, the Mexican institute said.Reuters witnesses in Mexico City saw no initial signs of injuries or damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-7-7-earthquake-shakes-mexico/story-Uuzq57YchCCHl9EC0IzNqM.html
23-06-2020||World||China has an ‘obligation’ to join nuclear arms talks: US||Beijing has an “obligation” to join Washington and Moscow at negotiations to replace a nuclear disarmament treaty, the United States said Tuesday, a day after talks with Russia in Vienna.“They (China) have an obligation to negotiate in good faith with us and the Russians,” American envoy to the negotiations Marshall Billingslea told reporters.“They stood up not just the United States and Russia but they stood up the entire world,” he said.On Monday American and Russian delegations met in Vienna to discuss the New START treaty, which limits each side to 1,550 deployed nuclear warheads but which is due to run out in February.US President Donald Trump has insisted China should be involved in the talks, but Beijing has shown no interest in taking part.Billingslea said another round of negotiations could take place towards the end of July but admitted it could once again be restricted to Washington and Moscow and didn’t rule out an extension of the bilateral accord.“The Russian Federation did not agree with my request to pressure China to join as a responsible party into these talks, but they also... are not opposed to China joining,” Billingslea said.However, on Tuesday the Russian envoy to the talks Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said it was “unrealistic to count on China’s participation”.Billingslea said the American delegation “had the opportunity to spend a great deal of time presenting detailed intelligence -- the first time in fact in recent memory that we have done so with Russia -- regarding... the destabilising and worrisome crash programmes of third parties,” Billingslea said, in another oblique reference to China.He said that the US delegation had been left with the “clear impression” that Russia would favour a multilateral format that would include European nuclear powers France and the United Kingdom.The US would not rule out this prospect, Billingslea said, but stressed that “the United Kingdom and France are in a very different situation than the arms-racing Chinese”.He also confirmed that the US delegation had put out Chinese flags in the negotiating room before the Russian delegation arrived.Shortly before talks started on Monday, Billingslea tweeted a picture of an empty negotiating table decked with Chinese flags, prompting a scornful reaction from Chinese diplomats.Experts say the Trump administration’s insistence that China should be a part of the talks casts doubt on whether it is serious about reaching an accord.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-has-an-obligation-to-join-nuclear-arms-talks-us/story-NkBdWwRMsi7KqPWI8DMJWL.html
23-06-2020||World||After dwindling infections, UK PM Boris eases coronavirus lockdown from July 4||Keen to kick-start economy crippled by the lockdown, Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday announced a reduction of the 2-metre social distancing rule, allowing restaurants, museums, pubs and galleries to re-open with some curbs, but experts advised caution.The relaxation from July 4, seen as a high-stakes moment, applies only to England, with separate announcements for Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales in early July. The UK – the worst affected European country with over 42,000 deaths – has recorded dwindling numbers of infections in recent days.The development was welcomed by Labour as Johnson told the House of Commons: “Today, we can say that our long national hibernation is beginning to come to an end and life is returning to our shops, streets and homes and a new, but cautious, optimism is palpable”.“But it would be all too easy for that frost to return and that is why we will continue to trust in the common sense and the community spirit of the British people to follow this guidance, to carry us through and see us to victory over this virus”.“Thanks to our progress, we can now go further and safely ease the lockdown in England. At every stage, caution will remain our watchword, and each step will be conditional and reversible…Almost as eagerly awaited as a pint will be a haircut, particularly by me, and so we will re-open hairdressers, with appropriate precautions, including the use of visors”.World Health Organisation expert Margaret Harris advised caution: “The lesson is for people to understand this is the year of living differently. Not, ‘OK, it’s over’. You haven’t just been let out of school. You have done well. You have really brought down your numbers”.“The UK has brought a very difficult outbreak right down. Very good news in the last couple of days about the limitation in cases, and far, far fewer people dying. So, now is the moment to celebrate that by being super-careful”, she told BBC.David King, former chief scientific adviser, added that easing the lockdown is “far too early…far too premature…extremely risky” because the UK still does not have an operational ‘test and trace’ system. He feared a spike in the number of cases in the near future.The reduction of 2-metre distancing rule to 1-metre enables the hospitality industry and other sectors to re-open with some curbs but it is uncertain if the people will immediately flock to pubs, cinemas, restaurants and other venues. Concern and caution over the virus remain.Setting out figures behind the relaxation, Johnson said that in the first half of May, nearly 69,000 people tested positive for Covid-19 across the UK; by the first half of June, that total had fallen by nearly 70 percent to just under 22,000.“The number of new infections is now declining by between 2 and 4 percent every day. Four weeks ago, an average of 1 in 400 people in the community in England had Covid-19; in the first half of June, this figure was 1 in 1,700”, he said.On May 11, 1,073 people were admitted to hospital in England, Wales and Northern Ireland; by June 20, this had fallen by 74 per cent to 283. Measured by a seven-day rolling average, the number of daily deaths peaked at 943 on April 14; on May 11 it was 476; and on Monday, the rolling average stood at 130.Johnson added: “And while we remain vigilant, we do not believe there is currently a risk of a second peak of infections that might overwhelm the National Health Service”. “Taking everything together, we continue to meet our five tests and the Chief Medical Officers of all four home nations have downgraded the UK’s Covid Alert Level from four to three, meaning that we no longer face a virus spreading exponentially, though it remains in general circulation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-dwindling-infections-uk-pm-boris-eases-coronavirus-lockdown-from-july-4/story-TDLvwoQEoro3ckFQUyj1xM.html
23-06-2020||World||Imran Khan’s anti-graft crusade hits the glass ceiling. It is Made in China||For those who remember the memorable courtroom scene from the Tom Cruise blockbuster, “A few good men”, in which Jack Nicholson, in a moment of extreme provocation, exclaims “you can’t handle the truth’, the situation in Pakistan today is a grim reminder of the opacity with which the deep state operates to protect its interests. Even Imran Khan, the poster boy of the establishment, didn’t realise how deeply vested the interests of the Army are in the matters of the State when he decided to move his crusade against corruption to the next level by going after entrenched businesses. The initial euphoria around the leaked report on the modus operandi of the independent power producers in April suddenly evaporated even as the government and the NAB continued to relentlessly hound the opposition and some of its own allies on the sugar and other scams. What was different about the power sector scam that the government was forced to suppress the report?Imran Khan is not new to taking embarrassing U-turns on the diktat of his mentors. His hopes of scoring a diplomatic coup were dashed late last year when he was made to cancel his participation at the Kuala Lumpur Summit in view of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi’s sensitivities. The suppression of the power sector report also reeks of a similar intervention. After all, the report had unambiguously exposed the extreme profiteering built into the contracts with the Independent Power Producer, or IPPs, two of who happened to be Chinese companies under the glorified flagship China–Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC extravaganza.Commenting on the two CPEC projects, Sahiwal and Port Qasim coal plants, the IPP report revealed that “excess set-up cost of Rs 32.46 billion was allowed to the two coal-based plants due to misrepresentation by sponsors regarding Interest During Construction, or IDC as well as non-consideration of earlier completion of plants...”.IDC was allowed for 48 months whereas the plants were completed within 27-29 months leading to entitlement of an excess Return on Equity (RoE) of $ 2.7 million annually over the entire project life of 30 years in the case of the Sahiwal plant, also known as Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pak) Energy or HSR. The estimated excess payment keeping in mind a 6 percent annual rupee depreciation against the dollar works out to a whopping Rs 291.04 billion.The report further revealed the underhand nature of HSR’s financial misrepresentations by brazenly claiming IDC based on markup on long term loan at the London InterBank Offered Rate, the benchmark interest rate at which major global lend to one another in the international interbank market for short-term loan, + 4.5 per cent during the entire construction period despite the Chinese company not borrowing any funds during the first year of construction and only short term loans at substantially lower interest rates during the second year.The proceeds of profiteering are way too large for the common mind to have been missed as oversight. The complicity of government authorities in negotiating such profitable deals for the Chinese is the unwritten corollary to the report.For just two projects that were examined, the report found over payment of Rs 484.84 billion or approximately $ 3 billion. Official acknowledgement of the IPP report would have opened a Pandora’s box. The public would have demanded similar auditing of all CPEC projects estimated at nearly $ 62 billion.Imran Khan’s U-turn and the deafening silence of the media tells a sordid tale of how the deep state uses fear as an instrument of coercion to manipulate the public discourse, or in this case, make it disappear altogether. Notwithstanding the fact that the report has already been leaked, it is incredible how an entire nation has shut its eyes to its existence.People can perhaps handle the truth about corruption in high places. Some might even argue that they are by now immune to it. What they may not be able to handle with as much ease though, is the truth about the spineless character of its establishment that would rather make common Pakistanis pay through the nose to shield ‘friends’ in Islamabad and Beijing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-s-crusade-against-corruption-hits-the-glass-ceiling-it-is-made-in-china/story-W4UBLLxK1yg6kRFspatmKM.html
23-06-2020||World||Pompeo compares ex-security advisor John Bolton to Edward Snowden||John Bolton’s explosive tell-all account of his time as National Security Advisor is comparable to Edward Snowden’s disclosure of state-backed mass surveillance of US citizens, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Monday. Pompeo’s comments come the night before the release of Bolton’s book “The Room Where It Happened,” which contains many damning allegations against President Donald Trump.“Frankly, the information he has released puts criminal liability squarely on him,” the top US diplomat told Fox News.“We all saw what’s happened when people leak classified information like Edward Snowden. What John Bolton did here is not dissimilar to that,” Pompeo said.Edward Snowden is a former US intelligence contractor who revealed in 2013 that US agents from the National Security Agency (NSA) were carrying out widespread surveillance on citizens.Snowden has been living in exile in Russia since his revelation. He has been charged in the US with espionage and theft of state secrets and faces up to 30 years in prison.“This kind of information getting out, it presents real risk and real harm to the United States of America,” Pompeo added.Bolton’s book is an account of his 17 months serving as National Security Advisor.The book contends that Trump is not “fit for office” and describes the president “pleading” with his Chinese counterpart President Xi Jinping to help boost his chances of re-election in November.Over the past few days, Trump and his team, including Pompeo, have vacillated between two courses of action: denouncing the book as “fiction,” but also claiming it is full of highly sensitive, classified information.The White House had sought to halt the book’s publication, but a US judge refused Saturday to block its release, saying it was too late for a restraining order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-compares-ex-security-advisor-john-bolton-to-edward-snowden/story-kS9COrcwWsGgq6XXjgbwCN.html
23-06-2020||World||Patagonia joins The North Face in Facebook ad boycott||Outdoor apparel brand Patagonia Inc will pause its ads on Facebook Inc and Facebook’s photo-sharing app, Instagram, making it the latest company to join a boycott campaign organized by US civil rights groups. “We will pull all ads on Facebook and Instagram, effective immediately, through at least the end of July, pending meaningful action from the social media giant,” the company said in a series of tweets on Sunday attributed to its head of marketing, Cory Bayers. The Stop Hate for Profit campaign was started last week by several US civil rights groups who said the social network was doing too little to stop hate speech on its platforms.Patagonia, which has been politically vocal in the past, joins companies including clothing maker VF Corp’s outdoor brand The North Face, Recreational Equipment Inc, or REI, and recruiting company Upwork in pausing Facebook ads. A VF Corp spokesman told Reuters other brands in its portfolio were actively discussing whether to take the same action.“From secure elections to a global pandemic to racial justice, the stakes are too high to sit back and let the company continue to be complicit in spreading disinformation and fomenting fear and hatred,” said one of Patagonia’s tweets.The campaign follows the death of George Floyd, a US Black man who died in police custody, which has triggered worldwide protests against racism and police brutality. Floyd died after a Minneapolis police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him on May 25. Facebook’s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, was criticized after the company, unlike Twitter Inc, decided not to take action on an inflammatory post by US President Donald Trump about the protests. “We deeply respect any brand’s decision, and remain focused on the important work of removing hate speech and providing critical voting information,” Carolyn Everson, vice president of Facebook’s global business group, said in a statement on Monday. “Our conversations with marketers and civil rights organizations are about how, together, we can be a force for good.”Facebook is the second-largest US digital ad player after Alphabet Inc’s Google, according to eMarketer. Patagonia and VF Corp did not immediately respond to Reuters questions about how much they spend on Facebook advertising.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/patagonia-joins-the-north-face-in-facebook-ad-boycott/story-KVbBwFy7i75tkqKALkURVO.html
23-06-2020||World||Former Pakistan president Zardari, others to be indicted in money laundering case on July 7||Former Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari and others accused in a money laundering case will be indicted by the accountability court here on July 7.Accountability Judge Mohammad Azam Khan on Tuesday announced that the accused who are already in jail can attend the hearing through video link, while others will have to appear in person during the framing of the charges against them.Zardai, who is the president of Pakistan Peoples Party, was arrested last year for probe in two cases of money laundering and Park Lane but was later set free on bail.The 64-year-old former president has rejected all the charges against him and termed them politically motivated.Those who are in prison include Khawaja Anwar Majeed, who is in judicial custody at the district jail in Karachi, and Hussain Lawai, Taha Raza and Mohammad Umair, who are in judicial custody in Adiala jail, Rawalpindi.An FIR in the case was lodged on July 6, 2018 by the Federal Investigation Agency, alleging that a huge amount of money was being laundered through fake and forged accounts.The companies and persons involved in the forged accounts were named in the FIR and it was alleged that the scam is worth about Rs 4.145 billion.Separately, the accountability court is scheduled to indict Zardari and others in the Park Lane case on June 26.The Park Lane land case is being investigated against Zardari for his alleged involvement in extending loan and its misappropriation by M/s Parthenon Private Limited, M/s Park Lane Estate Private Limited and others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-pakistan-president-zardari-others-to-be-indicted-in-money-laundering-case-on-july-7/story-WGHFkIXIAGMpB8R4NIROdI.html
23-06-2020||World||Germany imposes local lockdown after virus outbreak at meat plant||The premier of the western German state of North Rhine-Westphalia said on Tuesday he was putting the Guetersloh area back into lockdown until June 30 after a coronavirus outbreak at a meatpacking plant there.Guetersloh, with about 360,000 residents, is the first area in Germany to go back into lockdown after the authorities began gradually lifting restrictive measures at the end of April.State premier Armin Laschet, who had led calls for Germany to ease lockdown measures, said bars, museums, galleries, cinemas, sports halls, gyms and swimming pools in Guetersloh would be closed, and picnics and barbecues prohibited.“We will lift the measure as soon as possible, when we have certainty about the safety of the infection,” Laschet told a news conference. “It is a preventative measure.”More than 1,500 workers at a meat processing plant in Guetersloh had tested positive for the coronavirus, plus some of their family members and 24 people with no connection to the plant, he said.Laschet is a leading contender to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel when her fourth term in office expires next year. Further outbreaks of the virus in his state, Germany’s most populous, could damage his chances.State premiers had agreed to act locally where possible to suppress the virus and there was no justification now for broader action, Laschet said. Earlier on Tuesday, the head of the Robert Koch Institute for public health, Lothar Wieler, said local outbreaks had been a major factor behind a spike in the last few days in the coronavirus reproduction rate, currently estimated at 2.76.A reproduction rate, or ‘R’, of 2.76 means that 100 people who have contracted the virus infect, on average, 276 others.While Germany was at risk of a second coronavirus wave, Wieler said he was optimistic it could be prevented.

23-06-2020||World||Trump risks scaring off GOP voters as he bashes mail-in ballots||President Donald Trump has repeatedly said vote-by-mail could cost him re-election. Some Republican strategists think he’s right, but more because the president’s words risk scaring away his own voters than because of fraud.Trump argues, without citing evidence, that mail-in balloting is open to manipulation, vulnerable to foreign forgeries and beneficial to rival Joe Biden. On Monday, Trump tweeted, without evidence, that “millions of mail-in ballots will be printed by foreign countries” and that the election will be “rigged” against him if voting by mail persists.Experts say it would be extremely difficult to forge mail-in ballots given security measures in place in local and state elections offices.But although research has shown that vote-by-mail gives no inherent advantage to either party, some Republican strategists say Trump’s repeated attacks are turning off GOP voters at a time when coronavirus adds risk to in-person voting, giving Democrats an opening to organize this fall.Trump’s rhetoric comes as polls show him losing to Biden. As he resumed campaigning after a virus-prompted hold with Saturday’s Tulsa rally, Trump got his first indication that his campaign may be in trouble when 6,200 people showed up in an arena that holds 19,000.Biden campaign manager Jen O’Malley Dillon dismissed Trump’s accusations Monday night, saying the president and his allies were pursuing a “program of voter suppression.”“Voters should have more options for voting, not fewer, and no American should have to choose between their health and exercising their right to vote,” she said. “That means expanding options for participation, including no-excuse absentee ballots, increased in-person early voting, and safe in-person voting on Election Day.”As many states have expanded vote-by-mail, polls show a partisan gap for the first time, with Republicans much less confident in absentee ballots than Democrats. In one extreme example, some of the president’s supporters gathered to burn vote-by-mail applications at a protest near Grand Rapids, Michigan.On Sunday, Attorney General William Barr repeated a claim that absentee ballots are open to fraud in an interview with Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures.”“When government, state governments, start adopting these practices like mail-in ballots that open the floodgates of potential fraud, then people’s confidence in the outcome of the election is going to be undermined,” he said. “And that could take the country to a very dark place, if we lose confidence in the outcomes of our elections.”A Quinnipiac University poll this month found that Republicans opposed mail-in ballots 73% to 23% and Democrats supported them 90% to 8%. Overall, 59% of Americans favored allowing all voters to vote by mail in November due to the coronavirus pandemic, 38% were opposed. Other polls show Republicans are now much less confident than Democrats that their own mail-in ballots will be counted.Increasing PartisanshipRecent primaries show the divide between Democrats and Republicans over mail-in ballots may extend to how they actually vote.In the key swing state of Pennsylvania, which began allowing no-excuse absentee voting this year, 1.3 million Democrats requested a mail-in ballot for the June 2 primary, nearly two-and-a-half times the number of Republican voters who did so.Democrats also outpaced Republicans in absentee voting in Iowa’s primary that same day, and pulled even with Republicans in Georgia’s primary on June 9 after years of running behind.Rob Stutzman, a Republican consultant in California, said the administration’s arguments are scaring everyday Republican voters away from using absentee ballots.“He is disadvantaging Republican candidates and campaigns,” he said. “I don’t know any strategist that thinks it’s a good idea to be pooh-poohing vote-by-mail.”Researchers who have studied vote-by-mail have found no evidence to support Trump’s assertion that it is rife with fraud or that more people using it would mean “you’d never have a Republican elected in this country again.”An April study by Stanford University found that in states that shifted to entirely vote-by-mail from 1996 to 2018, neither party gained in its share of either votes or turnout, even as overall turnout increased.If anything, Democrats may face a disadvantage, as other research has shown that young, black and Hispanic voters – three Democratic-leaning groups -- are more likely to have their mail-in ballots rejected by elections officials.But the research doesn’t mean vote-by-mail can’t be decisive in a specific election.Former Pennsylvania Governor Tom Ridge, a Republican who co-chairs VoteSafe, a bipartisan group advocating vote-by-mail, said that either party could gain an advantage on mail-in voting if they worked at it hard enough, especially if their opponent didn’t.“It’s like blocking and tackling in football,” he said. “There’s certain things you can do to improve your performance. You want to get people to the polls, and if they can’t get there for a variety of reasons, you want to have safe and secure options. The party that realizes that does have an advantage.”Ridge said Trump’s attacks are “counterintuitive” and out of step with campaign managers and grassroots organizers from his own party, and he worries that Trump may be affecting the views of Republican voters as well. Trump’s attacks have fueled a broader Republican effort to prevent voting by mail, including millions of dollars earmarked for lawsuits and advertising.Greater AccessBut it may already be too late to stop absentee voting on a wide scale in November. Thirty-four states and the District of Columbia allow any voter to cast an absentee ballot. Many other states have eased restrictions in response to the pandemic, leaving just four that currently require an excuse to vote absentee: Missouri, Mississippi, Tennessee and Texas. All have Republican governors.Because of the pandemic, elections officials from both parties in several states have decided to automatically send every voter an application for an absentee ballot to make the process smoother. But when Michigan’s Democratic secretary of state announced she would do so, Trump harshly criticized her and threatened to pull federal funding from the state.In Iowa, a similar effort by the Republican secretary of state in the recent primary led to more than 10 times the number of mail-in ballots as the state had in its 2016 primary, helping break a turnout record set in 1994.But eight days later, the Republican-led state Senate passed a wide-ranging bill that would limit the secretary of state’s ability to send similar letters in future elections.Vote-by-mail advocates say that efforts to restrict it will only add to the strain on in-person voting during a pandemic, as seen in the Wisconsin, Washington, D.C., and Georgia primaries, which saw long lines at polling places, problems with voting equipment and election worker shortages.While Democrats worry that Election Day problems will hurt voters in big cities, Stutzman said Republican campaigns should also consider that a resurgence in the coronavirus could keep older Republican voters away from the polls on Election Day because they are more at risk from the virus.“If you haven’t already been banking these mail ballots, you run a huge risk of losing some of your vote,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-risks-scaring-off-gop-voters-as-he-bashes-mail-in-ballots/story-MGPjEwwcy9mxoheg8wVPiM.html
23-06-2020||World||PIA plane crashed due to human error, says preliminary probe report||The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane crash last month was caused by the negligence of the cockpit crew and the air control tower and not due to any technical fault, according to a preliminary investigation report on the tragedy that killed 97 people onboard.The domestic flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed in a residential area near the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on May 22.The Airbus A320 aircraft of the national carrier had 91 passengers and a crew of eight when it crashed into the Jinnah Garden area near Model Colony in Malir on Friday, minutes before its landing. One girl died on the ground after suffering burn injuries.Two passengers miraculously survived the crash.A probe was commissioned by the government with the commitment that the initial report would be shared with Parliament on June 22.But Aviation Minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan handed the report to Prime Minister Imran Khan instead of Parliament.The report showed that pilot and air traffic control officials were primarily responsible, according to officials.The Express Tribune reported that the initial probe showed that the CAA officials, the cockpit crew, the control tower and the air traffic control repeatedly made mistakes. It reported the aircraft’s black box has so far not indicated the possibility of any technical fault.The report said both the speed and the altitude of the aircraft was more than the recommended parameters when the pilot tried first landing.In the first landing, the aircraft touched the ground at the middle of a 9,000-meter long runway.The control tower permitted landing despite the greater speed and altitude. The air traffic control also did not provide the control tower with the radio frequency.The pilot also did not inform the control tower about jamming of the landing gears. It was also the wrong decision on part of the pilot to attempt a second landing.The plane stayed in the air for 17 minutes after the first landing attempt, a crucial time during which both the engines of the aircraft failed.It said fragments of the PIA aircraft’s engine stayed on the runway for 12 hours but the air site unit did not collect them and later other aircraft were allowed to land on the runway.This was a violation of the standard operating procedure as it could cause damage to other aircraft.According to the report, the air traffic control officials should have been relieved after the incident but they continued to perform their duties till 7pm.It said the aircraft’s first engine was installed on February 25, 2019 while its second engine was installed on May 27, 2019.All three landing gears of the aircraft were installed on October 18, 2014. The fateful plane was 16-year-old and was manufactured in 2004. The plane was included in the PIA fleet in October 2014, according to the Express Tribune. The aviation minister told the National Assembly on Monday that the report will be shared with parliament on Wednesday as he confirmed sharing it with the Prime Minister.Official sources said that the report was shared with the aviation ministry on Monday and investigation team head Air Commodore Usman Ghani gave a detailed briefing while submitting the report.The minister said other reports on different air incidents since 2010, including Air Blue and Bhoja airlines’ plane crashes in Islamabad and PIA plane crash near Haripur etc would also be shared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pia-plane-crashed-due-to-human-error-says-preliminary-probe-report/story-a6YVQxZ3uygaHB9b3gM12O.html
23-06-2020||World||UK to lay out more reopening plans as coronavirus toll eases||Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to outline plans Tuesday to allow Britons to go to a movie, enjoy pints in a pub and get a haircut — the latest easing of lockdown measures imposed three months ago to slow the spread of the new coronavirus.Johnson will speak to Parliament on Tuesday afternoon after meeting his Cabinet in the morning.The lockdown loosening, expected to take effect on July 4, comes amid intense pressure from businesses to relax a government requirement that people who are indoors must stay 2 meters (6 1/2 feet) apart.Britain’s pubs and restaurants, many of which operate in small spaces, are urging a reduction to 1 meter (3 feet) — the minimum recommended by the World Health Organization — saying without it many will go under.The social distancing requirement is also a concern for educators hoping to safely open British schools in the fall.The Conservative government is desperate to restart the stalled British economy, and that desire is likely to be reflected in guidance to re-open businesses ranging from hotels to hairdressers.But some scientists are worried that the government is reopening the economy too fast and that a track-and-trace system meant to quickly stamp out any outbreaks is not fully functional.Britain has Europe’s highest death toll from the virus, with almost 42,700 confirmed dead. That is also the third-highest death toll in the world after the United States and Brazil, which both have much larger populations.The number of daily deaths and new infections in the U.K. has fallen significantly from its April peak, but the country is still confirming 1,000 or more new Covid-19 cases a day.WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris urged the British government to use caution.“The U.K. has brought a very difficult outbreak right down,” she told the BBC. “Very good news in the last couple of days about the limitation in cases, and far, far fewer people dying. So now is the moment to celebrate that by being super careful.”The measures being announced by Johnson apply only in England. Other parts of the U.K. —Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — are all following slightly different lockdown plans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-lay-out-more-reopening-plans-as-coronavirus-toll-eases/story-iWa6Vht2TquiT3fpQVN51K.html

Pigs are a useful research model for this type of vaccine and other trials have been able to predict vaccine outcomes in humans, particularly in studies of flu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pig-trial-of-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-shows-promise-with-two-shots/story-sr2ETubG6PNNO5DjXDKhcM.html
23-06-2020||World||Beijing says mass testing for Covid-19 to enter ‘fast track’||Beijing’s mass testing for the new coronavirus will soon enter a “fast track” as the city’s testing capacity expands, a senior municipal health official said on Tuesday, following a sudden return of COVID-19 nearly two weeks ago. The city of more than 20 million residents reported its first case in the latest outbreak on June 11. The infections were linked to the sprawling Xinfadi wholesale food centre in the southwest of Beijing, which had until then reported no new cases for nearly two months. In the 12 days since, 249 people have been infected in the worst outbreak in Beijing since the novel coronavirus was identified at a seafood market in the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year. Beijing can now administer more than 300,000 nucleic acid tests per day compared with 40,000 in March, Zhang Hua, deputy director at the Beijing Municipal Health Commission, told reporters. Beijing took samples from 2.95 million people between June 12 and June 22, Zhang said.“The strategy of Beijing’s nucleic acid screening is mainly based on the level of risk and on severity,” Zhang said, when asked if everyone in Beijing would be tested. Testing will be done in batches and according to the profile of individuals, he said. “We’ll give priority to testing high-risk groups in Xinfadi and other markets involved in the outbreak as well as surrounding communities,” Zhang said. “On this basis, we’ve tested workers in restaurants, supermarkets, marketplaces, as well as residents in high-risk neighbourhoods. Food delivery workers and parcel couriers have also undergone large-scale testing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-says-mass-testing-for-covid-19-to-enter-fast-track/story-sPQYX6iVjvgeVsfn8zjcpL.html
23-06-2020||World||Anthony Fauci to testify at a fraught time for US Covid-19 pandemic response||With coronavirus cases rising in about half the states and political polarization competing for attention with public health recommendations, Dr. Anthony Fauci returns to Capitol Hill on Tuesday at a fraught moment in the nation’s pandemic response.The government’s top infectious disease expert will testify before a House committee, along with the heads of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, and a top official at the Department of Health and Human Services.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Since Fauci’s last appearance at a high-profile hearing more than a month ago, the US is emerging from weeks of stay-at-home orders and business shutdowns. But it’s being done in an uneven way, with some states far less cautious than others. A trio of states with Republican governors who are bullish on reopening — Arizona, Florida and Texas — are among those seeing worrisome increases in cases.Last week, Vice President Mike Pence published an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal saying the administration’s efforts have strengthened the nation’s ability to counter the virus and should be “a cause for celebration.” Then President Donald Trump said at his weekend rally in Tulsa that he had asked administration officials to slow down testing, because too many positive cases are turning up.Many rally goers did not wear masks, and for some that was an act of defiance against what they see as government intrusion. White House officials later tried to walk back Trump’s comment on testing, suggesting it wasn’t meant to be taken literally.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Fauci has recently warned that the US is still in the first wave of the pandemic and has continued to urge the American public to practice social distancing. And, in a recent ABC News interview, he said political demonstrations such as protests against racial injustice are “risky” to all involved. Asked if that applied to Trump rallies, he said it did. Fauci continues to recognize widespread testing as critical for catching clusters of Covid-19 cases before they turn into full outbreaks in a given community.About 2.3 million Americans have been sickened in the pandemic, and some 120,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.As head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Fauci will be joined before the House Energy and Commerce Committee by CDC director Dr. Robert Redfield, FDA chief Dr. Stephen Hahn, and Adm. Brett Giroir, head of the U.S. Public Health Service.Giroir was tapped by the White House to oversee the expansion of coronavirus testing. But he gained notoriety after a whistleblower complaint flagged him for trying to push a malaria drug touted by Trump to treat Covid-19 without conclusive scientific evidence. The FDA has since withdrawn its emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine.“There have been a lot of unfortunate missteps in the Trump administration’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic,” said committee Chairman Frank Pallone, D-N.J. “As communities across the country ease social distancing guidance and reopen their economies, it is critically important that both the administration and Congress remain focused on containing the spread of the coronavirus and providing the resources and support Americans need during this time of crisis.” There is still no vaccine for Covid-19, and there are no treatments specifically developed for the disease, although the antiviral drug remdesivir has been shown to help some patients, as well as a steroid called dexamethasone, and plasma from patients who have recovered.Fauci remains optimistic that a vaccine will be found, noting that patients develop antibodies to the virus — a sign that the human immune system is able to battle back. However, he shies away from promising results by the end of the year, as Trump has done.The Energy and Commerce panel has oversight over drugs and vaccines, among other facets of the U.S. health care system. Committee Democrats have been harshly critical of the administration. However, not all Republicans have lined up to defend the White House. Some GOP members started growing concerned early in the year that the administration wasn’t doing enough to prepare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-to-testify-at-a-fraught-time-for-us-covid-19-pandemic-response/story-q6qYwblJuHrultBGCaFOQJ.html
23-06-2020||World||UK PM to set July 4 date to end Covid-19 lockdown with bars reopening||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is on Tuesday set to announce July 4 as the date for a significant lifting of lockdown restrictions in the country, with cinemas, museums, bars, pubs and restaurants being allowed to open their doors to the public once again.The venues, which have been closed for at least three months since the UK went into its official coronavirus-induced lockdown on March 23, will be required to have safety measures set out under government guidance in place to be able to operate. The Cabinet will meet on Tuesday to officially rubber-stamp the decision to allow public venues, including theatres and businesses such as hairdressers, to reopen from July 4, effectively marking an end to the lockdown in what some British MPs have dubbed “Super Saturday”.Johnson is then due to set out some details in the House of Commons on how pubs and other social venues can safely reopen, following a review of the 2-metre mandatory social distancing rule by the UK’s Covid-19 strategy group on Monday. The UK prime minister is expected to tell Parliament that the 2-metre social distancing rule will also be halved to 1 metre (3ft 3in) from July 4, with some mitigating measures. The government had come under pressure from the hospitality sector, and some MPs from within the ruling Conservative Party, to relax the 2m rule, with many saying it would be impossible to trade under the current measures.The Opposition Labour Party has said its support would depend on employees having adequate protective equipment, such as face shields, and there being an effective testing and tracing system in place. The devolved administrations of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will set out their own lockdown easing plans, though the government is pushing for a UK-wide approach.On Monday, the UK saw its lowest daily death toll from the deadly virus at 15 deaths to hit a total figure of 42, 647, prompting UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock to declare that the virus was “in retreat” in the country. The minister also said that from July 6, the people in the vulnerable health category who have been shielding behind closed doors will be able to spend time outdoors in a group of up to six people, including those outside of their household, while maintaining social distancing. “Now, with infection rates continuing to fall in our communities, our medical experts have advised that we can now ease some of these measures, while keeping people safe,” said Hancock.From August 1, the guidance will then be relaxed so clinically extremely vulnerable people will no longer be advised to shield, but support will remain available from National Health Service (NHS) volunteers and local councils.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-to-set-july-4-date-to-end-covid-19-lockdown-with-bars-reopening/story-GmbTnUCWCp7RqAFV3rZkhI.html

The State Department denounced four organisations -- China Central Television, the China News Service, the People’s Daily and the Global Times -- as foreign missions and “propaganda outlets”, adding to five others designated in February.Beijing hit back in March by expelling US citizens working for three major American newspapers -- The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-threatens-appropriate-response-to-us-over-media-curbs/story-cTIl5w5YakZGkNMLeK8bBN.html

Colombian label Beso de Negra translates as kiss from a black woman.In Australia, Nestle said Red Skins raspberry-flavored candy and chocolate jelly Chicos will be “quickly” renamed. Redskin is a pejorative term for Native Americans.“This decision acknowledges the need to ensure that nothing we do marginalizes our friends, neighbors and colleagues,” Nestle said in a statement in Sydney on Tuesday. “These names have overtones which are out of step with Nestlé’s values, which are rooted in respect.”An increasing number of consumer-goods companies are re-branding old trademarks following weeks of anti-racism protests in the U.S. that spilled over to the rest of the world. PepsiCo Inc. is changing the name of its Aunt Jemima pancake mix and syrup, while Mars Inc. is evaluating the Uncle Ben’s rice brand.Dreyer’s, which Nestle recently transferred to its Froneri ice cream joint venture with PAI Partners, is also taking action on its Eskimo Pie business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nestle-pulls-beso-de-negra-red-skins-candy-in-racial-review/story-uxeW5g0hjGg48nKbyGnzeP.html
23-06-2020||World||China dog meat festival goes ahead but virus takes a toll||Volunteers at a Beijing dog shelter hand out treats to dozens of rescued animals which had been bound for a controversial dog meat festival under way this week in southern China. The annual event in Yulin city always provokes outrage from animal rights activists, but this year they hope the coronavirus epidemic will be the death knell of a tradition they see as cruel.It is “inhumane and barbaric”, said Jeffrey Bari, founder of the No Dogs Left Behind organisation, which keeps around 200 canines in large wire enclosures on the outskirts of the Chinese capital and re-homes them.Activists save hundreds of dogs every year by raiding slaughterhouses and intercepting trucks. They say traders steal pets and strays and transport them long distances, mostly to the country’s south. “You feel a kind of achievement because you’ve changed some dog’s life,” said Ling, who volunteers at the centre.Dog meat is traditionally believed to be good for the health in certain parts of China, but the habit has been in steady decline as more and more affluent urban dwellers choose to keep the animals as pets.The Covid-19 outbreak appears to have further reduced the appetite for dog meat after the disease was linked to a market in the central city of Wuhan selling animals for food.Amid growing concerns about hygiene, China fast-tracked laws banning the consumption and trade of wildlife.While the law does not apply to dog meat, Shenzhen and Zhuhai -- southern cities not far from Yulin -- banned the consumption of dogs in April, becoming the first cities in China to do so.And last month the agriculture ministry reclassified dogs as companion animals, not livestock, though it did not explicitly prohibit eating them.Falling attendanceVideo footage of this year’s Yulin dog meat festival verified by AFP shows dozens of animals crammed in small, dirty cages and butchers at several large stalls piled high with dog carcasses.But restaurant workers involved in the week-long event, which they say started Sunday and has been renamed the “Yulin Summer Solstice Festival”, told AFP that attendance was down.“The number of arriving customers has dropped a lot,” said a man surnamed Chen.He said the dog meat restaurant where he works would open as normal this festival without any special events or pricing like in past years.Some posts on the Chinese social network Weibo called for the festival to be cancelled entirely after COVID-19 and a recent fresh outbreak of the disease in Beijing linked to a wholesale food market.“Is it not enough that (the festival) is infamous throughout the world? Where will food safety become a reality... Stop this damn festival at once,” one user wrote.Experts pointed to a shift in public attitudes towards dog meat consumption and food safety in the wake of the virus. A proposal for China’s first nationwide law banning animal cruelty received wide public support during the annual parliamentary session in May, while a viral video of a Chinese university student torturing a cat sparked mass public outcry in April.Chen said neither police nor the government had ordered his restaurant to stop selling dog meat as a result of the animal’s reclassification as pets. “I would say that (the rule) impacted the rest of the country and people were talking about it, but I did not see it having an immediate impact on the dog meat trade in Yulin,” said Peter Li of the animal rights group Humane Society International.Despite the efforts of activists and concerns about hygiene, the Yulin event has persisted with the local government’s tacit permission. “Most of the activities related to the sale of dog meat there are in violation of existing Chinese food safety regulations,” said Deborah Cao, professor of animal law and ethics at Griffith University in Australia.But she said “existing food safety laws in China are not enforced in most instances” and there is “no accountability.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-dog-meat-festival-goes-ahead-but-virus-takes-a-toll/story-EmDeHjo3JITjxdYFJbMENL.html
23-06-2020||World||Global investors demand to meet Brazil diplomats over deforestation||A group of 29 global investment firms that manage $3.7 trillion are demanding meetings with Brazilian diplomats around the world to call on right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro’s government to stop soaring deforestation in the Amazon rainforest.The investors, led by Norwegian insurance and pension firm Storebrand Asset Management, sent letters to Brazilian embassies in seven countries, calling for meetings and expressing concern that Brazil is rolling back environmental protections, according to a statement that included a copy of the letter.“The escalating deforestation in recent years, combined with reports of a dismantling of environmental and human rights policies and enforcement agencies, are creating widespread uncertainty about the conditions for investing in or providing financial services to Brazil,” the letter said.Environmental advocates blame Bolsonaro for weakening protections and causing a surge in deforestation and forest fires since he took office in 2019.Bolsonaro has argued Brazil is a model of conservation, while calling for more mining and farming in the Amazon region.Brazil’s Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment.Storebrand Asset Management CEO Jan Erik Saugestad said in an interview that while previous initiatives focused on pressuring Brazilian companies, this new effort is aimed squarely at the government.The 25 European firms that signed on include Norway’s Nordea Asset Management and the Church of England, which has a 2.8 billion pound ($3.5 billion) pension fund. The UK’s Legal & General Investment Management (LGIM) is among the largest investors with 1.2 trillion pounds under management.U.S.-based firms Domini Impact Investment and Pax World Funds have also signed the letter, while Sao Paulo-based Fram Capital is the only Brazilian signatory.While Europe has traditionally been the most vocal critic of Amazon deforestation, Japan’s Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Asset Management signed the letter, and Senior Sustainability Officer Seiji Kawazoe said he expects more Japanese firms to take issue with deforestation in the future.The letter does not spell out consequences if Brazil’s government does not take action, but seven European financial firms told Reuters last week they could divest from Brazil-linked holdings if environmental destruction continues. Many of those firms also signed the letter to embassies.($1 = 0.8094 pounds) (Reporting by Jake Spring; editing by Richard Pullin)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-investors-demand-to-meet-brazil-diplomats-over-deforestation/story-Mw4PrxbBLOtlLKpeV5vFXN.html
23-06-2020||World||Sanofi eyes approval of Covid-19 vaccine by first half of 2021||French drugmaker Sanofi SA said on Tuesday it expects to get approval for the potential Covid-19 vaccine it is developing with Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline Plc by the first half of next year, faster than previously anticipated.Sanofi, which is hosting a virtual research and development event, and GSK had said in April the vaccine, if successful, would be available in the second half of 2021.“We are being guided by our dialogue with regulatory authorities,” Sanofi research chief John Reed told reporters, when asked about the accelerated time frame.There are currently no vaccines to prevent the coronavirus that has infected more than 9 million people and killed over 469,000 globally, and only a couple of medicines that have demonstrated benefit in hospitalized Covid-19 patients in clinical trials.Many drugmakers are racing to come up with a safe and effective vaccine that can be produced at large scale.Moderna Inc, the University of Oxford in collaboration with AstraZeneca Plc, and an alliance of BioNTech and Pfizer Inc grabbed headlines by moving to human trials as early as March.Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson said the firsts in the race now were not assured of securing victory.“There are companies moving faster, but let us be brutally clear, speed has three downsides,” he said of competition.“They are using existing work, in many cases done for SARS; it is likely not to be as efficacious; and there is no guarantee on supply in large volumes,” Hudson said.The probability of success for Sanofi is “higher than anybody else,” the CEO said.The comments echoed those of GSK, whose chief medical officer for vaccines told Reuters on Friday the company was aiming at quality before speed.Sanofi, whose Pasteur vaccines division has a long established reputation, notably in flu, is currently working on two vaccine projects. One uses an adjuvant made by GSK to potentially boost its efficacy. It has received financial support from the US Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA).The other, being developed with U.S. company Translate Bio Inc, relies on a different technology known as mRNA, similar to the Moderna approach.Clinical trials of the vaccine developed with GSK, described as a recombinant vaccine because of the use of GSK’s boosting adjuvant, are to start in September. Trials of the mRNA vaccine candidate should begin around the end of the year, the company said.Sanofi said it had capacity to produce up to 1 billion doses a year of its recombinant vaccine, and that it would be able to supply up to 360 million doses of its mRNA vaccine annually. In April, Sanofi said it had manufacturing capacity for 600 million doses for its recombinant vaccine, with the ambition to double production by mid-2021.The company also said it would expand its collaboration with Translate Bio on developing vaccines, in a deal which will give the U.S. group $425 million in upfront payments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sanofi-eyes-approval-of-covid-19-vaccine-by-first-half-of-2021/story-G7tkil8NupGC8HKxhyY67N.html
23-06-2020||World||Coronavirus surge threatens poor nations exiting lockdown||Developing countries face an explosion in coronavirus infections as they exit lockdowns amid worsening outbreaks because the economic cost of remaining shuttered is too great.From Pakistan to the Philippines, Brazil to South Africa, governments have been choosing to end orders confining people to their homes even as the global pandemic envelopes the developing world. Researchers at the University of Michigan predict India’s infections could almost double from current levels to more than 750,000 by mid-July, while Brazil just hit 1 million cases -- the second-highest tally globally - with more increases forecast for this month.Soaring unemployment and even starvation are forcing many countries to end sometimes months-long lockdowns that largely failed to stymie the virus like they did in Europe and China. With a coronavirus vaccine still months -- maybe even years -- away, these escalating outbreaks risk fueling the wider pandemic just as richer countries start to open up their economies and nations including China and the US see resurgences.Policy makers in poorer countries are now left with few potent tools to combat a virus that has the potential to overwhelm their health-care systems. In many places, those systems remain fragile despite efforts to add hospital beds and testing facilities when citizens were compelled to stay at home.“There’s a de-facto realization that we’re going to have to live with this virus at infection levels that up to this point had been seen as dangerous and unacceptable, and couple it with a different strategy,” said Stephen Morrison, director of the Global Health Policy Center at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “The lockdown and social distancing practices don’t work or have limited utility in so many developing countries.”With more than 2.3 million cases, the US remains the nation with the world’s largest number of infections. But data compiled by Bloomberg show that the US and U.K. now account for about 29% of global cases, down from 37% two months ago.Meanwhile, Latin American and South Asia are emerging as hotspots. The 10 countries from those regions with the most number of infections accounted for 29% of infections globally as of Sunday. Two months ago, they comprised only 5% of the world’s cases.Working to EatIn the US, some states have also come out of lockdown while the virus has been spreading, but the challenges of managing widespread shutdowns are particularly severe in poorer nations.In the Philippines, the experience of house cleaner Yolanda, who didn’t want to be publicly identified by her full name, shows why lockdowns weren’t as effective in halting the virus in developing countries. When the stay-at-home order came down in March, her husband, three children and five grandchildren all depended on her to put food on the table.Staying home would have put the entire family at risk of starvation. Yolanda said she applied for aid to a local government center, but even though her neighbors received packages of canned sardines, noodles and rice, she got none and was given no explanation.“I can’t afford not to work,” said the 52-year-old, who is among the millions that make up the informal workforce in metropolitan Manila. “I couldn’t have stayed at home. Bills were mounting. We can’t rely on the government for aid.”Surging InfectionsThe government of President Rodrigo Duterte has allowed businesses and transportation to resume and eased other restrictions since June 1.Since then, infections have surged. The University of the Philippines forecasts cases will rise 50% to top 40,000 by the end of June. While that is substantially lower than the hundreds of thousands in the US, Brazil and India, the increases are substantial for the Philippines which has a population of 108 million and has tested about 0.5% of its residents, based on estimates from its health department.Shutting down businesses, telling people to stay at home and enforcing lockdowns helped prevent half a billion infections in China, South Korea, Italy, Iran, France, and the US, according to a recent study published in the journal Nature. But such steps aren’t as effective in poorer countries because housing is typically much denser, a challenge to social distancing. Also, much more of their workforce are employed in informal labor, reliant on daily wages.India imposed its lockdown almost three months ago, and some restrictions like bans on international flights remain in place. While the country has ramped up manufacturing of face masks, ventilators and testing kits, and sports stadiums and railway cars have been set up as isolation centers, it still may not be enough.“The public and government almost had an expectation that the lockdown was going to eradicate the disease,” said Bhramar Mukherjee, an epidemiologist and biostatistics chair at Michigan University’s School of Public Health that’s part of the team modeling India’s epidemic. “It is becoming evident that the virus is not going away. This pandemic is like a wave and when one cascade of waves subside, others emerge.”Mega-cities like New Delhi and Mumbai are already showing signs of being overwhelmed, with bodies piling up in hospital corridors and patients turned away for lack of beds. India currently has about 425,000 cases and 13,699 deaths, for a fatality rate of 3%. That compares to 5% in the US, which Indian officials say shows their approach is paying off.India’s health ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment. But officials in India and Indonesia, which has the highest case tally in Southeast Asia, have said that people may have to learn to live with the virus. Countries like India and the Philippines are now relying on other tactics such as using lockdowns only in specific communities where the virus is spreading vociferously.A study on São Paulo, home to about 45 million Brazilians, conducted by the Solidary Research Network, a group of researchers from institutions including Universidade de São Paulo, found that if the state had kept the same social distancing rules that were in place in May for another 30 days, deaths would have risen at a slower pace to about 14,600 by July 8.But these restrictions -- which included closing businesses, schools and many public places -- were eased in June. The research group now estimates deaths could reach nearly 25,000 by July 8.While Brazil did not have a nationwide lockdown, various states imposed restrictions on people’s movements and some have now begun to ease quarantine orders. But there are a confluence of factors working against countries like Brazil, beyond a president who has been criticized for dismissing the seriousness of the pandemic. In the slums of São Paulo and elsewhere, extended families share one-room shanties and social distancing is a nearly impossible task. Lack of reliable clean water and sanitation systems also allowed the virus to take root.Estimates from PUC University in Rio de Janeiro show Brazil’s infections will likely surpass 1.4 million by late June, with more than 60,000 deaths.“We have epidemics at different stages now depending on the location,” said epidemiologist Gulnar Azevedo e Silva of the Institute of Social Medicine at Rio de Janeiro State University. “We need to solve the problem of the first wave still.”Economic HitEmerging economies have already been among the hardest-hit from lockdowns, and worsening outbreaks could see further pressure on consumer spending and growth. The Philippines’ gross domestic product will likely contract as much as 3.4% this year, while India is facing its first economic contraction in 40 years.The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development sees Brazil’s GDP contracting 7.4% this year, though it could shrink by as much as 9.1% if there’s a resurgence of the virus as the country reopens, the OECD says.In sub-Saharan Africa, the region is reeling from its first recession in 25 years, according to the World Bank.Nigeria, Ghana and Senegal have all seen virus cases spike over the past month. South Africa has more than 101,000 confirmed coronavirus infections and 1,990 fatalities.South Africa’s government has also eased restrictions to salvage its economy. A court in the country also ruled that some lockdown regulations were unconstitutional. The case was filed by a human-rights group that said millions of already impoverished people were being deprived of an income by the curbs.“Governments are faced with choosing between potential surges in infections and the potential starvation and deprivation of their population,” said Kobi Annan, an analyst at risk consultancy Songhai Advisory, based in Ghana and the UK. “Longer-term lockdowns in developing countries are just not an option -- we don’t have social safety nets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-surge-threatens-poor-nations-exiting-lockdown/story-OREDancwGyWc0GvawGIpFP.html
23-06-2020||World||‘Very negative consequences’: EU presses China over trade, warns on Hong Kong law||The European Union told China on Monday to make good on a promise to open up its economy and warned of “very negative consequences” if Beijing goes ahead with a new security law on Hong Kong that the West says will curtail basic rights.Speaking after video calls with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and President Xi Jinping, the EU’s chief executive and chairman said they had repeated accusations that Beijing has spread disinformation about the coronavirus.“The relationship between the EU and China is simultaneously one of the most strategically important and one of the most challenging that we have,” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a news conference.European Council President Charles Michel said China was not reciprocating the welcome that Chinese companies receive in Europe.Calling China a partner and a rival, von der Leyen said Beijing had not followed up on a 2019 deal to allow greater access for European companies in China or drop rules requiring investors to share their know-how in Chinese joint ventures.When asked about von der Leyen’s comments on the 2019 deal on Tuesday, Wang Lutong, the head of the Chinese foreign ministry’s Europe office, said that tangible progress has been made on areas like green financing and government procurement, and that patience was needed.Even before the coronavirus pandemic worsened Sino-European ties, the EU found itself caught between China and the United States, needing both and reluctant to alienate either.Li expressed optimism about the relationship, according to Chinese state media, saying China and the EU are more partners than competitors. But the EU wants to see progress on an investment agreement under negotiation since 2014. EU officials say they want to see movement in areas such as autos, biotech and micro-electronics and see Beijing limit subsidies for state-run companies.Germany has postponed an EU leaders’ summit with Xi in September, citing the coronavirus, though diplomats said it was in part because of the impasse in investment negotiations.HONG KONGMichel and von der Leyen said they told Li and Xi of their concerns over China’s security law for Hong Kong, which democracy activists, diplomats and some businesses say will jeopardise its semi-autonomous status and role as a global financial hub.China’s parliament reacted angrily on Saturday to a resolution by the EU assembly protesting against the security law.“We also conveyed that China risks very negative consequences if it goes forward with imposing this law,” von der Leyen said, without giving details. “The European Union is in touch with our G7 partners on this topic and we’ve made our position very clear to the Chinese leadership today and urged them to reconsider.”Wang of China’s foreign ministry told a news conference in Beijing that “security legislation in Hong Kong is a domestic affair of China” and that it opposed “any foreign interference.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/very-negative-consequences-eu-presses-china-over-trade-warns-on-hong-kong-law/story-44FNL8P72pKJPj6tWXIeeN.html
23-06-2020||World||Europe wants your medical data in its fight for an edge in AI||When thousands in Europe caught Covid-19 in March, France began collecting information on everything from early symptoms and drug sales to lab tests.In a country noted for its strict approach to data protection, these efforts have gained the attention of regulators. On Friday, France’s top court cited these concerns when it asked Microsoft Corp., which is hosting the hub project, to hand over details on what data is migrating to the US and whether it can assure confidentiality.“The virus forced us to accelerate things,” Stephanie Combes, the hub’s director, said in an interview. “This crisis shows us why we were created: to have actionable data. But we have to go much further. We need to rethink how we collect health data.”France’s data project project began in March 2019 after a Fields medal-winning mathematician warned that the country needed to up its AI game. The hub, created in December, inherited 20 years of pharmacy and hospital data, and in April an emergency law was signed for gathering virus data.The hub will be the central point for data from the country’s clinical trials, prescriptions and disabilities research. For a fee, academics, private companies, and health authorities will be able to analyze the data. EY’s health expert Loic Chabanier said France’s data value could be “potentially colossal” -- from benefits for the health-care system to royalties on molecules and licenses.Governments from France and Finland to Germany and Italy have been collecting health data for decades, but the pandemic focused attention on the need to use the data to make medical and economic decisions in weeks rather then years.“All this is a competitive advantage, eventually,” Jukka Lahesmaa, a senior adviser to Finland’s Ministry of Health and Social Affairs, said in an interview. “It will change the economy of health data in Europe. The EU data space will bring clarity and standards.”Now the hub is being criticized. Privacy lawyers and activists too much data was taken concerning Covid-19 data from hospitals, pharmacies, labs and care-house records. The privacy watchdog CNIL said it was worried about potential data transfers to the US after the hub picked Microsoft to host the data.“We’ve made sure it can be reversible, to be able to change tomorrow, if needed,” Combes said, alluding to the Microsoft contract following queries from France’s top court.In the UK, which is ahead in its health data digitization, the NHS started issuing licenses about two years ago -- without sufficient privacy safeguards, critics say. Transfers of UK health data are also in the balance of trade talks with the US Amazon, Google, Microsoft and Palantir Technologies Inc. have signed contracts with the NHS to process virus-related data, and attracted the attention of privacy activists.Similar projects are emerging elsewhere in Europe.

23-06-2020||World||After Tulsa, Trump heads to virus hotspot Arizona and border||Regrouping after a humbling weekend rally, President Donald Trump faces another test of his ability to draw a crowd during a pandemic Tuesday as he visits Arizona and tries to remind voters of one of his key 2016 campaign promises.Trump’s weekend rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, had been meant to be a sign of the nation’s reopening and a show of political force but instead generated thousands of empty seats and swirling questions about the president’s campaign leadership and his case for another four years in office. The low turnout has sharpened the focus on Trump’s visit to Arizona, which doubles as both a 2020 battleground state and a surging coronavirus hotspot.First, the president will travel to Yuma to mark the construction of more than 200 miles of wall along the US-Mexico border, an issue that he built his campaign on four years ago. Later, he’ll address a group of young Republicans at a Phoenix megachurch, where event organizers have pledged thousands will attend.Throughout the trip, the Covid-19 pandemic will shadow Trump. The Democratic mayor of Phoenix made clear that she does not believe the speech can be safely held in her city — and urged the president to wear a face mask.“Everyone attending tomorrow’s event, particularly any elected official, should set an example to residents by wearing a mask,” said Mayor Kate Gallego. “This includes the President.”Trump has refused to wear a mask in public, instead turning it into a red-vs.-blue cultural issue. Polling suggests that Republican are far less likely to wear a face covering than Democrats despite health experts’ warnings that it dramatically reduces the risk of transmitting the virus.The “Students for Trump” event will be held at the Dream City Church and broadcast to groups across the nation. It is being hosted by Turning Point USA, a group founded by Trump ally Charlie Kirk. Organizers said health and safety measures still were being finalized and it was not clear if attendees would be asked to wear masks or keep socially distant.Since late May, Arizona has emerged as one of the nation’s most active hotspots for the spread of Covid-19. Use of hospitals, intensive care units and ventilators has set daily records over the past week.Photos of restaurants and bars crowded with unmasked patrons ignited controversy. Republican Gov. Doug Ducey, a Trump supporter, reversed himself last week and allowed cities and counties to require people to wear masks in public places. Most have, including Phoenix and Yuma and the counties that surround them.Arizona is seeing disturbing trends in several benchmarks, including the percentage of tests that prove positive for the virus, which is the highest in the nation.The state’s positive test rate is at a seven-day average of 20.4%, well above the national average of 8.4% and the 10% level that public health officials say is a problem.Campaign officials are still assessing the fallout from low turnout in Tulsa amid concern about the virus.Campaign officials stressed that rallies would remain a staple of the president’s reelection strategy but allowed that they may, in certain states, need to change slightly. Discussions were under way about having them in more modest venues or outdoors, perhaps in airplane hangers and amphitheaters, or in smaller cities away from likely protesters.But officials believe that Trump’s ability to draw thousands of supporters out during a pandemic sets up a favorable contrasting image with Democratic rival Joe Biden. Still, the campaign has struggled to find effective attack lines on Biden.Biden, like Trump, has had struggles with young voters but the former vice president’s campaign has expressed hope that the national protests against racial injustice may change that.Trump’s visit to the Phoenix megachurch will come on the same day that Pence kicks off a faith-centered tour, highlighting the central position that religious conservatives -– particularly white evangelicals, but also right-leaning Catholics -– continue to occupy in the president’s base. Yet even as Trump’s campaign overtly courts religious voters, there are signs of softening support among voting blocs the president can’t afford to lose.A poll released earlier this month by the nonprofit Public Religion Research Institute found that the share of white Catholics viewing Trump favorably had fallen by double digits since last year, measuring 37% in the last week of May compared with 49% across 2019. The same poll found Trump’s favorability among white evangelicals at 62% in May, a level comparable to 2019’s — but 15% less than it was in March.Trump’s focus on construction of his long-promised border wall also is meant to shore up support with his most loyal supporters.His administration has promised to build 450 miles by the end of the year, but that’s not very likely. The government has awarded more than $6.1 billion in construction contracts since April 2019 for various projects along the border. It has also waived procurement rules that critics say make the process of awarding multi-million dollar contracts secretive and opaque.The White House this month floated a theory that travel from Mexico may be contributing to a new wave of coronavirus infections, rather than states’ efforts to reopen their economies. It was not clear that the evidence supports the theory.Trump’s first visit to the border in more than a year comes a day after another hardline immigration move. The Trump administration said Monday that it was extending a ban on green cards issued outside the United States until the end of the year and adding many temporary work visas to the freeze, including those used heavily by technology companies and multinational corporations.The administration cast the effort as a way to free up jobs in an economy reeling from the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/after-tulsa-trump-heads-to-virus-hotspot-arizona-and-border/story-Uun0bij7JXGuCtNGOV2vYM.html
23-06-2020||World||Russia stares down World War II controversies 75 years on||The Soviet victory over Nazi Germany in 1945 is a pillar of national pride in Russia, used by the Kremlin to stir patriotic sentiment and rebuff criticism of the USSR and its army.Yet Russia’s state-backed narratives about the war and its legacy regularly lead to disagreements with other European countries.Russia celebrates its victory in World War II every year on May 9 with a massive military parade on Red Square in front of the president and other world leaders.Ahead of this year’s parade on Wednesday, postponed from May because of the coronavirus pandemic, here are five World War II episodes that continue to fuel tensions. Pact with HitlerThe 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop pact between Soviet leader Joseph Stalin and Nazi leader Adolf Hitler remains a point of contention between Moscow and European countries to this day.World War II erupted after Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union invaded and carved up Poland in September 1939 under a secret clause of the pact.The agreement, which remained classified in the Soviet Union until 1989, has been described by Putin as necessary because Western powers had abandoned the USSR to face Germany alone.He has also lauded the pact as a triumph of Stalin-era diplomacy.Putin was angered last year by a text published by the European Parliament saying the pact helped pave the way for World War II.Invasion or liberation?Soviet soldiers are celebrated in Russia for liberating Europe from Nazism, but for some countries in eastern Europe the Red Army is remembered as an occupying force.The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were forcibly integrated into the Soviet Union, and revile Nazi and Soviet forces alike.Lithuanian President Gitanas Nauseda said last month that the war did not end until 1993 “when the last Russian soldier left” his country. Russia says this narrative is an unacceptable rewriting of history and routinely protests at the removal of Soviet-era military monuments in eastern and central Europe.Polish massacreOne of many points of friction with Poland is the massacre at Katyn, named after a forest near the Russian city of Smolensk where Soviet secret police shot thousands of Polish officers in 1940 on Stalin’s orders.Until 1990, the Soviet Union claimed the executions were carried out by the Nazis.Moscow has since admitted responsibility, but the legacy of the massacre has been overshadowed in Russia by wider Stalinist repressions.In 2010, during a thaw in relations between Moscow and Warsaw, the plane carrying Poland’s president to a commemorative event in Smolensk crashed, killing all 96 people on board.Investigations into the accident have become a new source of tension between the two countries.Mass deportationsDuring the war, Stalin accused minority ethnic groups of collaborating with the Nazis and deported hundreds of thousands of Crimean Tatars, Kalmyks, Chechens, Balkars, Germans and others to Central Asia in harsh conditions.Deported populations were rehabilitated after Stalin’s death, but tensions linger with those that returned.Crimean Tatars, for instance, were deported from their homes and as a result opposed Russia’s annexation of the Crimea peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.Many Soviet soldiers and officers returning home after captivity in Germany were also likened to traitors and sent to forced labour camps.Rape in GermanyRapes committed by Soviet soldiers as they captured Berlin in April 1945 permeated German collective memory, but are largely overlooked in Russia.A Russian blogger in January was charged with “Nazi apologism” for satirical social media posts that referenced Soviet abuses committed in Germany.In 2016, a newspaper in the Russian enclave of Kaliningrad was handed an official warning over an article about atrocities committed by the Red Army during the takeover of the German city in 1945.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-stares-down-world-war-ii-controversies-75-years-on/story-G90hBGMGqOGhQzXBpSwgPN.html
23-06-2020||World||US accuses India of unfair practices on charter flights||The US Transportation Department on Monday accused the Indian government of engaging in “unfair and discriminatory practices” on charter air transportation services to and from India and issued an order requiring Indian air carriers to apply for authorization prior to conducting charter flights.The order will allow US officials “to scrutinize charter flights by Indian carriers on a case-by-case basis.” The department said it “seeks to restore a level playing field for US airlines” under the US-India Air Transport Agreement. The Indian government, citing the coronavirus, has banned all scheduled services and failed to approve US carriers for charter operations, the department said.The Indian embassy in Washington did not immediately comment. The order is effective July 22.The department previously accused China of unfairly denying US air carriers the ability to conduct flights and also demanded China seek preapproval for some charter flights.The US government said Air India has been operating what it calls “repatriation” charter flights between India and the United States in both directions since May 7.Air India is advertising flights “that would constitute a rate of 53% of the scheduled services it operated before the onset of the current public health emergency,” the department said.“Considering this rate of flying, and that Air India is selling tickets on the market, the charters go beyond true repatriations, and it appears that Air India may be using repatriation charters as a way of circumventing the GoI-imposed prohibition of scheduled services.”The US government first raised objections with the Indian government through engagement by the US Embassy New Delhi on May 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-accuses-india-of-unfair-practices-on-charter-flights/story-YM5c2Iu4R9RazKxxNWqr2L.html
23-06-2020||World||Trump says China trade deal still on after adviser Peter Navarro’s remarks||President Donald Trump is tweeting that an initial trade agreement with China is still on after a top White House adviser’s comments seemed to suggest it was over, spooking markets late Monday.Trump tweeted: “The China Trade Deal is fully intact. Hopefully they will continue to live up to the terms of the Agreement!”The Trump administration has been extremely critical of China’s efforts to contain the novel coronavirus early on and the president repeatedly blames China for the pandemic in his remarks, leading to questions about future cooperation in areas such as trade.Peter Navarro, director of trade and manufacturing policy at the White House, told Fox News “it’s over,” when asked a question that was focused on the China trade deal.“(Trump) obviously really wanted to hang onto this trade deal as much as possible. And he wanted them to make good on the promises, because there had been progress made on that trade deal, but given everything that’s happened and all the things you just listed, is that over?” Navarro was asked.“It’s over, yes,” Navarro replied.But when contacted by The Associated Press, Navarro said his comments had been taken out of context and had nothing to do with the deal.“I was simply speaking to the lack of trust we now have of the Chinese Communist Party after they lied about the origins of the China virus and foisted a pandemic upon the world,” said Navarro, a longtime critic of the Asian country.In January, the US and China reached an interim trade deal to reduce tariff tensions. China agreed to buy massive amounts of US products.United States Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer testified on Capitol Hill last week that he is confident China will live up to its purchase commitments even though its economy has been weakened by the coronavirus pandemic and the lockdowns and travel restrictions imposed to contain it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-says-china-trade-deal-still-on-after-adviser-peter-navarro-s-remarks/story-KPgj54j9ACpcYHrw57X2rO.html
23-06-2020||World||Trump targets foreign workers with new visa freeze: Who is affected||US President Donald Trump on Monday signed an executive order suspending the entry of certain foreign workers by extending the pause on some Green Cards. The new order also covers H-1B, the most sought-after visa programme by Indians to gain entry in the United States as skilled immigrants.The move came as Republican Trump launches his re-election bid for presidential polls scheduled in November. Her has made immigration as his poll pitch.The White House said that this pause will benefit workers in America where job losses due to the coronavirus pandemic are at record high. The government data says nearly 50 million Americans have lost jobs due to Covid-19, and this new order will free up just 5.25 lakh jobs.Apart from the H-1B visa holders, Trump’s new order will also affect other categories of workers. These are:H2-B: This visa programme is for seasonal non-agricultural labour. The United States issues 66,000 H2-B visas per year. The US media reports that this category is Trump’s favourite and visas under this programme are valid for up to three years. Food processing, hotel work and landscaping industries make use of the H2-B visa programme to employ workers for companies in these sectors. In 2019, the US issued 97,623 H-2B visas for both new applicants and renewals.H-4: This programme is for the spouses of H1-B and H2-B visa holders. The H-4 visas are valid for the duration of the H1-B visa. THe US government issued 1,25,999 H-4 visas last year. Out of these, nearly 1,06,162 were for Indian citizens, followed by 5,701 for Chinese citizens.J-1: These are meant for people who want to visit the United States for cultural and educational exchange. They are valid for up to seven years, depending on programme type, and there is no annual cap. In 2019, the US government issued 3,53,279 J-1 visas for both new applicants and renewals.J-2: Like H2-B, this visa is for the spouses and dependents of J-1 holders. It is valid for the duration of the J-1 visa. Over 38,000 J-2 visas were issued by the Trump administration in 2019, according to government data.L-1: These are the visas are for high-level and specialised company employees. They are generally valid for up to seven years and there is no annual cap. In 2019, the US government issued 76,988 L-1 visas. Out of these, 18,354 were taken by Indian citizens.L-2: The L-2 visas are given to the dependents of L-1 holders. They are valid for the duration of the associated L-1 visa. The Indians got 23,169 L-2 visas out of the totl 80,720 issued by the US government last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-targets-foreign-workers-with-new-visa-freeze-who-is-affected/story-k8GSbelbTSjJMk7RI3Z9oL.html
23-06-2020||World||South Korean activist floats leaflets to North amid high tensions||A South Korean activist on Tuesday said hundreds of thousands of leaflets had been launched by balloon across the border with North Korea overnight, after the North repeatedly warned it would retaliate against such actions.The move is certain to intensify tensions between the Koreas, after the North abruptly raised its rhetoric against South Korean civilian leafleting and pushed to resume its psychological warfare against the South.Police in the South Korean border town of Paju said Tuesday they were checking into details about the reported leafleting.Activist Park Sang-hak said his organization flew huge balloons carrying 500,000 leaflets, 2,000 one-dollar bills and small books on North Korea from Paju on Monday night.Park, formerly a North Korean who fled to South Korea, said in a statement his leafleting is “a struggle for justice for the sake of liberation of” North Korean residents.Calling North Korean leader Kim Jong Un “an evil” and his rule “barbarism,” Park said he’ll keep sending anti-Kim leaflets despite worries about his safety. “Though North Korean residents have become modern-day slaves with no basic rights, don’t they have the rights to know the truth?” he said.South Korean officials have vowed to ban leafleting and said they would press charges against Park, who has sent leaflets toward North Korea for years.Authorities said Park’s activities are unnecessarily raising animosities between the Koreas and potentially endangering residents in border areas. In 2014, North Korean troops opened fire at propaganda balloons flying toward their territory, triggering an exchange of fire that caused no known causalities.Last week, North Korea blew up an inter-Korean liaison office on its territory and threatened to take unspecified steps to nullify 2018 agreements aimed at lowering front-line military tensions. On Monday, North Korea’s state media said it had manufactured 12 million propaganda leaflets to be floated toward South Korea in what it said would be the largest-ever anti-Seoul leafleting campaign.Experts say North Korea is likely using the South Korean civilian leafleting as a chance to boost its internal unity and apply more pressures on Seoul and Washington amid stalled nuclear diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-activist-floats-leaflets-to-north-amid-high-tensions/story-5s6t4RdfHWjyJ8tNcPjorM.html
23-06-2020||World||China launches final satellite in GPS-like Beidou system||China on Tuesday launched the final satellite in its Beidou constellation that emulates the US Global Positioning System, marking a further step in the country’s advance as a major space power.The launch of the satellite onboard a Long March-3 rocket was broadcast live from the satellite launch base of Xichang, deep in the mountains of southwestern China, shortly before 10 a.m. About half an hour later, the satellite was deployed in orbit and extended its solar panels to provide its energy.An initial launch scheduled for last week was scrubbed after checks revealed unspecified technical problems.The third iteration of the Beidou Navigation Satellite System promises to provide global coverage for timing and navigation, offering an alternative to Russia’s GLONASS and the European Galileo systems, as well as America’s GPS.China’s space program has developed rapidly over the past two decades as the government devotes major resources toward developing independent high-tech capabilities — and even dominating in fields such as 5G data processing.The first version of Beidou, meaning “Big Dipper,” was decommissioned in 2012. Future plans call for a smarter, more accessible and more integrated system with Beidou at its core, to come online by 2035.In 2003, China became just the third country to independently launch a crewed space mission and has since constructed an experimental space station and sent a pair of rovers to the surface of the moon.Future plans call for a fully functioning permanent space station and a possible crewed flight to the moon, with its first attempt to send an orbiter and rover to Mars possibly coming as early as next month. If successful, it would be the only other country besides the US to land on Earth’s closest planetary neighbor.The program has suffered some setbacks, including launch failures, and has had limited cooperation with other countries’ space efforts, in part because of US objections to its close connections to the Chinese military.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-final-satellite-in-gps-like-beidou-system/story-W96CRnCNdU46ADnLAO5JgK.html
23-06-2020||World||Protesters try to bring down Andrew Jackson statue near White House||Protesters tried to tear down a statue of former US President Andrew Jackson on Monday near the White House, scrawling “killer scum” on the base and pulling at ropes around the figure of Jackson on a horse before police intervened.Video footage posted to social media also showed demonstrators climbing on the bronze monument in Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House, in the latest bid to destroy images of historical figures considered racist or divisive.Police in riot gear are then seen moving in to drive the crowd back and form a protective ring around the statue, which was erected in 1852 on a white marble base and depicts Jackson astride a rearing horse.Earlier, protesters clashed with police in the nearby streets, the latest in a string of demonstrations against police brutality and racism following the death of a 46-year-old Black man, George Floyd, under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer.Jackson, the seventh US president, was a former general in the US Army and a populist politician nicknamed “Old Hickory,” whose political style has sometimes been compared with that of President Donald Trump.Native American activists have long criticized Jackson, a Democrat, for signing during his 1829-37 presidency the Indian Removal Act, in which thousands of people were driven from their land by the US government.Forced to march West in what was described as the “Trail of Tears,” thousands of Native Americans died before reaching their intended destination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-try-to-bring-down-andrew-jackson-statue-near-white-house/story-Ba5ct9gMZ0m5Ypr4i2kqtM.html
23-06-2020||World||H-1B visa programme explained and what it means for Indians||US President Donald Trump has decided to extend the suspension of immigration and expand it to cover H-1B, most sought-after visa programme among the Indians.The decision has been taken to ensure Americans have the first shot at the jobs in the wake of record job losses due to the coronavirus pandemic.The executive order signed by Trump will be in place at least until the end of the year. Critics of the measure say Trump is using the pandemic to enact his long standing goal to limit immigration into the United States. Republican Trump is running for re-election on November 3 and has made his tough immigration stance a central pitch to voters.A senior Department of Homeland Security official said the proclamation will not affect valid visa holders already in the United States.What is the H-1B visa programme?It is a non-immigrant visa programme for highly skilled foreign workers. Indians are the largest beneficiaries of the programme, getting more than 70 per cent of the 85,000 given out annually by the United States.The H-1B is the largest guest worker programme in the United States, and an important channel for high-skilled immigrants to get into the country. It allows companies to employ foreign workers in occupations that require technical expertise in areas that are difficult to fill. The H-1B programme has benefitted the tech industry enormously.The process to get the H-1B visasThe programme is employer-driven. This means that companies tell the US government that they need these visas for certain specialised roles. The companies also promise the new workers under the programme will not be given salaries less than their American counterparts. And that the foreign workers will not adversely affect the working condition of other workers.The criticismPresident Trump and immigration hardliners argue that the present system is being abused to bring foreign workers on low wages to displace Americans, instead of attracting the really talented as its original mandate. The Trump administration also points towards a “loophole” in the system that allowed companies to hire foreign workers and then “domestically outsource” them to other companies, replacing their American workers. They do so by bypassing a rule prohibiting the hiring of a foreign worker if it directly led to the firing of an American worker. Outsourcing through a third-party personnel system is critical to the business model of Indian IT services companies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/h1-b-visa-programme-explained-and-what-it-means-for-indians/story-OJa6FGO4DysWoyIp1noztI.html

She said the case was being studied to see whether the triplets were infected before or after birth was being conducted, but said it appeared improbable they could have been infected outside the womb so quickly.It is not the first time newborns have tested positive for the virus, but it is rare.Nationwide, Mexico’s confirmed coronavirus cases rose by 4,577 to 185,122, and the confirmed death toll rose by 759 to 22,584.Both numbers are considered significant undercounts due to Mexico’s very low levels of testing. Officials said that levels of infections appear to have stabilized, and held out hopes, as they have many times before, that the numbers may start declining soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-triplets-test-positive-for-virus-on-day-of-birth/story-mtMhFLBbgKyKc7elTNvpIN.html

23-06-2020||World||Joe Biden’s campaign commits to 3 general election debates||Joe Biden’s campaign said Monday that the presumptive Democratic nominee would commit to participating in three debates, and slammed a push by President Trump’s advisers for an additional debate as an “effort to change the subject.”“Our position is straightforward and clear: Joe Biden will accept the Commission’s debates, on the Commission’s dates, under the Commission’s established format and the Commission’s independent choice of moderators,” said Biden Campaign Manager Jen O’Malley Dillon in a letter to the Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonprofit group that sponsors general election debates, which was obtained by The Associated Press. “Donald Trump and Mike Pence should do the same.”“Any ‘debate proposals’ in lieu of that are just an effort to change the subject, avoid debates, or create a distracting ‘debate about debates,’” she added.The letter, which was first reported by The Washington Post, came in response to a request made by Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to add another, earlier debate to the current schedule of three. They also proposed that each campaign have a role in selecting the debate moderators.Trump’s team noted absentee and mail voting is being expanded because of the Covid-19 pandemic and expressed concern that some ballots — especially those by elderly voters most at risk to the virus — could be cast before the first debate. The first is scheduled for Sept. 29 at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, the second on October 15 at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, and the third for a week later, Oct. 22, at Belmont University in Nashville, Tenn.The seeming acceptance that a vast number of this year’s votes will be cast by mail marks a change for the campaign. Both Giuliani and Trump have criticized widespread mail voting and claimed without evidence that mail ballots are ripe for fraud.In the Monday letter, O’Malley Dillon also pointed out that the Trump campaign’s request for more debates marked a shift from December, when advisers were threatening that Trump might skip the debates altogether.That shift comes as Trump’s campaign has been seeking to paint Biden as mentally unsuited for the presidency, pointing to some of his verbal flubs on the campaign trail and lambasting the former vice president for campaigning “from his basement” during the pandemic, as Trump hit the campaign trail for his first rally during the pandemic this past weekend.Indeed, in a statement on the Biden campaign’s refusal to engage in additional debates, Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh charged that his aides were “afraid” to send the Democrat out in unscripted situations, noting it’s been more than 80 days since Biden held a press conference.“An earlier and longer debate schedule is necessary so Americans can see the clear difference between President Trump’s vibrant leadership and Biden’s confused meandering,” he said.In the Monday letter, O’Malley also asked that the CPD confirm that it’s formulating safety plans to ensure that the debates will go on despite the coronavirus pandemic, and that the second debate be held in a town hall format, which would allow voters to ask questions of each candidate.“The Trump campaign proposal for elaborate negotiations is merely an effort to dodge fair, even-handed debates,” O’Malley Dillon wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-campaign-commits-to-3-general-election-debates/story-Zo8Zn30GFULA9vWVnS6MnJ.html
23-06-2020||World||Canadian PM Trudeau says China using detentions to advance political goals||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau strongly reacted to China’s “arbitrary” imprisonment of two Canadian citizens, including a former diplomat accusing the nation of using these detentions to advance its “political goals.”China has denied that the detentions of Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig are not connected to the arrest of Chinese telecommunications firm Huawei’s CFO Meng Wanzhou in Vancouver in December 2018. Analysts have continued to accuse China of using the detentions as a lever to try and get her freed. Meng, daughter of Huawei’s founder Ren Zhengfei, is facing a trial that may culminate in her extradition to the United States, in a case related to defrauding a bank to illegally conduct business with the Iranian regime.Ren Zhengfei, is facing a trial that may culminate in her extradition to the United States, in a case related to defrauding a bank to illegally conduct business with the Iranian regime.While Trudeau did not react to a query related to ‘hostage diplomacy’ during the daily media briefing, he was far more direct than in the past in confronting China, as he said, “It has been obvious since the beginning this was a political decision by the Chinese government, and we deplore it.”He stressed that China had made those “links” between the Meng case and those involving the two Canadians, who were charged with spying last week by Chinese prosecutors, and “continue to put political pressure on Canada” by connecting them. He asserted that the “use of arbitrary detentions as a means to advance political goals is fully unacceptable in a world based on rules.”How the escalation of friction between Ottawa and Beijing has become a major political matter in Canada and has featured prominently in Trudeau’s interaction with other world leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

23-06-2020||World||With unsubstantiated claim, Trump sows doubt on US election||President Donald Trump opened a new front Monday in his fight against mail-in voting, making unsubstantiated assertions that foreign countries will print up millions of bogus ballots to rig the results and create what he called the “scandal of our times.”The claims not only ignore safeguards that states have implemented to prevent against widespread fraud but they also risk undermining Americans’ faith in the election, spreading the very kind of disinformation US authorities have warned foreign adversaries could exploit to foment doubt in the voting process.Trump accelerated his attacks following a bruising weekend for his reelection campaign, when a lower-than-expected turnout at a rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, left him seething, and as he fights for a second term during the worst unemployment since the Great Depression. The rhetoric, coming as states scramble to adjust voting processes because of the coronavirus pandemic, represents a two-track approach of trying to both block mail-in balloting in advance and setting the stage for challenging the results once it’s over.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“It’s a way of trying to turn the foreign interference claims that have been made on their head,” said Richard Hasen, an election law expert at the University of California, Irvine. “Typically we’ve heard that the Russian government and others were working to help elect Trump, and here is Trump using fears of foreign interference as a way of bolstering his own side.”“This potentially lays the groundwork,” he added, “for him contesting election results.”Though election records obtained by The Associated Press show that a half-dozen senior advisers to the president have voted by mail, others in the administration have recently promoted the notion that states could be inundated with fraudulent ballots from overseas.Attorney General William Barr raised that prospect in interviews in recent weeks with The New York Times Magazine and Fox News.“Right now, a foreign country could print up tens of thousands of counterfeit ballots, and be very hard for us to detect which was the right and which was the wrong ballot,” Barr told Fox in an interview that aired Sunday.The president tweeted Monday a news report on Barr’s remarks as well as a separate message that said: “RIGGED 2020 ELECTION: MILLIONS OF MAIL-IN BALLOTS WILL BE PRINTED BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND OTHERS. IT WILL BE THE SCANDAL OF OUR TIMES!”But experts say that doomsday scenario is far-fetched.“Comments like that demonstrate an ignorance of by-mail voting and the technology associated with how it actually works,” said Eddie Perez, global director of technology development at the OSET Institute, a nonprofit technology research corporation.“There are more protocols than people are probably aware of, which would make such an attack rather difficult,” he added.Though fraud in absentee balloting is rare, that’s not to say that there aren’t more pedestrian problems that could arise as people vote by the mail, including ballots that are intercepted in a mailbox and tampered with. The National Conference of State Legislatures lists on its website multiple disadvantages to the process, including slower reporting of results and the possibility that voters could be coerced by family or friends.But the list doesn’t broach the idea of foreign countries manufacturing their own ballots — a type of fraud that would encounter significant practical obstacles, not least because states say they are adept at differentiating legitimate ballots from inauthentic ones.The ballots used by Colorado’s 64 individual counties are printed exclusively in the United States, distinguished by specific colors and target areas and processed through sensitive scanners designed to weed out the inauthentic, said Secretary of State Jena Griswold. A bipartisan team of election judges conducts signature verification and refers for further investigation suspected instances of double-voting.And in Washington state, each county is responsible for printing its own ballots and distributing them to voters, whose signatures on the return ballot are cross-checked against the signature on voter registration applications.“My experience doing this is that usually when people get creative with things like that, you can tell,” Washington Secretary of State Kim Wyman said in an interview.Five states — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah and Washington — conduct elections entirely by mail, according to the NCSL. But nearly all states, led by Democratic and Republican governors alike, offer some form of the option.With health officials saying that voting by mail can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus, many states are moving ahead with plans that ease access to mail-in ballots. Wisconsin recently decided this week to send absentee ballot requests to nearly all voters. Michigan, another swing state, has taken that step as well.That trend has agitated Trump, who even before Monday has openly railed against absentee voting. He told Politico in an interview published Friday that the “biggest risk” to his reelection is the growing use of mail-in ballots, and suggested that his chances may hinge on whether he can prevail in court against efforts to make absentee voting easier.By Monday, he was tweeting that this year would be the “most RIGGED election” in American history and blasted unspecified people or states who he said were “using Covid in order to cheat by using Mail-Ins!”It was the type of rhetoric that alarmed election security experts, but was even cautioned against by a Republican-led Senate committee in a report earlier this year on Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.“Sitting officials and candidates should use the absolute greatest amount of restraint and caution if they are considering publicly calling the validity of an upcoming election into question,” the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-unsubstantiated-claim-trump-sows-doubt-on-us-election/story-7JshnWPKWnN5n9Muk2ctBO.html

The area has drawn President Donald Trump’s scorn.On Sunday night, a 17-year-old was shot in the arm at the edge of the area known as CHOP, named for the Capitol Hill neighborhood near downtown. It followed a shooting Saturday that left a 19-year-old man dead and another person critically wounded.Protesters cordoned off the several-block area near a police station after clashes with officers following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. Seattle riot squads unleashed tear gas, pepper spray and flash-bangs on large crowds of mostly peaceful protesters, drawing condemnation from many city leaders and a federal court order temporarily banning the use of the weapons on demonstrators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seattle-to-move-to-dismantle-protest-zone-mayor-says/story-NArd1hmYTSGm9K7DA3pdON.html

A proclamation of Trump on Monday temporarily suspended till the end of the current year a number of popular non-immigrant visas including the H-1B, H-4, H-2B visa, J and L visas. “The H-1B is the high-tech visa. H-4 is the spouses of certain other visa holders, including H-1B and H-2B. H-2B is a bit of a low-skill catchall. The only ones that’ll come in under the H-2B will be those in the food service industry, which is less than 15 per cent of all H-2Bs.” “Then, almost all working J visas will be excluded, and then all L visas. Ls are intra-company transfers from, say, company X, their facility in Germany to their facility in Michigan,” the official said. While maintaining the integrity of the asylum system, the president has closed a bunch of those loopholes, which, in addition to cleaning up the asylum system, will also free up more jobs for Americans. “That is done by regulation, however, not by the executive order,” the official said. Trump in his lengthy proclamation has directed the Department of Homeland Security to eliminate work permits of those who have final orders of removal or commit crimes in the United States or are deportable. The category alone is in excess of 50,000 jobs a year that will be opened up for Americans, the official said. The White House later said that the proclamation is part of the ‘America first recovery’ effort of Trump as he is expanding the suspension of certain visas through the end of the year to ensure American workers take first priority as the country recovers from the economic effects of the coronavirus. Noting that Trump is extending the pause on new immigrant visas through the end of the year to ensure that the US continues putting American workers first during the ongoing coronavirus recovery, the White House said the president is building on this measure with an additional pause on several job-related nonimmigrant visas—H-1Bs, H-2Bs without a nexus to the food-supply chain, certain H-4s, as well as Ls and certain Js—preserving jobs for American citizens. Asserting that this will ensure businesses look to American workers first when hiring, the White House said that many workers have been hurt through no fault of their own due to coronavirus and they should not remain on the sidelines while being replaced by new foreign labour. “The Trump administration has also finalised regulations to eliminate the incentive to file an asylum application for the primary purpose of obtaining an employment authorisation document. With some exceptions, we should not permit large numbers of foreign workers to enter the United States at a time when so many Americans are out of work,” the White House said. The White House asserted that American people stand by Trump as he takes commonsense action to preserve jobs for American citizens. “Polls show that the overwhelming majority of Americans support pausing immigration as we recover as a nation from the coronavirus pandemic,” it said. A Washington Post-University of Maryland poll found that 65 per cent of those polled support pausing immigration into the country, including 61 per cent of minority respondents. A Pew Research Center poll found that 81 percent of Americans see mass immigration as a threat as we confront the challenges posed by the coronavirus, it added. “Democrats and liberal commentators used to support such commonsense efforts to protect American jobs,” the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspension-of-foreign-work-visas-to-free-up-to-5-25-lakh-jobs-in-us-white-house/story-891XusqbXCBR3whgt5zamJ.html
23-06-2020||World||Saudi Arabia to hold ‘very limited’ hajj due to Covid-19 pandemic||Saudi Arabia said Tuesday that because of the coronavirus only “very limited numbers” of people will be allowed to perform the annual hajj pilgrimage that traditionally draws around 2 million Muslims from around the world.The decision comes after weeks of speculation over whether Saudi Arabia would cancel the pilgrimage altogether or allow the hajj to be held in symbolic numbers. It’s unclear why the government waited until just five weeks before the hajj to announce its decision, but the timing indicates the sensitivity around major decisions concerning the hajj that affect Muslims around the world.Saudi kings have for generations assumed titles as custodians of Islam’s holiest sites, and their oversight of the hajj is a source of prestige and influence among Muslims globally. The hajj also generates around $6 billion in revenue for the government every year.Saudi Arabia has never cancelled the hajj in the nearly 90 years since the country was founded.The government said its decision to drastically limit the number of pilgrims was aimed at preserving global public health due to the lack of a vaccine for the virus or a cure for those infected, as well as the risks associated with large gatherings of people.The hajj is one of the biggest gatherings on earth, with pilgrims staying in close confines and walking and praying shoulder-to-shoulder. A stampede in 2015 caused more than 2,400 deaths.“This decision was taken to ensure hajj is performed in a safe manner from a public health perspective,” the government statement said.The kingdom’s Ministry of Hajj said only people of various nationalities already residing in the country would be allowed to perform the large pilgrimage, which is set to begin this year at the end of July.The government did not specify how many people would be permitted to take part.The hajj centers around five intense days of worship and rituals in Mecca, however pilgrims typically begin arriving to Saudi Arabia through its main gateway city of Jiddah weeks and even months in advance.Saudi Arabia said its “top priority is to always enable Muslim pilgrims to perform the hajj and umrah rites safely and securely.”It defended its decision on religious grounds, as well, saying that the teachings of Islam require the preservation of human life. Saudi Arabia’s top council of clerics swiftly issued a statement saying the decision is line with Islamic Shariah law.Performing the hajj is central to Islam and one of the religion’s five pillars. All able-bodied Muslims are required to perform the hajj once in their lifetime, with many saving money their entire lives to afford the journey.The hajj is seen as a chance to wipe clean past sins and start fresh. Pilgrims shed symbols of materialism, as women forgo makeup and perfume and wear loose-fitting clothing and a head covering, while men dress in seamless, white terrycloth garments meant to emphasize the equality of all Muslims before God.Despite taking early and unprecedented measures to control the spread of the virus domestically, Saudi Arabia has one of the highest rates of coronavirus infections in the Middle East, with more than 161,000 total confirmed cases and 1,307 deaths.The virus causes mild to moderate symptoms in most people, who recover within a few weeks. But it is highly contagious and can cause severe illness or death, particularly in older patients or those with underlying health problems.Saudi Arabia had already suspended the smaller year-round umrah pilgrimage earlier this year and closed the Grand Mosque in Mecca, home to Islam’s holiest site, to the public. The city of Mecca was also under a strict 24-hour curfew for more than two months.Although Saudi Arabia has lifted some restrictions in recent days, the umrah continues to be suspended and the country’s borders remain shut to visitors and tourists.Indonesia and Malaysia, which combined send around a quarter-million Muslims to the hajj each year, had already announced they would not be sending their citizens to the pilgrimage this year, in part because it had become too late to prepare for it.In an early indication of the uncertainty around this year’s hajj, the kingdom had asked Muslims in early April to delay making plans for the pilgrimage as the virus grew into a global pandemic, infecting millions around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-arabia-to-hold-very-limited-hajj-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-CYTssUi4Yb7XyxBKht4vaM.html
23-06-2020||World||US doing ‘too good a job’ on Covid-19 testing, says Donald Trump||President Donald Trump said Monday the United States has done “too good a job” on testing for cases of Covid-19, even as his staff insisted the president was only joking when he said over the weekend that he had instructed aides to “slow the testing down, please.”The president’s comments at a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, on Saturday brought quick rebukes from the campaign of likely Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden as well as scores of Democratic lawmakers.In an interview with Scripps for its local TV stations, Trump was asked Monday whether he did indeed tell aides to “slow it down.” He did not directly answer the question.“If it did slow down, frankly, I think we’re way ahead of ourselves, if you want to know the truth,” Trump said. “We’ve done too good a job,” adding that the reason the United States has more coronavirus cases is that it does more testing.White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said any suggestion that testing has been curtailed is not rooted in fact, saying Trump made the slow-it-down comment “in jest.”She said that Trump’s comments were an effort to criticize the media for its coverage of the coronavirus and its “failure” to understand that “when you test more, you also find more cases.”However, the US is seeing disturbing trends in several benchmarks, including the percentage of tests that prove positive for the virus.Health officials say that testing in the United States early on was insufficient for optimal containment. In early March, Dr. Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, testified that the nation’s testing system was “not really geared to what we need right now” and added, “it is a failing. Let’s admit it.”But now, about a half-million people per day are being tested, and the president and his aides have been repeatedly touting the United States as leading the world in testing.Democratic Gov. Steve Sisolak of Nevada told Vice President Mike Pence in a conference call with governors on Monday that the president’s comments were not helpful and wanted assurances there is not a federal mandate to slow down testing. Pence told Sisolak and other governors on the call that the administration looked forward to continuing to partner with them on testing.The administration also stressed to governors on the call that states should be focusing resources on “hard to test” communities and that counties with high positivity rates should be saturated with more testing.Lawmakers are expected to have several questions about testing and the president’s comments on Tuesday when members of the administration’s coronavirus task force testify at a House hearing.“The American people are owed answers about why President Trump wants less testing when experts say much more is needed,” House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said.Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson called Trump’s rally remarks on discouraging testing “somewhat of a flippant comment” and said it’s not in line with what he’s heard from the administration.“It’s clear the national policy is to expand testing,” said Hutchinson, a Republican. “There again, you have to look at what is the action, what is the true policy versus just what the words are.”The United States has confirmed nearly 2.3 million Covid-19 cases, which represents about a quarter of the world’s cases. More than 120,000 people in the US with Covid-19 have died. The next closest nation is Brazil, with 50,600 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-doing-too-good-a-job-on-covid-19-testing-says-donald-trump/story-oJwfIpwiF3O2irQbO8UbuO.html
23-06-2020||World||Did TikTok teens, K-pop fans cause poor show at Trump campaign rally?||Several US media outlets, citing multiple sources close to the White House, said President Donald Trump was “furious” after his re-election campaign in Tulsa, Oklahoma was marred by empty seats. The White House had promised Saturday’s much-hyped event - Trump’s first rally in three months - would be flooded with up to 100,000 people, but large sections of the 19,000-capacity BOK Center were empty.The local fire department said only about 6,200 people were present, according to US media, but campaign officials claimed at least 12,000 attended.An outdoor event for the overflow crowd was cancelled because no one showed up, despite Trump’s team boasting of huge interest ahead of time and more than a million ticket requests.Did teens, TikTok users and fans of Korean pop music troll the president of the United States?For more than a week before Donald Trump’s first campaign rally in three months on Saturday in Tulsa, Oklahoma, these tech-savvy groups opposing the president mobilised to reserve tickets for an event they had no intention of attending.While it’s unlikely they were responsible for the low turnout, their antics may have inflated the campaign’s expectations for attendance numbers that led to Saturday’s disappointing show.“My 16 year old daughter and her friends in Park City Utah have hundreds of tickets. You have been rolled by America’s teens,” veteran Republican campaign strategist Steve Schmidt tweeted on Saturday.The tweet garnered more than 100,000 likes and many responses from people who say they or their kids did the same. Reached by telephone on Sunday, Schmidt called the rally an “unmitigated disaster” .CNN had reported last Tuesday that a TikTok video posted by Mary Jo Laupp, who uses the hashtag #TikTokGrandma, was helping lead the charge. The video now has more than 700,000 likes.Two K-pop fans who spoke to Reuters in Skype and phone interviews on Sunday said they had each registered for two spots, not using their real names and numbers. Em, a 17-year-old student in Kansas who only wanted to be identified by her username, said she had first heard about the effort on TikTok. She said many of the original tweets sharing information about the rally had been deleted. “I think it was partially the TikTokers and the K-pop fans but also people are not as interested in Trump as he thinks they are,” she said. Andrew Bates, a spokesperson for Trump’s Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, said the turnout was a sign of weakening voter support. “Donald Trump has abdicated leadership and it is no surprise that his supporters have responded by abandoning him,” he said.The Trump campaign blamed the “fake news media” for “warning people away from the rally”. “Leftists and online trolls doing a victory lap, thinking they somehow impacted rally attendance, don’t know what they’re talking about or how our rallies work,” Trump campaign chairman Brad Parscale wrote.  “Reporters who wrote gleefully about TikTok and K-Pop fans — without contacting the campaign for comment — behaved unprofessionally and were willing dupes to the charade,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/did-tiktok-teens-k-pop-fans-cause-poor-show-at-trump-campaign-rally/story-5StXvO1JxMRVMulpmgMmcJ.html
23-06-2020||World||US moves to restrict Chinese media outlets as ‘propaganda’||The Trump administration added four Chinese media outlets Monday to a list of organizations that should be considered “foreign missions” because of their ties to the government and the Communist Party, a move that could force some to cut staff in the U.S. and is likely to further aggravate relations between the two countries.State Department officials said the four organizations, including state-run CCTV, would be required to submit a list of everyone who works for them in the U.S. and any real estate holdings just as they would if they were foreign embassies or consulates.None are being ordered to leave the U.S. and no limits on their activities were announced. But five other Chinese organizations were directed to cap the number of people who could work in the United States in March — a month after they were designated as foreign missions.State Department officials said the organizations are essentially mouthpieces for the Communist Party and Chinese government, not legitimate news outlets.“The Communist Party does not just exercise operational control over these propaganda entities but has full editorial control over their content,” said Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia and Pacific Affairs David Stilwell. “This foreign mission designation is an obvious step in increasing transparency of these and other PRC government propaganda activities in the United States.”The other three added to the list of foreign missions are the China News Service, the People’s Daily newspaper and the Global Times.It was not yet clear how many journalists work in the U.S. for the organizations designated Monday.The U.S. designated Soviet outlets as foreign missions during the Cold War. That precedent reflects the bitter state of relations between the United States and China, which are at odds over the origin and response to the coronavirus, trade, human rights and other issues.President Donald Trump highlighted the dispute over the coronavirus when he spoke to a rally over the weekend in Tulsa, Oklahoma, and used a racist term for COVID-19, calling it the “kung flu.”White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany defended Trump’s use of the term Monday, telling reporters that the president was merely pointing out that the origin of the virus is China. “It’s a fair thing to point out as China tries to ridiculously rewrite history,” she said. “What President Trump is saying, ’no China, I will label this virus for its place of origin.’”U.S. officials say the designated media outlets should be considered foreign missions under American law because they are “substantially owned or effectively controlled” by the government of the People’s Republic of China and shouldn’t be treated like traditional news organizations.“These aren’t journalists. These are members of the propaganda apparatus in the PRC,” Stilwell said in a conference call with reporters.Asked about potential Chinese retaliation, Stilwell noted that American journalists working in China already faced tight restrictions on their activities.China had no immediate reaction to the announcement but the foreign ministry accused the administration of harboring a “Cold War mentality and ideological prejudice” when it applied the same designation to five media organizations earlier this year.At that time, the administration applied the label to the Xinhua News Agency, China Global Television Network, China Radio International, the China Daily Distribution Corporation, which distributes the newspaper of the same name, and Hai Tian Development USA, which distributes the People’s Daily newspaper.Then the U.S. administration capped the number of journalists from the five allowed to work in the U.S. at 100, down from about 160. At the time, the U.S. cited China’s increasingly harsh surveillance, harassment and intimidation of American and other foreign journalists in China.China announced in response that it would revoke the media credentials of all American journalists at The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post.___Associated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-moves-to-restrict-chinese-media-outlets-as-propaganda/story-rlOFV6ZquUsCabGn8ejzxO.html
23-06-2020||World||US President Donald Trump suspends H-1B and sets it up for overhaul||US President Donald Trump issued an executive order on Monday to extend the suspension of green cards till the end of the year and expand it to cover non-immigrant work visas such as H-1B, which, through a separate reform regulation at some future date, will also undergo a series of permanent overhauls to make it merit-based by prioritising highest paid applicants.Senior Trump administration officials said the suspended work visas included H-1B, H-4 for some H-1B spouses, H-2B for low skill workers, some categories of J visas for cultural and education workers and L-1 for intra-company transfers. They were intended to ensure Americans had the first shot at jobs in the aftermath of record job losses caused by Covid-19 related lockdowns, and are expected to free up 5,25,000 jobs.Also Read: H1-B visa programme explained and what it means for IndiansThe suspension of H-1B non-immigrant visas for highly skilled foreign workers had been widely expected and, as reported earlier by Hindustan Times, will impact Indians disproportionately as the largest beneficiaries of the programme, accounting for more than 70 per cent of the 85,000 given out annually. Vikram Desai, an IT professional cleared for green card, says he and his wife had looked at each other with dread when they first heard of the suspension order. “We have parents in the high-risk category of those vulnerable to Covid-19 and our first thoughts were that if one of us had to leave the US for India, we may not be able to return until the end of the year,” he said.Hundreds of Indians on H-1B or those approved for green cards had already been living away from their family or spouse for months now, stranded in India because of travel restrictions in force on either side, compounded by the closure of consular operations at US missions.Also read: Google CEO Sundar Pichai disappointed by Trump’s move to suspend foreign work visas“This is a Hindu Ban much like the Muslim Ban,” said one of them on condition of anonymity. The person was referring to the controversial ban imposed on the entry of people from some Muslim majority countries by Trump early on in his presidency, which remains in force, in a version diluted by legal challenges.It’s more like an India ban, actually. The H-1B suspension will affect Indians as the main beneficiaries, as stated earlier, and it will be Indians once again who will be hit the hardest by the suspension of H-4s that allow spouses of H-1B visa holders cleared for green card to work. Indians are the largest beneficiaries of this visa because the queue for green cards is the longest for Indians, current waiting time is statistically estimated to be over 100 years. H-4 was introduced by President Barack Obama in 2015 as an incentive for these green card hopefuls. The Trump administration wants to rescind it.Political observers linked the suspensions to Trump’s desire to seal the support of his base ahead of his re-election bid in November. Some conservatives have long viewed the work visa programmes, specially H-1B, as a threat for Americans, and Trump is tapping into it with these suspensions.Activists campaigning for a better deal for India H-1B visa holders in line for green card say an estimated two million Indians will be impacted by the suspensions, including H-1B visa holders, those waiting for their green cards and those on L-1. They claimed these were conservative estimated.Also Read: Suspension of foreign work visas to free up to 5.25 lakh jobs in US: White HouseLeon Fresco, a consultant for Immigration Voice, an advocacy group for green card hopefuls, wrote on Twitter legal that the suspension orders could be challenged in court.Chinese are the second largest beneficiaries of these programmes but they are already on notice from the Trump administration for Covid-19.Equally significant with lasting impact for Indian professionals wanting to work in the United States and Indian IT services companies will be the permanent changes that the US president is ordering, such as the way H-1B applicants are selected from among the hundreds of thousands that apply.The electronic lottery system, which is used to pick the 85,000 successful applicants from the total number of applicants that was three times more last year at 2,25,000, will now be replaced by a merit-based system that will prioritise highest salary applicants to “get the best and the brightest”, a senior Trump administration official told reporters in a background briefing ahead the issuance of the order.“So the top 85 (thousand) salary offers among the 2,25,000 or so applicants for those visas will get those visas,” the official added.President Trump has been calling for reforms in the H-1B visa programme to attract the best and brightest, echoing immigration hardliners who have argued that the present system is being abused to bring foreign workers on low wages to displace Americans, instead of attracting the really talented as its original mandate.The Trump administration will also seek to plug a “loophole” in the existing H-1B programme that allowed companies to hire foreign workers and then “domestically outsource” them to other companies, replacing their American workers. They do so by bypassing a rule prohibiting the hiring of a foreign worker if it directly led to the firing of an American worker. Outsourcing through a third-party system is critical to the business model of Indian IT services companies.The officials did not name any Indian companies, but did mention two American companies that have gone on to become controversial face of this practice, Disney and AT&T. Most egregiously for the critics of this practice, Americans workers were forced to train the foreign workers who replaced them.“The President has instructed us to end that practice and will do so by regulation as soon as we possibly can,” said one of the officials who briefed reporters.The H-1B reforms will also include a change in the way the department of labour calculated prevailing wages so that foreign workers are in the upper end of the salary scale and don’t end up undercutting American workers. The labour department will also be empowered to investigate H-1B abuse.“Without regulatory language on changing the H-1B lottery to a system based on highest salary it is not possible to know whether such a regulation would be lawful and not struck down by a court,” said Stuart Andersen, whose non-partisan think tank National Foundation for American Policy closely tracks immigration issues, of the proposed changes in the H-1B selection system.The text or the timing of the regulation is not known.About the suspension of H-1B and other work visa, Andersen said, “it will encourage companies to conduct more work outside the United States and are much more likely to harm the US economic recovery than to aid it”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-to-sign-order-to-suspend-and-partly-overhaul-h-1b-visa/story-FmGEP5QPAjMU3SvQ8dVhsK.html
