They were released without bail.The officers had been suspended without pay Friday after a TV crew captured the confrontation the night before near the end of protests.The footage shows a man identified as Martin Gugino approaching a line of helmeted officers holding batons as they clear demonstrators from Niagara Square around the time of an 8 p.m. curfew.Two officers push Gugino backward, and he hits his head on the pavement. Blood spills as officers walk past. One officer leans down to check on the injured man before another officer urges the colleague to keep walking.Dozens of police officers stepped down from the department’s crowd control unit Friday, in response to their fellow officers’ suspensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-buffalo-police-officers-charged-with-assault-for-shoving-75-yr-old-protestor/story-MLgVNqeUzP6RbepzslqdzM.html
06-06-2020||World||Donald Trump’s week to be remembered as his undoing or his revival||Donald Trump endured one of the grimmest weeks of his presidency, as days of protests in U.S. cities emerged as the biggest test yet of his ability to lead in a crisis and put new strains on his argument for a second term.Yet, for Trump it was also a week that ended on a high note. An unexpected surge in May hiring, despite the coronavirus pandemic, and an easing of tensions on American streets allowed him to claim Friday, in an extemporaneous Rose Garden speech, that “it’s the greatest comeback in American history.”That optimism underscored why the first week of June will likely be remembered as an inflection point in Trump’s presidency one way or another, seared into the minds and votes of an ailing American population. In five days, Trump either solidified perceptions that he’s an authoritarian leader with little capacity to unify a broken nation -- or re-established himself as an able shepherd of the U.S. economy, regardless of how voters otherwise feel about him.For many voters, one good jobs report can’t erase the first half of a year that saw Trump’s approval rating plunge to nearly its lowest point ever after his widely panned handling of the coronavirus outbreak. His hostile attitude toward nationwide protests over police brutality has alienated many Americans, and even some Republicans and military leaders.Mattis to MurkowskiTrump’s former defense secretary, James Mattis, issued a scathing criticism of the president on Wednesday that was subsequently endorsed by Trump’s former chief of staff and another retired general, John Kelly, and by Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski.In the last month, the political battlefield has dramatically shifted under Trump’s feet, as polling showed his presumptive re-election opponent Joe Biden taking leads or coming within striking distance in states the president’s team didn’t expect to be competitive.The former vice president holds an eight-point lead in the RealClearPolitics average of national polls, and is leading by three points or more in the three Rust Belt states that gave Trump the White House -- Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Michigan -- and by smaller margins in Florida, Arizona, Ohio and North Carolina.Bad to WorseOne person familiar with the Trump campaign’s thinking said things had gone from bad to worse with the protests over George Floyd, a black man who died in Minneapolis police custody, and described alarm that the president’s previously impenetrable base of support appeared to be eroding.The person, who asked not to be identified discussing non-public information, described internal polling that shows increasing disapproval of the president and key states like Arizona slipping from Trump’s reach in the election.And while Friday’s jobs report shocked economists by showing a 2.5 million gain in employment, in contrast with forecasts of 7.5 million more lost jobs, there were warning signs in the data.Unemployment for African Americans, a demographic Trump has loudly courted, ticked up to 16.8%. And the Labor Department warned that the data contained an important inaccuracy. Many people surveyed who were on furloughs incorrectly reported their job status, artificially improving the unemployment rate.Biden meanwhile tried to seize on Trump’s difficulties. He delivered a well received speech on race relations in Philadelphia on Tuesday and brought in $4 million from just 25 wealthy donors in a virtual fundraiser on Thursday. He criticized Trump on Friday for “basically hanging a ‘mission accomplished’ banner when there is so much work to be done” during the president’s remarks on the jobs report.200 TweetsDespite a full schedule on Friday that saw him travel to Maine after his remarks on the economy, Trump issued 200 tweets, an all-time record for a single day, according to factba.se, a site that compiles his public remarks.The posts included items about the jobs report and about favorite targets including the Russian investigation, Biden and former President Barack Obama, Washington Mayor Muriel Bowser, whom he termed “grossly incompetent,” and former FBI attorney Lisa Page. Trump retweeted GOP lawmakers critizing Democrats over this week’s massive protests, slammed Twitter for taking down a campaign video over a copyright dispute, and promoted at least two books.Trump’s troubles began on Monday morning when he told the nation’s governors in a conference call that “most of you are weak” and warned they’d look like “jerks” if they didn’t “dominate” people protesting Floyd’s death.Recordings of the call were promptly leaked to news organizations.Whisked to BunkerThat evening, after criticism that he hadn’t addressed the nation on the unrest and reports the Secret Service had whisked him to a bunker to protect him from demonstrations in Washington, Trump decided to make impromptu remarks to reporters.As he threatened in the Rose Garden to use “thousands and thousands” of troops and law enforcement officers to quash violence and looting, reporters could hear authorities using munitions to clear peaceful protesters from Lafayette Square, across the street from the White House.Trump then gathered a coterie of all-white staff and walked across the emptied park to St. John’s Episcopal Church, which had been damaged by arson the night before, where he posed for photos holding up a Bible in one hand.“Pretty great,” he told reporters.The moment would define his week. Episcopal and Catholic leaders, former top military brass and even some Republicans condemned the violent dispersal of protesters before his walk to the church, and pictures of demonstrators fleeing police bearing plastic shields amid clouds of riot-control agents would become the indelible image from the event, instead of Trump’s photo op at the church.A night of bedlam in the streets of Washington, with low-flying military helicopters used to disperse protesters and drones hovering in the skies, deepened anxiety and outrage. By Tuesday afternoon, the government had begun transporting federal prison guards from out of state to reinforce the Secret Service and defend an expanding perimeter around the White House from protesters.Two Republican senators -- Tim Scott of South Carolina and Ben Sasse of Nebraska -- said they did not support the tactics used by federal authorities to disperse the Lafayette Square protesters. A presidential trip to the Catholic shrine to Saint John Paul II -- ostensibly to promote a religious freedom executive order -- only brought more embarrassment for the White House.The Catholic archbishop of Washington said it was “reprehensible” for the shrine to host the president after the Lafayette Square incident, while demonstrators with raised middle fingers and protest signs lined the motorcade route through the city.Pentagon CriticismThe political headwinds intensified for Trump on Wednesday, when Defense Secretary Mark Esper told reporters at the Pentagon he did not believe active-duty military troops should be used to address domestic turmoil. The remarks prompted consternation within the White House, and Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany offered only that “as of right now, Secretary Esper is still Secretary Esper” when asked if Trump retained confidence in his Pentagon chief.That afternoon came a broadside: Mattis, who had largely remained quiet since resigning from the administration in December 2018 in protest of Trump’s decision to withdraw from Syria, released a statement condemning Trump’s “bizarre photo op” at the church and the military leadership that enabled it.“Donald Trump is the first president in my lifetime who does not try to unite the American people -- does not even pretend to try,” Mattis said.Trump responded on Twitter, blasting his former Pentagon chief as “the world’s most overrated General” and saying he was happy to have fired him.On Friday, Kelly piled on. The former chief of staff sided with Mattis in a virtual event with Anthony Scaramucci, the financier who briefly served as Trump’s communications director but has since turned on him.“We need to look harder at who we elect,” said Kelly, who left the White House in January 2019. “We should look at people that are running for office and put them through the filter: What is their character like? What are their ethics?”In Maine on Friday, after touring a plant making swabs for coronavirus tests, Trump had a reply: he’s bringing back jobs. He noted that the 2.5 million jobs added in May was the most ever, overlooking that the 20.5 million lost in April was also a record.“The only thing that can screw it up,” he said, “is if you get the wrong president.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-s-week-to-be-remembered-as-his-undoing-or-his-revival/story-8pl48BUMnpqIXX8iGIQoeL.html

Banksy, whose identity remains unknown but has gained world-wide acclaim for his work appearing on public buildings, commented on the ‘Black Lives Matter’ movement in a social media post accompanied by artwork featuring a burning US flag.He wrote: “At first I thought I should just shut up and listen to black people about this issue. ‘But why would I do that? It’s not their problem, it’s mine.’ People of colour are being failed by the system. The white system”.Also read | ‘A great day for George Floyd,’ says Trump as he hails strong jobs report for US“Like a broken pipe flooding the apartment of the people living downstairs. The faulty system is making their life a misery, but it’s not their job to fix it. They can’t - no-one will let them in the apartment upstairs.”In Parliament Square in London and elsewhere, tens of thousands of people ignored official advice to avoid mass gatherings and came together to protest against the killing, carrying placards and ‘taking the knee’; not everyone wore face-masks.Patel said: “Of course, I completely understand people’s desire to express their views and to have that right to protest. But the fact of the matter is we are in a health pandemic across the United Kingdom and coronavirus is a deadly virus”. A post shared by Banksy (@banksy) on Jun 6, 2020 at 3:30am PDT“I’d say to those that want to protest: please don’t. The regulations are very clear in terms of gatherings and mass gatherings in particular. We must put public health first at this particular time”, she added.Cressida Dick, Scotland Yard commissioner, told police officers not to ‘take the knee’ as an act of solidarity, and advised people to protest without gathering in large groups because of the pandemic.She said: “We encourage our officers to talk to people, to engage in a positive manner with people. We won’t be kneeling during protests. However heartfelt something like that might be, I don’t think it is likely to be safe”.“We are fighting a deadly virus, it can get spread in gatherings,” she added.Also read | George Floyd’s death sparks new generation of activists in US||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-banksy-joins-tens-of-thousands-in-uk-protests/story-d6amDIHBf3xsscuAAd3KgK.html

All three politicians have denied the charges, and in two instances have filed a complaint with the country’s law enforcement agencies to investigate the matter further. This is the latest controversy involving Cynthia Ritchie, a combative social media influencer whom most outside of Pakistan would never heard of. Ritchie posted a Facebook live video on Friday in which she named former interior minister Rahman Malik, currently a member of the Senate or upper house of Parliament, of sexually assaulting her. She also accused former premier Yousaf Raza Gilani and former health minister Makhdoom Shahabuddin of harassing her. All three politicians belong to the opposition Pakistan People’s Party (PPP). This Facebook video was the latest in a series of exchanges between Ritchie and the leadership of the PPP, which has been incensed by the barrage of accusations flung their way by the American.Also Watch | ‘They want riots...’: PoK activist on Pakistan bid to hold Gilgit Baltistan polls Ritchie started the current spat by accusing late prime minister Benazir Bhutto of having ordered the rape of those women she suspected were having relations with her husband, Asif Ali Zardari. As on many occasions in the past, Ritchie offered no evidence to substantiate her allegations that have been described by several commentators as bizarre.While Zardari did not react to the accusation, the PPP’s senior leadership responded by asking who Ritchie was, who had authorised her stay in Pakistan, and what her source of income was, given that she did not seem to be engaged in any work with remuneration.Details were leaked from both sides - the PPP accused Ritchie of being a troll funded by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency while Ritchie questioned the actions of PPP leaders. In one bizarre gaffe, Ritchie posted a picture of Murtaza Wahab, a provincial minister from the PPP, standing next to a scantily dressed woman and accused him of being immoral. Wahab clarified the woman in question was a wax model at Madame Tussauds in London.Ritchie has accused PPP leaders of links with Gulf-based businessmen and alleged they were involved in a number of scams – all without any evidence whatsoever. So far the Pakistan Tehrik-e-Insaf (PTI) government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan, which is perceived as being close to the army, has taken no action despite a number of complaints filed against Ritchie with the cybercrime wing of the Federal Investigation Agency.In her latest accusation, Ritchie said her “ordeal” took place at Rehman Malik’s official residence in the ministers’ enclave in Islamabad in 2011 around the time “when the Osama Bin Laden incident happened”.“I thought it was a meeting about my visa but I was given flowers [and] a drugged drink,” she claimed, adding she had “kept quiet” about the incident because “who in the [ruling government] would help me against the [accused minister]?”Cynthia said she also informed the US embassy in 2011 about the incident, adding that “owing to fluid and complex Pak-US relations, the response was less than adequate”.In a tweet, exiled political commentator Aisha Siddiqa said the Pakistani establishment may be wanting to put pressure on the PPP leadership ahead of moves to roll back the 18th amendment to the Constitution. This amendment was passed by the former PPP government and gives enhanced powers to the democratic civilian government and to the provinces. Many commentators and experts in Pakistan also believe Ritchie – who has never shied away from flaunting her connections to the military on social media and often takes up nationalistic causes in her social media posts – could be acting at the behest of the powerful security establishment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-based-us-blogger-cynthia-ritchie-accuses-three-ppp-leaders-of-rape-assault/story-W5aiCiqYOTsk9K7JFvSEaP.html
06-06-2020||World||Pak-based American blogger accuses three PPP leaders of rape and assault||A Pakistan-based American blogger has accused three senior leaders of the opposition Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) of raping and assaulting her in 2011.Cynthia D Ritchie made the allegation through a video clip posted on her Facebook page on Friday and soon it went viral on social media.“In 2011, I was raped by the former interior minister Rehman Malik. That’s right, I’ll say it again. I was raped by the then interior minister Rehman Malik,” she claimed.She also said that former prime minister Yousuf Raza Gilani and former health minister Makhdoom Shahabuddin “physically manhandled” her while Gilani was staying at the “President’s House” in Islamabad.Ritchie’s allegations have escalated the already bitter row between her and the party after she posted a comment on a tweet on May 28 against slain PPP leader and former prime minister Benzair Bhutto, which was termed as derogatory by the party leaders who filed a complaint against her at the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA).Her comments came on a tweet discussing the violent confrontation between model Uzma Khan and a woman, who accused the former of having a relationship with her husband of 13 years and used this allegation to justify her violent treatment of the model.“This echoes stories of what BB used to do when her husband cheated. She’d have the guards rape the women. Why do women condone this rape culture? Why aren’t the men ever held accountable? Where is the justice system?” Ritchie wrote the comment on the tweet.According to media reports, PPP, on the same day, filed a complaint with the FIA against Ritchie for “hateful comments and slander” against Bhutto.In another post, Ritchie said that the rape assault against her took place at Malik’s house in the Ministers’ Enclave around the time of the raid in which Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed in Pakistan in 2011.“I thought it (was) a meeting about my visa but I was given flowers/a drugged drink,” she wrote.He also said that she kept mum as no one in the then PPP government helped her.PPP was in power from 2008 until 2013 and Gilani was the prime minister until he was removed by the Supreme Court in June 2012 for disobeying court orders.Ritchie also said she had informed about the incident to “someone” at the US Embassy in Pakistan in 2011, “but due to ‘fluid’ situation and ‘complex’ relations between US and Pakistan, [the] response was less than adequate”.Referring to her ongoing battle with the PPP, she said it was not really about that tweet but about the individuals who know she had a lot of dirt on a lot of people in Pakistan. “It is primarily those who use and abuse others, particularly women and the vulnerable population. And I am one of them,” Ritchie was quoted as saying by Dawn newspaper.However, Gilani has denied the charges and said that he is even considering responding to such allegations, “humiliation and disgrace”.While talking to ARY News, he was asked what Richie was doing at the Presidency when she was allegedly manhandled, and why she had been staying in Pakistan.Gilani alleged that she had come to Pakistan as part of a campaign to malign politicians.“Who has given them the right to malign politicians?” he asked.He said Ritchie was maligning him because his two sons had filed a defamation case against her for her allegedly defamatory tweet against Bhutto.However, the two former ministers have not so far responded to the allegations.

06-06-2020||World||Singapore opposition leader Pritam Singh calls for review of Covid-19 response||Singapore’s largest opposition party called for a thorough review of the government’s coronavirus response, citing public confusion over unclear communication and actions.“There is the perception that the government’s handling of the Covid-19 crisis has certainly not included adjectives that are more commonly associated with the Singapore government, such as clarity and decisiveness,” Workers’ Party chief Pritam Singh said in a speech to parliament on Friday. He said citizens have the right to expect a “thorough review and accounting” of the government’s response.This is first time the party has commented on how the government has handled the crisis overall, though it recently called for more clarity on how campaigning rules would be modified in view of the pandemic. The People’s Action Party has held power since Singapore’s independence in 1965 and is widely expected to win an election that must be held by early next year. Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, the son of founding premier Lee Kuan Yew, has signaled he intends to step aside by the time he turns 70 in 2022.In the administration’s handling of the virus outbreak, Singh said the public seemed to be confused by “many piecemeal announcements, U-turns and positions that didn’t gel intuitively,” such as limiting visits to relatives even after safe-distancing rules on public transport were lifted.The opposition leader took exception with the government’s resistance to requisitioning mask supplies as other nations had done, “probably with an eye on the future so that international companies would always see Singapore as a reliable place to do business.”Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said in parliament on Friday that the government consulted a wide range of people to decide on its response. The government so far has announced S$93 billion ($67 billion) of stimulus, of which Heng said 80% is committed to helping supporting businesses and workers in the city-state, where unemployment is expected to rise to a record of more than 100,000 this year.In a separate speech to the legislature Friday, Workers’ Party member Leon Perera criticized the administration’s “technocratic zeal” in issuing too many rules that were often qualified or changed after being announced. He suggested the government should consider leaving the choice to business owners on how they would like to resume operations while still adhering to safe distancing rules.“We need to find the right balance between protecting livelihoods and protecting lives,” Perera said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-opposition-leader-pritam-singh-calls-for-review-of-covid-19-response/story-MePKekgm7QGpbxDbxf0QzI.html

Video footage posted on social media showed a boy escaping from the blazing car with burns on parts of his body and begging for water. The ministry said the video was genuine and Afghans in Iran were trying to identify the victims.The boy’s plea of “give me some water, I am burning” was widely circulated on social media and taken up by rights group demanding justice.“Iran has no right to kill Afghan refugees, they can seal their borders, expel all Afghans but not kill them,” said Ali Noori, a lawyer and rights activist said on Facebook.Afghans have for decades sought refuge in Iran from war and poverty in their homeland.Iran says about 2.5 million Afghan migrants, both legal and undocumented, live there. Facing its own economic problems worsened by international sanctions, Iran has at times tried to send Afghans home.Last month, Afghan officials said Iranian border guards killed 45 Afghan migrant workers by forcing them at gunpoint into a mountain torrent on the border.At the time, Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi issued a statement saying only that the incident in question had taken place on Afghan soil.Iranian embassy officials in Afghan capital, Kabul were not immediately available for comment on the latest incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghans-condemn-iranian-police-after-refugees-killed-in-car-blaze/story-I1MoPXTiOAFSuhu5loAt9H.html
06-06-2020||World||Multi-pronged approach on line as drug-makers race to develop Covid-19 vaccine: Top updates||Coronavirus cases across the globe are inching toward a grim milestone. Globally, the number of Covid-19 infections will soon touch the 7 million-mark. What started with a few hundred cases in the Chinese city of Wuhan last December, went on to take the shape of a pandemic, sparing no corners of the world. With the rapid rise in the number of infections, the imminent need to arrive at a vaccine for coronavirus grows more urgent. A report published in the medical journal the Lancet describes vaccine development as “typically a long game”. “The US Food and Drug Administration only approved the first vaccine against Ebola virus last year,” it states. However, pharmaceutical and drug-making companies across the world are leaving no stone unturned to arrive at the Covid-19 vaccine. Ten vaccines against Covid-19 are in the clinical trials phase. Researchers at the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca hope to have the first phase 3 data in hand this summer. “Although many infectious disease experts argue that even 18 months for a first vaccine is an incredibly aggressive schedule, a few optimists believe that hundreds of millions of doses of vaccine might be ready for roll-out by the end of 2020,” the Lancet report states. Here are the latest developments:• Moderna’s mRNA-1273, which entered into clinical trials just 66 days after SARS-CoV-2 was first sequenced, showcases the potential for nucleotide-based vaccines, the Lancet report states. • “The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca have embraced a recombinant vaccine called AZD1222 to achieve a similar effect, engineering a chimpanzee adenovirus to carry DNA for the spike antigen,” the report read.• Other candidates like Sanofi and GlaxoSmithKline are working together on a protein subunit approach. The two companies hope to start a phase 1 trial later this year.Also read: 9,887 Covid-19 cases in India in 24 hours, 294 deaths in highest single-day jump• Biopharma major AstraZeneca has entered into an agreement with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), among other world-wide vaccine manufacturers, to produce the vaccine currently under trial at the University of Oxford on a mass scale, if successful.• AstraZeneca cancer drug shows promising results in the fight against Covid-19, Bloomberg reported. The study was conducted on a small group of 19 people wherein experts found that a cancer drug from AstraZeneca could be repurposed to help Covid-19 patients experiencing extreme immune reactions.• Indian drugmaker Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd said on Friday it was testing a plant-derived drug, AQCH, for the potential treatment of Covid-19 as part of a mid-stage trial, with results expected by October.• Clinical trials of phytopharmaceutical ACQH began on Friday, said S Mande, director-general, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research. “We’re going to try it against Covid-19. It’s historic in modern medicine, especially in India. We’ve a chance to tap our traditional knowledge system and its limitless possibilities,” he said.

06-06-2020||World||UK halts trial of hydroxychloroquine as ‘useless’ for Covid-19 patients||British scientists halted a major drug trial on Friday after it found that the anti-malarial hydroxychloroquine, touted by US President Donald Trump as a potential “game changer” in the pandemic, was “useless” at treating COVID-19 patients. “This is not a treatment for Covid-19. It doesn’t work,” Martin Landray, an Oxford University professor who is co-leading the RECOVERY trial, told reporters.“This result should change medical practice worldwide. We can now stop using a drug that is useless.”Vocal support from Trump raised expectations for the decades-old drug that experts said could have been a cheap and widely available tool, if proven to work, in fighting the pandemic, which has infected more than 6.4 million people and killed nearly 400,000 worldwideControversy surrounding the drug grew after a study published in medical journal The Lancet last month raised safety concerns and led several Covid-19 studies of it to be halted. The Lancet study was then retracted on Thursday after its authors said they were unsure about its data.Landray, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Oxford University, noted the “huge speculation” about the drug as a treatment for Covid-19 but said there had been until now “an absence of reliable information from large randomised trials”.He said the preliminary results from RECOVERY, which was a randomised trial, were now quite clear: hydroxychloroquine does not reduce the risk of death among hospitalised patients with Covid-19.“If you’re admitted to hospital, don’t take hydroxychloroquine,” he said.The RECOVERY trial of hydroxychloroquine had randomly assigned 1,542 Covid-19 patients to hydroxychloroquine and compared them with 3,132 Covid-19 patients randomly assigned to standard care without the drug.Results showed no significant difference in death rates after 28 days, in length of stay in hospital or in other outcomes, the researchers said.The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday it would resume tests of hydroxychloroquine as part of its ‘Solidarity’ trials, after those running the study briefly stopped giving it to new patients in light of the Lancet paper.Peter Horby, an Oxford University professor who is co-leading the RECOVERY trial with Landray, said his team had informed the WHO of their decision to halt the UK study.“There was a call this morning with the WHO to give them a heads-up on the results... They... said they would be convening their committee to look again at their decision regarding the Solidarity trial.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-halts-trial-of-hydroxychloroquine-as-useless-for-covid-19-patients/story-unzopJyzvxyOMideSzCTsM.html
06-06-2020||World||Pak court issues notice to Imran Khan in Shahbaz’s defamation case||A Pakistani court has issued a notice to Prime Minister Imran Khan in a defamation case filed by PML-N president Shahbaz Sharif seeking early hearing of his suit against the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairman, pending for three years.Prime Minister Khan in April 2017 alleged that Shahbaz offered him USD 61 million through a “common friend” to withdraw the Panama Papers case in the Supreme Court against 70-year-old former prime minister and his elder brother Nawaz Sharif. Sharif, who is currently in London for treatment, is the supremo of the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N). He was disqualified as prime minister in 2017 by the Supreme Court in 2017 in the Panama Papers case.Three corruption cases - Avenfield properties, Flagship investment and Al-Azizia steel mills - were registered against the Sharif family by the anti-graft body in 2017 following a judgment by the Supreme Court that disqualified him.However, Khan did not name the person who offered him USD 61 million on behalf of the Leader of Opposition in the National Assembly Shahbaz.Lahore’s Additional District and Sessions Court on Friday took up Shahbaz’s application for early hearing on June 10 in which he pleaded that (Prime Minister) Khan failed to file a written reply for the last three years causing no substantial proceedings in the case.“In total 60 hearings in this case, Khan’s lawyer sought adjournment on 33 occasions. In the last hearing, the court was told that lead counsel advisor to Khan, Babar Awan could not travel from Islamabad to Lahore due to COVID-19 and the court adjourned hearing for June 22,” a counsel for Shahbaz told the court.Under the law, he said Awan cannot appear before the court to defend PM Khan since he has become his advisor.In his petition, Shahbaz requested the court to issue a decree for recovery of USD 61 million as compensation for the publication of defamatory content in his favour for causing great damage to his reputation in the public.After hearing the arguments, Additional District & Sessions Judge Sohail Anjum issued notice to Prime Minister Khan for June 10 to submit a written reply.Talking to the media after the court issued notice to Prime Minister Khan, PML-N spokesperson Marriyum Auranzeb said: “Imran will no longer qualify on Article 62, 63 of the Constitution if he fails to submit a response in the Rs10bn defamation case. I challenge Imran Khan to answer in court over his allegation of Rs10bn hush money offered by Shehbaz Sharif to him.” She said if on Jun 10 Imran fails to submit an answer in the court he will be “officially stamped” as a “liar” and will no longer be morally eligible to hold the office of a member of the National Assembly and the Prime Minister of Pakistan.“Does a liar, incompetent and unqualified person deserve to be the leader of the Pakistani nation,” she asked.Auranzeb further said Imran has been an absconder in this case for the past three years, and has delayed proceedings 33 times. “Similarly, for the last six years he had been an absconder from the foreign funding case and for the past two years over the 23 secret accounts case,” she lamented.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-court-issues-notice-to-imran-khan-in-shahbaz-s-defamation-case/story-ciL3NCDnJsV2yPERLT7JIP.html
06-06-2020||World||Minneapolis, California move to end police neck restraints||The Minneapolis City Council on Friday voted to end use of chokeholds and neck restraints like that used by a white police officer who pressed his knee into the neck of unarmed black man George Floyd on May 25, sparking coast-to-coast protests.In California, Governor Gavin Newsom said he would end state police training in carotid restraints similar to the technique used on Floyd by former Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin while three officers stood by and watched as Floyd died after pleading for his life. The Minneapolis police fired all four officers, and they have been charged with murder. The incident has communities across the United States reconsidering use of such restraints.The Minneapolis decision came in response to a Minnesota state human rights complaint against the city. In a proposed court order that must be approved by a judge, the Minneapolis City Council said it would ban all chokeholds and neck holds, and require any member of the police department to immediately report any unauthorized use of force by an officer.“Black, Indigenous, and communities of color have suffered generational pain and trauma as a result of systemic and institutional racism and long-standing problems in policing,” said the proposed order which the council approved unanimously.San Diego County in California this week also banned the carotid restraint, in which an officer blocks the flow of blood to a detainee’s brain, leading to unconsciousness.Newsom said he supports legislation to ban use of the technique in local police departments throughout California.“At the end of the day the carotid hold is literally designed to stop people’s blood from flowing into their brain,” Newsom said. “That has no place any longer.”Many police departments have ended the use of so-called chokeholds, which put pressure on a detainee’s windpipe, but have still allowed carotid restraints.

06-06-2020||World||Trump ‘promises’ India, China will find more Covid-19 cases with more tests||US President Donald Trump has said that countries like India and China would have much more coronavirus cases than America if they conduct more tests.Trump, in his remarks at Puritan Medical Products in Maine, said that the US has carried out 20 million tests.Compared to the US, Germany is at four million and much talked about South Korea is about three million tests, he said on Friday.According to Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center, the US has reported nearly 1.9 million cases and over 1,09,000 deaths while the total number of coronavirus cases in India and China stand at 2,36,184 and 84,177 respectively.India has so far conducted over 4 million coronavirus tests, according to the health ministry.Commenting on the Covid-19 tests in the US, Trump said: “We will be well over 20 million tests. Remember this, when you test more, you have more cases.“I say to my people every time we test; you find cases because we do more testing. If we have more cases, if we wanted to do testing in China or in India or other places, I promise you there would be more cases… you are doing a fantastic job in getting out the swabs”.Puritan is one of the only manufacturers in the world producing the high-quality medical swabs that are crucial for rapid testing.“And every swab you make at Puritan is proudly stamped with the beautiful phrase made in the USA.“Thanks to the testing capacity that you are making possible, our country is reopening and our economy is recovering like nobody would’ve thought possible,” he said.Referring to the latest monthly employment numbers, Trump said that the economy is now back on track.“We absolutely shattered expectations, and this is the largest monthly jobs increase in American history, think of that; that’s a long time.“I think it’s more than double or about double of what our highest was before so this is the largest monthly job increase in American history. And we’re going to have a phenomenal next year. We’re going to have a tremendous couple of months prior to the election on November 3 very, very important date,” the president said.Seeking re-election for his second consecutive term, Trump is pitted against Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden in November 3 presidential elections. Most of the opinion polls shows that Biden is several points ahead of Trump.“It’s going to be a very important election because the only thing that can screw it up is if you get the wrong president and they raise your taxes, and they open up your borders so that everybody pours into our country,” Trump said.Reiterating that he has built a strong economy in the last three years, Trump vowed to bring the economy back on track, which has been badly hit by the coronavirus pandemic.Describing the fight against coronavirus as the greatest national and industrial mobilisation since the World War II, Trump said that his administration has marshaled the full power of the US government and US industry to defeat the invisible enemy.“It is indeed an enemy. It came from China, should have been stopped in China. They didn’t do that,” he alleged.The administration, he said, has delivered over 1.5 billion pieces of personal protective equipment to doctors and nurses on the front lines. “We slashed the red tape to speed up the development of vaccines. And vaccines are coming along incredibly well, wait till you see, and therapeutics. And we partnered at private sector leaders such as Puritan to build the largest and most advanced testing capacity on the face of the earth, like this one,” he said.The Puritan factory in Maine, he said, quickly ramped up the production to produce nearly 20 million foam tipped swabs each month.“Then in April, my administration invoked the Defence Production Act to help you scale up even more. Under a USD 75 million public-private partnership, Puritan will soon double production to 40 million swabs per month,” Trump added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-promises-india-china-will-find-more-covid-19-cases-with-more-tests/story-ISgpS3x559YC4eq5msahsL.html
06-06-2020||World||Who are Antifa, the ‘boogaloo’ movement and others blamed in US protest violence?||President Donald Trump and his allies have sought to blame left-wing extremists for the violence and looting at US protests over police brutality while local authorities and watchdog groups have pointed to the threat posed by right-wing movements.A recent US intelligence assessment reviewed by Reuters this week said most of the violence at protests appears to have been driven by opportunists. But the assessment also said there was some evidence that organized extremists were tied to violence or promoting it online.WHICH GROUPS ARE BEING SINGLED OUT?President Donald Trump and some fellow Republicans have sought to blame the left-wing anti-fascist Antifa movement but have presented little evidence.Liberal watchdog groups and some local authorities have warned that members of the anti-government “boogaloo” movement or white supremacist groups could infiltrate protests.Federal prosecutors filed charges this week against three alleged boogaloo members accused of plotting to cause violence and destruction at Las Vegas protest.WHAT IS ANTIFA?Antifa, short for “anti-fascist,” is an amorphous movement whose adherents oppose people or groups they consider authoritarian or racist, according to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which monitors extremists. Antifa aims to “intimidate and dissuade racists,” but its aggressive tactics including physical confrontations can create “a vicious, self-defeating cycle of attacks, counter-attacks and blame,” the ADL said.The FBI has been increasingly concerned about violence perpetrated by Antifa at public events, according to a 2018 report by the Congressional Research Service, a public policy research arm of the US Congress.WHY IS ANTIFA SO WELL-KNOWN?Antifa grew in notoriety following a 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, organized by white supremacists and white nationalists who clashed violently with counter-protesters. Trump drew criticism afterward when he said there were “very fine people on both sides” and blamed “many sides” for the violence. Trump specifically mentioned Antifa.“You know, they show up in the helmets and the black masks, and they’ve got clubs and they’ve got everything,” Trump said of Antifa days after the rally.Mark Bray, author of “Antifa: The Anti-Fascist Handbook,” said Trump was focusing on Antifa to redirect the conversation away from social and economic discontent in the United States at the heart of the protests. “There just aren’t enough members of Antifa groups out there to do everything they’re being blamed for,” said Bray, a lecturer in history at Rutgers University in New Jersey.WHAT IS THE BOOGALOO MOVEMENT?The anti-government boogaloo movement embodies a militant ideology whose members believe the United States will enter into a second civil war, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups. Boogaloo followers anticipate the government will attempt to confiscate people’s guns.The boogaloo ideology itself is not white supremacist, but some white supremacist groups have embraced it, the ADL found.“Whereas the militia movement (and) radical gun rights activists typically promote the boogaloo as a war against the government or liberals, white supremacists conceive of the boogaloo as a race war or a white revolution,” the ADL wrote in a November analysis.Boogaloo groups have grown in popularity online in the past year. The Tech Transparency Project, a Washington-based tech watchdog group, found tens of thousands of people joined boogaloo-related Facebook groups over a 30-day period in March and April as stay-at-home orders took effect across the United States to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. Project researchers found discussions about tactical strategies, weapons and creating explosives in some boogaloo Facebook groups. WHAT ABOUT WHITE SUPREMACISTS AND WHITE NATIONALISTS?A small number of white supremacists and white nationalists have been spotted at recent protests, according to watchdog groups and media reports. The Nationalist Social Club, a neo-Nazi group, appeared to have had some presence at protests in Boston and Knoxville, Tennessee, the ADL said. Members of the far-right Proud Boys were seen at North Carolina and Oregon protests last weekend, according to media reports.Nate Snyder, a former US Department of Homeland Security counter-terrorism official, said it is likely anarchists were among the protesters in recent days, but doubted they would pose a credible violent threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-are-antifa-the-boogaloo-movement-and-others-blamed-in-us-protest-violence/story-udOQzAsl7aO1wg05ba3BqM.html

He was 87.His family said Yokota died of natural causes in a hospital in Kawasaki, near Tokyo, on Friday, before he was able to meet his daughter again.“My husband and I did our best together, but he passed before seeing Megumi again. Now I’m at a loss,” his wife Sakie, 84, said in a statement.Megumi disappeared in 1977 on her way home from her a junior high school in Niigata on Japan’s northern coast when she was 13. It was the day after she gave her father a comb as a birthday gift, a memento he always carried with him.Shigeru Yokota has died. He was 87. He was the father of Megumi Yokota, who was abducted by North Korea.We wonder how he was feeling as he waited to be reunited with his daughter. Please, please rest in peace. I am sad. pic.twitter.com/ngKgCwKdbjA former Central Bank official, Yokota, and his wife kept looking for Megumi and found out 20 years later that she had been abducted to North Korea by its agents.In 1997, Yokota founded a group with other abduction victims’ families and headed it for a decade. The smiling and soft-spoken Yokota became the face of the campaign that eventually gained government backing.The Yokotas had traveled around Japan carrying their daughter’s photos. An image of an innocent-looking teenager in a school uniform became a rallying cry for their cause.After years of denial, North Korea in 2002 acknowledged abducting 13 Japanese. Japan maintains that the North abducted at least 17 people to train agents in Japanese language and culture to spy on rival South Korea.Five of the abductees were allowed to return home for a visit later that year and have since stayed. North Korea says eight others, including Megumi, had died and denies that the other four entered its territory. Their families and the Japanese government disagree.North Korea sent samples of what it said were Megumi’s ashes but DNA examination by the Japanese government showed they were not hers and were mixed with non-human remains.In 2014, the Yokotas traveled to Mongolia to meet a daughter Megumi gave birth to in North Korea, but Megumi was not there.Japan and North Korea have no diplomatic ties, and efforts to resolve the abductions have since largely stalled. Many elderly relatives say they’re running out of time to see their loved ones.Yokota stepped down as the group’s leader in 2007 due to declining health, though he continued to make public appearances though did not speak in public for the last four years.“I’m filled with regret and sadness that we haven’t been able to bring (Megumi) back,” Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters Friday. He renewed his pledge to bring the abductees home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/father-of-north-korea-abduction-victim-dies-without-meeting-his-daughter/story-omy75mmKJidyvNGY89WS6M.html
06-06-2020||World||French forces kill leader of Al-Qaeda in northern Mali: Report||French forces have killed the leader of Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, Algerian Abdelmalek Droukdel, in northern Mali, France’s defence minister said.Droukdel was killed on Thursday near the Algerian border, where the group has bases from which it has carried out attacks and abductions of Westerners in the sub-Saharan Sahel zone, Defence Minister Florence Parly said Friday.“Many close associates” of Droukdel -- who commanded several affiliate jihadist groups across the lawless region -- were also “neutralised”, she added.Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) emerged from a group started in the late 1990s by radical Algerian Islamists, who in 2007 pledged allegiance to Osama Bin Laden’s Al-Qaeda network.The group has claimed responsibility for a string of attacks on troops and civilians across the Sahel, including a 2016 attack on an upmarket hotel and restaurant in Burkina Faso, which killed 30 people, mainly Westerners.France has deployed more than 5,000 troops to combat jihadist groups in the region -- a largely lawless expanse stretching over Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania and Niger, where drugs and arms flow through porous borders.Northern Mali is the site of frequent clashes between rival armed groups, as well as a haven for jihadist activity.In 2012, key cities fell under the control of jihadist groups linked to Al-Qaeda, who exploited an ethnic Tuareg-led rebel uprising, leading to a French-led military intervention.According to the UN, Droukdel was an explosives expert and manufactured devices that killed hundreds of civilians in attacks on public places.He was sentenced to death in Algeria in 2013 for his involvement in the bombings of a government building and offices of the UN’s refugee committee in Algiers that killed 26 people and wounded 177.The US said it had provided intelligence to help track down Droukdel.“US Africa Command was able to assist with intelligence and... support to fix the target,” spokesman Colonel Chris Karns told CNN on Friday.Islamic State official captured France also claimed on Friday to have captured a leader of the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (EIGS) group, which carries out frequent attacks over Niger’s western borders.“On May 19, French forces captured Mohamed el Mrabat, veteran jihadist in the Sahel region and an important cadre in EIGS”, Parly said on Twitter.Operations against EIGS “the other great terrorist threat in the region” are continuing, said Parly.Mali is struggling to contain an Islamist insurgency that erupted in 2012 and has claimed thousands of military and civilian lives since.Despite the presence of thousands of French and UN troops, the conflict has engulfed the centre of the country and spread to neighbouring Burkina Faso and Niger.A source told AFP that some 500 jihadist fighters had been killed or captured by French troops in the region in recent months, among them several leading figures including commanders and recruiters.Droukdel’s death is a symbolic coup for the French, a military source said.He had remained a threat in the region, capable of financing jihadist movements, even though his leadership had been contested, the source added.His death, and that of other Al Qaeda figures, could leave the group disorganised in the Sahel.Born in 1971 in a poor neighbourhood of Algiers, Droukdel took part in the founding in Algeria of the Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat (GSPC).Abdelaziz Bouteflika, elected Algerian president in 1999, managed to convince most of the armed groups in the country to lay down their weapons.The GSPC, however, refused to do so and Droukdel decided to approach Al-Qaeda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-forces-kill-leader-of-al-qaeda-in-northern-mali-report/story-NeSJsIR1974oM97Hv8Z7yH.html

To date, G20 members and invited countries have pledged over US$21 billion to support funding in global health,” the group said in a statement.The pledges will be directed towards diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics, and research and development, the statement added.In April the group called on all countries, non-governmental organizations, philanthropies and the private sector to help close a financing gap estimated at over $8 billion to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.Saudi Arabia, the current G20 chair has pledged $500 million to support global efforts to combat the pandemic. It said then it would allocate $150 million to the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation, $150 million to the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisations, and $200 million to other health organisations and programmes.At least 391,108 people have died globally from COVID-19 and more than 6.68 million people have been infected by the novel coronavirus that causes it, following an outbreak that started in Wuhan, China, in early December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/g20-pledges-more-than-21-billion-to-fight-coronavirus/story-sGVn4JSGd5mpxHJvvCwM3O.html
06-06-2020||World||Rage against Spain PM Pedro Sanchez is tearing the nation apart||Spaniards are getting really worked up about Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez. At one point last month, the defaced image of the photogenic Socialist was plastered across a giant red banner hung in downtown Madrid.The trigger has been his widely-criticized handling of the coronavirus pandemic that has seen Spain suffer among the highest death tolls in Europe. But as the worst of the trauma starts to fade, the vitriol has only gotten worse. The opposition is stirring legitimate criticism with paranoia, crackpot conspiracy theories and ancient resentments into a toxic brew.The country is emerging from its three-month lockdown now. But the backlash in the capital is growing — one penthouse has been raining down anti-government leaflets on protesters gathered in the street below.The anger is palpable on social media feeds and in parliament, where 48-year-old Sanchez scraped together enough votes to extend his state-of-emergency powers this week with the furious opposition dredging up his coalition partner’s ties to Venezuela to paint the prime minister as a wannabe authoritarian.“We’re fighting for Spain,” said Jose Luis Marin as he led a few dozen pan-banging marchers through one of the capital’s swankiest neighborhoods. He was brandishing a 3-meter long Spanish flag with the word “Libertad” —  freedom — scrawled across it.In truth, tensions were always bubbling under the surface and the virus has simply turned up the temperature in Spain’s long-running culture wars. Broad swathes of the population questioned Sanchez’s legitimacy from the moment he took office.“I’m fascinated by the absolute hatred for Pedro Sanchez in certain parts of the right,” Roger Senserrich, a political scientist based in New Haven, Connecticut, observed on Twitter. “He’s a pretty normal politician, mediocre in almost everything, just as ambitious as any other leader of a national party and probably just as (in)competent. But my god, the hatred. It’s brutal.”A spokesman for the prime minister declined to comment.Spain is a young democracy that emerged from a military dictatorship in late 1970s to become one of Europe’s most thriving and socially liberal economies — and yet its politics remain fiercely partisan with sharp ideological fault lines reminiscent of the US under Donald Trump or Boris Johnson’s Brexit Britain.Sanchez is just as polarizing. That makes it almost impossible to imagine how its politicians will find common cause as it seeks a path out of a devastating recession.“The right always tends to be very personal in its attacks,” said Ignacio Urquizu, a sociologist and former Socialist lawmaker. “It focuses on the leader.”The images from the US over the past week show how quickly order can break down when you put together longstanding divisions, acute economic hardship and a burning sense of injustice. To be sure, Spain has seen nothing like the Black Lives Matter protests as yet, but it has some of the same ingredients. And a few of its own.For many of the conservative voters who make up about a third of the Spanish electorate, Sanchez’s original sin was to forge an alliance with the radical left group Podemos and the separatists of Catalonia and the Basque Country.Those groups came together in a 2018 no-confidence vote to oust the center-right People’s Party, which had been limping along since losing its majority three years earlier.Conservatives objected, with some justification, that Sanchez was lining up with lawmakers that wanted to undermine Spain’s constitutional order or, in the case of the Catalans, had actually tried to break up the country. They say his willingness to cut deals with those groups now to keep his minority coalition in power betrays his lack of scruples.“They’ve watched too many TV shows like Game of Thrones and House of Cards,” says PP official Javier Fernandez-Lasquetty, economy chief for the Madrid region. “That’s not how politics works in real life.”Parliamentary rules require any no-confidence motion to propose an alternative premier, so it’s highly unlikely the PP can force Sanchez out. All the same, at the start of the pandemic there was a moment of national unity. When Sanchez declared the state of emergency in March, not even the far-right group Vox voted against him.It didn’t last.Spain has been in the grip of a slow-motion constitutional crisis since 2015. Four general elections in that period have failed to produce even one stable executive, stirring up memories and grudges from the Civil War almost a century ago. The virus eventually made all that worse.With the PP controling Madrid, which has been at the epicenter of the outbreak, the tensions have been focused in the capital.When Sanchez started to lift restrictions in the rest of the country, Madrid and Barcelona were kept under lockdown and resentments started to build. Regional leaders said that the government’s criteria were neither transparent nor objective.“It was a pure show of force,” Lasquetty said in an interview. “Madrid felt mistreated. That explains what happened in May.”As relations unraveled, Madrid President Isabel Diaz Ayuso turned up an hour and a half late for one appointment with Sanchez and walked out of another. When the state of emergency expires on June 21, she will have much more control over the next phase of the capital’s reopening.Sanchez is losing his special powers at a moment when he’s struggling for control on various fronts.On top of the backlash on the streets, the prime minister has found himself embroiled in a fight with the Civil Guard, the country’s biggest police force. One of the force’s most senior officers was fired after it emerged that his officers had prepared a report critical of the government’s handling of the coronavirus, prompting cries of interference.Meanwhile protesters have been openly defying the terms of the lockdown. Those actions that have led to tens of thousands of fines in the rest of the country. But police in Madrid have on the whole turned a blind eye, perhaps wary of inflaming the situation.“If the economic situation gets worse, there is a chance that it may all expand beyond Madrid,” says Urquizu.The opposition is doing all it can to fan the flames and Pablo Iglesias, deputy prime minister and Podemos’s leader, is a lightning rod. The scruffy former academic, nicknamed derisively “the Ponytail” in reference to his trademark long hair, spent time in Caracas advising the Hugo Chavez government before setting up his party.When the 41-year-old first took his seat in parliament, he provocatively planted a kiss full on the mouth of a male colleague right in front of the conservative economy chief Luis de Guindos, to roars of approval from his party.In a heated debate in parliament last week, the PP’s main spokeswoman Cayetana Alvarez de Toledo dredged up Iglesias’s links to the left-wing government that has ravaged Venezuela for a generation. Alvarez de Toledo, an Oxford-educated aristocrat with an exotic-sounding Argentinian accent in Spanish, said the government is seeking to undermine independent state-institutions by appointing cronies and labeled Iglesias the son of a terrorist — a reference to his father’s activism during the dictatorship.“You have a plan, it’s true, it’s a plan against democracy,” Alvarez de Toledo, 45, said. “You want to create an authoritarian left-wing regime.”Those arguments mutate as they filter through the protests on the streets of the capital where angry, confused people are trying to process the events of the past few months.“They have done it badly on purpose,” said Carmen Corbera, at one protest, a Spanish flag stitched onto the side of her face mask and another pinned to her shoulders like a cape. “It was convenient for them to establish the communist regime that Pedro and Pablo want for Spain.”To be clear, there is zero evidence either that the pandemic was deliberately mishandled, or that the government is plotting to set up a communist regime.A Chavista takeover is not the real threat for Spain.The danger is that the country’s entrenched political factions are increasingly inhabiting parallel realities and leaving the country unable to face its mounting challenges. The lines at food banks are growing and in the weeks to come more and more people are likely to be sitting at home, out of work, and looking for someone to blame.Spain needs a prime minister to revive the battered economy, to stabilize the public finances and then get to work on the difficult process of fixing the democratic system.But like millions of his country’s people, Sanchez is just trying to get to the end of the month.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rage-against-spain-pm-pedro-sanchez-is-tearing-the-nation-apart/story-OrDfhowAHyNh50kZkhIkoN.html
06-06-2020||World||George Floyd’s death sparks new generation of activists in US||Kristina Knox, a 25-year-old child development teacher from Maryland, cried for days after watching video footage of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man in Minneapolis who died after a police officer kneeled on his neck while Floyd gasped for air.She had posted about high-profile episodes of police brutality wielded against black Americans on her social media accounts before she attended her first protest this week - spurred, in part, by hoping to create a better world for her two-year-old son.“I’m over being walked over, mentally, physically, emotionally,” Knox said at a protest outside the US Capitol. “Enough is enough.”Floyd’s death has sparked protests nationwide and around the world, engulfing city streets with thousands of demonstrators.Many of the demonstrators who milled around the US Capitol this week were black people in their twenties who, like Knox, had felt compelled after Floyd’s death to march on the streets for the first time.The US has been rocked by demonstrations over police killing of unarmed black men, women and boys over the past decade. During the most widespread protests, after the fatal shooting of teenager Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri in 2014, many of the protesters in Washington D.C. this week were just teens themselves.New demonstrators said they had been driven to protest after seeing too many videos and hearing too many stories about black Americans dying at the hands of police officers - and by their concerns about the future of the country itself.“It’s not to say that Ferguson did not anger us, but there’s definitely something different about this moment, especially because it is an election year,” said Arianna Evans, 23, a political science student, who attends Prince George’s Community College in Maryland.“We’re grappling with the soul of this country this year,” Evans said. If US President Donald Trump isn’t voted out of office, and a new generation doesn’t push for the reforms they want, “we may never see that chance.” The protests are broadly popular among Americans. According to a Reuters/Ipsos poll, 64% of American adults were sympathetic and 55% of Americans disapprove of the way Trump handled them.Trump, who is seeking re-election in November, has suggested to some governors to call in the National Guard.While it is not clear exactly how many people taking to the streets in protests over the past nine days are first-timers, organizers say the number of new protesters is significant.Freedom Fighters DC, a newly formed group that has hosted multiple demonstrations within Washington, said that about 150 were first-time protesters of the 500 or so protesters outside the Capitol building on Wednesday. Alayshia Florida, 20, a self-described first-time protester who is headed to nursing school this fall, convinced a white officer to kneel with her outside the US Capitol Wednesday, amid cheers. “It’s time we change how police officers view us by inviting them to see us as human beings,” she said. Asked what made this moment different, Kelsey Marshman, a 29-year-old mail handler, said: “It’s 2020! This should not be happening still. It really shouldn’t. I’m sick of there being video and these police (officers) not being held accountable for that.”The protesters’ demands include better police-sensitivity training, more serious background checks and convictions against the police officers involved in the case.Derek Chauvin, the police officer who pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck for nearly nine minutes, has been charged with second-degree murder. Minnesota sentencing guidelines suggest that someone convicted for second-degree murder without a criminal history receive between 22 and 30 years in prison. But Christa Groshek, a defense attorney in Minneapolis, said prosecutors would likely seek more than that if they secure a conviction against Chauvin.Minnesota also filed a civil rights charge against the Minneapolis Police Department over Floyd’s death and said it would investigate the department for systemic discriminatory practices.On the hot, sunny day in Washington on Wednesday, volunteers passed out water and hand sanitizer, in a bid to minimize risks from the coronavirus pandemic.Most protesters wore masks as they held up handmade signs bearing phrases like “Black Lives Matter,” “Stop Shooting” and “There comes a time when silence is betrayal.”“The people rose up against oppression in 2020. Were we successful stopping it? I doubt it,” said Lorenzo Bell, 36. “But did we just let them do it? ... No.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-s-death-sparks-new-generation-of-activists-in-us/story-oCWQuQHllIhYgedg8xPiVL.html
06-06-2020||World||China’s ‘salami-slicing tactics’ displays disregard for India’s efforts at peace||The current Sino-India border crisis has revealed that China has little respect for India’s long-standing efforts to freeze status quo along its frontiers, a top US observer on South Asia has claimed.Ashley Tellis, Tata Chair for Strategic Affairs and a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said that by its brazen actions, Beijing has forced New Delhi to join the rest of Asia in figuring out how to deal with the newest turn in China’s “salami-slicing tactics”.“The current Sino-Indian border crisis has revealed that China has little respect for India’s long-standing efforts to freeze the status quo along the two countries’ disputed frontiers or for New Delhi’s cautious efforts to avoid the appearance of balancing against Beijing,” he said.Rather, treating India’s internal actions regarding Jammu and Kashmir as a provocation, it has chosen to expand its control over new parts of the Himalayan borderlands through brazen actions that confront India with the difficult choice of either lumping its losses or escalating through force if the negotiations presently underway yield meager returns, Tellis wrote in his latest research paper.“By so doing, it has forced India to join the rest of Asia in figuring out how to deal with the newest turn in China’s salami-slicing tactics, which now distinctively mark its trajectory as a rising power,” he said. Unlike the discrete and geographically localised confrontations of the past, the latest encounters are occurring at multiple locations along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh in the eastern section of Jammu and Kashmir, which suggests a high degree of Chinese premeditation and approval for its military’s activities from the very top, Tellis claimed.“The unfortunate truth is that China, having exploited the initiative to seize pieces of India’s claimed territory, can now hold on to its new acquisitions forever unless India chooses to eject Chinese troops by force or decides to impose tit-for-tat costs on China by symmetrically occupying other pockets in disputed territory where it possesses a tactical advantage,” he said.This rejoinder admittedly carries risks because China could parry such Indian actions using its significant reserves already deployed at key locations along the front, in which case the stage would be set for perhaps a wider confrontation, he noted.Tellis said the pattern of Chinese patrolling since the late 1990s suggests that Beijing seeks to eventually control the entire the Aksai Chin plateau, on which parts of Ladakh are located.China has laid claim to this region since the 1950s, but as the Sino-Indian rivalry has increased after the Cold War, Beijing has attempted to gradually bring bits and pieces of the disputed frontier under its de facto authority, he said.The term de facto authority itself is inadequate in this context because, in the absence of maps that clearly delineate which areas each side actively controls, China’s creeping appropriation of territory cannot be either contested or contained except by physical Indian obstruction, Tellis noted.“On this count, Chinese actions have been singularly mischievous: although both countries have long committed to exchanging maps describing their presence in the disputed territories as the first step toward a boundary settlement, Beijing has thus far consistently declined to follow through on its obligations,” Tellis wrote in his paper.In large measures, this is because accepting any Indian map that marks an extant Indian presence would make it difficult for China to claim that territory in future negotiations. What China actually wants is the entirety of the disputed borderlands simply on the strength of its claim that it once possessed them, he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-s-salami-slicing-tactics-displays-disregard-for-india-s-efforts-at-peace/story-ujHFW5zcwTbKiP7j0QghGL.html

Mexico reported 625 newly confirmed Covid-19 deaths Friday, down from a peak of 1,092 on Wednesday and 816 on Thursday. The country now regularly adds more than 4,000 confirmed infections each day, and the cumulative case total stands at over 110,000, though officials acknowledge the real number is many times higher.In describing the investigation, Mexico City Mayor Claudia Sheinbaum alleged the doctors “were involved in charging for these services,” despite the fact that death certificates are supposed to be free but the process to obtain them can sometimes be lengthy and bureaucratic.“They sold these certificates when they should not have,” Sheinbaum said.The scheme purportedly involved at least one city government employee and around 10 doctors, none of whom were city hospital employees, the mayor said.There are also indications the doctors may have signed off causes of death other than Covid-19 for bodies they had never seen or examined, though the reasons were unclear, officials said.But bodies had been piling up at hospitals in Mexico City as the pandemic worsened, and some relatives may have simply wanted to get their deceased family members released more quickly. In addition, bodies of people who died from Covid-19 have to be cremated or buried under stricter rules so some families may have paid for a false certificate to avoid that or the social stigma the virus carries.No charges have been filed in the case.It would not be the first scandal in Mexico involving businesses that have grown up around the pandemic.In May, authorities found 3.5 tons of hospital waste illegally dumped in the woods on the outskirts of Mexico City. Officials also discovered 6,000 cubic yards (meters) of medical waste piled ceiling high at a warehouse in Puebla state.Teetering piles of discarded coffins, meanwhile, have piled up outside Mexico City’s overworked crematoriums. Specialized waste incinerators are over-taxed by the flood of disposed protective equipment and infectious tissue being generated amid the pandemic.Mexico is plagued by widespread problems with unregulated firms in both the waste disposal and funeral industries. According to the Senate, 60% of funeral agencies in Mexico are either unregistered or not fully registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-mexico-alleges-some-doctors-sold-false-death-certificates/story-HhVTf7wbq0aW466gnQDh0K.html

Australia is the most China-reliant economy in the developed world, leaving it vulnerable to diplomatic blowback.The warning comes after Australia announced a tough new screening regime on foreign investors seeking to buy sensitive assets as it bids to bolster national security. Telecommunications, energy, technology and defense-manufacturing companies will be included in the zero-dollar threshold for screening.The changes, intended to be legislated this year and enforced from Jan. 1, will include a new national security test and give the treasurer last-resort powers to force asset sales. Beijing responded with verbal attacks on the conservative government, saying it was doing the bidding of key ally the U.S.New tariffs on Australian barley and a ban on beef from four meatworks have raised fears in Canberra that the Chinese government is using “economic coercion” in retaliation.Before Australia’s calls for a probe into the origins of the coronavirus, its diplomatic ties with China were already under stress. The government cited Beijing’s “meddling” into national affairs as a catalyst for its anti-foreign interference laws passed in 2018, the same year it banned Huawei Technologies Co. from helping build its 5G network.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-issues-alert-warning-against-travel-to-australia-report/story-YM3KVC8UNz9X3as1rHx4BI.html

The official said the United States started working on the plan in September and had just now got the pieces in place.Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on Senate Armed Services Committee, said the move was “petty and preposterous.”Andrew Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace said the move was a “huge gift” for Russia. “With one fell swoop, Trump is showing once again that our alliances are nothing more than a political plaything,” Weiss said on Twitter. The White House said it had no announcements but Trump “continually reassesses the best posture for the United States military forces.” In the statement, White House National Security Council spokesman John Ullyot said the United States remained committed to working with Germany on defense and other issues. The move, first reported by the Wall Street Journal, is the latest twist in relations between Berlin and Washington, which have often been strained during Trump’s presidency. Trump has pressed Germany to raise defense spending and accused Berlin of being a “captive” of Russia due to its energy reliance.About 17,000 US civilian employees support US troops in Germany. It is believed the United States also has nuclear warheads there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-orders-big-us-troop-cut-in-germany-official-says/story-s78bhcueNCQaSbgeK6nTfO.html

06-06-2020||World||‘No kneeling’: Trump renews criticism of protests during US anthem||President Donald Trump on Friday lobbed barbs at protesters who kneel during the national anthem, after NFL quarterback Drew Brees apologized for remarks he made about the practice.Brees said this week he would “never agree with anybody disrespecting the flag,” referring to the possibility of players kneeling during the “Star-Spangled Banner” in the upcoming NFL season. Brees apologized Thursday, saying his words “lacked awareness and any type of compassion or empathy.”The kneeling pose, popularized by NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick, has become a symbol of the fight for racial justice in the United States.Trump tweeted on Friday that Brees “should not have taken back his original stance.”“We should be standing up straight and tall, ideally with a salute, or a hand on heart,” Trump wrote. “There are other things you can protest, but not our Great American Flag - NO KNEELING!”The kneeling pose has been seen at protests in cities across the country in the wake of the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, while in police custody in Minneapolis.Brees’ initial remarks angered top athletes, who objected to the equating of the protest with disrespecting the American flag.“You literally still don’t understand why Kap was kneeling on one knee??” NBA great LeBron James posted on Twitter earlier this week. “Has absolute nothing to do with the disrespect of Flag of United States and our soldiers(men and women).”Kaepernick popularized the move in 2016, appearing on NFL sidelines first sitting, and later kneeling, during the customary pre-game airing of the US national anthem.Trump was an early critic of the protest, and in 2017 Vice President Mike Pence walked out of an NFL game between the 49ers and the Indianapolis Colts when some of the players knelt on the sidelines during the anthem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-kneeling-trump-renews-criticism-of-protests-during-us-anthem/story-WJS6EJr0lJmf9AcHRtx2yI.html
06-06-2020||World||Biden formally clinches Democratic presidential nomination||Joe Biden formally clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Friday, setting him up for a bruising challenge to President Donald Trump that will play out against the unprecedented backdrop of a pandemic, economic collapse and civil unrest.The former vice president has effectively been his party’s leader since his last challenger in the Democratic primary, Bernie Sanders, ended his campaign in April. But Biden pulled together the 1,991 delegates needed to become the nominee after seven states and the District of Columbia held presidential primaries Tuesday.Biden reached the threshold three days after the primaries because several states, overwhelmed by huge increases in mail ballots, took days to tabulate results. Teams of analysts at The Associated Press then parsed the votes into individual congressional districts. Democrats award most delegates to the party’s national convention based on results in individual congressional districts.Biden now has 1,993 delegates, with contests still to come in eight states and three US territories.The moment was met with little of the traditional fanfare as the nation confronts overlapping crises. While Biden has started to venture out more this week, the coronavirus pandemic has largely confined him to his Wilmington, Delaware, home for much of the past three months.The country faces the worst rate of unemployment since the Great Depression. And civil unrest that harkens back to the 1960s has erupted in dozens of cities following the death of George Floyd, a black man who died when a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck for several minutes even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.It’s a confluence of events that no US leader has faced in modern times, made all the more complicated by a president who has at times antagonized the protesters and is eager to take the fight to Biden.Biden spent 36 years in the Senate before becoming Barack Obama’s vice president. This is 77-year-old Biden’s third bid for the presidency and his success in capturing the Democratic nomination was driven by strong support from black voters.He finished an embarrassing fourth place in the overwhelmingly white Iowa caucuses that kicked off the nomination process in February. Biden fared little better in the New Hampshire primary, where his standing was so low that he left the state before polls closed on election night to instead rally black voters in South Carolina.His rebound began in the more diverse caucuses in Nevada but solidified in South Carolina, where Biden stomped Sanders, his nearest rival, by nearly 29 points. He followed that with a dominant showing three days later during the Super Tuesday contests, taking 9 of the 13 states.Biden’s strong showing in states such as North Carolina, Virginia, Tennessee and Texas reinforced his status as the preferred Democratic candidate of African American voters — but the relationship has not been without its strained moments. After a tense exchange with an influential black radio host, Biden took sharp criticism for suggesting that African American voters still deciding between him and Trump “ain’t black.”That comment, and protests that have spread nationwide, have increased pressure on Biden to pick an African American running mate. He has already committed to picking a woman as a vice presidential candidate.Black voters are unlikely to back Trump over Biden by a wide margin. A recent Fox News poll shows just 14% of African Americans who are registered to vote have a favorable opinion of the president compared with 75% who favorably view Biden.But Biden must ensure that black voters are motivated to show up to the polls in November, especially in critical swing states that narrowly went for Trump in 2016.At one point, the Democratic primary included dozens of candidates of different races, genders and generations and an openly gay man. The contest was dominated by debate over unapologetically progressive ideas, including fully government-funded health care under “Medicare for All” and a sweeping proposal to combat climate change known as the “Green New Deal.”Biden prevailed by mostly offering more moderate approaches that he argued would make him more electable against Trump.He refused to budge on his rejection of universal health care and some of the Green New Deal’s most ambitious provisions to combat climate change.Since clinching the nomination, however, Biden has worked to build his appeal among progressives, forming joint task forces with Sanders’ campaign to find common ground on key issues like health care, the economy and the environment. Biden has also embraced a plan to forgive millions of Americans’ student debt, meaning that he clinches the nomination as easily the most liberal standard bearer the Democratic Party has ever had.Biden’s embrace of his party’s left flank could help him consolidate a Democratic base that remained deeply divided after the 2016 primary and ultimately hurt Hillary Clinton in her defeat to Trump. But it could also undermine Biden’s attempts to rebuild the Obama coalition, which is often loosely defined as minorities and young people, as well as educated Americans and some working-class voters.The former vice president has sought, since announcing his candidacy, to cast the election as a battle “for the soul of the nation,” and promised to restore order and dignity to the White House while rehabilitating the U.S. image on the world stage. Such an approach, though, necessarily focuses on being more of an alternative to Trump than offering radically new political ideas. And that further underscores Biden’s difficult task of trying to unite his party’s base while appealing to voters from far beyond it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-formally-clinches-democratic-presidential-nomination/story-sejUoQZzInFJ925BuPFqlK.html
06-06-2020||World||Patten says China pursuing ‘Orwellian’ agenda in Hong Kong||The last British governor of Hong Kong criticized the Chinese government on Friday over proposed national security legislation, calling it part of an “Orwellian” drive to eliminate opposition in violation of the agreement on handing the territory over to Beijing. Chris Patten defended London’s announcement that it would grant residency and a path to citizenship for nearly 3 million Hong Kong residents if Beijing goes through with passage of the legislation. The law is seen as potentially imposing severe restrictions on freedom of speech and opposition political activity in the former British colony that was handed over to Chinese rule in 1997. China has denounced the offer of citizenship as a violation of its sovereignty. “If they’ve broken the (Sino-British) Joint Declaration, if they’ve thrown it overboard, how can they then use the joint declaration as though it stops us doing something that’s a sovereign right of ours?” said Patten, now chancellor of the University of Oxford, in an online talk with reporters. The declaration is a bilateral treaty signed as part of the handover process. China has essentially declared it null and void, while Britain says Beijing is reneging on its commitments made in the document that was supposed to be remain in effect until 2047. China shocked many of Hong Kong’s 7.5 million people when it announced earlier this month that it will enact a national security law for the city, which was promised a high level of autonomy outside of foreign and defense affairs. An earlier push to pass security legislation was shelved after massive Hong Kong street protests against it in 2003. However, Beijing appeared to lose patience after months of sometimes violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year that China said was an attempt to split the territory off from the rest of the country. Patten said the security legislation is unnecessary because Hong Kong’s legal code already includes provisions to combat terrorism, financial crimes and other threats to security. “What Beijing wants is something which deals with those rather worrying Orwellian crimes like sedition, whatever that may be,” Patten said. China may also be seeking grounds to disqualify opposition candidates from running in September’s election for the local legislature by accusing them of being disloyal, he said. Beijing has ignored promises that Hong Kong could democratize of its own accord after the handover, Patten said. The US should unite with other democratic countries to oppose underhanded tactics by Beijing, he said. “It’s the Chinese Communist Party which attacks us, which hectors, which bullies, which tells companies which have roots in our countries, that unless they do what China wants, they won’t get any business in China,” Patten said. “That’s the way the Mafia behave, and the rest of the world shouldn’t put up with it, because if we do, liberal democracies are going to be screwed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/patten-says-china-pursuing-orwellian-agenda-in-hong-kong/story-6lL6DjPT5dUsPfyTiKpziP.html

The nation reported another 1,005 deaths Friday night.With more than 35,000 lives lost, the pandemic has killed more people in Brazil than anywhere outside of the United States and the United Kingdom.Asked about efforts to loosen social distancing orders in Brazil despite rising daily death rates and diagnoses, World Health Organization (WHO) spokeswoman Margaret Harris said a key criteria for lifting lockdowns was slowing transmission.“The epidemic, the outbreak, in Latin America is deeply, deeply concerning,” she told a news conference in Geneva. Among six key criteria for easing quarantines, she said, “one of them is ideally having your transmission declining.”In comments to journalists later Friday, Bolsonaro said Brazil will consider leaving the WHO unless it ceases to be a “partisan political organization.”President Donald Trump, an ideological ally of Bolsonaro, said last month that the United States would end its own relationship with the WHO, accusing it of becoming a puppet of China, where the coronavirus first emerged.Bolsonaro’s dismissal of the coronavirus risks to public health and efforts to lift state quarantines have drawn criticism from across the political spectrum in Brazil, where some accuse him of using the crisis to undermine democratic institutions.But many of those critics are divided about the safety and effectiveness of anti-government demonstrations in the middle of a pandemic, especially after one small protest was met with an overwhelming show of police force last weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bolsonaro-threatens-who-exit-as-covid-19-kills-a-brazilian-per-minute/story-ciXJHm6usOF6l45NxnezzK.html

He was joined by Somali-Canadian Cabinet colleague Ahmed Hussen, the Minister for Families, Children and Social Development.Trudeau kneeled for nearly nine minutes, at the rally that took place on Parliament Hill in Ottawa. Though videos of the event showed there were scattered shouts of “Go away” from some in the crowd, Trudeau nodded along to chants of ‘Black lives matter’. Some of the shouts also included the term blackface, referring to the multiple photographs and videos of the Prime Minister that emerged late year with his face darkened.The Canadian Prime Minister has been criticized and ridiculed for a 21-second long pause during a recent media briefing when he was asked about the words and actions of United States President Donald Trump. Trudeau did not mention Trump even once in the response that followed the silence. He did not address the protest gathering on Friday. However, Hussen, the only black member of Trudeau’s Cabinet, told the outlet CBC, “I think it’s powerful when you have the head of government taking a knee and clapping when people say ‘black lives matter’.”Trudeau’s presence at the protest comes days after Dr Theresa Tam, Canada’s chief public health officer, warned against such gathering because of the Covid-19 threat and advised virtual rallies instead.Similar marches also took place in other Canadian cities including Toronto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-trudeau-joins-a-black-lives-matter-rally-kneels-for-9-minutes/story-z3NftAlkgENXoQ2X2DqS9J.html

His appearance came a day after police shot and killed an indigenous woman during a wellness check in eastern Canada. Demonstrations were held in other Canadian cities on Friday, including Toronto, where hundreds walked downtown in protests sparked by the death of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, while in police custody in Minnesota.Trudeau three times took a knee alongside other protesters, a gesture used to protest against police brutality and the treatment of African-Americans by police. Afterward, several people thanked Trudeau for kneeling.On Monday, police tear-gassed peaceful protesters outside the White House to make way for President Donald Trump to have his picture taken holding a Bible while standing in front of a church.Asked to comment on Trump’s idea of using soldiers against protesters on Tuesday, the Liberal prime minister paused for more than 20 seconds before he said that Canadians were watching the United States with “horror and consternation.”Trudeau did not speak at the rally Friday and left as the protesters began a march to the US Embassy, near the Parliament building. “What needs to happen is long-term change,” said Sisi Akhigbe, 24, who raised more than C$9,000 online to provide drinks and snacks for the protesters in Ottawa. “We’ve been treated unfairly and we’re tired.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stand-up-to-trump-canada-protesters-shout-to-trudeau-who-kneels-at-anti-racism-rally/story-AkHvydvcjniB0XsvXVhMCO.html
06-06-2020||World||‘A great day for George Floyd,’ says Trump as he hails strong jobs report for US||President Donald Trump on Friday declared it was “a great day” for George Floyd as he discussed a strong jobs report for the country and efforts to bring about racial equality. Joe Biden, the likely Democratic presidential nominee, said Trump’s comments about Floyd were “despicable.”  Trump’s comments about Floyd came as he shifted from discussing a drop in the unemployment rate to say everyone deserved “equal treatment in every encounter with law enforcement, regardless of race, color, gender or creed.” “We all saw what happened last week. We can’t let that happen,” Trump said.  “Hopefully George is looking down right now and saying this is a great thing that’s happening for our country.” He added: “This is a great day for him. It’s a great day for everybody. This is a great day for everybody. This is a great, great day in terms of equality.”  Floyd, who was black, died after a white police officer pressed his knee on Floyd’s neck for several minutes, ignoring Floyd’s cries that he couldn’t breathe and bystander shouts. Floyd’s death set off protests around the world, including outside the White House.Trump spoke shortly after the government said the unemployment rate had dropped to 13.3%, better than expected but still on par with Great Depression-era levels of joblessness. He offered the data as evidence that the nation had overcome the worst of the coronavirus pandemic and had begun an economic comeback.Biden panned Trump’s comments during an economic speech in Delaware.“We’re speaking of a man who was brutally killed by an act of needless violence and by a larger tide of injustice that has metastasized on this president’s watch,” Biden said.“George Floyd’s last words, ‘I can’t breathe. I can’t breathe,’ have echoed all across this nation and quite frankly around the world,” Biden added. “For the president to try to put any other words in the mouth of George Floyd, I frankly think, is despicable.” Trump campaign communications director Tim Murtaugh said some news outlets had “purposely misreported” the president’s comments to insinuate that Floyd would be pleased about the positive jobs numbers. He said Trump was referencing the “national conversation” that followed Floyd’s death and “Americans coming together on the belief that everyone should be treated equally under the law.” “The sentences that preceded and followed the president’s sentiments about Mr. Floyd made the context crystal clear,” Murtaugh said. “Media claims that the president said that Mr. Floyd would be praising the economic news are wrong, purposefully misrepresented, and maliciously crafted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-evokes-floyd-after-hailing-strong-jobs-report/story-24o9MTPitHAtzFd60VATIO.html
06-06-2020||World||Killed al-Qaeda’s North African commander, claims France||French forces have killed Abdelmalek Droukdel, the leader of al-Qaeda’s North Africa affiliate, the France’s defense minister announced late Friday, in what would be a major victory for France after years of battling jihadists in the Sahel.There was no immediate confirmation of his death from al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, known as AQIM, which has made millions of dollars abducting foreigners for ransom over the years and made large swaths of West Africa too dangerous for aid groups to access.French Defense Minister Florence Parly tweeted that Droukdel and several of his allies were killed Wednesday in northern Mali by French forces and their partners. It was not immediately clear how his identity was confirmed by the French.Droukdel’s reported death comes after French President Emmanuel Macron and the leaders of the G5 Sahel group -- Mauritania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger and Chad -- launched a new plan in January to fight jihadists in the area. France deployed 600 additional soldiers to its Barkhane force, raising the number of troops there to 5,100.In a March video released by the extremist monitoring group SITE, Droukdel urged governments of the Sahel region to try to end the French military presence, calling the troops “armies of occupation.” It was not clear how long Droukdel had been in Mali, Algeria’s southern neighbor. For years he was thought to be holed up in the Kabyle region east of the capital of his native Algeria, and many people had questioned why he was never captured by Algerian security forces, which had honed their counter-terrorism skills over the decades.He was widely seen as the symbolic leader of al Qaeda’s North African branch, whose operational center for attacks shifted to northern Mali over the past decade. That led to the French military invasion of the region in 2013 seeking to counter Islamist extremist designs on southern Mali and the capital, Bamako.Droukdel made his reputation as a feared extremist leader in Algeria, which beginning in the early 1990s was convulsed by violence in what the nation now calls the “black decade.” Droukdel’s al Qaeda affiliate had claimed responsibility for numerous deadly suicide bombings in Algeria, including targeting a United Nations building in Algiers in 2007, shattered by a vehicle packed with explosives.Droukdel, also known by the nom de guerre Abu Musab Abdul Wadud, transformed the Salafist Group for Call and Combat, known as the GSPC, into al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, spreading the movement across Africa’s Sahel region under the umbrella of the global terror network.More recently he had been commanding all the al-Qaeda groups in North Africa and the Sahel, including the JNIM, which has claimed responsibility for devastating attacks on the Malian military and U.N. peacekeepers trying to stabilize the volatile country.Parly identified him as a member of al-Qaeda’s “management committee.” Related anti-terrorist operations in the region also led to the arrest May 19 of a major figure in the Islamic State in the Greater Sahara, Mohamed el Mrabat, she said.She said the operations dealt a “severe blow” to terrorist groups in the region that have been operating for years despite the presence of thousands of French, U.N. and other African troops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/killed-al-qaeda-s-north-african-commander-france-s-defense-minister/story-klNoPp9tEYAjb863qkAxHN.html
06-06-2020||World||North Korea threatens to shut liaison office with South||North Korea on Friday threatened to permanently shut a liaison office with South Korea as it continued to condemn its rival for failing to prevent activists from sending anti-North Korean leaflets across the border.The statement by North Korea’s ruling Workers’ Party came a day after the powerful sister of leader Kim Jong Un said the country would end a military agreement reached with South Korea in 2018 to reduce tensions if Seoul fails to stop the activists.Kim Yo Jong also said North Korea could permanently shut the liaison office and a joint factory park in the border town of Kaesong, which have been symbols of reconciliation between the two countries.Desperate to keep alive a faltering diplomacy with North Korea, South Korea in response said it would push new laws to ban activists from flying leaflets by balloon to the North, which triggered a debate over freedom of speech.But an unidentified spokesperson of the Workers’ Party’s inter-Korean affairs department said Seoul’s promise lacked sincerity and the scrapping of the liaison office will be the first in a series of North Korean steps that would cause “extreme fatigue” for the South.The statement also confirmed an elevated status for Kim Yo Jong, who was described as her brother’s top official for inter-Korean affairs.Under her instructions, North Korea has decided as a first step to “abolish the North-South liaison office that is occupying space in the Kaesong industrial complex while doing nothing,” the statement said.“We will not hide that we for a long time have considered decisive measures to completely shut down all spaces of contact with the South and fundamentally eliminate the sources of provocations from the South,” said the spokesperson of the party’s United Front Department.“The latest events have strengthened our conclusion that an enemy is just an enemy...it is our determination to go as far as we can in a vicious cycle of confrontation.” South Korea’s government had no immediate reaction to the statement.Sending balloons across the border has been a common activist tactic for years, but North Korea considers it an attack on its government. Defectors and other activists in recent weeks have used balloons to fly leaflets criticizing Kim Jong Un over his nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record.While Seoul has sometimes sent police officers to block such activities during sensitive times, it had previously resisted North Korea’s calls to fully ban them, saying the activists were exercising their freedom.The liaison office in Kaesong was one of the main agreements reached in three summits between Kim Jong Un and South Korean President Moon Jae-in in 2018. It has been closed since late January after the Koreas agreed to temporarily shut it until the coronavirus is controlled.Kaesong is also the location of a now-shuttered factory complex that was jointly run by the two Koreas. It combined South Korean capital and technology with cheap North Korean labour. Seoul’s previous conservative government shut it down in 2016 following a North Korean nuclear test, removing a crucial cash source for North Korea’s struggling economy.During their summits in 2018, Kim and Moon issued vaguely worded statements pledging denuclearization and peace. They also agreed to the military pact aimed at reducing conventional threats and vowed to resume operations at the Kaesong factory park and South Korean tours to a resort at North Korea’s Diamond Mountain when possible, expressing optimism that US-led sanctions on the North would end.But North Korea has suspended virtually all cooperation with South Korea in recent months amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations with the Trump administration, which have faltered over disagreements on sanctions relief in exchange for disarmament steps.North Korea has sped up its missile tests while also pressuring Seoul to break away from Washington and restart joint economic projects held back by the sanctions over its nuclear programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-threatens-to-shut-liaison-office-with-south/story-mFy1OEZLJ2uYTc4aDa5yKN.html
06-06-2020||World||EU wants borders free of virus restrictions by end of June||Europe could have its free travel zone up and running again by the end of this month, but travellers from further afield will not be allowed in before July, a European Union commissioner said Friday after talks among the bloc’s interior ministers.Panicked by Italy’s coronavirus outbreak in February, countries in the 26-nation Schengen travel zone — where people and goods move freely without border checks — imposed border restrictions without consulting their neighbours to try to keep the disease out. The moves caused massive border traffic jams and blocked medical equipment.Free movement is a jewel in Europe’s crown that helps its businesses flourish and many European officials feared that the very future of the Schengen area was under threat from coronavirus travel restrictions. These added to border pressures already caused by the arrival in Europe of well over 1 million migrants in 2015.“I personally believe that we will return to a full functioning of the Schengen area and freedom of movement of citizens no later than the end of the month of June,” European Union Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said Friday after the video-conference meeting.All but essential travel into Europe from the outside is restricted until June 15, but many ministers suggested Friday that they want this deadline extended until early July.The meeting came as the Czech Republic was easing restrictions with some of its neighbours; Austria, Germany and Hungary. Also Friday, Switzerland said it plans to lift restrictions on travel from EU nations and Britain on June 15. Switzerland is not an EU member but is part of the Schengen travel zone.Johansson said Europe’s Centre for Disease Prevention and Control believes that confinement, social distancing and other health measures are working. More than 175,000 people have died in Europe’s coronavirus outbreak, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, mostly in Britain, Italy, France and Spain.“Physical distancing and other health-related measures are still needed, of course. But health authorities are clear that there is no longer a clear justification for either travel restrictions or border measures within the EU Schengen area,” Johansson said.German Interior Minister Horst Seehofer, whose country plans to lift its remaining border checks on June 15 like many other EU countries, said “the internal border controls will be over in all of Europe at the end of June.” The news should come as a relief to millions of Europeans still trying to work out their summer vacation plans — which begin for many in July once the school year is over — and who are anxious to know whether they will be allowed to head to the continent’s beaches or mountains.It’s also good news for European countries whose economies have been ravaged by the spread of COVID-19 and are hoping for a much-needed boost from their decimated tourism industries.But the perception that Italy is still dangerous is weighing heavily on its tourism sector, which along with related industries accounts for 13% of Italy’s gross domestic product.In an apparent reference to Austria and Greece, which have not fully opened to Italian tourists, Italian Foreign Minister Luigi Di Maio denounced the “ad hoc” measures put in place by some countries as “a violation of the European spirit that has always distinguished us.” Di Maio said Rome would provide regular infection data to Austria “so they can have certainty about Italy’s numbers.” Last week, he said Italy refused to be treated as a leper after Greece announced a list of 29 countries whose citizens could visit without testing or quarantine requirements, but excluded Italians, Britons and residents of other hard-hit countries.Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez and Italian Premier Giuseppe Conte have sent a joint letter to European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen urging “the lifting of restrictions at our internal borders (...) in a coordinated, non-discriminatory manner.” The letter was shared with media in Spain on Friday.The government leaders of the eurozone’s third- and fourth-largest economies want the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control to play a leading role in “defining as soon as possible these criteria together with the member states.” Spain, which relies on tourism for 12% of its GDP, plans to wait until July 1 to drop its 14-day quarantine requirement for everyone who crosses its borders, Spaniards included.“Many of our member states are approaching the date when they are going to reopen their borders to tourist mobility,” Sánchez and Conte wrote. “How this process is carried out will largely determine our citizens’ perception of the centrality of the European Union in tackling this crisis.” Germany’s Seehofer said most of the EU’s interior ministers want to extend the current entry ban on outside travelers “by 14 days until July 1.” Visitors from the United States, Russia or Brazil, for example, would only be allowed back into Europe on based on how those nations have brought the spread of the virus under control, he said. Those three nations account for 44% of the world’s confirmed infections and nearly 38% of the world’s confirmed coronavirus deaths, according to Johns Hopkins. Worldwide, 6.6 million people have been confirmed infected by the virus and over 391,000 have died, according to Johns Hopkins, but experts say the tally understates the true toll of the pandemic due to limited testing, missed mild cases and deliberate government undercounts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-wants-borders-free-of-virus-restrictions-by-end-of-june/story-g8NsSqRMtq5o6YjHGWYrYN.html

It did not say who made the complaint.The Burbank, California lawyer who requested the takedown, Sam Koolaq, declined to identify his client or the copyright violation in the video. He said in an email that he also submitted takedown notices to YouTube, Facebook and Instagram.Facebook, which owns Instagram, took the video down later on Friday. “We received a copyright complaint from the creator under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act and have removed the post,” Facebook said in a statement. YouTube did not respond to a request for comment.The three minute and 45 second clip is a montage of photos and videos of peaceful marches and police officers hugging protesters interspersed with some scenes of burning buildings and vandalism, set to gentle piano music and Trump speaking.Last month, Twitter placed fact-check warnings on two tweets from Trump’s own account that called mail-in ballots “fraudulent” and predicted problems with the November U.S. elections. Under the tweets, there is now a link reading “Get the facts about mail-in ballots” that guides users to a Twitter “moments” page with fact checks and news stories about Trump’s unsubstantiated claims.It also demoted and placed a stronger warning on a third Trump tweet about Minneapolis protests that read, in part, that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.” Twitter said that the tweet had violated the platform’s rules by glorifying violence.Trump responded by threatening to retaliate against social media companies.Last year, Twitter also removed a Trump tweet that featured a doctored Nickelback music video clip that took aim at former Vice President Joe Biden, after receiving copyright complaints.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-disables-trump-campaign-s-george-floyd-video-tribute/story-Mdx3cu64FPycMLsJJveR5K.html
06-06-2020||World||AstraZeneca ties up with Indian company to produce potential vaccine||Biopharma major AstraZeneca has entered into an agreement with the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII), among other world-wide vaccine manufacturers, to produce the vaccine currently under trial at the University of Oxford on a mass scale, if successful.“Our vaccine work is progressing quickly”, the university said on Friday. It recently announced the start of a Phase II/III trial of the vaccine in about 10,000 adult volunteers with other late-stage trials due to begin in a number of countries around the world.The agreements, reached on a not-for-profit basis includes a $750 million agreement with the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations founded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Gavi, the vaccine alliance, to support the manufacturing, procurement and distribution of 300 million doses of the vaccine, with delivery starting by the end of the year.“In addition, the university and industry partnership reached a licensing agreement with SII to supply one billion doses for low-and-middle-income countries, with a commitment to provide 400 million before the end of 2020”, the university said.Adar Poonawalla, SII’s chief executive officer, said: “Serum Institute of India is delighted to partner with AstraZeneca in bringing this vaccine to India as well as low-and-middle-income countries”.“Over the past 50 years SII has built significant capability in vaccine manufacturing and supply globally. We will work closely with AstraZeneca to ensure fair and equitable distribution of the vaccine in these countries,” he added.AstraZeneca recently agreed to supply 400 million doses to the US and UK after reaching a licence agreement with Oxford for its recombinant adenovirus vaccine.Adrian Hill, director of the Jenner Institute at Oxford, said: “We are delighted to see this major agreement with global industry partners which brings to fruition the goal of Oxford University and AstraZeneca to help ensure very large scale fair and equitable Covid-19 vaccine provision in low to middle income countries around the world”.The university said that together, the agreements reached mark the latest commitments to enable global access to the vaccine, including to low-and-middle-income countries, beyond the company’s recent partnerships with the UK and US.AstraZeneca is building a number of supply chains in parallel across the world to support global access at no profit during the pandemic and has so far secured manufacturing capacity for two billion doses of the vaccine, it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biopharma-major-astrazeneca-ties-up-with-indian-institute-to-produce-potential-vaccine/story-UF9yLSQLRQSKX6NNemnFRK.html
