The announcement comes in response to moves by China to impose new security legislation on Hong Kong, which prompted US President Donald Trump last month to initiate a process to eliminate special economic treatment that has allowed the territory to remain a global financial center.It also comes at a time of intensified US rhetoric against China in the midst of Trump’s re-election campaign, in which opinion polls have shown voters increasingly embittered toward Beijing, especially over the coronavirus, which began in that country.“President Trump promised to punish the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) officials who were responsible for eviscerating Hong Kong’s freedoms. Today, we are taking action to do just that,” Pompeo said in the statement.He said China’s Communist Party had stepped up efforts to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy through the national security legislation and by putting pressure on local authorities to arrest pro-democracy activists and disqualify pro-democracy electoral candidates.Pompeo called on China to honor its commitment to allow Hong Kong “a high degree of autonomy” and added: “The United States will continue to review its authorities to respond to these concerns.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-imposes-visa-restrictions-on-chinese-officials-over-hong-kong-autonomy/story-Uia1VexglIKCflA3QiLOhN.html
26-06-2020||World||US records nearly 40k virus cases in a day; total cases 10 times more than reported, say experts||A top public health official has said that the actual number of cumulative Covid-19 infections in the United States is around 10 times the reported number, which stood at 2.42 million Friday as the surge in new cases continued unabated with infections going up by nearly 40,000 in another one-day record.Daily fatalities that had fallen into three-digit numbers have rebounded into the thousands at 2,423, taking the toll to 124,415. The spike in new infections was being reported mostly from souther and western states of Florida, Texas, Arizona and California — some of whom paused their reopening, such as Texas — and were fueled by younger people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who are socialising more as stay-at-home restrictions, are lifted, and without taking the usual precautions.“Our best estimate right now is that for every case that’s reported, there actually are 10 other infections,” Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), told reporters Thursday, taking up the estimate of infections to at least 24 million.Blood samples collected for testing antibodies showed that for every confirmed infection there were 10 people with antibodies but no symptoms.“The traditional approach of looking for symptomatic illness, and diagnoses obviously underestimated the total number of infections,” Redfield said. “Now that serology tests are available, which test for antibodies, the estimates we have right now show about 10 times more people have antibodies in the jurisdictions tested than had documented infections.”New infections went up by 39,972 in the United States in the past 24 hours, marking a new daily high, spotlighting that epidemic is far from over, as the Trump administration had been keen to convey in the president’s hurry to put behind a crisis that could cast a shadow on his re-election.Vice President Mike Pence, who leads the White House coronavirus task force, said Friday Covid-19 cases were rising “precipitously” in 16 states, mostly in southern United States , as the number of new infections went up to 40,000 in the last 24 hours, marking a new one-day high.Fatalities were up to 126,000, he added. The spike in new infections was being reported mostly from souther and western states of Florida, Texas, Arizona and California — some of whom paused their reopening, such as Texas — and were fueled by younger people in their 20s, 30s and 40s who are socializing more as stay-at-home restrictions, are lifted, and without taking the usual precautions.“Roughly half of the new cases are Americans under the age of 25,” said Pence, naming Florida and Texas, specifically, leading a briefing by task force after almost two months, in recognition of the gravity of the crisis brought on by the new surge.New infections went up by more than 40,000 in the United States in the past 24 hours, marking a new daily high and serving a grim reminder that the epidemic was far from over, as the Trump administration had been keen to convey in the president’s hurry to put behind a crisis that could cast a shadow on his re-election.Some states halted their reopening plans as a result of increasing cases. Texas Governor Greg Abbott has put it on hold entirely, and brought back some restrictions. “The last thing we want to do as a state is go backwards and close down businesses,” he said in a statement on Thursday. But in light of the growing gravity of the crisis in the state, that’s exactly what he did Friday morning, by reviving restrictions on bars and restaurants and certain outdoor activities.Florida also brought back some restriction, prohibiting sale of alcohol at bars.Things are far worse than the existing numbers conveys. “Our best estimate right now is that for every case that’s reported, there actually are 10 other infections,” Robert Redfield, head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and a member of the task force, told reporters Thursday, taking up the estimate of infections to at least 24 million.Blood samples collected for testing antibodies showed that for every confirmed infection there were 10 people with antibodies but no symptoms.“The traditional approach of looking for symptomatic illness, and diagnoses obviously underestimated the total number of infections,” Redfield said. “Now that serology tests are available, which test for antibodies, the estimates we have right now show about 10 times more people have antibodies in the jurisdictions tested than had documented infections.”US treasury department, in the meantime, was reported to have mailed 1 million checks, worth an estimated $1.4 billion of the Covid-19 relief package of $2 trillion for businesses, families and the unemployed, to dead people, according to a watchdog report to US congress. More than160 million Americans received direct payments in all that added up to $269 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-records-nearly-40k-virus-cases-in-a-day-total-cases-10-times-more-than-reported-say-experts/story-CkvuT0LZhJtYHxwxqSs23K.html
26-06-2020||World||AstraZeneca, Moderna ahead in Covid-19 vaccine race: World Health Organisation||AstraZeneca’s experimental Covid-19 vaccine is probably the world’s leading candidate and most advanced in terms of development, the World Health Organization’s (WHO) chief scientist said on Friday.The British drugmaker has already begun large-scale, mid-stage human trials of the vaccine, which was developed by researchers at University of Oxford. This week, AstraZeneca signed its tenth supply and manufacturing deal.“Certainly in terms of how advanced they are, the stage at which they are, they are I think probably the leading candidate,” WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a news conference. “So it’s possible they will have results quite early.”Swaminathan said Moderna’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate was “not far behind” AstraZeneca’s, among more than 200 candidates, 15 of which have entered clinical trials.“We do know that Moderna’s vaccine is also going to go into phase three clinical trials, probably from the middle of July, and so that vaccine candidate is not far behind,” she said.“But I think AstraZeneca certainly has a more global scope at the moment in terms of where they are doing and planning their vaccine trials.”The WHO is in talks with multiple Chinese manufacturers, including Sinovac, on potential vaccines, as well as with Indian researchers, Swaminathan said.She called for drugmakers to consider collaborating on Covid-19 vaccine trials, similar to the WHO’s ongoing Solidarity trial for drugs. A WHO led coalition fighting the pandemic on Friday asked government and private sector donors to help raise $31.3 billion in the next 12 months to develop and deliver tests, treatments and vaccines for the disease. The initiative is called the ACT-Accelerator.Andrew Witty, Special Envoy for the ACT-Accelerator, said it was important to consider a “portfolio of research efforts” for vaccines.“It’s still very early days in this journey, we may be super lucky - which would be terrific - and have an early win,” Witty said. “Even if it takes 12 to 18 months that would be without precedent, the world’s fast development of vaccine.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-moderna-ahead-in-covid-19-vaccine-race-world-health-organisation/story-I3hNAWBKx78MIuYYZrxiyO.html

No one else was killed and the incident was not terror related.Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was “deeply saddened by the terrible incident in Glasgow”, while home secretary Priti Patel said reports from Glasgow were “deeply disturbing”, and Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the incident was “truly dreadful”.The police said: “A man was shot by armed police and has died. Six other men are in hospital for treatment, including a 42-year-old police officer, who is in a critical but stable condition. The officer’s family is aware”.“The other men in hospital are aged 17, 18, 20, 38 and 53. Liaison officers have been appointed. Our thoughts are with the families of those who were injured, including our officer. The incident is not being treated as terrorism related and our investigation is continuing into the circumstances”, the statement added.The police added that there is no wider risk to the public. Witnesses said they saw a man of African heritage lying on the ground as the police moved in.Sturgeon said: “First and foremost my thoughts are with all those people who have been caught up in this terrible incident, particularly the six injured people taken to hospital for treatment, as well as residents and staff at the hotel”.“While such a serious incident is rare in Scotland it is another reminder of the courage and professionalism of our police officers who are willing to run towards danger in order to protect the lives of others”.“Clearly there is already much speculation around this incident, which remains under investigation. I would urge everyone to avoid such speculation, to not share potentially harmful or upsetting material on social media and to follow police advice while investigations are underway”, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-who-stabbed-3-to-death-in-glasgow-hotel-shot-dead-by-police/story-32FWN3l8q7qS6F8Edy2aVO.html

Local authorities struggled, while residents wanted the beaches closed.Lockdown measures are to be further eased from July 4, amidst concern from experts from the World Health Organisation and others that they are being eased in the UK too soon. The easing has been prompted by dwindling infections in recent days and weeks.Johnson said during a visit to a restaurant in London: “It’s crucial that people understand that on July 4 we get this right - we do this in a balanced way and we recognise the risks”.“And so I say to everybody, you may think that you’re not going to get it and you’re immortal and invincible and so on - and very likely that’s true, particularly if you’re a young person - but the bug you carry can kill elderly people particularly”.“It is still dangerous and the virus is still out there. To win, to beat this thing, we have to stay alert and do this in a balanced way,” he added.Officials said that if scenes similar to those in Bournemouth and elsewhere continued, local lockdowns may have to be imposed.A Downing Street spokesperson said: “Everyone should be able to enjoy the sunshine, and we understand that people want to enjoy public spaces, but it is important we don’t undo the hard work of the British public in reducing the transmission of this virus”.“We have been clear that should we see case numbers increase we will introduce local lockdowns”.As of Thursday evening, the UK had recorded 43,230 deaths and 307,980 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-still-out-there-uk-pm-boris-warns-partying-britons/story-5zhJLVS9sqIEZlste3b0HK.html
26-06-2020||World||Trump wants federal hiring to focus on skills over degrees||President Donald Trump is preparing to direct the federal government to overhaul its hiring to prioritise a job applicant’s skills over a college degree, administration and industry officials say.Trump is set to sign an executive order Friday outlining a new direction for the nation’s largest employer during a meeting of the board that advises the administration on worker policy.Ivanka Trump, the president’s daughter and adviser, is co-chair of the American Workforce Policy Advisory Board and has worked on improving job training to meet employers’ changing needs.The federal government is the nation’s largest employer with 2.1 million civilian workers, excluding postal service employees.Ivanka Trump predicted the change in federal government hiring would create a more inclusive and talented workforce. She encouraged the private sector to follow the administration’s lead.“We are modernising federal hiring to find candidates with the relevant competencies and knowledge, rather than simply recruiting based on degree requirements,” she told The Associated Press in a statement.  “We encourage employers everywhere to take a look at their hiring practices and think critically about how initiatives like these can help diversify and strengthen their workforce.” Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, the board’s other co-chair, said the need for skills training and apprenticeships is as great as it was before the coronavirus pandemic forced millions of people out of work, pushing the national unemployment rate above 13% in May.“Americans are eager to get to work but they need our help,” Ross told AP.The White House isn’t eliminating degree requirements altogether but instead will stress skills in jobs where having a degree is less important.Aides say the change will create more opportunities for Americans to work for the federal government by recognising that some learning happens outside of classrooms.Ivanka Trump and other administration officials have pushed to increase opportunities for apprenticeships and have promoted such training and vocational education as alternatives to traditional two-year or four-year college degree programmes.The Office of Personnel Management will be responsible for implementing the president’s order.IBM is among the companies that have moved in this direction. Last year, 15% of its new US hires had nontraditional backgrounds because they were evaluated based on skills instead of looking only at their degrees, Ginni Rometty, the company’s executive chairman, said via the White House.“We hired from new areas of the country, including under-served communities, and this promoted more diversity in the applications we received,” said Rometty, who is expected to participate in Friday’s meeting.At the meeting, the workforce advisory board is also expected to announce details of a private-sector ad campaign led by Apple, IBM and the nonprofit Ad Council to promote alternate pathways to education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-wants-federal-hiring-to-focus-on-skills-over-degrees/story-gpEPdiLoYWFUquvSgzQXxH.html

26-06-2020||World||New world record set for single lightning flash stretching over 700 kms||A single lightning flash that stretched more than 700 kilometres across Brazil last year - equivalent to the distance between Boston and Washington DC - has created a new world record for the longest reported distance of lightning, the UN’s weather agency has announced.A World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) committee of experts said two new world records for the longest reported distance and the longest reported duration for a single lightning flash were set in Brazil and Argentina. The new records for extreme lightning bursts, or ‘megaflashes’, during 2019, are more than double the size and duration of the previous record flashes.A lightning flash that developed continuously over northern Argentina on March 4, 2019 lasted a whopping 16.73 seconds. A second flash stretched more than 700 kilometres (400 miles) across southern Brazil on October 31 last year. This was equivalent to the distance between Boston and Washington in the US, or between London and Basel in Switzerland.The previous megaflash distance record was 321 km (199.5 miles) in June 2007 across the US state of Oklahoma, and the previous continuous duration record was 7.74 seconds, reached in August 2012 in southern France.The new record-breaking strikes, captured by the American Geophysical Union ahead of International Lightning Safety Day on June 28, were recorded by equipment carried on the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellites, and their orbiting counterparts from Europe and China.The records were described by Professor Randall Cerveny, chief rapporteur of Weather and Climate Extremes for WMO, as “extraordinary.” “Environmental extremes are living measurements of what nature is capable of, as well as scientific progress in being able to make such assessments,” he said.“It is likely that even greater extremes still exist, and that we will be able to observe them as lightning detection technology improves.” Cerveny said the technology could help scientists better understand the whole science of lightning, and potentially save lives: “This will provide valuable information for establishing limits to the scale of lightning – including megaflashes – for engineering, safety and scientific concerns.” The WMO reiterated the dangers of lightning, and the many lives it claims every year. Lightning flashes have led to major loss of life. In 1975, 21 people in Zimbabwe were killed when a single flash hit the hut in which they were sheltering, and 469 people were killed in Dronka, Egypt in 1994, when lightning tragically struck a set of oil tanks, causing burning oil to flood the town.The official advice from the agency is to follow the 30-30 rule: if the time between flash and thunder is less than 30 seconds, stay inside, and wait 30 minutes after the last observed flash, to resume outdoor activities.Thunderstorms and lightning have wreaked havoc in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh over the past two days, claiming 110 lives, leaving at least 32 injured and causing widespread damage to property, officials in the two states said on Thursday.The lightning strikes were more devastating in Bihar, where 83 people have lost their lives since Wednesday, according to the figures released on Thursday by the Disaster Management Department in Patna.More than 20 people have been injured in these incidents and hospitalised, they said. Meanwhile, in Uttar Pradesh, at least 24 people died when they were struck by lightning on Thursday, while 12 were injured, officials said in Lucknow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-world-record-set-for-single-lightning-flash-stretching-over-700-kms/story-iIHHCTLJDU3srkjn4ljpOI.html

26-06-2020||World||London police to crackdown on illegal parties as officers attacked again||London police will crackdown on illegal street parties after officers came under attack for the second night running as they tried to disperse an unauthorised gathering, the capital’s police chief said on Friday.As Britain has begun to ease strict coronavirus lockdown rules, police have had to deal with a number of illegal parties and raves across the country with many people flouting guidelines that only groups of up to six can meet outdoors.  “It’s hot, some people have drunk far too much, some people are just angry and aggressive, and some are plain violent,” London police chief Cressida Dick said.The events were unlawful and should not be happening, she said, warning: “We will come and close them down.”On Wednesday night, 22 officers were hurt and a number of patrol cars were vandalised when trouble broke out at an unauthorised music event in Brixton, south London.Officers came under attack again on Thursday night from revellers throwing missiles in the Notting Hill area of west London, the scene of one of a number of unlicensed music events, “We’ve seen large numbers of people completely flouting the health regulations, seeming not to care at all about their own or their families’ health, wanting to have large parties,” Dick said.Police will be prepared for further trouble this weekend.“We know that having months of restrictions people have been frustrated and people will want to come together in gatherings but these illegal raves are obviously unacceptable,” Environment Secretary George Eustice told Sky News on Friday.This month, big protests by anti-racism supporters have taken place in central London and other cities in support of the Black Lives Matter movement and some counter-demonstrations, some of which have turned violent.About 140 officers had been injured in the last three weeks, Dick said. A spokesman for British Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the violence against the police appalling.On Thursday, authorities in Bournemouth, a beach town in southern England, declared a “major incident” over what they called the irresponsible behaviour of crowds who had ignored public health guidance on coronavirus and badly overstretched local services.Visitors arrived in large numbers in a spell of hot weather, resulting in gridlock on the roads, anti-social behaviour and alcohol-fuelled fights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/london-police-to-crackdown-on-illegal-parties-as-officers-attacked-again/story-7uUyosj2ASPkFYsXs9tmeN.html

The drug previously failed trials as an Ebola treatment.South Korea’s updated guidelines come after a study showed that the cheap and widely used dexamethasone reduced deaths in very sick Covid-19 patients. They advised doctors to take caution until a full study is published.“It seems appropriate to administer (dexamethasone), limited to severe cases with acute respiratory syndrome, as the doctor monitors the patient’s condition,” Kim Young-ok, director general of pharmaceutical safety bureau at the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, told a briefing on Friday.There was enough domestic supply of the dexamethasone, widely used since the 1960s, with the production of approximately 43 million tablets and 60 million injection ampoules a year, said Kim.Doctors in Europe will soon be able to treat patients with the drug after the health care regulator’s endorsement put it on track to become the first therapy for the disease on the continent.“An excessive use of dexamethasone can trigger different side effects as it tamps down the immune system along with inflammation, possibly leading to even cataract or glaucoma,” said Dr. Song Dae-sub, professor of pharmacy at Korea University.Korean health authorities also advised the dropping of hydroxychloroquine after a study found the decades-old malaria drug, which U.S. President Donald Trump touted a possible treatment, did not provide any benefit. There are currently no approved vaccines or treatments for the coronavirus, which has killed more than 488,467​ people globally, but about a dozen vaccines from more than 100 candidates globally are being tested on humans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-backs-remdesivir-for-covid-19-urges-caution-with-dexamethasone/story-kqa1PJYUfpYIXPNYWbG7DP.html

A vast majority of them are linked to the sprawling Xinfadi market in the city’s south that supplies about 80 percent of Beijing’s fresh produce and meat.The lockdown was eased on Tuesday for seven apartment blocks after residents tested negative for the virus, officials said at a Friday briefing. The remaining blocks are still in lockdown. Eleven new virus cases across Beijing were announced on Friday, bringing the total number of infections in the capital since the June 11 outbreak to 280. Food market workers and visitors, nearby residents, restaurant workers and delivery couriers have been the prime targets of mass testing so far as fears began to mount over the hygiene of Beijing’s food supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-eases-coronavirus-lockdown-as-mass-testing-gathers-pace/story-RXLI7RvwvMHT06SRHAmNNP.html

26-06-2020||World||Antibody tests may help detect Covid-19 infection if used at right time: Scientists||The timing of Covid-19 antibody test is critical to detect the infection in a patient, scientists have found in the most comprehensive review of the coronavirus testing to date. The researchers examined all available test accuracy evidence for antibody tests published up to the end of April.By combining data from many studies, they have shown that the tests are not accurate enough to confirm whether someone has the Covid-19 virus if used in the first two weeks after the symptoms appear.The researchers found that tests were only likely to be useful in detecting previous SARS-CoV-2 infection if used at least 14 days after the onset of symptoms, but say that studies show that the tests will miss 1 in 10 cases of Covid-19. However, they caution over reliance on this figure, as the studies were small, poorly reported and done in select patient groups.The researchers also fear accuracy will be lower when tests are used in the community, as the tests have mostly been evaluated in hospitalised patients – making it unclear whether they can detect lower antibody levels associated with milder and asymptomatic Covid-19 disease. Led by experts at the University of Birmingham, a group of researchers drawn from universities around the globe have published their findings in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews.“We’ve analysed all available data from around the world and discovered clear patterns telling is that timing is vital in using these tests. Use them at the wrong time and they don’t work,” said Jon Deeks, professor of Biostatistics and head of the Test Evaluation Research Group at the University of Birmingham.“There are promising tests, but there isn’t enough evidence to be able to identify the best tests yet, and we need to continue analysing data as it becomes available – particularly from non-clinical settings where individuals are displaying less severe symptoms, and following people over longer time periods,” Deeks said.The immune system of people who have Covid-19 responds to infection by developing cells that can attack the virus (antibodies) in their blood. Tests to detect antibodies in peoples’ blood could show whether they currently have COVID-19 or have had it previously. The body produces three classes of antibody - IgA, IgG and IgM. Most antibody tests measure both IgG and IgM, but some measure a single antibody or combinations of the three antibodies. Levels of antibodies rise and fall at different times after infection, with the IgG antibody usually highest a few weeks after infection. Some tests use venous blood and specialist laboratory equipment, whilst others use finger prick blood samples on disposable devices similar to pregnancy tests, which can be performed in laboratories, hospitals or at home. Researchers searched through over 11,000 publications on Covid-19 available at the end of April 2020, and identified 54 relevant studies from Asia, Europe, and the USA – that measured the accuracy of antibody tests used to detect current or past Covid-19 infection - whether in hospital or the community. In total these studies reported nearly 16,000 test results. “Accurate testing is vital – these tests may help identify Covid-19 in people who have had symptoms for two or more weeks but never had a swab test, and identifying how many have had the SARS-CoV-2 infection to assess disease spread and the need for public health interventions,” the researchers noted.“In time, we will learn whether having previously had the infection provides individuals with immunity to future infection, which will indicate the personal value of having this test,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/antibody-tests-may-help-detect-covid-19-infection-if-used-at-right-time-scientists/story-biGa4m0dWmaf7oOp0ISbcO.html
26-06-2020||World||Bhutan says flow of river waters to Assam disrupted by heavy rains||Bhutan on Friday said the supply of river water to Assam has been disrupted because irrigation channels have been affected by heavy monsoon rains, dismissing reports that the flow of water had been deliberately stopped.People familiar with developments in New Delhi said on condition of anonymity that the reports of Bhutan deliberately stopping the supply of water for irrigation in Assam were “not true”.“In fact, the Bhutanese side has categorically denied this, saying they have been carrying out repairs of channels to ensure the smooth flow of water to Assam,” said one of the people cited above.Some reports in the media, mainly in the northeastern states, had said Bhutan had stopped the flow of water through “dongs” or traditional irrigation channels. The reports had said thousands of farmers in Assam’s Baksa and Udalguri districts had been affected as they have been dependent on river water from Bhutan since the 1950s.Reacting to these reports, Bhutan’s foreign ministry said in a statement that authorities, especially in Samdrup Jongkhar district that borders Assam, were working “to ensure that the disruptions caused by the monsoon rains to the irrigation channels are addressed without delay” and water is available for farmers on the Indian side.“Bhutan would like to request for the understanding of the farmers in Assam as sometimes there could be few delays in the flow of water due to disruptions caused by the heavy monsoon rains and the operational difficulties arising from the restrictions put in place by both the countries due to Covid-19,” the statement added.The people cited above said all works along the border had earlier been affected by Bhutan’s strict Covid-19-related restrictions.Bhutan’s statement described allegations about the deliberate stopping of river water as “distressing” and the news reports “totally baseless”. It said there was “no reason why the flow of water should be stopped at this time”. It added that a deliberate attempt was made “by vested interests to spread misinformation and cause misunderstanding between the friendly people of Bhutan and Assam”. Since the lockdown in India and the closure of Bhutan’s borders due to the pandemic, Assamese farmers have been unable to enter Bhutan to maintain irrigation channels as was done in the past, the statement said.“However, understanding the difficulty that would be faced by the farmers in Assam, the Samdrup Jongkhar district officials and the general public have taken the initiative to repair the irrigation channels whenever there are problems to ensure the smooth flow of water to Assam,” it said. Heavy monsoon rains and a sudden rise in water levels, however, are posing serious challenges and Bhutanese authorities, equipped with heavy machinery, are on standby to clear blockages. Authorities in Samdrup Jongkhar are also in close contact with their counterparts in Baksa and Udalguri.“The people of Bhutan, especially those living along the borders of India, deeply value their age-old ties of friendship and cooperation with the people of India, particularly their close neighbours across the borders in Assam and West Bengal. The people of Bhutan feel that such ties of friendship, cooperation and support must continue and be reinforced during these difficult times,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-says-flow-of-river-waters-to-assam-disrupted-by-heavy-rains/story-ozBM7LM9bJjCVcHqwbUGrI.html
26-06-2020||World||World waking up to China’s true intentions to dominate 5G: US official||The world is waking up to China’s intentions to dominate the 5G telecommunications field amidst the coronavirus pandemic, unrest in Hong Kong, standoff with India and other efforts by Beijing to “conceal, coerce and co-opt the world,” a top American diplomat has said. Under Secretary of State for Economic Growth, Energy and the Environment Keith Krach told reporters that Huawei’s deals with the telecommunications operators around the world are evaporating because countries are only allowing trusted vendors of 5G networks. “It’s really giving the political will to government leaders around the world, and also to corporate leaders,” he said during a news conference on Thursday. “Following the pandemic, Hong Kong, skirmishes at the Indian border, and so many other efforts by Beijing to conceal, coerce, and co-opt the world, it’s waking up the citizens of the world to the Communist Party’s true intentions to dominate 5G. And Huawei’s efforts are running out of steam,” Krach said. In telecommunications, 5G is the fifth generation technology standard for cellular networks, the planned successor to the 4G networks which provide connectivity to most cellphones currently. Spanish multinational telecommunications company Telefónica states in its digital manifesto that security is paramount. Its CEO and chairman Jose Lopez this week declared that “Telefónica is proud to be a Clean Path company, and Telefónica in Spain and the UK are fully clean networks. Telefónica Deutschland and Brazil will be, in the near future, without equipment from any untrusted vendors,” he said. Just a few weeks ago, the big three telcos of Canada decided to partner with Ericsson and Nokia because Canadian public opinion was overwhelmingly against allowing Huawei into the 5G networks. The largest telco companies in major countries around the globe are also becoming “Clean Telcos”, Krach said. “In addition to Telefonica, we’ve seen this with Orange in France, Reliance in India, Telstra in Australia, SK and KT in Korea, Cosmote in Greece, NTT in Japan, and O2 in the United Kingdom,” Krach said, adding that the momentum in favour of securing 5G is building. The more countries, companies and citizens ask whom they should trust with the most sensitive data, the more obvious the answer becomes: not the Chinese Communist Party’s surveillance state, the US diplomat said. Krach said that the UK’s decision to reconsider the use of Huawei and its 5G networks resulted in a dramatic backlash from China. It threatened to punish the British bank HSBC, and pull investment from major British infrastructure projects. “Clearly, the Chinese Communist Party sees much more than mere financial benefit to having Huawei embedded in foreign 5G networks. I think it is no wonder why so many countries are reevaluating their partnerships with Chinese firms and standing up to the Chinese Communist Party’s aggression, like Australia,” he said. Earlier this year, Huawei boasted that it had 91 5G commercial contracts signed. That list has dwindled down to low double digits. Huawei’s deals have evaporated in direct proportion to the threats to retaliate against any country taking steps to protect its citizens and businesses’ most personal, sensitive information, Krach said. “For too long, Beijing bullied other countries and threatened retaliation if it did not get its way. China is a big marketplace, and consequences of retaliation are real. Just ask the people of Norway, who suffered economically for years after the committee that awards the Nobel Peace Prize – and they bestowed that prize on a democracy activist who questioned the Communist Party,” he told the reporters. Alleging that the bullying is out of desperation, perhaps fear, he said China is feeling its 5G dream of global domination suddenly slipping through its fingers. “We’ve all had experience with bullies in our lifetime, and if there is one thing we know about bullies, it’s that they back down when they’re confronted. And they really back down when your friends are standing by your side,” Krach added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-waking-up-to-china-s-true-intentions-to-dominate-5g-us-official/story-d7qmGFXjH3MzP8tUHdZSNL.html
26-06-2020||World||Tensions flare over Covid-hit ‘ghetto’ in southern Italy||Italy sent fresh riot police reinforcements Friday to a council estate in its south where a cluster of coronavirus cases among foreign farm workers has sparked tensions with locals.Some 700 people were placed in lockdown this week in the complex of five blocks of flats in Mondragone -- 60 kilometres north of Naples -- for 15 days, the region’s head Vincenzo De Luca said late Thursday.Local health authorities said 43 positive cases had been identified and tests were being carried out on all the residents.Four of the high-rise blocks house undocumented Bulgarian workers while Italian squatters occupy the fifth, De Luca said. The estate is “one of the thousands of ghettos in Italy, where we amass more or less undocumented foreigners to make them live in more or less heinous conditions,” said Corriere della Sera’s editorialist Goffredo Buccini.Fifty army soldiers were sent in to help secure the zone on Thursday after clashes between frustrated Bulgarians who wanted to return to work to earn money for food and angry locals who blamed them for spreading the virus.Hundreds of Bulgarians who came out to demonstrate Thursday were persuaded by police to return inside, but locals who learned they had left the Palazzi Cirio estate then turned up to hurl stones and trash cars, local media reported.Coronavirus tests were being offered to residents living near the estate and if 100 cases surfaced, the whole seaside town would be locked down, De Luca said.He said a few people with the virus had since slipped through the net and disappeared, but insisted surveillance of the estate would be 24 hours non stop from now on.Exploited “The Bulgarian workers... are part of the endless labour force working in the southern countryside without rights, often without contracts, without any security,” organised crime expert Roberto Saviano wrote in the Repubblica daily Friday.“It’s easy in this case to say that those spreading the disease are the foreigners, the invaders, the immigrants, the families of Bulgarian workers accused of going out to continue working,” he said.“But it would have happened the same if it had been Italian workers living in those working conditions, with those wages”.The estate was built decades ago as part of a project to transform Mondragone into the world Mozzarella capital, he said.Furious locals “seem to forget that those workers are essential to the countryside, that without them the (mozzarella-producing) buffaloes would drown in shit and neglect,” he added.It was not the only cluster of new cases in Italy, which lifted its lockdown at the start of June after three months of a pandemic which has officially killed over 34,600 people.At least 64 cases have emerged at a warehouse in Bologna used by express courier Bartolini, including 17 friends and relatives of workers.Italian media identified 10 cases of new clusters across the country this week, including in care homes in Como and Alessandria in the north, and a religious institute in Rome.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tensions-flare-over-covid-hit-ghetto-in-southern-italy/story-DiISV0n9vuaCJLicJEWgzI.html

On May 29, Pakistan recorded 2,429 cases, the lowest.According to the data released by the Ministry of National Health Services, 59 people died due to Covid-19 in the last 24 hours, taking the total number of fatalities to 3,962.So far 84,168 patients have recovered from the disease.Sindh has recorded maximum 75,168 patients followed by Punjab with 71,987, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 24,303, Islamabad 11,981, Balochistan 9,946, Gilgit-Baltistan 1,398 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 962 patients. So far, the authorities conducted 1,193,017 tests including 21,041 tests during the last 24 hours.Meanwhile, Pakistan sought the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) support to develop guidelines for the upcoming Eidul Azha when cattle markets are held across the country to sell animals for sacrifice.Special Assistant to Prime Minister on National Health Services Zafar Mirza during a meeting held on Thursday through video link with WHO Regional Director Dr Ahmed Al-Mandhari and his team asked for help to prepare guidelines.Mirza said Pakistan is fighting Covid-19 through a robust and coordinated national response.The purpose of the meeting was to discuss Pakistan’s response to the contagion and to explore areas where the WHO could provide technical guidance and support to help the country fight the virus.Prime Minister Imran Khan on Thursday defended his government’s handling of the coronavirus crisis, saying there has been no confusion or contradiction in the official policies since the start of the disease.“They say again and again that there was confusion ... if there was one country whose government did not have confusion, it was ours,” Khan said while addressing Parliament.He acknowledged about “a lot of pressure” exerted by the Cabinet colleagues to impose a strict lockdown but he refused to follow that path and even faced criticism for that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-records-lowest-single-day-spike-in-covid-19-cases-after-a-month/story-BTdGgKVasyxdm8v6DOZtDN.html
26-06-2020||World||‘Totally baseless’: Bhutan rejects reports on blocking irrigation water to Assam||Bhutan on Friday rejected media reports claiming that it has stopped the supply of irrigation water to farmers in Assam, terming them “totally baseless” and a “deliberate attempt” by vested interests to cause misunderstanding with India. In a statement, Bhutan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that since June 24, 2020, there have been several news articles published in India alleging that Bhutan has blocked water channels that supply irrigation water to Indian farmers in Baksa and Udalguri districts in Assam adjoining the country’s Samdrup Jongkhar district. “This is a distressing allegation and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs would like to clarify that the news articles are totally baseless as there is no reason why the flow of water should be stopped at this time,” it said.ALSO WATCH | ‘No dispute, Bhutan helping with clearing water blockage’: Assam Chief Secy  “It is a deliberate attempt by vested interests to spread misinformation and cause misunderstanding between the friendly people of Bhutan and Assam,” the ministry said. Bhutan’s statement came hours after Assam Chief Secretary Kumar Sanjay Krishna, in a late night tweet, termed the media reports as incorrect and said that the actual reason was natural blockage. “Recent media reports about Bhutan blocking water supply to India has been incorrectly reported. The actual reason being the natural blockage of informal irrigation channels into Indian fields! Bhutan has been actually helping to clear the blockage,” Krishna said. According to the statement issued on Facebook by Bhutan’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Assam’s Baksa and Udalguri districts have been benefitting from the water sources in Bhutan for many decades and “they continue to do so even during the present difficult times when we are faced with the COVID-19 pandemic”. The people of Bhutan, especially those living along the borders of India, “deeply value their age-old ties of friendship and cooperation with the people of India, particularly their close neighbors across the borders in Assam and West Bengal”, it said, adding that such ties of friendship, cooperation and support must continue and be reinforced during these difficult times. Since the lockdown in India and the closure of Bhutan’s borders due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Assamese farmers are unable to enter Bhutan to maintain the irrigation channels as was done in the past, it said. However, understanding the difficulty that would be faced by the farmers in Assam, the Samdrup Jongkhar district officials and the general public have taken the initiative to repair the irrigation channels whenever there are problems to ensure the smooth flow of water to Assam, it said. “The heavy monsoon rains and sudden rise in the water levels is posing serious challenges, but the Bhutanese authorities, including with heavy machinery, are on standby to clear any blockage and channel the water whenever there is a problem,” the statement said. Giving an assurance to the people of Assam, the ministry said that the Royal Government of Bhutan, particularly the Samdrup Jongkhar district authorities, will make every effort to ensure that the disruptions caused by the monsoon rains to the irrigation channels are addressed without delay and there is water available for the farmers in Assam. “Bhutan would like to request for the understanding of the farmers in Assam as sometimes there could be few delays in the flow of water due to disruptions caused by the heavy monsoon rains and the operational difficulties arising from the restrictions put in place by both the countries due to COVID-19,” it said. The Samdrup Jongkhar authorities maintain close contact with their counterparts in Baksa and Udalguri, the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/totally-baseless-bhutan-rejects-reports-on-blocking-irrigation-water-to-assam/story-sHmcUFjKBBwl1Zde2Hfk8I.html
26-06-2020||World||Germany weighs measures against US over Nord Stream threat||Germany is preparing to strike back against the US if President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to kill off the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline with additional sanctions.Chancellor Angela Merkel’s administration is considering pressing for coordinated European Union action, according to two German officials familiar with the discussions. An economy ministry paper seen by Bloomberg News said such measures by the US would be new and could hit significantly more German and European companies and banks as well as state agencies.The 1,200-kilometer (745 mile) pipeline under the Baltic Sea, designed to pump Russian gas directly to Germany, has triggered deep division between EU member states. But the prospect of a direct US intervention in the 27-member bloc’s energy interests should prompt a collective response, said the officials, who asked not to be identified.The new German strategy adds the possibility of further escalation between the transatlantic allies, with the US this week announcing potential tariffs on $3.1 billion of products from Germany and other European countries. Trump has also reiterated his intention to cut the number of US troops in Germany and renewed a threat to hit the German auto industry with a new set of levies.Flashpoints between the two sides are multiplying as Trump’s reelection campaign runs into trouble and the Covid-19 pandemic threatens to get out of control in the USOn Friday, EU diplomats are holding talks over whether to maintain a ban on US travelers when external border controls begin to lift last week. The officials are aiming to draw up a list of which countries’ nationals will be allowed in and may use infection rates as one of their criteria, which would potentially see the US excluded.In a Twitter post, German Health Minister Jens Spahn pointed to new infections in the US as a sign that the pandemic has yet to peak.The Europeans though are trying to ease the friction over digital taxes after the US pulled out of talks aimed at finding a global agreement on how to tax internet giants like Facebook Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. In a letter to US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin seen by Bloomberg News, France, the U.K., Italy and Spain offered to initially limit the tax to automated digital services like search and social media, while excluding retailers like Amazon.Trump has been ramping up his attacks on Germany since Merkel helped to derail his plans for a Group of Seven summit at Camp David this month and Nord Stream, owned by Gazprom PJSC, is a longstanding target. He told a rally last week in Tulsa, Oklahoma that Germany is “delinquent” on defense spending and dispatching “billions” to Vladimir Putin.“We’re supposed to protect Germany from Russia, but Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for energy coming from a pipeline,” Trump said. “Excuse me, how does that work?”US sanctions signed by Trump that targeted pipe-laying vessels in December threw the pipeline’s completion into disarray. While German officials said the project would merely by delayed, new measures proposed by US senators could put Nord Stream in permanent danger, the German officials said.But any response, including sanctions, would have to be weighed carefully, one official said. With Trump’s poll numbers sagging four months ahead of the US presidential election, he could follow through on previous tariff threats -- notably on German autos, the official said.German Economy Minister Peter Altmaier issued a warning over the legality of the new measures earlier this month, signaling that imposing them could bring a new low to transatlantic relations.“The German government has long had the view that sanctions with extraterritorial effects are in conflict with international law and that they’re not a contribution to advancing international cooperation,” Altmaier told reporters in Berlin on June 12. “This position hasn’t changed.”Bundestag lawmakers on the economic affairs committee discussed potential retaliation in a June 17 meeting. The committee chairman, Klaus Ernst of the anti-capitalist Left Party, said parties were in agreement that such measures violated international law.“The government is called upon to develop and put forward proposals for a measured, clear reaction on behalf of Germany and the European Union,” Ernst said in a statement after the closed-door meeting.Pipeline TimingGerman industry is concerned that the new raft of sanctions may prompt counter sanctions in Europe, which it opposes on the strength of US-EU trade ties and traditional allegiances, Michael Harms, the managing director of the BDI lobby’s East European Committee, told reporters last week. Some 670 companies from 25 nations have worked on the pipeline, according to Harms.Gazprom, which has vessels docked off Germany’s Baltic coast, is set on completing the pipeline in the face of US resistance. It made a request with authorities in Copenhagen to operate so-called DP3-class vessels in Danish waters.The Akademik Cherskiy, a vessel that Russia could use to build the remaining stretch of the gas-export link, arrived at a German Baltic port last month after a two-month voyage from the Sea of Japan.The German ministry paper said it was unclear how the Russians planned to proceed with some 150 kilometers remaining for the pipeline but it would need to resume work this summer to complete the work by early 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-weighs-measures-against-us-over-nord-stream-threat/story-gRaY1EBYqMV5t4PRf2jEpK.html

26-06-2020||World||Chinese ambassador in United States secretly recruited scientists, says FBI||Chinese Ambassador in Washington and a Chinese diplomat in New York city secretly aided in the recruitment of scientists in the United States, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI).An affidavit, filed in federal court last year and unsealed in April, gives a deeper look into China’s tactics, Washington Examiner reported. US officials have often expressed concern about Beijing’s espionage capabilities.According to Examiner, the affidavit was first reported by the Daily Beast on Monday and the word ‘China’ is almost entirely redacted from the court filing, though it does appear at least once.An FBI agent who specializes in counterintelligence wrote in the affidavit that the FBI was investigating a scientist in Connecticut who was “knowingly and willfully working in the United States on behalf of government-controlled and government-directed entities for the purpose of recruiting high-level molecular genetics and stem cell stem cell researchers to work at state-controlled universities and laboratories in [China], and for the purpose of acquiring and transferring to those state-controlled universities and laboratories, cutting-edge molecular genetics and stem-cell research and technology developed at leading academic and private-sector research platforms in the United States.”The FBI further pointed out that “those efforts are undertaken ... with the [Chinese] government’s publicly-declared national security objectives of technology transfer and human capital acquisition.”The scientist, whose name was redacted in court documents, became a naturalized US citizen in November 2009 and spent years working in genetic research in America, most recently at a redacted school determined to be Yale University, which told the FBI it had no policy requiring researchers or professors to disclose their involvement with outside entities. The school did not respond to the Washington Examiner’s request for comment.The scientist is now believed to be working at Southern Medical University in China.The Homeland Security Department determined that between October 2017 and October 2018, the scientist spent 300 days outside the US. The FBI affidavit suggested that the professor was associated with China’s Thousand Talents Program, revealing he was associated with efforts to recruit other scientists to share their research with or to work in China.The unredacted version of the affidavit does not name Cui Tiankai, who has been ambassador to the US since 2013, or the diplomat in New York City.The Chinese Embassy denied that its diplomats in the US aided in the recruitment of scientists.“The allegation is nothing but malicious fabrication,” spokeswoman Fang Hong said in a statement to the Washington Examiner.The Justice Department began the China Initiative in 2018 to combat the espionage threat, and the US has arrested and charged a number of scientists who have participated in the Thousand Talents Program.At least 54 scientists have lost their jobs over a failure to disclose financial ties to foreign governments, the National Institutes of Health said earlier this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-ambassador-in-united-states-secretly-recruited-scientists-says-fbi/story-9tPiteQPeUxD3H74R2FTMK.html
26-06-2020||World||Trump administration asks Supreme Court to axe Obamacare||President Donald Trump’s administration late on Thursday asked the US Supreme Court to invalidate the law dubbed Obamacare that, introduced by predecessor, added millions of Americans to the country’s healthcare safety net.The Affordable Care Act (ACA) became invalid after the previous, Republican-led, US Congress axed parts of it, government advocate Noel Francisco argued in a filing to the court.“Nothing the 2017 Congress did demonstrates it would have intended the rest of the ACA to continue to operate in the absence of these three integral provisions,” Francisco said.The Trump administration signalled earlier in the day that it would asked the court to declare the ACA illegal, setting up what is likely to be a key political battleground in this year’s presidential election.The Democratic House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi earlier described the move as “unfathomable cruelty” amid the coronavirus outbreak, which has hit the United States harder than any other country.It was the ACA that has prohibited health insurers from denying coverage to Americans with pre-existing health conditions.Trump has criticized healthcare costs and coverage under Obamacare and has been promising since his 2016 campaign to replace it with a different plan.Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden called the bid to overturn the law “cruel, heartless (and) callous”.Democrats expect to make their promise to defend Obamacare a marquee election-year issue after they used a similar strategy in 2018 to win control of the House of Representatives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-asks-supreme-court-to-axe-obamacare/story-Mpt9xLgDQGVNL1Xu8MiKOO.html
26-06-2020||World||Multilateral structures like UNSC have teeth but show little or no appetite to bite: UN chief||Multilateral instruments such as the UN Security Council have teeth but “show little or no appetite to bite,” UN chief Antonio Guterres has said as he underlined the need for “effective and inclusive” multilateralism. As the world body on Friday commemorates the 75th anniversary of the adoption of the UN Charter, the founding document of the Organisation, the Secretary General said there is a need to re-imagine the way nations cooperate. “We need a networked multilateralism, bringing together the UN system, regional organisations, international financial institutions and others. And we need an inclusive multilateralism, drawing on the indispensable contributions of civil society, business, cities, regions and, in particular, with greater weight given to the voices of youth,” Guterres said at a virtual press conference Thursday. Underling that in the 21st century, governments are no longer the only political and power reality, he said “we need an effective multilateralism that can function as an instrument of global governance where it is needed.” He pointed out that the problem is not that multilateralism is not up to the challenges the world faces. “The problem is that today’s multilateralism lacks scale, ambition and teeth. And some of the instruments that do have teeth, show little or no appetite to bite, as has recently been the case with the difficulties faced by the Security Council,” he said. Guterres underscored that the international community must give multilateralism the capacities to confront current challenges, not only to meet immediate needs, but to enable future generations to meet theirs. The UNSC has been strongly criticised for its inaction and lack of leadership in dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic and its failure to adopt even a single resolution on the global health and humanitarian crisis caused by the outbreak. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has called for reformed multilateralism and reform of multilateral system as essential to ensure that the international system is inclusive and caters to requirements of all countries, which will in turn facilitate stronger action. Reforming multilateral systems is one of the five key priorities for India when it sits in the Council as a non-permanent member for two years beginning January 2021. India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti has said that as the UN commemorates its 75th anniversary this year, “it is clear to us that United Nations and indeed multilateralism itself need to change to reflect contemporary realities to enable them to remain effective and credible.” Guterres acknowledged that it is difficult to have a meaningful transformation of the mechanisms of global governance without the active participation of the world powers. “Let me blunt, their relationships today have never been more dysfunctional. But I firmly believe that an awakening will come when we recognise our shared fragilities - when the factors that today divide instead begin to force people to finally understand that division is a danger to everyone, starting with themselves,” he said. He said he looks forward to discussing these matters with world leaders during the high-level UN General Assembly session in September in whatever format necessary. “We absolutely must come together to reimagine and reinvent the world we share. In response to questions, the UN chief said while many negative things have happened in the 75 years since the UN founded, “at least the Third World War so many people have predicted was avoided. We had what many called the ‘long peace’ with many small conflicts, but conflicts in which the big powers did not get involved against each other.” While the high-level UNGA week looks all set to be held virtually this year due to Covid-19, Guterres said he hopes that a summit of China, France, Russia, UK and the US - the five permanent members of the Security Council - will be possible before the General Assembly. “It will be very important to address some of the contradictions that still, to a large extent, paralyse very important issues in the Security Council,” he said. The UN chief said he wishes that through the summit, the big powers will understand independently of what divides them, that they need to come together and mobilise the world to defeat the pandemic, defeat climate change, put some order in relation to the cyberspace and create conditions for recovery to a more sustainable and inclusive economy and society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/multilateral-structures-like-unsc-have-teeth-but-show-little-or-no-appetite-to-bite-un-chief/story-hliS7bWks3pdzUn4mBqvNI.html
26-06-2020||World||Crowds at UK beaches stir Covid-19 concern and govt warning||Summer heat saw crowds of daytrippers descend on UK coastal resorts, leading one southern town to declare a major incident and Health Secretary Matt Hancock to warn that he could close beaches to head off any potential new round of coronavirus cases.Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole Council said emergency services had been overstretched after thousands of people flocked to Bournemouth’s beaches, gridlocking roads. Images posted on social media Thursday showed crowds filling the coastal town to enjoy the hottest day of the year so far.Hancock later told TalkRadio that while he’s “reluctant” to close the beaches, the government has that authority. “We do have those powers, and if we see a spike in the number of cases, then we will take action,” he said. “The virus doesn’t respect the fact that it’s a hot summer’s day. The virus spreads from social contact.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been gradually easing lockdown restrictions, and earlier this week announced that pubs and restaurants will be able to reopen July 4. He also said social distancing rules will be eased, allowing people to come within a meter of those from other households, so long as they take other precautions, such as wearing a face mask.But until July 4, the requirement remains to stay 2 meters apart, something photos on Twitter suggested wasn’t being observed on Bournemouth’s beaches.Covid WarningChief Secretary to the Treasury Steve Barclay, a member of Johnson’s government, said on BBC TV’s “Question Time” program that the scenes from the coastal resort were “very disappointing,” and he urged people to show “common sense” and stay 2 meters apart. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty also showed his concern, warning that cases of the virus may tick upwards again.“COVID-19 has gone down due to the efforts of everyone but is still in general circulation,” Whitty said. “If we do not follow social distancing guidance, then cases will rise again. Naturally people will want to enjoy the sun, but we need to do so in a way that is safe for all.”Over the past two days, Bournemouth council has collected 41 tons of waste from its beaches, according to a statement on its website. Additional police patrols were brought in and overnight campers were evicted, it said.“We are absolutely appalled at the scenes witnessed on our beaches,” Council Leader Vikki Slade said in the statement. “The irresponsible behavior and actions of so many people is just shocking, and our services are stretched to the absolute hilt trying to keep everyone safe. We have had no choice now but to declare a major incident and initiate an emergency response.”RecoveryNationwide, still more than 1,000 people a day are testing positive for the virus, and the latest daily figures showed 149 deaths Wednesday.Even so, the government’ focus is shifting to getting the economy moving again after the three-month lockdown plunged the economy into recession and left the state paying the wages of almost 12 million private-sector jobs.Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak “will give a statement in July which will be all about the next phase, talking about how we green the economy, how we respond with the infrastructure projects,” Barclay, the No. 2 at the Treasury, told “Question Time.”“Jobs, particularly for young people, is one of the key challenges before us, and that’s very much what we’re focused on in the Treasury at the moment,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crowds-at-uk-beaches-stir-covid-19-concern-and-govt-warning/story-G0WS7pAww4QWVERIhrjeXP.html
26-06-2020||World||Trump zeroes in on base to overcome reelection obstacles||President Donald Trump is sharpening his focus on his most ardent base of supporters as concern grows inside his campaign that his standing in the battleground states that will decide the 2020 election is slipping.Trump turned his attention this week to “left wing mobs” toppling Confederate monuments and visited the nation’s southern border to spotlight progress on his 2016 campaign promise to build a US-Mexico border wall.He ignored public health experts warning Americans to avoid large gatherings by holding two large campaign events in Oklahoma and Arizona, parts of the country where coronavirus infections are surging.With his rhetorical turn, Trump is feeding red meat issues to a base that helped spur his upset victory over Hillary Clinton in 2016. But he risks appearing to ignore larger issues that are jolting the country, like the pandemic and racial injustice, while underplaying economic issues, even though polling shows that to be an area where Trump performs relatively well.“This might be the only path for him at this point,” said Dan Schnur, who served as a campaign adviser to Arizona Sen. John McCain and California Gov. Pete Wilson. “Most of the center is no longer available to him. Motivating his base is not just his best available strategy. It might be the only one.”The president’s advisers believe there are few undecideds when it comes to Trump, with only a sliver of voters who may change their mind and warm to him. The more effective use of resources is to make sure those who like him turn out to vote, according to campaign and White House officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal strategy.Trump takes a measure of comfort in the fact that he found himself in a similar position in 2016. Polls throughout his race against Clinton showed him with a deficit, often just as wide as some polls now suggest, before he closed that gap in the final days of the campaign as the base coalesced around him.As he did with Clinton, Trump has tried to drive up Democratic rival Joe Biden’s negatives, pushing unsubstantiated claims about his mental acuity and his son Hunter’s business dealings. But Trump so far has had little success in driving Biden into the deeply negative territory where Clinton found herself.Biden’s campaign is confident that the circumstances for Trump, who now has a well-established political record, have complicated his ability to drag down his opponent with a barrage of attacks.“The reality is this is a different election than 2016 was,” said Symone Sanders, a senior adviser to the Biden campaign. “In 2016, a lot of voters went to the polls asking what kind of president Trump would be. It’s no longer a theory of what kind of president Donald Trump will be.”Trump hopes to get as much of that base to turn out while persuading the voters who have shown tepid enthusiasm for Biden to stay home. Indeed, while many national and battleground polls show Trump trailing Biden, surveys have suggested that some of the former vice president’s support is lukewarm.Trump’s team feels confident that approximately 40% of the electorate supports him and notes his approval rating has remained unusually stable during his term. The president’s campaign advisers believe it comes down to getting a bigger proportion of the smaller group of people who love Trump to turn out than the larger group of voters who express tepid support for Biden.With that in mind, the campaign has renewed its focus on plays to please the base. Among them: the border wall and other hard-line immigration executive orders; a promise to produce a list of conservative Supreme Court nominees; public consideration of acknowledging Israel’s annexation of parts of the West Bank to satisfy evangelicals; and, most strikingly, a focus on reopening the nation’s economy over publicly dwelling on the pandemic.South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, one of Trump’s closest allies in Congress, said Trump can win with “a little more message discipline” and a focus on policies that separate him and Biden.“Just make it more about policy and less about your personality,” Graham told reporters.Last weekend, Trump held a big-arena rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, that drew a relatively sparse crowd for a president who is used to overflow audiences. He then took part on Tuesday in a jam-packed event at a Phoenix megachurch — albeit in a smaller venue — for young conservatives. Both are the sort of events that Trump is counting on helping him turn the tide.“Nov. 3 is a big day,” Trump told attendees at a Students for Trump event in Phoenix. “Get out. Get the parents, get the friends, get the husband, get the wife, get everybody.”Arizona has emerged as a growing hot spot for the virus, and Phoenix’s Democratic mayor, Kate Gallego, implored that such an event — most participants declined to wear masks and didn’t practice social distancing — could not be safely carried out.Karen Kedrowski, a political scientist at Iowa State University, said such events help Trump echo ardent conservatives’ frustrations that the lockdown has lasted too long. But Trump’s attempt to amplify his message through mass gatherings is perilous.“The president sees the need to electrify his base,” Kedrowski said. “But what happens to the president if two weeks from now rally attendees are becoming sick and spreading the virus in their communities?”During the event, Trump, who had stirred up controversy by using the racist phrase “kung flu” to describe COVID-19, was reflecting on the many names he’s heard the coronavirus called.When he heard the pejorative yelled from the crowd, Trump smiled and said it, too. The audience roared in approval.Biden surrogates, including vice presidential contender Sen. Tammy Duckworth, called out Trump for it. Still, Biden is being careful not to get dragged into a culture war.“We have not let Donald Trump’s antics distract us from our message,” Sanders said. “At the same time, we’re not going to sit back and allow him to disparage large swaths of the electorate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-zeroes-in-on-base-to-overcome-reelection-obstacles/story-2qTDaI1XOP9NPMV62iapGK.html
26-06-2020||World||Protesters raise demand to remove statues of slave kneeling before Lincoln||Calls are intensifying for the removal of twin Emancipation memorials in Washington, DC, and Boston that depict a freed slave kneeling at Abraham Lincoln’s feet — optics that jar and offend many in a nation confronting racial injustice through a fresh lens.The Emancipation Memorial, also known as the Emancipation Group and the Freedman’s Memorial, was erected in Washington’s Lincoln Park in 1876. Three years later, a copy was installed in Boston, home to the statue’s white creator, Thomas Ball.Protesters gathered earlier this week to demand the removal of the original in Washington, where the Army activated about 400 unarmed National Guard personnel ahead of calls circulating on social media to tear it down Thursday evening.And in Boston, where a petition is circulating for the copy to be taken down, the city’s arts commission is holding public hearings Thursday and next Tuesday to discuss its fate.What originally was intended in 1876 to celebrate liberation, critics contend, looks more like subservience and supremacy in 2020.“I’ve been watching this man on his knees since I was a kid,” said Tory Bullock, a Black actor and activist leading the campaign to get the Boston memorial removed.“It’s supposed to represent freedom but instead represents us still beneath someone else. I would always ask myself, “If he’s free, why is he still on his knees?’” Bullock said.The memorial has been on Boston’s radar at least since 2018, when it launched a comprehensive review of whether public sculptures, monuments and other artworks reflected the city’s diversity and didn’t offend communities of color. The Boston Art Commission said it was paying extra attention to works with “problematic histories.”Black donors paid for the original in Washington; white politician and circus showman Moses Kimball financed the copy on a downtown square a block away from Boston Common. The inscription on both reads: “A race set free and the country at peace. Lincoln rests from his labors.”But Blacks weren’t part of the design process, and the memorial’s central visual takeaway — a Black man with broken shackles kneeling before his white savior, with a whipping post and chains in the background — has had people cringing for years.“How can you say you care about Black lives and then leave a statue up for decades that actually promotes a disgusting and demeaning image of those very lives?” asked Lilian McCarthy, among more than 12,000 people who signed Bullock’s petition.Similar scorn has dogged the original in Washington since it was unveiled. At its dedication nearly a century and a half ago, abolitionist and Black statesman Frederick Douglass spoke critically of the freed slave’s depiction as kneeling before Lincoln.President Donald Trump told Fox News’ Sean Hannity on Thursday, “I can see controversy but I can also see beauty” in the Emancipation Memorial in Washington. Trump suggested that activists who want to see certain memorials removed should petition government.“You know, we can take things down, too,” Trump said. “I can understand certain things being taken down. But they ought to go through a process, legally. And then we take it down, in some cases put ’em in museums or wherever they may go.”But Eleanor Holmes Norton, the District’s non-voting delegate in the U.S. House, said the monument ignores the fact that Black Americans played a pivotal role in securing their own freedom.“Blacks too fought to end enslavement,” Norton tweeted this week, saying she was introducing a bill to move the statue to a museum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-raise-demand-to-remove-statues-of-slave-kneeling-before-lincoln/story-KMxc8hUtryMKkgZWNZyDmO.html
26-06-2020||World||No reason for any country to include coal in Covid-19 recovery plans: UN Chief||A week after India launched the auction process for coal blocks for commercial mining, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres has said there is no reason for any country to include coal in their Covid-19 recovery plans and investments should instead be made in non-polluting energy sources. Guterres on Thursday presented the United Nations Response on Covid-19 that documents not only the action taken by the world body over the last three months of the pandemic, but also offers a roadmap toward recovering better. “We cannot go back to the way it was and simply recreate the systems that have aggravated the crisis. We need to build back better with more sustainable, inclusive, gender-equal societies and economies,” Guterres said in remarks during a virtual press conference. “There is no good reason, for example, for any country to include coal in their Covid-19 recovery plans. This is the time to invest in energy sources that don’t pollute, don’t cause emissions, generate decent jobs and save money,” the UN Chief said, adding that the United Nations is strongly committed to leading the renewal. While Guterres did not name any country, sources in the UN said the remark was in reference to the decision by India to launch the auction process for coal blocks for commercial mining. India’s decision raises concern as other countries could also use coal to meet energy requirements as economies come out a Covid-19 lockdown, they said. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had last week launched the auction process for 41 coal blocks for commercial mining, a move that opens India’s coal sector for private players, and termed it a major step in the direction of India achieving self-reliance. Launching the auction of mines for commercial mining, that is expected to garner Rs 33,000 crore of capital investment in the country over next five to seven years, the prime minister had said India will win the coronavirus war and turn the crisis into an opportunity, and that the pandemic will make India self-reliant. Presently, despite being the world’s fourth largest producer, India is the second largest importer of the dry-fuel, Modi had said. “Allowing private sector in commercial coal mining is unlocking resources of a nation with the world’s fourth-largest reserves,” he had pointed out. He had said that the launch of the auction process not only marked the beginning of unlocking of the country’s coal sector from the lockdown of decades, but aimed at making India the largest exporter of coal. The commencement of auction process of these blocks is part of the series of announcements made under ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan’ or self-reliant India Mission to revive the Indian economy impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. In Bangkok last November, Guterres had stressed on the need to stop the creation of new power plants based on coal in the future, adding that there are still several new coal power plants for electricity production foreseen in the future in East Asia, in Southeast Asia and in South Asia. “There is an addiction to coal that we need to overcome because it remains a major threat in relation to climate change,” he had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-reason-for-any-country-to-include-coal-in-covid-19-recovery-plans-un-chief/story-0PoyndfB8UO4g4gIvyDRRL.html

26-06-2020||World||Religious, ethnic minorities highly vulnerable to trafficking in Pakistan: US report||Asserting that Pakistan did not demonstrate overall increasing efforts to eliminate human trafficking, the United States has downgraded Islamabad to the ‘Tier 2 Watch List’ on the country trafficking scale. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Thursday released the US State Department Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report for the year 2020. The report stated that religious minorities and children in Pakistan are highly vulnerable to trafficking. The report also highlighted that terrorist groups in Pakistan kidnap children as young as 12 and force them to spy, fight and conduct suicide attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan.“Pakistan is a destination country for men, women, and children subjected to forced labour--particularly from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Sri Lanka. Refugees and stateless persons from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Burma, as well as religious and ethnic minorities such as Christians and Hazaras, are particularly vulnerable to traffickers in Pakistan,” the report read. “Non-state militant groups kidnap children as young as 12, buy them from destitute parents, coerce parents with threats or fraudulent promises into giving their children away, or recruit children from madrassas; these armed groups force children to spy, fight, and conduct suicide attacks in Pakistan and Afghanistan. Traffickers have promised Pakistani boys admittance to Afghan religious schools but sold them to members of the Afghan security forces for bacha bazi,” the report added. The report acknowledged that the Pakistan government does not fully meet the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking but is making significant efforts to do so.“Unlike the previous reporting period, the government did not take action against credible reports of official complicity in trafficking, and organizations reported official complicity and corruption led to several high-profile trafficking cases being dropped during the year. The government continued to lack overall adequate resources for victim care, and only referred four per cent of all victims identified to care. Therefore Pakistan was downgraded to Tier 2 Watch List,” the report noted.‘Tier 2 Watch List’ is a category denoting a country those meriting special scrutiny, on the grounds that it had failed to enact legislation to fully criminalize trafficking. The report highlighted that the Pakistan government did not report any efforts to address local government officials’ reportedly “endemic perpetuation of bonded labour, which created a culture of impunity for offenders”.“Feudal landlords and brick kiln owners used their political connections to facilitate their use of forced labour. In some cases, when bonded labourers attempted to escape or seek legal redress, police refused to file a case and returned bonded labourers to their traffickers,” the report stated. The report said that Labour inspectors, who are front-line officials to inspect and identify forced and bonded labour, had inadequate training to identify indicators of trafficking, insufficient funding to conduct inspections, and a lack of standard procedures to refer potential forced and bonded labour cases to police.“Despite high incidences of child and forced labour in agriculture and domestic work, the majority of provincial labour laws did not allow labour inspectors to inspect these worksites for infractions,” the report read.Trafficking in Persons (TIP) report sorts countries into four tiers -- Tier-1, Tier-2, Tier-2 watchlist, and Tier-3-- based on their efforts to fight trafficking. Countries whose governments fully meet the TVPA’s (Trafficking Victims Protection Act) minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking are categorised as Tier-1.Those countries whose governments do not fully meet the TVPA’s minimum standards but are making significant efforts to bring themselves into compliance with those standards are put under Tier-2.Pompeo said that the US denied “certain kinds of assistance” to countries that were ranked in the Tier-3 category.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/religious-ethnic-minorities-highly-vulnerable-to-trafficking-in-pakistan-report/story-iWCb7570AblWpDl8W5OtcP.html

26-06-2020||World||Israel and UAE to announce partnership to combat Covid: Israeli PM Netanyahu||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Thursday that his government and the United Arab Emirates will soon announce a partnership in the fight against the coronavirus.The deal, which the UAE later said involved two private companies, comes despite recent warnings from UAE officials that Israel’s planned annexation of parts of the occupied West Bank would harm its efforts to improve relations with Arab states.In a speech to graduating Israeli fighter pilots, Netanyahu said an announcement was expected “in a few moments” and came after months of “intense contacts.” “This collaboration will be in the fields of research and development, technology, in areas that will improve the confidence in health throughout the region,” he said.The Emirates’ state-run WAM news agency later published an item acknowledging two private firms signed a deal with two Israeli companies “to develop research and technology to fight Covid-19,” the illness caused by the coronavirus. The announcement did not name the firms.“As a result of the pandemic’s spread worldwide, it is imperative to place the protection of humanity at the forefront of global action to overcome this unprecedented crisis,” WAM said.It’s unclear what that research will involve. The UAE has been working closely with China on the virus.Israel and the UAE, home to Dubai and Abu Dhabi, do not have formal diplomatic relations, but they are believed to maintain close behind-the-scenes contacts because of their shared concerns about Iran.Earlier this month, the UAE’s ambassador to the United States published an op-ed in an Israeli newspaper confirming that ties had improved but warning Israel that proceeding with annexation would “upend” any efforts to normalise relations with Arab states.“Annexation will certainly and immediately upend Israeli aspirations for improved security, economic and cultural ties with the Arab world and with UAE,” Ambassador Yousef al-Otaiba wrote.However, last week, another leading UAE official said it was open to cooperating with Israel on efforts to combat the coronavirus and other humanitarian issues despite the political disagreement over annexation.“Can I have a political disagreement with Israel but at the same time try and bridge other areas of the relationship? I think I can,” Anwar Gargash, the UAE’s minister of state for foreign affairs, said in an interview with the American Jewish Committee advocacy group.Last month, the UAE sent a cargo plane to Israel loaded with coronavirus-related aid it said was destined for the Palestinians. The Palestinian Authority said it could not receive the aid because there had been no prior coordination.Netanyahu has vowed to annex all of Israel’s far-flung settlements and the strategic Jordan Valley, which together amount to around 30% of the occupied West Bank. President Donald Trump’s Middle East plan endorsed the move, which has been rejected by the Palestinians and much of the international community.Israel could begin the annexation process as soon as July 1, but the Trump administration may apply the brakes in an effort to revive peace negotiations. The UAE is a close and influential US military ally.Opponents of annexation say it would make it virtually impossible to create a viable Palestinian state in the West Bank, east Jerusalem and Gaza, territories seized by Israel in the 1967 war. A two-state solution is still widely seen as the only way of resolving the conflict.Netanyahu has boasted of quietly improving ties with Arab states, but full normalisation still appears unlikely without a resolution of the conflict with the Palestinians.Jordan and Egypt are the only two Arab countries to have made peace with Israel. Jordan, another close US ally, is staunchly opposed to any annexation, saying it would cause a “massive conflict.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-and-uae-to-announce-partnership-to-combat-covid-israeli-pm-netanyahu/story-c1fNnKtpInmYTmWItgH9mN.html
26-06-2020||World||Lawmaker slams Trump for donating ventilators to select countries||A top Democratic Senator has alleged that the Trump administration’s expenditure of more than USD200 million to donate ventilators during Covid-19 pandemic is allegedly favouring countries personally selected by the US President. Among the countries that have been provided the life-saving machines are Russia, India, and South Africa, said Senator Robert Menendez, Ranking Member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. “Given the scale and nature of the current (Covid-19) crisis, it is imperative that we ensure the effective use of US aid dollars,” he wrote in a letter to Donald Trump, citing the administration’s suspect decision to waive congressional notification requirements for sending the ventilators during the pandemic. “Providing ventilators to countries that need them is critical, but, as with any assistance, must be done in a productive and transparent manner. To that end, the National Security Council (NSC), in cooperation with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), must ensure greater transparency and accountability around the provision of ventilators,” he said. Menendez alleged that without a fulsome explanation for USAID’s procurement and provision of ventilators to a select group of countries, Trump’s orders to ship more than 7,500 ventilators abroad, to just 40 countries, exemplifies the potential transactional politicisation of US foreign assistance and risks further tarnishing USAID’s reputation as an apolitical aid agency. Reiterating his concerns in a separate letter to USAID Acting Administrator John Barsa, Menendez called for further transparency regarding the respective roles of USAID and the NSC in the distribution decision-making process and the US government’s efforts to ensure that Covid patients abroad have equitable access to life-saving ventilators.To date, USAID has submitted two Congressional Notifications (CN) outlining the Administration’s plans to spend approximately USD 202 million in Global Health Program, Emergency Reserve Funds and Economic Support Funds, provided by the CARES Act, to purchase 7,582 ventilators to distribute to up to 40 countries, Menendez to Acting Administratior Barsa. “While the notifications provide some details, I am concerned that the NSC’s influence on these decisions both circumvents longstanding USAID procurement and accountability policies and interjects political agendas into how USAID allocates it Global Health and Emergency Reserve Fund resources,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lawmaker-slams-trump-for-donating-ventilators-to-select-countries/story-SuUwbEXQApThNm3bDnT08I.html
26-06-2020||World||China used Covid-19 to lash out in every direction: US Senator||Stating that China continues its premeditated military incursion along the border with India, a top American Senator has alleged that Beijing has used the Covid-19 pandemic to lash out in every direction. “China in particular has used the pandemic to lash out in every direction. They’ve antagonized and harassed Taiwanese, Malaysian, Vietnamese, and Indonesian vessels in the South China Sea; and used every tool in their shed to coerce Australia into silence about Covid-19,” alleged Senator Jim Inhofe, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. “And now 20 Indian soldiers are dead – some killed by what are essentially baseball bats with spikes – as China continues its premeditated military incursion along the border with India,” Inhofe said on the Senate floor in support of the National Defense Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2021. The National Defense Authorization Act for 2021 is all about sending a message to China and Russia, he said. It says, “There is no way you can defeat us — so don’t even try.” “We know that the way we preserve peace is by demonstrating our strength. We have the best military in the world — and our enemies need to know that. But we can’t rest on our laurels. We must implement the National Defense Strategy because our comparative military advantage is at risk right now. China and Russia are catching up to us — and quickly,” Inhofe said. China and Russia have invested in their military, he said, adding that the two have willfully mislead on many things – including the actual size of their defense budgets. Russia’s is almost three times larger than most people think. Because of these investments, China and Russia have grown not just the size of their military but their capabilities as well. “Last October, China paraded a hypersonic weapon, showing off a technology we don’t even have yet,” he added. “Their investments aren’t restricted by their borders. I’ve seen their build-up in action across the world. One prime example: China just built its first overseas military base – in Djibouti, right on one of the world’s most important maritime routes,” Inhofe said. “I saw it firsthand: China is trying to take control of more than 40 ports in sub-Saharan Africa. Now, we see China and Russia grow more and more aggressive and antagonistic,” said the top American Senator. Aimed at China, the bill among other things, establishes the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, which will focus resources on the Indo-Pacific - addressing key military capability gaps, reassuring its allies and partners, and bolstering its credibility, Inhofe said. “The bill ensures we have a combat-credible forward posture and helps us develop and field the joint capabilities needed to take on the conflicts envisioned by the NDS. We push back on China’s and Russia’s attempts to expand their influence by building new alliances and partnerships and strengthening existing ones,” he said. “We protect against intrusion from China and Russia – in space, cyberspace, and beyond. We safeguard proprietary technology and intellectual property from being infiltrated by the government of China. We also reduce our reliance on foreign countries like China as a source for a variety of materials and technologies, including microelectronics and rare earth minerals – but also medical devices and pharmaceuticals,” the Senator said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-used-covid-19-to-lash-out-in-every-direction-us-senator/story-ymoUjlIIwhXG5nMBn0NqoO.html
26-06-2020||World||Huawei executive trial: Justin Trudeau rejects calls to stop extradition in exchange of 2 Canadians||Implying that the country will not succumb to hostage diplomacy, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has rebuffed a letter from a group including four former federal ministers, that asked him to have an extradition trial against a senior Huawei executive in Vancouver stopped so she could return to China in exchange for the release of two Canadians imprisoned there.During his daily media briefing, Trudeau said the letter writers were “wrong in their approach”. Expanding on the issue, he said that if countries around the world, including China, believed that “by arbitrarily arresting random Canadians” they could influence Canada politically, that would leave a “lot more Canadians who travel around the world vulnerable to that kind of pressure.”Trudeau’s rebuff came as 13 Canadian senators sought to have sanctions imposed upon Chinese officials involved in human rights violations targeting Muslim Uighurs, Tibetans and residents of Hong Kong.Trudeau was referring to the ongoing trial of Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese telecommunications company Huwaei and daughter of its founder. She is facing trial in Vancouver and could potentially be extradited to the US on charges related to committing fraud and bypass international sanctions against the Iranian regime. Days after she was detained in Vancouver in December 2018, two Canadians including a former diplomat, were arrested by Chinese authorities, who charged them with spying last week.“We need to continue to be absolutely crystal clear that Canada has an independent judiciary and those processes will unfold independently of any political pressure, including by foreign governments,” Trudeau said, according to the outlet CBC. “We deplore what China did,” he added. The letter writers include three former foreign ministers and a former justice minister, among others. “I respect these distinguished Canadians who put forward that letter but I deeply disagree with them,” Trudeau said.Meanwhile, in another letter to Trudeau, Canadian senators have asked him to respond to China’s “tyrannical behaviour” by imposing sanctions upon Chinese officials for “gross violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms,” according to CBC.Those sanctions can be imposed under Canada’s Sergei Magnitsky Law, named after a Russian expert who was killed by authorities in Moscow over exposing fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/huawei-executive-trial-justin-trudeau-rejects-calls-to-stop-extradition-in-exchange-of-2-canadians/story-th7hLFruXmNM71ZkI6pWYM.html
26-06-2020||World||US officials change virus risk groups, add pregnant women||The nation’s top public health agency on Thursday reset its list of which Americans are at higher risk for severe Covid-19 illness, adding pregnant women and removing age alone as a factor.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also altered the list of underlying conditions that make someone more susceptible to suffering and death. Sickle cell disease joined the list, for example. And the threshold for risky levels of obesity was lowered.The changes didn’t include adding race as a risk factor for serious illness, despite accumulating evidence that Black people, Hispanics and Native Americans have higher rates of infection, hospitalization and death.Agency officials said the update was prompted by medical studies published since CDC first started listing high-risk groups. They also sought to publicize the information before Independence Day weekend, when many people may be tempted to go out and socialize.“For those at higher risk, we recommend limiting contact with others as much as possible, or restricting contacts to a small number of people who are willing to take measures to reduce the risk of (you) becoming infected,” said CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield.The same advice holds for people who live with or care for people at higher risk, Redfield added.Previously, the CDC said those at high risk of serious illness included people aged 65 years and older; those who live in a nursing home or long-term care facility; and people with serious heart conditions, obesity, diabetes, liver disease, chronic kidney disease, chronic lung disease, and conditions that leave them with weakened immune systems.In the changes, CDC created categories of people who are at high risk and people who might be at high risk.Those who are at high risk include people with chronic kidney disease, chronic inflammatory lung disease, obesity, serious heart conditions, sickle cell disease, Type 2 diabetes, and weakened immune systems because of organ transplants. The threshold for obesity concern was lowered from a body mass index of 40 down to 30.The CDC said people are at increasing risk as they get older, but it removed people 65 and older as a high risk group.The list of people who might be at high risk includes pregnant women, smokers and those with asthma, diseases that affect blood flow to the brain, cystic fibrosis, high blood pressure, dementia, liver disease, scarred or damaged lungs, Type 1 diabetes, a rare blood disorder called thalassemia, and people who have weakened immune systems due to HIV or other reasons.Pregnant women joined the list on the same day a CDC report found they accounted for about 9% of lab-confirmed Covid-19 cases in women of childbearing age. About 5% of women of childbearing age are pregnant at any given time.The report showed that pregnant women had higher rates of hospitalization, of admission to a hospital intensive care unit and of winding up on a breathing machine vs. young women who weren’t pregnant. There was no clear evidence of a higher death rate among pregnant women, however.It’s not completely surprising, said Dr. Denise Jamieson, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at the Emory University School of Medicine. Pregnant women have been found to be at higher risk from other infectious respiratory diseases, likely because the lungs decrease in the volume as the uterus grows, Jamieson said.What is surprising, she said, is that CDC didn’t place pregnant women in the highest risk category.“To me this is the most compelling evidence to date that pregnant women are at increased risk,” said Jamieson, who spent 20 years at CDC as a reproductive health expert.Earlier this week, CDC officials called on a panel of experts to help them identify groups that should be prioritized for coronavirus vaccinations if one becomes available and supplies are limited.Pregnant women could be among that group. So could certain racial and ethnic groups.CDC officials shared data with the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices that showed, compared with white Americans, coronavirus hospitalization rates were 4 times higher for Hispanics, 4.5 times higher for Black people, and 5.5 higher for American Indians and Alaska Natives. A recent study in the Atlanta area suggested that being Black was as large a risk for hospitalization as having diabetes, being a smoker or being obese.“If we fail to address racial and ethnic groups as at high risk for prioritization, whatever comes out of our group will be looked at very suspiciously and with a lot of reservation,” said Dr. Jose Romero, chair of the expert panel.“They are groups that need to be moved to the forefront,” he said.CDC officials say they expect to come out with recommendations for racial and ethnic minority groups soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-officials-change-virus-risk-groups-add-pregnant-women/story-iSOECGKpLsjl9sRPrPfxGJ.html
26-06-2020||World||Vaccine against Covid-19 not certain, maybe in a year: WHO||It is not certain that scientists will be able to create an effective vaccine against the coronavirus that has caused the Covid-19 pandemic, but it could take a year before one were to be invented, the head of the World Health Organisation said.Speaking by video-conference to deputies from the European Parliament’s health committee, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that if such a vaccine became a reality, it should become a public good available to all.“It would be very difficult to say for sure that we will have a vaccine,” Tedros said. “We never had a vaccine for a coronavirus. So this will be, when discovered, hoping that it will be discovered, it will be the first one,” he said.He said the WHO had already more than a 100 candidates for a vaccine of which one was at an advanced stage of development.“Hoping that there will be a vaccine, the estimate is we may have a vaccine within one year. If accelerated, it could be even less than that, but by a couple of months. That’s what scientists are saying,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-against-covid-19-not-certain-maybe-in-a-year-who/story-2KR43T9ZJdwArkqUcSFSkL.html
26-06-2020||World||‘Elaborate and sophisticated fraud’: Wirecard collapses owing $4 billion to creditors||Wirecard collapsed on Thursday owing creditors almost $4 billion after disclosing a gaping hole in its books that its auditor EY said was the result of a sophisticated global fraud.The payments company filed for insolvency at a Munich court saying that, with 1.3 billion euros ($1.5 billion) of loans due within a week its survival as a going concern was “not assured”.Wirecard’s implosion came just seven days after EY, its auditor for more than a decade, refused to sign off on the 2019 accounts, forcing out Chief Executive Markus Braun and leading it to admit that $2.1 billion of its cash probably didn’t exist.“There are clear indications that this was an elaborate and sophisticated fraud involving multiple parties around the world,” EY said in a statement.EY said while it was completing the 2019 audit, it was provided with false confirmations with regard to escrow accounts and reported them to the relevant authorities.Wirecard declined to comment following EY’s statement.The financial technology company is the first member of Germany’s prestigious DAX stock index to go bust, barely two years after winning a spot among the country’s top 30 listed companies with a market valuation of $28 billion.“The Wirecard case damages corporate Germany. It should be a wake-up call for reforms,” said Volker Potthoff, chairman of corporate governance think-tank ArMID.Creditors have scant hope of getting back the 3.5 billion euros they are owed, sources familiar with the matter said. Of that total, Wirecard has borrowed 1.75 billion from 15 banks and issued 500 million in bonds.“The money’s gone,” said one banker. “We may recoup a few euros in a couple of years but will write off the loan now.”‘TOTAL DISASTER’The collapse of Wirecard, once one of the hottest fintech companies in Europe, dwarfs other German corporate failures. It has shaken the country’s financial establishment with Felix Hufeld, head of regulator BaFin, calling it a “total disaster”.German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz described the collapse as a “scandal”, acknowledging it was time to review regulation. “We must rethink our supervisory structures,” said Scholz, adding he had asked his ministry to come up with ideas in the next few days.“If legal, legislative, regulatory measures are needed, we will embrace them and implement them,” he said. “A scandal like Wirecard is a wake-up call that we need more monitoring and oversight than we have today,” he said.Wirecard shares, which were suspended ahead of an earlier announcement that it would seek creditor protection, crashed 80% when trading resumed. They have lost 98% since auditor EY questioned its accounts last Thursday.EY, one of the world’s “Big Four” accountancy and consulting firms, faces a wave of litigation in a debacle that has drawn comparisons with Arthur Andersen’s disastrous oversight of U.S. energy company Enron.German law firm Schirp & Partner said that with Wirecard now effectively sidelined, it would file class actions against EY on behalf of shareholders and bondholders.“It is frightening how long Wirecard AG was able to operate without being objected to by the auditors,” partner Wolfgang Schirp said.Wirecard’s new management had been in crisis talks with creditors but pulled out on Thursday morning “due to impending insolvency and over-indebtedness”.The insolvency filing did not include its Wirecard Bank subsidiary, which holds an estimated 1.4 billion euros in deposits and is already under emergency management by BaFin.‘COMPLETE VINDICATION’A second source close to talks with creditors said although the company had a healthy core, it had faked two-thirds of its sales. This meant there was no way it could repay all its debt, notwithstanding all the legal challenges it will face.The ascent of Wirecard, which was founded in 1999 and is based in a Munich suburb, was dogged by allegations from whistleblowers, reporters and speculators that its revenue and profits had been pumped up through fake transactions.Braun fended off the critics for years before finally calling in outside auditor KPMG late last year to run an independent investigation.KPMG, which published its findings in April, was unable to verify 1 billion euros in cash balances, questioned Wirecard’s acquisition accounting and said it could not trace hundreds of millions in cash advances to merchants.“Today is a complete vindication for those that exposed the fraud,” said Fraser Perring, who bet on a fall in Wirecard’s shares and co-authored a 2016 report that alleged fraud.The Munich prosecutor’s office, which is investigating Braun on suspicion of misrepresenting Wirecard’s accounts and of market manipulation, said: “We will now look at all possible criminal offences.”Braun was arrested on Monday and released on bail of 5 million euros a day later. Former chief operating officer Jan Marsalek is also under suspicion and believed to be in the Philippines, according to justice officials there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elaborate-and-sophisticated-fraud-wirecard-collapses-owing-4-billion/story-CmIKncq5NZCPbGwEOwFAgP.html
26-06-2020||World||Pak PM Imran Khan draws flak for calling Osama Bin Laden a ‘martyr’||Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan has drawn flak for calling the slain al-Qaeda chief Osama Bin Laden a “shaheed” or martyr, leading parliamentarians to seek an apology. Speaking in parliament on Thursday amid rising criticism of his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, Khan connected the issue to the US criticism of Pakistan’s role in the war on terror. “They came into our country and killed Osama Bin Laden, martyred him, all the world criticised us instead.” Khan said Pakistan supported the war on terror but US continued to blame Pakistan. “We were even blamed for their failures in Afghanistan... we were not sure whether America was our ally or our enemy,” he said.Laden was killed in a military operation by US Navy Seals in 2011 in Abbottabad.Slamming Khan’s speech, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari of PPP said, “I can only compare this to how the state of Pakistan sent soldiers to fight in Kargil. They sent them to their deaths and we did not even acknowledge them.” Khawaja Asif of the opposition PML-N said Khan’s speech was “riddled with errors on history and politics”. He said Osama“brought terrorism to my country. He destroyed my country and Imran Khan has declared him a shaheed”.Asif said, “Zia ul Haq brought Osama to Pakistan and Imran Khan has called him a shaheed.”The row came as Islamabad rejected the US state department’s annual report on terrorism as “self-contradictory” and “selective” in its characterisation of Pakistan’s efforts to counter terrorism and terror financing.The US report has accused Pakistan of continuing to be a “safe haven” for terrorist groups such as Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Muhammad.Pakistan International Airlines said on Thursday it has grounded almost a third of its pilots for holding fake or dubious licences, a month after one of its planes crashed into houses killing 97 people. The move came after the government released a preliminary report into the May 22 crash in Karachi. PIA spokesman Abdullah Hafeez Khan said a probe had found about 150 of its 434 pilots were carrying “either bogus or suspicious licences”.“We have decided to ground those 150 pilots with immediate effect,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-pm-imran-khan-draws-flak-for-calling-osama-bin-laden-a-martyr/story-EVNPOy8NtH4eGOlW2f0WRN.html
26-06-2020||World||European regulator recommends remdesivir for Covid-19 treatment||The European healthcare regulator has recommended the conditional approval of Gilead Sciences Inc’s antiviral treatment, remdesivir, for use in Covid-19 patients, making it the first treatment to be on track to be green-lit in the continent.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Thursday its human medicines committee (CHMP) recommended the drug’s use in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with pneumonia who require oxygen support.The price of the drug in the region is not yet known. In the United States, it could be priced up to $5,080 per course, while Indian generic drugmakers will sell the treatment between 5,000 rupees to 6,000 rupees ($66.13-$79.35).The EMA endorsement, which comes just weeks after a speedy review, means physicians can prescribe the Gilead drug, to be branded Veklury, in Europe once approved by the European Commission, which usually follows CHMP recommendations.Also reads | India’s Hetero prices generic remdesivir for Covid-19 treatment at Rs5,400 per vialThe EU’s conditional marketing authorisation allows a treatment to be sold for a year in the 27-nation trading bloc before all necessary data on its efficacy and side-effects are available. Gilead has to submit final data by December.Demand for the drug soared after it became a front-runner following promise in trials. Gilead expects supply of remdesivir to exceed two million courses by year-end, double its previous target, and is planning to begin testing of an easier-to-use inhaled version of the drug, given intravenously as of now. Remdesivir has already been approved for emergency use in severely-ill patients in the United States, India and South Korea, and has received full approval in Japan.($1 = 75.6105 Indian rupees)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-regulator-recommends-remdesivir-for-covid-19-treatment/story-r0rQr687STv1xcTvDGd3UK.html
