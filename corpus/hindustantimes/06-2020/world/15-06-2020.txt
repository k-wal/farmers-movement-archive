The attempt failed after He’s son escaped and swam across a lake to raise the alarm, Forbes reported.He has a net worth of about $24 billion according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Police in Foshan, a city in the southern Guangdong province, said they received a report at 5:30 p.m. Sunday that someone broke into an apartment in a residential community owned by Midea and threatened the homeowner’s safety, according to a statement on their official WeChat account.Five suspects were arrested early Monday, according to the police.Midea Group reposted the police statement on its official Weibo account without elaborating. A company representative told Bloomberg the case is under investigation by police and that Midea had no other details to share.Midea, founded in 1968, is known for its low- to medium-end appliances. He retired as chairman in 2012, after building the company into China’s biggest exporter of air conditioners. The stock closed 3.3% after the close in Shenzhen Monday.Worries about kidnapping have prompted more of the world’s richest people to spend millions of dollars on security in recent years.Walls, fences or other barriers surrounding homes of the ultra-wealthy are typically equipped with motion sensors and monitored by cameras that can be programmed to recognize certain faces. Some are tailed by bodyguards at all hours. Typical measures inside residences can include ballistic windows, safe rooms as well as reinforced doors, walls and locks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kidnapping-of-china-s-7th-richest-man-thwarted-after-son-swims-across-a-lake-to-raise-alarm/story-DZdrikj1UDh02wvN7jY4lJ.html

His statue in Parliament Square has been boarded up after protestors wrote ‘was a racist’ below it.Johnson, who has opposed attempts to remove statues of historical figures demanded by BLM protestors, wrote in The Daily Telegraph that much has changed in the UK on race, but admitted that there is much more than needs to be done.Author of a 2014 book on Churchill, Johnson wrote that his predecessor was a hero but one who expressed “all sorts of views” during his political career.“As it happens, he generally changed with the times. He changed his view on India, and her capacity for independence; and whatever he may have said about Islam in the 1890s, he also built the Regent’s Park Mosque in the 1940s”, he wrote.“And above all – as so many have rightly pointed out – it is the height of lunacy to accuse him of racism, when he stood alone against a racist tyranny that without his resistance would have overwhelmed this country and the rest of Europe”.Labour and anti-racism campaigners promptly dismissed Johnson’s brief announcement in the article – with little detail – to set up a “cross-departmental commission” to look into inequalities in employment, health and other aspects of lifeShadow justice secretary David Lammy said that if Johnson were serious about wanting to address racial inequalities, he should implement the recommendations of the many reviews already conducted instead of setting up a new commission or inquiry.He said: “I made 35 specific recommendations in the Lammy review. Implement them. There are 110 recommendations in the Anjiolini review into deaths into police custody. Implement them. There are 30 recommendations in the Home Office review into the Windrush scandal”.“Implement them. Twenty six into Baroness McGregor’s review into workplace discrimination. Implement them. That’s what Boris has to do. And the Black Lives protests can stop and we can get on with dealing with the coronavirus”, he added.Johnson reiterated in the article his opposition to statues being pulled down, stating that he would “resist with every breath in my body” any attempt to remove Churchill’s statue in Parliament Square.He wrote: “It is not just that is wrong to destroy public property by violence. I am also extremely dubious about the growing campaign to edit or photoshop the entire cultural landscape”.“Would it not be better and more honest to ask our children to understand the context, to explain the mixture of good and bad in the career of Churchill and everyone else?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/churchill-changed-view-on-india-s-freedom-in-later-years-claims-pm-boris-johnson/story-5tcwbCBsgppEXoUSQZdtgL.html

The pilot remains missing.The F-15C Eagle from the 48th Fighter Wing was on a routine training mission from RAF Lakenheath when it crashed at 9:40 a.m. The cause of the crash wasn’t immediately clear.Britain’s coast guard located wreckage from the downed fighter, and recovery efforts were underway, the U.S. Air Force said in a statement.”The pilot is still missing, and search and rescue efforts continue,” the statement added.Coast guard officials said in a statement that they received reports the plane went down 74 nautical miles off Flamborough Head on the Yorkshire coast.A helicopter and lifeboats have been deployed.“Other vessels nearby are heading to the area,” the coast guard said in a statement.Lakenheath is a Royal Air Force base that hosts the U.S. Air Force’s 48th Fighter Wing, known as the Liberty Wing. The base is about 80 miles (130 kilometers) northeast of London.The wing has more than 4,500 active-duty military members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilot-of-us-air-force-jet-that-crashed-in-north-sea-is-dead/story-P7zpJXCWwhzIUHBKwE8ZTJ.html
15-06-2020||World||UK PM Boris Johnson’s new anti-racism commission triggers row||A brief announcement by Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday of a commission into racism in the UK sparked a row with the opposition Labour and others asking him to implement recommendations of earlier reports instead of setting up a new one.Johnson announced the “cross-departmental commission” in an article in The Daily Telegraph, in which he wrote that though much has changed in the UK on issues of race, there is much more that needs to be done.Reiterating his opposition to pulling down statues of historical figures, including that of “hero” Winston Churchill, Johnson, who authored a biography of Churchill in 2014, wrote that the man whom many consider the ‘greatest Briton’ had expressed “all sorts of views”.“As it happens, he generally changed with the times. He changed his view on India, and her capacity for independence; and whatever he may have said about Islam in the 1890s, he also built the Regent’s Park Mosque in the 1940s”, he wrote.Labour dismissed the announcement of the new commission to look into inequalities in employment, health and other aspects of life.Shadow justice secretary David Lammy said that if Johnson were serious about wanting to address racial inequalities, he should implement the recommendations of the many reviews already conducted instead of setting up a new commission or inquiry.He said: “I made 35 specific recommendations in the Lammy review. Implement them. There are 110 recommendations in the Anjiolini review into deaths into police custody. Implement them. There are 30 recommendations in the Home Office review into the Windrush scandal”.“Implement them. Twenty six into Baroness McGregor’s review into workplace discrimination. Implement them. That’s what Boris has to do. And the Black Lives protests can stop and we can get on with dealing with the coronavirus”, he added.A Downing Street spokesperson said the government is implementing recommendations of previous reports, and added that the new commission will look into issues such as the under-performance of white working class boys in schools.On the issue of statues being pulled down, as witnessed in Bristol on June 7, Johnson wrote that he would “resist with every breath in my body” any attempt to remove Churchill’s statue in Parliament Square in London.He wrote: “It is not just that is wrong to destroy public property by violence. I am also extremely dubious about the growing campaign to edit or photoshop the entire cultural landscape”.“Would it not be better and more honest to ask our children to understand the context, to explain the mixture of good and bad in the career of Churchill and everyone else?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-s-new-anti-racism-commission-triggers-row/story-UXEsDh18HNMN8chcyUFYmM.html
15-06-2020||World||Supreme Court says gay, transgender workers protected by law||The Supreme Court ruled Monday that a landmark civil rights law protects gay, lesbian and transgender people from discrimination in employment, a resounding victory for LGBT rights from a conservative court.The court decided by a 6-3 vote that a key provision of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 known as Title VII that bars job discrimination because of sex, among other reasons, encompasses bias against LGBT workers.“An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have questioned in members of a different sex,” Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the court. “Sex plays a necessary and undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids.”The decision was a defeat not just for the employers, but also the Trump administration, which argued that the law’s plain wording compelled a ruling for the employers. Gorsuch, a conservative appointee of President Donald Trump, concluded the opposite.He was joined in the majority by Chief Justice John Roberts and the court’s four liberal members. Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump’s other Supreme Court pick, dissented, along with Justices Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas.“The Court tries to convince readers that it is merely enforcing the terms of the statute, but that is preposterous,” Alito wrote in the dissent. “Even as understood today, the concept of discrimination because of ‘sex’ is different from discrimination because of ‘sexual orientation’ or ‘gender identity.‘”Kavanaugh wrote in a separate dissent that the court was rewriting the law to include gender identity and sexual orientation, a job that belongs to Congress. Still, Kavanaugh said the decision represents an “important victory achieved today by gay and lesbian Americans.”The outcome is expected to have a big impact for the estimated 8.1 million LGBT workers across the country because most states don’t protect them from workplace discrimination. An estimated 11.3 million LGBT people live in the U.S., according to the Williams Institute at the UCLA law school.Gerald Bostock, a gay county government worker from Georgia whose lawsuit was one of three the Supreme Court decided Monday, said no should should have to be “fearful of losing their job because of who they are, who they love or how they identify. And the justices have now made sure that we won’t have to worry about that.”John Bursch, who argued the appeal from a Michigan funeral home owner against a fired transgender employee, said, “Americans must be able to rely on what the law says, and it is disappointing that a majority of the justices were unwilling to affirm that commonsense principle. Redefining ‘sex’ to mean ‘gender identity’ will create chaos and enormous unfairness for women and girls in athletics, women’s shelters, and many other contexts.”But Monday’s decision is not likely to be the court’s last word on a host of issues revolving around LGBT rights, Gorsuch noted.Lawsuits are pending over transgender athletes’ participation in school sporting events, and courts also are dealing with cases about sex-segregated bathrooms and locker rooms, a subject that the justices seemed concerned about during arguments in October. Employers who have religious objections to employing LGBT people also might be able to raise those claims in a different case, Gorsuch said.“But none of these other laws are before us; we have not had the benefit of adversarial testing about the meaning of their terms, and we do not prejudge any such question today,” he wrote.The cases were the court’s first on LGBT rights since J ustice Anthony Kennedy’s retirement and replacement by Kavanaugh. Kennedy was a voice for gay rights and the author of the landmark ruling in 2015 that made same-sex marriage legal throughout the United States. Kavanaugh generally is regarded as more conservative.The Trump administration had changed course from the Obama administration, which supported LGBT workers in their discrimination claims under Title VII.During the Obama years, the federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had changed its longstanding interpretation of civil rights law to include discrimination against LGBT people. The law prohibits discrimination because of sex, but has no specific protection for sexual orientation or gender identity.Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden, Obama’s vice president, praised the decision on Twitter as “another step in our march toward equality for all. The Supreme Court has confirmed the simple but profoundly American idea that every human being should be treated with respect.”In recent years, some lower courts have held that discrimination against LGBT people is a subset of sex discrimination, and thus prohibited by the federal law.Efforts by Congress to change the law to explicitly bar job discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity have so far failed.The Supreme Court cases involved two gay men and a transgender woman who sued for employment discrimination after they lost their jobs.Aimee Stephens lost her job as a funeral director in the Detroit area after she revealed to her boss that she had struggled with gender most of her life and had, at long last, “decided to become the person that my mind already is.” Stephens told funeral home owner Thomas Rost that following a vacation, she would report to work wearing a conservative skirt suit or dress that Rost required for women who worked at his three funeral homes. Rost fired Stephens.The 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, Ohio, ruled that the firing constituted sex discrimination under federal law.Stephens died last month. Donna Stephens, her wife of 20 years, said in a statement that she is “grateful for this victory to honor the legacy of Aimee, and to ensure people are treated fairly regardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity.”The federal appeals court in New York ruled in favor of a gay skydiving instructor who claimed he was fired because of his sexual orientation. The full 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled 10-3 that it was abandoning its earlier holding that Title VII didn’t cover sexual orientation because “legal doctrine evolves.” The court held that “sexual orientation discrimination is motivated, at least in part, by sex and is thus a subset of sex discrimination.”That ruling was a victory for the relatives of Donald Zarda, who was fired in 2010 from a skydiving job in Central Islip, New York, that required him to strap himself tightly to clients so they could jump in tandem from an airplane. He tried to put a woman with whom he was jumping at ease by explaining that he was gay. The school fired Zarda after the woman’s boyfriend called to complain.Zarda died in a wingsuit accident in Switzerland in 2014.In a case from Georgia, the federal appeals court in Atlanta ruled against Bostock, a gay employee of Clayton County, in the Atlanta suburbs. Bostock claimed he was fired in 2013 because he is gay. The county argues that Bostock was let go because of the results of an audit of funds he managed.The 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed Bostock’s claim in a three-page opinion that noted the court was bound by a 1979 decision that held “discharge for homosexuality is not prohibited by Title VII.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/supreme-court-says-gay-transgender-workers-protected-by-law/story-5otEXZRgB9iOUjfRBS9R3J.html
15-06-2020||World||US ‘outraged’ over Russia convicting American businessman for spying||The United States on Monday reacted with “outrage” to the sentencing of an American businessman by a Russian court to 16 years on charges of spying, at the end of a trial held in secret.“The United States is outraged by the decision of a Russian court today to convict US citizen Paul Whelan after a secret trial, with secret evidence, and without appropriate allowances for defense witnesses,” Secretary of State Michael Pompeo said in a statement.Pompeo went on to allege Whelan has bene treated poorly in Russian prison and demanded his “immediate release”.A Moscow city court has sent Whelan to a maximum security prison.Whelan’s twin brother David Whelan has said they will appeal the verdict. “The court’s decision merely completes the final piece of this broken judicial process.”“We had hoped that the court might show some independence but, in the end, Russian judges are political, not legal, entities,” the statement said. “We look to the U.S. government to immediately take steps to bring Paul home.”Whelan’s lawyer and brother have said he was arrested in a sting operation. The American businessman, who is in corporate security, was arrested from outside a Moscow hotel in December 2018. His lawyer has said he had been handed a thumb-drive, which had confidential information that he did not know about. Whelan is an ex-Marine and holds Canadian, British and Irish passports. There has been speculation in US media that Whelan was arrested for a swap in which Moscow would like to exchange him for Russians in US custody, which would be one of the two — Viktor Bout, a gun-runner who was arrested in Thailand in 2008 and extradited to America in 2010; and Konstantin Yaroshenko, a pilot arrested in 2010 for conspiracy to smuggle cocaine.There was a third candidate earlier, Maria Butina, who called herself a gun rights activist and had infiltrated conservative circles. She was arrested in July 2018, six months before Whelan, and convicted subsequently for acting as a foreign agent (which is different from spying). She was deported last October.Media reports indicate Russia may be interested in a swap involving Yaroshenko, who is serving a 20 year sentence. His American lawyer has asked for his release citing the Covid-19 pandemic because he has several medical conditions. Russian ambassador to the US wrote to Attorney General William Barr in April seeking “humane treatment” of the incarcerate pilot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-outraged-after-russia-convicts-american-businessman-for-spying/story-Nrc9WxoxrqUM25soZyflDL.html

Citing reports of heart complications, the FDA said the drugs pose a greater risk to patients than any potential benefits.The decades-old drugs, also prescribed for lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, can cause heart rhythm problems, severely low blood pressure and muscle or nerve damage.The move means that shipments of the drugs obtained by the federal government will no longer be distributed to state and local health authorities. The drugs are still available for alternate uses, so U.S. doctors could still prescribe them for Covid-19 — a practice known as off-label prescribing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-revokes-emergency-use-of-malaria-drugs-vs-coronavirus/story-BJQMNZYUYcSzIhPBDBbvJK.html

It has been four days since the first infection was detected.The WHO is still waiting for China to share the genome sequence of the virus extracted from infected samples, which were picked up by Chinese scientists over the weekend from the Xinfadi market soon after it was shut down to the outside world.To a Reuters question whether China has shared the gene sequence with WHO, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said on Monday: “China has maintained close communication with the World Health Organisation. As for the specific question you mentioned, I don’t know the specific situation yet. Please inquire directly to the competent department.”Beijing has logged in as many as 79 new cases since June 11, the most significant flare-up in a major Chinese city that is home to China’s political and business elite.“The WHO has not visited the Xinfadi market in relation to this cluster of Covid-19, with the first confirmed cases on June 11,” the Organisation said in a statement to Hindustan Times on Monday, adding that it was receiving updates from the Chinese health authorities.Dozens of residential communities have been locked down, schools have been closed and emergency response levels are being gradually raised across the city’s districts after the rapidly spreading cluster infection emerged from the sprawling market.Beijing is said to be preparing to test at least 90,000 people connected to the market and living in its neighbourhood.The Xinfadi Agricultural Products Wholesale market, which also deals in meat and seafood, is located some 25 km away from the WHO office in Beijing.Until Monday evening, the WHO, the UN’s specialised agency for international public health, had only received briefings about the new and fast spreading cluster from Chinese health authorities – without any first-hand knowledge about a worrying infection that has resurfaced in Beijing – which had zero cases since April -- after a gap of 55 days.It was not immediately clear if Beijing is yet to give consent to the WHO, as per protocol, to send a team to the Xinfadi market in the southwest Fengtai district.The market was shuttered over the weekend and scientists from the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, experts from its Beijing centre and the national health commission (NHC) have scoured the market, picked up samples and conducted preliminary tests.According to state media reports, the virus was detected on a salmon chopping board.The WHO did not answer HT’s query whether it had asked Chinese authorities to visit the market but said it was receiving regular updates from health authorities.“The information thus far has come from Chinese national and municipal health officials, in briefings and exchanges with the WHO office in China and updates sent via the International Health Regulations mechanism,” the statement said.“In our exchanges, the WHO has received a briefing on the preliminary investigation, offered support and technical assistance. Chinese health authorities have agreed to continue to exchange further information about the cluster and the investigations underway and planned,” the statement said.The organisation is yet to receive gene sequencing results.“The WHO encourages the sharing of this and other sequences on a publicly available website as soon as possible. We await more genetic sequencing to see how close this virus is to others. We have asked China for the genetic sequencing and to receive new data on the epidemic as the investigation unfolds; and our counterparts are committed to continuing to provide such data. The WHO is following up with Chinese officials for further detail,” the statement added.An Associated Press report released earlier this month said the WHO worked on minimal information during the beginning of the outbreak in China in December and January, alleging that Beijing was deliberately slow in sharing critical information.Both China and WHO denied it.The WHO director general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, has praised China for “setting a new standard for outbreak response” through swift and aggressive measures.While the pandemic rages globally, China has sharply brought down the infection numbers across the country with the government saying that the outbreak has been effectively controlled, until the virus reemerged in Beijing last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cluster-of-covid-19-in-chinese-capital-who-yet-to-visit-affected-site/story-0ZvDsQ4eWV3D3VWHg9dz8K.html
15-06-2020||World||Black man carries injured white person to safety at London anti-racism protest||“That’s not what we do!”Reuters photographer Dylan Martinez heard the words ring out during chaotic scenes in London on Saturday, when mostly peaceful anti-racist demonstrations turned into violent scuffles with counter-protesters in the area.Then he saw the man who had uttered them - a black protester emerging from the melee carrying an injured white man in a ‘fireman’s lift’ over his shoulder.The picture he took has gone viral on social media and featured in news bulletins, capturing a moment of high drama that jars with the broader narrative - of anti-racist and far-right protesters fighting each other.“I saw a skirmish and someone falling to the ground,” Martinez recalled of the moment near Waterloo Bridge, in central London, as he covered anti-racism protests that have flared up in the city.The two men then appeared through the crowd.“The crowd parted right in front of me. I was in the right place at right time, and incredibly lucky from that point of view. He came towards me walking briskly.”Martinez said the man being carried had injuries to his face, and Reuters journalists at the scene said he had been beaten in a skirmish with anti-racism protesters.Some people in the crowd shouted out that the assault victim was a member of the far-right.Reuters was not able to identify the victim or his political leanings. Police said they were aware of the incident and the photograph, but made no further comment when Reuters asked for details of the men’s identity and what happened.Protests have erupted across British cities and around the world after a black man, George Floyd, died in police custody in Minneapolis on May 25.In some cases they have sparked counter-demonstrations by people who do not agree with all of their aims and methods, and these have included people from far-right groups.British media identified the black man as Patrick Hutchinson, a personal trainer. On his social media account, he wrote: “We saved a life today”.Reuters spoke to the partner of Hutchinson’s best friend, who confirmed it was him. Hutchinson did not reply to calls to his mobile phone.He told British Channel 4 News on Sunday it was a “scary” scene. “It was pretty hectic, it was almost like a stampede.“...The guys went in there, they sort of put a little cordon around him to stop him receiving any more physical harm. His life was under threat.“So I just went under, scooped him up and put him on my shoulders and sort of started marching towards the police with him whilst all the guys were surrounding me and protecting me and the guy I had on my shoulder.”In a statement on Sunday police said 113 people had been arrested over the weekend and 23 officers were injured in the violence, none of them seriously.The reaction on social media to the picture and events it portrayed has been largely positive.“Amid all the ugliness, a beautiful moment of humanity,” wrote British journalist Piers Morgan in a Tweet accompanying the photograph.Martinez, a veteran photographer who is Reuters’ picture editor for the United Kingdom and Ireland, said the protests in London on Saturday had been fluid and unpredictable.After witnessing sporadic, minor clashes between demonstrators and police in Trafalgar Square, Martinez said he switched attention to nearby Waterloo Bridge, where several hundred anti-racism protesters had gathered.“They took over the whole of the bridge,” he said. “There was a traffic jam going from south to north, but the vibe was good - cars were honking and people were celebrating.”The mood quickly turned ugly when they encountered a group of counter-protesters and clashes broke out, Martinez said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-man-carries-injured-white-person-to-safety-at-london-protest/story-gfzhIABVlFOQ0RY6YuMSsK.html
15-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Europe’s borders reopen but long road for tourism to recover||Borders opened up across Europe on Monday after three months of coronavirus closures that began chaotically in March. But many restrictions persist, it’s unclear how keen Europeans will be to travel this summer and the continent is still closed to Americans, Asians and other international tourists.Border checks for most Europeans were dropped overnight in Germany, France and elsewhere, nearly two weeks after Italy opened its frontiers. The European Union’s 27 nations, as well as those in the Schengen passport-free travel area, which also includes a few non-EU nations such as Switzerland, aren’t expected to start opening to visitors from outside the continent until at least the beginning of next month, and possibly later.Announcing Monday’s reopening of borders and Paris restaurants, French President Emmanuel Macron said it’s time “to turn the page of the first act of the crisis” and “rediscover our taste for freedom.”But he warned: “This doesn’t mean the virus has disappeared and we can totally let down our guard. ... The summer of 2020 will be a summer unlike any other.”That caution is widespread after more than 182,000 virus-linked deaths in Europe. The region has had more than 2 million of the world’s 7.9 million confirmed infections, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University.“We have got the pandemic under control, (but) the reopening of our frontiers is a critical moment,” Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez said as he announced he was bringing forward Spain’s opening to European travelers by 10 days to June 21. “The threat is still real. The virus is still out there.”Even so, social distancing was in short supply as London’s Oxford Street shops reopened and Paris bistros like Café Des Anges welcomed back regular customers. Crowds jammed the entrance to London’s Niketown store despite efforts by employees to have an orderly line.“It’s very hard to get people who are sitting at the bar to respect social distancing,” said cafe manager Virgile Grunberg. “People have missed this, because they come in every morning before work, have a little coffee and a discussion, so of course it’s part of Paris.”The need to get Europe’s tourism industry up and running again is urgent, especially for Mediterranean nations like Spain, Italy and Greece as the economic fallout of the crisis mushrooms.“A lot will depend on whether people feel comfortable to travel and whether we can project Greece as a safe destination,” Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis acknowledged.On Monday, Greece welcomed the first international flights whose passengers didn’t face compulsory COVID-19 tests to Athens and Thessaloniki. Direct international flights to regional Greek airports, including on its sun-kissed islands, will begin on July 1. Visitors will be subject to random virus testing.In a trial run, Spain on Monday allowed the first of thousands of Germans to fly to its Balearic Islands — waiving its 14-day quarantine. The idea is to test out best practices in the coronavirus era.“This pilot program will help us learn a lot for what lies ahead,” Sánchez said. “We want our country, which is already known as a world-class tourist destination, to be recognized as also a secure destination.”Martin Hofman was delighted as he boarded the first flight from Duesseldorf to the island of Mallorca — a destination that mainland Spaniards can’t even visit yet.His holiday couldn’t be postponed “and to stay in Germany was not an option for us,” he said. “We are totally happy that we can get out.”Europe’s reopening isn’t a repeat of the chaotic free-for-all in March, when panicked, uncoordinated border closures caused traffic jams that stretched for miles.Still, it’s a complicated, shifting patchwork of different rules, and not everyone is equally free to travel everywhere. Norway and Denmark, for example, are keeping their borders closed with Sweden, whose virus strategy avoided a lockdown but produced a relatively high per capita death rate. Other nations also have travel restrictions for Swedes.In an interview with state broadcaster SVT, Prime Minister Stefan Lofven rejected that idea that Sweden’s strategy had failed, citing a continuing decline in hospitalizations and fatalities. While the rate of new infections has increased, officials say that reflects a long-delayed increase in testing.German drivers queued up in long lines Monday to cross into Denmark, which is letting in German visitors but only those who booked accommodations for at least six nights.Britain, which left the EU in January but remains closely aligned with the bloc until the end of this year, only last week imposed a 14-day quarantine requirement for most arrivals, horrifying its tourism and aviation industries. As a result, France is asking people from Britain to self-quarantine for two weeks and several other nations are not letting British tourists in during the first wave of reopenings.With flights only gradually picking up, nervousness about new outbreaks abroad, uncertainty about social distancing at tourist venues and millions facing record unemployment or pay cuts, many Europeans may choose to vacation at home.German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz are both planning to vacation in their homelands this year.The Dutch government said its citizens can now visit 16 European nations, but urged caution.“You can go abroad for your holiday again,” Foreign Minister Stef Blok said. “But it won’t be as carefree as before the corona crisis. The virus is still among us and the situation remains uncertain.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-europe-s-borders-reopen-but-long-road-for-tourism-to-recover/story-UPACkkbl5sZSfKUpAFTRWI.html
15-06-2020||World||‘Can’t forget those at home’: UK’s loneliness minister on writing letters||The UK’s minister for loneliness - described as the world’s first such minister - on Monday asked people to consider writing to the lonely amid the raging coronavirus pandemic.The portfolio was created by former Prime Minister Theresa May, when she appointed the first such minister in January 2018. The current minister is Diana Barran, a junior minister in the department of gigital, media, culture and sport.“Writing letters might be a slightly forgotten art but it’s more important than ever to connect with people, and putting pen to paper is an excellent way of making sure our friends, family and neighbours know we’re thinking about them,” said Barran.“The last few months have brought loneliness to the forefront of our minds. We all have a role in being kind and looking out for each other, and as some of us begin to regain some normality we cannot forget those who may need to stay at home for longer and could be at risk of feeling lonely,” she added.The initiative is part of ‘Loneliness Awareness Week’ (June 15-19).

They will be vital in helping kick-start the economy as we recover from the virus”, he added. The shops have re-opened in England, not elsewhere in the UK.The shops need to ensure they are ‘Covid-19 secure’ before opening, which includes barriers for queues outside, one-way routes inside shops and several posters inside to remind people to maintain at least 2 metre-distance from others.Officials said the non-essential retail sector employs 1.3 million people, accounting for £46.6 billion to British economy, which has seen its GDP plummet 20 per cent in April. The shops can re-open after meeting the ‘five tests’ set out by the Prime Minister Johnson.The five tests are: That the National Health Service can continue to cope; that the daily death rate falls sustainably and consistently; that the rate of infection is falling; that the operational challenges have been met; and most importantly, that there is no risk of a second peak.On Sunday, the UK recorded its lowest daily death toll of 36 since the lockdown began on March 23, besides dwindling number of news cases, encouraging the government to gradually re-open parts of the economy.However, London mayor Sadiq Khan joining experts to caution the people that the lockdown has not been lifted: “The virus is still out there…Stay at home as much as possible and avoid public transport”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-lockdown-long-queues-as-shops-re-open-in-england-after-more-than-2-months/story-xLPZ3MGqNpRPFUz6XNbN3I.html

15-06-2020||World||South Korea’s leader calls on North to stop raising tensions||South Korea’s president called on North Korea to stop raising animosities and return to talks, saying Monday the rivals must not reverse the peace deals that he and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un reached during 2018 summits.President Moon Jae-in’s efforts to defuse rising animosities came after North Korea threatened Friday to destroy an inter-Korean liaison office located in North Korea and take unspecified military steps against South Korea.If North Korean were to take such actions it would be a serious setback to Moon’s efforts toward Korean reconciliation and finding a negotiated solution to the North Korean nuclear issue.“North Korea must not sever communications and create tensions to turn back the clock to a past confrontational period,” Moon said during a meeting with top presidential advisers, according to his office. “We must not push back the pledges of peace that Chairman Kim Jong Un and I made.”Moon, a liberal who met Kim three times in 2018, was a driving force behind now-dormant diplomatic efforts between Pyongyang and Washington, including the summit between Kim and President Donald Trump in Singapore in 2018.During two of the three inter-Korean summits, Moon and Kim agreed to achieve denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and take other steps to boost exchanges and dial down military tensions. Those summits initially helped to improve their countries’ ties significantly, before their relations became strained again after the breakdown of a second Kim-Trump summit in Vietnam in early 2019.North Korea has recently unleashed a slew of harsh rhetoric against South Korea, accusing it of failing to prevent activists from launching propaganda leaflets across their border. In an apparent bid to soothe North Korea, Moon’s government vowed to ban civilian leafleting campaign. North Korea has said the South Korean response lacks sincerity.Some observers say North Korea is frustrated because Seoul has failed to break away from Washington and revive stalled joint economic projects held back by U.S.-led sanctions. They also speculate North Korea initially thought Moon would help it win badly needed sanctions relief but got upset after Kim returned home empty handed from the 2019 summit with Trump.Moon said the two Koreas must take the initiative in finding a breakthrough, calling the nations “the masters of the destiny for the Korean Peninsula.” He said his government will keep striving to promote dialogue with North Korea.Monday marks the 20th anniversary of the first-ever inter-Korean summit — between Kim’s late father Kim Jong Il and South Korea’s then-President Kim Dae-jung in Pyongyang.The Koreas remain split along the world’s most heavily fortified border since they were divided into a U.S.-backed South Korea and a Soviet-controlled North Korea at the end of the World War II in 1945.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-s-leader-calls-on-north-to-stop-raising-tensions/story-D57UR1usAY5BA3avH3j1WO.html

15-06-2020||World||Hong Kong security laws may not be retroactive, says China||Sweeping new national security laws being imposed on Hong Kong might not be retroactive, a Chinese official said, potentially limiting the scope of controversial legislation that’s currently being drafted in Beijing.Deng Zhonghua, deputy director of the Hong Kong and Macau Affairs Office, made the comments Monday at an event in the mainland border city of Shenzhen. The conference was organized by the Chinese Association of Hong Kong & Macau Studies and was attended by several officials responsible for affairs in the former British colony.“It needs to be clarified that, even though there are differences in the Hong Kong and mainland legal systems, the principles used in the mainland with regard to criminal laws are not fundamentally different from those in Hong Kong,” Deng said. “They all include principles such as the laws will not be applied retrospectively, presumption of innocence, suspects and defendants will have right to defense.”Deng added: “All these principles can be stipulated in this legislation.”The Chinese government and its appointed leaders in Hong Kong have been seeking to reassure local residents, foreign officials and overseas investors about the looming legislation. Pro-democracy activists and their supporters have expressed alarm about the security laws, which would criminalize the harshest criticism of Beijing after a year of unprecedented and often violent anti-government protests.Organizations ranging from business chambers to human rights groups have criticized Beijing’s move to bypass Hong Kong’s legislature and impose laws banning subversion, secession and foreign interference. Opponents say the push would undermine the freedoms promised to Hong Kong before its return to Chinese rule in 1997 and erode the city’s appeal as a global financial hub.For months last year, protesters chanted “Liberate Hong Kong! Revolution of our times!” in marches that drew more than a million people. One band of radicals broke into the Legislative Council on the anniversary of the handover, ransacking the chamber and defacing the city’s emblem. Some high-profile activists traveled to Washington to advocate for legislation that would punish Beijing for its crackdown.Deng’s comments echo remarks by Hong Kong Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng, who said in a blog post Sunday that the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region’s Common Law legal system had much in common with China’s system.“There are a number of commonalities between the civil and common law systems respectively in the Mainland and the HKSAR, such as retrospectivity, presumption of innocence, burden of proof and standard of proof, legal certainty, etc.,” she wrote.At the same time, she said it was “impracticable and unreasonable to expect that everything in a national law, the National Security Law, will be exactly as what a statute in the HKSAR common law jurisdiction would be like.”‘Rare Circumstances’In his remarks, Deng referred to Beijing’s plan to establish new national security enforcement mechanisms as part of the impending legislation, a move that has raised fears China would allow its security forces a free hand to operate openly in Hong Kong for the first time.Deng said that Hong Kong should remain in charge of most enforcement and legal processes surrounding the security legislation, but mentioned that China “should also reserve the right to have jurisdiction over cases that seriously endanger national security under very rare circumstances.” That reference could raise the specter of extradition -- an issue that sparked last year’s protests -- or trials by Communist Party-controlled judges.“For this law to be effective, the key is the establishment of strong enforcement mechanisms, including setting up agencies to safeguard national security and to grant them necessary enforcement powers,” Deng said. “Of course, there are only few cases where China will have jurisdiction over. It will not replace the responsibilities of Hong Kong’s relevant departments, nor would it affect judicial independence and final adjudication that Hong Kong enjoys under the Basic Law.”Proposed AgendaIt is not yet clear when China will finalize its plans for the new security laws.The National People’s Congress Standing Committee, the top decision-making body of China’s rubber-stamp legislature that had originally unveiled Beijing’s plan to impose the new laws, will hold its bi-monthly session from Thursday to Saturday. The Hong Kong national security legislation is not on a proposed agenda published last week.The Hong Kong security issue could be added in a last-minute change to the agenda, or the committee could also hold an interim meeting if there’s a special need to do so.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-security-laws-may-not-be-retroactive-says-china/story-JMH6JkXqeEzpqtfGAmYqcJ.html

Shops like Zara, John Lewis and Debenhams have slashed prices by as much as 70 per cent, local media reports said. These fashion stores are sitting on around £15 billion of unsold stock, the reports further said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, keen to see the UK economy start recovering from a coronavirus hammering, said on Sunday that people should ‘shop with confidence’.“I think people should shop and shop with confidence but they should of course observe the rules on social distancing and do it safely as well,” he said after touring the Westfield Stratford City shopping mall in east London.“I know people are anxious,” finance minister Rishi Sunak said on Sunday as he encouraged shopping to help kickstart an economy seeing unprecedented declines.“It’s a slightly different experience... but it is a safe environment and we should all be able to go out knowing that we should be able to shop in confidence,” he told Sky News. The stores have been closed since March 23 when Prime Minister Boris Johnson imposed a lockdown to stem the spread of the virus. While outdoor markets and car showrooms reopened on June 1, Monday will be the big return to business for retailers.It only applies to England, with stores in Scotland and Wales waiting for guidance from their devolved administrations on when they can resume trading. Non-essential stores in Northern Ireland reopened on Friday.Getting shoppers spending again is key to Britain’s recovery after official data on Friday showed the economy shrank by a quarter over March and April.The British Retail Consortium reckons the lockdown has cost non-food stores $2.3 billion a week in lost revenues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-s-shops-reopen-today-as-lockdown-eases-massive-discounts-on-offer-to-offload-15-billion-unsold-stock/story-FFdwtMlgMpRv3S1hajLBBN.html

15-06-2020||World||2 Sydney statues of British explorer James Cook vandalised||An Australian state government leader said on Monday she was considering tougher laws to protect monuments after two statues of British explorer James Cook were vandalised in Sydney.Two women were charged with defacing a statue with spray paint in downtown Hyde Park over Saturday night. Another statue was discovered spray painted in the eastern suburb of Randwick on Sunday morning in an unrelated attack, police said.Cities around the world are taking steps to remove statues that represent cultural or racial oppression.New South Wales Premier Gladys Berejiklian said she would consider toughening laws to deter future vandalism.“I wish it didn’t come to this and I want to stress that it’s only a very, very small percentage of the population that’s engaging in this activity, the vast majority of us don’t condone it, we think it’s disrespectful, it’s un-Australian,” she told reporters.Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week apologised for words he used last week to reject calls for his Sydney electoral district of Cook to be renamed.Cook came ashore in the district in 1770 in what was to become the site of the first British colony in Australia.Morrison apologised for saying Australia has been colonised without slavery after critics pointed out that tens of thousands of South Pacific islanders had been forced to labour on Australian sugar cane plantations in the 19th century and Australian indigenous people had been forced to work for wages that were never paid.A part-time employee of the minor Greens party, Xiaoran Shi, 28, and her alleged accomplice Charmaine Morrison-Mills, 27, were released on bail from a Sydney court on Sunday on charges of damaging property and possessing a graffiti implement over the Hyde Park statue.Greens state lawmaker David Shoebridge, for whom Shi works, said he was aware of the allegations.“They were not engaged in employment at the time of the incident which occurred well outside of work hours,” Shoebridge said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-sydney-statues-of-british-explorer-james-cook-vandalised/story-1rcSuZUTEodMl49Ti8nPzJ.html
15-06-2020||World||Tokyo sees most coronavirus cases since May 5 as it eases restrictions||Tokyo disclosed 47 new coronavirus cases on Sunday, the highest since May 5, as the capital eases restrictions and readies to fully reopen the economy.Thirty-two of the cases were traced to nightclubs and bars, a spokeswoman for the Tokyo Metropolitan Government said by phone, with 18 of them coming from a single business establishment in Shinjuku, which houses the city’s most well-known entertainment and red-light district. It is yet to be determined where 10 other people contracted the virus. The surge was the result of more proactive testing, Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told reporters Sunday.The jump comes as the Tokyo government is planning to lift all business restrictions on Friday, which would allow nightclubs and live music venues to reopen. While many firms have voluntarily complied with requests to close, with authorities lacking the ability to enforce requests, some establishments continued to operate during the pandemic.The increase also comes days after the capital entered its final reopening phase and lifted the “Tokyo Alert,” which was issued to urge greater vigilance amid a rebound in cases after a state of emergency ended May 25.“I’d like to deal with it positively,” said Yasutoshi Nishimura, economy and fiscal policy minister, about the case spike at a press conference Sunday, with businesses being cooperative and measures taken to prevent a second wave of infections.On Saturday, Nishimura announced a new policy at nightclubs and bars to contain the spread, according to Nikkei. It reported the policy will include customers being separated from each other and their contact information being checked.As Japan’s economy gradually restarts, Nishimura told NHK on Sunday morning that the government will push for digitalization and support employment with subsidies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-sees-most-coronavirus-cases-since-may-5-as-it-eases-restrictions/story-9abfHbatWiTogXl7TqL0pK.html
15-06-2020||World||Deaths of black men in Georgia, California prompt protests||A makeshift memorial popped up Sunday at a fast-food restaurant where a black man was fatally shot by a white Atlanta police officer, one of the latest deaths of black men that have ignited a new wave of anti-racism protests across the country.Demonstrations also erupted over the weekend in Palmdale, California, where hundreds demanded an investigation into the death of Robert Fuller, 24, a black man found hanging from a tree earlier Wednesday near city hall.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageEarly Sunday, Atlanta police announced that an officer, Garrett Rolfe, had been fired following the fatal shooting of Rayshard Brooks, 27, on Friday night, and another officer, Devin Brosnan, had been placed on administrative duty. On Saturday, Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms had called for the immediate firing of the officer who opened fire on Brooks and announced that she had accepted the resignation of Police Chief Erika Shields.“I do not believe that this was a justified use of deadly force,” Bottoms said.Roughly 150 protesters marched outside the Wendy’s restaurant outside where Brooks was shot, reigniting demonstrations that had largely simmered in the Georgia capital nearly three weeks after George Floyd, another black man, died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee to his neck. Both Rolfe and Brosnan are white.The Wendy’s was set aflame at one point Saturday night, although the fire was out before midnight. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said that Brooks, who was seen on body camera video sleeping in a car blocking the Wendy’s drive thru, failed a sobriety test and was shot in a struggle over a police Taser.Atlanta police said Sunday that 36 people had been arrested in connection with the protests, but gave no further details.In California, authorities said Fuller’s death appeared to be a suicide, but an autopsy was planned. The city said there were no outdoor cameras that could have recorded what happened.Fuller’s death has brought to light the death of another black man found hanging from a tree on May 31 in Victorville, a desert city 45 miles (72 kilometers) east of Palmdale. A sheriff’s spokeswoman, Jodi Miller, told Victor Valley News foul play was not suspected in 38-year-old Malcolm Harsch’s death but the man’s family said they were concerned it will be ruled a suicide to avoid further attention.Meanwhile, the rapidly unfolding movement to take down Confederate statues in the U.S. grew over the weekend. In Richmond, Virginia, a police SUV drove up on a curb and struck multiple protesters who were blocking the vehicle’s path during a demonstration Saturday night at the Robert E. Lee statue, which has become a gathering place for racial justice demonstrations.The Richmond Times-Dispatch reports that no one appeared to be seriously injured. In messages posted on Twitter early Sunday morning, the Richmond Police Department said police are investigating the incident, including what it called “a possible assault” on an officer who was inside the vehicle. The department said it is also investigating reports on social media “that a person in the crowd may have been struck by the vehicle.” Spokespersons for the department did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment Sunday morning.In Philadelphia, a group of about 100 people, some carrying guns and baseball bats, gathered around a statue of Christopher Columbus in Philadelphia on Saturday, saying they intended to protect it from vandals amid recent protests.“It would be over my dead body before they got to this statue,” Anthony Ruggiero, 41, told The Philadelphia Inquirer. “This is a part of history.” Mayor Jim Kenney condemned the “groups of armed individuals ‘protecting’” the statue in a Twitter post on Sunday.Meanwhile, three people were charged in the vandalism of a Christopher Columbus statue in Providence, Rhode Island.Protesters in New Orleans tore down a bust of a slave owner Saturday who left part of his fortune to New Orleans’ schools and then took the remains to the Mississippi River and rolled it down the banks into the water.And in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, the Cherokee Nation’s principal chief watched as two Confederate monuments were removed that were placed in its tribal headquarters nearly a century ago by the Daughters of the Confederacy.Also Saturday, members of the Clemson University football team led hundreds of demonstrators on the school’s campus in South Carolina. The march came a day after Clemson trustees voted to rename its honors college, stripping from the program the name of former vice president and slavery proponent John C. Calhoun.European protesters sought to show solidarity with their American counterparts and to confront bias in their own countries on Sunday.

A total of 743 healthy people ages 18 to 59 either received shots on two schedules or a placebo. More data will be uncovered from another group in the trial that received shots on a 28-day interval. Sinovac plans to publish its results in academic journals, according to a company spokesperson.Using a killed version of the coronavirus, Sinovac’s vaccine is among five Chinese experimental shots that have reached the crucial final stage of human testing before they can be approved for public use. The company announced a partnership this month with Instituto Butantan to conduct its phase III trial in Brazil, where the novel pathogen has caused the second-largest outbreak in a pandemic that so far infected more than 7.7 million people.Since lockdowns and social-distancing measures have helped to keep infection rates low in many countries, some of the world’s leading vaccine efforts are seeking to conduct phase III trial in active outbreaks to evaluate the effectiveness of their shots.Authorities in Brazil have approved the vaccine co-developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc to carry out late stage trials there, while Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc is set to go into phase III trials in the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/90-of-people-given-vaccine-by-sinovac-show-promising-results/story-00KjZxzwe3HOu7bVfO1jRM.html
