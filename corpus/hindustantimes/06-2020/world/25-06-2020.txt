The meeting which was kept under wraps till the meeting day, took place amidst tensions between China and the US on a range of issues. “I met with Yang Jiechi last week in Hawaii. We had a very frank discussion about the Chinese Communist Party’s unprovoked aggression on a number of fronts and I pressed him for more transparency on Covid for the good of the world,” Pompeo told reporters at a press conference on Wednesday. “We’re concerned by Beijing’s behaviour and we’re not the only ones. And he and I talked about that. Our friends and partners are finding their voice and taking action to counter China’s malign activities, particularly in Europe,” he said. President Donald Trump has announced a number of retaliatory measures against China last month, slamming China for imposing a controversial national security law on Hong Kong that undermines the autonomy of the former British territory. The top US diplomat has led Trump administration officials in criticising Beijing for a lack of transparency and disinformation campaign on the coronavirus since it emerged in the central Chinese city of Wuhan. American officials have indicated that Washington intends to punish Beijing over the spread of the pandemic that has hit America, making it the worst affected country with over one lakh deaths. Last week Pompeo criticised the Chinese Army for “escalating” the border tension with India and militarising the strategic South China Sea. He also described the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) as a “rogue actor.” In a scathing attack on the Chinese government, Pompeo said that the Communist Party of China wants to undo all the progress the free world has made through institutions like the NATO and adopt a new set of rules and norms that accommodate Beijing. “The PLA (People’s Liberation Army) has escalated border tensions with India, the world’s most populous democracy. It’s militarising the South China Sea and illegally claiming more territory there, threatening vital sea lanes,” Pompeo said, a day after he expressed deep condolences to India on the death of 20 soldiers in violent clashes with the PLA troops at the Galwan Valley in Ladakh on June 15. China’s official Xinhua news agency reported last week that Yang and Pompeo agreed to take action to implement in earnest the consensus reached by the heads of state of the two countries and maintain contact and communication. Yang conducted in-depth exchanges with Pompeo on China-US relations as well as global and regional issues of mutual concern, the report said. Both sides fully expounded their respective stances and deemed the dialogue to be constructive. They agreed to take action to implement in earnest the consensus reached by the heads of state of the two countries and maintain contact and communication, the report added. Yang is a member of the Politburo of the CPC Central Committee and director of the Office of the Foreign Affairs Commission of the CPC Central Committee. China’s government-controlled media has attacked Pompeo as “evil,” “insane” and an “enemy of mankind” for accusing Beijing for trying to mislead the world about the severity of the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/had-very-frank-discussion-with-china-on-unprovoked-aggression-pompeo/story-URXvGgCe4s2ak2FGRu3ERL.html
25-06-2020||World||UK: India a ‘focus country’ for forced marriages||A dedicated unit dealing with forced marriages in which at least one individual is a British citizen said on Thursday that it recorded less number of cases related to India in 2019 – 65 – compared to those in 2018 (85), but India remains among the UK’s top ‘focus’ countries on this issue. Officials define forced marriage as one in which one or both spouses do not (or, in the case of some adults with learning or physical disabilities or mental incapacity, cannot) consent to the marriage, and violence, threats, or any other form of coercion is involved.Coercion may include emotional pressure, physical force or the threat of it, and financial pressure. In an arranged marriage, by contrast, both parties have consented to the union but can still refuse to marry if they choose to. Forced marriage is a criminal offence in the UK.The Forced Marriages Unit comprising officials from the Foreign Office and the Home Office said the number of cases linked to India in 2019 was 65 cases (5 per cent of the total cases handled during the year).“This is lower than in 2018 when 85 cases were linked to India. There was a higher proportion of older victims as well as male victims compared with other key focus countries. 23% of the cases were linked to London and 89% of the cases related to victims while they were in the UK”, it said.There have been cases of parents taking children on holiday to their countries of origin, and forcing them to marry there against their will.In 2019, the unit gave advice or support in 1,355 cases related to a possible forced marriage. The highest was in relation to Pakistan (559), followed by Bangladesh (144) and India (65). The officials said the statistics represent only the cases that have been reported, adding that forced marriage is a hidden crime and that the figures will not reflect the full scale of the abuse.The unit was established in 2005 to lead on the UK government’s forced marriage policy, outreach and casework. It operates both inside the UK, where support is provided to any individual, and overseas, where consular assistance is provided to British nationals, including dual nationals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-india-a-focus-country-for-forced-marriages/story-wf3NRIHSuWpSvMdmiogB7O.html
25-06-2020||World||The real British cuppa: Envoy deploys military to make tea||Talking about how to make a British cup of tea can be a sensitive issue: it no longer remains just a storm in a teacup when envoys of the United Kingdom and the United States ‘spar’ on the issue, with the former calling in the military to make the point.There are many versions around the world of how to make a perfect cup of tea, but when a young American in London showed hers that involves mixing milk with powdered lemonade, cinnamon, cloves, sugar and Tang, adding a teabag, microwaving it and calling the concoction ‘British tea’, the Brits were rather furious.Tea had a key role in American independence – remember the Boston Tea Party – so the young American’s exertions on social media earlier this month resonated at many levels, prompting the British ambassador to the US to deploy the military to show the world how the perfect cuppa is brewed.“I see there’s huge interest in how to make a British cup of tea. So I’ve called in my military advisers to get this in the record. The Anglo-American relationship is defined by tea. We’ve had a number of requests to show how to make a real cup of tea,” said ambassador Karen Pierce.She followed it up with brief footage of army, navy and air force personnel from the field explaining and showing to make the perfect brew. The army man said with understated contempt: “You don’t need a microwave to make a cup of tea”.Thousands of Brits joined in to offer their views on the subject, many in strong terms.Not to be outdone, the US ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, responded on Wednesday, but he diplomatically side-stepped the issue and showed how he makes coffee, much to the horror of many Britons who prefer the traditional tea.Johnson said on camera from his kitchen: “I’m going to make an American cup of coffee, the way I do it every day. Responding to Ambassador Pierce’s perfect cup of tea and her instructions”, and went on to add boiling water to instant coffee and some milk, calling it “perfect”.Italians who love the Bialetti way of making coffee were not impressed, suggesting that Johnson may have responded to Pierce, but may have opened another front in the brewing storm across the US and Europe.For the record, most of the tea consumed in the UK, US and elsewhere is grown in India, where ‘chai’ is brewed in ways different to that in Britain and is reflected in popular culture and public discourse at many levels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-real-british-cuppa-envoy-deploys-military-to-make-tea/story-CT9onvMASpSv7Qs4DcK0BJ.html

He made the revelation while presenting preliminary findings to parliament of a probe into the May 22 Airbus A320 aircraft crash in Karachi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-airline-says-150-pilots-grounded-after-crash-probe/story-0wNjLCa4Lnh0r26hAemohN.html
25-06-2020||World||‘How to lose an election’: French President Macron gets it all wrong in Paris||President Emmanuel Macron was surveying a glacier in the French Alps on a visit in February when an aide forwarded a video that had just been posted online, showing his choice for Paris mayor masturbating.Benjamin Griveaux’s campaign was already floundering, a month out from the first round of the election, and his naiveté in falling for a simple sting meant Macron had to choose: back a loyal and trusted ally, or sack him.“Be there for him,” Macron told advisers, according to a member of his inner circle. “And if he decides to press on, circle the wagons.”Macron has consistently rewarded the early backers of his 2017 bid for the presidency, party insiders say. But within 48 hours, Griveaux had stood down, leaving Macron’s hopes of winning the capital in tatters.Interviews with more than a dozen ministers, presidential aides and party insiders who spoke on condition of anonymity reveal how miscalculations cost him dear, and portray a leader who can put loyalty before competence and fail to judge character.Macron had hoped that local elections would provide the grassroots base that his young centrist party, LaRem, lacks ahead of his 2022 re-election bid.And Paris’s City Hall, long in the grip of the left, seemed there for the taking.The capital welcomed the former investment banker into the Elysee Palace with open arms in 2017. One in three Parisian voters backed LaRem in last year’s European elections.And a year ago, before Griveaux’s nomination, incumbent Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo was deeply unpopular for her efforts to reduce traffic in the capital, and surveys showed a Macron candidate beating her.TURNING GOLD TO LEADNow, three days before Sunday’s nationwide municipal elections, Macron’s stand-in candidate, former health minister Agnes Buzyn, is polling more than 20 points behind Hidalgo, seemingly having lost ground since the first round in March.One disgruntled LaRem lawmaker put it simply: “We had gold in our hands and we turned it to lead.”LaRem’s campaign crumbled with the sting on Griveaux, but the seeds of defeat had been sown months earlier, with Griveaux’s selection.The 42-year-old was one of the ‘Macron Boys’, the clique that helped propel the president to power. In July 2019, a LaRem committee picked him over Cedric Villani, an eccentric maths genius known for his spider brooches and silk cravats.But many saw Griveaux, who served as Macron’s first government spokesman, as arrogant and patronising.When the video was posted - by a Russian protest artist whose girlfriend had lured Griveaux into sending the video - few in the party rallied round him. “He wasn’t liked. Neither by the public, nor by party members,” said an official inside LaRem. “The time has come when you have to say it like it is.”MATHS MAVERICKTo be sure, Macron’s own popularity had slumped during months of anti-government ‘yellow vest’ protests in early 2019, which were driven by public anger at a leader seen as aloof. It fell again last winter during weeks of demonstrations against pension reforms, and transport strikes.But Macron’s confidant compared the loyalty to Griveaux to an alliance forged in war.“It’s like (French wartime resistance leader) De Gaulle and the Communists: They had nothing in common but, 20 years later, once he was in the Elysee, the General still took calls from those who had been with him in London.”Macron also underestimated Villani, winner of a Fields Medal, mathematics’ equivalent of a Nobel Prize.Villani had entered politics, and parliament, in 2017 with LaRem but, after being rejected as its mayoral candidate, decided to run as an independent, and ate into Griveaux’s support.Party officials urged Macron to offer Villani an incentive to drop his maverick campaign, reminiscent of Macron’s own rise to power, or eject him from the party.But the president held back, telling a small group of reporters that “emulation” was a positive. Socialist and conservative rivals gleefully pointed to the disunity.Two sources close to Macron said he had believed Villani’s bid would naturally fade. It was only in January, when Griveaux slipped to third in surveys, with Villani further behind, that Macron summoned the mathematician. Even then, he failed to change Villani’s mind.As one government minister put it: “We’ve done almost everything we shouldn’t have done. It could end up as a handy guide: ‘How to lose an election’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-to-lose-an-election-french-president-macron-gets-it-all-wrong-in-paris/story-T8XZFZuEor4Hq3Fbj9k0CM.html
25-06-2020||World||‘Over 30% of pilots in Pakistan have fake licenses, not qualified to fly’: Pak aviation minister||More than 30 percent of civilian pilots in Pakistan, roughly 1 in every 3, are not qualified to fly and have fake licenses, aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan said on Wednesday as reported by CNN. While addressing the national assembly, Khan said that over 260 pilots in Pakistan had paid someone else to take exams on their behalf.Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) has grounded all its pilots with fake licenses with immediate effect. The country has over 850 active pilots serving various domestic airlines, including the country’s flagship airline PIA, and other foreign carriers. The findings were revealed after an investigation was led into a PIA plane crash in Karachi last month that killed nearly 100 people. Khan, on Wednesday, told Parliament that the pilots of the PIA plane that crashed on May 22 were not focussed during the flight, news agency PTI reported. He pointed out their “overconfidence and lack of concentration” as some of the reasons for the tragedy that killed 97 people on board. “The pilot ignored the instructions of the air traffic controllers and the ATC, on the other hand, did not inform the pilot about the engine colliding... the pilots were discussing corona throughout the flight. They were not focussed. They talked about corona [...] their families were affected. When the control tower asked him to increase the plane’s height, the pilot said ‘I’ll manage’. There was overconfidence,” Khan told the national assembly on Wednesday while presenting the interim investigation report on the plane crash.The Airbus A320 aircraft from Lahore to Karachi crashed in a residential area near the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on May 22. It was carrying 91 passengers and a crew of eight aboard before it crashed into the Jinnah Garden area near Model Colony in Malir, minutes before landing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-30-of-pilots-in-pakistan-have-fake-licenses-not-unqualified-to-fly-pak-aviation-minister/story-hd6059ghP0kWDrfgsTi6TK.html
25-06-2020||World||‘Cash for favors’ row brings new trouble for UK PM Johnson||A member of Boris Johnson’s government and a “cash for favors” dispute he’s embroiled in has become the latest political headache for the premier after a difficult few months battling the coronavirus pandemic.Housing Secretary Robert Jenrick, under fire since it emerged that he approved a planning development from businessman Richard Desmond who later donated money to the Conservative Party, released documents Wednesday showing he’d exchanged text messages with Desmond prior to the decision.The UK’s main opposition Labour Party described the events as a “cash for favors” scandal. Jenrick told the House of Commons on Wednesday any allegations that his view on the construction project could have been swayed by meeting Desmond were “wrong” and “outrageous,” and said he knew “nothing” of the donation.The closeness of Jenrick’s contact with Desmond adds to the controversy around the episode, which has seen calls for his resignation and risks further damaging the popularity of Johnson’s Conservative Party. Despite winning a strong majority six months ago, the Tories’ poll standing has declined as the the U.K. has recorded one of the highest coronavirus death tolls in the world.Questions over Jenrick’s actions follow the backlash over Johnson’s key aide Dominic Cummings, who was the focus of a media frenzy and became a national talking point after allegedly breaking lockdown rules, as though there’s one rule for the governing elite and another for the masses.Labour accused Jenrick of rushing through approval of Desmond’s project -- a 500-apartment, 44-storey development at Westferry Printworks, a former printing plant in east London -- to help the businessman avoid paying a new community infrastructure levy that was to be imminently introduced. The charge would have cost Desmond at least 30 million pounds ($37 million).DonationA redacted email from a civil servant included in the documents published on Wednesday said Jenrick had been “insistent” on issuing a decision quickly, noting the upcoming tax change.Desmond made a 12,000 pounds donation to the Conservative Party two weeks after Jenrick issued the decision. Jenrick later reversed the decision after the local council sought a judicial review, conceding he had acted unlawfully.“He rushed through the decision specifically to help the developer,” Labour’s Shadow Secretary for Communities and Local Government Steve Reed said in a statement. “The public must be reassured that there is not one rule for the Conservatives and their wealthy donors and another rule for everyone else.”In a sign of Johnson wanting to move on from the Jenrick affair, the U.K.’s top civil servant Mark Sedwill sent Reed a letter on Wednesday stating that the prime minister considers the matter closed.Defending JenrickBusiness Minister Nadhim Zahawi defended Jenrick’s actions.“There is no smoking gun here,” he told the BBC. “The intention was to get more housing built quickly for people that really need it. But when there was a perception of bias, Robert Jenrick pulled this thing and will allow a different minister to decide.”Asked whether Desmond had enjoyed privileged access and what he would say to voters in the north of England who thought this looked unfair, Zahawi replied: “If people go to a fundraiser in their local area, Doncaster, for the Conservative Party they’ll be sitting next to MPs, other people in their local authority. They can interact with different parts of the authority.”Still, he insisted: “The access didn’t buy this billionaire a decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cash-for-favors-row-brings-new-trouble-for-uk-pm-johnson/story-GWF5bR3K18bNCRmGTkJaaI.html

But Oxford and AstraZeneca’s collaborative initiative is not the only one in the race to arrive at a potential Covid-19 vaccine. According to the World Health Organisation’s draft landscape of Covid-19 vaccines, there were 10 candidates in the advanced clinical trials and 115 in preclinical evaluation stages on June 12. On June 22, 13 experimental vaccines were there in clinical trials and another 129 in the preclinical evaluation stage. The latest WHO draft notifies 16 experimental vaccines to be in clinical trials and another 125 in the preclinical evaluation stage as of June 24.CanSino Biological Inc./Beijing Institute of Biotechnology; Moderna/NIAID; Wuhan Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm; Beijing Institute of Biological Products/Sinopharm; Sinovac; Novavax; BioNTech/Fosun Pharma/Pfizer; Institute of Medical Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences; Inovio Pharmaceuticals; Genexine Consortium; Gamaleya Research Institute; Clover Biopharmaceuticals Inc./GSK/Dynavax; Anhui Zhifei Longcom Biopharmaceutical/Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences; Imperial College London and Curevac are 15 other contenders who have their experimental vaccines in the clinical trials phase, WHO’s latest draft landscape states.Spearheading the effort to formulate a Covid-19 vaccine are US-based Moderna Inc. and China’s Sinovac Biotech - both will enter the final stage of trials next month. Beijing-based China National Biotec Group Co. is the latest to receive regulatory approval to conduct phase 3 trials of its Covid-19 vaccines in the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday.Indian companies are also partnering to develop vaccine candidates that are currently in the preclinical trial stages.Serum Institute of India (SII) has partnerships with US-biotech firm Codagenix, Austria’s Themis Bioscience and Oxford-AstraZeneca. Bharat Biotech in Hyderabad is working on three vaccine candidates. Delhi-based Panacea Biotec is partnering with Refana Inc. in the US to develop an inactivated whole virus vaccine.

The EU approval covers Germany’s 300 million-euro equity participation, a 4.7 billion-euro silent participation with features of a non-convertible equity instrument and a 1 billion-euro silent participation with the features of a non-convertible debt instrument.Germany’s bailout for Lufthansa overcame one major roadblock when the airline’s biggest stockholder said he’d vote in favor of the rescue package at a special shareholder meeting later Thursday. He had earlier criticized a steep discount being granted to the German government on a 20% stake, and held the votes to single-handedly stop the share sale.The EU approval comes with tight conditions to ensure the aid is repaid swiftly and Lufthansa doesn’t use taxpayer funding to expand its business. Ryanair Holdings Plc has already threatened legal action against the aid it says unfairly helps Lufthansa over other rivals in Germany.The aid approval doesn’t cover a 3 billion state loan guarantee that the EU says it will handle separately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/business-news/lufthansa-s-6-billion-euro-german-recapitalization-gets-eu-nod/story-2bSvxUbgdbLWnaCWIzCGGJ.html

25-06-2020||World||Vote to extend Putin’s rule faces little protest in Russia||They’ve offered prizes ranging from gift certificates to cars and apartments. They’ve put up billboards and enlisted celebrities to urge a “yes” vote. They’ve encouraged state-run businesses like hospitals and schools to pressure employees to register at the polls.Russian authorities seem to be pulling out all the stops to get people to vote on constitutional amendments that would enable President Vladimir Putin to stay in office until 2036 by resetting the clock on his term limits.The country’s divided opposition, meanwhile, has failed to mobilize a significant protest amid the audacious election campaign and the weeklong voting that begins with early balloting Thursday. Instead, critics are raising questions about the vote’s legitimacy.“Nothing will prevent the Kremlin from getting the formal result they need,” said former Kremlin speechwriter-turned-political analyst Abbas Gallyamov.The amendments include a change in the constitution that would allow the 67-year-old Putin, who has ruled Russia for over two decades, to run for two more six-year terms after his current one expires in 2024. Other amendments talk about improving social benefits and effectively ban same-sex marriage, tapping into the country’s social conservatism and concerns about plummeting incomes.The amendments have already been approved by both houses of parliament, the country’s Constitutional Court and were signed into law by Putin, and the vote is seen as an effort to put a veneer of democracy on the controversial changes. Putin says he’s sure the “absolute majority” of Russians approve of them.According to the Levada independent polling center, 44% of Russians said in late May they would vote “yes,” and 32% would vote “no” but only 25% of the “no” respondents planned to vote.“Those who don’t support the amendments are not mobilized. (They are) demoralized and don’t know what to do,” said Denis Volkov, a sociologist with the Levada Center.The opposition has sent mixed signals. Its best-known figure, Alexei Navalny, has dismissed the vote as illegitimate, saying it doesn’t make sense to participate, even if voting against the amendments.“Do you want to go and vote ‘no’? This strategy seems naive and a bit laughable to me. But if that’s what your heart wants - go and vote ‘no.’ The main thing is to not recognize (the vote’s legitimacy), because it’s a scam,” Navalny said on his YouTube channel.Navalny’s team has backed a strike by election workers who don’t want to risk contracting coronavirus at polling stations. But the strikers admit they haven’t gained much traction -- an open letter has so far gathered a little over 500 signatures. In Moscow alone, there are about 2,000 workers, said Sergei Lebedev, who signed the letter, adding that he had expected more support.“Reporters often ask whether we want to derail the vote. Of course not,” he said, adding he doubted that enough poll workers would strike.The vote was set for April but was postponed due to the pandemic. Putin rescheduled the vote to conclude by July 1, saying that Russia has passed the peak of its outbreak, even as the number of new infections still hovers around 9,000 a day.Some Moscow politicians and journalists launched a “No!” campaign against the amendments, but the virus lockdown prohibited rallies, and authorities have detained even single pickets.Most of the operations took place online. Live YouTube rallies and hashtag campaigns on social media revealed that a significant number of people don’t support the amendments, said Yulia Galyamina, one of the founders of “No!” However, she admitted it could not compete with the Kremlin’s operation.“Society is under the influence of ubiquitous (state) propaganda. We have neither the resources, nor the opportunity, to organize propaganda of this scale,” Galyamina said.The biggest problem vote organizers face is turnout — luring people to the polls after weeks of coronavirus lockdowns and at a time when public support for Putin is dwindling: In April and May, his traditionally high approval ratings reached an all-time low of 59%, according to the Levada Center.Authorities have turned to using incentives. In the Siberian Krasnoyarsk region, a constitutional quiz has been organized — conveniently near polling stations — with top prizes of a car or an apartment. Moscow authorities have allocated 10 billion rubles ($145 million) for gift certificates to shops and restaurants for voters.There also have been appeals to patriotism and even homophobia. One video used gay stereotypes to promote the message that without the amendments, same-sex couples would be able to adopt children.Critics say the way the vote has been organized leaves room for manipulation and fraud. To keep big crowds from forming, polls will be open for seven days through July 1. It’s not clear who will keep an eye on ballot boxes during regular disinfection breaks, when everyone, including poll workers and monitors, must leave the premises.There also will be fewer independent monitors because more bureaucratic hurdles have been added.Online voting has also been allowed in the Moscow and Nizhny Novgorod regions, which have a combined population of nearly 16 million.“The whole procedure from start to finish is aimed at covering up rigging, which will be very convenient to carry out,” says Grigory Melkonyants, co-chair of the independent election monitoring group Golos.Critics say those tactics reflect the government’s struggle to mobilize supporters. They note that social media posts from celebrities supporting the amendments have been flooded with comments against them.The opposition has shifted its focus to exposing potential vote fraud.

The main opposition National Party was on 38%, up from 29%, after it changed its leader. The election will be held Sept. 19.Ardern’s support may have been hurt by recent revelations that New Zealand’s border controls have been too lax, allowing two women with Covid-19 to exit quarantine early to attend a family funeral without being tested. National’s change of leader to Todd Muller from Simon Bridges is also helping to rekindle its support.Still, if the poll results were replicated on election night Ardern’s party could govern alone. That is an unlikely outcome in New Zealand’s proportional representation electoral system, which lends itself to coalition governments.Labour’s current coalition partner New Zealand First was on 2%, well below the 5% required to return to parliament. However, its ally the Green Party was on 6%, giving the center-left a robust margin over the center-right.The poll was conducted June 20-24 and had a margin of error of 3.1%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-s-jacinda-ardern-holds-big-poll-lead-as-election-looms/story-ma9E1J4zA9avazWe6smXyI.html
25-06-2020||World||Japan confirms plans to cancel deployment of US missile defence system||Japan’s National Security Council has endorsed plans cancel the deployment of two costly land-based US missile defence systems aimed at bolstering the country’s capability against threats from North Korea, the country’s defence minister said Thursday.The council made its decision Wednesday, and now the government will need to enter negotiations with the US. about what to do with payments and the purchase contract already made for the Aegis Ashore systems.The council is expected to also revise Japan’s basic defence plan later this year to update the missile defence program and scale up the country’s defence posture.Defence Minister Taro Kono announced the plan to scrap the systems earlier this month after it was found that the safety of one of the two planned host communities could not be ensured without a hardware redesign that would be too time consuming and costly.The Japanese government in 2017 approved adding the two Aegis Ashore systems to enhance the country’s current defenses consisting of Aegis-equipped destroyers at sea and Patriot missiles on land.Defence officials have said the two Aegis Ashore units could cover Japan entirely from one station at Yamaguchi in the south and another at Akita in the north.The plan to deploy the two systems already had faced a series of setbacks, including questions about the selection of one of the sites, repeated cost estimate hikes that climbed to 450 billion yen ($4.1 billion) for their 30-year operation and maintenance, and safety concerns that led to local opposition.Kono said Japan has signed contract worth nearly half the total cost and paid part of it to the U.S.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has steadily pushed to step up Japan’s defence capability, said last week that in light of the scrapping the government would need to reconsider Japan’s missile defence program and do more under the country’s security alliance with the US.Abe said the government would consider the possibility of acquiring pre-emptive strike capability, a controversial plan that critics say would violate Japan’s war-renouncing Constitution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-confirms-plans-to-cancel-deployment-of-us-missile-defence-system/story-EOmkAqLBBK4rEqqy8fqZnK.html

Allowing Vietnamese people to work abroad will also be watched closely.“There is no story of rushing to open the doors,” Phuc said, adding that those allowed to enter Vietnam must continue to adhere to isolation requirements.Vietnam said earlier this month that it is considering the resumption of some international flights to and from destinations that have had no novel coronavirus cases in the past 30 days, according to a statement on the government’s website. Officials have also discussed some flights between Vietnam and countries such as China, South Korea and Japan.Vietnam’s aviation authority has cautioned against the gradual resumption of international flights until the fourth quarter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-s-pm-says-nation-is-in-no-rush-to-open-its-doors/story-eWTfb2V4uZw6fFXpjSyt6O.html
25-06-2020||World||With a jab at Donald Trump, Nancy Pelosi unveils new ‘Obamacare’ bill||Flicking a dismissive jab at president Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi unveiled a plan Wednesday to expand “Obamacare,” even as Trump’s administration is about to file arguments in a Supreme Court case to strike it down.Pelosi announced an upcoming floor vote on her measure, setting up a debate that will juxtapose the Democrats’ top policy issue, Trump’s unrelenting efforts to dismantle Obama’s legacy, and the untamed coronavirus pandemic.On Thursday, the Trump administration is expected to file papers with the Supreme Court arguing that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional.Pelosi wants her bill on the House floor Monday. Trying to overturn a health insurance expansion providing coverage to about 20 million people “was wrong any time,” Pelosi said.“Now, it is beyond stupid,” she added. “Beyond stupid.” Covid-19 cases are rising in major states like Texas, Florida and California, and millions of workers who have lost coverage in the economic shutdown to contain the virus can rely on the health law as a backup.The White House said Pelosi is just playing politics. “Instead of diving back into partisan games, Democrats should continue to work with the president on these important issues and ensuring our country emerges from this pandemic stronger than ever,” spokesman Judd Deere said Wednesday in a statement.Pelosi’s legislation has no chance in the Republican-controlled Senate. Her bill would expand subsidies, allowing more people to qualify for coverage under the ACA.It would financially squeeze some states that have refused to expand Medicaid under the health law.And it would empower Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices — a position Trump once favoured but later abandoned.It would also undo the Trump administration’s expansion of short-term insurance plans that don’t have to cover preexisting medical conditions, something Democrats say will undermine a central achievement of the ACA.Democrats won control of the House in 2018 on their defense of the health care law. Since then, that chamber has voted on most of the measures in Pelosi’s plan in one form or another.But, as underscored in a memo last month led by Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Cheri Bustos, D-Ill., the broader goal is to make Republicans squirm.“Republicans at all levels own this lawsuit’s attack on Americans’ health care,” said the memo.“They will be held responsible for their party-wide obsession with throwing our health care system into chaos and stripping health care from 20 million Americans during a global pandemic.” Obama’s law has grown more popular since Trump’s unsuccessful effort to repeal it in 2017, when Republicans controlled both the House and Senate.In May, a poll from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation found that 51 per cent of Americans view “Obamacare” favourably while 41 per cent have unfavourable views.An earlier Kaiser poll found also found that nearly 6 in 10 are worried they or someone in their family will lose coverage if the Supreme Court overturns either the entire law or its protections for people with preexisting medical conditions.In the case before the court, Texas and other conservative-led states argue that the ACA was essentially rendered unconstitutional after Congress passed tax legislation in 2017 that eliminated the law’s unpopular fines for not having health insurance, but left in place its requirement that virtually all Americans have coverage.The conservative states argued that elimination of the fines made the law’s so-called individual mandate unconstitutional.US District Judge Reed O’Connor in Texas agreed, adding that the mandate was so central to the law that without it the rest must also fall.The Trump administration’s views on the law have shifted over time, but it has always supported getting rid of provisions that prohibit insurance companies from discriminating against people on account of their medical history.Nonetheless, Trump has repeatedly assured Americans that people with preexisting conditions would still be protected.Neither the White House nor congressional Republicans have specified how. A federal appeals court in New Orleans found the health law’s insurance requirement to be unconstitutional, but made no decision on such popular provisions as protections for people with preexisting conditions, Medicaid expansion and coverage for young adults up to age 26 on their parents’ policies.It sent the case back to O’Connor to determine whether other parts of the law can be separated from the insurance requirement, and remain in place.Democratic-led states supporting the ACA appealed to the Supreme Court. It’s unclear if the court will hear oral arguments before the November election.A decision is unlikely until next year. The court has twice upheld the law, with Chief Justice John Roberts memorably siding with the court’s liberals in 2012, amid Obama’s reelection campaign.The majority that upheld the law twice remains on the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-a-jab-at-donald-trump-nancy-pelosi-unveils-new-obamacare-bill/story-ojfBkjKLlXf1UtFxRU6tfI.html
25-06-2020||World||CEPI finds manufacturing capacity for 4 bn doses of coronavirus vaccines||An influential foundation focused on preparation and response to epidemics that is backing nine potential coronavirus vaccines has identified manufacturers with capacity to produce four billion doses a year, the group’s top manufacturing expert told Reuters.The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI)plans to have two or three manufacturing plants for each vaccine, James Robinson, a longtime biopharma executive leading CEPI’S vast manufacturing push, said in an interview.“Right now, we know we can do the two billion doses that we have as our kind of our minimum target” by the end of 2021, he said. Also Read: Oxford vaccine against Covid-19 in final stage of clinical trialsThe group is planning for eight to 10 regional distribution sites “so that we don’t have to make everything centrally and try and ship it around the world,” he said.Even with no existing approved vaccines, CEPI is already getting manufacturing and supply chains lined up in a quest to ensure coronavirus vaccines are distributed equitably around the globe.The Oslo, Norway-based group is backed by 14 governments, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, and Britain’s Wellcome Trust.CEPI has deployed up to $829 million so far in the search for a COVID-19 vaccine through partnerships with nine developers, with the hope that at least some will be successful.Also Read: Covid-19 updates: South Africa begins first trials for Covid-19 vaccineThey are Inovio Pharmaceuticals Inc, the University of Queensland with CSL Ltd, CureVac, Moderna Inc with U.S. government backing, Novavax Inc, the University of Oxford with AstraZeneca, Clover Biopharmaceuticals, the University of Hong Kong, and a consortium led by Institut Pasteur and including the University of Pittsburgh and Themis Bioscience, which was recently purchased by Merck & Co.Robinson said CEPI has taken initial steps toward securing manufacturing capacity with more than 200 biopharma or sterile vaccine production companies.“Most people don’t believe that four billion is possible. I do,” he said. Robinson, a manufacturing consultant who has worked at some of the world’s biggest vaccine companies including Sanofi and Merck, said his group has done “matchmaking” based on manufacturers’ capabilities and the specific needs of the various vaccines.Effective vaccines are seen as critical to stopping a pandemic that has infected more than 9.3 million people and killed nearly 480,000 globally with little sign of letting up.CEPI is taking care to ensure that the work to produce a vaccine to prevent COVID-19 does not sideline other critical vaccines. That has been a particular concern in less developed countries, Robinson said.‘ALL HAS TO BE BUILT FROM SCRATCH’Manufacturing capacity has been easier to locate for vaccine candidates that employ traditional technology. But three of the candidates CEPI is backing involve more complex mRNA- or DNA-based technology.Since there has never been a licensed vaccine using those approaches, no network of contract manufacturers exists to support high-volume production, Robinson said. “The capacity just isn’t there and it all has to be built from scratch,” he said. Access to medical glass is another known bottleneck. To overcome it, CEPI has purchased enough glass vials for two billion doses and is considering purchasing more.“We don’t want vials to be the reason we don’t have enough vaccine,” he said.CEPI is keeping packaging products it chooses uniform, so it can fill vials and finish packaging for any of the vaccines, rather than tailoring them to individual products. They have done the same with rubber stoppers that seal the vials and aluminum flip caps to cover them.“Some companies are choosing not to use our network ... and they’re also purchasing their own vials,” Robinson said. That will allow more capacity for smaller biotechs and university labs that do not have sophisticated supply chains.One other massive challenge facing CEPI is the need to work with dozens, if not scores, of regulators globally.“Each regulatory agency could ask for something different, so our job is a bit more complex,” Robinson said. A CEPI regulatory working group has been looking into ways to try to standardize requirements to the extent possible, Robinson said. “But then each of the countries that receive the vaccine also need to license it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cepi-finds-manufacturing-capacity-for-4-bn-doses-of-coronavirus-vaccines/story-w9ivn8E6FDE850K2SHjn2I.html

25-06-2020||World||Divided Koreas mark 70 years since war began, but no treaty in sight||Seventy years after the Korean War began, prospects for a peace treaty to officially end the conflict appear as distant as ever, as the two Koreas held low-key commemorations on Thursday amid heightened tension on the peninsula.The 1950-1953 Korean War ended in an armistice rather than a peace treaty, leaving US-led UN forces technically still at war with North Korea. South Korean leaders in 1953 opposed the idea of a truce that left the peninsula divided and were not signatories to the armistice.South Korean veterans of the war were due to gather to commemorate the anniversary, including at one event where US President Donald Trump and other international leaders were expected to deliver video messages.North Korea’s ruling party newspaper ran a front-page commentary calling for people to follow in the footsteps of those who fought to defend the nation.“Several decades have passed, but the danger of war has never left this soil,” the newspaper said, blaming “hostile forces” for seeking to crush North Korea.Two years ago, a flurry of diplomacy and summits between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and the presidents of the United States, South Korea, and China raised hopes that even if the North’s nuclear arsenal was undiminished, the parties might agree to officially end the technical state of war.Those hopes have been dashed, however, with North Korea accusing the United States and South Korea of clinging to hostile policies, and Washington pressing Pyongyang to abandon its growing arsenal of nuclear weapons and long-range missiles.A series of follow-up meetings and working-level talks failed to close the gap between the two old enemies, and North Korea has taken an increasingly confrontational tone, resuming short-range missile launches, blowing up an inter-Korean liaison office and severing communication hotlines with South Korea.On Wednesday, North Korea said it had decided to suspend plans for unspecified military action against South Korea, but warned it to “think and behave wisely”.Historians have estimated the war may have caused as many as 1 million military deaths and killed several million civilians. Thousands of families were divided with little contact as the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) cut the peninsula in two.“The unresolved state of the Korean War has had devastating consequences for Koreans, from the separation of thousands of families to the extreme militarization of the Korean Peninsula,” said Christine Ahn, international coordinator for WomenCrossDMZ, a group that advocates for peace in Korea.Despite misgivings from many in the United States, South Korean officials are pushing more forcefully for an end to the armistice arrangement, saying that it appreciates the role of the United Nations Command, South Korea’s alliance with the United States should evolve with the times.“It is time for Korea to take centre stage in maintaining its own peace and security, by ending the current state of armistice and establishing a permanent peace regime on the Korean peninsula,” South Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Cho Sei-young said on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/divided-koreas-mark-70-years-since-war-began-but-no-treaty-in-sight/story-8Fr9QszNTLvRD3XRFenBpL.html
25-06-2020||World||Democracy under threat during pandemic, global leaders warn||Over 500 political and civil society leaders, Nobel laureates and rights groups, on Thursday warned that some governments were using the coronavirus pandemic to “tighten their grip on power,” undermining democracy and civil liberties.In an open letter signed by former US Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, actor Richard Gere and Nobel Peace Prize laureates Shirin Ebadi, Lech Walesa and Jose Ramos-Horta, among others, the authors called the ongoing pandemic a “formidable global challenge to democracy.”“Democracy is under threat, and people who care about it must summon the will, the discipline, and the solidarity to defend it,” the authors wrote. “At stake are the freedom, health, and dignity of people everywhere.”The letter -- the aim of which is to raise “awareness and mobilise citizens” -- was initiated by the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA).“Just as the pandemic is already having massive economic and social consequences, it is very likely already having very profound political consequences,” Kevin Casas-Zamora, the organisation’s secretary general, told AFP.Stressing that it was still early days and the full impact on democracy would have to be evaluated later, Casas-Zamora noted there were already worrying signs.Casas-Zamora pointed to “cases like Hungary where basically the emergency powers invoked by the government had no expiration date.”Those powers were lifted however by a unanimous vote in parliament on June 16 that took effect the following day.Casas-Zamora pointed also to Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte’s expansion of emergency powers and El Salvador’s use of detention centres as other causes for concern.Noting that emergency powers were a “legitimate part of the arsenal” of democratic governments to deal with exceptional circumstances, Casas-Zamora said the exercise of those powers had to be “proportional to the emergency.” Speaking of how to balance strict measures such as lockdowns with protecting liberties, he noted that it was still hard to gauge exactly which strategy was most efficient.As a result, it was important to not fixate on whether you had the “correct” policy but instead on whether you could adjust that policy. “There’s a greater chance of finding that right balance if you are able to experiment and able to correct and adjust your public policies,” Casas-Zamora said.Another worry was that not only would some governments overreach with their policies, people would also become “numb” to those types of overreaches when gripped by fear of the disease.“A fearful citizenry tolerates that and becomes used to a more constrained space to exercise their fundamental rights,” Casas-Zamora said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democracy-under-threat-during-pandemic-global-leaders-warn/story-s1p8vEJ5mdvStzOVWoRBnJ.html

Speaking to reporters following the weekly meeting of the country’s scientific advisory council, Fahrettin Koca blamed the uptick in cases on widespread complacency and failure to comply with social distancing. “We can say that the numbers are higher than what we anticipated,” Koca said. “We see that many people are under the perception that we have returned to normal. This perception must rapidly be deactivated,” he said. Follow latest updates on coronavirus hereTurkey has witnessed an increase in the daily number of infections after the government authorised cafes, restaurants, gyms, parks, beaches and museums to reopen and eased stay-at-home orders for the elderly and young at the start of June. The country has been registering average daily infections of around 1,260 since June 12, up from around 800 to 900 previously. Koca on Wednesday reported 1,492 new confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the total infections registered in the country since March to 191,657. He also said there were 24 new Covid-19 deaths, taking the total to 5,025. Last week, Koca said the resurgence of cases following the easing of restrictions were within expected limits.

25-06-2020||World||US immigration agency prepares for laying off more than 13k employees||The US agency in charge of processing immigration applications said on Wednesday it was preparing to furlough nearly 70% of its workforce unless it received fresh funding, a move employees say could bring an already backlogged system to a virtual halt.US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) is dependent on fees from new immigration applications for its operations and is facing a historic budget shortfall.Republican President Donald Trump has made cutting legal and illegal immigration a centerpiece of his 2020 re-election campaign. New regulations and a series of executive actions, along with travel restrictions put in place in response to the coronavirus pandemic, have dramatically reduced the number of immigrants coming to the United States. A USCIS spokesperson said in a statement that the agency has already seen a 50% drop in fees since March when most travel and immigration stopped as countries moved to control the spread of coronavirus. USCIS has asked for a $1.2 billion bailout from Congress to avoid the projected staff reductions.“On or before July 2, approximately 13,400 USCIS employees will receive notice that if USCIS must proceed with an administrative furlough, they would be furloughed beginning August 3,” the USCIS spokesperson’s statement said. The furloughs, if implemented, “will for sure cause noticeable delays immediately,” said one USCIS employee who asked not to be named because they were not authorized to speak on the record. “There are already so many backlogs to work through. It’s insane to even contemplate how bad this is going to get.” The staff of the Refugee, Asylum and International Operations division of USCIS was informed in an email seen by Reuters that notices were being sent on July 24 and 25 to approximately 1,500 employees of the 2,200 on staff in that unit. Those kept on would be a “skeleton crew” to “keep the lights on,” the email said.On Monday, Trump signed a presidential proclamation banning entry for several categories of temporary visa holders and extended a ban on some green card applicants, which the administration said would help open more jobs for unemployed Americans. Critics say the measures will hurt the economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-immigration-agency-prepares-for-laying-off-more-than-13k-employees/story-WWFv5vxAJWM3ohf5t2a9FM.html

Health authorities called the case “unheard of.”The triplets, a girl and two boys, were tested four hours after being born at 7-1/2 months last week in the central state San Luis Potosi, health authorities said. Initially, health authorities said the mother was believed to be an asymptomatic carrier of the virus. But her tests later showed that neither she nor the father were infected. “The parents’ results are negative, which catches our attention,” said Monica Rangel, secretary of health for the state, during a news conference on Tuesday.“We specifically requested since yesterday ... that a group of experts investigates the case.”Two of the babies born on June 17 are in good health and show no symptoms of Covid-19, doctors treating the triplets said, while the third one has pneumonia but is in stable condition.Rangel said the triplets will remain hospitalized and under observation.Mexico has reported more than 190,000 coronavirus cases and a total of 23,377 deaths, making it seventh in most virus-related deaths in the world, according to a Reuters tally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/newborn-mexican-triplets-have-coronavirus-but-parents-do-not/story-83GknMghqPCBDCNq1i7ezL.html
25-06-2020||World||Trump administration says Huawei, Hikvision backed by China’s PLA: Report||The Trump administration has determined that top Chinese firms, including telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies and video surveillance company Hikvision, are owned or controlled by the Chinese military, laying the groundwork for new US financial sanctions, according to a document seen by Reuters on Wednesday.A US defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the authenticity of the document and said it had been sent to Congress. Washington placed Huawei on a trade blacklist last year over national security concerns and has led an international campaign to convince allies to exclude it from their 5G networks.The list of 20 companies that Washington alleges are backed by the Chinese military and operate in the United States was first reported by Reuters. It also includes China Mobile Communications Group and China Telecommunications Corp as well as aircraft manufacturer Aviation Industry Corp of China. The designations were drawn up by the Defense Department, which was mandated by a 1999 law to compile a list of Chinese military companies operating in the United States, including those “owned or controlled” by the People’s Liberation Army that provide commercial services, manufacture, produce or export. The Pentagon’s designations do not trigger penalties, but the law says the president may impose sanctions that could include blocking all property of the listed parties.Huawei, Hikvision, China Mobile, China Telecom, AVIC and the Chinese Embassy in Washington did not respond to requests for comment. The Pentagon has come under pressure from lawmakers of both US political parties to publish the list, amid rising tensions between Washington and Beijing over technology, trade and foreign policy.Last September, top US Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer, Republican Senator Tom Cotton and Republican Representative Mike Gallagher penned a letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper raising concerns about Beijing’s enlisting of Chinese corporations to harness emerging civilian technologies for military purposes.“Will you commit to updating and publicly releasing this list as soon as possible?” they asked in the letter.On Wednesday, Cotton and Gallagher praised DOD for releasing the list and urging the president to impose economic penalties against the firms. The White House did not comment on whether it would sanction the companies on the list, but said it saw it as “a useful tool for the US Government, companies, investors, academic institutions, and likeminded partners to conduct due diligence with regard to partnerships with these entities, particularly as the list grows.”The list will likely add to tensions between the world’s two largest economies, which have been at loggerheads over the handling of the coronavirus pandemic and China’s move to impose security legislation on Hong Kong, among multiple points of friction that have worsened this year. Last week, China threatened retaliation after President Donald Trump signed legislation calling for sanctions over the repression of China’s Uighurs.The list “is a start, but woefully inadequate to warn the American people about the state-owned and -directed companies that support the Chinese government and Communist Party’s activities threatening US economic and national security,” Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who sponsored the Uighur bill, said in a statement. SPOTLIGHT ON US TIESThe list will also turn a spotlight on US companies’ ties to the Chinese firms as well as their operations in the United States. In 2012, US-based General Electric Co set up a 50/50 avionics joint venture with AVIC, known as Aviage Systems, to supply equipment for China’s C919 passenger jet. The Defense Department list also includes China Railway Construction Corp, China Aerospace Science and Industry Corp (CASIC), as well as CRRC, the world’s largest maker of passenger trains, which has clinched contracts in Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago and Los Angeles by underbidding rivals.The companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Many of the companies listed are already in the crosshairs of US regulators. Both Huawei and Hikvision were added to a Commerce Department blacklist last year, which forces their US suppliers to seek licenses before selling to them. In April, the US Justice Department and other federal agencies called on the Federal Communications Commission to revoke China Telecom (Americas) Corp’s authorization to provide international telecommunications services to and from the United States. The telecoms regulator rejected a similar request by China Mobile last year that had been pending for years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-says-huawei-hikvision-backed-by-china-s-pla-report/story-ikNTsUdqkoRkqzFxtfkLSM.html
25-06-2020||World||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange accused of conspiring with ‘anonymous’ hackers||WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange conspired with hackers affiliated with the “Anonymous” and “LulzSec” groups, which have been linked to numerous cyber attacks around the world, according to new indictment by the US Justice Department.Assange, who’s detained in the UK on a US extradition request, gave the leader of LulzSec a list of targets to hack in 2012 and told this person that the most influential release of hacked materials would be from the Central Intelligence Agency, National Security Agency or the New York Times, according to a statement Wednesday from the Justice Department.The LulzSec leader was cooperating with the Federal Bureau of Investigation at the time, according to the statement.An Anonymous and LulzSec-affiliated hacker stole emails through a data breach of an American intelligence consulting company that were published in WikiLeaks, according to the statement. Assange indirectly asked that hacker to spam that company again, the US said.The indictment released Wednesday doesn’t add new charges against Assange but broadens the conspiracy allegations against him, according to the Justice Department. The indictment continues to allege that Assange conspired with Army Intelligence Analyst Chelsea Manning to crack a password hash to a classified US Department of Defense computer, the US said.The US has charged Assange with endangering national security by conspiring to obtain and disclose classified information.

Such a proposal as an amendment to the Great American Outdoors Act moved by Senator Mike Enzi is aimed to generate the much-needed fund required to maintain and upgrade several of the top monuments and national parks in the US. To address the current maintenance backlog of parks, it would cost nearly USD 12 billion, according to National Park Service. In comparison, last year, the entire budget for the National Park Service was USD 4.1 billion. The amendment is completely offset and provides a permanent solution, the Senator said. “The way that my amendment works is by asking our foreign visitors, who as the numbers show are increasingly enjoying our parks, to pay USD 16 or USD 25 more when entering the country,” Enzi said. According to a study by US Travel Association, nearly 40 per cent of people who come to the US from abroad are visiting one of the national parks. That’s over 14 million people who come from abroad and visit national parks, he said. “It’s great that people from all over the world recognise the value in these national treasures, but this increased visitation is adding to the maintenance backlog and it is only fair that we ask them to help maintain these national treasures,” he said. Enzi said that there was nothing novel about the concept as anyone who has visited an attraction outside the US has probably encountered such fees in one way or another. “For example, foreign visitors at the Taj Mahal in India will pay an USD 18 fee, compared to a fee of only 56 cents for local visitors. At Kruger National Park in South Africa, visitors from outside the country will pay a USD 25 fee per day, compared to a USD 6.25 fee for local visitors,” Enzi said. Many European countries like Spain, France, and Italy charge a tourist tax on hotels rooms that is used to pay for tourism infrastructure, he added. Enzi proposed to increase the domestic fee as well. “No one likes to pay more for things, especially during times like these, but to maintain these national treasures for future generations, we either borrow money and put it on the national credit card or we take some modest steps to address the issues responsibly,” he said. “My amendment only raises entrance fee by USD 5 and annual passes by USD 20, so bringing a vehicle into a park would still be cheaper than taking a family of four to a movie or visiting an amusement park for a day,” Enzi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senator-seeks-entry-fee-hike-for-national-parks-draws-analogy-to-taj-mahal/story-qaW34B05fSaunqm0JrHmmI.html
25-06-2020||World||UK government advised to harness Covid-19 pandemic to speed zero-carbon aims||From creating jobs in home insulation to hiking dirty fuel taxes and expanding electric-vehicle charging, Britain’s government should harness the Covid-19 pandemic to accelerate cuts in planet-heating emissions, an advisory panel said on Thursday.With public support for low-carbon shifts growing and the state spending billions to boost its flagging economy, now is “a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity” to ramp up the transition, said John Gummer, chair of Britain’s Committee on Climate Change.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“If we are to emerge successfully from Covid-19, there is only one route and that route is one that enables us also to fight climate change,” said the head of the independent advisory body, which released its annual progress report on Thursday.That document said Britain was moving toward its commitment, made a year ago, to produce no more emissions than it can offset or store by 2050 - but steps so far “do not yet measure up to the size of the net-zero challenge”.To speed up action, the government should use the coronavirus crisis - including fresh public concern about unexpected risks and willingness to change behaviour - to push ahead on new climate-smart policies, the report said.Those should include retrofitting homes and buildings to make them more energy-efficient, which would provide work in all regions, it noted, as well as strengthening the electricity supply network to support increased use of renewable power.The country’s emerging electric-vehicle charging network should be rapidly expanded, and only new vehicles that are zero emissions sold by 2032, it said. Work on flood defences, as climate risks rise, should also be brought forward, it urged.Efforts to train workers for low-carbon jobs, to ensure a fair green transition, should be a priority, along with protecting nature through more forest protection and tree planting, and better managing agricultural land, it added.Even improving Britain’s broadband network - to enable more people to work at home - could have big climate benefits, said Chris Stark, chief executive of the Committee on Climate Change.And hiking fossil fuel taxes now while oil prices are low could raise $15 billion over the next decade in badly needed new tax revenue - and help push people towards low-carbon alternatives, he said.“We are not short of ideas of what can be done here,” Stark told an online briefing, noting many of the proposed changes “stack up on straight economic grounds” as well as making sense for climate action.Renewable power - in large part from offshore wind - is now the cheapest electricity option in Britain, he said, one reason the country’s emissions dropped by more than 3% last year even as global emissions continued to rise.With Britain moving to the final stage of leaving the European Union at the end of 2020, clean power could be one pillar of its new post-Brexit identity, he said.“We’re almost at the point where you can envision an energy system based on renewables, especially wind, and no one blinks when you say it. It’s absolutely amazing,” he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an interview.‘WIN-WIN’Adair Turner, a senior fellow at the Institute for New Economic Thinking, a New York-based think-tank, said government spending on things from renewable energy to home retrofits and tree planting could quickly create jobs while curbing emissions.“This is a clear win-win opportunity which must be seized,” he said in a statement.Camilla Toulmin, a senior associate with the London-based International Institute for Environment and Development, said Britain - host of the delayed COP26 U.N. climate talks - could not afford “a slowdown or delay to climate action in 2020”.Climate impacts are being felt both abroad and in Britain, she said in a statement, noting that despite the global pandemic “the climate crisis has not stopped”.Climate activist group Extinction Rebellion said some of its members planned to protest on Thursday at the Treasury in London against what they saw as “criminal inaction” by the government so far toward achieving its net-zero goal.That goal was enshrined in law last year following large-scale street protests and other civil disobedience by the grassroots movement and other climate campaign groups. The Committee on Climate Change report draws on recommendations made by the Climate Assembly UK, a citizen panel set up by several parliamentary committees with members selected to reflect the demographics of Britain’s diverse population.Nearly 80% of the assembly’s 108 members agreed in a secret ballot that government steps to boost the economy after Covid-19 should be designed to help achieve Britain’s net-zero target.And almost all - 93% - agreed that, as the virus lockdown eases, the state, employers and others should encourage shifts in lifestyles to become more compatible with reaching net-zero.Gummer said Committee on Climate Change members hoped the government would rapidly turn many of their recommendations into policy that is then quickly put into practice.“What we don’t want from the government is a lot of good-hearted statements (and) the beginnings of policies that are not being implemented,” he said.Changes in the law often take several years to take effect, but with climate threats surging and the country’s zero-carbon deadline drawing closer, “we haven’t got five years”, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-advised-to-harness-covid-19-pandemic-to-speed-zero-carbon-aims/story-BNGUcAMpmYCjIkDMKIbuzH.html

This represents a doubling of the previous reward of up to USD 5 million announced in August 2019.Al-Mawla -- also known as Hajji Abdallah and Abu-’Umar al-Turkmani -- succeeded Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi as the leader of ISIS following Baghdadi’s death during a US military operation in October 2019. Al-Mawla helped drive and justify the abduction, slaughter, and trafficking of members of Yazidi religious minority groups in northwest Iraq, and he oversees the group’s global operations.Born in Mosul, Iraq, in 1976, al-Mawla was a religious scholar in ISIS’s predecessor organization, al-Qaida in Iraq, and steadily rose through the ranks of ISIS to become the deputy emir.On March 18, 2020, the Department of State designated al-Mawla, as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist (SDGT).As a result of this designation, US persons are generally prohibited from engaging in any transactions with al-Mawla, and al-Mawla’s property and interests in property subject to US jurisdiction will be blocked. In addition, it is a crime to knowingly provide, or attempt or conspire to provide material support or resources to ISIS.

25-06-2020||World||Europe on track to reopen borders by July 1, US citizens likely to be left out||Americans are unlikely to be allowed into more than 30 European countries for business or tourism when the continent begins next week to open its borders to the world, due to the spread of the coronavirus and President Donald Trump’s ban on European visitors.More than 15 million Americans are estimated to travel to Europe each year, and such a decision would underscore flaws in the Trump administration’s handling of the pandemic, which has seen the United States record the highest number of infections and virus-related deaths in the world by far.European nations appear on track to reopen their borders between each other by July 1. Their representatives in Brussels have been debating what virus-related criteria should apply when lifting border restrictions to the outside world, which were imposed in March to stop all non-essential travel to Europe.In recommendations to EU nations on June 11, the European Commission said “travel restrictions should not be lifted as regards third countries where the situation is worse” than the average in the 27 EU member countries plus Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway and Switzerland.That is likely to rule out people living in the United States, where new coronavirus infections have surged to the highest level in two months, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. After trending down for well over a month, new US cases have risen for more than a week.The US on Tuesday reported 34,700 new cases of the virus, bringing its total to more than 2.3 million cases and over 121,000 dead. The virus outbreaks in Brazil, India and Russia are remarkably high too, and it’s also unlikely that the EU will let their citizens in.In contrast, aside from a notable new outbreak tied to a slaughterhouse in western Germany, the virus’s spread has slowed across the EU and particularly in the 26 nations that make up Europe’s visa-free travel zone known as the Schengen area.For the EU’s executive arm, the key criteria for opening up to the outside world should include the number of new infections per 100,000 population — the exact ceiling is up for debate — and the country’s overall response to the pandemic, in terms of testing, surveillance, treatment, contact tracing and reporting cases.EU envoys are trying to agree on objective, scientific criteria so the decision to put a country on the admission list or not is based on facts and not political considerations. Southern European countries like Spain, Italy and Greece are desperate for tourists to return and breathe new life into their virus-ravaged economies.The bloc aims to revise the list of countries allowed to enter every two weeks based on developments, with new countries joining or possibly even denied access to Europe depending on the spread of the disease. The commission hopes that exemptions can be given to foreign students, non-EU citizens who live in Europe and certain highly skilled workers.But more than epidemiological criteria, any country being considered would first be expected to lift its own travel restrictions for people from all EU and Schengen nations, the commission said, adding “it cannot be applied selectively.” Brussels fears that opening up to countries outside in ad hoc way could lead to the reintroduction of border controls between nations inside the Schengen area, threatening once again Europe’s cherished principle of free movement, which allows people and goods to cross borders without checks.This principle of reciprocity on its own should rule out US citizens, at least initially.In a March 11 decree, Trump suspended the entry of all people from the Schengen area. More than 10 million Europeans usually visit the United States each year.“The potential for undetected transmission of the virus by infected individuals seeking to enter the United States from the Schengen area threatens the security of our transportation system and infrastructure and the national security,” Trump’s proclamation said.A top French diplomat, speaking anonymously in line with the French presidency’s customary practices, stressed that the EU decision will not be a political one.“It will be made on a basis as objective as possible which is the spreading of the virus,” the diplomat said.The official also stressed that Trump “has taken very early measures consisting in preventing people coming from China, then EU countries, from entering the US.” The EU commission also wants the bloc to be open as soon as possible after July 1 to the Balkans region, including citizens from Albania, Bosnia, Kosovo, Montenegro, North Macedonia and Serbia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-on-track-to-reopen-borders-by-july-1-us-citizens-likely-to-be-left-out/story-47fVcJuFvOC7kWa7RmdjqL.html

Remdesivir has made great strides in its role in the formulation of a vaccine against the contagion. Here are the latest development on Covid-19 vaccine and treatment:• The University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc.’s experimental vaccine, ChAdOx1 nCoV-19, is the first to enter the final stages of clinical trials. If the trial is successful, the Oxford Vaccine Group expects to launch the Covid-19 vaccine by the end of this year, • The first clinical trial of Covid-19 vaccine developed by the Oxford University begins in South Africa. • A Chinese military research institute has been approved to test its second experimental coronavirus vaccine in humans, the eighth Chinese candidate in clinical trials.• Experts believe that Patanjali Ayurved Ltd’s claim of a breakthrough cure for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) needs vetting. •The UK has started immunisation of about 300 people with a new coronavirus vaccine as part of a trial led experts at Imperial College London.• The Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) - an influential foundation focused on preparation and response to epidemics - has identified manufacturers with capacity to produce four billion doses of Covid-19 a year.

25-06-2020||World||Canada confronts racism in police in wake of indigenous deaths||As Americans protest the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and other black people at the hands of police, Canadians are facing a reckoning of their own.Since April, six indigenous people have been fatally shot by police, including a woman killed during a “wellness check,” and a video went viral of a First Nations chief being beaten by Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) officers in March.Race troubles in Canadian policing have been thrust into the spotlight in recent weeks, following the global Black Lives Matters protests and the succession of cases of police violence against indigenous people.“There is systemic racism in Canada,” said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau at a news conference this month, calling for investigations into the recent cases to be made public.“It means that indigenous peoples, black Canadians and racialized Canadians are far more likely to suffer violence at the hands of the authorities and police than non-racialized Canadians,” he said.In the decade spanning 2007 to 2017, indigenous people accounted for more than a third of people shot to death by RCMP officers, despite numbering just 5% of the population.A study in Nova Scotia found black residents were six times more likely to be subjected to street checks than were white people.Among those slain since April, Chantel Moore was killed in New Brunswick after police were called to her apartment to check on her well-being.Police say she attacked an officer with a knife, but her family questioned why non-lethal force was not used to subdue her.A week later, Rodney Levi was shot and killed when the RCMP were called to remove him from a church minister’s barbecue and said he was carrying knives.The chief of his indigenous community said on Facebook that Levi had mental health issues.In Alberta, video footage showed Athabasca Chipewyan First Nations Chief Allan Adam being punched, tackled and choked during his arrest over an expired license plate.RCMP Commissioner Brenda Lucki released a statement acknowledging “systemic racism” in the police force, after initially refusing to use the term.The RCMP is omnipresent, operating federally across the country and also contracted to serve by eight out of ten provinces, the three territories and 153 municipalities.As in the United States, calls are growing to demilitarize police and reallocate funds to community-oriented supports such as mental health and housing.“We need to figure out how we deconstruct that combative and aggressive culture that exists within police forces,” said Chief Arlen Dumas, Grand Chief of the Assembly of Manitoba Chiefs.Dumas advocates police body cameras and an emphasis on de-escalation of potentially violent confrontations.Other recommendations being considered include installing veteran detectives and specialized indigenous policing units.Officers frequently work with indigenous communities for only two years and don’t speak the language, said Rebecca Kudloo, president of Pauktuutit Inuit Women of Canada, an advocacy organization.Recently publicized letters of complaint from a legal aid board found women in the territory suffered violence and racism at the hands of the RCMP. In the letters obtained by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the board said indigenous women were forced to undergo “humiliating and degrading” strip-searches by RCMP officers.The RCMP in Nunavut said its commanding officer was aware of the complaints and was awaiting completion of a review into the allegations.Relations between the RCMP and indigenous communities can be traced to its origins as a paramilitary colonial force in the 1870s, said Steve Hewitt, senior history lecturer at the University of Birmingham.“Mounties” moved indigenous people forcibly onto reservations and removed indigenous children from their families to attend residential schools, a policy intended to assimilate them into Euro-Canadian culture.Hewitt suggested starting over, as in Northern Ireland where the sectarian Royal Ulster Constabulary was replaced by a new police force to help ease partisan troubles.“I just think the whole thing is rotten to the core,” he said.Former RCMP officer Chad Haggerty told the Thomson Reuters Foundation that when he was on the force in Alberta, insults by colleagues about indigenous people like himself were “as common as coffee.”One officer said “I was hired because I was an Indian and I should be back on the reserve policing,” said Haggerty, who served for 17 years and works at a law firm. In Manitoba, a law-enforcement program at the University College of the North is trying to get more indigenous people into policing and teach approaches such as community problem-solving.“When you put that uniform on, it represents a lot of things that First Nations people don’t agree with,” said Chris Pallan, an indigenous former RCMP officer who runs the program.He recalled a community elder calling police “the people that take our children away.”“People don’t forget that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-confronts-racism-in-police-in-wake-of-indigenous-deaths/story-HSNnQCFB4bKoteKvKCuU4M.html

25-06-2020||World||‘Coming back and biting us’: US sees Covid-19 make a comeback||Hospital administrators and health care experts warned desperately Wednesday that parts of the US are on the verge of becoming overwhelmed by a resurgence of the coronavirus, lamenting that politicians and a tired-of-being-cooped-up public are letting a disaster unfold.The US recorded a one-day total of 34,700 new Covid-19 cases, just short of the nation’s late-April peak of 36,400, according to the count kept by Johns Hopkins University.While new cases have been declining steadily in early US hot spots such as New York and New Jersey, several other states set single-day case records this week, including Arizona, California, Mississippi, Nevada and Texas. Some of them also broke hospitalization records, as did North Carolina and South Carolina.“People got complacent,” said Dr Marc Boom, CEO of the Houston Methodist hospital system. “And it’s coming back and biting us, quite frankly.” The stock market slid sharply Wednesday as the virus’s resurgence clouded investors’ hopes for a relatively quick economic turnaround. The virus in the U.S. has been blamed for over 120,000 deaths — the highest toll in the world — and over 2.3 million confirmed infections.Florida’s single-day count of new confirmed cases surged Wednesday to 5,500, a 25 per cent jump from the record set last week and triple the level from just two weeks ago.In Texas, which began lifting its shutdowns early on, on May 1, hospitalizations have doubled and new cases have tripled in two weeks.At Houston Methodist’s eight Texas hospitals, the Covid-19 patient count has tripled in the last month, to 312. About 20 per cent of the coronavirus tests the hospitals conduct now come back positive, compared with roughly 2 per cent to 4 per cent in mid-May.If the trends don’t change, the 2,000-bed hospital chain could have 600 coronavirus patients in the next three weeks and could be forced to cancel nonessential surgeries, Boom said.“We need everybody to behave perfectly and work together perfectly” to slow the infection rate, Boom said. “When I look at a restaurant or a business where people ... are not following the guidelines, where people are just throwing caution to the wind, it makes me angry.” In Arizona, cases will probably exceed statewide hospital bed capacity within the next several weeks if the trend continues, said Dr. Joseph Gerald, a University of Arizona public health policy professor.“We are in deep trouble,” said Gerald, urging the state to impose new restrictions on businesses, which Gov. Doug Ducey has refused to do. Without such steps, Gerald said, the death toll will reach “unheard-of” levels.Infectious-disease expert Dr. Peter Hotez said he worries that the states will squander what time they have to head off a much larger crisis.“We’re still talking about subtlety, still arguing whether or not we should wear masks, and still not understanding that a vaccine is not going to rescue us,” said Hotez, of the Baylor College of Medicine in Texas.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott initially barred local officials from fining or penalizing anyone for not wearing a mask as the state reopened. After cases began spiking, he said last week that cities and counties could allow businesses to require masks. Both Abbott and Ducey are Republicans.In Florida, several counties and cities have recently started requiring masks in public places and cracking down on businesses that don’t enforce social distancing rules.In a sign of the shift in the outbreak, New York, Connecticut and New Jersey announced they will require visitors from states with high coronavirus infection rates to quarantine themselves for 14 days. That is a turnaround from March, when Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued such an order for visitors from the New York City area, where cases were surging at the time.Cases are also surging in some other parts of the world. India reported a record daily increase of nearly 16,000 new cases, with an outbreak in the capital city of New Delhi becoming a rising concern. Mexico, where testing rates have been low, also set a record with more than 6,200 new cases.But China appears to have tamed a new outbreak in Beijing, once again demonstrating its ability to quickly mobilize its vast resources by testing nearly 2.5 million people in 11 days. China on Wednesday reported 12 cases nationwide, down from 22 the day before.In Europe, countries are both easing and increasing restrictions as the outbreaks evolve. Slovenia reintroduced mandatory use of face masks in public transportation and other enclosed public spaces after cases spiked in recent days, while Belgium said theaters and swimming pools could reopen next month. Infections there have nosedived over the past two months.In Africa, African Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief John Nkengasong said the outbreak is “picking up speed very quickly,” with a steep increase in cases and deaths as more countries loosen lockdowns. Africa has seen nearly 325,000 cases and over 8,600 deaths.Worldwide, more than 9.2 million people have been confirmed infected, and close to a half-million have died, by Johns Hopkins’ count.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coming-back-and-biting-us-us-sees-covid-19-make-a-comeback/story-cDkWavIBrWcrbAxBM1DqNJ.html

25-06-2020||World||‘Will act to check the spread of Beijing’s ideology’: US NSA||President Donald Trump’s national security adviser has warned China that the United States is waking up to the threat that it believes the Chinese Communist Party poses “to our great way of life” and will act to check the spread of Beijing’s ideology. Robert O’Brien said his speech challenging China was the first of many in the coming weeks by senior administration officials, including Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, Attorney General William Barr and FBI Director Christopher Wray. “The days of American passivity and naivety regarding the People’s Republic of China are over,” O’Brien told a group business leaders in Phoenix. “America, under President Trump’s leadership, has finally awoken to the threat of the Chinese Communist Party’s actions and the threat they pose to our great way of life.” This latest verbal offensive is an extension of Trump’s harsh words for Beijing’s handling of the coronavirus, which has killed more than 120,000 Americans. It follows on the heels of former national security John Bolton’s book that alleges Trump was soft on Chinese President Xi Jinping and other authoritarian leaders to advance his own political agenda.  According to Bolton, Trump asked Xi for China to buy more agricultural products to help the president win farm states and told the Chinese leader that he was right to build detention camps to house thousands of Chinese ethnic minorities. That statement could make the president’s tough-on-China mantra a hard sell. The Trump campaign released an online video last month that included clips of former Vice President Joe Biden previously describing the Chinese as “not bad folks” and saying economic growth in China was in the U.S. interest. O’Brien harsh words come as China has rebuffed US efforts to negotiate a three-way nuclear weapons treaty with Russia and as the administration seeks Beijing’s help in getting North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. The White House also is trying negotiate a new US-China trade agreement. The Trump adviser said the consensus for decades among American policymakers was as the US invested more in China and trained more Chinese engineers, scientists, bureaucrats and others, the faster China would liberalise — first economically and then politically. He said the US welcomed China into the World Trade Organization in 2001 with concessions and trade privileges while playing down China’s human rights abuses and the theft of US technology, which hurt American businesses. “As China grew richer and stronger, we believed that the Chinese Communist Party would liberalise to meet the rising democratic aspirations of its people,” O’Brien said. “This was a bold, quintessentially American idea. It was born of our innate optimism and by the experience of our triumph over Soviet communism. Unfortunately, it also turned out to be very naive.” O’Brien offered a list of Chinese activities that he said were aimed not only at repressing its own citizens, but influencing Americans. He said he was not attacking the Chinese people, but the Chinese Communist Party. He said China has worked to eliminate “unfriendly” Chinese language media outlets worldwide and has turned to Twitter to spread anti-American disinformation. In more than a dozen American cities, people listen to FM radio stations with “subtle pro-Beijing propaganda,” O’Brien said. Earlier this week, the administration designated the US operations of four major Chinese media outlets as “foreign missions” — an action that could force some of their staff to leave the country. He cited China’s cybersecurity activities that he said collect personal data on millions of Americans. He said the administration is working to prevent certain companies such as the tech giant Huawei that are closely tied to the Chinese Communist Party’s intelligence and security apparatus from accessing US data. Under Trump, the US has imposed restrictions on US semiconductor technology from going to Huawei and has limited the People’s Liberation Army’s ability to use student visa programs to place its officers in US colleges and universities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-act-to-check-the-spread-of-beijing-s-ideology-us-nsa/story-hr1kyoO677LF9xm9Dx4yEI.html
25-06-2020||World||Mexican president’s plan to meet with Trump draws criticism||Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador said Wednesday he plans to travel to Washington to meet with President Donald Trump, an announcement that was met with a storm of criticism in Mexico.López Obrador said he wants to make his first trip abroad in the first week of July to mark the start of the new US-Mexico-Canada free trade accord, which was negotiated with the Trump administration.Trump is deeply unpopular in Mexico because of his remarks about the country. And Mexicans remember former President Enrique Peña Nieto’s ill-starred meeting with Trump that many feel strengthened Trump as a candidate in the 2016 election. Mexico’s Foreign Relations Department then issued a statement saying López Obrador’s administration wants to steer clear of the US elections.The two leaders have displayed surprisingly cordial relations despite ideological differences. Trump said of López Obrador on Tuesday: “He’s really a great guy. I think he’ll be coming into Washington pretty soon.” López Obrador has called Trump a friend and said his administration has shown respect for MexicoRoberto Velasco Álvarez, the Foreign Relations Department’s director of North American affairs, wrote in his Twitter account that “Mexican diplomacy is based on building bridges with all people.”“The main objective of the meeting proposed by President López Obrador is promoting our interests, and is not related to internal (US) political processes,” Velasco Alvarez wrote.The critics were out in force, though.Mexico’s former ambassador to the US, Arturo Sarukhán, called the trip “a colossal political, electoral, diplomatic and long-term strategic error.”“Trump is only interested in using the Mexican president as a theatrical prop for the elections,” wrote Sarukhán. “For broad sectors of US society, visiting Trump now, when the country is experiencing its deepest social and ideological crisis in 50 years ... will be interpreted by many here as a show of support for the most polarizing president in modern US history.”Though he is famous in Mexico for declining international travel, López Obrador said early Wednesday that he wants to go to Washington. He said he hopes Canada will participate in the meeting as well, “but at any rate we will go because it is very important to participate at the launch of an agreement that I consider historic.”The president has studiously avoided conflict with Mexico’s much larger neighbor, even after Trump threatened to put crippling tariffs on Mexican goods imported into the US unless Mexico did more to stop migrant caravans. Mexico effectively blocked the caravans.Trump angered many Mexicans when as a candidate in 2016, he said Mexicans crossing the border brought drugs, crime and “tremendous infectious disease” to the US. At the time, critics said Peña Nieto gave him a pulpit when he invited both US candidates to Mexico City in 2016, but only Trump accepted. After taking office, Trump continued to promise to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it.In a recent piece for the Washington Post, Mexican columnist León Krauze wrote about the 2016 meeting, “Why would López Obrador, who was so critical of Peña Nieto’s decision to prop up Trump during a contentious election, risk international opprobrium and condemnation at home over the exact same mistake?”Krauze noted López Obrador hasn’t yet discussed meeting with Democratic Party candidate Joe Biden.“It could simply be another step in the Mexican president’s strange appeasement of the American president, a plan that has led him to embrace controversial immigration measures far from the humanitarian approach he promised as a candidate,” Krauze wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-president-s-plan-to-meet-with-trump-draws-criticism/story-hFw9fOglCMaGLEh7dKYjYJ.html
25-06-2020||World||Pak lands in FATF’s ‘Grey List’ after failing to check flow of money to Jaish, Lashkar||The global terror financing watchdog, FATF, on Wednesday decided to keep Pakistan in the “Grey List” as it has failed to check flow of money to terror groups like the LeT and the JeM, officials said.    The decision was taken at the Financial Action Task Force’s  third and final plenary held virtually due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The plenary was held under the Chinese Presidency of Xiangmin Liu. “The FATF plenary decided continuation of Pakistan in ‘Grey List’ till its next meeting to be held in October,” an official privy to the development said. The decision has been taken as Pakistan has failed to check flow of money to terror groups like Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-lands-in-fatf-s-grey-list-after-failing-to-check-flow-of-money-to-jaish-lashkar/story-FOY5QGNagqfqsP2ZYBLdFM.html
25-06-2020||World||‘Safe haven’: US report punches holes in Imran Khan’s track record against terrorists||Pakistan continues to serve as a safe haven for regionally focused terrorist groups and allows outfits including the Lashkar-e-Tayyiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed to operate from its territory, the US State department said in a new report released on Wednesday. The US indictment of Prime Minister Imran Khan’s track record in fighting terrorists comes against the backdrop of Islamabad’s brazen support for terrorists killed in encounters with security forces in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan’s foreign office counts them as “innocents”.Wednesday’s assessment by the US state department, which counted Pakistan as one of the countries that provide safe harbours for terrorists, is unlikely to go down well with Islamabad that faces a review by the anti-terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force in October. Islamabad was given a four-month reprieve after the FATF had to put off a scheduled review of Pakistan due to the coronavirus pandemic.German report spotlights Pakistan’s nuclear proliferation recordPakistan, along with Iran, North Korea and Syria are trying to obtain necessary products and know-how for nuclear weapons through illegal procurement efforts in Germany, according to the annual report of the Office for the Protection of the Constitution for the German State of Baden-Württemberg.The report said Pakistan had for many years been operating an extensive military nuclear weapons and carrier programme. “This is primarily directed against the “arch enemy” India, which also possesses nuclear weapons,” the report said. The German report noted Pakistan’s dependence on acquisition of western technology and procedures for maintenance and development and warned there could be efforts to illegally procure them in Germany.“In addition to acquisition of products (dual-use goods), the secondment of scientists to universities, institutes or research establishments is also important. This also applies to institutions in Baden-Württemberg,” the report said.In its Congressional-mandated annual report 2019 Country Reports on Terrorism, the State Department noted that Pakistan had taken modest steps to counter terror financing and restrain India-focused terror groups following the Pulwama suicide bombing in February 2019 that landed Imran Khan in a spot when the Jaish-e-Mohammed claimed responsibility for the bombing in Kashmir. But it hadn’t gone far enough.“Thus far, however, Islamabad has yet to take decisive actions against Indian- and Afghanistan-focused militants who would undermine their operational capability,” the report said.It also noted that Pakistan’s pledge under its 2015 action plan to dismantle all terrorist organizations without delay and discrimination was still unfulfilled. Pakistani authorities had indicted Lashkar founder Hafiz Saeed and 12 of his associates in December last year but had “made no effort to use domestic authorities to prosecute other terrorist leaders such as JeM founder Masood Azhar and Sajid Mir, the mastermind of LeT’s 2008 Mumbai attacks”.Both of them, the report said, “are widely believed to reside in Pakistan under the protection of the state, despite government denials”.“Several terrorist groups that focus on attacks outside the country continue to operate from Pakistani soil in 2019, including the Haqqani Network, Lashkar-e-Tayyiba, and Jaish-e-Mohammed,” the state department report said.The report indicted the Imran Khan government and military for their inaction, underlining that they “acted inconsistently with respect to terrorist safe havens throughout the country” and did not take sufficient action to stop certain terrorist groups and individuals from openly operating in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-still-a-safe-haven-for-terrorists-says-united-states-in-new-report/story-YBOIdRYtN5KiHZH5z2a3VP.html
25-06-2020||World||Rare books on Sikhism, Punjab emerge in London sale||A London-based rare books dealer on Wednesday launched a collection of rare books, original manuscripts and artwork on India that includes several first editions of work on Sikhs, Sikhism and Punjab dating from early eighteenth century.The 40-item collection from dealer Peter Harrington includes the first translation of the Adi Granth into English and several travel narratives set in the kingdom of Ranjit Singh, and military handbooks dedicated to Sikh customs – hailed in them as ‘the bravest and steadiest of soldiers’.Others offering glimpses of life in India under British rule include a book by Captain Lakshmi, who was appointed by Subhash Chandra Bose as commander of the Rani of Jhansi Regiment in the Indian national Army, and three elusive monographs on the ruling families of Punjab, written or inspired by Lepel H. Griffin, a colourful official in nineteenth century British India.Glen Mitchell, senior book specialist at Europe’s largest anquarian book dealer, said: “We have seen an increased interest in the last 20 years from collectors of works from the Indian sub-continent, and the demand for 19th and early 20th century British accounts of this fascinating period in colonial history continues to attract a core group of collectors based both in the region and diaspora in the UK and beyond.”“Topics that remain enduringly collectable include those focused on military exploits, colonial exploration, seminal religious texts, ethnographical, geographical, botanical and zoological accounts, and of course administrative, historical and political works,” he added.Highlights of the collection include an eyewitness account of Ranjit Singh’s kingdom written by Shahamat Ali, the expedition leader’s Indian-born munshi and inscribed by him to the earl of Shaftesbury; The Life of Robert Lord Clive, Baron Plassey by Charles Caraccioli – the first biography of Clive, considered something of a character assassination by his enemies within the East India Company; and I.N.A. Defence. Subject People’s Right to Fight for Freedom – two contemporary publications of the address delivered by J. Bhulabhai Desai in defence of members of the INA on trial for treason.Pom Harrington, owner of Peter Harrington, said: “While we have curated selections on Asia in the past, this is our first dedicated catalogue on works from India”. “The wealth of rich illustrations, lithographs, maps and coloured plates really lent themselves to creating an interactive and immersive digital-only catalogue that allows our clients to scroll through details and additional images of these fine works”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rare-books-on-sikhism-punjab-emerge-in-london-sale/story-It445bHhVoPN2bUC7Qi2dM.html
