The helpline reported a combined 136 complaints of cyber harassment in March and April during the lockdown compared to 47 such complaints, an increase of 189 per cent, before the lockdown in January and February.Seventy-four per cent of the complaints registered in March and April were reported by women, whereas men and non-binary persons registered 19 per cent and 5 per cent complaints, respectively, the not-for-profit organisation said in a press release. “As Pakistan entered its lockdown in response to the Covid-19 outbreak, we feared there would be an increase in cyber harassment cases as well as cyber-attacks in general,” it said.A majority of the cases that the organisation’s cyber harassment helpline received during the lockdown months “pertained to blackmailing through non-consensual sharing of information, intimate pictures and videos”.Complaints of hate speech, phishing, fake profiles and defamation were also reported.Women in Pakistan often face different kind gender-based violence in the digital sphere but the most common is sexual harassment and the Digital Rights Foundation suggested measures for the government to tackle this issue.It asked Federal Investigation Agency’s (FIA) accessibility for the people facing cyber threats and using technology to deal with digital harassment cases, like allowing for video testimonies.The Digital Rights Foundation works to ensure digital freedoms in the country to ensure unhindered access to internet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cyber-harassment-complaints-in-pakistan-up-by-189-during-lockdown-says-rights-body/story-fG4yAfWCzzUqtR8U7CugiK.html

New Jersey and Connecticut were also scheduled to hold their primaries on Tuesday but have postposed to a later date in July.Georgia and West Virginia are next, on June 7.In all, 4,750 delates — included 3,979 pledged delegates and 771 superdelegates (past and former presidents, other elected officials) — will pick the Democratic nominee at the party convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin starting August 17.Biden’s nomination is assured and despite early talk of a contested convention when Sanders had looked strong. The South Carolina primaries of February 29 changed the course of the race completely, setting Biden on the path to the nomination.Just the formal nomination now stands in the way of Biden, who is the presumptive Democratic nominee, in a direct fight President Donald Trump in the November 3 elections.The former vice-president has been beating Trump in polls, and by wide margin. He is ahead of the president by 8 points in the RealClearPolitics average of all polls (49.3-41.3),Trump has been been faring poorly in polls. After a brief uptick in favorability number in early days of the Covid-19 epidemic, its his unfavorable numbers that have since been climbing as deaths and infections surged and his administration stumbled from one shortage to another, marked by his own pronouncements, such as the suggestion to use of household disinfectants to combat the coronavirus.After been confined indoors at home in Delaware by the virus for weeks, Biden traveled to Philadelphia for a highly anticipated address the nation in which he delivered a stinging rebuke of the president’s handling of the civil unrest, and offered, his supporters argued, the kind of leadership and vision that is currently missing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-inches-closer-to-democratic-presidential-nomination/story-5lFe1DTB6zt3hQIjCJLLfM.html

Booms were laid in the Ambarnaya River to block the fuel; the river feeds a lake from which springs another river that leads to the environmentally delicate Arctic Ocean.Putin on Wednesday ordered officials to minimize the consequences of the spill. But Alexei Knizhnikov of the World Wildlife Fund’s Russia operation said the damage to fish and other resources could exceed 1 billion rubles ($13 million).The plant is operated by a division of Norilsk Nickel, whose factories in the area have made Norilsk one of the most heavily polluted places on Earth.No cause for the accident has been determined, but a company statement said it was concerned about facilities constructed on sinking soil above permafrost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emergency-declared-in-siberia-after-20-000-tons-of-diesel-fuel-leaks-from-power-plant/story-BlNoh8vxLXD4HEPwqBT66K.html
03-06-2020||World||WHO says anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine’s coronavirus trials to resume||The World Health Organization announced Wednesday that clinical trials of the drug hydroxychloroquine will resume as it searches for potential coronavirus treatments.On May 25, the WHO announced it had temporarily suspended the trials to conduct a safety review, which has now concluded there is “no reason” to change the way the trials are conducted.The UN health agency’s decision came after a study published in The Lancet medical journal suggesting the drug could increase the risk of death among COVID-19 patients.The executive group of the so-called Solidarity Trial -- in which hundreds of hospitals across the world have enrolled patients to test several possible treatments for the novel coronavirus -- took the decision as a precaution.Hydroxychloroquine is normally used to treat arthritis but public figures including US President Donald Trump have backed the drug for COVID-19 prevention and treatment, prompting governments to bulk-buy.“Last week, the executive group of the Solidarity Trial decided to implement a temporary pause of the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial, because of concerns raised about the safety of the drug,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual news briefing.“This decision was taken as a precaution while the safety data were reviewed.“The data safety and monitoring committee of the Solidarity Trial has been reviewing the data.“On the basis of the available mortality data, the members of the committee recommended that there are no reasons to modify the trial protocol.“The executive group received this recommendation and endorsed continuation of all arms of the Solidarity Trial, including hydroxychloroquine.“The executive group will communicate with the principal investigators in the trial about resuming the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial.“The data safety and monitoring committee will continue to closely monitor the safety of all therapeutics being tested in the Solidarity Trial.”More than 3,500 patients have been recruited across 35 countries to take part in the trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-anti-malaria-drug-hydroxychloroquine-s-coronavirus-trials-to-resume/story-Frh9Hik3vPMXPXNEugUpFI.html
03-06-2020||World||Study that led WHO to drop anti-malaria drug against Covid-19 faces big questions||British medical journal the Lancet on Tuesday said it had concerns about data behind an influential article that found hydroxychloroquine increased the risk of death in Covid-19 patients, a conclusion that undercut scientific interest in the medicine championed by US President Donald Trump.Hydroxychloroquine - which has anti-inflammatory and antiviral properties - inhibited the coronavirus in laboratory experiments but has not been proven effective in humans, particularly in placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trials considered the gold standard for data. The debate has become highly politicized, and many scientists have voiced concern.Nearly 150 doctors signed an open letter to the Lancet last week calling the article’s conclusions into question and asking to make public the peer review comments that preceded publication.“This is not some sideshow or minor issue,” said Dr. Walid Gellad, a professor at University of Pittsburgh’s medical school, who was not a signatory of the letter but has been critical of the study.“We’re in an unprecedented pandemic. We’ve organized these enormous clinical trials to figure out if something works. And this study stopped or paused a couple of those trials, and changed the narrative around a drug that no one knows if it works or not,” he said.The observational study published in the Lancet on May 22 looked at 96,000 hospitalized Covid-19 patients, some treated with the decades-old malaria drug that Trump said he took and has urged others to use.Several clinical trials were put on hold after the study was published.The study, using data provided by healthcare data analytics firm Surgisphere, was not a traditional clinical trial that would have compared hydroxychloroquine to a placebo or other medicine.The Lancet’s editors said in a note that serious scientific questions about the study were brought to their attention and an independent audit of the data has already been commissioned.Surgisphere said in a statement that the audit “will bring further transparency to our work (and) further highlight the quality of our work.”Earlier on Tuesday, the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) said it was concerned about the quality of the data behind a different study it published in May that also used data from Surgisphere and had the same lead author. Dr. Mandeep Mehra, the lead author and a professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School, defended the use of the Surgisphere dataset as an intermediary step until clinical data is available.“I eagerly await word from the independent audits, the results of which will inform any further action,” Mehra said in a statement after the Lancet note. The World Health Organization (WHO) suspended hydroxychloroquine’s use in a large trial on Covid-19 patients after the Lancet study. Following the WHO trial suspension, the governments of France, Italy and Belgium halted the use of hydroxychloroquine for Covid-19 patients.Among the critics of the study to sign the letter last week were several academics from the University of Oxford and Mahidol Oxford Tropical Medicine Research Unit (MORU) in Bangkok, which had been conducting the global “COPCOV” trial of hydroxychloroquine as a treatment of Covid-19.The trial was paused last week, after the Lancet article.In March, Trump, with little scientific evidence, said hydroxychloroquine used in combination with the antibiotic azithromycin had “a real chance to be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.” He later said he took the drugs preventively after two people who worked at the White House were diagnosed with Covid-19.Trump and Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro discussed a joint research effort on using hydroxychloroquine as both a prophylaxis and treatment for the coronavirus, the White House said on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-study-that-linked-hcq-to-deaths-in-covid-19-patients-comes-under-a-cloud/story-17VRlHE2g5VtBtQBkVfzpM.html
03-06-2020||World||16 dead including 5 children in new eastern DR Congo massacre||Sixteen civilians, five of them children, were killed overnight in a fresh massacre in the eastern DR Congo province of Ituri, a local official and a UN source said on Wednesday.“The toll, which is still provisional, is of 16 people killed by knives or gunfire. The people killed are four men, seven women and five children all aged under five,” the administrator of Djugu territory, Adel Alingi, told AFP.The toll was separately confirmed by a source in the United Nations’ peacekeeping force, MONUSCO.The attack unfolded at a village in the area of Mambisa, north of the Ituri capital Bunia, the sources said.The authorities attributed it to a notorious ethnic militia called CODECO, for the Cooperative for the Development of the Congo.The organisation is mainly drawn from the Lendu ethnic group, who are predominantly farmers and clash repeatedly with the Hema community of traders and herders.Nearly 300 civilians have been killed since the start of the year in attacks blamed on CODECO, while the UN says around 200,000 people have fled their homes.UN human rights chief Michelle Bachelet, in a visit to Ituri in late January, said “crimes against humanity” had been perpetrated.Tens of thousands of people were killed in Hema-Lendu fighting between 1999 and 2003.A surge in violence in 2003 triggered the European Union’s first military mission outside Europe -- Operation Artemis, under which a rapid-response force was deployed for three months to dampen the fighting. Ituri is one of several provinces gripped by militia violence in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, a country the size of continental western Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/16-dead-including-5-children-in-new-eastern-dr-congo-massacre/story-Jxd2ZkaP62a1JHiM8Na9qJ.html
03-06-2020||World||George Floyd death: US protesters flout curfew but violence subsides||US protesters ignored curfews overnight as they vented their anger over the death of an unarmed black man at the hands of police, but there was a marked drop in the violence that prompted President Donald Trump to threaten to deploy the military.George Floyd died after a white policeman pinned his neck under a knee for nearly nine minutes in Minneapolis on May 25, reigniting the explosive issue of police brutality against African Americans five months before the November presidential election. Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of cities coast to coast for an eighth night as National Guard troops lined the steps of the Lincoln Memorial in Washington.There was sporadic violence in Washington and Portland, Oregon, with protesters tossing fireworks and bottles answered by police flash grenades and tear gas.Also read: Floyd protests: Indian-American hailed as hero after he opens his home for over 70 protestorsClashes between protesters and police and looting of some stores in New York gave way to relative quiet in the early hours of Wednesday. Police told media they made 200 arrests, largely for curfew violations.In Los Angeles, many demonstrators who defied the curfew were arrested but by mid-evening, calm had been restored to the extent that television stations switched from wall-to-wall coverage back to regular programming.Large marches and rallies also took place in Philadelphia, Atlanta, Denver and Seattle.The officer who knelt on Floyd, Derek Chauvin, 44, has been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Three other officers involved were fired but have not been charged.‘SILENCE IS VIOLENCE’Although rallies on behalf of Floyd and other victims of police brutality in recent days have been largely peaceful, after dark many have turned to vandalism, arson and looting. On Monday night, five police officers were hit by gunfire in two cities. Outside the US Capitol building on Tuesday afternoon a throng took to one knee, chanting “silence is violence” and “no justice, no peace,” as officers faced them just before the government-imposed curfew.Many of the protesters used the slogan “take a knee”, referring both to how Floyd died and a long-standing protest against racism in America that started in 2016 with a football player taking a knee instead of standing during the National Anthem.The crowd remained after dark, despite the curfew and vows by Trump to crack down on what he has called lawlessness by “hoodlums” and “thugs,” using National Guard troops or even the US military if necessary.In Atlanta, four officers and two former officers were charged with using excessive force while arresting two students. Minneapolis launched an investigation into possible discriminatory practices in the police department over the last 10 years.In New York, thousands of chanting protesters ignored the curfew to march from the Barclays Center in Flatbush toward the Brooklyn Bridge as police helicopters whirred overheard.The crowd halted at an entrance to the Manhattan Bridge roadway, chanted at riot police: “Walk with us! Walk with us.”New York state police arrested a 30-year-old woman Tuesday after she drove a car striking three police at a demonstration in Buffalo on Monday.On Hollywood Boulevard in Los Angeles, hundreds of people filled the street, marching past famous landmarks of the film center. Others gathered outside Los Angeles Police Department headquarters downtown, in some cases hugging and shaking hands with a line of officers outside.Los Angeles was the scene of violent riots in 1992, following the acquittal of four policemen charged in the beating of black motorist Rodney King, that saw more than 60 people killed and an estimated $1 billion in damage.In Rome, Pope Francis called for national reconciliation in the United States, saying that while racism is intolerable, the street violence that has broken out is “self-destructive and self-defeating”.A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday found a majority of Americans sympathize with the protesters. The survey conducted on Monday and Tuesday found 64% of American adults were “sympathetic to people who are out protesting right now,” while 27% said they were not and 9% were unsure.In Minneapolis, Roxie Washington, mother of Floyd’s six-year-old daughter, Gianna, told a news conference he was a good man.“I want everybody to know that this is what those officers took from me....,” she said, sobbing. “Gianna does not have a father. He will never see her grow up, graduate.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-us-protesters-flout-curfew-but-violence-subsides/story-RxnLFUQvqv3NJAjJtuE7KJ.html
03-06-2020||World||‘Nobody is safe unless everybody is safe’: Global vaccine group on Covid-19 pandemic||The head of the global vaccine alliance has warned “nobody is safe unless everybody is safe” from the new coronavirus, urging international solidarity ahead of a fundraising summit as the pandemic threatens to trigger a resurgence of preventable diseases. Scientists are racing to identify and test possible vaccines for Covid-19 as nations grapple with the economic and societal consequences of the virus lockdowns.Follow coronavirus latest updates here Seth Berkley of Gavi, the vaccine alliance, said the international community must ensure all countries will have access to any potential vaccines, regardless of their wealth. “This is a global problem that needs a global solution and we have to all work together,” he said.He spoke ahead of a virtual summit hosted by Britain on Thursday, where Gavi hopes to raise at least $7.4 billion to continue vaccination programmes against diseases like measles, polio and typhoid that have been severely disrupted by the pandemic.Also read: Covid-19 cases in India to cross 15K-a-day mark by mid-June, predicts ChinaThe meeting will also see Gavi and its partners launch a financing drive to purchase potential Covid-19 vaccines, scale up their production, and support delivery to developing nations. The fundraising goal for Covid-19 is $2 billion, although Berkley said it was an initial sum as they kickstart negotiations with manufacturers and could go up “substantially”. Click here for complete coronavirus coverage The meeting comes as the pandemic exposes new ruptures in international cooperation. US President Donald Trump last week announced he would pull out of the World Health Organization and there are fears America may use its economic clout to buy up vaccines. Berkley said that countries needed a “different mindset”, adding that sharing access to drugs was not just a humanitarian and equality issue, but a global health security one. “Nobody is safe unless everybody is safe. We saw the virus move from somewhere around Wuhan to 180 countries in less than three months, including islands and isolated areas,” he said.‘Perfect storm’The World Health Organization, UN children’s agency UNICEF and Gavi warned last month that the pandemic had hindered routine immunisation services in nearly 70 countries, affecting around 80 million children under the age of one.Polio eradication drives were suspended in dozens of countries, including those still struggling with the debilitating illness, while measles vaccination campaigns were also put on hold in 27 countries, UNICEF said. Recent Gavi-supported modelling from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical medicine estimated that for every Covid-19 death prevented by halting vaccination campaigns in Africa, up to 140 people could die from vaccine-preventable diseases. Berkley said the situation was improving, with new guidance on how to carry out immunisation campaigns safely.But he said locating all the children who missed out on vaccines before new outbreaks emerge will be a “real challenge”.Thursday’s funding drive is for a five-year period in which the organisation aims to reboot halted programmes in the countries it supports -- allowing them to access vaccines at a much reduced cost -- with the goal of reaching some 300 million children. Berkley said he was “cautiously optimistic” that the target would be reached, with more new countries pledging donations despite the economic strains of the pandemic. Recalling past episodes when vaccine work was stalled by the outbreak of diseases such as Ebola and SARS, another coronavirus, he urged nations to move beyond “boom and bust” cycles of crisis planning. “I don’t think this coronavirus is going to go away like SARS did,” he said. He also warned of an “unprecedented” level of rumour and conspiracy theory around vaccinations, particularly from the northern hemisphere. “Distrust between people in their government, the rumours and the intentional spread of false information is not only at an all time high, but it also is being amplified by social media tools that didn’t exist 20 years ago,” he said.“So we have almost a perfect storm of problems.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobody-is-safe-unless-everybody-is-safe-global-vaccine-group-on-covid-19-pandemic/story-HWmyMt8S5DzgXY4JPnPpFJ.html

There was no immediate word on any casualties.The activists said the strikes on and near Idlib province were the first to be conducted by Russian planes since a truce brought relative calm to the volatile region in early March.The truce, brokered by Turkey and Russia, halted a terrifying three-month air and ground campaign that had killed hundreds and sent 1 million people fleeing toward the Turkish border.Russia is a main backer of Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces while Turkey supports the opposition. In recent years, Moscow and Ankara have become the main power-brokers in Syria, shattered by a civil war since 2011.Opposition activists said that in recent days, both Turkey and the government in Damascus have been sending reinforcements to northwestern Syria. There have also been repeated violations of the truce on the ground in recent weeks.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, an opposition war monitoring group, said Russian warplanes targeted rebel-held areas just south of Idlib province late Tuesday and Wednesday morning. It had no immediate word on casualties in the four airstrikes.Idlib-based activist Taher al-Omar said Russian warplanes fired missiles that caused wide destruction. He also gave no word on casualties.Another Idlib-based activist, Hadi Abdullah, said Wednesday’s strikes hit a mountain region in Latakia province on the edge of Idlib, and a power station on the northern edge of Hama province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-activists-report-russian-airstrikes-on-idlib-province/story-TM21XB7dZGVHI0czpoQTlM.html

Foreign Minister Heiko Maas will talk with EU counterparts in the next two weeks about “how travel within Europe can be gradually re-established,” he said in Berlin Tuesday.Germany’s shift away from an across-the-board travel warning, put in place in March as the pandemic was sweeping across Europe, will hinge on coordination with EU member states and on whether the spread of the disease is kept in check.Maas, who said he didn’t yet have vacation plans of his own, has indicated that opening up travel in Europe will be gradual and that holidays this year would not be the same as in the past. Germany has gradually moved to lift border restrictions with neighboring countries such as France and Austria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-moves-to-reactivate-european-travel-as-coronavirus-ebbs/story-P8ZXgOc6mzNv0A9nlbviBK.html

China could enact the law later this month or at the end of August, analysts have said.About 350,000 Hong Kong citizens hold British National Overseas passports, a legacy of the colonial era, and 2.5 million others are eligible to apply for them, Johnson said in his column. Long lines have formed at DHL courier offices in the city since the announcement as people rush to apply for or renew their BNO passports.Johnson, echoing earlier statements by Cabinet ministers, said that if China imposes a national security law, Britain would allow holders of the BNO passports to remain for 12 months on a renewable basis and would grant them the right to work, placing them on a possible path to UK citizenship.“This would amount to one of the biggest changes in our visa system in British history,” Johnson wrote, adding, “I hope it will not come to this.”BNO passport holders currently can stay in the UK for only up to six months.Separately on Wednesday, Hong Kong pro-democracy activist Joshua Wong called on leaders in Europe to oppose the national security law, saying it erodes the “one country, two systems” framework promised to the semi-autonomous Chinese territory.Wong said that after President Donald Trump threatened to impose sanctions on Hong Kong last week, the momentum should be kept to build a “global alliance to stand with Hong Kong.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-pledges-to-let-in-hong-kong-citizens-if-needed/story-NJg6honyHl44PriN6EHpvO.html

Gatherings of more than 50 people continue to be banned, but throughout the crisis Swedes have been able to visit restaurants, go shopping, attend gyms and send children under 16 to school.The laxer approach to containing the virus has drawn both praise and indignation from across the globe. What is beyond debate, however, is the effect the strategy has had on the country’s death toll.At 43 deaths per 100,000, Sweden’s death rate is among the highest globally and far exceeds that of neighboring Denmark and Norway, which imposed much tougher lockdowns at the outset of the pandemic.Now, Tegnell has for the first time admitted publicly that the strategy is resulting in too many deaths.“Clearly, there is potential for improvement in what we have done in Sweden,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-behind-sweden-s-controversial-covid-19-strategy-admits-mistakes/story-DOVF7OKXg7sHbXmeM2JHwK.html

Groups of people also looted pharmacies, electronic stores and other businesses across the city.“The NYPD (New York Police Department) and the Mayor did not do their job last night. I believe that…. What happened in New York City was inexcusable,” New York State Governor Cuomo said at his daily briefing Tuesday, referring to widespread looting and violence across the city on Monday night.“Use the police, protect property, and people. Look in the videos. It was a disgrace,” he said, referring to several videos posted on social media that showed looters break into stores in Manhattan, including Macy’s flagship retail and stealing merchandise.Cuomo said that while protestors are outraged over the killing of Floyd, there is “criminal activity, looting, extremist groups, who are using this moment for their own purposes and exploiting this movement and moment. Two very different things.” “New York City was looted. It was looted yesterday. In Manhattan, middle of Manhattan, also in communities of colour, in the Bronx and in Brooklyn, where we’ve spent years doing economic development in distressed communities and these looters destroyed businesses that were essential to the community and the very people we’re trying to help,” the governor said.He said the looters are breaking store windows, going in and stealing and are demeaning Floyd’s murder by using the protests as an opportunity for criminal activity. “They have no right to wrap themselves in the flag of righteous indignation of Floyd’s murder. And that’s what they’re doing. They’re opportunists who are seizing and exploiting the moment.” Cuomo said with a 38,000 strong force, the NYPD is the largest police department in the US and those personnel should be brought in to protect the city’s property. “The police must stop the looting and the criminal activity. That is the essence of the police force. They are supported to protect the community, protect the property. They did not do that in New York City last night,” he said.Expressing disappointment and outrage at the incidents in the New York City on Monday night, Cuomo said the looters and their vandalism hurt everyone. “And the police in New York City were not effective at doing their job last night, period. They have to do a better job. But, separate the protestors from the looting.” Mayor de Blasio had on Monday extended the citywide curfew from 8 pm to 500 am for the whole week.US President Donald Trump, a Republican, tweeted that the curfew in the New York City should begin at 7pm daily and that the National Guard should be brought in to control the protests and looting. “NYC, CALL UP THE NATIONAL GUARD. The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he tweeted.On the looting inside the Macy’s store, over 2.5 million square feet of retail space and one of the largest retail stores in the world, Trump said the largest single department store in the world and a “point of pride in NYC, was devastated yesterday when hoodlums and thieves vandalized it, breaking almost all of its large panels of storefront glass. What a shame. Bring in National Guard!” Cuomo said 13,000 National Guard are on standby and he has offered de Blasio and all other mayors of the cities in the state to deploy the special forces. The mayor has said that New York City does not need the National Guard and the police force will be sufficient to manage the situation.“The mayor said he can handle it with the NYPD. My option is to displace the mayor of New York City and bring in the National Guard as the governor in a state of emergency and basically take over the mayor’s job,” Cuomo said, adding that such an option does not make any sense since the city is already in a chaotic situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the protests. On Trump’s call for deploying the National Guard in the New York City, Cuomo, a Democrat, said Trump “doesn’t want to distinguish between the looters and the protestors. See the president doesn’t want to speak about the killing of Floyd, the President wants to talk about just looting because if he’s talking about looting, he doesn’t have to talk about the killing of Floyd, and he doesn’t want to talk about… reforming the justice system, he doesn’t want to talk about that so he wants to say they’re all looters. They’re not all looters. That’s his political spin on all of this.” Mayor de Blasio also stressed that “we do not need nor do we think it’s wise for the National Guard to be in New York City nor any armed forces… A National Guard – a member of the guard called up from any part of this state doesn’t have that particular training, doesn’t know our environment, but is carrying a loaded weapon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/violence-looting-in-new-york-city-inexcusable-disgrace-cuomo/story-NpUZgy1I7ckD9VLLZ9IHJO.html
03-06-2020||World||San Diego police ban controversial neck restraint which killed George Floyd||More than a week after the death of George Floyd, the San Diego police said that it will end the controversial practice of carotid restraint.San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer and police chief David Nisleit said at a press conference on Monday that the practice will be “immediately stopped”.Nisleit also said that this is the right thing to do for the community.Also read: He will never see her grow up, graduate, says mother of George Floyd’s daughterUnder the carotid restraint, an immobilisation technique, a police officer applies pressure to sides of a detainee’s neck to render him unconscious. “But no police academy that we know of teaches a police officer to use their knee, to put it on their neck,” Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, which researches and advises on police practices, to,d news agency Associated Press.“That’s just not taught because that can impact their breathing and their carotid artery (a crucial vessel that supplies blood to the brain),” he added.Officers are also taught to get a suspect up from the ground as soon as possible, either sitting or standing, since lying on one’s stomach can cause breathing problems, especially for larger people.Also Read: Donald Trump threatens to send in army as protests against Floyd’s death simmerFloyd, 46, was arrested on Monday (May 25) in Minneapolis after an employee at a grocery store called police to accuse him of trying to pass a counterfeit $20 bill. The cellphone video shows Floyd, who is black, face-down on the ground with his hands cuffed behind his back, as officer Derek Chauvin, who is white, uses the knee restraint on his neck.Floyd’s head is turned to the side and he does not appear to be resisting. As the minutes tick by and Chauvin continues to hold him down, Floyd’s complaints about not being able to breathe stop as he falls silent and motionless. Toward the end of the video, paramedics arrive, lift a limp Floyd onto a stretcher and place him in an ambulance.“He wasn’t actively resisting, and he was saying he couldn’t breathe,” said Charles P. Stephenson, a former police officer and FBI agent with expertise in use-of-force tactics. “You have to understand that possibility is there (that Floyd couldn’t breathe), and you release any kind of restriction you might have on an airway immediately.”Chauvin and the three other responding officers have been fired, and the FBI is investigating whether they willfully deprived Floyd of his civil rights.Other cities like New York and Chicago have already banned the practice of restraining a person throug this controversial hold. However, Minneapolis where Floyd was killed, allows it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/san-diego-police-ban-controversial-neck-restraint-which-killed-george-floyd/story-CjHUPO6Oim2qFNYqEngRaI.html
03-06-2020||World||‘He will never see her grow up, graduate’: Mother of George Floyd’s daughter||The grieving mother of George Floyd’s daughter on Tuesday demanded justice for him, saying he was a good father who did not deserve to die face down on the pavement, pinned under the weight of a police officer.“At the end of the day, they get to go home and be with their families,” Washington said. “Gianna doesn’t have a father. He will never see her grow up, graduate. He will never walk her down the aisle,” she said with six-year-old Gianna clinging to her.Washington said she wants all four officers involved in Floyd’s death to pay for the killing.“He loved her, he loved her so much,” Washington said in her first comments since the incident on May 25. “I’m here for my baby. I’m here for George because I want justice for him, and I want justice for him because he was good. No matter what anybody thinks, he was good.”Floyd, 46, was handcuffed and pinned to the ground in Minneapolis on Monday last week by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath.Protests and violence began across the US soon after the incident and have been continuing since then.Tens of thousands of people took to the streets of major US cities on Tuesday for an eighth consecutive night of protests over Floyd’s death, defying pleas by mayors, strict curfews and other measures meant to curtail them.Major marches took place in Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Atlanta and New York City as well as in Washington, DC, near the park where demonstrators were cleared on Monday to make a path for President Donald Trump so he could walk from the White House to a historic church for a photo. Although rallies on behalf of Floyd and other victims of police brutality have been largely peaceful during the day, after dark each night crowds have turned to rioting, vandalism, arson and looting. On Monday night, five police officers were hit by gunfire in two cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-will-never-see-her-grow-up-graduate-mother-of-george-floyd-s-daughter/story-ij7GvXNgs50WUH88BmdnYI.html
03-06-2020||World||‘Not stopping’: Defiant New York City protesters march through curfew||An 8 p.m. curfew didn’t stop thousands of defiant demonstrators from marching through the streets of New York City throughout the night Tuesday, though some of the rampant destruction seen over the past few nights was quelled.The citywide curfew, which is in place through Sunday and was moved earlier from the previous night, was instated to prevent the widespread damage and destruction that has filled the city’s streets over the last two nights after largely peaceful dayside protests.Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on a citywide curfew, but rejected urging from President Donald Trump and an offer from Gov. Andrew Cuomo to bring in the National Guard.“Everyone, time to go home so we can keep people safe,” he said on WINS-AM radio shortly after the curfew took effect.But demonstrators continued winding through the streets, mostly in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as part of ongoing nationwide protests following the May 25 death of George Floyd and other recent racially charged killings.“I’m surprised,” said Risha Munoz, on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, where at points they were greeted with cheers and horns by onlookers in building windows. “I didn’t think they were gonna let us go on, but we just kept on moving and we’re not stopping.”“Something has to break, and it’s not going to be us,” said Evan Kutcher, one of hundreds of demonstrators who stood outside the Barclays Center chanting Floyd’s name Tuesday evening.Police began making arrests around 9 p.m. and shut down parts of the West Side Highway in lower Manhattan, blocking it off to huge crowds of protesters. The police department announced it would not allow vehicle traffic south of 96th Street in Manhattan after curfew, though residents, essential workers, buses and truck deliveries were exempt.“We’re going to have a tough few days. We’re going to beat it back,” de Blasio, a Democrat, said.Jane Rossi said she witnessed officers rip a man out of his car and arrest him in Chelsea around 10:45 p.m.The car was behind a group of several hundred protesters that had roamed Manhattan peacefully since leaving Trump Tower at 8 p.m. Tensions had risen moments earlier when some in the group began trying to damage a bike rental station and banged on the windows of a JCPenny’s. The vast majority of the crowd moved to stop the them.Officers surrounded the car and arrested the driver moments later.“They were just driving behind the protesters making sure that we were safe,” Rossi said. “They were part of the protest.”Just after midnight Wednesday, most of the city’s streets were cleared aside from police patrolling, especially in hot-spot areas for demonstrations in areas of Brooklyn and Manhattan. There was a heavy police presence in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Crown Heights, where authorities say police fatally shot a man after responding to reports of shots fired. NYPD Chief of Department Terence Monahan said the officer-involved shooting was not connected to the protests.Protests continued in New York City and across the country Tuesday following the death of Floyd, a black man who died last week after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee on Floyd’s neck even after he stopped moving and pleading for air.While de Blasio insisted the city would put a stop to the violence and vandalism that have marred largely peaceful mass demonstrations surrounding Floyd’s death, both the Republican president and the Democratic governor laid into the city’s handling of the mayhem thus far.“The NYPD and the mayor did not do their job last night,” Cuomo said at a briefing in Albany. “Look at the videos. It was a disgrace.”He said the mayor was underestimating the problem and the nation’s largest police force wasn’t deployed in sufficient numbers, though the city had said it doubled the usual police presence.Cuomo’s remarks infuriated Monahan, the New York Police Department’s highest-ranking uniformed member.. Officers are “giving their blood to keep this city safe,” he told the New York Post, adding that he’d been hit by a bike and bloodied himself while arresting suspects Monday night. Cuomo spokesman Richard Azzopardi later said the governor “has respect and confidence in the NYPD” and felt the mayor should put more officers on the streets.Unprompted, Cuomo brought up the possibility of using his power as governor to replace the mayor and deploy the National Guard over de Blasio’s objections, then immediately shot down the idea as legally impractical and unnecessary.On Twitter, Trump urged a 7 p.m. curfew and National Guard deployment in his native city.“The lowlifes and losers are ripping you apart. Act fast!” he wrote.But de Blasio said the NYPD was “best equipped” to handle the lawbreaking, arguing that bringing in the National Guard risked fueling worse conflict in a city on edge.“We will regret it if we bring outside armed forces,” he said. “When you bring in people not trained for the circumstance but still with loaded weapons and put under horrible stress, really bad things happen.”The mayhem over the last four nights has challenged the 36,000-officer police force, which has a reputation as a muscular, well-resourced agency that has driven down crime and faced down terror threats in the nation’s biggest city.On Monday night and early Tuesday, police again struggled to keep up with, let alone get ahead of, roving groups of people bashing their way into shops, including Macy’s flagship Manhattan store.Nearly 700 people were arrested overnight, and several officers were injured. A sergeant was struck by a hit-and-run driver in the Bronx and was hospitalized in serious but stable condition, police said. Video also showed a group of people hitting a police officer with pieces of wreckage until he pulled his gun and they ran.De Blasio said officials expected problems farther downtown, as had happened the night before, and “adjustments were made” once officials realized that the hot spots had shifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/not-stopping-defiant-new-york-city-protesters-march-through-curfew/story-XYREVPRuI0MwjFhMxLxKKI.html

The 46-year-old man was handcuffed and pinned to the ground in Minneapolis on May 25 by a white police officer who kneeled on his neck as he gasped for breath.“As the night approaches I urge all citizens to obey the curfews, clear the streets & stay inside to spend time with loved ones,” Melania Trump said on Tuesday.“All cities, communities and citizens deserve to be kept safe and that can only be done if we work together towards healing and peace,” the First Lady said in a tweet.A day earlier she had said that she was saddened to see “our country and communities being damaged and vandalized.” In a tweet, Melania Trump asked everyone to protest peacefully and focus on taking care of one another and healing the great nation.In one of her tweets, she asked Americans not to turn violent during their protests.“Our country allows for peaceful protests, but there is no reason for violence. I’ve seen our citizens unify and take care of one another through Covid-19 and we can’t stop now,” she said.“My deepest condolences to the family of George Floyd. As a nation, let’s focus on peace, prayers and healing,” Melania Trump said.On Tuesday she joined President Donald Trump in visiting the Saint John Paul II National Shrine. The First Couple laid a ceremonial wreath and observe a moment of remembrance under the Statue of Saint John Paul II. The President and First Lady also visited the Luminous Mysteries Chapel, John Paul II Blood Relic, and the Madonna Icon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-lady-melania-trump-asks-people-to-stay-inside-their-homes/story-raFBaHn1u5VjRi2JJBUduM.html
03-06-2020||World||EU looks to Boris Johnson to stop No-Deal Brexit with talks at impasse||The European Union will try to convince Boris Johnson to forge a compromise later this month in an attempt to stop the UK from breaking away from the bloc without a trade deal.With the negotiations deadlocked, and the latest talks set to end Friday without a breakthrough, the EU is pinning its hopes on a dramatic intervention by the British Prime Minister when he speaks to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and EU Council President Charles Michel later this month, according to people familiar with the matter in Brussels.Johnson will be told where the EU could potentially make concessions -- as long as the UK takes a similarly conciliatory approach, the people said. That could allow the two sides to reach an accord in the second half, they said.But there is no guarantee that the Prime Minister will agree. On Tuesday, Johnson’s spokesman, James Slack, dismissed suggestions of a compromise as “wishful thinking by the EU.” The UK government has threatened to walk away from the negotiations in June if they haven’t made adequate progress.If the two sides fail to reach an agreement by year-end, Britain will default to trading with the bloc on terms set by the World Trade Organization, leaving businesses and consumers grappling with the return of tariffs and quotas.Compromise EffortsThe EU is demanding that, in return for any deal, the UK agrees to apply some of the bloc’s rules after Brexit to maintain a level competitive playing field. It also wants the European Court of Justice to continue to have jurisdiction in the UK and for European fishing vessels to maintain their access to British waters.So far, though, British officials have ruled out accepting those demands. Johnson has made it clear that he believes Britain’s vote to leave the bloc means that the country should be fully independent, one UK official said.Behind the rhetoric, though, diplomats say the two sides have started to map out where a deal could be done as they work out which positions are genuine red lines and which leave room for maneuver.European diplomats say the bloc could water down its demands on fishing and, to a more limited extent, on the level playing field.In return, they expect the UK to make a similar leap -- but so far, one hasn’t been forthcoming. While the UK has offered to stick to current EU standards to prevent unfair competition by way of a so-called non-regression clause, the EU doesn’t believe that promise goes far enough.Much of this week’s discussions will be focused on fisheries. The EU’s public position is to demand the status quo, where European fishing boats have access to British waters under a quota system based on historic catch areas. The UK wants to replace that with annual negotiations that reflect more accurately where fish are found today.‘Manifestly Unbalanced’At the end of the last round of talks, the UK’s chief negotiator, David Frost, called the European approach “manifestly unbalanced.” His EU counterpart, Michel Barnier, acknowledged that both sides had taken “maximalist” starting positions that they could move away from.Even if the two sides inch closer toward agreement on fishing, though, they will still have to reconcile their divisions on the role of the EU courts. One UK official warned that Britain will never agree to align with EU laws or accept the continued jurisdiction of the European courts -- and accused the EU of ignoring the political realities of Brexit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-looks-to-boris-johnson-to-stop-no-deal-brexit-with-talks-at-impasse/story-rUgDz9tpnr1UA1MJMcdnEM.html
03-06-2020||World||Perils for Pentagon as Trump threatens to militarize response to civil unrest||“Battlespace” was the word Defense Secretary Mark Esper used to describe protest sites in the United States. The top US general reinforced that image by appearing in downtown Washington in camouflage during a Monday evening crackdown. Helicopters that could easily be mistaken for active duty US military ones staged show-of-force maneuvers in Washington above people protesting the killing of George Floyd, an unarmed black man, at the hands of a white police officer in Minneapolis.As President Donald Trump increasingly turns to militaristic rhetoric at a time of national upheaval, the US military appears to be playing a supporting role - alarming current and former officials who see danger to the US armed forces, one of America’s most revered and well funded institutions.“America is not a battleground. Our fellow citizens are not the enemy,” Martin Dempsey, the retired four-star general who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, wrote on Twitter.A current military official, speaking on condition of anonymity, voiced concern about the lasting damage that would come from using the military as a “political prop.”“Presidents come and go ... the uniform has to be maintained,” the official said.For Trump’s critics, the Republican president’s reliance on the military in domestic endeavors risks making the armed forces, which are meant to be apolitical, appear aligned with Trump’s political agenda. He has previously employed the military to help stem illegal immigration and used defense funding to build his border wall.But drawing the military into his response to the sometimes violent civil unrest that broke out in Minneapolis last week and spread to dozens of cities, is particularly problematic.At the core of the discomfort is a single idea: The military was designed to protect the United States from foreign adversaries and uphold a constitution that explicitly protects the rights of citizens to protest peacefully.Even the head of the National Guard acknowledged that responding to domestic crises makes his troops uneasy. So far, more than 20,000 National Guard members have been called up to assist local law enforcement with protests around the country.“This mission is an uncomfortable mission. They don’t like doing it, but we can do it,” said General Joseph Lengyel, chief of the National Guard Bureau.UNWITTING SUPPORT?Esper and General Mark Milley, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, accompanied Trump on Monday as he posed at a church near the White House while holding a Bible after law enforcement officers used teargas and rubber bullets to clear the area of peaceful protesters.Trump had just delivered a speech condemning “acts of domestic terror” and saying the United States was in the grips of professional anarchists, violent mobs, arsonists, looters, criminals and others.A senior defense official suggested neither Esper nor Milley knew about the photo-op and had been at the White House to give Trump an update on response efforts.“As that meeting concluded, the president indicated an interest in viewing the troops that were outside and the secretary and the chairman went with him to do so. That’s the extent of what was taking place,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.In a memo to Defense Department employees on Tuesday, Esper called on personnel to “stay apolitical in these turbulent days.”James Miller, a former Pentagon official who sits on the Defense Science Board, said he was resigning from the board after seeing the peaceful protesters being cleared by tear gas and rubber bullets before a curfew on Monday and Esper’s accompanying Trump to the church.“You may not have been able to stop President Trump from directing this appalling use of force, but you could have chosen to oppose it,” Miller said in his letter of resignation, which he published in the Washington Post.Kori Schake, of the conservative American Enterprise Institute and an expert on US civilian-military relations, said Esper and Milley need to be held to account for their “shocking” decision to appear in that setting.“They made choices. They could have said, Mr. President, I think it would send a bad signal for me to do this,” Schake said. Alice Friend, a former Pentagon official, said Esper and Milley, by using terms like battlespace, were blurring the lines between American citizens in the United States and enemies in war zones.“To divide and conquer at home, using the United States military, is an incredible escalation of the government’s coercive power,” said Friend, a fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.A senior defense official, asked about such criticism, said Esper was simply using the terminology he’s accustomed to using as the leader of America’s military.But the Pentagon’s role in the civil unrest could soon dramatically deepen if Trump decides to deploy active duty forces, something the US military has been reluctant so far to do.Trump on Monday threatened to send active duty US troops to stamp out the civil unrest gripping several cities.To deploy the military on US soil for law enforcement purposes, Trump would need to invoke the 1807 Insurrection Act something last done in 1992 in response to the Rodney King riots in Los Angeles.To that end, the US military has pre-positioned active duty forces, largely military police and engineers, on the outskirts of the Washington, D.C.-area to potentially deploy, if needed.The top Republican on the House of Representatives Armed Services Committee, Mac Thornberry, said discussions about the Insurrection Act could easily make US troops “political pawns.”His Democratic counterpart and chair of the committee, Adam Smith, said he called on Esper and Milley to testify.“I remain gravely concerned about President Trump’s seemingly autocratic rule and how it affects the judgment of our military leadership,” Smith said. “The fate of our democracy depends on how we navigate this time of crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/perils-for-pentagon-as-trump-threatens-to-militarize-response-to-civil-unrest/story-lZS80RwKnsyzn4FxvhWXkL.html

Three days later, Twitter slapped a rule-violation notice on another post by Trump warning protesters in Minnesota that “when the looting starts, the shooting starts.”“We are NOT attempting to address all misinformation,” the company’s @twittersafety account wrote on Tuesday. “Instead, we prioritize based on the highest potential for harm, focusing on manipulated media, civic integrity, and Covid-19. Likelihood, severity and type of potential harm — along with reach and scale — factor into this.”Still, the company has resisted other calls to drop Trump from its service entirely. “It’s important people can read and speak about what world leaders say, even if they violate our rules,” Twitter wrote on Tuesday.The San Francisco-based company said it “shouldn’t determine the truthfulness of tweets,” but tries to “provide context to help people make up their own minds in cases where the substance of a Tweet is disputed.”“Hence, our focus is on providing context, not fact-checking,” it added.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/twitter-signals-trump-tweets-will-stay-even-if-they-break-rules/story-VnxiyfVoxzd9zd2NglsfVK.html
03-06-2020||World||Facebook takes down white nationalist and fake antifa accounts||Facebook Inc said on Tuesday it has suspended accounts associated with white nationalist groups after some advocated bringing weapons to the current wave of anti-racist protests.Company officials also said they removed accounts falsely claiming allegiance to antifa in order to bring discredit to the anti-fascist movement.Antifa adherents have said they focus on defending people from attacks by authorities or vigilantes, but they have been vilified by President Donald Trump who, without citing evidence, said they were instigators of anti-police violence.Some of the removed white nationalist accounts were associated with the Proud Boys, which Facebook previously classified as a dangerous group. The others had connections to a group called the American Guard, which is now classified the same way.Multiple Facebook executives described the action on condition they not be identified. They said they acted based on behavior, not the politics of any content, and that Facebook had not designated antifa as dangerous.The company said it was looking closer at accounts discussing protests when it saw what it deemed white nationalist accounts encouraging violence.The misleading antifa accounts were removed for “inauthentic behavior,” because they purported to be something they were not, Facebook said.As with a false antifa tweet that Twitter Inc tied to a third white nationalist group and which was widely distributed as a screen shot, the Facebook executives said Tuesday the goal of such content is often not to win thousands of followers but to plant a single false flag that can be used to sow distrust about the target group.Facebook declined to comment on whether it had been in touch with law enforcement, which it typically does in cases of an imminent threat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-takes-down-white-nationalist-and-fake-antifa-accounts/story-X2iZjhrySnlbaoqxKQ7kjN.html
03-06-2020||World||Not so ‘Incognito’: Google faces lawsuit for tracking ‘private’ surfing||Google was sued on Tuesday in a proposed class action accusing the internet search company of illegally invading the privacy of millions of users by pervasively tracking their internet use through browsers set in “private” mode.The lawsuit seeks at least $5 billion (4 billion pounds), accusing the Alphabet Inc unit of surreptitiously collecting information about what people view online and where they browse, despite their using what Google calls Incognito mode.According to the complaint filed in the federal court in San Jose, California, Google gathers data through Google Analytics, Google Ad Manager and other applications and website plug-ins, including smartphone apps, regardless of whether users click on Google-supported ads.This helps Google learn about users’ friends, hobbies, favorite foods, shopping habits, and even the “most intimate and potentially embarrassing things” they search for online, the complaint said.Google “cannot continue to engage in the covert and unauthorized data collection from virtually every American with a computer or phone,” the complaint said.Jose Castaneda, a Google spokesman, said the Mountain View, California-based company will defend itself vigorously against the claims.“As we clearly state each time you open a new incognito tab, websites might be able to collect information about your browsing activity,” he said.While users may view private browsing as a safe haven from watchful eyes, computer security researchers have long raised concern that Google and rivals might augment user profiles by tracking people’s identities across different browsing modes, combining data from private and ordinary internet surfing.The complaint said the proposed class likely includes “millions” of Google users who since June 1, 2016 browsed the internet in “private” mode.It seeks at least $5,000 of damages per user for violations of federal wiretapping and California privacy laws.Boies Schiller & Flexner represents the plaintiffs Chasom Brown, Maria Nguyen and William Byatt.

03-06-2020||World||Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg still under fire over inflammatory Trump posts||Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg isn’t budging over his refusal to take action on inflammatory posts by President Donald Trump that spread misinformation about voting by mail and, many said, encouraged violence against protesters.His critics, however, are multiplying. Some employees have publicly quit over the issue and civil-rights leaders who met with him Monday night denounced Zuckerberg’s explanation for choosing to leave Trump’s posts alone as “incomprehensible.”A day after dozens of Facebook employees staged a virtual walkout over the issue, the Facebook chief met Tuesday with employees for a Q&A session held via online video. During that session, which had been moved forward from later in the week, Zuckerberg reportedly doubled down on his stance to leave Trump’s posts alone — although he did suggest that the company was considering changes to its existing policies around “state use of force,” which Trump’s Minneapolis post fell under.Facebook rival Twitter flagged and demoted a Trump tweet in which he referenced protests over police violence in Minneapolis using the phrase “when the looting starts the shooting starts.” But Facebook let an identical message stand on its service. Zuckerberg explained his reasoning in a Facebook post Friday, a position he has since reiterated several times.In photos: Rage and anguish from George Floyd protests spreading across US cities“I know many people are upset that we’ve left the President’s posts up, but our position is that we should enable as much expression as possible unless it will cause imminent risk of specific harms or dangers spelled out in clear policies,” Zuckerberg wrote.The resignations, which multiple engineers tweeted and posted on LinkedIn and Facebook, also began Tuesday.“I am proud to announce that as of the end of today, I am no longer a Facebook employee,” tweeted Owen Anderson, who was an engineering manager at the company for two years. “To be clear, this was in the works for a while. But after last week, I am happy to no longer support policies and values I vehemently disagree with.”Anderson did not immediately respond to a message for comment on Tuesday. But he wasn’t alone.“Today, I submitted my resignation to Facebook,” Timothy J. Aveni, a software engineer who’d been at the company for a year, wrote on LinkedIn and on his Facebook page. “I cannot stand by Facebook’s continued refusal to act on the president’s bigoted messages aimed at radicalizing the American public. I’m scared for my country, and I’m watching my company do nothing to challenge the increasingly dangerous status quo.”Aveni did not immediately respond to a message for further comment.“We recognize the pain many of our people are feeling right now, especially our Black community. We encourage employees to speak openly when they disagree with leadership,” Facebook said in a statement. “As we face additional difficult decisions around content ahead, we’ll continue seeking their honest feedback.”Barry Schnitt, who served as Facebook’s director of communications and public policy from 2008 until 2012, wrote a blistering Medium post Monday. “Facebook says, and may even believe, that it is on the side of free speech,” he wrote. “In fact, it has put itself on the side of profit and cowardice.”“I do not think it is a coincidence that Facebook’s choices appease those in power who have made misinformation, blatant racism and inciting violence part of their platform,” he added, urging Facebook leaders to take responsibility and “show the world that you are not putting profit over values.”Zuckerberg and other Facebook leaders also met with civil rights leaders on Monday night. That conversation apparently didn’t go well.“We are disappointed and stunned by Mark’s incomprehensible explanations for allowing the Trump posts to remain up,” three civil-rights leaders wrote in a joint statement. “He did not demonstrate understanding of historic or modern-day voter suppression and he refuses to acknowledge how Facebook is facilitating Trump’s call for violence against protesters.”Signing that statement were Vanita Gupta, president and CEO of The Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights; Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change.“Mark is setting a very dangerous precedent for other voices who would say similar harmful things on Facebook,” the three leaders added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-s-mark-zuckerberg-still-under-fire-over-inflammatory-trump-posts/story-9J08uSbOqb1e9LXXkaoUII.html
03-06-2020||World||Canadian PM pauses when asked about US protests, avoids naming Trump||Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has refused to directly address the announcements and actions of US President Donald Trump with regard to violence following the killing of African-American George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. Trudeau paused for as long as 21 seconds when asked for his reaction, and avoided naming Trump in his response and instead focused upon race relations in Canada.Following the lengthy silence during his daily media briefing on the Covid-19 pandemic, Trudeau said that everyone was watching with “horror and consternation at what is going on in the United States.” He went on to add that this was a time to “pull people together” and to “listen and learn”, when injustices continue despite progress over years and decades.”Trudeau was asked again about Trump, but he would not name the American President in his response. He also said there was the need to look at Canadian institutions and “ensure that those barriers that may be invisible to many of us but are far too present for black Canadians and racialized Canadians, are addressed.”This matter came up again as Trudeau addressed the House of Commons, the lower chamber of Canada’s Parliament. “I’m not here today to describe a reality I do not know or speak to a pain I have not felt. I want you to know that our government is listening,” he said.Late last year, as the October Federal elections were imminent, several photographs and videos of Trudeau emerged showing him in brown and black face. He apologised for those acts during his younger days, and again riffed on those failures, as he said, “I’m not perfect.” He added that was not a free pass not to do the “right thing.”Trudeau said, “I’m not here today to describe a reality I do not know or speak to a pain I have not felt. I want you to know that our government is listening.” However, he acknowledged the presence of systematic discrimination against minorities in Canada and need to address that challenge that not everyone saw.Canada has also witnessed protests in cities like Toronto and Montreal after the eruption in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-trudeau-focuses-on-race-relations-in-canada-avoids-naming-trump-in-response-to-us-protests/story-E22bhetWVBm6igkRHUAdXJ.html

George Bush and Laura Bush said they believe that peaceful marches are good for the country.“It remains a shocking failure that many African-Americans, especially young African-American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country,” the statement read.“Laura and I are anguished by the brutal suffocation of George Floyd and disturbed by the injustice and fear that suffocate our country. Yet we have resisted the urge to speak out, because this is not the time for us to lecture. It is time for us to listen,” George Bush said. “It is time for America to examine our tragic failures – and as we do, we will also see some of our redeeming strengths. It remains a shocking failure that many African Americans, especially young African American men, are harassed and threatened in their own country. It is a strength when protesters, protected by responsible law enforcement, march for a better future,” he said. This tragedy, in a long series of similar tragedies, raises a long overdue question of “how do we end systemic racism in our society?” George Bush asked.“The only way to see ourselves in a true light is to listen to the voices of so many who are hurting and grieving. Those who set out to silence those voices do not understand the meaning of America — or how it becomes a better place,” he said.America’s greatest challenge has long been to unite people of very different backgrounds into a single nation of justice and opportunity. The doctrine and habits of racial superiority, which once nearly split the country, still threatens our Union, he said. The answers to American problems are found by living up to American ideals, to the fundamental truth that all human beings are created equal and endowed by God with certain rights, the former president said.  “We have often underestimated how radical that quest really is, and how our cherished principles challenge systems of intended or assumed injustice. The heroes of America — from Frederick Douglass, to Harriet Tubman, to Abraham Lincoln, to Martin Luther King, Jr. — are heroes of unity,” he said. “Their calling has never been for the fainthearted. They often revealed the nation’s disturbing bigotry and exploitation — stains on our character sometimes difficult for the American majority to examine. We can only see the reality of America’s need by seeing it through the eyes of the threatened, oppressed, and disenfranchised,” George Bush said.“That is exactly where we now stand. Many doubt the justice of our country, and with good reason. Black people see the repeated violation of their rights without an urgent and adequate response from American institutions. We know that lasting justice will only come by peaceful means. Looting is not liberation, and destruction is not progress,” he said . Lasting peace in communities requires truly equal justice. The rule of law ultimately depends on the fairness and legitimacy of the legal system, and achieving justice for all is the duty of all, George Bush said.“This will require a consistent, courageous, and creative effort. We serve our neighbours best when we try to understand their experience. We love our neighbours as ourselves when we treat them as equals, in both protection and compassion,” the statement read. There is a better way. The way of empathy and shared commitment, and bold action, and a peace rooted in justice, George Bush said. “I am confident that together, Americans will choose the better way,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/have-to-push-for-justice-examine-nation-s-tragic-failures-george-w-bush-on-floyd-protests/story-oK3FuOnZESGP5L5wyO2yrJ.html

But Trudeau, who is usually quick to answer, paused and struggled to come up with the right words when asked about Trump calling for military action against protesters and the use of tear gas for a photo opportunity.The prime minister avoided mentioning Trump directly. Also Watch | Trump threatens to use military force to crush protests sparked by Floyd’s death“We all watch in horror and consternation at what is going on the United States,” he said. “It is time to pull people together.” Police violently broke up a peaceful and legal protest by several thousand people in Lafayette Park across from the White House ahead of a speech in the Rose Garden by Trump on Monday. The protesters had gathered following the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis a week earlier.Afterward, Trump strolled out of the White House gates and walked across the cleared Lafayette Park to make a surprise visit to St John’s Church. Trump, standing alone in front of cameras, raised a Bible. He didn’t mention Floyd, the church or the peaceful protesters police had just cleared away.In the same question Trudeau was also asked what message he is sending if he he didn’t comment about Trump’s actions.“Clearly, Trudeau was not expecting this pointed question. I think he was considering whether to respond at all, which could have been taken to mean he was not going to criticize Trump,” said Nelson Wiseman, a political science professor at the University of Toronto.“His comments are a criticism of Trump without naming Trump,” he said.Wiseman said Trudeau was wise not to mention Trump directly.“Trudeau is smart enough to know that. Trump has shown that he can blow a fuse even if he isn’t mentioned directly, as happened at the end of the G7,” Wiseman said.Trump vowed to make Canada pay after Trudeau said he wouldn’t be bullied in trade talks at the conclusion of the G7 meeting in Quebec in 2018. Trump called Trudeau “weak” and “dishonest.” He threatened tariffs on cars and slapped them on steel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-questions-render-trudeau-speechless-for-21-seconds/story-pf0DS8cjo2aFv2HiEkz6OO.html
03-06-2020||World||Donors rally to Biden in wake of Trump’s response to protests||Democratic donors are pouring money into Joe Biden’s campaign in the wake of the protests spurred by the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last week.Two fundraisers said President Donald Trump’s response to the protests and violence that has accompanied some of them have motivated donors to give even more to support Biden.“As a ‘bundler,’ you’re usually out chasing the bundle but now the bundle is chasing me,” said John Morgan, a longtime Florida-based Democratic fundraiser and one of Biden’s biggest backers. Bundlers raise contributions for candidates and parties from their professional and personal networks and “bundle” them together.Employees of Morgan’s law firm, Morgan & Morgan, gave Biden more than $435,000, his third largest source of funds for the primary. Those donations were capped at $2,800, but now Morgan, who’s preparing to raise bigger sums in the general election, can collect bigger checks through different channels.Biden has set up a fundraising vehicle that can accept much bigger amounts, split between the Democratic National Committee, his campaign and 26 state parties, the general election fundraising will far outpace the primaries. He says he’s fielded multiple calls this week from donors who can write large checks – the maximum donation is now $620,300 – asking how they can support the campaign.“It’s a whole new ballgame,” Morgan said. And it could help Biden narrow the financial advantage Trump, who faced no serious primary opposition, has built for November. Biden’s fundraising has trailed Trump, whose re-election effort raised $742 million in the last 16 months. Biden and the Democratic National Committee took in less than half of that, $342 million, through the end of April. Trump, the Republican National Committee and two fundraising vehicles had $255 million in the bank at the end of that month compared to $103 million for Biden and the DNC.Unlike Biden, Trump spent heavily on media, including pricey television ads, in May, in response to falling poll numbers. His campaign booked $17.8 million worth of ads, including $4.1 million on digital platforms, that month, according to Advertising Analytics, compared to $3 million for Biden, which was all spent on online ads. Campaigns and parties report their May fundraising numbers to the Federal Election Commission on June 20.Democratic fundraisers say their donors have been energized by Trump’s performance since the killing of Floyd, who died after a white police officer pressed a knee into his neck for more than eight minutes. Violence erupted in dozens of cities, from Minneapolis to New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington.Trump’s confrontational tone – he urged governors to “dominate the streets” in a call on Monday and vowed to deploy the military to quell violence – are one factor in the surge, but even more significant is his failure to offer a unifying message to a country already reeling from the coronavirus epidemic and now facing racially charged violence, said Mitchell Berger, a longtime Democratic fundraiser from Florida.“Donors are saying he’s not doing it, he’s not capable of doing it, so our only option is to dig deeper and make sure he doesn’t win a second term,” Berger said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donors-rally-to-biden-in-wake-of-trump-s-response-to-protests/story-zalqgm4nQV33HZ053YXk8K.html
03-06-2020||World||Man gets 10-month sentence for threatening Muslim politician||A North Carolina man was sentenced Tuesday to 10 months in prison for anonymously threatening on social media to lynch a Muslim-American man who ran for a state Senate seat in Virginia, according to prosecutors.Joseph Cecil Vandevere, 53, of Black Mountain, had faced a maximum sentence of 5 years in prison after a federal jury in Asheville, North Carolina, convicted him in December of interstate communication of a threat to injure a person.US District Judge Max Cogburn Jr. also sentenced Vandevere to a year of supervised release after his prison term, said Lia Bantavani, a spokeswoman for US Attorney’s office for the Western District of North Carolina. Vandevere will report to prison at a date to be determined, according to Bantavani, who said sentencing guidelines called for a prison term of 10 to 16 months.Vandevere was charged last June in connection with a tweet directed at candidate Qasim Rashid. The March 2018 tweet included a picture of a lynching and read, “VIEW YOUR DESTINY.” Rashid posted a screenshot of the threatening tweet and reported it to the FBI.The judge also ordered Vandevere to pay $224 in restitution to Rashid.Rashid didn’t express support for a prison sentence but said he had urged the court to fine Vandevere $250,000, the statutory maximum, to “send the strongest message that there are material consequences for this kind of violent behaviour.” “Our goal from the get-go was to emphasize rehabilitation and reform,” he told The Associated Press after the hearing. “We’re a bit concerned that this (sentence) may not send that kind of deterrent message.” In a statement submitted to the court after the trial, Rashid said Vandevere’s threat evoked painful memories of a cousin who was lynched and dragged through the streets of Pakistan two decades ago, “his neck broken and his life taken because of his faith.”  “Seeing Mr. Vandevere’s threat, I felt found, thousands of miles away, by that same generational pain of violent religious persecution that my family had fled,” Rashid wrote.Authorities also accused Vandevere of posting an anti-Semitic threat on a Florida synagogue’s Facebook page.Investigators linked Vandevere to a threatening comment posted in February 2018 on the website of a synagogue in Plantation, Florida, according to an FBI agent’s affidavit. A rabbi at Ramat Shalom Synagogue contacted the FBI after somebody using the name Bob Smith posted a “disturbing” comment in response to the rabbi’s post showing support for the Parkland, Florida, high school where a gunman killed 17 people earlier that month, the agent wrote.Investigators linked Vandevere’s telephone number to the same Twitter account — with the handle “DaDUTCHMAN5″ — that posted the threat against Rashid, according to the affidavit. The post was accompanied by a black-and-white photograph of the infamous 1915 lynching of a Jewish man, Leo Frank, in Marietta, Georgia.Twitter suspended the “DaDUTCHMAN5” account.Rashid, a Democrat, lost his November 2019 bid to defeat an incumbent Republican state senator in Virginia. Prosecutors have said Rashid’s political campaign started well after the threat was made “and had no bearing on the threat.” Rashid, an attorney who works on immigrant rights cases, testified at Vandevere’s two-day trial. Rashid said in his post-trial statement to the court that Vandevere’s threat still haunts him and his family, with his wife constantly fearing for his safety.“I am forced to act now, in many ways, like someone who is hunted,” he wrote in January.In September, Cogburn rejected Vandevere’s argument that his indictment must be dismissed on First Amendment free speech grounds.Vandevere’s attorney, Andrew Banzhoff, claimed the communication in question was not a “true threat.” “In 2019, the political arena necessarily includes the public exchange of political views that occurs daily on Twitter and other social media sites,” Banzhoff wrote.But the judge said he couldn’t rule as a matter of law that the alleged threat was “political hyperbole” or that “no reasonable person would interpret this communication as a serious expression of intent to do harm.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-gets-10-month-sentence-for-threatening-muslim-politician/story-pB7sDZ60o5Rp7IFeQMVp9J.html

Also Watch | ‘From my personal experience…’: UK PM Boris Johnson returns to work after covid boutHe described China’s step as being in conflict with the obligations under the Joint Declaration.“If China imposes its national security law, the British government will change our immigration rules,” Johnson said.Under the change, holders of British National Overseas passports from Hong Kong would be allowed to enter the UK for a renewable period of 12 months and given further immigration rights, he added, “including the right to work, which could place them on a route to citizenship”.About 350,000 of the territory’s people currently hold such passports and another 2.5 million would be eligible to apply for them, Johnson said.China’s parliament last week approved a decision to create laws for Hong Kong to curb sedition, secession, terrorism and foreign interference. Mainland security and intelligence agents may be stationed in the city for the first time.On Tuesday, Britain warned Beijing to step back from the brink over the national security law in Hong Kong, saying it risked destroying one of the jewels of Asia’s economy while ruining the reputation of China.Last week, U.S. President Donald Trump ordered his administration to begin the process of eliminating special U.S. treatment for Hong Kong to punish China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-change-immigration-rules-if-china-imposes-security-law-on-hong-kong-boris-johnson/story-neGCZizugF2K8NosMrYaZN.html

Prime Minister Modi said that India would be happy to work with the US and other countries to ensure the success of the proposed Summit, the PMO said.Expressing concern regarding the ongoing civil disturbances in the US, Modi conveyed his best wishes for an early resolution of the situation.“The two leaders also exchanged views on other topical issues, such as the COVID-19 situation in the two countries, the situation on the India-China border, and the need for reforms in the World Health Organisation,” the PMO said. During the call, Trump warmly recalled his visit to India in February this year. “Modi said that the visit had been memorable and historic on many accounts, and had also added new dynamism to the bilateral relationship,” the statement said. “The exceptional warmth and candour of the conversation reflected the special nature of the Indo-US ties, as well as the friendship and mutual esteem between both leaders,” the PMO statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-ship-first-tranche-of-100-ventilators-to-india-next-week-white-house/story-x7UNG2ecAUL9Lz2Bw5wcpI.html
03-06-2020||World||George Floyd death: Donald Trump threatens to send in army||At least six police officers were shot at during violent protests over the death of George Floyd, an African-American man in police custody, hours after US President Donald Trump threatened he would deploy the military if the ongoing unrest does not stop. Protests and clashes took place in more than 40 US cities as four American policemen were shot at in St Louis and one each in Los Angeles and Las Vegas. In another escalatory incident, an SUV hit two officers at a protest in Buffalo, New York, which slapped a curfew as looters hit luxury stores. Thousands marched in Sydney on Tuesday in solidarity with US protests as demonstrators from Australia to Europe identified with the cause of the protests and urged their own governments to address racism and police violence. Hong Kong’s leader Carrie Lam criticised the “double standards” of foreign governments over national security matters.Trump said on Monday that he had asked state officials to deploy military reservists of the National Guard in “sufficient numbers to dominate the streets”. If a state official refuses, he said, “I will deploy the US military and quickly solve the problem for them”.“I want the organisers of this terror to be own notice that you will face severe criminal penalties and lengthy sentences in jail,” the US president threatened, adding that he had ordered “swift and decisive action” to bring the situation under control in Washington, DC as National Guard troops moved on protesters outside the White House. Trump’s threat to deploy soldiers sparked a debate about whether he had legal authority to do so. Under the Insurrection Act, a law that is over 200 years old, the US president can deploy the military on American soil to deal with civil disorder, insurrection or rebellion.Flash-bang bombs, tear gas shells and rubber bullets were used to disperse a peaceful demonstration from a side of the White House facing Lafayette Square Park. More than 5,000 people were arrested from around the country.On Tuesday night, the BBC reported that the White House had “asked about taking over Washington, DC police”. Trump administration officials had reportedly considered the idea of taking over the capital city’s police force, according to an official in the city mayor’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-threatens-to-send-in-army/story-d56uYfm8IzBkBmiUGN1HTO.html
03-06-2020||World||NYC placed under curfew as looters raid luxury store||New York was under a curfew that would last until Tuesday, officials said, after looters raided stores in central Manhattan, targeting some of the city’s top retailers.Upmarket fashion store Michael Kors on Fifth Avenue was among the luxury outlets hit, along with Nike, Lego and electronics shops across Midtown, before the 11pm to 5am curfew came into effect, AFP journalists said.Groups of young people moved from block to block around the district, usually bustling with tourists but deserted due to the coronavirus pandemic, with entire streets blocked by police.Images from local NY1 television showed some young people running out of a Best Buy electronics store before being apprehended by the police. Stores in the south of Manhattan suffered a similar fate, according to an AFP photographer.The New York Times reported that the flagship Macy’s department store had also been targeted by looters.Police did not immediately confirm this, simply saying that “numerous stores were hit” and arrests made “in the hundreds” across the city.Mayor Bill de Blasio said a lot of stores around Madison Avenue had been hit and the situation was “really not acceptable.” As a result, he said the curfew would start from 8pm on Tuesday instead of 11pm. “The city is fully under control, and overwhelmingly calm and peaceful,” he nevertheless insisted on NY1.The imposition of the curfew had been announced a few hours earlier by the mayor and New York state governor Andrew Cuomo after protests and looting during the weekend - notably in the trendy SoHo district.The mayor tweeted on Monday that “protesters were overwhelmingly peaceful today” but that some people were out to damage property and steal. “We support peaceful protest in this city. But right now it’s time to go home,” de Blasio said. “Some people are out tonight not to protest but to destroy property and hurt others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nyc-placed-under-curfew-as-looters-raid/story-ppH6aYSuFsGNNYTR6ekBqJ.html

The pandemic has now killed more than 377,000 people and infected at least 6.3 million since erupting in China in late 2019. Four of the 10 countries across the globe with the greatest number of new Covid-19 cases on Monday were in Latin America, WHO emergencies director Michael Ryan said. Brazil, Peru and Chile are suffering the highest daily increases but numbers are also on the rise in Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia and Haiti.The region has logged one million cases and recorded more than 50,000 deaths, with Brazil having more than half of cases and close to 60% of fatalities.The mayor of Rio de Janeiro said on Monday however that the popular tourist city would start gradually easing lockdown measures from Tuesday, beginning with the reopening of places of worship and water sports. Ryan warned that the region faces a tough battle in the weeks ahead. “I don’t believe we have reached the peak in that transmission and, at this point, I cannot predict when we will,” he said.In Europe, however, from Russia to France, Italy and Britain, countries have started to emerge from lockdowns, cautiously adopting a post-pandemic version of normal. Bars began to serve again in Finland and Norway - with social distancing restrictions or shortened hours in place - while some schools in Britain and Greece opened their doors. Greece opened some hotels, schools, pools and tattoo parlours, while Italy reopened the Colosseum, although only to Italians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-torments-south-america-while-europe-limps/story-9XffZDU6mJ9cz1q8WHiuxN.html

And I won’t either. But I promise you this. I won’t traffic in fear and division. I won’t fan the flames of hate.”This was Biden’s first speech outside his home state of Delaware to a live audience since Covid-19 sent his and all other election campaigns indoors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-blasts-donald-trump-s-church-photo-op-handling-of-protests/story-sewtiOWeLZv8JBNExd8rML.html
