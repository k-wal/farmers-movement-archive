And it says nearly all the Fed’s policymakers foresee no rate hike through 2022.The Fed has cut its benchmark short-term rate to near zero. Keeping its rate ultra-low for more than two more years could make it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend enough to sustain an economy depressed by business shutdowns and high unemployment.The central bank noted in a statement after its policy meeting ended Wednesday that the viral outbreak has caused a sharp fall in economic activity and surge in job losses.Fed officials estimate that the economy will shrink 6.5% this year, in line with other forecasts, before expanding 5% in 2021. It foresees sees the unemployment rate at 9.3%, near the peak of the last recession, by the end of this year. The rate is now 13.3%.At a virtual news conference Wednesday afternoon, Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to drive home the message that the economy remains in need of extraordinary help despite recent despite glimmers of a possible recovery, including a government report Friday that employers surprisingly added jobs in May.Since March, the Fed has slashed its benchmark short-term rate, bought $2.1 trillion in Treasury and mortgage bonds to inject cash into markets and rolled out nine lending programs to try to keep credit flowing smoothly. Most analysts expect the Fed to pause and assess the economic landscape before embarking on any further actions, which could come at September’s meeting.The Fed’s actions are credited with having helped fuel an extraordinary rally in the stock market, which has nearly regained its pre-pandemic high after a dizzying plunge in March.And by committing to buy corporate bonds, thereby reinvigorating the market for such securities, the Fed has also ensured that corporations can continue to borrow. Its initiatives also include a first-ever program through which the Fed is buying state and local government debt to support the municipal bond market.Many economists say those steps have prevented the downturn from worsening, by keeping credit flowing. This week, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of recessions, declared that the U.S. economy entered a recession in February.One challenge for the Fed now is to shift its focus from the emergency actions it took in March and April to try to carry the economy through a shutdown, to what steps it will take to stimulate a recovery as businesses increasingly reopen.In remarks last month, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida stressed that the viral outbreak remains a menace to the economy. But he also indicated that Fed officials want to see a few more months of data to gauge the economy’s health before determining their next steps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-economy-to-shrink-6-5-in-2020-no-rate-hike-through-2022-fed-officials/story-JkUld05PII391j9nMICM8I.html

10-06-2020||World||Anthony Fauci warns Covid-19 ‘isn’t over yet’||Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist, said Tuesday in a warning that will be heard around the world that the Covid-19 pandemic, “isn’t over yet”.“Now we have something that turns out indeed to be my worst nightmare,” Fauci said at a virtual conference held by Biotechnology Innovation Organization. “In a period of four months, it has devastated the world; 110,000 deaths in the US. There’s millions and millions of infections worldwide. And it isn’t over yet.”The United States, which has been rolling back social distancing measures steadily, is close to crossing the 2 million mark for Covid-19 infections, with 1.97 million Wednesday morning. Fatalities are more than 122,000, with 683 in the past 24 hours.Fauci has been cautioning against hasty withdrawal of the social distancing norms that are understood to have prevented many more deaths in the United States. Though he is a member of a task force set up by President Donald Trump to lead the fight against the epidemic here, Fauci has been odds with the president, who is in a hurry to reopen the economy and get it going full throttle again with an eye on his election prospects.The public health measures in place are only going to work so much to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. But the world needs is a vaccine, or more to get ahead of it. The virus will no “”urn itself out with mere public health measures”, he said, adding, “We’re going to need a vaccine for the entire world, billions and billions of doses”.There are three leading vaccine candidates, among the more than 100 in the works, that have the world’s eyes on them. Moderna is expected start final trials on its vaccine in July; Oxford University and AstraZeneca are looking at a September date for their end trials (with a partner Indian pharmaceutical company contracted to churn out the volumes needed) and Johnson & Johnson has moved up is first stage trials to July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-warns-covid-19-isn-t-over-yet/story-4MsaXjxJK9zYpYfWLdN9RO.html
10-06-2020||World||Army tightens grip on Pakistan as Imran Khan’s popularity wanes||There’s now more than a dozen former and current military officials in prominent government roles, such as running the state-owned air carrier, the power regulator and the National Institute of Health, which is leading the country’s pandemic response. Three of those appointments happened in the last two months.The military’s heightened profile comes as Prime Minister Imran Khan sees his influence and popularity dwindle due to a slowing economy, high consumer prices and corruption investigations involving his close aides. Analysts have long seen army support as critical for Khan’s party, which holds 46% of seats in parliament, to hold together a government that relies on several smaller coalition partners to stay afloat.In some ways, this is nothing new: The military is Pakistan’s most powerful institution and has directly ruled the country for large parts of its seven-decade history. Yet it’s a far cry from the “New Pakistan” Khan promised when he took office back in 2018.“By appointing an increasing number of current and retired military officials in key positions, the government is ceding what little space civilians had in developing and executing policy in the country,” Uzair Younus, non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said by phone. “The military’s overt and covert role in governance continues to grow.”Key RolesMany in Pakistan can see the shift during government virus briefings on state television, in which uniformed current army officers are seen assisting the government’s pandemic response. Retired lieutenant general Asim Saleem Bajwa is now Khan’s communication adviser and also oversees the implementation of about $60 billion in Pakistan investments as part of China’s Belt-and-Road Initiative.At least 12 army loyalists in the cabinet also took part in dictator-turned-President Pervez Musharraf’s administration, which ended in 2008. That includes Interior Minister Ijaz Shah and Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, Khan’s finance adviser.The greater military involvement even has the support of civilian government advisers such as Zaigham Rizvi, member of Naya Pakistan Housing Program taskforce in charge of running Khan’s main economic project of building low-cost houses. Two army officers were appointed to the body last month.“There was a feeling that if we give the majority leadership to the army, the army has a good system,” said Rizvi, who worked at World Bank for 10 years as an housing expert. “They get things done.”Pakistan’s army declined to comment. Nadeem Afzal Chan, a spokesman for Khan, wasn’t immediately available, while Information Minister Syed Shibli Faraz didn’t respond to a request for a comment.Economic DistressKhan has long dismissed allegations that he was too close to the military, saying in 2017 ahead of his election win that any notion that he’s an army stooge was a “bizarre conspiracy.” Last year he told local media “the army is standing with me.”Yet economic distress from the pandemic is again raising tensions. Pakistan is the most infected nation in Asia after India, with more than 108,000 coronavirus cases and about 2,200 deaths.The economy is forecast to contract for the first time in 68 years, with the central bank expecting the economy to shrink 1.5% in the year ending June. The nation received an emergency loan of $1.4 billion from the International Monetary Fund in April, and is among countries seeking debt relief.Questions over the army’s role in running the government came to the fore when the virus started escalating in March. While Khan addressed the nation and urged citizens to remain calm, it was the army spokesman who announced the lockdown the next day. Most of the press statements from the country’s virus nerve center, chaired by Planning Minister Asad Umar, are produced by the army’s media wing -- complete with its byline and logo.On March 24, Khan was visibly annoyed when reporters asked him “who is in charge here?” Although there was no reference to the military, he threatened to leave abruptly.Then in late May, his aviation minister, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, defended the national carrier’s performance and its military leadership following a passenger plane crash in the financial capital, Karachi. “It’s not a crime to appoint people affiliated to the military,” he said.Diminishing PowerKhan’s hold on power will likely continue to diminish as current and retired army officers, as well as army-backed political appointees, assume more executive authority, said Arif Rafiq, president of New York-based Vizier Consulting, a risk advisory firm focused on the Middle East and South Asia. He noted Khan will come under further pressure as Pakistan’s economic challenges continue to mount.“The army has signaled its dissatisfaction with Khan’s handling of the coronavirus lockdowns -- there are also indications that the army has not been happy with the handling of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as well as governance in Punjab, the largest province,” Rafiq said. “We’ve seen the chief military spokesman openly push for a tougher lockdown and a retired army officer assume roles as a government spokesman and top CPEC administrator.”The military last year had already begun taking a more active role in policy making beyond foreign and national security policy, with Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa meeting top business leaders privately to find ways to boost the economy. The country’s Parliament adopted a law in January giving Bajwa a three-year extension starting from November 2019 and he was also made a member of a government’s economic board.While many democracies appoint retired military officers to senior government positions, it becomes a problem if the civilians aren’t calling the shots, according to Michael Kugelman, a Washington, D.C. based South Asia senior associate at The Wilson Center.“And herein lies the risk to democracy,” he said. “If retired generals are more influenced by their former bosses than by their current bosses, then democracy is not being properly served.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/army-tightens-grip-on-pakistan-as-imran-khan-s-popularity-wanes/story-8SwnFXn3TlQ3r1EnQOu7rL.html
10-06-2020||World||Europe reopens borders amid worst global recession in memory||The world faces the worst global recession in nearly a century, a key economic body warned Wednesday, while in Europe, restrictions to fight the spread of coronavirus portend a bleak summer tourism season even as more nations announced plans to welcome visitors again.Beginning June 16, Austria will open up to all European neighbors with the exception of Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Britain, meaning that visitors from 31 countries will no longer be required to undergo a two-week quarantine upon arrival. Greece, another European holiday hot spot, will allow tourists to fly to Athens or the main northern city of Thessaloniki beginning on June 15.But that’s hoping people have money to spend.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday that global economic output could fall by as much as 7.6% this year if a second wave of infections emerges, with the pandemic’s economic impact expected to be even harsher in Europe because of the continent’s strict and relatively lengthy coronavirus lockdowns.In the eurozone, which includes the 19 European Union nations that use the common euro currency, GDP is expected to plunge 11.5% this year in case of a second wave and by over 9% even if another round of infections is avoided.“Now we’re in the midst of ... perhaps the most global health, economic and social crisis and it’s simply the most severe any of us have ever witnessed,” OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria said during the presentation of the report in Paris. He named tourism and air travel among the “critical” sectors hard hit by the pandemic and urged countries to cooperate in developing and fairly distributing a vaccine for the virus.“As long as a virus is widespread somewhere, the threat will remain everywhere and economic costs will persist as some borders remain closed,” Gurria said, with the report predicting that the crisis would leave “long-lasting scars,” including lower living standards, high unemployment and weak investment.The virus has infected 7.2 million people worldwide and killed nearly 412,000, about 180,000 of them in Europe, according to official figures tallied by Johns Hopkins University. The true toll is believed to be much higher because many people died without being tested.Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said the border with Italy to the south would be open without conditions on June 16 but that a travel warning for Austrian citizens was still in place for Italy’s northern region of Lombardy. That region, the epicenter of Italy’s epidemic, has still been showing triple-digit growth in daily infections while much of the rest of the country counts a handful or fewer.While Italy opened its own borders on June 3, Austria’s reluctance to open their shared border has been a sore spot between the two.Austrian Health Minister Rudolf Anschober said restrictions would remain in place for Spain because its own borders remain closed until July 1 for most tourists and for Portugal due to an increase in infections in recent days.‘’Please pack your bags, but don’t forget the situation at home,’’ Anschober said, emphasizing that the virus remains in circulation. ‘’Please consider every trip, whether with the family and on business, and when possible don’t travel.’’Italy’s Coldiretti farm lobby said the Austrian border opening was critical to Italian tourism, which normally registers summer holiday visits by 3.4 million Austrians and 7 million Germans who cross Austria to reach Italy. Coldiretti called Austria’s move “an important signal.” Foreign visitors spent 167 billion euros ($190 billion) last year in Italy, a third of it on food.Contract workers from France’s all-important food, catering and events industry held a protest Wednesday between the Louvre Museum and Champs-Elysees, saying the virus pandemic is killing their jobs. The symbolic flash mob demonstration included about 30 people dressed in black, simulating strangulation with their ties and putting signs reading “sentenced to death” into a coffin.To the south, Spain’s sunny, beautiful Balearic Islands will allow thousands of German tourists to fly in for a two-week trial that tests out how to balance the needs of Spain’s vital tourism industry with new regulations to curb the country’s coronavirus outbreak.The trial that begins June 15 comes before the archipelago and the rest of the country re-open to international tourism on July 1. The Spanish government is under heavy pressure to re-activate an industry that generates 12% of Spain’s GDP and provides 2.6 million much-needed jobs.Hungary said beginning Friday it would fully reopen its borders with Croatia, whose beaches on the Adriatic Coast are a favored destination.Greece will allow international flights to land at regional airports beginning July 1. Visitors arriving from airports not on the European air safety agency list of at-risk regions will be subjected to random spot coronavirus tests but will not face the mandatory testing and quarantine now in place for all international travelers.In some other countries, uncertainty about the tourist season remained.Germany announced it is prolonging its travel warning for more than 160 countries outside Europe until the end of August even as it ends border controls for most EU citizens. Last week, Germany downgraded its travel warning for the rest of the 27-nation EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Britain.Britain said Wednesday it was planning to re-open zoos, safari parks and drive-in theaters next Monday as it eases lockdown measures. But that is mostly for local tourists only, since this week the government slapped a 14-day quarantine requirement on all arrivals, a move that health experts say comes too late and tourism officials fear will be devastating to their industry.Britain has nearly 41,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths, the highest death toll in Europe.In Buglaria a rise in infections prompted the government to prolong its state of emergency to the end of June, while in Moscow, the mayor said it will take the Russian capital about two months to lift all of its coronavirus restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-reopens-borders-amid-worst-global-recession-in-memory/story-Jednt76Rj5pEOgHEeO1s6I.html
10-06-2020||World||People with HIV more likely to die if infected with coronavirus, data shows||People with HIV are almost three times more likely to die if they contract the coronavirus than those with no co-morbidities, irrespective of whether they are taking anti-AIDS drugs, an analysis of South African data shows.The finding was made by the Western Cape Department of Health, which oversees medical services in the province with about two thirds of South Africa’s almost 53,000 confirmed coronavirus infections. It considered almost 13,000 cases, including 435 deaths, to produce what it says is the first analysis of the interplay between HIV and the Covid-19.Still, the impact HIV had on mortality was less than expected and well below that of other co-morbidities such as diabetes, although it was higher than tuberculosis, the department said in a presentation. South Africa has the world’s biggest HIV epidemic.“We have been able to quantify the effect of HIV and TB, which until now we haven’t known and we might have expected that effect to really be very large,” said Mary Ann-Davies, director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research at the University of Cape Town, who spoke on behalf of the health department. “In fact what we are seeing is fairly modest.”The high prevalence of HIV and TB in South Africa was seen as a potential vulnerability for the country when the coronavirus struck, with concern it would exacerbate death rates. About 7.8 million people in South Africa are infected with HIV, which causes AIDS, while about 300,000 have TB.Epidemiologists had expected that people on anti-AIDS drugs would be less affected than those with HIV who take no treatment, as is the case with influenza.A person carrying HIV is 2.75 times more likely to die when infected with the coronavirus than someone with no co-morbidities, according to the presentation. The ratio for someone with active TB is 2.58 times, while someone who has recovered from TB, which causes lasting lung damage, has a ratio of 1.41.Still, a Covid-19 patient with uncontrolled diabetes is 13 times more likely to die, the department said. Those with well-controlled diabetes still carry a risk of 4.65.While the department said that about 8% of coronavirus deaths in its dataset could be linked to HIV, more work needs to be done to “disentangle” the effects of obesity and poverty. People with HIV in South Africa also tend to be relatively young, which gives them some protection against the disease, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-with-hiv-more-likely-to-die-if-infected-with-coronavirus-data-shows/story-v5hHdLXHSRQmGDWjWZz26O.html

But schools didn’t have enough space to address social distancing requirements.Johnson is expected to make the announcement later Wednesday.His Downing Street Office says it hopes that reopening of safari parks and zoos will help families spend time outdoors, where the chance of catching the virus is much lower.London Zoo and other attractions across the country had warned they faced permanent closure if something weren’t done soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-reopen-zoos-safari-parks-but-no-schools/story-9k1SqLsjgcybgJebFsL7yM.html

They would mark the final stage of testing of the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness.Three ProjectsModerna Inc.’s vaccine will be the first in July, followed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca PLC’s shot in August and Johnson & Johnson’s jab in September. A Moderna spokesman confirmed the plan, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman couldn’t confirm the start date and a J&J spokesman declined to comment to Dow Jones.Fauci, the head of the infectious disease agency since 1984, has emerged early on as one of the leading voices in the battle by President Donald Trump’s administration against the pandemic. His statements have sometime run counter to the president’s on topics such as when and whether restrictions should be eased, and he and the White House virus task force have recently been sidelined with fewer appearances before the media.The US has more coronavirus cases than any other country, with about 2 million, and leads the world in pandemic deaths with more than 112,000. Meanwhile, as states such as New Jersey lift stay-at-home orders, Trump has cheered the revival of US employment numbers and stock-market gains.More than 100 vaccines are in development against the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-pandemic-is-far-from-over-anthony-fauci-warns/story-wrjxxGVAEThZbDjIFNp3AM.html

Should the Covid-19 pandemic worsen, its effect might approach that of the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which had a CFR of more than 2% and caused 50–100 million deaths worldwide,” Gao and his fellow researchers argued in the paper, which was published on June 6.The paper is titled: “Active case finding with case management: the key to tackling the Covid-19 pandemic”Since WHO characterised the Covid-19 epidemic as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the situation has been worsening.By May 31, 2020, more than 200 countries and areas had been affected and the cumulative number of cases – by June 9 – had exceeded 7.3 million, with rapid daily increases in some countries.While China has brought the outbreak under control since it first broke out from the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, Gao and his colleagues had a note of caution.China continues to be at risk of facing a second wave of the coronavirus epidemic as the nearly the entire population of the country remains susceptible to the virus, the study said.The containment and suppression strategies implemented by the government have been successful but the resurgence of the virus remains a possibility as the pandemic rages globally, it said.“The containment strategy has largely been successful in China. From April 1 to May 31, 2020, there have been, on average, 54 infections reported daily by China’s National Health Commission, which were almost all importation cases or second-generation cases from importations, and an average of 0·6 new deaths have been reported each day, with the most recent death reported on April 14, 2020,” the paper said.“There is no known ongoing community transmission, but the risk of local transmission introduced by internationally imported cases remains a major concern. Almost the entire population of China remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and, therefore, is at risk of a Covid-19 epidemic,” the paper added.The research indicated that China’s goal in combating Covid-19 is to maintain zero or minimal local transmission until a safe and effective vaccine is developed and widely distributed among the susceptible population.The authors argued only implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) without case finding, isolation and contact tracing will not be enough.“Experience with influenza A (commonly known as the flu) is that NPIs (without case finding, isolation, and contact tracing) can reduce spread by up to 50%, which is potentially insufficient to alleviate critical medical needs caused by the Covid-19 epidemic.”“With ongoing virus transmission, the Covid-19 pandemic might continue indefinitely until relieved by an effective vaccine response.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-kill-50-100-million-like-1918-influenza-pandemic-did-lancet-paper/story-KoTdvpnfOWC63xfVMyENhK.html

10-06-2020||World||UK electricity goes coal-free for record 2 months||For the first time since coal was used to produce electricity in the 1880s, Britain has produced energy without coal for two consecutive months – no coal was burnt since the midnight of April 9, official sources said on Wednesday.Business secretary Alok Sharma said: “We have just marked a major milestone for clean energy in the UK – 2 months since we used coal to generate electricity. Our use of coal for electricity had fallen from 70% in 1990 to 3% today”.The milestone was aided by lower demand for electricity during lockdown announced by the Boris Johnson government to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Fossil fuels have accounted for a dwindling percentage of sources, as reliance grows on renewables and nuclear energy in recent decades.The UK currently has four coal-fired power stations in Yorkshire, two in Nottinghamshire and one in County Atrim, which have not been in operation since April 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-electricity-goes-coal-free-for-record-2-months/story-V8l9jqzwSXXfwEhqt4HRdK.html

The hearing will also provide a platform for House Republicans, who have responded to protests by underscoring their support for police and accusing Democrats of wanting to cut off police funding, which top Democrats oppose. “Where you demonize the police, they stop engaging with the community. If we stand with the police, it will be better for all Americans,” Representative Matt Gaetz, a House Judiciary Republican, tweeted on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-s-brother-to-address-us-house-panel-on-police-reforms/story-SU3n8hKzgs3hYepFGt3NwL.html
10-06-2020||World||Missouri girl prompts Merriam-Webster to update dictionary entry on ‘racism’||Twenty-two-year-old Drake University graduate Kennedy Mitchum had little idea that her email to Merriam-Webster dictionary will prompt the company to update its entry on the word ‘racism’.According to reports, Mitchell who is a person of colour and hails from Florissant, Missouri, US, wrote to the company last month and was shocked to get a reply stating that the dictionary entry will be updated accordingly. Merriam-Webster’s first dictionary definition of ‘racism’ goes like, “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race”. In her letter, Mitchum reasoned that the current definition stands little for what is currently happening across the world and is inadequate. She received an email the very next morning with an assurance that the latest definition is being drafted and will be updated soon. “It’s not just disliking someone because of their race,” she said in her email.Also read: Black Lives Matter - protesters heartened by swift reform, but vow broader changeAlumna Kennedy Mitchum knew there was more to racism than what appeared in @MerriamWebster's dictionary."It’s not just disliking someone because of their race," she said.

10-06-2020||World||Coronavirus triggered century’s worst global recession without a second wave||The virus crisis has triggered the worst global recession in nearly a century -- and the pain is not over yet even if there is no second wave of infections, an international economic report warned Wednesday.Hundreds of millions of people have lost their jobs, and the crisis is hitting the poor and young people the hardest, worsening inequalities, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest analysis of global economic data.“It is probably the most uncertain and dramatic outlook since the creation of the OECD,” Secretary General Angel Gurria said. “We cannot make projections as as we normally do.”In the best-case scenario, if there is no second wave of infections, the agency forecast a global drop in economic output of 6% this year, and a rise of 2.8% next year.If the coronavirus re-emerges later in the year, however, the global economy could shrink 7.6%, the OECD said.“With or without a second outbreak, the consequences will be severe and long-lasting,” the report says.Gurria argued that “presenting the problem as the choice between lives and livelihoods, meaning a choice between health and the economy, is a false dilemma. If the pandemic is not brought under control, there will be no robust economic recovery.”In case of a second wave of contagions, the OECD forecast that the average unemployment rate across the 37 developed countries that it represents would double this year to 10% and see “little recovery” in 2021. In the more optimistic scenario, the figure would be 9.2%. In poorer countries, the numbers are often higher, and informal workers are especially vulnerable.The agency urged governments to tackle inequalities by investing in health care systems, global cooperation on medical supplies, vaccine and treatments and retraining people whose sectors are the hardest-hit.The virus has infected 7.2 million people worldwide and killed at least 411,000, according to official figures tallied by Johns Hopkins University. The true toll is believed to be much higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-triggered-worst-global-recession-without-a-second-wave/story-kWwBSu1oGpG7eK13VWlv9O.html
10-06-2020||World||South Korea to charge defector groups over North leaflets||South Korea’s government said Wednesday that it will press charges against two activist groups that have been floating anti-Pyongyang leaflets and bottles filled with rice to North Korea.Any action against the groups is likely to trigger a debate over freedom of expression in South Korea, and whether President Moon Jae-in’s liberal government is sacrificing democratic principles to keep alive his ambitions for inter-Korean engagement.The announcement by Seoul’s Unification Ministry came a day after North Korea said it was cutting off all communication channels with South Korea over its inability to prevent North Korean defectors and other activists from flying the leaflets across the border.One of the targeted defector-activists condemned what he described as a “treacherous” move by Seoul and vowed to launch even more leaflets across the border in coming weeks, using not only balloons but also drones.Yoh Sang-key, the ministry’s spokesman, told reporters the two organizations facing charges had “created tensions between the South and North and brought danger to the lives and safety of (South Korean) residents in border areas.”The ministry said last week that the government would push new laws to ban activists from flying the leaflets across the border, after the North threatened to end an inter-Korean military agreement reached in 2018 to reduce tensions if Seoul failed to prevent the protests.Aside from severing government and military communication channels, the North also said it would permanently shut down a liaison office and a factory park in the border town of Kaesong, which have been major symbols of reconciliation.For years, activists have floated huge balloons into North Korea carrying leaflets criticizing leader Kim Jong Un over his nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record. The leafleting has sometimes triggered a furious response from North Korea, which bristles at any attempt to undermine its leadership.In 2014, soldiers exchanged fire after South Korean activists released propaganda balloons across the Demilitarized Zone, but no casualties were reported.While Seoul has sometimes sent police officers to block the activists during sensitive times, it had previously resisted North Korea’s calls to fully ban them, saying they were exercising their freedom.Yoh said that the two groups, led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak and his brother Park Jung-oh, violated a law governing inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation by sending unauthorized materials to the North. The ministry confirmed it was the first time the law, which is designed to prevent South Korean organizations from providing unauthorized goods to North Korea, was being used against defectors’ anti-Pyongyang activities.Park Sang-hak’s Fighters for a Free North Korea has launched balloons with anti-Pyongyang leaflets for years. Park Jung-oh leads the group Keun Saem, which on Monday unsuccessfully tried to float rice-filled bottles into North Korea from a border town before being blocked by South Korean police.“Since when has the Ministry of Unification become the ministry of treason?” Park Sang-hak told The Associated Press. “We will respond not with words but with action, by flying even more leaflets to North Korean people.”Park said he will also try to use drones so that he “could drop the leaflets on Kim Jong Un’s head.” He didn’t say when the launches will happen, but that he was ready “whenever the winds are good.”The ministry didn’t say whether it was planning to take similar legal action against another group led by Lee Min-bok, also a North Korean defector who has been flying leaflets into the North for years.Experts say North Korea’s move to cut off communication channels was likely more than just about leafleting as it comes after months of frustration over Seoul’s unwillingness to defy U.S.-led sanctions and resume inter-Korean economic projects that would breathe life into the North’s broken economy.North Korea has suspended virtually all cooperation with South Korea in recent months amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations with Washington. The talks faltered last year with the Americans rejecting the North’s demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.South Korea’s government and military said officials tried to contact their North Korean counterparts via several channels after the North’s announcement on Tuesday but got no answer. Yoh said Wednesday his ministry will stop trying before the Koreas agree to resume the channels.The liaison office in Kaesong has been closed since late January after the Koreas agreed to temporarily shut it until the Covid-19 pandemic is controlled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-to-charge-defector-groups-over-north-leaflets/story-u8S2o3Vc1nAT4nBprVtWuL.html
10-06-2020||World||Hong Kong fears oblivion under Chinese dominion||Hong Kong, despite assurances to the contrary from its government and Beijing, is facing an oppressive future as a satellite city of China, one where secret police operate with impunity and the territory’s residents live in perpetual fear.This stems from China’s sudden and unexpected decision in May’s National People’s Congress (NPC) to unilaterally impose national security legislation on Hong Kong. It comes after the territory failed to introduce such an article to its Basic Law mini-constitution in the 23 years since the handover. Ironically, that national security law supposed to be passed by Hong Kong itself is called Article 23.Now, to complete the numerological symmetry, this law foisted onto Hong Kong by Chairman Xi Jinping is likely to be unanimously passed and implemented before the end of this month.This “National People’s Congress Law Concerning Establishing and Strengthening the Safeguarding of National Security for Hong Kong” proscribes any action of “treason, secession, sedition or subversion”. Of course, interpretation of these cardinal sins will be ambiguous so China can interpret them according to its whim.The events of last year, where masses took to the streets to express their displeasure at Chief Executive Carrie Lam and her puppet-like compliance with Xi’s dictates, alarmed Beijing. Somewhat absurdly, there is nothing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) fears more than the will of the people.This new law is likely to be more draconian than any Article 23. Frighteningly, the draft law stated, “When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People’s Government will set up agencies in the HKSAR to fulfill relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law.” This means the Ministry of State Security, China’s version of the Gestapo, will become legally resident.China will doubtlessly also see fit to “improve” Hong Kong’s legal system, where the rule of law still prevails and courts are not yet subservient to the government. Already, peaceful avenues for Hong Kong people to air discontent are rapidly diminishing - whether protests, polls, vigils or in the legislature. These opportunities will be further constricted and crushed under the new law.Journalists, protestors, human rights activists, pro-democracy political groups, NGO activists, missionaries and religious groups all have much to fear. They are liable to be treated the same way in Hong Kong as they are in China, which is detention and imprisonment.Joshua Rosenzweig, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for East and South East Asia, warned, “This dangerous proposed law sends the clearest message yet that it is eager to do the same in Hong Kong, and as soon as possible. The Hong Kong government has progressively embraced the Mainland’s vague and all-encompassing definition of ‘national security’ to restrict freedom of association, expression and the right to peaceful assembly.”Responding to a question from ANI, Dennis Kwok, a Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker, was asked to envision what Hong Kong might soon look like. A chilling scenario could see Chinese security agents breaking down citizens’ doors, all protests banned, extradition of dissenters to China, reporters detained, people with business or personal contacts overseas come under intense scrutiny to counter the vague notion of “foreign interference”, and children being brainwashed at school.When presented with such a scenario, Kwok responded: “I don’t think you have to wait five years. I think it could be next year when what you described becomes reality. We know national security agents are already in Hong Kong. They’re not operating openly but they’re here; we all know that. Will they start arresting people and taking them across to China? I don’t know. I wouldn’t want to make that kind of prediction, because a lot of people would have to leave Hong Kong.”Kwok continued, “There’s talk about whether the national security law will have retroactive consequences, but we don’t know. Because if there is going to be a retrospective effect of criminal sanctions, which is a breach of all human rights that we have in Hong Kong, this means Hong Kong people will be living in fear and will have to leave. Millions have protested or joined peaceful assemblies or said things on Facebook that could be used against them. So that will really drive fear through the whole community and there may be a mass exodus. I don’t know.”Another question is whether Hong Kong courts will oversee these laws or will they become the jurisdiction of harsh Chinese puppet courts, which are controlled by the CCP and where convictions for political offense are a foregone conclusion.Kwok fully expects to be barred from running in upcoming Legislative Council elections, if they go ahead, as part of a crackdown against pro-democracy candidates and leading lights. Once considered a moderate pro-democracy candidate, Beijing has blacklisted him.Participating in a webinar hosted by the Lowy Institute in Australia, Kwok complained that “they’re making this law in Beijing with almost zero input from people in Hong Kong, bypassing all our institutions and the Legislative Council”.He said China’s decision to impose this law on Hong Kong makes a mockery of One Country, Two Systems. “If they can enact laws like that, they won’t stop at national security. It’ll be national education next month and then something else the other ... Everyone in their right mind sees this as the end of One Country, Two Systems if they do it this way. I don’t have to tell you how they interpret national security in the Mainland.”Kwok lamented: “We all knew from the beginning that One Country, Two Systems is an inherent contradiction, and it will only work if there is respect between the two systems ... They have torn down that respect for difference and only emphasize One Country; you hear from Mainland officials saying all the time in the past few years that One Country trumps Two Systems. Now if they insist on that mentality, they are not only deviating from the original idea that was founded by Deng Xiaoping, but if there’s no respect for the two different systems, it’s never going to work.“We can see it now where they’re basically saying, ‘Enough is enough, our patience is running out, you’ve crossed the red line of the Central People’s Government’ ... but they never bother to think about the bottom line of the Hong Kong people.” Kwok was referring to the promise of universal suffrage when voting for the city’s leaders.“And now they even say to the international community that the Sino-British Joint Declaration is just a piece of paper, that there’s no obligation, no promise arising from it and that the British government should just back off. This is how they see their international obligation...”Indeed, China’s treatment and dismissal of a signed treaty deposited with the United Nations says a lot about its attitude to other formal commitments as well. For example, China eviscerated the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s decision on a case brought against it regarding Beijing’s excessive claims in the South China Sea.Kwok has no illusions as to the trustworthiness of his mother country. “China is showing its true colors to the world. Ten years ago they still paid lip service to human rights, the rule of law, but now they’re not paying lip service anymore. They’re saying, ‘This is who we are. If you don’t like it, get out of our way or, if not, we’re going to threaten you with consequences.”“The whole strategy of Beijing has changed,” Kwok declared.The USA is likely to enact sanctions and remove Hong Kong’s favored status. Many are encouraging countries like Australia, the UK and USA to open up ways for Hong Kong people to emigrate. However, the large wave of emigration from Hong Kong in the period leading up to the 1997 handover is unlikely. Kwok said, “A lot of people around me are thinking about having options, having an exit plan, but a lot of them don’t want to leave because it is not easy to leave your hometown.”Yet any country that does offer sanctuary must encounter bullying from China. “A lot of people are realizing this is the consequence of having an assertive global power which is an authoritarian regime ... You have to choose fighting for your values of democracy, freedom and rule of law ... You need to make a choice as a people and country.”As part of the media blitz bolstering Beijing’s plans, the Officer of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on 25 May: “In short, here are five key messages. First, national security legislation for Hong Kong is right and proper and of greatest urgency. Second, it is just and legitimate for the Central Government to safeguard national security, which is both within its power and its obligation. Third, national security legislation will ensure the enduring success of ‘One Country, Two Systems’. Fourth, the international community can rest assured about the legislation for Hong Kong. And fifth, the Chinese government is rock-firm in upholding national sovereignty, security and development interests.”Lam and other Hong Kong leaders insist that ordinary citizens have nothing to fear from the law,but there is a curious irony in all this. She said, for example, “The legislation to be enacted for the HKSAR to safeguard national security aims to prevent, curb and sanction an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security, safeguarding the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and maintaining ‘One Country, Two Systems’. It will not affect the legitimate rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents.”Yet at the same time, Lam admits she has not seen the law nor knows any of its intimate details. Thus, she is reassuring everyone not to worry about a law that she knows nothing about. This is absurd, and simply reflects her toeing the party line.It needs to be asked, why now? Of course, with the NPC having met last month, this was the first opportunity for such a law to be tabled and rubberstamped.However, beyond that, two key reasons are likely. One is that the world is currently distracted by COVID-19, so there is less international scrutiny. The Chinese government is reluctant to let a good crisis go to waste, so Beijing obviously felt now was a good time to rush the bill through. Another factor is the steadily worsening US-China relationship, so China may as well do it now because there is not that much to lose given the current deterioration.With Legislative Council elections scheduled for September, Beijing is rightfully fearful of a defeat at the ballot boxes. It is thus doing all it can to regain a lead by arresting or disqualifying opponents, and the term “terrorist” is being freely applied to protestors. Luo Huining, renowned as a disciplinarian, took up the post of director of the Liaison Office in January, and he is exerting a strong hand too.Already, more than 9,000 protestors have been arrested since mid-2019, with more than 1,200 charged. Yet every time Beijing and the Hong Kong government un-glove their iron fist, it further deepens the divide that has beset society. Beijing does not understand that the more it squeezes Hong Kong, the more it crystallizes and solidifies resistance. What Beijing sought to eliminate - grassroots criticism and resistance to the CCP - it has single-handedly helped to instigate.China will be going all out to indoctrinate the new generation of Hong Kong youth too. It is already lining up teachers to go to there to sing the CCP’s praises and inculcate “patriotism”.The reality is that protestors are fighting a rear-guard action. They have little hope of stemming the inexorable tide of an incensed authoritarian China. Hong Kong’s exclusive connections with the West, and the people’s aspiration for greater autonomy, have turned it into a battlefield against Xi’s xenophobic policies.Xi has prioritized his nationalist and authoritarian agenda above Hong Kong’s value as a financial center. The territory has entered a countdown, never to be the same again. Xi no longer wants or needs it as a buffer zone, and instead he senses the danger of foreign ideas such as democracy diffusing from there into China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-fears-oblivion-under-chinese-dominion/story-usaakwy6v3Cr0d5LE1WgbO.html
10-06-2020||World||Kim Yo Jong emerges as policymaker in spat with South Korea||The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is taking a leading role in a new, more hard-line pressure campaign against South Korea, highlighting what analysts say is a substantive policy role that goes beyond being her brother’s assistant.Believed to be in her early 30s, Kim Yo Jong is the only close relative of the North Korean leader to play a public role in politics. During the 2018-2019 flurry of international diplomacy, Kim Yo Jong garnered global attention by leading a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Later, she was often seen dashing about to make sure everything went well for her older brother, including holding an ashtray for him at a train station on his way to a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Vietnam.But this year, Kim has taken on a more public policy role, cementing her status as an influential political player in her own right.“Prior to this, Kim Yo Jong was portrayed in state media as Kim Jong Un’s sister, his protocol officer, or one of his accompanying officials,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former North Korea open source intelligence analyst in the U.S. government. “Now, North Koreans know for sure there is more to her than that.”Kim has worked behind the scenes in North Korea’s propaganda agencies, a role that led the United States to add her to a list of sanctioned senior officials in 2017 because of human rights abuses and censorship.In March, state media carried the first ever statement by Kim, in which she criticised South Korean authorities. That was followed by several more, including a response to comments by Trump, and last week, a warning that the North would cut communications with South Korea.Lee said Kim’s statements have a unique style, showcasing her wit and underscoring her powerful position.“In addition to the harsh words and sarcasm, they can be bitingly witty in ways that the other statements are not,” Lee said. “She seems to have more leeway in crafting her statements, which of course is not surprising.”When state media announced on Tuesday that the hotlines between North and South Korea would be severed, they said Kim Yo Jong and a longtime hard-liner, Kim Yong Chol, championed the decision at a meeting.This rare explanation of a policymaking process portrayed Kim Yo Jong as “a very substantive person,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Centre, a U.S.-based think tank. Madden said this new portrayal of Kim in state media may be a subtle dig at international analysts who have cast doubts on her ability to wield influence in the North’s male-dominated society.“They clearly have high hopes and expectations for her,” he said. “Not necessarily the next leader, but something of a king maker nonetheless.” (Reporting by Josh Smith.

According to the Ministry of National Health Services, 83 more Covid-19 patients died during the same period, taking the death toll to 2,255 and 5,387 new patients were detected in the last 24 hours.A total of 36,308 patients have also recovered so far from the disease across the country, the ministry said.Out of the total 113,702 cases, Punjab has registered 43,460 patients, Sindh 41,303, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 14,527, Balochistan 7,031, Islamabad 5,963, Gilgit-Baltistan 974 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 444.The ministry said that 23,799 tests were done in the last 24 hours, taking the tally of total tests in the country to 754,252.The virus is spreading fast but the government has refused a proposal by the World Health Organisation to follow the “intermittent lockdown” policy of two-week lockdown followed by two-week relaxation on alternate basis. In a letter to Punjab province Health Minister Yasmin Rashid dated June 7, WHO Country Head, Pakistan, Dr Palitha Mahipala said the coronavirus has spread to almost all districts in the country with big cities making up the majority of the cases.Mahipala has recommended an “intermittent lockdown” approach.However, advisor on Health Zafar Mirza told the media that “no such policy is under consideration”.The WHO country head pointed out that after the partial relaxation on May 1, and complete relaxation on May 22 the infection rate has increased on both occasions.Pakistan had lifted the virus restrictions in view of an under-control rate of transmission and the health system’s ability to “detect, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pakistan-records-highest-single-day-spike-of-5-387-cases/story-KY3ViEsLSwtUE0vh5mRWYM.html

US ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, “intends to resume operations in Wuhan in the near future”, Frank Witaker, minister counsellor for Public Affairs at the embassy, said in an email to Reuters, without giving a specific date.The US State Department withdrew consulate staff and their families in late January after the Chinese government put the city under lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. Wuhan, a central Chinese city with a population of about 11 million, has accounted for the majority of China’s coronavirus cases and deaths, though the epidemic has since subsided there and in other parts of the country.Since apparently jumping to people in a Wuhan market selling wildlife, the coronavirus has spread globally, infecting more than 7 million people and killing more than 410,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-consulate-in-china-s-wuhan-to-reopen-in-near-future/story-mhpFrYWcIGylevfSPcWuDL.html
10-06-2020||World||Sweden halts probe into 1986 murder of former Prime Minister Olof Palme||Sweden on Wednesday dropped its investigation into the unsolved murder of former Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, who was shot dead 34 years ago in downtown Stockholm.The case’s chief prosecutor, Krister Petersson, said the case was being closed because the main suspect, Stig Engstrom, had died in 2000.Palme was gunned down on Feb. 28, 1986, after he and his wife Lisbet Palme left a movie theater in the Swedish capital.Petersson said Engstrom, also known as the Skandiamannen for working in the nearby Skandia insurance company, had a strong dislike of Palme and his policies. He was one of the first at the murder scene and was briefly considered a possible suspect.“Since he has died, I cannot indict him,” Petersson told a news conference.Several other witnesses gave descriptions of the fleeing killer that matched Engstrom while others said he wasn’t even at the scene. Engstrom himself claimed to have been present from the beginning, spoke to Lisbet Palme and police, and attempted to resuscitate the victim.Soon after the murder, Engstrom appeared in Swedish media and developed an increasingly detailed story of his involvement in the events and criticized the police. He claimed those witnesses who had described the killer had in fact been describing him, running to catch up with police officers in pursuit of the assassin.The police then labelled Engstrom as a unreliable and inconsistent witness and classified him as a person of no interest.Palme sought to live as ordinary a life as possible and would often go out without any bodyguards. The night of the murder, he had no protection.Lisbet Palme was injured in the attack and later identified the shooter as Christer Pettersson, an alcoholic and drug addict, who was convicted of Palme’s murder. The sentence was later overturned after police failed to produce any technical evidence against him, leaving the murder an unsolved mystery. Pettersson died in 2004.Palme, who cut a flamboyant, even boyish figure, had an aristocratic background but was known for his left-leaning views. He was eyed with suspicion in conservative circles and by the United States. Among Swedes and in the Nordic region, he was much loved, but also hated.More than 100 people have been suspected of the crime and the unsolved case has been surrounded by conspiracy theories, ranging from foreign involvement, people with right-wing sympathies within Sweden’s police, to an act by a lone shooter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sweden-halts-probe-into-1986-murder-of-former-prime-minister-olof-palme/story-OiTVUY46866xu5zzCAq9CL.html

Adidas AG’s Reebok also said it would end its longtime sponsorship of the CrossFit Games after the event in 2020, according to Footwear News.Documented by cell phone video, Floyd’s death has sparked more than a week of demonstrations in more than 150 cities around the US, with protesters demanding deep reform to police practices that unfairly target black people. Protests have spread around the globe, with demonstrators from Australia and New Zealand to the United Kingdom and France are using the moment as a launching point to review their own countries’ histories of racial prejudice.The movement has also reverberated in corporate America, where many companies have signaled solidarity with the protesters. At the same time, several high-profile and senior executives have been fired or placed on leave in recent weeks, the result of growing intolerance for expressions of racism or evidence of bias. The ousters have so far been especially visible in media, with changes at the top of Bon Appetit, Refinery29, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Variety and the New York Times Opinion section.The entertainment industry, still reeling from the widespread sexual harassment scandals that brought some of Hollywood’s most powerful players, is now auditing its content -- and the people who make it.Television networks and streaming services are now reconsidering some popular classics. Netflix and the BBC pulled reruns of sketch comedy show “Little Britain” over its repeated use of blackface. HBO Max removed “Gone With the Wind,” Variety reported, though the Oscar-winning Civil War epic may later return with a note attached to explain controversies over the 1939 film’s rosy portrayal of slavery. Paramount Network canceled the long-running police reality show “Cops.”Meanwhile, four cast members from Bravo’s reality show, “The Vanderpump Rules,” have been fired, CNN reported. The CEO and co-owner of The Second City Chicago acknowledged an institutional legacy of racism at the influential comedy outpost and resigned. Hartley Sawyer, who played the Elongated Man on CW’s superhero show “The Flash,” was fired for tweets the actor later acknowledged were “hurtful and unacceptable,” according to the BBC.Glassman’s DownfallGlassman’s fall started with a June 6 reply to an Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation tweet calling racism a critical public health issue. Glassman, whose Twitter handle is @CrossFitCEO, commented on Saturday, “It’s FLOYD-19,” then went on from there.CrossFit franchisees and customers from around the US decried the sentiments as tone-deaf. The account @CrossFitFresno replied, “As a 10+ year @CrossFit affiliate that is coming out of 3 months of business closure, we are already struggling. How could you do this to your brand that we pay to be affiliated with? Please help us understand.”Glassman hasn’t tweeted since. Dave Castro was named as new CEO.CrossFit is a brand of fitness regimen that incorporates weightlifting and aerobic exercise and has spawned at least 15,000 affiliate gyms worldwide. Its vast appeal and popularity was so widespread that the company created the CrossFit Games in 2007, an annual televised competition where athletes compete for more than $2.3 million in prize money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crossfit-ceo-latest-to-be-ousted-amid-america-s-racial-reckoning/story-UwfIOuhNEeuQqtCasAQfBM.html

10-06-2020||World||United States: Two men say hospital switched them at birth 80 years ago||Two men who believe they were switched at birth nearly 80 years ago are suing a Roman Catholic diocese in West Virginia, alleging negligence and breach of duty by the hospital where they were born. John William Carr III and Jackie Lee Spencer were born on August 29, 1942, at St. Joseph Hospital in Buckhannon. The lawsuit against the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston says hospital staffers sent them home with the wrong families, The Dominion Post reported Monday. The switch was discovered last year when DNA tests showed Carr and Spencer had no genetic matches with the families that raised them but did match the other’s family, the men say in their lawsuit. Carr, Spencer and their families have suffered a “lifetime of consequences” from the switch and are seeking unspecified damages, they say in the lawsuit. The diocese does not comment on pending litigation, spokesperson Tim Bishop said. Spencer spent more than 50 years searching for the man listed on his birth certificate as his father, he says in the lawsuit. He had been told the man abandoned his mother prior to his birth. After finding relatives of the man, Spencer took a DNA test to see if he was related and discovered he was not. An additional DNA test also showed he wasn’t related to people he had grown up thinking of as blood family. It turned out, tests showed, he was really related to Carr’s family — and further digging found that Carr had been born the same day at St. Joseph. Spencer and his wife contacted Carr, who took a DNA test that showed he was related to the people Spencer had believed were relatives. Spencer, now in his twilight years, never got to know many of his family members, he says in the lawsuit. “Many of the people Jack should have known his entire life are gone,” according to the suit. “He feels as though most of his family died all at once. He grieves for the loss of the life he was supposed to have, while reconciling those feeling with the love and gratitude he feels for the family he has known his whole life.” Carr, who has blue eyes, said he looks different from the family that raised him and always felt out of place. “Well, I never felt like I fit in here because my mother and dad had brown hair and brown eyes, and so do my brother and sister,” Carr said in the lawsuit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-two-men-say-hospital-switched-them-at-birth-80-years-ago/story-0Nha2YXq6mDqENTkkSkAmO.html

10-06-2020||World||Protesters in Oxford demand removal of statue of Cecil Rhodes||Hundreds of protesters in Oxford rallied outside the university’s Oriel College on Tuesday (local time) to demand the removal of a statue of Cecil Rhodes, reported CNN.The long-running campaign to remove the statue has been reinvigorated after the recent Black Lives Matter protests across the world following the death of George Floyd, the report said.This comes a day after anti-racism protesters in the UK pulled down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol on Monday.The death of George Floyd on May 25 in the US has sparked a worldwide movement against police brutality, racism and social injustice, as a video showing a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, kneeling on Floyd’s neck after the latter had been arrested, was widely circulated online on the next day.CNN reported that members of the Oxford crowd on Tuesday took a knee, put their fists in the air and kept silent for 8 minutes and 46 seconds the amount of time Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin held his knee on Floyd’s neck. According to CNN report, Cecil Rhodes was one of the leading figures in British imperialism at the end of the 19th Century, pushing the empire to seize control over vast areas of southern Africa, first as a businessman and later as prime minister of Cape Colony in what is now South Africa.Meanwhile, nearly, two weeks after his death in Police Custody, Family and friends honoured George Floyd at a private funeral in the US city of Houston. Floyd’s casket was rolled into the church by six men wearing black suits and masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-in-oxford-demand-removal-of-statue-of-cecil-rhodes/story-CbBuJR3XbYDJ69bl3JRyVN.html
10-06-2020||World||9 countries including New Zealand are now Covid-19 free. Here’s the list||As the world continues to grapple with coronavirus pandemic with the infections crossing the seven million mark and over 400,000 deaths due to Covid-19, at least nine countries have declared themselves to be free from the virus.Here is a list of these nations:1. New ZealandOn June 8, New Zealand announced that the last of its coronavirus patients had recovered with its health officials saying there were no active cases of Covid-19 in the country. The Pacific island nation reported just over 1500 corona patients including 22 who died.The country had enforced a strict lockdown for nearly seven weeks, in which most businesses were shut and everyone except essential workers had to stay at home.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced lifting of all coronavirus measures in the country from June 9, barring border closure restrictions.2. TanzaniaTanzania’s president on Sunday claimed that his country is free of the coronavirus because of the power of prayer. However, the claim came six weeks after the African nation stopped publicly updating virus data.“Corona in our country has been removed by the powers of God,” President John Magufuli declared at a church service on Sunday.Tanzania’s number of-19 cases has been stuck at 509 for six weeks as health officials, opposition figures and some neighbouring countries worry that cases in the East African nation continue to climb.

The residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area collapsed on Sunday night. The residents of the building said the six-storey structure collapsed with a loud “thud”, which was followed by a power outage making rescue operations difficult. Till Monday, rescue teams had pulled out eight bodies and on Tuesday 11 more bodies were found in the first floor of the collapsed building. Twelve people were injured in the incident.A man, who was rescued alive from the rubble after 24 hours, died due to his injuries in the hospital, Geo TV reported. Personnel from the Army, Rangers, police and welfare associations were engaged in the rescue operation. The building, located in Liaquat Colony of Lyari, had more than 40 apartments and a penthouse on the top floor. The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) had declared it as dangerous and unstable more than two months ago.Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari expressed regret over the loss of lives in the incident.“I am with the affected families, we will not leave them alone in these difficult times,” Bilawal said.This is the third major building collapse in the country’s financial capital this year. In March, 27 people were killed and scores injured when a five-storey building fell on two adjacent structures in the city’s congested Gulbahar area.Karachi city authorities have identified over 1,500 buildings as ‘dangerous’, however little action has been taken to evacuate them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-in-the-pakistan-building-collapse-increases-to-19/story-67XucVXX6pfphMgnu6lNDO.html
10-06-2020||World||Kim Jong Un raises pressure on South Korea to split with Trump||Both North Korea and left-leaning supporters of South Korean President Moon Jae-in want him to restore economic ties broken by security tensions. But pleasing them would mean angering US President Donald Trump.On Tuesday, North Korea said it was closing down communication links set up two years ago between Moon and Kim Jong Un, jeopardizing the South Korean leader’s 2017 campaign promise to move the heavily armed rivals toward a permanent peace. It’s bad timing for Moon: His ruling bloc secured a historic supermajority in National Assembly elections in April, boosting calls within his Democratic Party to mend ties with North Korea.The problem for Moon is that he doesn’t have much he can offer North Korea without prompting a blowup from the Trump administration, which has repeatedly rejected South Korea’s calls for sanctions relief. The US has refused to relax United Nations penalties and other measures against the regime without greater commitments on arms reduction from Kim.Woo Won-shik, a senior lawmaker and a former Democratic Party floor leader, said Tuesday there was an “urgent need” to revive inter-Korean cooperation, arguing that failure to act now could further isolate North Korea and bring about a return to the brinkmanship of three years ago. Kim earlier this year said he would soon debut a “new strategic weapon” -- part of a bid to pressure Trump, who faces an election in November, back to the negotiating table.“There are many inter-Korean projects that can proceed without breaching the existing UN sanctions regime,” Woo said.The latest dust-up -- triggered by South Korean activists who sent anti-Pyongyang messages in balloons across the border -- comes ahead of the 20th anniversary of the first meeting between top leaders of the divided Koreas. The summit beginning on June 13, 2000, was the biggest moment of then-President Kim Dae-jung’s reconciliation effort that led to stepped up trade and joint projects and helped earn the South Korean leader the Nobel Peace Prize.While that “Sunshine Policy” helped cool tensions, it was also criticized for providing Pyongyang’s leaders with cash needed to build up its nuclear weapons program. Smaller measures that might allow only a trickle of foreign currency back into cash-starved North Korea also risk disappointing Kim Jong Un and Moon’s allies, who see their current strength in parliament as their best chance to secure lasting change.North Korea’s relations with Moon haven’t been the same since Trump walked out of a summit with Kim in February 2019 in Hanoi. The North Korean leader was pushing a plan backed by Seoul to give up his antiquated Yongbyon nuclear facility in exchange for sanctions relief -- an offer that came nowhere near the Trump administration’s demand for the “final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea.”“It is a sense of betrayal and disappointment,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former analyst for the US government specializing in North Korea. “Kim Jong Un feels South Korea has misled him into believing that Yongbyon facilities were going to be enough for a deal with Trump in Hanoi.”After that, North Korea has effectively ignored Moon’s requests for talks, shunned his offers for aid and test-launched new ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear payload to all parts of South Korea, where about 28,500 US military personnel are stationed.North Korea didn’t answer South Korea’s calls made on the military line Tuesday for the first time since the inter-Korean communication link was restored in 2018, defense ministry spokeswoman Choi Hyun-soo told a briefing in Seoul. “Inter-Korean communication lines are a basic means for communication and should be kept in line with inter-Korean agreements,” South Korea’s Unification Ministry said in a text message to reporters.A State Department spokesperson said the US urges North Korea to return to diplomacy and cooperation. “The United States has always supported progress in inter-Korean relations, and we are disappointed in the DPRK’s recent actions,” the spokesperson said, referring to North Korea by its formal name.Kim Jong Un may follow up his move to cut communications links with more missile tests, but making sure to avoid the wrath of Trump. The American president has brushed off shorter-range tests and credited his own diplomacy for stopping Kim from further tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of hitting the US mainland.“Provocations like missile launches will follow, but nothing as serious as an ICBM test,” said Cho Han-bum, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a state-run think tank. Cho added that North Korea also didn’t want to push Moon too far: “The South is well aware that ending the inter-Korean relations is not something that the North wants.”Moon’s government said in late May said that it wanted to try to again ease travel restrictions and inter-Korean exchanges. A similar attempt in 2018 led Trump to bluntly tell Seoul that it couldn’t do anything regarding sanctions “without our approval.”Alliance at RiskMembers of the Moon administration have hinted that Seoul could act unilaterally to resuscitate inter-Korean cooperation, but that would come with the enormous risk of cleaving Seoul from its alliance with Washington, said Soo Kim, a Rand Corp. policy analyst who specializes in Korean Peninsula issues.“President Moon can promise the North Koreans the earth, but realistically, he remains constrained in the way of practical measures South Korea can take -- if Seoul were to be conscious of and concerned about its relations with the US,” she said.South Korean proposals blocked by the Trump administration included resuming operations at a joint factory park in the North Korean border city of Kaesong and a separate resort at North Korea’s Mount Kumgang. Both were opened in the spirit of the Sunshine Policy and later shut due to political turmoil.While South Korea was able to win a UN sanctions waiver that led to the ceremonial sending of trains across the border about two years ago, its humanitarian assistance has dried up under Trump’s maximum pressure campaign. South Korea has sent more $3 billion of aid since 1995, but little of it has come under the Moon government, which sent just $12 million in 2017 and 2018, government data shows.‘Bent Over Backwards’Trade between the two nations has dropped to virtually zero from $2.7 billion in 2015, or about 10% of North Korea’s economy. The regime took a further hit this year when it sealed off its borders in January at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which slammed the brakes on other trade with countries like China.Kim Jong Un believes he doesn’t have much of anything to lose by increasing pressure on Moon, according to Duyeon Kim, a senior adviser for Northeast Asia and Nuclear Policy at the International Crisis Group.“North Korea is raising the ante, trying to further punish, scare, and force Seoul to work harder to meet Pyongyang’s demands,” Kim said. “Kim Jong Un feels he bent over backwards for Moon, but believes Seoul has not reciprocated, has betrayed North Korea and the Korean race, and has no influence over Washington to deliver on its promises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-raises-pressure-on-south-korea-to-split-with-trump/story-Uc7HEyxqDo7ylr15ytGjiM.html
10-06-2020||World||George Floyd death: New York moves towards eliminating police secrecy law||New York lawmakers striving for a new era of police accountability are poised to repeal a state law that has long kept police officers’ disciplinary records secret, one of several steps to rein in officers spurred by the national uproar over the death of George Floyd.As the state legislature worked toward eliminating the law Tuesday, New York City prosecutors moved swiftly to bring criminal charges against a police officer caught on camera shoving a protester to the ground during a demonstration in Brooklyn.Police unions declared that officers were being abandoned, and condemned lawmakers for allowing themselves to be influenced by protests in which officers were injured by thrown objects and police vehicles were burned.Eliminating the law, known as Section 50-a, would make complaints against officers, as well as transcripts and final dispositions of disciplinary proceedings, public for the first time in decades.Governer Andrew Cuomo, who has recently supported reforming the law, has said in the wake of the protests that he will sign the repeal. Only Delaware has a similar law.Momentum for ending the secrecy law reached a crescendo in recent days as marchers filled streets in Brooklyn, Manhattan and elsewhere to rally against police abuses — amplifying the calls of reform advocates who spent years pushing for change in the wake of other high-profile police killings, including that of Eric Garner in 2014.“This is no time for rejoicing,” said State Senator Kevin Parker, a Democrat representing parts of Brooklyn. “This bill has been around for over a decade … And the only reason why we’re bringing it to the floor now because the nation is burning.” The legislature on Monday passed other police accountability measures, banning police from using chokeholds, guaranteeing the right to record police activity and making it easier to file lawsuits against people making race-based 911 calls.State lawmakers Tuesday were also expected to pass bills providing all state troopers with body cameras and ensuring that officers get proper medical and mental health attention for people under arrest or in custody.As lawmakers acted on accountability legislation, NYPD Officer Vincent D’Andraia was being arraigned on assault and other charges days after a bystander recorded him pushing protester Dounya Zayer, causing her to hit her head on the pavement.D’Andraia was released after his lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. The officer was ordered to stay away from Zayer who was hospitalized after the May 29 altercation with what she said were a concussion and a seizure.“Dounya was assaulted for the very reason she was protesting, and that’s police brutality,” said Zayer’s attorney, Tahanie Aboushi, adding that D’Andraia’s supervisor should face punishment beyond an announced reassignment.“If not for this being on video it would have been business as usual for the NYPD,” Aboushi said.In a statement announcing the charges, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said he was “deeply troubled by this unnecessary assault.” Zayer, 20, called D’Andraia a coward and suggested the assault would only deepen mistrust of law enforcement.“I was protesting for a reason,” Zayer said in a video tweeted from her hospital bed. The officer, she added, “should have had the self restraint to not hurt the people he’s supposed to be protecting.” The police department suspended D’Andraia, 28, last week without pay. His lawyer, Stephen Worth, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. If convicted, he could face a year behind bars, but first-time offenders rarely see any jail time.D’Andraia is the first New York City police officer to face criminal charges over alleged misconduct exhibited during days of unrest that roiled the city in the wake of Floyd’s death in Minneapolis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-new-york-moves-towards-eliminating-police-secrecy-law/story-5MUfGfKdT5yzfGHAsWWJhP.html
10-06-2020||World||Senate confirms Gen Charles Brown Jr as first black US military service chief in unanimous vote||The Senate on Tuesday unanimously confirmed Gen. Charles Brown Jr. as chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, making him the first black officer to lead one of the nation’s military services.Vice President Mike Pence took the unusual step of presiding over the vote, something he usually does to break ties. But Brown’s confirmation, 98-0, was not close. Pence called the moment “historic.”The vote came as the Trump administration and the mostly white Senate Republican conference grapple with the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. Protests have convulsed the nation alongside the coronavirus pandemic, with racial discrimination being the common thread between them. The vote in Washington overlapped with Floyd’s funeral in Houston.Brown most recently served as the commander of U.S. Pacific Air Forces. He is a fighter pilot, with more than 2,900 flying hours, including 130 in combat.He posted a video on social media Friday describing a lifetime of dealing with racial bias and the struggle to fit in to a predominantly white society.“I’m thinking about my Air Force career where I was often the only African American in my squadron or, as a senior officer, the only African American in the room,” he said in a raw tone. “I’m thinking about wearing the same flight suit with the same wings on my chest as my peers and being questioned by another military member: ‘Are you a pilot?’”Brown was commissioned in 1984 as a distinguished graduate of the ROTC program at Texas Tech University.He has served in a variety of positions at the squadron and wing levels, and commanded a fighter squadron and two fighter wings. He also was an F-16 instructor at the U.S. Air Force Weapons School.The military, with African Americans making up a little over 17% of its active-duty ranks, is more racially diverse than the country, which is 13% African American, according to 2019 Census estimates. The Army is the most diverse with more than 21% African Americans, while the Marine Corp is the least, with 10%. Blacks make up about 17% of the Navy and less than 15% of the Air Force.But there is a much greater racial divide within the active-duty military based on rank.Nineteen percent of active-duty enlisted troops are black, but they make up only 9% of the officer corps. Of those, there are just 71 who are general or flag officers, wearing one to four stars, including only two who have attained the top four-star rank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-confirms-gen-charles-brown-jr-as-first-black-us-military-service-chief-in-unanimous-vote/story-HxVqTlUr1mZuMw6fsSXk0J.html
10-06-2020||World||‘He is going to change the world’: Funeral held for George Floyd||George Floyd was fondly remembered Tuesday as “Big Floyd” — a father and brother, athlete and neighbourhood mentor, and now a catalyst for change — at a funeral for the black man whose death has sparked a global reckoning over police brutality and racial prejudice.More than 500 mourners wearing masks against the coronavirus packed a Houston church a little more than two weeks after Floyd was pinned to the pavement by a white Minneapolis police officer who put a knee on his neck for what prosecutors said was 8 minutes and 46 seconds.Cellphone video of the encounter, including Floyd’s pleas of “I can’t breathe,” ignited protests and scattered violence across the U.S. and around the world, turning the 46-year-old Floyd — a man who in life was little known beyond the public housing project where he was raised in Houston’s Third Ward — into a worldwide symbol of injustice.“Third Ward, Cuney Homes, that’s where he was born at,” Floyd’s brother, Rodney, told mourners at the Fountain of Praise church. “But everybody is going to remember him around the world. He is going to change the world.”The funeral capped six days of mourning for Floyd in three cities: Raeford, North Carolina, near where he was born; Houston, where he grew up; and Minneapolis, where he died. The memorials have drawn the families of other black victims whose names have become familiar in the debate over race and justice — among them, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin.After the service, Floyd’s golden casket was taken by hearse to the cemetery in the Houston suburb of Pearland where he was to be entombed next to his mother, for whom he cried out as he lay dying. A mile from the graveyard, the casket was transferred to a glass-sided carriage drawn by a pair of white horses. A brass band played as his casket was taken inside the mausoleum.Hundreds of people, some chanting, “Say his name, George Floyd,” gathered along the procession route and outside the cemetery entrance in the mid-90s heat.“I don’t want to see any black man, any man, but most definitely not a black man sitting on the ground in the hands of bad police,” said Marcus Brooks, 47, who set up a tent with other graduates of Jack Yates High School, Floyd’s alma mater.In the past two weeks, amid the furor over Floyd’s death, sweeping and previously unthinkable things have taken place: Confederate statues have been toppled, and many cities are debating overhauling, dismantling or cutting funding for police departments. Authorities in some places have barred police from using chokeholds or are otherwise rethinking policies on the use of force.Dozens of Floyd’s family members, most dressed in white, took part in the four-hour service. Grammy-winning singer Ne-Yo was among those who sang.The mourners included actors Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum, J.J. Watt of the NFL’s Houston Texans, rapper Trae tha Truth, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, who brought the crowd to its feet when he announced he will sign an executive order banning chokeholds in the city.“I know you have a lot of questions that no child should have to ask, questions that too many black children have had to ask for generations: Why? Why is Daddy gone?” former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, said, addressing Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter in a video eulogy played at the service. “Now is the time for racial justice. That’s the answer we must give to our children when they ask why.”Biden made no mention of his opponent in November. But other speakers took swipes at President Donald Trump, who has ignored demands to address racial bias and has called on authorities to crack down hard on lawlessness.“The president talks about bringing in the military, but he did not say one word about 8 minutes and 46 seconds of police murder of George Floyd,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist. “He challenged China on human rights. But what about the human right of George Floyd?”Most of the pews were full, with relatively little space between people.“So much for social distancing today,” the Rev. Remus Wright told mourners, gently but firmly instructing those attending to wear face masks.Texas has no limit on how many people can gather in places of worship during the pandemic, though Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has encouraged churches to follow federal health guidelines.Although the church service was private, at least 50 people gathered outside to pay their respects.“There’s a real big change going on, and everybody, especially black, right now should be a part of that,” said Kersey Biagase, who traveled more than three hours from Port Barre, Louisiana, with his girlfriend, Brandi Pickney. They wore T-shirts printed with Floyd’s name and “I Can’t Breathe.”Floyd served nearly five years in prison for robbery with a deadly weapon before becoming a mentor and a church outreach volunteer in Houston. He moved to Minnesota several years ago through a program that tried to change men’s lives by helping them find work in new settings.At the time of his death, Floyd was out of work as a bouncer at a Minneapolis club that had closed because of the coronavirus outbreak. He was seized by police after being accused of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store.Four Minneapolis officers were arrested in his death: Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with second-degree murder. J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting. All four could get up to 40 years in prison.Some of the mostly peaceful demonstrations that erupted after Floyd’s death were marked by bursts of arson, assaults, vandalism and smash-and-grab raids on businesses, with more than 10,000 people arrested. But protests in recent days have been overwhelmingly peaceful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-is-going-to-change-the-world-funeral-held-for-george-floyd/story-R464nysMhGiirFITbvoGZJ.html
10-06-2020||World||4.6 unemployed workers for each job opening in US amid Covid-19 pandemic||US employers laid off 7.7 million workers in April — a sign of just how deep the economic hole is after the closure of thousands of offices, restaurants, stores and schools during the pandemic.The Labor Department also said in a Tuesday report that job openings plummeted and hiring all but disappeared in April. The number of available jobs fell 16% from March, to 5 million. Hires declined 31% to 3.5 million.The grim April — which followed an even bleaker March with 11.5 million layoffs — suggests that the economy could take time to recover nearly a decade’s worth of gains that vanished in about 60 days. Hiring did rebound in May as 2.5 million jobs were added on net, the government said in a separate report Friday. But those gains appeared to reflect temporarily laid-off employees returning to work and increases in people with part-time jobs, rather than an economy at full throttle.The Tuesday report shows how employers responded quickly to the pandemic by furloughing or laying off workers in March, though that slowed the following month as consumer spending appeared to bottom out and even recover slightly. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, or JOLTS, details overall hiring and job separation figures, while the monthly jobs data reflects net changes.The next several months could be a challenge as monthly hiring was only at 60% of 2019’s average. There are 4.6 unemployed workers for each job opening, meaning it will likely take time for the economy to return to its pre-coronavirus health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-6-unemployed-workers-for-each-job-opening-in-us-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-Eg36W3iQDlbSOAcTEA4dWM.html
10-06-2020||World||Donald Trump’s 2020 path gets trickier with US formally in recession||President Donald Trump faces a new obstacle to his case for re-election -- the U.S. is now officially in recession.The “recession” label, made official on Monday, cements the pain that many voters are already feeling from the economy -- and will feed into their choice in November for who will be able to steer the economy back.For Democrat Joe Biden, the proclamation from the National Bureau of Economic Research is further evidence that the economy was on shaky ground even before the worst of the coronavirus hit. Trump, he said, has “squandered” the booming economy he inherited from President Barack Obama and himself.For Trump, the recession declaration came on the first weekday after the May jobs report showed 2.5 million jobs were created and the unemployment rate declined when it was expected to jump. On Friday he touted the numbers as a sign of “the greatest comeback in American history.”For now, the recession comes as polls show the president’s standing slipping across the board with the country reeling from the pandemic, its economic impact and racial justice protests. Trump is hoping to regain his footing by relaunching his signature rallies in the coming weeks where he will tout his economic record.And, while ignoring the recession announcement on his Twitter feed, Trump is maintaining his re-election argument that he built the strong economy once, and he can do it again.“TRANSITION TO GREATNESS!” he tweeted Tuesday, followed by, “THE REAWAKENING OF AMERICA!”Biden, for his part, argues that as vice president in 2009 he inherited the recession that began under Republican George W. Bush. He says he led the recovery efforts that began the economic expansion that ended in February and that he can do it again, this time as president.A CNN poll released Monday shows voters still give Trump the edge over Biden in managing the economy, 51% to 46%, even though Biden is leading the race by 14 points.The NBER, the official scorekeeper of when business cycles begin and end, said Monday that the recovery that began under Obama concluded its record 128-month run in February.But the committee also suggested that it may not last, noting that the pandemic has “resulted in a downturn with different characteristics and dynamics than prior recessions.” But there can be no mistake it’s a recession, the committee said, given the “unprecedented magnitude” and “broad reach” of the job losses.Trump spent most of his presidency taking credit for the booming economy, and now Biden is hanging the recession around his neck.“The president isn’t responsible for the virus,” Biden said in a statement. “But he is responsible for a completely bungled response that not only cost thousands of lives, but millions more jobs than should have been lost.“That’s on Donald Trump. It did not have to be this way,” he said.In fact, the timing of the announcement could actually help Trump.“Usually, the recession is over before they declare that it started,” said Princeton University economist Alan Blinder, a former Federal Reserve vice chairman appointed by President Bill Clinton. The more quickly the economy reaches the bottom, the more quickly it can begin to recover.The economy could be in recovery now, he said, meaning that it would likely be official by Election Day. But that doesn’t mean overall employment and economic output will be back to their pre-Covid levels.“If you fall down 17 flights of stairs and climb back up three, you’re in recovery,” Blinder said. “But you’re still 14 flights down from where you started.”Trump campaign spokesman Andrew Clark made clear that Trump will continue to run on the economy, recession notwithstanding.“Biden’s pathetic attempt to argue that the economy was in free fall before the coronavirus is a lie,” he said. “Before the global pandemic, the U.S. economy was delivering explosive wage growth for U.S. workers – including black workers and others who had been left behind when Biden was vice president – and job growth was smashing expectations.”Job growth and household incomes have the most direct effect on presidential approval ratings — not whether economists say there’s a recession. But recession dates are important to economic historians, who generally believe that Democratic presidents have been better for the economy than Republicans.That’s the conclusion of an analysis by Blinder and his Princeton colleague Mark Watson. Since Harry Truman’s election in 1948, Democratic presidents have spent an average of one quarter in recession for each term in office. Republicans have spent an average of 4.5 quarters in recession.Other economists and have noted that Congress and the Federal Reserve have as much control over the economy, and that decisions taken by one president can continue to affect the economy long after they’ve left office.All that might not matter much to voters, who tend to hold the president responsible for the economy.“There’s a lot of stuff that’s out of the control of the president that influences these things,” said Christopher Wlezien, a University of Texas professor who studies public opinion and the economy. “And voters don’t always discount that stuff.”(Added Alan Blinder comments beginning in 14th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-2020-path-gets-trickier-with-u-s-formally-in-recession/story-qVG5Stln8gShhfAluBFHqL.html
10-06-2020||World||WHO warns Covid-19 is worsening||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has been worsening globally and now is not the time for any country to “take its foot off the pedal”, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said, citing what he said was the highest number of new cases seen in a day by the health agency. More than 136,000 new cases were reported worldwide on Sunday, the most in a single day so far, and nearly 75% of them were reported from 10 countries, mostly in the Americas and South Asia, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online briefing on Monday.“Although the situation in Europe is improving, globally it is worsening. More than 100,000 cases have been reported on nine of the past 10 days. Yesterday, more than 136,000 cases were reported - the most in a single day so far,” said Tedros. “More than six months into the pandemic, this is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal”.Brazil, India, Russia, Chile, Pakistan, Peru and Mexico account for the highest number of cases after the US, which has continued to add the most number of new cases for close to a month. WHO’s tally of cases are based on numbers that are reported to it by member countries. According to data sources used by HT, which include worldometer.info and the Coronavirus Resource Centre by Johns Hopkins University, the highest number of new cases was recorded at a little over 130,000 on Friday.For the past two days, these set of countries added more than half of the daily new cases to the global tally. The larger Asian and South American regions contributed more than 76% of Monday’s new cases, becoming drivers of what may loosely be seen as a third spurt in the outbreak’s spread: the first was propelled by infections in China in late January. The second spike was driven by European countries such as Italy and Spain beginning in April.The outbreak in the US coincided with the second spike, and the country has continued to remain at the top of the list of nations with the most number of new cases. As of Monday, the US accounted for 2 million of the over 7 million total infections. Brazil, where the outbreak began accelerating in May, now has the third highest number of cases at close to 700,000 cases. Among countries with large populations, the UK has the highest ratio of deaths per million people - 597 - followed by Spain (580) and Italy (561). WHO chief Tedros said that in countries where the situation was improving, “the biggest threat is now complacency”, adding that “most people globally are still susceptible to infection”.Experts also said that removing lockdown measures in these countries, which largely comprise of low-to-middle income countries (LMIC), would be dangerous. “Politicians may be desperate to get their economies going again, but that could be at the expense of having huge numbers of people die,” news agency Associated Press quoted Dr Bharat Pankhania, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Exeter in Britain as saying.He also said reimposing recently lifted lockdown measures was equally dangerous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-covid-19-is-worsening/story-0Y7M4GAHjkUjmu2fuOcGNL.html

And we are going to make the world know that he made a difference,” Al Green, the local US congressman, told the congregation.“We have a responsibility to each one of them to make sure that we do not walk away today after having celebrated his life and not taking the next step... to assure the future generations that this won’t happen again,” he added.Floyd died on May 25 as a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck for almost nine minutes, his pleas of “I can’t breathe” becoming a rallying cry for protesters.His death has come to embody fractured relations between communities of color and police in the US and beyond as tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets.The Fountain of Praise was the final stage in a series of ceremonies paying tribute to Floyd before he is buried.In a day that capped more than two weeks of tension around the country, the theme inside the building was one of peace and hope as family members and friends took to the podium to share their grief, with civil rights leader the Reverend Al Sharpton due to deliver the eulogy.Flowers were piled high outside the entrance to the church, attended by part of his family, before a portrait of Floyd whose open casket was visited by more than 6,000 well-wishers on Monday.Some 500 guests -- all masked due the coronavirus pandemic -- filled the church, including actors Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx, as well as boxing champion Floyd Mayweather who is reportedly paying all expenses. ‘Justice in America’ Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who has visited the family, offered words of condolence to Floyd’s children in a video message urging them to “change the world for the better” in their father’s name.“Today now is the time, the purpose, the season to listen and heal,” said Biden, who suffered his own tragedy with the deaths of a wife and two children.“Now is time for racial justice... Because when there’s justice for George Floyd we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.”The funeral comes after the Minneapolis authorities pledged to dismantle and rebuild the police department in the city where Floyd died during an arrest for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill.Derek Chauvin, the 44-year-old white officer who was filmed pressing his knee on the handcuffed Floyd’s neck, faces up to 40 years if convicted on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.His bail was set on Monday at $1 million with conditions, or $1.25 million without.Three other policemen involved in Floyd’s arrest are charged with aiding and abetting his murder. All four officers have been fired.The arrest was caught on amateur video played in all corners of the world over the past two weeks.Tough line from Trump Floyd was born in North Carolina, but grew up in Houston’s predominantly African American Third Ward where he was remembered as a towering high school athlete and good-natured friend.Demonstrators have taken to the streets for two weeks of the most sweeping US protests for racial justice since the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.The demonstrations have been marred by several nights of violence that focused attention at home and abroad on police brutality as numerous videos have emerged that allegedly show incidents of heavy-handed policing. The Democrats have introduced legislation in both chambers of Congress, that they hope will make it easier to prosecute officers for abuse, and rethink how they are recruited and trained.Some US cities have already begun to embrace reforms -- starting with bans on the use of tear gas and rubber bullets. But it is unclear what support the reform bill might find in the Republican-controlled Senate -- or whether President Donald Trump would sign such legislation into law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-racial-justice-says-joe-biden-in-video-message-at-george-floyd-s-funeral/story-cQD9jS1vIrpDrIIXaOZpjO.html
