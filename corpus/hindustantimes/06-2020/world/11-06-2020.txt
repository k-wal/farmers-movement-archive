But “in combat, the men see just rocks” with combatants cowering behind them. “They don’t know who is behind the gun”. The source added: “This type of individual does not surrender”.- ‘Building intelligence’ -The army is not giving details of the exchanges that took place during the operation, merely confirming that fighting took place at close quarters. “We knew that there was a target of interest in the region for two days. After that, it was all a work of mutual support, between the different sources of intelligence,” said the source.“It is a case of building it up,” said the official, without revealing the origin of the information but confirming the help of the United States.Once the objective was identified and located, conditions in northern Mali at the beginning of the rainy season slowed down the progress of forces on the ground.In the operation, one individual was captured and handed to the Malian authorities after being interrogated by the French forces.But the soldiers also seized important digital material, including phones, cards and computers. Analysing them may help explain what Droukdel, who was usually very discreet, was doing in the region.- ‘Buried at the scene’ -There has for some time been major fighting between groups affiliated with Al-Qaeda with those of Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (IS-GS). These have been “violent” fights with “losses on both sides”, according to the French source.It is has not been ruled out that this could have prompted Droukdel’s presence in the area.“It’s a real question,” said the source, expressing hope that analysis would shed more light on this. The IS-GS was designated in January as the number one enemy of France’s 5,000 strong anti-jihadist force Barkhane and its G5 Sahel allies of Mauritania, Chad, Mali, Niger, Burkina Faso. But, in the end, it was an Al-Qaeda figure who was killed in this operation. “The fact that today we have focused a certain number of our forces on the most virulent and urgent threat has not distracted us from the surveillance of other branches”, said the source.Once the operation was finished, the special forces “applied the standards of armed conflict: the enemy combatants were buried at the scene”.Meanwhile the prisoner taken “will answer for his actions before the courts”, said the source.The official praised the operational efficiency of the French forces on the ground and in the air, saying they were capable of deploying in a clandestine situation in full gear in temperatures of 45 degrees Celsius (113 degrees Fahrenheit).In military terms, these are “extremely rustic conditions”, said the source.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capture-not-possible-france-s-desert-operation-against-al-qaeda-chief/story-vzpJ6fu8hprp43qAvfwZKI.html

Fighters affiliated with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group have staged a growing number of attacks and gained more territory in the past year in Burkina Faso, displacing more than 750,000 people in that country’s north.There have been growing concerns over the possible presence of Islamic militants in Ivory Coast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-kill-10-ivory-coast-soldiers-near-burkina-faso-border/story-Dz4VnvMWF7ypu8fWPHBnyH.html

I think we’ve learned that if you shut down the economy, you’re going to create more damage,” Mnuchin said in an interview on CNBC.His comments were echoed by President Donald Trump, who tweeted “We will have a very good Third Quarter, a great Fourth Quarter, and one of our best ever years in 2021. We will also soon have a Vaccine & Therapeutics/Cure. That’s my opinion. WATCH!”The president’s tweet came after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday predicted an economic contraction of 6.5 percent this year, while warning the outlook remained uncertain.“The Federal Reserve is wrong so often,” Trump said. “I see the numbers also, and do MUCH better than they do.”Orders to close businesses to stop the virus’s spread beginning in mid-March have badly harmed the world’s largest economy, leading to tens of millions of layoffs and an unemployment rate of 13.3 percent in May, a figure reminiscent of the Great Depression 90 years ago.Yet the virus remains deadly across the United States, with more than 112,900 deaths reported as of Wednesday and two million cases, while some states like Texas and North Carolina are seeing more hospitalizations from Covid-19 than they did a month ago.Wall Street stocks reversed days of gains on Thursday, with major indices plunging into the red after the Labor Department reported another 1.5 million people filed new claims for unemployment benefits last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-economy-will-stay-open-even-in-second-coronavirus-wave-steven-mnuchin/story-H0VAIjQQAPr23oJH6tjwTN.html
11-06-2020||World||Top US general Mark Milley regrets park walk with US President Donald Trump||General Mark Milley, America’s top military officer, on Thursday expressed regret for accompanying President Donald Trump on his controversial walk through a park outside the White House violently cleared of peaceful protestors on June 1 by law enforcement forces.“I should not have been there,” Milley, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, said in a pre-recorded video commencement address to National Defense University. “As a commissioned uniformed officer, it was a mistake that I have learned from, and I sincerely hope we all can learn from it.”Defense Secretary Mark Esper had earlier sought to distance himself from the controversial walk that some are saying will be a watershed moment for the Trump presidency.President Trump had strode out of the White House accompanied by a large entourage of officials and walked through a park swept clean of protestors with the heavy use of pepper spray canisters, tear gas shells and flash-bang grenades, to pose for pictures in front of a church damaged in protests earlier. He had just held up a copy of the Bible, but said nothing.Esper, Milley and Attorney General Willam Barr were in the president’s entourage. Milley’s’ presence in military fatigues, which he wears every day to work, had attracted a lot of criticism as it was taken to indicate the US military was taking sides in a political event, contrary to its standing as an apolitical, non-partisan institution.“That sparked a national debate about the role of the military in civil society,” Milley said. “My presence in that moment and in that environment created a perception of the military involved in domestic politics.”“We who wear the cloth of our nation come from the people of our nation, and we must hold dear the principle of an apolitical military that is so deeply rooted in the very essence of our republic,” he added.US military leaders have differed with the president also on the issue of renaming army bases names after general of the confederate army, in the wake of countrywide protests triggered by the death of George Floyd and the fierce debate that is under way to deal with persisting racism in the country. Esper and Milley were “open” open to discussions about renaming these bases. But the president shut it down in a string of tweets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-general-regrets-park-walk-with-trump/story-j3g03ZMzvTpGxXZzdWzU8J.html

According to him, this would undermine the ‘One country, two systems’ framework agreed at the time of the former colony’s 1997 handover.Raab wrote in a foreword in the Foreign Office’s latest six-monthly report on Hong Kong to parliament: “As I announced to parliament on June 2, if China enacts this legislation we will amend the arrangements for those with British National Overseas status in Hong Kong”.“If China follows through with its proposed legislation, we will put in place new arrangements to allow BN(O)s to come to the UK without the current 6 month limit, enabling them to live and apply to study and work for extendable periods of 12 months, providing a path to British citizenship”, he added.Beijing has rejected London’s criticism as interference in China’s internal affairs. Prime Minister Johnson has also confirmed London’s intention to offer BNOs a path to British citizenship if Beijing implemented the security law in Hong Kong.According to Raab, public trust in the Hong Kong police is allegedly at an all-time low. The UK, he wrote, will not look the other way when it comes to the people of Hong Kong, will stand by them and will live up to its responsibilities.“For the Chinese Government, rather than Hong Kong’s own institutions, to directly impose national security legislation would lie in direct conflict with Article 23 of Hong Kong’s Basic Law, and with China’s obligations under the Sino-British Joint Declaration”, Raab wrote.“At the time of writing, we have not seen the text of the legislation. However the law, as it has been described, raises the prospect of prosecution in Hong Kong for political crimes, which would undermine existing commitments to protect the rights and freedoms of the people of Hong Kong”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/still-time-for-china-to-reconsider-hong-kong-security-law-uk/story-r6zs7SKvns8UlvL59fZRPK.html

A policeman chased him, but he tried to defend himself with the knife so they used their guns and killed him.” Although he did not go into detail about the attacker’s motives, Lucansky said the young man appeared to have “struggled with mental health problems”.All the injured were conscious and in a stable condition en route to a hospital in the nearby city of Martin, an emergency services spokesperson said.Health Minister Marek Krajci said the teacher and children had “severe stab wounds”.Prime Minister Igor Matovic conveyed his “sincere condolences” to the victim’s family.The interior minister was flying to the scene, Matovic told journalists on the sidelines of a meeting of central European leaders in the neighbouring Czech Republic.President Zuzana Caputova offered her condolences and support for “all the teachers, police officers, children and their parents affected by this difficult and fearful time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/teacher-killed-in-stabbing-attack-at-slovakia-school/story-7bQ6J3vpJ1BwX91UdLD5CJ.html
11-06-2020||World||US Covid-19 cases over 2 million, expert warns of 100,000 more deaths||The United States now has more than 2 million Covid-19 infections with over 27,000 reported in the last 24 hours and a spike in hospitalisation has been reported from 12 states triggering fears of a second wave and, in a grim reminder that it is far from over yet, an expert has forecast 100,000 more fatalities by September. More than 112,000 fatalities had been reported till Thursday morning, with 935 in the last 24 hours. Ashish Jha, a Harvard physician, has argued the United States could see around 25,000 deaths a months, with the average of around 800 a day, at the minimum, going up to 200,000 by mid-September.“Even if we don’t have increasing cases, even if we keep things flat, it’s reasonable to expect that we’re going to hit 200,000 deaths sometime during the month of September,” Jha said. in an interview to CNN Wednesday. “And that’s just through September. The pandemic won’t be over in September.”Ramped up testing, contact tracing, strict adherence to social distancing norms and widespread use of masks could help prevent spiraling fatalities, he has argued.Anthony Fauci, the top US epidemiologist who has also said the epidemic is not done with the United States yet, told ABC Wednesday he is worried about the impact of ongoing protests and demonstrations. “Masks can help, but it’s masks plus physical separation and when you get congregations like we saw with the demonstrations, like we have said — myself and other health officials — that’s taking a risk,” he said., adding, “Unfortunately, what we’re seeing now is just an example of the kinds of things we were concerned about.”Covid-19 hospitalizations — a number far more worrying than infections — have been spiking in 12 states (21 states have seen a surge in new infections) and there is talk already of a second wave hitting states after they reopened. Such as Florida, Arizona, and Texas.Texas recorded a single-day high of more than 2,500 new cases and Florida logged a seven-day total of 8,553 cases, according to Bloomberg, which was told by Eric Tanner, a Johns Hopkins University scholar, “There is a new wave coming in parts of the country. t’s small and it’s distant so far, but it’s coming.”Public health officials have been most worried about Arizona, where the number of new cases has doubled — up by 211% — over the past two weeks, the states health department has said. Its healthcare system, which is up to 83% occupancy, is in danger of being overwhelmed soon.But the epidemic appears to have slipped off the radar of the president, the White House and US congress partly because of President Trump’s hurry to reopen the country, put businesses back at work and turnaround rising unemployment numbers (another 1.2 million filed for unemployment benefits last week) , which was has happened to an extent with hirings taking off. The other reason has been antiracism protests and unrest ripping through the country after the death of George Floyd, an African American man, under a knee of a white police officer, with three others holding him down.President Trump has announced plans to return to the campaign trail with public rallies; some of them in states that are experiencing a spike in new infections: Florida, Texas, Arizona, and North Carolina. He starts on June 19 in Oklahoma, which is relatively safer, but Tulsa, where the rally is to take place, is in a county that has seen a modest rise.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-over-2-million-expert-warns-of-100-000-more-deaths/story-VMiI0h1zXGc0j6NYMahhzJ.html

I’m very glad to have been able to join you today.”The video was released on Thursday to mark Carers Week and highlight the sacrifices made by the approximately 7 million unpaid carers in the United Kingdom, many of whom have had to take on extra roles during the lockdown brought about by the novel coronavirus pandemic.Last month, Buckingham Palace released audio of a telephone call the queen made to thank nurses for their work during the pandemic, another first for the British monarch during her 68-year reign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-queen-elizabeth-joins-first-public-video-conference-call-to-mark-carers-week/story-zTsvugXnB8LKqBbcH8uZvI.html

Based on evidence, some more drugs to be used in combination with hydroxychloroquine may be added to the protocol, but no consensus has been reached regarding them as yet, the source said.The new clinical management guidelines for Covid-19 is in the process of being finalised by the experts of the National Task Force on Covid-19, which last held its meeting on Sunday.India’s drug regulator had last week granted US pharma giant Gilead Sciences the marketing authorisation for its drug remdesivir for “restricted emergency use” on hospitalised Covid-19 in the country, sources said.The approval process for remdesivir was accelerated in view of the emergency situation and the unmet need for medicines in light of the coronavirus outbreak.“This medicine, which is administered in the form of an injection, has been approved to be sold by retail on the prescription of specialists for use in a hospital or in institutional set-up only. It has been approved for use for a maximum of five days,” a source said.India currently does not manufacture remdesivir. The four companies -- Hetero, Jubilant Life Sciences, Cipla and Mylan NV -- with which Gilead Sciences Inc have entered into non-exclusive licensing agreements are still awaiting permission from the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) for manufacturing and distribution remdesivir in the country. Remdesivir has been issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of hospitalized patients with severe Covid-19 illness.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/remdesivir-being-considered-for-restricted-use-on-severely-ill-covid-19-patients-report/story-5ueUVfCa39wWc9uPyuXkZI.html

The river defines the border between the two countries.Oli’s claim comes in midst of a raging boundary row between the two countries with India sternly asking Nepal not to resort to any “artificial enlargement” of territorial claims after Kathmandu released a new political map laying claim over Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura.The ties between India and Nepal came under strain after Defence Minister Rajnath Singh inaugurated a 80-km-long strategically crucial road connecting the Lipulekh pass with Dharchula in Uttarakhand on May 8.Nepal reacted sharply to the inauguration of the road claiming that it passed through Nepalese territory. India rejected the claim asserting that the road lies completely within its territory.Nepalese officials say that Nepal had control over the area before 1962, when the India-China war took place. At that time India stationed its army seeking permission from then Nepalese rulers for temporary purpose, but it never removed its forces, they claim.Although there are border issues in other areas such as Susta but the government has given priority to Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as Nepali territories have not been captured by deploying army in other parts of its international border, Oli said in response to a question in Parliament.Earlier this week, the Nepalese Parliament unanimously endorsed a proposal to consider a constitution amendment bill to pave way for putting the new political map that includes Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s national emblem.A discussion on the issue started in the Parliament since Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Shivamaya Tumbahanfe tabled a bill for the second amendment to the Nepalese Constitution to incorporate the new political map of Nepal on May 31.Prime Minister Oli said he was happy to learn that the unprecedented unity has been shown both within and outside the Parliament on the issue of national unity and territorial integrity.“Our ancestors founded and saved this country through their struggles. We will be able to establish our territorial integrity if we remain firm,” he said.Prime Minister Oli also raised objection to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s reported remark that Nepal should not repeat the mistake which Tibet made.“If Adityanath spoke about that, it was not appropriate,” he said.“It is not appropriate to threaten Nepal in that way... This should not have been spoken by a chief minister of UP,” he said. “It is a deplorable matter, if he spoke so.” Oli also complained about India’s unwillingness to receive the joint report prepared by Eminent Persons’ Group (EPG) of India and Nepal.Nepal is ready to receive the report, but it would be meaningless unless both the governments receive it, he said. “As per the condition, India should first receive the report but it has not shown any interest to receive the report which was prepared two years ago,” he claimed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-will-get-back-land-from-india-through-dialogue-pm-oli/story-vjT4RRClqeWU7KANlYqaOI.html
11-06-2020||World||Black Lives Matter protests: Gandhi statues in UK among targets of ire||Mahatma Gandhi’s alleged views about Africans during his time in South Africa have been dredged to target his statues in the UK as protestors demand that statues of historical figures linked to racism and slavery trade be removed from public spaces.Gandhi’s statue in Parliament Square was targeted during the Black Lives matter (BLM) demonstration on Sunday, when the word ‘racist’ was written near its plinth. On the same day, the statue of 17th century slave trader Edward Colston was pulled down in Bristol.Now thousands of people have signed an online petition to the Leicester City Council for the removal of Gandhi’s statue in the east Midlands city with a large population of Indian origin. It was installed on the arterial Belgrave Road in 2009.Indian circles believe that the BLM campaign is being exploited by anti-India elements based in the UK, where six Gandhi statues have been installed in five cities in recent decades, including two in London: Tavistock Square (1968) and Parliament Square (2015). There were mixed views when the statue in Parliament Square was installed.BLM campaigners have drawn up a ‘hit-list’ of at least 78 statues and memorials across the UK that they believe should be removed, including those of Henry Dundas, who was president of the Board of Control of the East India Company from 1793 to 1801 (in Edinburgh), and of Robert Clive, first governor of the colonial Bengal Presidency (in Shropshire).The BLM campaign has also revived the demand to remove the statue of imperialist Cecil Rhodes from the Oriel College in the University of Oxford, where intense debate continues over its fate amidst growing support for its removal.In London, mayor Sadiq Khan has ordered a review of statues and public spaces for statues and items related to slave trade. Soon after his announcement, the statue of noted slaveholder Robert Milligan was removed from outside the Museum of London Docklands.Many Labour-controlled councils have initiated such reviews, including the Ealing Council in west London, where a consultation is being launched to rename Southall’s Havelock Road – named after Henry Havelock, general in the colonial army involved in suppressing the 1857 Uprising – as Guru Nanak Road.Khan, said: “Our capital’s diversity is our greatest strength, yet our statues, road names and public spaces reflect a bygone era. It is an uncomfortable truth that our nation and city owes a large part of its wealth to its role in the slave trade and while this is reflected in our public realm, the contribution of many of our communities to life in our capital has been wilfully ignored”.“This cannot continue. We must ensure that we celebrate the achievements and diversity of all in our city, and that we commemorate those who have made London what it is – that includes questioning which legacies are being celebrated”.“The Black Lives Matter protests have rightly brought this to the public’s attention, but it’s important that we take the right steps to work together to bring change and ensure that we can all be proud of our public landscape,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-protests-gandhi-statues-in-uk-among-targets-of-ire/story-LTGXElGMpSIRHU4cseRtHN.html
11-06-2020||World||Britain publishes Covid-19 safety guidance for airlines and airports||Britain published new guidance for airlines and airports on how to operate safely to minimise the risks from coronavirus, adding to hopes that the country will soon agree deals to allow quarantine-free travel. Passengers and staff should wear face coverings in airports and on aircraft, while passengers should check in all luggage including hand bags and remain seated for as much of the flight as possible, said the Department for Transport on Thursday.Since the outbreak of coronavirus, there has been minimal flying into and out of Britain. Airlines had been hoping for a recovery in July, but they say new UK rules requiring international arrivals to quarantine for 14-days have pushed this back.Britain has said work is continuing on “air bridges” between countries with low infection rates, something which the industry says is vital to kickstart travel demand and avoid further job losses on top of the tens of thousands already announced. The new aviation guidance shows the government is preparing for a restart. “We are taking the necessary steps to ensure a framework is in place for the aviation industry to bounce back when it is safe for restrictions on travel to be lifted,” said transport minister Grant Shapps in a statement. Many airlines including easyJet, Ryanair and British Airways have already said that customers must wear face coverings onboard. The guidance to put most baggage in the hold could be problematic for some low-cost airlines such as Ryanair which formerly charged a premium for customers to keep larger bags with them in the cabin.The government also said in its guidance that there should be extensive cleaning of the aircraft, and more availability of handwashing and hand sanitiser facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-publishes-covid-19-safety-guidance-for-airlines-and-airports/story-MYESRpt7UH2Rxd8cSiOYOJ.html

He fell into River Forth while celebrating a birthday, reports said.Chief inspector Gill Marshall, Stirling srea commander, said: “I can confirm that a body has sadly been recovered from the River Forth at Stirling today (Thursday). Formal identification has yet to take place, but the family of missing 21-year-old Prajwal Pandharinath Guhagarkar has been informed”.“Prajwal was reported to have fallen into the River Forth near Bridgehaugh Road, Stirling, in the early hours of Saturday, 6 June, in what appears to have been a tragic accident and we have been utilising extensive resources as part of our search since then”.“Our inquiries are ongoing to establish the full circumstances surrounding the death and we continue to offer support to Prajwal’s family. As is the case with all sudden deaths, a report will be submitted to the Procurator Fiscal,” she added.The search for Guhagarkar included air units, police, fire, ambulance and coastguard crew, and the use of the remotely piloted aircraft near Alloa, 12 km downstream from Stirling along the River Forth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/missing-indian-student-s-body-found-in-scotland/story-l0EftUenQht3hUbrM6ckeO.html

The sample nucleic acid test was positive, and the expert diagnosed as new coronary pneumonia confirmed cases,” the official was quoted in state media.Beijing lowered its emergency response to the novel coronavirus epidemic from the second level to the third on Saturday, a local official had announced Friday.Beijing, local government spokesperson, Xu Hejian said had not reported any locally transmitted or imported case of Covid-19 for 50 consecutive days, signalling that prevention measures had worked.Overall, Beijing had reported 420 local and 174 imported cases of Covid-19, Xu said, adding that the death toll stood at nine.Oveall, the Chinese mainland reported 11 new imported Covid-19 cases for June 10, bringing the total number of imported cases to 1,797, the national health commission (NHC) said Thursday.Of the 11 imported cases, six were reported in Shanghai, three in Guangdong Province, one each in Tianjin and in Fujian province, the commission said.Of all the imported cases on the mainland, 1,736 had been discharged from hospitals after recovery, and 61 remained hospitalized.No deaths had been reported from the imported cases, official news agency, Xinhua reported Thursday.China has reported over 83000 cases and 4634 deaths from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-reports-1-new-locally-transmitted-covid-19-case-after-nearly-2-months/story-5q84tauVRch99Cqlmy8NvN.html
11-06-2020||World||Joint inflammation drug may be repurposed to treat Covid-19: Study||A drug used to treat joint inflammation can be repurposed to treat patients with Covid-19, according to a study which may lead to a new treatment option for the deadly disease. Researchers, including those from Imperial College London in the UK, noted that baricitinib is an oral drug used for treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis -- a chronic inflammatory disorder which affects the joints, causing pain and stiffness. According to the study, published in the journal EMBO Molecular Medicine, the drug may lower inflammation and the quantity of the virus particles present in patients with COVID-19. Using AI-algorithms, the scientists identified existing drugs capable of blocking both inflammation and infectivity, and they found baricitinib to be a promising repurposing candidate for COVID-19. They said the drug acts as an inhibitor of janus kinase, a type of molecule in the body that acts as an “on” or “off” switch in many cellular functions. Baricitinib interferes with the inflammatory processes of the immune system and may be a potential treatment candidate for COVID-19, the study noted. The drug also previously demonstrated ability to inhibit the activity of cell-cell messenger molecules called cytokines, the researchers said. In test tube studies, and in miniature liver models, the scientists showed that the drug inhibited signalling of cytokines, which are known to overreact and drive inflammation in severe COVID-19 cases. According to the study, baricitinib also helped reduce the quantity of the novel coronavirus in infected cells, and the level of the signal molecule interleukin-6 (IL-6) -- a predictor of mortality from acute respiratory distress syndrome associated with COVID-19. When a small pilot study of the drug in three men and one woman with COVID-19 was conducted in Italy, all four patients showed improvements in signs and symptoms such as cough, fever, with reductions in quantity of the virus particles, and blood IL-6 levels after 10-12 days of treatment, the study noted. “Collectively, these data suggest that baricitinib may lower inflammation and viral load in COVID-19,” said Ali Mirazimi, a co-author of the study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden. The scientists said more trials of baricitinib are currently underway in 85 hospitalised COVID-19 patients across three hospitals in Northern and Central Italy, with “encouraging initial results in patient outcomes.” “We are integrating and carefully analysing these trial data and providing functional and mechanistic follow-up studies to scrutinise baricitinib’s mode of action,” said Volker Lauschke, another co-author of the study from Karolinska Institutet.

11-06-2020||World||Nepal government to ease coronavirus lockdown in some areas||The Nepal government has decided to ease the ongoing nationwide coronavirus lockdown in some low-risk areas, including the Kathmandu valley. The government had enforced the lockdown on March 24 to contain the spread of the deadly virus. On May 30, it extended the lockdown for the seventh time till June 14.Nepal has recorded over 4,360 cases and 15 deaths due to the disease.A Cabinet meeting held on Wednesday decided to change the modality of the lockdown in an attempt to gradually resume economic activities, sources said. The meeting has decided to allow operation of businesses, industries and private vehicles in Kathmandu Valley and other districts that have recorded fewer cases of COVID-19.However, the decision is yet to be officially announced and is expected to come into effect from Friday onwards.According to the sources, private vehicles will be allowed to operate on an odd-even basis in a bid to avoid traffic congestion. Private four-wheelers will be allowed to carry only two passengers, including the driver, while two-wheelers will not be allowed to carry pillion riders. The Cabinet laid an emphasis on adopting precautionary measures, including social distance in order to check further spread of the the coronavirus. The movement of people to Kathmandu from other districts will be halted until the situation in the country improves further. The Cabinet meeting has decided not to allow long-route passenger bus services. Schools, colleges, cinema halls and other places of public gathering will continue to remain closed. The restrictions on international and domestic flights will also continue. Meanwhile, hundreds of youths on Thursday staged a demonstration in front of the prime minister’s official residence in Baluwatar, demanding easing of the lockdown, making purchase of coronavirus-related medicine transparent, expanding COVID-19 tests and implementing effective measures to control the spread of the disease.The protesters were chanting anti-government slogans and carrying placards that read “Disease or hunger?”, “We don’t need MCC; don’t sell the country”, “No transparency, no farsightedness, why is there always incompetency?” and “Sanitise the government.” In another development, 150 Nepalese female labourers, who were stranded in Kuwait, were repatriated to Kathmandu on Thursday on a chartered flight.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-government-to-ease-coronavirus-lockdown-in-some-areas/story-dnz5M6wKFSEMQ1b1oRsibK.html
11-06-2020||World||Russia rolls out first approved Covid-19 drug as infections pass 500,000||Russia on Thursday rolled out a drug approved to treat patients suffering from the novel coronavirus, its state financial backer said, as the number of infections there surpassed half a million.The first deliveries of the new antiviral drug, registered under the name Avifavir, were made to some hospitals and clinics across the country, Russia’s RDIF sovereign wealth fund said in a press release. RDIF has funded trials and has a 50% share in the drug’s manufacturer ChemRar.The health ministry gave its approval for the drug’s use under a special accelerated process while clinical trials, held over a shorter period and with fewer people than many other countries, were still underway. There is currently no vaccine for Covid-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, and human trials of several existing antiviral drugs have yet to show efficacy.RDIF chief Kirill Dmitriev last week told Reuters the plan was for ChemRar to manufacture enough of the drug to treat around 60,000 people a month. Dmitriev on Thursday said more than 10 countries had made requests for Avifavir supplies. Negotiations were underway to supply the drug to almost all of Russia’s regions, with seven of its more than 80 regions receiving Thursday’s initial deliveries, Dmitriev added. With 502,436 cases, Russia has the third highest number of infections in the world after Brazil and the United States, but has a relatively low official death toll of 6,532 - something that has been the focus of debate.The Moscow health department on Wednesday raised its death toll for the month of May, citing changes in the way it determines the cause of death for patients suffering from other health problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-rolls-out-first-approved-covid-19-drug-as-infections-pass-500-000/story-fgVuxKeI7Bgu5MdnUWziYJ.html
11-06-2020||World||South Korea hit by human rights watch over leaflet crackdown||A top official at a global human rights organization criticized South Korea for trying to shut down two activist groups who sent anti-Kim Jong Un leaflets by balloon across the border into North Korea.Phil Robertson, deputy Asia director for Human Rights Watch, said a decision by South Korea to revoke the licenses and seek prosecution for the groups is a blow against the campaign to hold North Korea accountable for its human rights violations for the sake of political expediency.The moves against the activists are “a blatant violation of freedom of association that cannot be justified with vague appeals to border security and relations with the North,” he said in a statement Thursday.His comments came the day after South Korea’s Unification Ministry said the government plans to cancel the licenses of two groups -- Fighters for Free North Korea and KeunSaem -- that sent balloons with leaflets across the border, and ask prosecutors whether they can bring charges on suspicion of violating an inter-Korean exchange law. Officials from the groups have not responded to requests to comment.‘Wicked Act’While millions of leaflets have been flown across the border for more than a decade, Pyongyang in recent days slammed South Korean President Moon Jae-in for letting groups that include North Korean defectors send the leaflets into its territory.On Tuesday, it cut off communications links set up with its neighbor about two years ago, in an expression of its anger. Kim Yo Jong, the younger sister of North Korea’s leader, previously accused South Korea of tolerating a “sordid and wicked act of hostility.”North Korea Cuts Off Communications With Seoul Over LeafletsMoon’s office expressed “deep regrets” over activists groups that send leaflets condemning Kim Jong Un toward North Korean territory and will actively seek legal procedures to punish them, Kim You-geun, a senior official at the National Security Council, said at a Thursday briefing.South Korea’s Unification Ministry in a text message Thursday said its official position hasn’t changed from the previous day, when it announced it would seek legal action against the two groups.“Rather than kowtow to threats from Kim Jong Un’s sister, South Korea should call for Pyongyang to open uncensored and unrestricted channels for communication between people across the 38th parallel,” Robertson said.Moon, a former human rights lawyer, has made a fresh push to restore economic and other exchanges with North Korea after his ruling progressive camp scored a supermajority in parliamentary elections in April.But Moon doesn’t have much he can offer North Korea without prompting a blowup from the Trump administration, which has repeatedly rejected Seoul’s calls for sanctions relief. The US has refused to relax United Nations penalties and other measures against the regime without greater commitments on arms reduction from Kim Jong Un.The United Nations special rapporteur for North Korea has said the country systematically abuses the rights of its citizens and denies them basic freedoms, while the US State Department accuses Pyongyang of a brutal campaign to crush dissent through political prisons, torture and executions.South Korean activist groups have accused Moon of downplaying abuses north of the border so as not to upset relations with Kim Jong Un.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-hit-by-human-rights-watch-over-leaflet-crackdown/story-N6nk3hZwnEWTV1gF8x8VuJ.html

A PML-N party leader Ataullah Tarar said that Sharif’s “life had been endangered in this situation by NAB’s summoning of him”.“NAB was informed multiple times in writing that Shehbaz Sharif has suffered from cancer and compared to other people, his immunity system is weak,” Tarar was quoted as saying.“Imran Niazi and NAB will be responsible if something happens to Shehbaz Sharif,” he added.When asked about the news, Hamza Shehbaz, Sharif’s son and PML-N leader, said: “This is a difficult time for Pakistan. May Allah grant health to everyone’s parents.”The PML-N president had appeared before the National Accountability Bureau on Tuesday in connection with investigations pertaining to money laundering and income-beyond-means.Earlier this month, he had also appeared before the Lahore High Court to obtain a pre-arrest bail in cases regarding money laundering and assets beyond means. Sharif had filed the appeal in the high court a day before a NAB team raided his residence to arrest him on June 2, after he refused to appear before the accountability watchdog.Sharif had thrice refused to appear before NAB citing health reasons. In a statement submitted to the bureau, he said: “It has been widely reported in the media that some NAB officials have tested positive for Covid-19.“Please appreciate [that] I am a cancer survivor and 69 years old. I have been advised limited exposure on account of the peculiar background of low immunity,” he said.He added that he was available to answer any queries by the investigation team via Skype.Sharif is the latest PML-N leader to have tested positive for the virus. Multiple other members of PML-N’s top-tier leadership have been diagnosed with the disease, including Aurangzeb, Tariq Fazal Chaudhry, Ahsan Iqbal and former prime minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-pakistan-pm-nawaz-sharif-s-brother-tests-positive-for-covid-19/story-9iJD47CmLXy95jBjYvKgBM.html
11-06-2020||World||China second pollution survey shows progress in battling emissions||China’s second national survey of pollution showed major air and water pollutants dropped significantly in the ten years since 2007, though the region surrounding Beijing still remains one of the most polluted in terms of air quality.The census, which China began in 2017 and concluded in 2019, is based on information collected from more than 3.5 million sources of pollution. It showed that the amount of three major pollutants -- sulfur dioxides, chemical oxygen demand and nitrous oxides -- dropped by 72%, 46% and 34% respectively from ten years earlier, when the first census was done.The findings showed major polluting industries also did less damage to the environment. The paper-making industry produced 84% less chemical oxygen demand than in 2007, sulfur dioxide from the steel industry dropped by 54% and nitrogen oxides from the cement producing industry dropped by 23%.China’s leaders are grappling with how to maintain the nation’s momentum in battling pollution as attention turns to reviving an economy battered by the coronavirus. China was either on track to meet or had already met most of its 2020 climate goals before the pandemic, but is struggling to curb coal power and has already delayed tightening emission controls on vehicles to help automakers.Coronavirus Deaths Stir Calls in China to Clean Up Air PollutionEmissions from agriculture, industry, households and motor vehicles have become harder to control compared with ten years ago, deputy environmental minister Zhao Yingmin told reporters at a briefing where the census was released. China’s countryside and its western region still lag behind in terms of the number of environmental protection facilities and more money will be invested there, he said.The census showed that emissions of four major pollutants -- chemical oxygen demand, nitrous oxides, particulate matter and volatile organics emissions -- were all above 10 million tons in 2017. Almost half of industrial pollutants were produced by the fabricated metal industry, manufacturing of non-metallic mineral products, manufacturing of general machinery, rubber and plastic products and the textile industry, the report showed.The census pointed to three regions -- the area surrounding Beijing, the Yangtze River Delta and the Fenhe-Weihe River Plains near Xian -- as having the highest intensity of air pollutants.Zhao also said the number of domestic waste disposal facilities in China had increased by 86% from 2007 to 2017.China generates hundreds of millions tonnes of urban household refuse daily. Since most Chinese families do not sort garbage, 97% of the rubbish is either buried or incinerated. The country plans to roll out a mandatory waste sorting system across 46 major cities by the end of this year, modelled on one launched in Shanghai in 2019 with surveillance cameras and volunteers checking for compliance at dumping sites.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-second-pollution-survey-shows-progress-in-battling-emissions/story-zlrO2xoLNuPQbl0gi6MOFO.html

But with planes grounded and no revenue, it says the job losses are necessary because travel demand is set to shrink in coming years.The BA collection includes works by Damien Hirst, Peter Doig and Bridget Riley, and selling off some of the works, which usually hang in executive lounges at airports, was an idea from a BA staff member, a source familiar with the situation said on Thursday.At least one work has been valued at more than 1 million pounds ($1.27 million), the source added.BA boss Alex Cruz said last week that with its parent company IAG burning through 178 million pounds ($223 million) a week, he could not guarantee BA’s survival and urged unions to engage over the job cuts.The airline has said it is taking steps now to reduce up to 28% of staff numbers to protect as many jobs as it can in the long term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-airways-to-put-artworks-on-sale-in-covid-19-cash-crunch/story-HkhI1q654BRsupNaN2mCWI.html
11-06-2020||World||Prince Philip marks quiet 99th birthday in lockdown||Britain’s Prince Philip marked a quiet 99th birthday in lockdown with his wife, Queen Elizabeth II, at Windsor Castle in south-east England.Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the 94-year-old monarch, who have been married for 72 years, have been isolating together since March when the UK went into lockdown in the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic in the country.Buckingham Palace released a new photograph of the royal couple, which was taken on June 1 in the quadrangle at the castle, to mark the birthday on Wednesday. No visits were planned due to the lockdown restrictions for the elderly but the royal family has been connecting with each other through Zoom and other online mediums and are likely to have done so for the birthday as well.Various divisions of the UK’s Armed Forces took to social media to wish the prince, who has an active history with the forces, a happy birthday.The Royal Marines official Twitter page read: “Happy 99th Birthday to the #DukeofEdinburgh #PrincePhilip from the Royal Marines.“In honour of this day, we wanted to share some images from the Duke of Edinburgh’s time as the Captain General of the Royal Marines.” It included photos of the Duke of Edinburgh involved in several military ceremonies in the past.The Intelligence Corps projected a birthday message for the prince onto one of their officers’ buildings and said: “His Royal Highness has been Colonel-in-Chief of the Intelligence Corps since 1977. We wish him many happy returns and send him this birthday message projected onto the Priory Officers’ Mess at Chicksands.” Prince Philip has not been seen in public since he spent four nights in hospital in December last year for what royal officials said was a planned “precautionary measure” for a pre-existing condition.Born in Corfu, Greece, in 1921, the royal is the longest-serving monarch’s consort in British history. He retired and stepped down from frontline royal duties in May 2017.The Queen also celebrated her 94th birthday in April quietly, cancelling the traditional gun salute because of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-marks-quiet-99th-birthday-in-lockdown/story-rZ5pnvBTi5lHiUOOCJxL9O.html
11-06-2020||World||A booming airline business: shipping pigs to China in 747 jumbo jets||Volga-Dnepr Group has flown more than 3,000 breeding pigs to China from France this year. The animals -- transported 6,450 miles (10,400 kilometers) in wooden crates in the hold of a Boeing 747 cargo plane -- are being used to restore local livestock levels to help mitigate shortages in the world’s largest pork market after an outbreak of African swine fever decimated China’s hog herds.Measures to stem the spread of the coronavirus amplified those swine shortages and accelerated attempts to boost the population of domestic herds. China imported a total 254,533 tons of pork in the first four months of the year from the US, which overtook Europe to become China’s largest pork supplier. That’s already more than the 245,000 tons China bought for the whole of 2019.The cargo is a sign of the shifting demand that Isaykin’s company -- known for transporting everything from satellites to emergency bridges -- is experiencing as the pandemic reshapes his industry.The company is also shipping masks, hazmat suits, medical equipment and even street-disinfecting vehicles to countries like Russia, France and Germany as they battle to contain the virus. Volga-Dnepr’s sales rose 32% to $630 million this year through April compared with the same period in 2019.“Global aviation is going through its most challenging time ever, but for cargo carriers like us it’s a chance,” Isaykin said in a Zoom interview from Moscow. “Previously, more than half of all aviation cargoes were carried in the luggage compartments of passenger planes. With this supply vanishing from the market, demand for cargo airlines surged and prices more than doubled.”While demand for air freight dropped 28% in April compared with a year earlier, capacity fell by 42%, according to the International Air Transport Association. Isaykin’s stake in closely held Volga-Dnepr is estimated to be worth around $700 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The Russian company’s revenue may increase by a third this year to $2 billion, Isaykin predicts.Expanding GeographyThe overall rise in sales has come even as some revenue streams shrink. Shipments for the aerospace industry have fallen by about a third compared with last year, Isaykin said.Medical goods now account for more than half of global air freight, with e-commerce cargo for firms like Amazon.com Inc. and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. another growing category.Volga-Dnepr’s footprint is also shifting, Isaykin said.“The geography of our shipments is expanding, following the spread of coronavirus,” Isaykin said. “We just started shipping Chinese medical goods to Africa and are getting first inquiries from Latin America. I think India will be next.”Some of this demand may prove to be short-lived. Freight rates have started to decline, and the market for shipping health-related cargo may drop in the second half of the year, Isaykin said. Still, he expects volumes and prices to stay above the “pre-virus” level with fewer passenger planes expected to be flying.Some new business may herald lasting changes to the world economy. While his carrier is shipping pigs to China, it’s also ferrying assets the other way. The company recently transported a production line for making masks to Russia’s Tatarstan region from China.“An interesting trend is gaining traction now -- we call it the medieval period of the 21st century -- when strategically important production facilities are being relocated to reduce dependence on China,” Isaykin said. “I am expecting this trend to accelerate toward year-end.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-booming-airline-business-shipping-pigs-to-china-in-747-jumbo-jets/story-v7DWJK08446uQSlUWEryKK.html
11-06-2020||World||Troubled Iran struggles to maintain sway over Iraqi militias||Iraqi militia factions expected the usual cash handout when the new head of Iran’s expeditionary Quds Force made his first visit to Baghdad earlier this year, succeeding the slain Gen. Qassim Soleimani. Instead, to their disappointment, Esmail Ghaani brought them silver rings. For his second visit, Ghaani had to apply for a visa, something unheard of in Soleimani’s time — a bold step by Baghdad’s new government effectively curtailing Iran’s freedom of movement inside Iraq. The episodes, relayed to The Associated Press by several Iraqi officials, illustrate Iran’s struggles to maintain sway over Iraqi militias six months after America assassinated Soleimani and top militia leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis in a drone strike. Iran at the same time is grappling with the economic fallout from US sanctions and the coronavirus outbreak. Without imposing figures like Soleimani and al-Muhandis to unify disparate factions, divisions have emerged in the Popular Mobilization Forces, the umbrella group of mainly Shiite forces. Their deaths also disrupted a trajectory to institutionalize the militias, which al-Muhandis had been meticulously planning with Soleimani’s blessing. “With al-Muhandis gone, there is an absence of an anchor around which (PMF) politics revolves,” said Fanar Haddad, an Iraq researcher. Among Iraq’s Shiite political and militia factions, Soleimani, a chief architect of Iran’s proxy groups across the region, held almost legendary status. Charismatic and a fluent Arabic speaker, his rapport with Iraqi officials was unmatched. He slipped in and out of Iraq regularly to plan, mediate and give out cash assistance. One surprise visit by him was sufficient to broker agreement between rival factions, officials said. Since his death, Shiite factions have shown discord, arguing over a premier candidate twice before they settled on Mustafa al-Kadhimi. Soleimani’s successor as Quds Force commander, Ghaani, is less familiar with Iraqi militia leaders and speaks to them through an interpreter. Meetings in Iraq have increasingly been handled by Iranian Ambassador Iraj Masjedi, himself a former Quds Force member. Ghaani’s gift of silver rings — symbolically important in Shiite Islam — rather than cash came during a meeting in April with leaders of several militia factions, according to three officials. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to talk to the press. Ghaani told them that, for the moment, they would have to rely on Iraqi state funding, they said, a sign of Iran’s economic crisis. The PMF are paid primarily through the state — $2 billion in the 2019 budget — but the funds are not dispersed equally. Smaller Iranian-backed groups rely on other informal means of revenue and receive extras from Iran, roughly $3-9 million, two Iraqi officials close to the militias said. The PMF was created in 2014 as a framework to organize and pay the thousands who volunteered to fight the Islamic State group after a fatwa by Iraq’s top cleric, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. Since then, its political and military might has soared. Under the staunchly pro-Iranian al-Muhandis, it became a channel for Tehran’s influence. His death opened the door for factions opposed to that influence — particularly ones associated with al-Sistani — to break from the PMF leadership. Militias complain that Iran-friendly groups receive preferential treatment. The man seen as al-Muhandis’ likely successor, Abdulaziz al-Mohammadawi, known as Abu Fadak, met opposition from factions who saw him as the Iranian-backed choice. He has not been officially recognized by the prime minister, though he has assumed some administrative duties, according to officials. Some of the most Iran-friendly militias under the PMF have shown signs of splintering. Attacks against US forces in March were claimed by a purported new group, Usbat al-Thairen, believed to have emerged from the powerful Kataib Hezbollah, which the US accused in previous attacks. Recently, four militias affiliated with the shrines connected to al-Sistani said they would take orders directly from Iraq’s premier, bypassing the PMF leadership. A senior official from Kataib Hezbollah said the move has weakened the PMF and its legitimacy among the public. For many Iraqis, the group’s credibility is derived from al-Sistani’s fatwa. The fissure was plain to see when, weeks into his leadership, Prime Minister al-Kadhimi visited the PMF headquarters. To his right, sat figures friendly with Tehran, to his left, those affiliated with al-Sistani. It marks a “major wrench” by the Shiite establishment led by al-Sistani into Iran’s broader plans, said Randa Slim, director of the Conflict Resolution and Track II Dialogues Program at the Middle East Institute. “They are basically saying we do not want an organ that takes its orders from Iran,” she said.

Health officials say it can be safe, as long as swimmers stick to social distancing guidelines in and out of the water.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there is no evidence that the virus that causes Covid-19 can spread from person to person in water in pools, hot tubs, oceans or lakes.Pool disinfectants like chlorine should also kill the virus, providing another layer of protection.But crowds still pose a risk. That’s why communities that are reopening pools and beaches are instituting temporary rules limiting capacity and requiring facial masks.Health authorities say people heading to the beach or pool this summer should follow the same advice for anyone in public: stay at least six feet from people you don’t live with, wear a facial covering around others, wash your hands frequently and stay home if you’re not feeling well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-it-safe-to-go-swimming-during-the-coronavirus-pandemic/story-X43Y7zguv3ol3FeW5XOYjM.html

They said they had tried many times to remove it through the political process, but without success.State Patrol troopers in helmets, who provide security in the Capitol complex, stood by at a distance but did not try to stop the protesters, who celebrated afterward with Native American singing and drumming.The troopers eventually formed a line to protect the toppled statue so it could be taken away.The protest followed a similar incident Tuesday night in Richmond, Virginia, and another in Boston.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/christopher-columbus-statue-pulled-down-in-st-paul-during-black-lives-matter-protest/story-7tlsz3mG76tci0HRdpnO7N.html
11-06-2020||World||Australian PM draws criticism for ‘no slavery in Australia’ comment||Australian officials warned Black Lives Matter supporters they could be arrested if they breach coronavirus restrictions to take part in public protests, as debate erupted over the country’s own indigenous history.Prime Minister Scott Morrison drew strong criticism on Thursday after he said “there was no slavery in Australia” during a discussion of the early days of British settlement, which he acknowledged was “pretty brutal.”Historians, Aboriginal activists and some lawmakers expressed shock and dismay at the comments.“Slavery of indigenous, men, women and children is well documented,” said Sharman Stone, a former federal lawmaker and now politics professor at Monash University. “Slaves worked in pearling, fishing, the pastoral industries and as domestic labour.” The Black Lives Matter movement has refocused attention in Australia on the mistreatment of indigenous Australians, including Aboriginal deaths in custody.Victoria state officials confirmed on Thursday that one of eight new cases of Covid-19 reported on Thursday was a man who attended the Melbourne weekend rally. More unauthorised protests are planned for Friday. “We will start writing tickets of A$1,000 ($700) and we can use all of our powers to move people on,” New South Wales Police Commissioner Mick Fuller told 2GB Radio. “If you don’t move on, well then you’ll be arrested.” Morrison rejected growing calls to remove statues of white leaders, including one of the country’s first prime minister, Edmund Barton, which is located near an Aboriginal burial site. Barton played a key role in drafting the national constitution, which negated Aboriginal rights. Morrison said the initial motives of protesters were “fair”, but the push for removal of the statues was being driven by political agendas.Australia on Tuesday recorded its first day without any community transmissions of Covid-19 since the crisis began. It has recorded 7,285 cases, including 102 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-draws-criticism-for-no-slavery-in-australia-comment/story-Xqet0keXfbZIlRKwjLz7nL.html
11-06-2020||World||‘WHO assesses situation only through health lens’: Pak official defends govt’s Covid-19 strategy||A top Pakistani health official asserted that the government is following a “holistic” strategy to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic. Special Assistant to the Prime Minister on Health Dr Zafar Mirza, however, ruled out adopting World Health Organisation’s (WHO) recommendation of implementing a two-week strict lockdown, intermittently, to stem the exponential spike in the coronavirus cases.“We have made best sovereign decisions in the best interest of our people. We have to make tough policy choices to strike a balance between lives and livelihoods,” Mirza said on Wednesday on the government’s decision to ease lockdown when cases are increasing.He said that Pakistan has consciously but gradually eased generalised lockdowns but at the same time has focused on enforcement of standard operating procedures (SOPs) in shops, industry, mosques and public transport.Mirza said Pakistan’s choice of policies has been guided by the best evidence available about the disease spread and the best assessment of the fast deteriorating socio-economic conditions in the country.“WHO is a UN specialised technical agency on health... we understand that it is their role to provide recommendations to member states but understandably theirs is the health lens, whereas governments have to take into account a holistic picture and make decisions on relative risk assessment basis and this has been the case in Pakistan all along,” he said.Mirza said that the government has made wearing face masks compulsory. It has also developed a robust tracing, testing and quarantine policy to identify hotspots and cordon-off them, he added.Several media outlets in Pakistan reported that the WHO had written a letter to the health minister of Pakistan’s Punjab province last week, in which the global health body said that the virus has spread all over the country, and a large number of cases had been recorded in big cities.The letter appreciated Pakistan’s efforts in fighting Covid-19, but warned that recent statistics suggest its current strategy was not paying off.It recommended that the government adopt a two-week-on, two-week-off lockdown, as it offered the most chance of continuing economic activities while ensuring public health, media reports said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-assesses-situation-only-through-health-lens-pak-official-defends-govt-s-covid-19-strategy/story-77YqDTdFTdwDpSCX0zZTFN.html

I’m excited about tonight. There’s a lot of emotions on the race track.”Wallace wore a black “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirt - which were George Floyd’s last words to officers restraining him - but did not kneel during the national anthem.His Chevy had “Compassion, Love, Understanding” emblazoned on the hood.In a video posted on Richard Petty Motorsports’ Twitter account earlier, Wallace had said, “I think it’s going to speak volumes for what I stand for, but also what the initiative that NASCAR, the whole sport, is trying to push.”Ahead of the race, NASCAR outlawed the display of the confederate flag at its events. The flag was a common and complicated sight at NASCAR races. Through the civil rights era right on through the season opener at Daytona in February, the flag dotted infield campsites and was waved in grandstands by fans young and old.Floyd, a black man, died May 25 after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed his knee into Floyd’s neck while Floyd was handcuffed and saying that he couldn’t breathe. His death sparked protests that have roiled the nation for days, and Confederate monuments are being taken down across the South - the traditional fan base for NASCAR.The decision had Confederate flag loyalists howling in protest and vowing to swear off the sport.Fans have not been allowed back at races yet amid the coronavirus pandemic. It won’t be long: NASCAR plans to welcome a small number of fans at a race Sunday near Miami and more later this month in Alabama.NASCAR has had a checkered history with race and it took another blow when driver Kyle Larson was fired in April after he uttered a racial slur during a live-streamed virtual race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nascar-s-bubba-wallace-races-with-black-live-matter-scheme-on-car/story-JmmAfhoNWSCYAJ5PBVN1wN.html
11-06-2020||World||Indian-origin doctor couple begin legal battle with UK govt over PPEs||An Indian-origin husband-wife doctor couple have launched judicial review proceedings against the UK government over what they say is a refusal to address safety issues around personal protective equipment (PPE) for doctors and healthcare workers during the coronavirus pandemic.Dr Nishant Joshi and his pregnant wife, Dr Meenal Viz, had initiated the legal action in April with a pre-action letter seeking answers from the UK’s Department of Health and Social Care and Public Health England. They decided to push ahead with the case in the High Court in London on Wednesday because they feel they are “no longer willing to wait”.“We don’t want to be doing this. We didn’t plan on doing this. We’re doctors in a pandemic. We want to focus on saving lives and stitching this country back together,” the couple said in a statement.“But we have been pushed into taking action by the government’s refusal to address the issues we have raised,” they said.Their law firm, Bindmans, said the judicial review challenge highlights the “mismatch” between the government’s guidance on PPE and the guidance set out by the World Health Organisation (WHO), including in respect of when “full” PPE is required, as well as with respect to the reuse and reprocessing of PPE - which includes items such surgical gowns, face visors and gloves. The doctors’ case claims that the government’s guidance also fails properly to warn healthcare and social care workers of the risks they face with different levels of PPE and their legal rights to refuse to work when inadequate PPE is available.“As frontline doctors, Dr Viz and Dr Joshi understand the operational pressures faced by government better than most, but they, along with all other health and social care workers, remain entitled to lawful and transparent guidance on the use of PPE and the risks they are facing on the frontline of responding to this national crisis,” said Jamie Potter, Partner at Bindmans LLP and solicitor for Dr Viz and Dr Joshi.“Accordingly, we have today [Wednesday] filed judicial review proceedings seeking to challenge that guidance with a view to bringing into line with WHO guidance as well as human rights legislation. This is important not just in the current crisis, but also to any ‘second spike’ or future pandemic,” he said.The couple highlight that a disproportionate number of the COVID-19 victims are from ethnic minority backgrounds, and the challenge also raises the government’s failure properly to consider the impact on black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) health and social care workers across the state-funded National Health Service (NHS). “The government have also refused to allow Dr Viz and Dr Joshi to publish their initial responses to the pre-action correspondence so that others can assess the adequacy of their approach to PPE. Our clients will push in any proceedings to ensure such documents are made public,” their law firm said.The couple’s online crowdfunding initiative for the legal case has raised over 61,000 pounds in pledges. Viz, who is eight months pregnant, has also been leading protests outside Downing Street and last month she and her colleagues observed a 237-second silence - one second for every healthcare worker who died in the line of duty during this pandemic in the UK.The Department of Health said it cannot comment on “ongoing legal proceedings” but has in the past stressed that safety factors have been taken into account with its guidance.

11-06-2020||World||Authorities probe radio, website disruptions during Black Lives Matter protests||Authorities are investigating interference with police radio communications, websites and networks used by law enforcement and other officials during recent US protests over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis.Although the efforts to disrupt police radios and take down websites in Minnesota, Illinois and Texas aren’t considered technically difficult hacks, federal intelligence officials warned that law enforcement should be ready for such tactics as protests continue.Authorities have not yet identified anyone responsible or provided details about how the disruptions were carried out. But officials were particularly concerned by interruptions to police radio frequencies during the last weekend of May as dispatchers tried to direct responses to large protests and unrest that overshadowed peaceful demonstrations.During protests in Dallas on May 31, someone gained access to the police department’s unencrypted radio frequency and disrupted officers’ communications by playing music over their radios, according to a June 1 intelligence assessment from the US Department of Homeland Security.Dallas police did not respond to questions about the incident.The assessment, which was obtained by The Associated Press, attributes the Dallas disruption to “unknown actors” and does not say how they accessed the radio frequency. It warned that attacks of various types would likely persist.“Short-term disruptive cyber activities related to protests probably will continue — various actors could be carrying out these operations — with the potential to use more impactful capabilities, like ransomware, or target higher profile networks,” the assessment warns.The assessment noted similar problems with Chicago police’s unencrypted radio frequencies during large downtown protests on May 30 followed by reports of arson, theft and vandalism. Chicago police also have not said how the radio frequencies were accessed, but an official with the city’s Office of Emergency Management and Communications told the Chicago Sun-Times that the tactic was “very dangerous.”Police around the country have encrypted their radio communications, often arguing that it’s a way to protect officers and block criminals from listening in on widely available phone apps that broadcast police radio channels. But media outlets and local hobbyists have been frustrated by the changes, which also prevent them from reporting on issues pertaining to public safety.The Department of Homeland Security issued a separate warning this week reporting that personal information of police officers nationwide is being leaked online, a practice known as “doxxing.” According to the report obtained by the AP, information shared on social media included home addresses, email addresses and phone numbers.Law enforcement agencies have been targeted by online pranksters or hackers in recent years, including by some who claimed to be motivated by on-the-ground protests against police tactics. For example, the hacking collective Anonymous claimed responsibility for the defacement of local police departments’ websites in 2012 as protesters clashed with officers during the Occupy Wall Street movement.Individuals who self-identified as being part of the collective also claimed to have accessed dispatch tapes and other Ferguson Police Department records in 2014 after a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man.Like other government entities, law enforcement agencies in recent years have been frequently targeted by ransomware attacks, in which a perpetrator virtually locks up a victim’s computer files or system and demands payment to release them.The prevalence of cyberattacks — which can cause physical damage or far-reaching disruption — and less severe online trickery, such as stealing passwords, has given law enforcement agencies more experience at fending off efforts to take down their websites or access critical information. But hackers adapt too, and governments with fewer resources than private companies often struggle to keep up, said Morgan Wright, chief security officer for the cybersecurity company SentinelOne.“The biggest concern they have right now is the safety of their communities, the safety of their officers,” Wright said of how law enforcement agencies view cyberthreats amid large demonstrations and unrest. “But if you look at what underpins everything we use to communicate, collaborate and operate, it’s all technology.”As large protests gathered steam after the May 25 death of Floyd, a handcuffed black man who died after a white Minneapolis police officer used his knee to pin his neck down for several minutes, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said state networks had been targeted. He described the activity as a “a very sophisticated denial of service attack.”But experts said the strategy of bombarding a website with traffic is common and doesn’t always take a high level of skill, counter to Walz’s description. Minnesota’s Chief Information Officer Tarek Tomes later said state services weren’t disrupted.But the efforts got a lot of attention, partly due to unverified online claims that Anonymous was responsible after years of infrequent activity. The decentralized group largely went quiet in 2015 but is still known globally based on headline-grabbing cyberattacks against Visa and MasterCard, the Church of Scientology and law enforcement agencies.Twitter users also made unverified claims that Anonymous was behind recent intermittent outages on the city government’s website in the Texas capital of Austin. Their posts indicated that the disruption was retribution for police officers shooting a 20-year-old black man in the head with a bean bag during a May 31 protest outside of police headquarters.The injured protester, identified by family as Justin Howell, remained hospitalized Wednesday in critical condition.The city’s IT department was looking into the site’s issues, but a spokesman said Monday that he couldn’t provide any information about the cause. He said the website was still experiencing a high volume of traffic.“You should have expected us,” an account purporting to be Anonymous’ posted on Twitter. It also warned that “new targets are coming soon.”The collective’s approach — anyone can act in its name — makes it difficult to verify the recent claims of responsibility. But Twitter accounts long affiliated with Anonymous shared them, said Gabriella Coleman, a professor at McGill University in Montreal who has studied the Anonymous movement for years.People with more advanced and disruptive hacking skills often drove peak instances of attention for Anonymous, and it’s not clear whether that type of activity will resume, she added.“There’s a lot of things going on in the background, people are chatting,” Coleman said. “Whether or not it materializes is another question. But certainly people are kind of aroused and talking and connecting.”___Foody reported from Chicago.

11-06-2020||World||Retired judge calls effort to drop case against ex-Trump aide ‘gross abuse’ of power||A retired judge urged a federal court on Wednesday not to allow the Justice Department to dismiss its criminal case against President Donald Trump’s former adviser Michael Flynn, citing evidence of a “gross abuse of prosecutorial power.”The US district judge hearing the case, Emmet Sullivan, tapped John Gleeson last month to serve as a “friend of the court,” after the Justice Department abruptly asked the court to dismiss the criminal charge against Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general.The stunning move by the Justice Department followed a pressure campaign by Trump and his allies and came even though Flynn had twice pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with former Russian Ambassador to the United States Sergey Kislyak. “The Department of Justice has a solemn responsibility to prosecute this case — like every other case — without fear or favor,” Gleeson wrote. “It has abdicated that responsibility through a gross abuse of prosecutorial power, attempting to provide special treatment to a favored friend and political ally of the President of the United States.”He said Sullivan should proceed with sentencing Flynn. A Justice Department spokeswoman declined to comment beyond what the government has already argued in court filings.Flynn was one of several former Trump aides charged under former Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation that detailed Moscow’s interference in the 2016 US presidential election. Gleeson said there was “ample evidence in the record that Flynn committed perjury,” or lied under oath.He recommended that Sullivan take Flynn’s perjury into account when sentencing him for lying to the FBI, rather than commencing a follow-on prosecution.Despite admitting twice under oath to lying to the FBI and agreeing to cooperate, Flynn later changed legal tactics and his attorneys now allege the FBI entrapped him.The Justice Department now says the FBI investigation that led to the charge lacked an adequate legal basis and that Flynn’s statements, even if untrue, were not material. “The reasons offered by the government are so irregular, and so obviously pretextual, that they are deficient,” Gleeson wrote in response. “They reveal an unconvincing effort to disguise as legitimate a decision to dismiss that is based solely on the fact that Flynn is a political ally of President Trump.”Gleeson highlighted the conversations that Flynn had with Kislyak that led to the false-statement charge, and compared them against how Flynn portrayed them during his January 2017 FBI interview.A transcript showed Flynn telling Kislyak he wanted to avoid a “tit for tat” over sanctions the United States imposed on Russia for its interference in the 2016 election.Flynn has also asked an appeals court to force Sullivan to accept the request to drop the case. Arguments in that case are set for Friday.“This Court must stop him (Sullivan) before he further jeopardizes the legitimacy of the federal judiciary,” Flynn told the appeals court in a court filing on Wednesday.Sullivan has said he cannot serve as a “rubber stamp” and must carefully review the facts in this “unprecedented” request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/retired-judge-calls-effort-to-drop-case-against-ex-trump-aide-gross-abuse-of-power/story-FZUENgqJDT5OxuFljyDBUN.html
11-06-2020||World||Prez Trump rejects removing names of Confederate leaders from US military bases||President Donald Trump ruled out renaming US military bases that are named for Confederate leaders on Wednesday even as NASCAR banned the Confederate flag from its races and Democrats sought the removal from Capitol Hill of statues of people representing the pro-slavery South in the 1860s Civil War.With Americans more conscious about race issues in the wake of the death of African American George Floyd while in Minneapolis police custody, Trump drew a line in favour of keeping the names of 10 military bases from Virginia to Texas that are named for Confederate military leaders.Trump’s announcement via tweet basically slapped down those Pentagon officials open to discussing the issue, which has emerged as a way of achieving racial reconciliation.In the past few days, officials have said that the Pentagon, including Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy, was open to having a bipartisan conversation about renaming the Army bases named for Confederate leaders.In a series of tweets, Trump argued the bases have become part of a “Great American Heritage.”“The United States of America trained and deployed our HEROES on these Hallowed Grounds, and won two World Wars. Therefore, my Administration will not even consider the renaming of these Magnificent and Fabled Military Installations...,” Trump wrote in a tweet.The issue of the enslavement of African Americans tore the United States apart when Southern states broke away to form the Confederate States of America to protect slavery. Northern states defeated the South in the Civil War to restore the Union.But slavery’s legacy continues to haunt race relations in America. In recent history, controversies over symbols of the Confederacy, such as statues of its leaders and its battle flag, have erupted. Those arguing for their removal say they symbolize racism and oppression, while those opposing such action call them signifiers of Southern heritage and pride.NASCAR, whose races frequently feature fans waving the Confederate battle flag, said on Wednesday it would ban the “stars and bars” flag from its events.On Capitol Hill, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi urged Congress to immediately take steps to remove from the US Capitol 11 statues representing Confederate leaders and soldiers. Among the statues is one of Confederate military commander Robert E. Lee.“Their statues pay homage to hate, not heritage. They must be removed,” Pelosi, a Democrat, said in a letter to leaders of a congressional committee in charge of managing the statues on display at the Capitol. US military bases named for Confederate military leaders are all located in former Confederate states. Many of those states helped elect Trump in 2016, and he is counting on them again for the Nov. 3 election.In an article published Tuesday in The Atlantic, retired General and former CIA chief David Petraeus called for renaming the bases, pointing out that the men they are named for “committed treason, however much they may have agonized over it” by fighting for the Confederacy. At a news briefing Wednesday, White House spokeswoman Kayleigh McEnany noted that the HBO Max streaming service had withdrawn the Civil War movie “Gone with the Wind” and asked “Where do you draw the line?”“Should George Washington and Thomas Jefferson be erased from history?” she said of the first and third American presidents, both of whom owned slaves.She said renaming the bases was “an absolute non-starter for the president.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prez-trump-rejects-removing-names-of-confederate-leaders-from-us-military-bases/story-vHpUAqSKKJP2w0LbzljuGO.html
11-06-2020||World||‘Unprecedented infodemic’: EU slams China, Russia for misinformation campaign||China and Russia were blamed for spewing out false and misleading online information about Covid-19 in a European Union report that seeks to stem the “unprecedented” spread of fake news amid the pandemic.The two nations are among “foreign actors” that sought to “undermine democratic debate” and enhance their own image through “targeted influence operations and disinformation campaigns around Covid-19 in the EU,” the bloc’s executive authority said in the report published on Wednesday.“It would be too dangerous not to act,” European Commission Vice President Vera Jourova told reporters in Brussels. She said the pandemic “showed us that false information could do serious harm, could kill citizens even and could undermine the public authorities’ response and therefore also weaken the measures taken.”The commission has in recent months stepped up pressure on platforms such as Twitter Inc. and Facebook Inc. to help stem the flow of misleading content about the virus, vaccines or alleged cures on their sites. It’s part of a broader goal to fight hate speech and disinformation online that could lead to new EU regulation to make tech giants more accountable and responsible.The EU said in the report there’s been an “unprecedented infodemic” that has fed on “people’s most basic anxieties” as most of them were forced to stay socially confined and revert to an increased use of social media to access information. “Given the novelty of the virus, gaps in knowledge have proven to be an ideal breeding ground for false or misleading narratives to spread.”Propaganda CampaignThe EU’s findings on China and Russia are based on a separate study by the commission’s foreign and diplomatic wing, which said it had evidence of a “coordinated push” by official Chinese sources to deflect blame for the coronavirus pandemic and promote its response to the virus. EU foreign-policy chief Josep Borrell, who heads the service, has worked with Jourova over the last few weeks on the latest plans.The accusations against Russia and China reflect EU efforts to find an “external enemy” to paper over European divisions exposed by the pandemic, Leonid Slutsky, head of the foreign affairs committee of the Russian lower house of parliament, said according to state news service RIA Novosti. China’s foreign ministry didn’t respond to a request for comment.State-sponsored foreign propaganda preys on people’s “fears and doubts,” said Jourova. A “geopolitical EU can only materialize if we are assertive and name the issues we face. But we also have to put our own house in order” and “beef up our own strategic communication” to prevent others from claiming this space online.Online platforms will have a key role to play by being more transparent about what’s happening online and where misleading information is coming from. A code of conduct on disinformation that five tech giants, including Twitter, Facebook and Google, signed up to so far, is only a first step, said Jourova, adding that ByteDance Ltd.’s social media app TikTok said they also plan to sign up to the code, and that the EU is in negotiations with Facebook’s WhatsApp too.‘Not Good Enough’“We only know as much as platforms tell us” and “this is not good enough; platforms have to open up,” she said.Companies that are part of the code will have to publish monthly reports that include data on policies aimed at limiting ad placements related to Covid-19 disinformation, both on their own sites and on third-party websites, the EU said. While the commission is unlikely to propose hard legislation to regulate harmful disinformation, it’s working on a more “balanced proposal,” Jourova said.The report comes as Hungary -- an EU member state -- faces criticism for preparing a national survey that includes a question on a coronavirus crisis proposal by investor George Soros that “experts say will force nations into debt slavery.”In the “national consultation” due to be mailed to all Hungarian citizens, the government asks whether people should “reject George Soros’s plan, which would in-debt our homeland for an unforeseeable long time.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unprecedented-infodemic-eu-slams-china-russia-for-misinformation-campaign/story-zMg7dm1GQE2I1VAnJy4ibK.html
11-06-2020||World||China offers shots to workers going abroad amid Covid-19 vaccine race||China is offering employees of some large state-run companies the option of being inoculated with two coronavirus vaccines currently in development, showing how quickly the country is moving to test the viability of its homegrown shots.Employees intending to travel overseas for work can volunteer to be administered vaccinations developed by China National Biotec Group Co. or CNBG, a subsidiary of Beijing-based Sinopharm Group Co., according to people familiar with the matter who asked not to be identified as the offer hasn’t been made public. The proposal was relayed to state-owned companies by the government body that oversees them, the people said.CNBG is among the Chinese companies bidding to create a successful vaccine against the new coronavirus. There are currently five Chinese vaccine candidates in the human trial stage, competing with products being developed by global pharmaceutical companies such as AstraZeneca Plc and Moderna Inc. that can bring an end to the pandemic and allow countries to reopen more fully after economically-punishing lockdowns and travel curbs.Beijing has mobilized its health authorities, drug regulators and research institutes to work around the clock with local companies to come up with the world’s first effective vaccine for Covid-19. If China is successful in the race, it would wield immense geopolitical clout. President Xi Jinping has promised to share any vaccine globally.CNBG’s experimental shots have been tested on 2,000 people with no reported “obvious adverse effects,” Sinopharm Chairman Liu Jingzhen told local media last month. A CNBG spokeswoman said she was not aware of the vaccine offer and declined to comment further.The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or SASAC, which oversees China’s government-run companies, didn’t immediately respond to a Bloomberg query.Generate DataIf state-run company workers avail themselves of the vaccination, not only will they potentially be protected against the virus but their experience could help generate data on the shots’ efficacy in beating the pathogen that has sickened over 7.2 million people and killed more than 411,000 worldwide.It isn’t yet known whether CNBG’s vaccines, which employ a dead strain of the novel coronavirus to elicit an immune response from the body, can prevent the infection.The experimental vaccines are currently in Phase II trials and being evaluated for their safety on humans. Their ability to prevent infection of the virus will only be clear in Phase III trials -- the final hurdle to clear for securing marketing approval -- in which thousands of people take the shot to see how effective it is in an active outbreak environment.With China’s cases dwindling to only a handful a day, the vaccines will need to be tested overseas where infections are still growing.It’s uncertain how many employees of state-run firms have taken up the offer and whether they will be tracked for adverse reactions and their immune response. However, their exposure abroad may give an early view into the vaccines’ potential in places where the virus is not yet under control.In addition to the ongoing clinical trial, Sinopharm’s Liu and hundreds of the company’s senior managers and employees have voluntarily taken the shots, according to Chinese news reports. CNBG is building factories that will enable the vaccine maker to churn out more than 200 million doses annually, it has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-offers-shots-to-workers-going-abroad-amid-covid-19-vaccine-race/story-l8SUtEQhHl6EI2Fn6wHTgN.html
11-06-2020||World||US could reach 200,000 Covid-19 deaths in September, says expert||The United States may see 200,000 deaths because of the coronavirus at some point in September, a leading expert said, while total US coronavirus cases surpassed 2 million on Wednesday as governments relax restrictions.Ashish Jha, the head of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, told CNN in an interview on Wednesday that without drastic action, the number of US deaths would march on.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“Even if we don’t have increasing cases, even if we keep things flat, it’s reasonable to expect that we’re going to hit 200,000 deaths sometime during the month of September,” Jha said. “And that’s just through September. The pandemic won’t be over in September.”Jha added: “I’m really worried about where we’re going to be in the weeks and months ahead.”Total US coronavirus-related deaths totaled 112,754 on Wednesday, the most in the world. Jha said that was directly tied to the fact the United States was the only major country to reopen without getting its case growth to a controlled level - a rate of people testing positive for the coronavirus remaining at 5% or lower for at least 14 days.He said the deaths were not “something we have to be fated with” and could be prevented by ramping up testing and contact tracing, strict social distancing and widespread use of masks.Several US states have seen coronavirus cases jump in recent days, causing great concern among Jha and other experts who say authorities are loosening restrictions too early.New Mexico, Utah, and Utah each saw its number of cases rise by 40% for the week ended Sunday, according to a Reuters analysis. Florida and Arkansas are other hot spots.Nationally, new infections are rising slightly after five weeks of declines, according to a Reuters analysis that showed total cases at 2,003,038.Part of the increase is due to more testing, which hit a record high last Friday of 545,690 tests in a single day but has since fallen, according to the Covid-Tracking Project https://Covidtracking.com.It is also likely a result of more people moving about and resuming some business and social activities as all 50 states gradually reopen after lockdowns designed to curb the spread of the coronavirus.Health officials urged anyone who took part in nationwide protests for racial justice to get tested. Experts fear that the protests, with no social distancing, that have occurred since the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis police custody could lead to another spike in cases.But Vice President Mike Pence said he saw no sign of that.“What I can tell you is that, at this point, we don’t see an increase in new cases now, nearly two weeks on from when the first protests took effect,” Pence said in an interview on Fox Business Network. “Many people at protests were wearing masks and engaging in some social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-could-reach-200-000-covid-19-deaths-in-september-says-expert/story-vwliQq2D6OcCriHtIDhVhK.html

On Tuesday it was revealed that a consultation is underway which could lead to road being renamed Guru Nanak Road. Southall is home to a large Sikh community and Havelock Road is home to the Sri Guru Singh Sabha, which is considered the largest Gurdwara in the world outside India.The consultation is part of a wider process, launched this week by the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, to re-evaluate memorials - including statues and public spaces - that commemorate British colonialism sparked by the global Black Lives Matter protests.Several statues of British slave traders have been removed in the UK whilst protestors defaced a statue of Winston Churchill - revered by some for his role in defeating Nazism and reviled by others for his part in tragedies such as the Bengal Famine of the early 1940’s as well as his opposition to Indian independence.In a video message to residents of the area, Councillor Julian Bell, leader of Ealing Council said he welcomed the Mayor’s initiative to represent London’s diversity.“I welcome the Mayor’s announcement today of a review of our public spaces across the city to make sure that they do represent London as it is today. Our diversity is our strength and we need to make sure that our public realm, our statues, our road names, our buildings, reflect our diversity and do not reflect a frozen past where colonialism, racism and the slave trade were present and celebrated,” Bell said.The change of names will “symbolise the huge contribution of our Sikh community in Ealing and also diversity as a borough, and also it will represent our unity as a borough too”, he added.The move was also welcomed by the long-standing MP for the area Virendra Sharma.“As the Member of Parliament for Ealing Southall and a Councillor for 25 years before that I have often been ashamed the names of empire still pervade our streets. I have long campaigned for schools to teach more about our Imperial past, not just the great strides made but also the shameful thuggery and violence, names like Havelock belong in books, classrooms and museums, not on the streets to be celebrated,” Sharma said.“The community should come together to decide how we rename this road, but celebrating Guru Nanak Dev Ji in his 550th anniversary, and erasing a white man who killed Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus, would be a sign of our multiculturalism and our diversity,” he added. ‘a sign of our multiculturalism’: UK’s Havelock Road, named after general who dismantled India’s first war for Independence, to be renamed Guru Nanak MargA consultation to rename Havelock road will begin “very shortly”, according to Councillor Bell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/road-named-after-general-who-put-down-india-s-1st-battle-for-independence-could-be-renamed-guru-nanak-marg/story-jceUjvA2G3IZaRjpcoNnSK.html

Disneyland is the world’s second-most visited theme park, drawing tens of thousands of visitors each day, but it closed in mid-March due to coronavirus concerns.The move comes on the heels of the successful reopening of Shanghai Disneyland last month, and follows a similar timetable to the restart of Disney World in Florida, which has already received government approval.Theme parks provide a significant portion of the Mouse House’s revenue. Last month, Disney said the division’s quarterly operating income fell 58 percent from a year earlier, largely due to the coronavirus pandemic.When the California parks reopen, all guests will need to book reservations in advance, and social distancing measures mean no parades or “nighttime spectaculars” until a later date.“While character meet-and-greets will be temporarily unavailable, characters will be in the parks in new ways to entertain and delight guests,” Disney said in a statement.Hotels at the site would reopen the following week under the scheme.The plans were unveiled as calls on social media and a Change.org petition grew for Disney’s parks to rebrand their “Splash Mountain” rides. The popular log flumes are based on the controversial 1946 Disney film “Song of the South” -- a movie long accused of peddling racist tropes about the post-Civil War South, and never released on home video in the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-disney-eyes-to-restart-california-theme-parks-in-july/story-hUpNtNVzRXlNaRg1XV1qIJ.html
11-06-2020||World||‘Post coronavirus, US is on its way to a very big comeback’: Trump||Now that people are getting their jobs back and the stock market is booming after the crisis triggered by coronavirus, the United States is on its way to a “very big comeback”, President Donald Trump has said. “We are on our way to a very big comeback,” Trump told reporters at the White House on Wednesday. The US, he said, is doing well in “so many ways”. “You see what’s going on with NASDAQ. We just broke another record yesterday. Some good news came out of the Federal Reserve today, I think some very good news,” the President said. “We’re really doing a financial comeback. The jobs numbers were fantastic. Now we’ll have some other job numbers come up over the next few weeks, and we’ll see how that goes, but I think it’s really good,” Trump said. Trump asserted the next year will be “maybe the best ever economy” that the US has seen. “You can already see it with the stock market how it’s been going up because you have a lot of smart people that are betting on exactly what I’m saying because the stock market is almost as high as it was prior to the plague floating in from China,” he said. “It was a plague that floated in from China. Now they’re learning that it may have been much earlier, which bears out exactly what I’ve been saying. You saw that word yesterday that it may have come in a lot sooner than we were told,” he added. Earlier during a news conference, White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the President is encouraged because what “we’re seeing is a belief in the Trump economy and the Trump presidency”. “What we’re seeing is the market soar. We’re seeing the S&P have its best 50-day track record in history, because they believe in a President that has free-market policies that got us to the hottest economy in modern history and will get us there again,” she said. However, the Federal Reserve Wednesday offered a pretty grim economic outlook, saying unemployment is going to be elevated for years. Early this week, the National Bureau of Economic Research said that the US officially entered a recession. McEnany asserted that the US economy is back on track. “We believe that next month’s jobs report will be robust. The President has been clear that he expects Q3 to be a transition period, Q4 to be robust, and next year to be a very hot year. I would note that those in the prediction business, they were off by 10 million. That’s not too good,” she said.

11-06-2020||World||Trump administration proposes sweeping asylum restrictions||The Trump administration on Wednesday proposed sweeping — though somewhat vague — restrictions on asylum, seeking to align a legal framework with the president’s efforts to limit immigration to the United States.The moves are only the latest in a series of measures that Trump has taken to limit asylum — this time aimed at changing complicated procedures governing immigration courts.The Justice and Homeland Security departments said asylum-seekers who clear initial screenings will have claims heard by an immigration judge in “streamlined proceedings,” replacing longstanding rules in immigration law. They did not elaborate in a brief press release.The rules also will allow judges to dismiss cases without court hearings if supporting evidence is determined to be too weak. They will define when a claim may be declared “frivolous” and raise the threshold for initial screenings under the United Nations Convention Against Torture.The administration will propose new definitions for some ways people qualify for asylum, specifically “political opinion” and membership in a “particular social group.” Asylum is for people who face persecution for their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership in a social group, a loose category that may include victims of gang or domestic violence. Narrowing those ways to qualify would mean more rejected claims.The administration said the changes would bring more efficiency to an immigration court system with a backlog of more than 1.1 million cases.The rules will “more effectively separate baseless claims from meritorious ones,” the departments said. “This would better ensure groundless claims do not delay or divert resources from deserving claims.” Details will be published in the Federal Register with time for public comment before they take effect. Lawsuits may delay or derail the effort.The administration effectively put asylum out of reach for many people at the Canadian and Mexican borders in March under a 1944 public health law aimed at preventing spread of the coronavirus. The move, intended to be temporary, allowed the government to immediately expel people from Mexico and Central America to Mexico before they make an asylum claim.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-administration-proposes-sweeping-asylum-restrictions/story-PmwIvp4NxNy781X48U3gYN.html

A few also tried recollected the capture of IAF Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman when he crossed the border. During a counter-attack to the Balakot strikes last year in February, Varthaman managed to let off a short-range R73 missile against an intruding F16, which brought it down.During the engagement, his MiG21 crossed the Line of Control (LoC) to retain the lockin on the target and was shot down either by a surface-to-air missile or another Pakistani jet. However, the Pakistani jets had retreated without causing any damage in India.“Since you are (or were) too close with the Pak Army, your words can be taken as solid. Anyways, we are not worry.

11-06-2020||World||Two Brazil governors under fire over alleged corruption related to Covid spending||Two Brazilian governors came under more fire Wednesday over allegations of corruption related to Covid-19 spending, with one having his home raided and another set to face an impeachment process.Federal police raided the government palace of Para state in the Amazon region as well Governor Helder Barbalho’s home as part of an investigation into alleged fraud in the purchase of ventilators for treating Covid-19. The search order targeted a total of 23 addresses in six states and Brazil’s federal district in Brasilia, police said in a statement.Barbalho is the second governor to be investigated in relation to suspect medical expenditures during the pandemic.On May 26, police searched the residence of Rio de Janeiro state Governor Wilson Witzel as part of an investigation into alleged irregularities in contracts awarded for the construction of emergency field hospitals. Rio legislators voted nearly unanimously Wednesday to begin impeachment proceedings against the governor.Witzel has promised eight emergency field hospitals, but only one has opened, near the Maracana soccer stadium.He denied any wrongdoing and said he was the victim of political persecution.“I am at ease about my innocence. I will keep on working as governor and will prepare my defense. I am sure that the deputies will judge the facts as they really are,“ said a statement from Witzel, who will continue in office unless the legislative process leads to his impeachment and removal.Both Witzel and Barbalho have criticized President Jair Bolsonaro’s rejection of quarantine measures to contain spread of the coronavirus.The alleged fraud in Para stemmed from the acquisition of ventilators worth millions of dollars, done so without a call for bids as allowed by state of emergency protocols during the pandemic. The equipment deployment was delayed and ultimately useless for patients with Covid-19, according to the police statement, which said investigators are looking into alleguations of money laundering and corruption.The judge who ordered the raid froze $5 million in the bank accounts of Barbalho and seven others, prosecutors said. They said there are indications the governor has a close relationship with the executive who supplied the ventilators and also knew they were inadequate.“I am at ease and available for any clarification. I acted in time to avoid damage to the treasury, since the resources were returned to the state,” Barbalho said on Twitter. “I am not a friend of the businessman and obviously did not know that the ventilators would not work.” During the operation, police found dozens of bundles of cash in a home belonging to Peter Cassol, former secretary of administrative management at the state health department, according to images shown by TV Globo. In the afternoon, the government announced Cassol’s dismissal.The Para government said in a statement that it had already gone to court to file for compensation from the suppliers for damages.Para is Brazil’s fourth hardest-hit state, with about 62,000 confirmed coronavirus cases and more than 3,900 deaths, according to official data, which is considered by experts to be a significant undercount.Bolsonaro changed the head of the federal police in April, sparking suspicion of political interference in the force as alleged by former Justice Minister Sérgio Moro, who resigned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-brazil-governors-under-fire-over-alleged-corruption-related-to-covid-spending/story-Zeqg6kS9Pf8TpL7GX8ZUKL.html

The regulations prohibited any public gatherings, including religious services, at the time the video was made.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-video-removed-for-anti-hindu-slur-in-south-africa/story-TUy02jibMxpZAim4cMJLUM.html

The meeting appeared to be the first sign of high-level cooperation between Tedros and the Trump administration since the president said he was cutting ties.“We had a very good discussion with the secretary as of last week and he assured me of U.S. continued commitment to support in the fight especially against Ebola,” Tedros said.The WHO said on Monday 12 people had been infected with Ebola in the outbreak of the deadly disease in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Tedros said the meeting with Azar did not mean the WHO was receiving money directly from Washington, until now its top donor.“It’s not about the money. The relationship (with the United States) is more important,” he said.It is not clear when Trump’s decision on cutting ties will come into effect and the WHO has not confirmed receiving official notification of withdrawal.Trump has accused the WHO of issuing bad advice on the coronavirus and pandering to China, where the pandemic was first reported. The WHO has defended its handling of the crisis.Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s emergencies programme, said on Wednesday there were equipment shortages for fighting the coronavirus in some regions including Central and South America.Asked about a Harvard Medical School study using satellite images that suggested the coronavirus might have been spreading in China in August 2019, he urged caution.“It’s really important that we don’t speculate too much,” he told the virtual briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-hopes-to-work-with-us-on-ebola-despite-donald-trump-s-criticism-on-covid-19/story-n28hHir2YFbqIZT6cAzkMK.html

The Gurdwara Sri Guru Singh Sabha is located on Havelock Road in Southall, which has long had a significant presence of people of Indian origin. Its MP, senior Labour leader Virendra Sharma, welcomed the council’s decision.He said: “I welcome the decision by Ealing Council to finally rename Havelock Road - decolonising our streets. As the Member of Parliament for Ealing Southall and a councillor for 25 years before that I have often been ashamed the names of empire still pervade our streets”.“I have long campaigned for schools to teach more about our Imperial past, not just the great strides made but also the shameful thuggery and violence, names like Havelock belong in books, classrooms and museums, not on the streets to be celebrated”.“The community should come together to decide how we rename this road, but celebrating Guru Nanak Dev Ji in his 550th anniversary, and erasing a white man who killed Sikhs, Muslims and Hindus, would be a sign of our multiculturalism and our diversity,” he added.London mayor Sadiq Khan (Labour) this week called for a review of statues and other public spaces in the capital following growing protests in the UK linked to the killing of George Floyd in the US. Some statues of individuals historically linked to slave trade have been removed.Julian Bell, leader of the Labour-controlled Ealing council, said in a video message to residents that he welcomed Khan’s plans to look at how public spaces in London represent the city in the present day.He said: “Our diversity is our strength and we need to make sure that our public realm, our statues, our road names, our buildings, reflect our diversity and do not reflect a frozen past where colonialism, racism and the slave trade were present and celebrated.”“Havelock Road is where the largest Sikh gurdwara in western Europe is cited and as part of its 550-year celebrations of the birth of Guru Nanak this year, we want to make this name change to Havelock Road to Guru Nanak Road”.“This will symbolise the huge contribution of our Sikh community in Ealing and also diversity as a borough, and also it will represent our unity as a borough too,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-protests-london-s-southall-road-to-be-renamed-guru-nanak-road/story-GpxRE9Wv1zjHgYsAdfJ3OO.html
