Although she was abandoned in a remote area after being raped, the woman managed to note down the license plate number of the trailer truck and report the crime. The driver, Vikas Singh, tried to evade Panvel police, but after a chase that lasted almost an hour, Singh was arrested on Wednesday morning. The 18-year-old had come to Mumbai on Sunday, from Mahuvadi village in Uttar Pradesh by a Shramik Special train. Her husband is a labourer and lives in Pune. The couple were married seven months ago. “The woman could not meet her husband for over four months due to the lockdown so they planned to meet in Pune and settle there. She reached Mumbai on Sunday and stayed with a relative who suggested she travel to Kalyan and then to Panvel by bus, from where she was told any vehicle would give her a lift to Pune,” said an officer from Panvel police station.On Tuesday afternoon, the woman reached Kalyan by a local train and took a bus to Panvel. At around 12.30am on Wednesday, she reached Kalamboli junction and around 1.15am, Singh, 35, offered her a lift in the trailer truck he was driving. However, instead of taking her to Pune, he parked the vehicle at a T-point in Uran and despite the 18-year-old’s attempts to fight him off by biting him, Singh raped her. Afterwards, Singh abandoned her and left with the trailer truck. “The place was remote, but the woman showed presence of mind and noted the trailer’s number on her mobile. She also dialled 100, informed the officer on duty of her predicament and gave her location at around 2.30am,” said the police officer. A police team, including a woman officer, reached the spot soon after and took the woman to a hospital. The woman told the crime branch team the details of the crime and the license plate number that she’d noted down. Police inspector Sunil Tarmale said, “Around 3.30 am, we got the number of the trailer and decided to look for it in Western Railway’s warehouse area where trailers are parked for the night.” The police found Singh in his trailer truck, but he tried to evade arrest. “When we asked him to come down, he started the trailer and escaped. We followed him for over 45 minutes. At Palaspe Phata, he took an under-construction bridge by mistake and had to stop mid-way. He left the vehicle and tried to run, but we caught him,” said Tarmale. A case against Singh has registered under section 376 (rape) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/18-year-old-heading-to-pune-raped-by-trailer-driver-in-mumbai/story-0VTwzx4lDqv4d3zcj1JkXK.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Coastal road reclamation may harm coral patch at Haji Ali’||Marine experts have raised an alarm about the ongoing reclamation activity along the south Mumbai coastline for the coastal road project. Less than 400 metres from the work site near Haji Ali dargah is a 10-metre patch of false pillow corals. Corals are a schedule I species under the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972 and could suffer damage if they aren’t translocated from the area.On Wednesday, reclamation work using an excavator machine was being carried out at one end of the path leading to Haji Ali dargah. Co-founder of Coastal Conservation Foundation, Shaunak Modi said the corals are located to the left of this path while work is being done on the right side. “This is the largest patch of reef-building false pillow corals (Pseudosiderastrea tayamai) we have found along the Mumbai shoreline. The only other location where we have found these corals is in Cuffe Parade, but that is a very small patch,” said Modi.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said all coral patches fell outside proposed reclamation zones. “We are aware of the presence of coral patches at two locations in Haji Ali. Both these areas are beyond our proposed reclamation zones and will not be touched,” said Vijay Nighot, chief engineer, BMC’s coastal road project.Last year, the Bombay high court (HC) had appointed a committee and directed BMC to obtain permissions under the WPA, before commencing work on the coastal road project, owing to the presence of corals. “The committee recently submitted a proposal to our divisional forest office (mangrove cell),” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (mangrove cell). “It is yet to be cleared by my office, the chief wildlife warden, and then the state. Thus, until such time that the proposal is cleared, any reclamation of corals is a violation under WPA.”The current 9.9-km phase of the coastal road project, proposed at Rs 12,969 crore, will connect Marine Drive to the southern end of the Bandra-Worli Sea Link. HT had reported last year that eight species of corals are under threat from the proposed construction, according to environment group Vanashakti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/coastal-road-reclamation-may-harm-coral-patch-at-haji-ali/story-pRumnYaQ6iED9RBxZap7xL.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Need more anti-viral drugs and ventilators in Maha, CM tells PM||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, while on Wednesday thanking Prime Minister Narendra Modi for the resumption of local train services for frontline workers in Mumbai, demanded more ventilators and drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab for the effective treatment of Covid-19 patients.Thackeray, who participated in the sixth video conference on the Covid-19 pandemic with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, requested the latter for these drugs at reasonable prices. He said that the state has an adequate stock of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and N-95 masks, but it needs more ventilators, especially for rural areas.State health minister Rajesh Tope said, “We have demanded supply of remdesivir and tocilizumab by the Centre at reasonable prices. We have been administering these drugs to some patients on compassionate grounds with permission from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). We have requested that the Centre make them available for all patients at reasonable prices. We have also demanded for the supply of 500 ventilators for Mumbai and other parts of the state. Maharashtra has adequate number of other beds, but we lag in ICU beds with ventilators.”Thackeray apprised the PM with the steps taken by the state government in its fight against the Covid-19 pandemic and also told him how Maharashtra has struck a balance between the lockdown norms and rolling out economic activities. The Maharashtra CM also said that its “chase the virus” policy has helped in containing the spread in many hotspots, including Dharavi in Mumbai. He also said that Maharashtra has set up facilities with a cumulative strength of 3 lakh beds to treat Covid-19 patients and has robust infrastructure of 282 dedicated Covid hospitals, 434 dedicated Covid health centres and 1631 dedicated Covid centres.PM Modi said during the VC that the reports about the re-imposition of the lockdown were rumours and the government would speak only about unlocking (the lockdown). PM said though crowding and violation of the lockdown was a serious problem, the country has successfully fought against the pandemic. He said the high recovery rate was the result of the collective efforts.The CM told Modi that 60,000 industrial units in the state have gone operational with 15 lakh workers reporting back to the work. He said that 5.15 lakh workers are working under the employment guarantee scheme on a daily-wages basis. “Maharashtra government has decided to promote students from non-professional courses on the basis of their grades in the previous terms as conducting exams in the near future was not possible for us. Centre should take a cautious and uniform decision related to the exams of professional and non-professional courses,” Thackeray said in the conference. He also has demanded for the Centre’s intervention in crop loans by nationalised banks. He has sought an extension of three months to Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Yojana in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/need-more-anti-viral-drugs-and-ventilators-in-maha-cm-tells-pm/story-jDGBghZQbRkYhOCEzOJVBI.html

CBI has also booked unknown public servants and bank officials, and is conducting an inquiry against them.Cases have been registered against two Mumbai-based firms — Avyaan Overseas Private Limited (now known as M/s Bagla Overseas Private Limited), Mumbai and its managing director Mohit Kamboj and directors Jitendra Gulshan Kapoor, Siddhant Bagla, Irtesh Mishra, and another firm named KBJ Hotels Goa Private Limited.According to a CBI official, between 2013 and 2018, Avyaan Overseas Pvt Ltd (now known as M/s Bagla Overseas Pvt Ltd) and its managing director Mohit Kamboj along with unknown public servants with the intention to cheat entered the Bank of India Mid Corporate Branch, Fort in the mater of FB Purchase/Foreign Bills Negotiation Limit and Export Packaging Credit Limit. The company allegedly got sanctioned and released the said facilities to the tune of ₹60 crore (approx.).After availing the said limits, the accused company diverted the funds and prepared forged and fabricated documents in support of the claim owing to which the bank suffered loss to the tune of ₹57.26 crore, stated a CBI press release.CBI conducted searches at five places in Mumbai including residential and official premises of the accused including private companies.

17-06-2020||Mumbai||Over 100 days after first Covid case, Maha tally reaches 1,16,752; toll 5,651||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case count reached 1,16,752 after it recorded 3,307 cases on Wednesday. Of them, 51,921 are active cases, according to the state health department. The state on Wednesday reported 114 deaths, taking the toll to 5,651. Of them, 77 are in Mumbai, 21 in Pune, seven in Jalgaon, two each in Malegaon, Latur and Nandurbar and one each in Mira Bhayandar, Pimpri-Chinchwad and Yavatmal.Mumbai, the worst-hit city across the country, recorded 1,359 cases as its case count reached 61,587. Of them, 26,997 are active cases. The city toll stands at 3,244. On May 22, Mumbai reported its highest one-day increase in cases — 1,751.Wednesday was the eighth day fresh cases breached the 3,000 mark in the state. The state has reported over 2,000 cases daily for more than a month. The highest single-day spike was 3,607 reported on June 11.From the first case on March 9 to 1,16,752 on June 17 — the past 101 days saw Maharashtra fight a tough battle against Covid-19, as it has been the worst-hit state in the country. NO PEAK YET?Data shows the state is getting more than 2,000 cases daily since May 17, when the number of fresh cases breached the 2,000-mark for the first time. Soon, another grim milestone of 3,000 cases a day was crossed — May 24 (3,041 cases), June 7 (3,007), June 10 (3,254), June 11 (3,607), June 12 (3,493), June 13 (3,427) and June 14 (3,390). In the past 31 days (from May 17), the state has recorded 86,216 cases, an average of 2,694 cases a day.By the end of May, the state has successfully brought down the case fatality rate to 3.26% from 7.41% (with 148 deaths) on April 13. But it has started rising again. On Tuesday, it jumped to 4.8% from 3.7% (on Monday) as 1,409 deaths were added to its toll. This includes reconciliation of 1,328 past fatalities and 81 deaths reported in the previous 24 hours.The highest single-day toll was recorded on June 15 (178 deaths). The state health department, however, clarified that 29 of the total deaths were recorded in the past two days, while the rest were past fatalities.Since May 17, the state has also recorded 4,516 deaths till Wednesday. It also includes reconciliation of past 1,328 fatalities declared by the health department on Tuesday. On an average, it comes to 141 deaths a day.State health minister Rajesh Tope recently predicted the decline is likely to start from the end of this month, but also stressed he was going by the trend in other countries. Officials, however, while they have got mathematical predictions, models of other countries and expert opinions, it is tough to tell when the situation will be brought under control.CAUSE FOR CONCERNAmong the prime concerns is the rising case fatality rate (CFR), which touched 4.84% on Wednesday. On Wednesday, the country’s death toll went up to 11,903. The state’s toll stood at 5,651, which means 47.47% of the total deaths in the country were registered in Maharashtra alone. “The number of cases will continue to rise over the next 15-20 days as the peak has started. The decline is likely to start from the end of June. I’m saying this going by what is happening in other countries. The situation in the state will stabilise soon,” Tope had said on June 14.“We don’t know the time-frame by which we will be in a position to say the situation is under control. We also don’t know by when the actual decline will start. In fact, no country can tell that. What we do have is mathematical predictions, models of other countries and expert opinions. So far, all mathematical predictions have failed. We are closely monitoring development of other countries,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean, KEM Hospital, Mumbai, said, “Dedicated hospitals for Covid treatment have the highest fatalities because they have the most critical patients with different co-morbidities. We saw patients with existing co-morbidities got uncontrolled diabetes because of stress during lockdown period, although they were taking medicines regularly. Probably, this is one of the reasons behind the rise in fatality rate.”State health department is also having no plans to start using dexamethasone, a cheap and widely used steroid, that has become the first drug to be able to save the lives of Covid-19 patients, according to trial results in UK. Dr Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, health department said they are already using Methylprednisolone since last three months. “Methylprednisolone is also an steroid and is giving good result, while Dexamethasone is not yet incorporated in the Centre’s protocol. Also, we have consulted AIIMS doctors and they have informed that it is unlikely to have an effect different from Methylprednisolone,” Dr Vyas saidTrial results announced by the University of Oxford on Tuesday showed dexamethasone, which is used to reduce inflammation in other diseases such as arthritis, reduced death rates by around a third among Covid-19 patients on ventilators and by a fifth for those on oxygen.The constant improvement in the recovery rate has brought big relief for the state. On Wednesday, it reached 50.68%, from 31.05% on May 27.It has also completed 7 lakh tests so far. The health department declared to have conducted 7,00,954 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 5,84,202 people tested negative, said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-100-days-after-first-covid-case-maha-tally-reaches-1-16-752-toll-5-651/story-lan8Smuor35b3ihapu8uIK.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Illegal wildlife trade racket busted; 19 held||A major crackdown by the Maharashtra forest department led to the arrest of 19 people involved in illegal wildlife trade spread across the districts of Nashik, Thane, Pune, and Ahmednagar.The Wildlife Crime Control Bureau (WCCB) said this was the largest crackdown witnessed in the state over the past 10 years. Wildlife articles included two red sand boas (Eryx johnii), protected under schedule IV of the Wildlife Protection Act (WPA), 1972, and one Indian soft-shell turtle, protected under schedule I of WPA.Between June 1 and 11, the forest department arrested two police officers, Vishwas Chavankhe, an assistant police inspector from Rabale police station in Navi Mumbai, Thane district, and Deepak Dhabekar, a constable from Chatushringi police station in Pune. An information technology (IT) entrepreneur from Pune and a real estate agent also from Belapur were also arrested for playing the role of middlemen, said forest officials.Around 20 forest officials, mainly from the Nashik (East) forest department, carried out the operation starting from Yeola, a town in Nashik, on June 1, where local Somnath Pawar was arrested while trying to sell a live red sand boa. The remaining wildlife articles were seized on June 7 when a trap was laid for one of the accused Nikhil Gaikwad in Ahmednagar district and the soft-shell turtle was recovered. Six others were arrested on June 11 in Sinnar, Nashik, while trying to sell the second red sand boa. Two four-wheelers and one bike were seized from the accused during the operation.“Rather than just stopping at the first seizure and arrest, we investigated the entire route of persons involved in this racket, right from the source to middlemen and finally the end seller. The entire operation, followed by court proceedings, took around two weeks,” said Tushar Chavan, deputy conservator of forest (Nashik East). “We began by tapping the source in Nashik district where the first person was arrested. After getting forest custody, a step-by-step process helped us identify other culprits within the district,” he said.The forest department sought assistance from WCCB and the Maharashtra cyber cell. “After making the first six to seven arrests, we tracked down the middlemen using call record data, geo-location of the persons, and continuous interrogation of the arrested accused,” said Chavan adding, “The middlemen across major cities were the ones calling the shots for the trade, and they were the most difficult to track down. Remaining persons were either carriers or sellers. They were easily nabbed by setting up traps where forest officials acted as interested buyers or dummy traders near railways stations, bus stands, and markets.”All 19 people were granted magistrate custody till June 22 by a district court in Nashik. “We have not assigned any value for the wildlife articles seized because it is unethical to do so, and further enhances their trade. Any reports suggesting any value are false,” said Chavan.The list of accused and suspected persons in the investigation was submitted to WCCB.M Maranko, regional deputy director WCCB (West), said, “A string of these many arrests followed by detailed detection by the forest department has not been witnessed over the past decade. In most cases, we observe that the basic seizure and arrests are made, and the case ends. But the state forest department was able to uncover all loopholes in this one.”Maranko added that WCCB will now be taking over the matter to check whether the arrested accused were part of a pan-India nexus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/illegal-wildlife-trade-racket-busted-19-held/story-nwScdGG4YmLsjQ0L0cB2DO.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||MU looks to reopen campuses||Even with little clarity on final-year examinations, University of Mumbai (MU) has started working towards partly reopening its campuses soon. Through links sent across to all their employees, MU is currently gathering data on the residence of those who work at Fort and Kalina campuses to find out what kind of transportation the university will have to arrange to bring them to start work. Employees, however, are worried about getting back to work on a campus which has recently been used as a quarantine facility by the government.“We received a Google form this week, where the university has asked about the status of our health and that of our family’s, as well as residential details. We believe they are trying to arrange for buses and other forms of transport for us to and from work,” said a varsity employee on condition of anonymity. In March this year, as the state and city were grappling with increasing Covid-19 cases, MU had offered to turn a hostel and the IT Park in their Kalina campus as a quarantine facility. Most employees are worried about sanitisation of the area before calling people to join work.An official from MU, however, confirmed that no one will be allowed back to the campus for work before ensuring that the campus is sanitised and ready for use. “As of now we are only collecting data to find out how transportation will work, to pick up and drop our employees back at their doorstep. Only once we clear these points will we start daily functioning of the university,” said an official.In the past few months, MU has also started working on virtual education and not only did most affiliated colleges finish their syllabus by conducting virtual classes, but MU also managed to conduct viva for engineering students online.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mu-looks-to-reopen-campuses/story-85pbnNWbIlyWUweTRWzTMO.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Won’t take action against staff over reconciliation of toll, says BMC chief||No action – a show-cause notice or a first information report (FIR) – will be taken against Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, hospitals, and doctors over discrepancies in the Covid-19 toll figures, which led to reconciliation, civic chief IS Chahal said on Wednesday. A total of 862 deaths were added to Mumbai’s toll on Tuesday, after reconciling the numbers, which Chahal said will be a recurring process over the next one month.“Of the 862 deaths added to Mumbai’s cumulative Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday after reconciling the figures, 750 were reported to the civic body after June 10. How can I blame my officers? They did not lie. Action will not be taken against hospitals and deans either because the hospitals will collapse. I will not take action against BMC officials,” said Chahal.On Tuesday, the state added 1,328 deaths to the toll, of which 862 are from Mumbai. The numbers took the city’s toll to 3,167 on Tuesday and pushed up the fatality rate to 5.2% from 3.79%. The city’s case count was 61,587 and toll 3,244 on Wednesday.Maharashtra’s leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis demanded action against those responsible, alleging a cover-up. After the figures were released on Tuesday, he tweeted: “It is my sincere request to the state government that please don’t ignore this entire episode of criminal negligence in the name of reconciliation of numbers.” “These figures were suppressed for last 3 months. We demand strict action against all those who are responsible for this,” he wrote.However, Chahal denied any lapses in the process. He said, “It is a statistical lapse. The inward entry for 750 of the 862 deaths at BMC level is after June 10.”Chahal also said on June 8, BMC told all hospitals to report deaths within 48 hours, following Government of India’s rules. A BMC circular dated June 8 was sent to all municipal and private hospitals, making it mandatory to send all information of deaths within 48 hours to Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s epidemiology cell, which uploads it to the Government of India’s portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/won-t-take-action-against-staff-over-reconciliation-of-toll-says-bmc-chief/story-x4FT3d0olkfdXzgWiVlbuJ.html

It has started acquisition process online so that farmers and the authority staff are able to keep themselves safe from the Covid-19 infection. The process to buy land is being done online via portal- www.investgnida.in, officials said.“We have decided to buy the land directly from farmers so that we can acquire, develop and allot it to entrepreneurs, who want to set up units, invest and generate employment in the region. Generating employment and boosting economy are crucial to revive the economy,” Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer, Greater Noida authority, said.On November 29, 2019, the authority had decided to buy 1,500 acres as a direct purchase from farmers who are willing to sell their land for industrial projects and other schemes. However, the authority could not carry out the buying even after it was approved during its 116th board meeting for various technical reasons. “We are buying the land through mutual consent. The farmers who want to give their land can do so by visiting our portal. Apart from selling their land, they can also get all the work related to the land acquisition done via this portal,” Deep Chand, additional CEO, Greater Noida authority, said.Farmers also can get their issues related to residential plots, court disputes, hiked land compensation and leaseback resolved via this portal. “We start an electronic file of a farmer and process the cases,” Chand said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/to-create-jobs-greater-noida-begins-land-acquisition-for-industrial-use/story-cTQauzMo3ubumAsqJeTnuI.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||BMC wants to give Remdesivir to 1K patients a month||To bring down the city’s Covid-19 fatality rate of 5.2%, which has seen a steady rise in the past two weeks, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) wants to administer Remdesivir, a drug used to treat Ebola, to at least 1,000 patients a month.Municipal commissioner IS Chahal said he would make the request at the video conference between state governments and Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday, before the meet. At the conference, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray requested the prime minister to expedite permissions to use three drugs to treat Covid-19 positive patients, including Remdesivir. “Let me give it to 1,000 patients a month. Remdesivir has proved very effective and its use will help Mumbai considerably bring down its fatality rate. I also want it to be easily available at cheap rates, to be administered to poor patients, who cannot easily afford it. Today, it is not available. In fact I am mentioning let the drug be available at every chemist. Let common man have access to it. This is one way of saving lives. Currently, the drug costs ₹1,60,000 per patient.” The increase in Mumbai’s fatality rate over the past two weeks has been a cause for concern for BMC. The rate stood at 3.2% on June 1, and rose to 3.7% by June 15. However, after the state government reconciled death figures on Tuesday, adding 862 deaths to Mumbai’s cumulative toll, the mortality has gone up to 5.2%.Remdesivir has been approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to be used for Covid-19 patients on compassionate grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-wants-to-give-remdesivir-to-1k-patients-a-month/story-VwgJk3x7Gor5oGOL4pJ8KL.html
17-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Covid-positive body stuck in limbo for 24 hrs as electric furnace develops snag||Ghaziabad: It took 24 hours for the cremation of a 58-year-old man’s body at an electric furnace at the Hindon cremation ground, as the facility developed a technical snag on Tuesday. The furnace could be repaired only on Wednesday afternoon, officials of the Ghaziabad municipal corporation (GMC) said. Officials of the GMC, which operates the crematorium, said that the body was partially burnt when the furnace developed snag. It took around 24 hours for the snag to be repaired, after which the cremation process was completed on Wednesday, they said, adding that a body takes about one hour to one-and-a-half hours to be burnt to ashes.The family of the man from Indirapuram, who died of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease, said the body was taken to the Hindon cremation ground Tuesday morning.“The body was placed inside an electric furnace around 11.30am on Tuesday and we were asked to come in the evening to collect the ashes. When we went there in the evening, the caretakers told us that there had been a malfunction and the body was still inside. We were shocked,” the victim’s son said.“We approached corporation and district officials to get it repaired, and waited for almost an entire day on Wednesday when the rest of the last rites was completed after repairs,” the son said.GMC officials said that the crematorium has only one chamber instead of a general practice of two chambers.“The furnace developed a technical snag when the cremation was being taken up. About 10-15% of the process of the last rites were pending when the malfunction took place. When the issue came to our knowledge, we got it repaired and made it operational by 3pm on Wednesday. There was hardly anything we could do about it as the crematorium has only one chamber,”said Manoj Prabhat, GMC’s executive engineer.“There was a technical snag related to a drain pipe about 10 days ago, and cremation of bodies had got hampered back then also. The electric crematorium has to run with continuous power supply and we have to shut it down for about two days in order to cool it down so that repairs can be taken up. So, we are now trying to improve technology and run it on CNG supply instead of electricity,” Prabhat said.Senior MCG officials said that the crematorium, which was handed over to them by the Ghaziabad Development Authority (GDA), became operational in May.“We are now trying to expand the facility at the crematorium and it will be done with the corporation’s funds. The GDA has said that they don’t have funds. So, we will get it upgraded from our own funds,” said Dinesh Chandra, municipal commissioner, Ghaziabad.Santosh Kumar Rai, secretary of GDA, said that the crematorium was constructed by an agency and handed over to the corporation for operations. “The incident is unfortunate. At the time of handover to MCG, no one pointed out any shortcoming. Had the corporation pointed out, we would have got it upgraded then,” Rai said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-covid-positive-body-stuck-in-limbo-for-24-hrs-as-electric-furnace-develops-snag/story-hZSZ3HkfBMHZhRbYDoVKCO.html

17-06-2020||Mumbai||Very sorry state of affairs: HC on Covid-19 tests in Maharashtra prisons||A division bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday expressed displeasure over the lack of Covid-19 testing of prisoners in Maharashtra.The bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice KK Tated accepted the argument advanced on behalf the public interest litigation (PIL) petitioner, Mumbai chapter of the People’s Union of Civil Liberties (PUCL) – the largest and the oldest human rights organisation in India – that the number of tests on inmates of correctional homes across Maharashtra was abysmally low. The court noted that the state needed to adopt corrective measures.“The report of the ADG (prisons) reveals a very sorry state of affairs,” said the bench, commenting on a report submitted by the additional director general (ADG) of police (prisons) revealing statistical information about the prevalence of Covid-19 in prisons across Maharashtra and steps taken to contain the spread of the contagion in jails.ADG Sunil Ramanand in his report to the HC had submitted that prion authorities had conducted 17,695 screenings of inmates and jail staff since the Covid-19 outbreak. After the screenings, swab tests were conducted for 1,681 inmates and staff, of which 269 inmates and 73 jail staff tested positive for the Covid-19 virus.The judges were annoyed to note that at least four under-trial prisoners died in prisons and swab samples collected after their death revealed that the deceased were suffering from Covid-19.PUCL had moved HC, complaining that there was a complete lack of transparency as regards the condition of prisoners and preparation of prisons to deal with a calamity like Covid-19, which has resulted in panic and concern amongst the community, family members of prisoners, and their lawyers. The petitioner sought orders to provide information regarding the health and Covid-19 status of inmates to their family members and advocates on record.It also sought directions to ensure that inmates have ample access to face masks, hand sanitiser, soap, and cleaning supplies at no cost. Maintaining that prisoners should enjoy the same standards of healthcare that are available to the outside community, the petitioner body prayed for a report from prison authorities detailing measures taken for prevention and control of the spread of Covid-19 in prisons.Noting that the ADG (prison) also stated that there was no sufficient space to quarantine prisoners who have tested positive for Covid-19, the court has now asked advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni to appear in the matter. It has also requested state authorities to ask district collectors concerned to identify suitable space for quarantining prisoners.The bench has also called for details such as the capacity of prisons to house under-trial prisoners, actual number of such prisoners lodged in jails across Maharashtra, number of inmates who have crossed the age of 60 years, etc.The PIL will come up for further hearing on June 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/very-sorry-state-of-affairs-hc-on-covid-19-tests-in-maharashtra-prisons/story-7ovxQVf5TFkNv2P58m2GUJ.html
17-06-2020||City||For pregnant women, an arduous journey to get Covid test done||Raj Kumar, a resident of Arthala near Mohan Nagar, had to take his eight-month pregnant wife in a cab to the sampling centre at IMS College, Dasna, despite Sanjay Nagar hospital being closer.The reason: Ghaziabad district’s only major sampling centre has been relocated to Dasna, which is on the city’s outskirts, spelling trouble for all pregnant women who have to get their sampling for Covid-19 done mandatorily. The sampling centre till about a fortnight ago was operating out of Sanjay Nagar hospital. It was shifted out to Dasna after the Sanjay Nagar health hub was declared an L2 category dedicated Covid hospital last month.“We had so far been consulting a private doctor in Sahibabad for her treatment. The doctor advised us to get a Covid-19 test done, so we came to the sampling centre at Dasna. It is very hard to travel in scorching heat and not at all possible if you do not hire a cab. It is about 16km away from my house. A number of pregnant women, I am told, can be spotted standing in queue for hours daily to get their sampling done, before delivery,” Kumar said.“Although my wife has no symptoms but the doctor told us that a Covid test is mandatory before she delivers. We came here on Wednesday noon and waited for over an hour to get her sampling done. We found that about 15 other women were in queue with us. It is very difficult for women to come here in peak summer and get their tests done after a long wait,” he added.Bijender Kumar, a native of Chappraula in nearby Gautam Budh Nagar, also came with his wife on a bike but the couple had to return soon.“My wife initially stood in the queue, but when her turn came she was denied sampling. The staff at the sampling centre said that we are from Gautam Budh Nagar and we should get our sampling done there itself and not in Ghaziabad. We were surprised but had no option and returned home. My wife had symptoms of fever and cough,” he added.However, when asked, not many knew that a sample testing facility for pregnant women had been started at Women’ Hospital which is in the same complex at MMG District Hospital.“We started testing on May 21 and it was initially for one hour. Thereafter from June 2 , we initiated another round of sampling, which is now done from 8am to 7pm. . In all we have taken up 172 samples of pregnant women till date and four of them have tested positive so far,” said Dr Deepa Tyagi, chief medical superintendent of women’s hospital.“We are not denying sampling to any pregnant women who come to us even from neighbouring districts, like Gautam Budh Nagar. In all we are carrying out 10-12 deliveries daily with all precautions assuming that every patient may be Covid-19 positive. Since March 22, we have done 780 deliveries and another 215 C-sections.We generally advise pregnant women in advanced stages of pregnancy to get their Covid-19 tests done in order to avoid any complications during deliveries,” she added.The chief medical superintendent on Wednesday also said that she had opted to go in home isolation after she got exposed to at least three women at the hospital who tested positive on June 16.The hospital complex is also being sanitized.The district health department officials on the other hand confirmed that they have one sampling centre at Dasna and another 12 mobile vans, which take up sampling in different areas.“It is possible that pregnant women do not have the required information that sampling can also be done at women’s hospital, which is in Ghaziabad city. So, they need not come to the sampling centre at Dasna,” said GK Mishra, district malaria officer.In another move, the district malaria officer also de-sealed four highrises in Kaushambi about two days after they were sealed. The members of Kaushambi Apartments’ RWA (KARWA) said that the health department officials asked them to submit records of all patients.“Initially they came to seal four towers on Monday. They de-sealed them on Wednesday . There have been two deaths and several positive casest. When we asked, they asked us to bring the record of patients otherwise they will not take up sealing in future. We told them that we do not have access to patient records and they must get it themselves even if the patients are in Delhi,” said VK Mittal, president of KARWA.According to UP government’s latest directions, the residential towers are to be sealed for 14 days instead of 21 days directed earlier.“The RWA gave us verbal information and did not provide us records. In case anyone objects to sealing then we might have got caught in legal issues. Since families of patients had tested negative and some families were not present in Kaushambi, we decided to de-seal the towers on Wednesday,” Mishra said....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-pregnant-women-an-arduous-journey-to-get-covid-test-done/story-dxrVqhNWnFfR01xfCp9eDJ.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Jobs for sons of soil: MMRDA ad seeks 16K labourers||Following chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s call to provide employment to ‘locals’ at Metro and other infrastructure sites, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has released a requirement list of 16,726 workers at its sites. This includes a requirement of 7,459 unskilled labourers, 2,678 carpenters, 423 welders, 274 masons, 3,725 fitters and 2,167 electricians across sites. Those who do not have the required qualification will also be given free training for a month, MMRDA stated. Thackeray had asked MMRDA to provide employment to the “bhoomiputras” after a large number of migrant workers left the city in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. In an advertisement released on June 15, MMRDA stated that those interested should get in touch with the respective contractors, whose number have been published on the website. A senior official from MMRDA, who did not wish to be named, said, “This is to explore and provide employment to people even from the interiors of the state. We will train them with the required skill sets.”The works include eight Metro lines, a sea-link and several under-construction flyovers in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Two of the Metro lines, which were supposed to be operational from December 2020, are now likely to be functional only by March-April 2021. MMRDA hands over phase-2 of Covid hospital at BKCMMRDA on Wednesday handed over phase-2 of the Covid-19 hospital constructed in Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray virtually inaugurated the phase-2 of the hospital in BKC as well as a Covid hospital in Thane. Phase-2 has 970 beds and was constructed in 17 days. Phase-1, built at a cost of ₹19 crore, was handed over to BMC in May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jobs-for-sons-of-soil-mmrda-ad-seeks-16k-labourers/story-N2HWK3FpHlIQIOKNeAvbcN.html

The man tested positive just four days after his marriage, though his wife has tested negative.The accused, a resident of Sakhri village in Mokhada taluka, got married on June 11, and on the eve of the wedding, on 10 June, he had arranged a prenuptial party, which more than 70 people had attended. The man had not taken permission from the police patil (village head) or the tehsildar of Jawhar and did not maintain social distance the next day at the wedding, which was attended by 80 persons.Hence, an FIR was registered against the accused under section 188 (disobedience) and 269 (spread of infection) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), Epidemic Diseases Act, 1897, and Disaster Management Act, 2005. No arrest has been made yet as the accused is being treated for Covid-19.“Due to the man’s infection and lack of social distancing during his wedding celebrations, the villages of Kelghar (where the wedding took place), Pipurna, Dongachi Mait, Navapada, Gorwadi, Jambhulvihir, and Sakhri have been declared as containment zones and around 144 people who had come in contact with the couple are in quarantine,” said a government official.Meanwhile, in Palghar district, 2,164 positive cases and 71 deaths have been reported to date, said an official from the district information office, Palghar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fir-against-man-for-spreading-covid-19-in-jawhar-during-his-wedding/story-r4papb0WeJyM4VdgRcm1GJ.html
17-06-2020||City||Keep ‘safe’ distance: An autorickshaw that sanitises passengers||A mechanic and an autorickshaw driver have designed five rickshaws that have everything you need for a safe commute during the pandemic. Each vehicle has a separated compartment for driver and commuter, hand sanitisers, sanitiser sprays and accepts only digital payment.Gafoor Shaikh, 32, runs a garage in Kalyan. With his childhood friend, autorickshaw driver Janardhan Vishe, 38, he redesigned the interior of the autorickshaw so that it has all the precautions needed to prevent the spread of Covid-19. With the lockdown in place, Vishe couldn’t ply his autorickshaw. “He could not work and he was worried. I gave him an idea to make the auto safer and use it for emergency services,” said Shaikh.Shaikh and Vishe’s redesigned autorickshaws are fitted with hand sanitisers as well as an automatic sanitiser spray which sanitises passengers once they’re inside. “We also regularly sanitise the auto before a passenger boards or leaves. If more such autos are introduced it will be beneficial for both auto drivers and passengers,” Vishe said.To prevent physical contact between the driver and the commuter, Shaikh and Vishe have added a plastic partition between the driver’s compartment and the commuter’s seat as well as a digital payment system. “We have displayed our mobile numbers and also the QR code for e-payment. We won’t accept cash,” said Vishe.Vishe started using his redesigned autorickshaw for emergency services in May. Since then, Shaikh and Vishe have given four more autorickshaws this makeover and they are being used for emergency services.Deputy regional transport officer, Sanjay Sasane said, “As per the state government’s directions, only those autos that are plying for emergencies shall be allowed on streets. Some auto drivers have transformed their autos into safer ones, which is appreciable as it helps send a clear message of the precautions to be followed.”Residents also welcomed Shaikh and Vishe’s redesign. “With ambulance services not up to the mark in the city, there should be more autorickshaws allowed for medical emergencies. The authority can take forward such ideas and allow more autos on the streets for the convenience of both passengers and auto drivers,” said Rambaug resident Amit Joshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/keep-safe-distance-an-autorickshaw-that-sanitises-passengers/story-b2OdMoG2mHTIjWbHNmJv2L.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Cancer survivor moves HC as Customs dept withholds imported feeding tubes||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday issued notice to the Customs commissioner of Mumbai after a cancer survivor filed a petition complaining that his feeding tubes imported from the USA have been withheld by customs authorities.The Mumbai resident in his petition stated that in December 2016 he was diagnosed with oral cancer and due to remedial surgical operations his intake of food is only possible through feeding tubes. He added that the feeding tubes are not available in India and need to be imported from the USA as there is no alternative available.Given the situation, he said, he imports necessary feeding tubes from the USA and maintains a stock. He said since his stock was depleted, he imported four boxes of the feeding tubes labelled ‘Osmolite Nutrio N-Food for Tube Feeding Patient’ from the USA through a courier, but the assistant commissioner of customs, Air Cargo Complex at Sahar in Andheri, has withheld the packets “on grounds which are unclear to the petitioner”.The man moved the high court on Tuesday for urgent relief contending that he had a limited stock available with him which will last only a few days.Acting on his plea, the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice NR Borkar has issued notice to the customs authorities asking them to remain present in court either personally or through their lawyer and explain “the difficulty in releasing the packets containing feeding tubes.”The court has posted the petition for hearing on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cancer-survivor-moves-hc-as-customs-dept-withholds-imported-feeding-tubes/story-L5XHZmx0iVzRHAVzONM8NK.html

He said in the initial phase, this survey will be conducted in NCR, hotspots and high-risk areas. Among them, priority will be given to screening of doctors, nursing staff, paramedical staff, police and other frontline workers of NCR districts. Haryana Medical Services Corporation MD Dr Saket Kumar said the entire cost of testing will be borne by the government. “The test kit has been developed by ICMR-National Institute of Virology, Pune and is completely indigenous.

Since GTB Hospital was designated to treat only Covid-19 patients, the patients were asked to go approach other hospitals for transfusion.“We had a tough time, as we had to first look for a hospital which would do the transfusion and then go to GTB Hospital to collect blood. I had to go to a private hospital to get the transfusion done. I hope things will streamline now,” said Soman Madan (32) who has been undergoing blood transfusion treatment at GTB Hospital since 1999.On June 15, HT had highlighted the problems faced by the patients after GTB Hospital and Lok Nayak Hospitals were declared Covid-19 facilities.In the order, the two units have been asked to shift along with the staff.A doctor at DSCI said, “We have not received the order as yet. Once we get it, we will start the process to make arrangements for it. It will take a few days to put the system in place.” JS Arora, general secretary of the National Thalassemia Welfare Society, said, “It is a good move by the government and would benefit a lot of patients. We hope the units are made operational at the earliest.”Of the 13 government hospitals offering thalassemia care in the Capital, three—Lok Nayak, GTB and Hindu Rao (on June 14)—were declared as designated Covid-19 hospitals. Shobha Tuli, secretary of Thalassemics India, said, “We welcome this decision by the government. We also want similar measures to be taken at Hindu Rao and Lok Nayak, which are designated Covid facilities. Patients there are also having a tough time getting the treatment.”A senior Delhi government official said that no decision on Hindu Rao and Lok Nayak hospitals has been taken so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gtb-hospital-told-to-shift-thalassemia-unit-in-relief-to-patients-needing-transfusion/story-lzKvNiWLPz8BwM5qW9uDUJ.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Social distancing in trains, buses a challenge||With the increase in passengers travelling by local trains, social distancing inside the compartments appeared to be going for a toss on Wednesday. According to railways, approximately 75,000 passengers travelled on Central and Western Railway on Wednesday. Western Railway (WR) saw 40,000 commuters and Central Railway (CR) 35,000. Despite the railways permitting 700 passengers in one local train with approximately 58 in one compartment, instances of crowding, standing near the footboard were reported on Wednesday. Instances of flouting social-distancing norms inside Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses were also noticed. BEST, which began operation on June 8, ferried 5.9 lakh passengers in 2,657 buses on Wednesday. Passengers took to social media to complain about violation of social distancing norms inside train compartments. “@CMOMaharashtra Sir see the condition. Images received on WhatsApp. Current local train Mumbai Dadar to Kalyan Government employees. So just think if private company employee start traveling What will be the situation (sic),” tweeted @rudra7679.CR responded by urging passengers to maintain social distancing norms. “We appeal to passengers travelling inside local trains to maintain social distancing inside local train compartments,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, CR. Senior railway officials stated crowding inside local trains would reduce if the state government staggers office timings and introduces e-pass for essential employees.“Introduction of staggering office timings was already asked by railways in order to maintain social distancing. It has not yet been implemented, that is why queues outside railway stations and passengers standing inside local train compartments are being noticed. E-passes will also help streamline passengers, it should be introduced soon,” said a senior CR official.CR conducts training for motormenCentral Railway conducted online training of 247 of its motormen during the lockdown. The training, conducted over 21 days, had three online modules created by motormen training institute in Kurla. The modules also included practical training for three motormen in one batch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/social-distancing-in-trains-buses-a-challenge/story-pWWX5N29eK3WVaFt9M5iiK.html

The city now has 4,189 total cases. Five deaths were also reported on Wednesday, taking toll to 129. 102 patients were also discharged.Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) commissioner Annasaheb Misal claimed the increase is due to the mass screening camps held across the city to identify positive cases, and said there is no need to panic. Misal said, “The rise in the cases is due to the relaxation of lockdown norms and also the mass screening camps held by NMMC. So far, 30,276 people have been screened. There is no need to panic as these camps are helping to curb the spread of the disease by identifying the patients early.”He further added, “Those with mild symptoms or asymptomatic people do not go for tests, which could lead to such people passing on the virus to others. We have identified many of them through our camps that we are holding especially in slum areas, lower income group areas and densely populated areas.”Assuring that the civic body is geared up to battle Covid, he said, “We have arranged 7,000 beds in the city for Covid positive patients. Hence, there is no question of non-availability of beds. Medicines and other consumables, too, are in adequate supply. We are also recruiting additional medical manpower through walk-in-interviews.”“The new 1,200-bed Covid care centre plus Covid health centre at Vashi Exhibition Centre is equipped with 500 beds with oxygen facility. There are also ventilators, dialysis and x-ray facility for Covid patients. A 25 to 30-bed ICU facility is being set up and we are expecting 20 ventilators from the state government,” Misal said.On the issue of testing, the civic chief said, “With the help of CSR, we are getting 19,000 tests for free. A testing lab is also being set up at Vashi NMMC Hospital while we have already got a machine from the government which is helping us test 25 people each day. There are adequate facilities for non-Covid patients too at our Nerul, Airoli, and Turbhe hospitals which are being upgraded with medicine and surgical departments.”An official from NMMC said, “Of the 128 new cases, 27 are from Kopar Khairne, 22 from Turbhe and 17 are from Vashi. Of the new positive patients, 15 are children with the youngest being a 2-year-old girl in Juhugaon and another 2-year-old boy from Vashigaon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rise-in-covid-19-cases-due-to-mass-screening-says-nmmc-chief/story-hKyt2yI4REdttlVlYr0jVI.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Tope: Won’t allow pvt hospitals to admit asymptomatic patients||After deciding to reserve 80% of beds at private hospitals in Mumbai for Covid patients, the Maharashtra government on Wednesday said that they will not allow these hospitals to admit asymptomatic patients as it will be unfair to patients in serious need of oxygen support.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that they will appoint a designated officer for each private hospital and all admissions will be routed through them.“We have found that private hospitals are giving admissions to asymptomatic Covid positive patients. This is a sort of injustice to severe patients as they will need oxygen and ventilator support. We have decided to appoint a designated officer for every private hospital,” Tope said.To deal with the shortage of beds for Covid-19 patients, the state government on May 22 decided to reserve 80% of the beds at all private hospitals in the city for those infected with the coronavirus.The health minister also informed that they have introduced a new slab of ₹2,500 for Covid testing. “It will be applicable for those who choose to go to a private laboratory for testing and pick up their own reports,” he said.The state had recently capped the Covid testing price at private laboratories to ₹2,200 and ₹2,800. The laboratories can charge up to ₹2,800 in case the services like swab collection and delivery reports are given at home. Labs can charge ₹2,200 if swab collection and delivery reports at done from hospitals.Tope also asked Mumbaiites to dial 1916 or ward control room to get free ambulance services. “We have decided to keep five to 10 ambulances in every ward of the city. People can take benefit from the service free. Do not go for private ambulances as we have made available 500 ambulances for the city. Very soon, an addition of 150 more ambulances will be made to the current strength,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tope-won-t-allow-pvt-hospitals-to-admit-asymptomatic-patients/story-xRa7MdbA0V2B8iYrgZbnpL.html
17-06-2020||Delhi||North body doctors defer mass resignations, to get two months’ salaries by June 24||The resident doctors of North Delhi Municipal Corporation’s Kasturba Gandhi Hospital and Hindu Rao Hospital have deferred their decision to tender mass resignations over the late payment of salaries till June 24. The decision came after the north corporation, on the court’s intervention, agreed to pay two months’ salaries on June 19 and June 24. The doctors of both hospitals had said they had not been getting salaries for the last three and four months, respectively. “We have decided to wait till June 24 as north corporation leaders have assured us of disbursing two months’ salaries on June 19 and June 24. If they fail to give us our salaries within the new time frame, we will tender mass resignations as planned before. We are fighting the coronavirus disease pandemic, yet not being paid regularly,” Sunil Kumar, president, Resident Doctors’ Association, Kasturba Gandhi Hospital, said.Doctors of Kasturba Gandhi Hospital had said on June 10 that they were not paid their salaries since March 2020, making them unable to pay their house rent, bear travel expenses and buy essential commodities. They had threatened to resign from June 16 if their salaries were not paid. Kasturba Gandhi Hospital is a 450-bedded maternity and child speciality hospital near Jama Masjid.Similarly, on June 11, resident doctors of Hindu Rao Hospital had threatened mass resignations from June 18 over unpaid salaries for the last four months . They have also decided to defer their decision till June 25.Abhimanyu Sardana, president, Resident Doctors’ Association, Hindu Rao Hospital, said, “After the high court’s direction, the North DMC has said they will pay our two months’ salaries on June 19 and June 24.” He said apart from releasing salaries, the corporation should ensure that delays do not take place in future. Hindu Rao Hospital doctors have not been paid salaries since February 2020. There are around 250 resident doctors at the hospital, north corporation’s largest with 980 beds. It has now been converted into a Covid facility.According to civic officials, the north corporation employs around 1,000 senior doctors, 500 resident doctors, and 1,500 nursing officers across its four hospitals. Avtar Singh, mayor, north corporation, said, “Court directions will be followed. We are making arrangements to release salaries. We have demanded ₹1,500 crore from the Delhi government, which we are yet to get.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-body-doctors-defer-mass-resignations-to-get-two-months-salaries-by-june-24/story-4PJvecVf8thMMfkrMH4TeJ.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Medical exams may be held in August: MUHS||Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) on Wednesday announced that medical examinations are likely to be held in August and that students would have the option of choosing an examination centre closer to their homes instead of their college. The decision by MUHS will be applicable to around 24,000 medical and dental students in the state. The news has, however, not gone down well with students, most of whom are currently volunteering at different hospitals treating Covid-19 patients.In a statement released on Wednesday, MUHS said summer 2020 examination is proposed to be held in August this year. “For the written and practical exams, if students want to change their examination centre to a college of their choice that is nearest to their current location, this will be made available,” said the statement. “However, the principal/dean of the college where the student is studying should get documents from such students to certify the hometown/location of the parents where the student has requested to appear for the exam,” it added.According to the MUHS circular, students will have to compete the application process by June 24.This decision comes less than a week after students approached MUHS seeking cancellation of the exams. They also sought an extension of the ₹5-lakh Covid insurance to students expected to appear for their exams from colleges that are currently treating Covid-19 patients. The university has taken up this matter with the state government.“Most of us are currently working on field or in hospitals with Covid-19 relief work and are witnessing the situation first hand. If we have to give examinations from these same hospitals and colleges, the state should cover our insurances as we don’t want to put ours or the lives of our families in danger,” said a student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/medical-exams-may-be-held-in-august-muhs/story-DZj4b0sADwZj3bmeFZhvCM.html

17-06-2020||Mumbai||Still being forced by schools to pay hiked fees, allege parents||Even as the state education department has issued a series of regulations to ensure that parents get flexibility in paying schools fees, several schools in the city are still not playing by the rules, said parents. The Maharashtra Navnirman Vidyarthi Sena (MNVS) wrote to the department on behalf of several parents on Wednesday urging officials to act against schools which are not complying with government norms. “Several schools are forcing parents to pay hiked fees while many others are asking them to physically come and pick up stationery and other material from the school which is compulsory. In a crisis situation like this, schools are blackmailing parents. Despite complaints, no action is taken against them,” said Chetan Pednekar, vice-president, MNVS. “Many schools are also violating the standard operating procedures set by the department and are conducting classes for hours together,” he added. A senior official from the education department said, “We are taking action against such schools. Parents need not worry.” When asked about the nature of action taken, the official refused to comment on the issue.Another set of parents from a school chain in Goregaon wrote to the education department on Tuesday demanding action against a school which had hiked its fee by 8%-10%. Parents said that despite their complaints to nodal officers appointed by the department, no action has been taken against the school. “The school told us now that parents who do not pay their complete fees would not get education kits for their children. We just hope the government acts soon,” said a parent on the condition of anonymity. According to a government resolution released in the first week of May, schools cannot hike fees for the academic year 2020-21 and have to allow parents to pay fees in instalments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/still-being-forced-by-schools-to-pay-hiked-fees-allege-parents/story-xITYmWRbO2cW5AXQdNQqCM.html
17-06-2020||City||Man jumps to death, day after wife returns home after beating Covid-19||Gurugram: A 45-year-old man allegedly jumped to death from the fourth floor of his apartment in a condominium in Sector 37-D on early Wednesday morning, a day after his wife was discharged from hospital after undergoing treatment for Covid-19, said the police.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (crime), said that the deceased’s wife had tested positive on June 9 and was admitted to a private hospital. She was discharged after a week on Tuesday and had returned home, he said. “Around 3.40am, the man went out of his bedroom and allegedly jumped from the bedroom window,” Sangwan said, adding that the police did not recover any suicide note and are investigating the matter.According to the police, doctors had advised the family to remain under home quarantine, and as per the protocol the man’s swabs had been collected and results were awaited. Sangwan said that his first sample had tested negative for the virus, but he was still in panic. “His sample was collected again on Tuesday. He had not discussed any issues or problems with his family, apart from the coronavirus pandemic. As per preliminary investigation, he ended his own life fearing that he might have got infected,” he said.The police official said that the wife told the investigating officer that her husband was restless all night. “Later she was informed by the security supervisor that he had fallen from the window,” said Sangwan. The post mortem of the deceased will be conducted once his relatives will reach the city, said the police.There have been at least five cases in the city in which people have allegedly ended their own lives after being tested positive for Covid-19 or a family member getting infected, the police said.Virender Yadav, chief medical officer (CMO), said that if any patient or their family members have any sort of anxiety, they should meet senior clinical psychologists. “The recovery rate in coronavirus cases is indicative of the fact that more than half of positive cases have recovered from the disease,” he said. Of 3,682 Covid-19 cases in Gurugram till June 16, 1,915 patients have been discharged after being cured, health department data shows.To help people overcome any anxiety related to the coronavirus disease, the district mental health team has started counselling Covid-19 patients, their family members and at least two of their neighbouring households in urban clusters.Dr Vinay Saini, a psychiatrist in the district health team, said that the government has launched a helpline 1075 for people dealing with anxiety or depression. “This disease is curable and people should reach out to doctors, family members and friends if they are feeling low. Such people should avoid spending time on social media platforms during this phase as there are a lot of rumours and fake news in circulation,” he said, adding that the helpline is open from 9am to 7pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-jumps-to-death-day-after-wife-returns-home-after-beating-covid-19/story-kFjOZtZuvHWR7mlZ1xB2AK.html
17-06-2020||City||Over 90% govt school students connected to classes remotely: Education dept survey||Gurugram: Around 90% of government school students in Gurugram district now have remote access to online lessons through various mediums, according to a survey carried out by the department of education. This is a significant improvement from a month ago when the survey was initiated, when only around 60% were aware of or were taking part in distant learning initiatives via WhatsApp or televised programmes, department officials said.The survey was started in May to familiarise students with remote learning processes during the lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, and monitor their progress, especially those students who did not have access to technology. As part of the ongoing-survey different education officers, from school principals to block-level officers, reached out to families on a daily basis to find out if students are facing any hurdles in remote learning.Officials handling the survey said that easing of lockdown restrictions had played a role in bridging the gap between students and remote lessons. With the easing of restrictions, students who did not have smartphones were able to reach out to friends and family for sharing of resources, said officials.“When we started over a month ago, only around 60% of students were aware of remote lessons that were taking place. Our recent assessment has shown that around 90% of the students surveyed daily are aware of remote lessons and are connected with distant learning in some way or another,” said Ravinder Alawadhi, deputy director, State Council of Educational Research and Training (SCERT) and the survey in-charge.SCERT officials are conducting the survey on behalf of the education department. Alawadhi said teachers were connected to students, be it via WhatsApp or phone calls, due to which a regular learning momentum was being maintained. “Students who don’t have smartphones or television sets receive daily calls from teachers and are kept in the loop about homework. Even if they are taking lessons through television broadcasts, teachers call and inform them about the homework that needs to be done,” he said.He added that the easing of lockdown restrictions had enabled students to step out and reach out to classmates and relatives from whom they could share notes and status of the day’s class work. “If children don’t have smartphones at home, they are able to go out and obtain resources from neighbours. Earlier, with the lockdown in place, this was not possible as people were confined within their homes,” said Alawadhi, adding that the survey would continue for now. District education officer Indu Boken couldn’t be reached for a comment.Suman Sharma, principal of Government Model Senior Secondary School in Sector 4/7, Urban Estate, said that the school was in touch with a good number of students with teachers apprising them about daily lesson updates. “Most students are getting lessons through WhatsApp. For those who don’t have smartphones, we are advising that they tune in via television. On a daily basis, we call a fixed number of students and share the homework for the day with them,” said Sharma.Lalit Kumar, a painter, whose daughters study in a government school, said that accessing lessons was a challenge for families like his in the absence of a phone and television set. Kumar’s daughters, however, borrow smartphones from relatives to catch up on lessons occasionally. “Lessons are not taking place as before. There is disruption. Officials have asked my daughters to watch lessons on TV but we don’t have one. My daughters try to exchange notes with friends, whenever there’s a chance,” said Kumar.While the department estimates that more children are gradually being covered through remote lessons, volunteers who are working on the ground with students of government schools said that challenges remained due to the digital divide.Viren Jain, a class 11 student of a private school carrying out a volunteer-driven programme as part of which government schoolchildren are taught over the phone, said that remote learning was challenging for many students. “Online classes have been very limited. Some of the active teachers have been doing it. But there are students who are in need of additional support, due to lack of resources. Many of them have gone back to their native places and are no longer taking any classes due to the absence of internet and smartphones,” said Jain.He added that many children being taught under this initiative had dropped out due to accessibility issues. “With their families moving, some students dropped out. For others, finding the right time for teaching is a challenge. Most of these children come from families where there is only one phone at home, which needs to be shared with others,” said Jain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-90-govt-school-students-connected-to-classes-remotely-education-dept-survey/story-sr4aUQX6Am3ZBJ9yiiyadJ.html
17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Railway employees above 55 asked to avoid field duties, take precautionary measures in Ludhiana||After a 51-year-old senior railway official of the northern railway division died of coronavirus at the Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) here on Tuesday afternoon, the railway station authorities here have asked employees above 55 to avoid field duties and asked them to take all precautionary measures to save themselves while on duty at the station.The authorities said staffers have already been provided with masks, sanitisers and personal protection equipment (PPE) kits as per the requirement of duty.A visit to the railway station at 2pm revealed that two employees have been deputed for thermal screening near the reservation booking counter and any passenger, with higher temperature, is not allowed to board the train.Police have also been deployed at the foot overbridge so that the passengers, de-boarding trains at platforms 2 to 5 can be screened by officials of the health department before they move out of the station from the Civil Lines side. The authorities have also restricted the use of lifts and escalators at the station.As many as nine pairs of trains are halting at the station daily.Station director Tarun Kumar confirmed, “All the employees above 55 have been asked to avoid field duties and take all precautionary measures against coronavirus while on duty at the station. We will receive more PPE kits soon and these will be given to the ticket checking staff.”Divisional railway manager (DRM), Ferozepur division, Rakesh Aggarwal, was not available for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-railway-employees-above-55-asked-to-avoid-field-duties-take-precautionary-measures-in-ludhiana/story-dFVXhcJevL0NohwxXvGs9N.html
17-06-2020||City||Autos pack passengers, flout social distancing rules||Gurugram: Autorickshaw drivers are seen flouting social distancing norms and ferrying passengers more than the permissible limit, risking the potential spread of coronavirus disease as cases spike in the city. In quite a few areas, CNG autorickshaws can be seen ferrying up to four passengers, violating the guidelines and posing a health hazard. Compounding the problem are the overcrowded diesel autorickshaws, a preferred mode of transport, which accommodate as many as 10 passengers on a sharing basis.Last month, the Haryana government had issued guidelines, capping the number of passengers allowed to travel in autorickshaws in the state. According to the guidelines, excluding the driver, autorickshaws can carry two passengers. All drivers and passengers must cover their faces with a mask or cloth and regularly use hand sanitisers. At Rajiv Chowk on Tuesday morning, a group of six factory workers got into a shared autorickshaw to Manesar, each negotiating a fare of Rs 20 for the ride. The driver, Jai Prakash Sahu, a native of Rajasthan, said, “For the initial few days, I was limiting the number of passengers for each trip due to the fear of infection. But I cannot afford to do so anymore. I have to pay Rs 400 rent daily for the auto, plus the expense for fuel. If I follow the norms, I would not earn enough to cover the cost.”Shravan Kumar, a passenger, said, “I know crowding in a shared auto is a concern. But I shall have to pay Rs 100 for a commute to Manesar in a CNG auto. It is not economical for me to do so every day. To protect myself, I wear a mask and hope for the best.”Since the lockdown was eased on May 17, the autorickshaws have slowly returned to the roads. According to an estimate by the Haryana Auto Chalak Sanghatan, before the outbreak of the coronavirus disease, anywhere between 25,000 and 30,000 autos were plying in the district on a daily basis and at least one-third of those drivers returned to their native states during the lockdown. Apart from the drivers affiliated with private cab aggregators, many of whom have installed plastic sheets as a precaution, the independent autorickshaws are operating with scant regard for social distancing norms and guidelines. Lalit Kumar, an auto driver in Kanhai village, said, “The business has gone down substantially. When the police are not around, I do not refuse any trips even if I have to accommodate a passenger on the front seat. I am earning Rs 300 a day after all the expenses, so I cannot limit passengers. If a family of three approaches for a trip, I will not say only two of you can board.”Police officials said they were issuing challans and booking people under relevant sections of Indian Penal Code and Disaster Management Act. Chander Mohan, deputy commissioner of traffic (DCP), east, “Several challans have been issued and autorickshaws have been impounded for violating social distancing norms. Traffic police officials have been directed to take strict action in such cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/autos-pack-passengers-flout-social-distancing-rules/story-y0fE2NPeOXfMvy8LFPBRvM.html
17-06-2020||City||Gurugram: HSVP to resume auctions for residential plots from next month||Gurugram: In a welcome move, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) is likely to restart the auction of residential plots from the middle of next month. The HSVP Gurugram has asked the three estate officers – two in the city and one in Rewari – to share details of plots in estate office 1 and 2 and Rewari, which are without any encumbrance and can be handed over to buyers. A committee has also been formulated by the authority, to be headed by Jitender Yadav, the HSVP Gurugram administrator, which shall scrutinise these plots and approve for auction. It is expected that around 120 plots would be put for auction initially.The authority stopped the online auction of residential plots two years ago due to legal issues and now plans to restart the process so that land available for sale can be monetised. Officials said the authority would also give an opportunity to home buyers to get plots in HSVP sectors across the city. “I have asked the estate officers to initially submit a list of 40 plots each from their zones, which are clear of all encumbrances, so that the auction can be carried out. This will enable the authority to monetise its land which is presently not yielding any revenue, and also give an option to homebuyers to buy plots in a fair manner,” said Yadav. Once the list of plots is submitted, a committee comprising HSVP officials, and DTP, Gurugram headed by the administrator, will verify the details of these plots and do onsite verification of the locations to ensure that legal titles are clear and properties are ready to be handed over to buyers. “We don’t want a situation where a buyer has paid the money but the plot in question is undergoing some legal issue and the handover gets stuck,” said Yadav.Further, the administrator has asked officials to prepare a detailed list of all the residential plots owned by HSVP in three estates so that these can be physically verified and put on subsequent online auctions in coming months.The authority has faced an acute financial crisis in the past two years on account of large cash outflows, which were paid as enhancements to land owners. It has also taken large loans from banks to pay this money and is trying to monetise its land assets and manage the cash crunch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-hsvp-to-resume-auctions-for-residential-plots-from-next-month/story-2sopJv1H7gCrYQ7NVWqBIP.html
17-06-2020||City||Gurugram: To improve contact tracing, HSVP to deploy staff at high-risk health centres||Gurugram: To ensure that data and information collection through contact tracing becomes more effective and in real time, the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) on Wednesday decided it will deploy one employee of the authority at those public health centres (PHCs) where the number of coronavirus (Covid0-19) cases is high. A team of HSVP officials also visited four PHCs and interacted with health department staff to gather more information on the nuances of the process and fine tune the system, the authority said.“We have decided that an employee of the HSVP engaged in contact tracing would remain present at the PHCs where the number of cases has been high to improve coordination, boost assistance and collect real time data. Our team went to a number of health centres and interacted with medical officers and health employees to know what problems they face and if there is need for more support from our side,” said Jitender Yadav, HSVP, adding that their focus is on checking the spread of Covid in high risk zones and that this is possible by improving contact tracing.The team visited PHCs located in Sukhrali, Patel Nagar, Rajiv Nagar and Wazirabad and held detailed discussions on improving the process of documentation, sharing information and coordination to ensure minimum defects in contact tracing, and reaching out to the last contact, said officials. The HSVP, in collaboration with health department officials, has been engaged in contact tracing of Covid-19 patients and is supporting the rapid response teams as well as PHCs in urban areas since the past two weeks.The authority is coordinating with 36 public health centres in urban areas of the city in this regard. “The team asked about the details in contact forms and checked about positive patients with medical officers and found that PHCs at Wazirabad and Sukhrali are doing good work. We need to work more in Sukhrali and Patel Nagar and try to standardise the practice in all PHCs in urban areas,” said Yadav. HSVP has been given the task of contact tracing, supporting RRTs and getting high risk patients tested by the district administration after a reshuffle was carried out two weeks earlier. Last week, the health department had said that seven clusters in the city have been identified as hotspots as half of the cases have been reported from there. These include Firoz Gandhi colony, Wazirabad, Lakshman Vihar, Chanderlok, Dundahera, Chakkarpur and Gandhi Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-to-improve-contact-tracing-hsvp-to-deploy-staff-at-high-risk-heath-centres/story-qaAuKatOWHgyK7fTOs1CsJ.html

Police told the court that this was done to “preserve the communal harmony” because if these FIRs were put online it would disclose the names of the complainant, witnesses and accused persons.The submissions were given by the police in reply to a bunch of petitions filed by CPM leader Brinda Karat in March, seeking copies of the FIRs related to the riots should be uploaded on the website of the Delhi police. On Wednesday, the Delhi High Court heard Karat’s plea but did not pass any order and adjourned the matter for hearing on July 15.All FIRs except those in crimes against women and others categorised as sensitive are uploaded on the police’s website. The pleas had also sought directions that copies of FIR, remand application, orders of remand, grounds of arrest and charge sheets to be supplied through e-mail/ whatsapp/ post to the families and counsel of accused persons.It had also sought that a status report on the investigation and asked police to disclose the names and numbers of persons detained and arrested by the probe agency in relation to the violence. Replying to the pleas, the city police, through a status report, submitted before the court that, “A conscious decision has been taken to declare the FIRs connected to riots as sensitive. This has been done to primarily preserve the communal harmony as putting these in public domain would disclose the names of the complainant, witnesses and accused persons.”Opposing the demand to disclose the name and numbers of persons detained and arrested, police said that Karat is not an accused, complainant or even a witnesses in any of the 751 cases registered in connection to the riots that broke out in North-East Delhi in February. The riots had claimed over 50 lives and left more than 400 people injured.“Disclosing the names of the person arrested/detained during the period of investigation would prejudice the rights of the accused. The petitioner (Karat) has no locus standi in the criminal matter. Hence, the list of persons detained or arrested by Delhi police since March 24 is being provided in a sealed cover for the perusal of the court,” the police status report said.The petition has also urged the court to direct that “all complaints alleging acts, offences and atrocities by members of the police, Rapid Action Force or state functionaries in relation to the widespread attacks in northeast Delhi be investigated by an independent investigating agency/team”.The Delhi police’s special cell had named at least seven persons including Ishrat Jahan, Khalid Saifi, Safoora Zargar, Gufisha Fatima, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Tahir Hussain in its charge sheet for conspiracy leading to the riots. The students groups, activists and their counsels have denied the charges and accused police of launching a witch hunt against students and anti-CAA protesters. Police have said that some anti CAA protesters had planned the riots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/firs-in-n-e-delhi-riots-sensitive-can-t-be-put-online-delhi-police-tell-hc/story-rrS0J8Z59w7EJyq4et7pBK.html
17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Fee regulatory body: Centre can modify Punjab laws adopted in Chandigarh, HC informed||The central government on Wednesday told the Punjab and Haryana high court that it was competent to make any modifications in a Punjab law being adopted by Chandigarh.The response was submitted in a plea filed by a private schools’ association challenging UT’s order asking schools to upload balance sheets on their websites. The Independent Schools’ Association has also challenged constitution of the Fee Regulatory Authority, under the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, that was adopted by UT in 2018. The association has argued that the body has been constituted in violation of the parent law.On Wednesday, the Centre’s counsel told the court , “Section 87 of Punjab Re-Organisation Act, 1966, empowers the central government to extend enactments to Chandigarh with such restrictions or modifications as it thinks fit by notification in the official gazette.” The Centre argued that even otherwise, the notification will reveal that the modifications have been carried to incorporate transparency and maintain non-commercialisation of the unaided educational institutions. The additions are merely clarificatory, the court was told.The UT administration has already told the court that disclosure of income and expenditure of schools on their websites doesn’t amount to invasion of their privacy and will not be violation of any rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The administration has termed these schools “public entities”, as they have been established on government land, and argued that they are bound to follow directions issued by the administration from time to time with regards to fee regulation.The litigation started as UT sought schools’ income and expenditure details, as parents complained of schools resorting to profiteering even during the Covid-19 lockdown. The details were to be examined by the fee regulatory body, constituted under the law in question. Schools have challenged the body’s constitution as well as provisions, which make it obligatory for them to upload their income details. The matter stands adjourned for June 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fee-regulatory-body-centre-can-modify-punjab-laws-adopted-in-chandigarh-hc-informed/story-EVtFYihrhcaiI1eW1oWWQM.html

National Independent School Alliance (NISA) president Kulbhushan Sharma during a press conference in Chandigarh on Wednesday said, “The state government is unfair on private schools by issuing baseless and illegal orders, due to which the existence of private schools is in danger,” he said, demanding that their staff must be accommodated in the state-run schools if the government was mulling closing private schools.He also sought a relief package for the parents who were unable to pay fees. The government must deposit Rs 3,000 in the accounts of such parents, Sharma said.The Haryana government had on Monday said that the school leaving certificate was no longer mandatory to take admission in the government schools, which evoked a sharp response from private schools.“The latest orders of the government have created a crisis which will ruin the future of students as well as endanger the livelihood of the teachers and staff of private schools. The government, instead of providing any relief, has been continuously imposing arbitrary rules,” Sharma rued.He said the chief minister and education minister must clear their stand on the situation. “If the government is against private schools, it should bring an ordinance to close these schools. There are 6 lakh teachers and non-teaching staffers working in such schools. The government should accommodate them, otherwise the private school operators will launch an agitation,” he added.“A demand to withdraw the order has also been made to CM Manohar Lal Khattar and the matter has also been put in the high court,” the NISA chief said.Integrated Private School Welfare Society, another private schools’ body based out of Ambala, has also sought the rollback of the order. Its president Sourabh Kapoor said, “In such a situation, instead of helping private schools, the government is conspiring and pushing them to the verge of closure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/school-leaving-certificate-pvt-schools-seek-rollback-of-haryana-govt-s-order/story-nXf9AeKup3c2rPOclKi9YM.html
17-06-2020||City||Two thieves posing as migrants held for robbing man’s wallet, withdrawing at least ₹25k cash||New Delhi: A 26-year-old man helped track down two thieves who allegedly stole his wallet and withdrew cash from ATMs in Delhi by posing as people who needed to return to Bihar but had no money for fare, the police said on Wednesday.The victim responded quickly when the suspects used his debit card to make purchases from a shop in Rohini.According to Monika Bhardwaj, deputy commissioner of police (Rohini), the victim used the SMS he received after the transaction to call the shopkeeper and ensure the suspects did not leave the shop.“In the meantime, we sought the help of the local police in Rohini to nab the suspects,” said the DCP.The victim, Manish Kumar, works for a private firm in Noida and lives in Jahangirpuri. On Tuesday evening, he was waiting for a bus at Kashmere Gate bus terminal when a teenager approached him and sought help to get to his village near Patna in Bihar.Kumar helped him with water and ₹100 cash and asked him to catch a train rather than look for a bus. “But amidst the conversation, the minor’s accomplice managed to steal Kumar’s wallet containing ₹4,500 cash and his debit card. The wallet also had his PIN,” the DCP said.When Manish couldn’t chase the suspects because of a traffic jam, he called the police. “Minutes after the theft, the suspects first withdrew ₹20,000 from one ATM and then ₹5,000 from another ATM. When Kumar received SMS’ of the withdrawals, we quickly sent our police teams to both the booths, but they had escaped by then,” said the DCP.But Kumar was lucky the third time the suspects used his card to transact — this time they allegedly purchased 10 pants from a shop in Rohini.“The arrested adult is 22-year-old Jalaluddin, a resident of Bawana,” said the DCP, adding that his antecedents are being verified. The minor was also apprehended.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-thieves-posing-as-migrants-held-for-robbing-man-s-wallet-withdrawing-at-least-25k-cash/story-FHymbuYv6vZ4HqZGC6ZUgK.html
17-06-2020||City||Burglary at Ashok Vihar church, second incident in less than two months||New Delhi: Burglars broke into St. Jude Thaddeus Church in north Delhi’s Ashok Vihar near Gulabi Bagh, ransacked the religious structure, and decamped with valuables worth around R3 lakh in the intervening night of Sunday and Monday, police said. This is the second burglary in the same church in less than two months. The church authorities have alleged police inaction and the police’s failure to nab the suspects in the first case, which they claimed led to the second incident. “Separate first information reports (FIRs) have been registered in connection with the two burglary incidents. But, the police have not been able to nab the thieves,” said Father Noby Kalachira, the chief priest of St. Jude Thaddeus Church. The first burglary took place in the intervening night of April 18 and 19, when the lockdown was imposed across the country to stem the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The church was locked because religious activities and gatherings were banned in religious establishments as per the government’s lockdown guidelines. According to Father Kalachira, the thieves entered the church after breaking the exhaust fan installed at the ventilator. They ransacked the church and took away all valuables, which could pass through the ventilator space. “The stolen items included 12 microphones, amplifiers with speakers, a monitor displaying the CCTV footage and a vacuum cleaner. The office of the church was also ransacked and the offering box was also broken,” the church authorities said in a statement, adding, that a case was registered but neither the suspects were caught nor the stolen items were recovered. During the inspection of the church, Father Kalachira said, the police brought to their notice that the four CCTV cameras installed in the church were not functioning between 7pm and 7am. “We got the issued rectified the same day. However, it made no difference to the thieves as a second burglary took place in the intervening night of June 14 and 15,” he said. This time, Father Kalachira said, the thieves took a more daring step and entered the church through a window after cutting its iron grill. They again ransacked the church and decamped with many valuable items, including gold and silver Cross and things used for Holy Mass such as chalices, patens, ciboriums and kappas, said Father Kalachira. “The thieves also took away the digital recorder in which the footage of the CCTV cameras was stored. The new monitor, which was installed after the first one was stolen, is also gone,” he added. Deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said that separate cases were registered in the two burglary incidents. “Teams have been formed to identify and nab the thieves. Our probe is on,” she said.Investigators suspect that somebody living in the neighbourhood could be involved in the two burglaries. “The burglars knew that the issues with the CCTVs were rectified after the first burglary and the cameras were functioning properly. This is why they took away the digital video recorder,” said an investigator, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/burglary-at-ashok-vihar-church-second-incident-in-less-than-two-months/story-hhIyj7lqISeF89SmvFtf5I.html

The man who shot at the guard, however, is still at large and senior police officers said that raids were on to nab him, senior police officers privy to the case said.On May 31, the guard, Hari Nath, was present at the main gate of the farmhouse of the Republican Party of India’s leader, Mohammad Shakeel Saifi, when a man arrived and asked about Saifi’s whereabouts. When the guard asked the suspect to contact his employer on his mobile phone, the suspect fired two rounds at him. Nath suffered bullet injuries on his legs and the attacker fled. A case was registered and the investigation was taken up by the Nihal Vihar police.Another police officer, who is aware of the developments in the case, said that after the firing incident police security cover was provided to Saifi, who had been seeking for it for the past few months.Multiple calls and text messages sent to Safi on his two cellphone numbers by HT got no response.Saifi—the national president of the minority cell of RPI— was at his farmhouse with his family when the firing took place around 9 am. RPI is led by Ramdas Athawale, the Union minister of state for social justice and empowerment.During the probe, the officer said, the investigating team identified and nabbed the three men, who were in touch with the attacker. “The motorcycle used by the attacker in the crime was provided to him by Siddiqui. The CCTV cameras were also tampered with before the crime and it all led us to probe a conspiracy angle,” said the officer.Deputy commissioner of police (outer) A Koan refused to share details regarding the arrests and developments in the case by saying, “We are yet to complete the probe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/three-arrested-for-firing-at-rpi-leader-s-farmhouse-in-delhi/story-L0hbD4R6fUgU38J6d6Py9J.html

17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Mohindra orders inquiry into use of Tarn Taran trust funds for works at Anil Joshi’s village||Local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra on Wednesday initiated an inquiry into diversion of ₹ 82.2 lakh from Tarn Taran improvement trust for development works in the then local bodies minister Anil Joshi’s ancestral village, Sanghe, during the previous Akali-BJP regime in 2015. Mohindra said the funds were diverted at the behest of Joshi in violation of the provisions of Punjab Town Improvement Trust Act -922, according to which money meant for urban development can’t be spent in rural area. “Those found in the wrong on duty will face action,” he said. Joshi said: “Sanghe is my ancestral village and I spent funds where I was born, and grew up. It was my discretion as a minister and moral duty as resident of that village. I think, I have done no wrong.”As per details available with local bodies department, ₹ 29.4 lakh were spent on the village’s ‘firni’ (perimeter road), ₹31.5 lakh on village’s nullah and ₹21.3 lakh on an inner road.“With the orders of local bodies minister (Anil Joshi) development works were carried in the past in Sanghe village. Now, the minister has again given verbal orders to complete pending works. The agenda item has also got technical approval,” reads the official order of November 20, 2015.The inquiry was initiated two days after a move to shift ₹15 crore from Amritsar Improvement Trust to cash-strapped Patiala Improvement Trust was opposed by none other than Joshi. Mohindra had proposed the transfer of funds for development of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s and his own constituency – Patiala and Patiala-II. “How can they shift the money meant for development of the holy city to CM’s bastion,” Joshi had said on Monday.“In previous government funds meant for urban development were spent on rural works. The then (local bodies) minister (Anil Joshi) has no moral right to point a finger on the functioning of my department,” said Mohindra.‘₹27 crore diverted Patiala trust between 2008-13’ Mohindra said during the Akali-BJP government (between 2008-2013), a sum of ₹ 27 crore of Patiala Improvement Trust was diverted. “₹2 crore went to improvement trust of Malerkotla and ₹25 crore to Patiala municipal corporation. This time Patiala Improvement Trust will pay interest on ₹15 crore it proposes to take from Amritsar trust which didn’t happen earlier,” said Mohindra, adding “there is law, practice and precedence of one civic body supporting the other, but not of spending on works in rural parts”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mohindra-orders-inquiry-into-use-of-tarn-taran-trust-funds-for-works-at-anil-joshi-s-village/story-VV5SCzE5tpXxv1cqX2HymJ.html

17-06-2020||Mumbai||After negligible rain for second day, IMD downgrades rain alert for MMR for rest of week||The weather bureau’s heavy rain warnings for the city over the week turned out to be a miss. The city and suburbs recorded negligible rain during the day and only moderate overnight showers from Morning to Wednesday. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) had issued an orange alert (heavy to very heavy rain) for Mumbai, Thane and Palghar for Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday, but as days went by the warnings were downgraded. On Wednesday afternoon, IMD revised it’s prediction to only light to moderate showers for the rest of the week. “Weather models had indicated the possibility of heavy rain but owing to unfavourable wind pattern over the Mumbai region, the intensity of monsoon currents weakened,” said an IMD official. “However, the currents were much stronger over south Konkan districts that recorded heavy to very heavy rain.”Between 8.30 am and 8.30 pm Wednesday, 0.5 mm was recorded in Mumbai suburbs while 0.4 mm was recorded in south Mumbai. Between 8.30 Tuesday and 8.30 am Wednesday, the suburbs recorded 0.8 mm while 14.4 mm was recorded in south Mumbai.Independent meteorologists said there hadn’t been any proper meteorological conditions for triggering widespread heavy to very heavy rainfall in Mumbai. “The wind pattern on 16 and 17 June was influenced by a low-pressure circulation over the Arabian Sea, which triggered a lot of rainfall in Konkan, but kept clouds away from Mumbai. This is common during monsoon. However, official alerts and other weather forecasts for 16-17 June were influenced by model predictions, which are often inaccurate whenever a low-pressure circulation happens to come near Mumbai,” said Akshay Deoras, PhD researcher at the University of Reading, UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-negligible-rain-for-second-day-imd-downgrades-rain-alert-for-mmr-for-rest-of-week/story-FaNDMnHwRPKN5E1glR8JZK.html

17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana: Labourer denied aid under PMAY four years after he applied for it||The plight of a common man can be judged from the fact that a labourer, who had applied for assistance under the Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojana (PMAY) four years ago, has now received a reply from the municipal corporation (MC) that the area, Ashiyana Colony on the Jassiyan road, where his plot is situated, falls outside the MC limits.The family members held a protest outside the MC headquarters (Zone A office) on Wednesday, accusing the MC officials of harassing them and depriving them of the benefits under the scheme. The labourer claimed to have spent Rs 1 lakh on the construction of the house, as a condition to get the assistance under the yojana.A migrant labourer, Lal Jha, 40, a resident of Jassiyan road, works in a hosiery unit and had purchased a 27-yard plot expecting that the government would provide financial help for constructing the house.Father of four, including three daughters, Jha rued, “We live in a rented accommodation, and I have already spent around Rs 1 lakh on the construction of his house by mortgaging the land. But, the MC officials are now claiming that the property fall outside MC limits.”Jha said, “I applied for assistance under the scheme in 2016 and the MC officials had been harassing me since then. In January, the MC served a notice stating that we would not get any benefit if we fail to commence construction. I took a Rs 1lakh private loan by mortgaging my land for commencing construction and I am paying interest on the same.”“But, on June 9, officials informed us the land is situated outside the MC limits and we cannot avail benefit under the scheme. Earlier, I was told that I would get 1.5 lakh in three installments and we had always been making rounds of MC offices for getting the benefit under the scheme.”MC superintending engineer Tirath Bansal said, “I cannot comment on the issue before looking into the record. But, if the matter raised by the couple is genuine, then I will seek a report from the staff in this regard and the case would be taken up on priority.” Senior deputy mayor Sham Sundar Malhotra said, “The MC officials have surely failed to perform their duty in this case leading to harassment to the couple. If the land is situated outside MC limits, then why no verification was carried out when the couple had applied in 2016.”“Moreover, if the area is situated outside MC limits, then why and how a notice was served to the couple for commencing construction in January? I will take up the matter with mayor Balkar Sandhu and MC commissioner Pardeep Kumar, following which action would be taken against the guilty staff members,” Malhotra added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-labourer-denied-aid-under-pmay-four-years-after-he-applied-for-it/story-Tor4BUMlUygASxj1FzaKEI.html
17-06-2020||Lucknow||Yogi suggests uniform policy for NCR, sealing UP-Delhi border||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Wednesday suggested a uniform policy for the National Capital Region (NCR) to effectively check the spread of the Covid-19 disease there. He also favoured sealing Uttar Pradesh’s borders with Delhi to regulate the movement of traffic.Yogi Adityanath made these suggestions at a video conference that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had with chief ministers on Wednesday. It was the second day of Modi’s sixth round of consultations with chief ministers on fighting the Covid-19 pandemic.Besides Uttar Pradesh, the chief ministers of Maharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka, Gujarat, and Bihar were among those who participated in the meeting on the second day.Adityanath suggested that directives should be issued for hospitalisation of asymptomatic persons instead of sending them to home quarantine.Not admitting asymptomatic persons to hospital may lead to spread of the coronavirus disease when such persons moved from one place to another, he said. A senior officer confirmed that chief minister made the suggestion about a uniform policy for NCR. “UP’s borders with Delhi (should) be sealed and movement of traffic regulated. Asymptomatic persons (should) be treated in Covid hospitals and not sent for home quarantine,” the chief minister said at the meeting, according to the officer.The chief minister, who spoke for nearly 15 minutes at the video conference with the prime minister, said there was regular movement of people from both sides in the border districts.

17-06-2020||City||Need of the hour to register workers: Delhi HC to welfare board||New Delhi: The Delhi high court has said “it is the need of the hour” to complete the registration of construction workers, “on war footing”, so that they can be provided relief, in the wake of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The court also directed the Delhi government to ensure that sufficient number of desks or windows are provided, where workers could go and get their forms for registration or renewal of registration filled up and uploaded.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rajnish Bhatnagar expressed displeasure with the Delhi government’s Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare (BOCWW) Board over the “cumbersome” registration form, lack of assistance from the authority in filling up application forms and no specific timeline for processing the same.It also declined the Board’s contention that it does not have the money or other means needed to provide assistance to fill up and upload the applications, saying it was “their job to facilitate the same, particularly when they have devised such a cumbersome form which is not even bilingual”.“We, therefore, direct that the Board should ensure that sufficient number of desks or windows are provided, where workers could go and get their forms for registration or renewal of registration filled up and uploaded,” the bench said. It also said that help can be taken from the Delhi State Legal Services Authority’s (DSLSA) for the purpose.The directions were issued in a plea by social activist Sunil Kumar Aledia seeking registration of all construction workers in Delhi under the BOCWW Act so that they can be eligible for the monthly ₹5,000 relief the government has been giving to labourers under the ambit of the scheme.Aledia in his plea, filed through advocate Shiven Varma, has contended that only a small section out of the over 10 lakh workers in the city are registered under the laws regulating their welfare and service conditions and thus, a huge chunk of the labourers are not getting benefits actually meant for them.The bench also termed as “completely unacceptable” the Board’s stand that it cannot say with certainty the application forms would be examined.“If this state of affairs is allowed to prevail, the construction workers who are genuinely entitled to register or renew their registration would have to wait endlessly.“..whereas need of the hour is to complete the process at the earliest on a war footing so that succour could be provided to the construction workers in the wake of the pandemic,” the bench said in its order of Tuesday which was made available on Wednesday.The court said the Board should ensure it does not unduly delay the entire exercise of registration or renewal of registration, considering the “grave urgency” at present to register and renew the registrations.It said the renewal process should be simplified. It asked the Board to file an affidavit highlighting the steps taken in compliance with the court’s directions. The matter will now be heard on July 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/need-of-the-hour-to-register-workers-delhi-hc-to-welfare-board/story-i6SmCOU4e14AWonWEWeIQP.html
17-06-2020||City||Delhi HC dismisses plea seeking waiver of rent during lockdown period||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court has dismissed a plea seeking directions to waive rent payable by tenants during the Covid-19 lockdown period stating that the powers for waiving rent vests first with the landlords, who are contractually entitled. The court said that it will be “extremely slow in interfering with the contractual terms which have been entered into by the parties to the contract”.A bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan also imposed a cost of Rs 10,000 on the petitioner stating that the plea seeking a waiver of rent is “thoroughly misconceived and baseless”. The court also said that the petition was a “Publicity Interest Litigation” and not a Public Interest Litigation (PIL).“If such type of general argument is accepted by this Court, that rent should be waived for all the tenants of Delhi who are poor for the month of April or/and May or/and June, it will lead to injustice,” the bench said onTuesday, the order of which was uploaded on Wednesday.The court’s direction came while deciding a plea by a practising lawyer Gaurav Jain seeking to waive rent for the lockdown period for the tenants in the city.On March 29, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had appealed to landlords not to force tenants for one-two months for rent and accept payments in instalments if the tenant is short on money. Later on April 22, an order by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority had called for “strict compliance” of directions that landlords will not demand rent from migrant workers and students for one month. “It required for the respective district magistrates to spread awareness about this directive and, in case of non-compliance, take legal action,” the order said.However, the order is not valid in the present scenario as it was only for a month from the date of issuance and no further orders with respect to waiving of rent have been passed by the Delhi government after April.On Tuesday, the bench said that it cannot do charity at the cost of others. It said that the plea proceeds on the presumption that tenants alone are suffering from financial hardship, or from the economic consequences of the pandemic and consequent lockdown.“However, it ought to be kept in mind that even the landlords can be financially dependent on the rent, that is when the rented premises is given by a widow or by a retired person having no other means of income and when they are solely dependent on the rent, for their livelihood,” it said.The bench also said that there are several instances where rented premises are occupied by tenants who are running shops, malls and doing other commercial activities. It said that without going through the specific facts of each and every case, no dispute in relation to the payment of rent and eviction thereof can be decided by the court between tenants and landlord.“There cannot be lumpsum/general submission and that too in a Public Interest Litigation, that rent should be waived and there can be no eviction on the ground of non-payment of the rent for tenants who are poor. Hence, this writ petition is devoid of any merits as a public interest,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-dismisses-plea-seeking-waiver-of-rent-during-lockdown-period/story-cv8tQZHy84PLGs9o8OZ24I.html

It directed the Delhi government to work in collaboration with the Delhi State Legal Services Authority for this purpose.The courg directed the Delhi government to set up a help desk in the evenings, after 6.00 pm, at the Azadpur Mandi so that shelter and ready meals can be offered to those returning there late in the evening and usually spend the nights in the open.It asked the counsel for the government to file an affidavit indicating compliance of its directions and listed the matter for further hearing on June 24.On the last date, the court had directed the government to find out the exact number of workers stranded at the Mandi. The Delhi government carried out a survey and filed a report, stating that 882 labourers were registered at their help desk set up at the marketplace.The report stated that out of the 882 workers, 849 gave their permanent residential address as outside Delhi and remaining did not disclose it.The survey also found that around 143 labourers were staying within the marketplace, either in sheds or shops of local traders and the rest in nearby rented accommodation.The report stated that 436 labourers brought food from home and the remaining 446 were getting ready meals from a nearby hunger relief centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/send-back-stranded-workers-at-azadpur-mandi-to-home-states-delhi-hc/story-aKupzQ85mEYtkG32I71iHK.html

It said that currently there is no provision for online sale of medicines under the Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940. However, keeping the public interest in wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, it allowed the sale with certain conditions to be fulfilled by the license holder.In an affidavit filed before Justice Navin Chawla, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, told the court it has realised that the retail sale of drugs to the doorstep of consumers is essential to meet the emergency arising due to the pandemic.The MH&FW told the court that it amended an earlier notification it had issued on the sale of online medicines and allowed the sale of online medicines to the license holders with conditions laid down under the Drugs and Cosmetic Act, 1940 as well as those by the ministry.The affidavit was submitted to the court while hearing a plea by South Chemists and Distributors who had sought direction to the Centre to de-link a website, which is promoting sale of medicines through e-pharmacies, from Aarogya Setu mobile application.On Tuesday, the Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Maninder Kaur Acharya told the court that the website has been de-linked from the Aarogya Setu application.

If the university administration makes even slightest mistakes in ensuring preventive measures many lives will be at risk.

This shows the hypocrisy of the V-C who is ready to conduct exams by risking students’ lives but is not ready to meet them.

Till now, the police have filed charge sheets against 121 of the 125 Malaysian nationals.The court’s order came during the hearing of a plea by Fahrul Naim Bin Mohd Noor, a Malaysian, in which he said that they are in the custody of the High Commission of Malaysia in the national capital and sought a direction to establish one designated court to adjudicate upon the charge sheet in an expeditious manner.The plea, filed by advocate S Hari Haran, said the charge sheets were filed in the competent court. On Wednesday, a city court posted the charge sheets for cognizance for a further date since it was not an urgent matter.“The Malaysian nationals are stranded in the country away from the kith and kin for almost three months. The High Commission of Malaysia is spending substantial money on maintaining these stranded citizens which could be diverted for other constructive purposes including fighting the pandemic. The subordinate court is likely to take a substantial time to start trying cases in regular courses,” the plea said.The court impleaded ministries of home and external affairs, as parties in the petition and asked them to respond as well and listed the matter for further hearing on July 1.Till date, 47 charge sheets have been filed against 915 foreigners, belonging to 34 different countries, in the case.According to the charge sheets, all the foreign nationals have been booked for violating visa rules, violating government guidelines issued in the wake of Covid-19 pandemic and regulations under Epidemic Diseases Act, Disaster Management Act and prohibitory orders under section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure.They have also been charged with offences under sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule) of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Foreigners Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/malaysians-who-attended-markaz-event-seek-a-designated-court-for-trial-against-them/story-fSJEQKOaMFtcUfuWIpm7LP.html

Kuldeep Srivastava, the head of the regional forecasting centre of the IMD, said that a cyclonic circulation over West Bengal and the neighbourhood will move towards southwest Uttar Pradesh by June 19 and June 20.“It will help in further advancement of the monsoon in west Uttar Pradesh, some parts of Uttarakhand, northeast Rajasthan and eastern Haryana between June 22 and June 24,” he said.This means that the wind system will reach the national capital by June 22-23, which is three to four days earlier.  The IMD has predicted normal rainfall (103 per cent) for northwest India this year.Srivastava said dry weather will prevail in Delhi on June 18 and June 19.On Wednesday, most places in the city recorded the mercury above the 40 degrees Celsius-mark.The Safdarjung Observatory, which provides representative figures for the city, recorded a maximum of 41 degrees Celsius, which was two notches above normal.The weather stations at Pusa and Palam recorded the maximum temperature at 42.8 degrees Celsius and 42.4 degrees Celsius, respectively.  Humidity levels oscillated between 43 and 77 per cent.  The MeT department has predicted a partly cloudy sky and strong surface winds (upto 30 kilometers per hour) on Thursday. The maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to settle at 41 and 29 degrees Celsius.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/monsoon-likely-to-reach-delhi-by-june-22-23-says-imd/story-3bZFFc1YAqeqOUFA3rGQUI.html

He asked him to comply with decisions taken during June 6 meetings,” the official said.“When asked to clear the area, the Chinese troops displayed an aggressive behaviour and assaulted our men in larger number,” he added.The official said the Chinese also resorted to stone pelting in which Colonel Santosh Babu was grievously injured. “The group of Indian soldiers, who accompanied the commanding officer, tried to evacuate him while the rest remained engaged with the Chinese troops. He was brought back to the base camp where he later succumbed to the injuries,” the official said.“Some more troops from our side rushed to assist their colleagues who were already engaged with the Chinese. Accordingly, more Chinese troops were also brought in and clashes continued for some time,” he said, adding that the scuffle continued till few hours in the night.The Chinese troops had also used iron rods and clubs in the attack, he said.“The Chinese troops resorted to pushing and stone pelting. Due to limited space and steep gradients of mountains, some soldiers slipped and fell into the gorge and Galwan River. While some were hurt in clashes, the remaining were hurt by rocks as they slipped and some suffered hypothermia due to falling into Galwan waters at freezing temperatures. Search operations were undertaken to retrieve those who had fallen into or along the river. They were rushed to medical facilities established in the area, where some of them were declared brought dead,” the official said.“Had the Chinese troops removed tents, which was agreed on at the corps commander level meet, the violent clashes would not have taken place. Chinese betrayed the agreement and then attacked the commanding officer which triggered the clashes,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/galwan-valley-face-off-attack-on-bihar-regiment-commanding-officer-triggered-clashes/story-Ok4K33xxtKDt6R9g3E886J.html

17-06-2020||Mumbai||Mahua flower collectors poison tigress, her cubs near Tadoba, 3 arrested||After the carcasses of three tigers were found in a span of five days (June 10-14) in the buffer area of Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) in Chandrapur, the forest department on Wednesday arrested three people that confessed to poisoning the big cats.On Tuesday evening, forest officials had detained three villagers from Kondegaon, Moharli in the buffer of TATR - Suryabhan Thackeray, 60, Shravan Madabi, 47, and Narendra Dadmal, 49 - for questioning. “All three confessed to the crime during overnight questioning and were arrested on Wednesday afternoon. They will be produced before a local court for their quantum of punishment on Thursday,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife). According to the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, an offence involving a species listed in Schedule-I (Tiger) attracts imprisonment of three years, which may be extended to seven years depending on the severity of the crime committed. There is also a mandatory fine of at least ₹10,000.Based on their confession, they intended to kill the tigers by poisoning a wild boar, said Kakodkar. “The villagers are Mahua flower (Madhuca longifolia) collectors. After fermenting and distilling the flowers to make country liquor, the dried remains were left near the village, where the accused added poison to kill a wild boar for their own consumption. However, after spotting that there were tigers in the area for a few days, they laid poison on the remainder of the boar’s carcass,” said Kakodkar.“According to the villagers’ confession, while the tigers died after eating the boar, the langurs may have been poisoned after they consumed some of the remaining dried mahua flowers,” said Kakodkar. “The carcasses have been sent for forensic analysis, and the results will confirm confessions made by the accused.”On June 10, the forest department found the carcass of an adult tigress near Kondegaon talao, Moharli range in compartment number 956. The area is non-forest land in the buffer of TATR, but in close proximity to the adjoining core zone. On June 14, the carcass of two sub-adult tigers, the tigress’ cubs, were found 300 m away from the one recovered on June 10. The department had said since all three tigers did not have injury marks and all body parts were intact, infighting or poaching was ruled out while they suspected death by poisoning. The carcasses of two langurs were also found in the area on June 14. The post-mortem of the adult tigress had shown that she had consumed a wild boar shortly before her death.Meanwhile, the forest department suspects there could be a third cub of the tigress, which may have also died. “We were informed that the mother had three cubs. We have not been able to find the third cub’s body yet but search operations are underway across the buffer area at the moment,” Kakodkar said.There have been seven tiger deaths in Maharashtra this year, of which six have been reported from Chandrapur, in and around TATR. As opposed, 22 people have been killed in tiger attacks this year across the state, 18 deaths involving mahua, tendu or other forest produce collectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mahua-flower-collectors-poison-tigress-her-cubs-near-tadoba-3-arrested/story-M95KoyunmXMV2kw2CQ1HkK.html

Their presence was more to avoid membership disqualification. However, the general body was quickly adjourned when the opposition parties, including the Congress and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) started questioning the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the administration on how it spent Rs 125 crore while tackling the Covid-19 situation.Despite the opposition parties’ demand, leader of House Dheeraj Ghate proposed to adjourn the meeting till July amidst resistance from the Congress and the NCP members.Mayor Murlidhar Mohol intervened at the house discussion and said, “Almost all the elected members and officers are working on the field. More than 150 people are in the hall and the central air conditioning is on. Everyone is aware about the Covid-19 precautions. We just called the meeting to avoid the technical and legal problems for elected members. I would like to appeal to all that if anything goes wrong (Covid-19 precautions), all will need to pay the price.”The mayor agreed that elected members would get proper information and instructed the municipal administration to give written information to members from regional ward offices.Post lockdown restrictions, the civic administration had postponed general body meetings leaving authorities in a fix as any further delay could have resulted in 98 corporators losing membership. To avoid disqualification of members, PMC called the general body meeting on Wednesday. All the 162 corporators marked their attendance at the register before leaving the PMC building.As per the Bombay Provincial Municipal Corporation Act (1949), if an elected member remains absent for three consecutive general body meetings without any information, he or she is liable to be disqualified from membership. To avoid this technical issue, corporators attended the meeting and signed on the attendance register.The mayor said, “The purpose of calling the meeting was to avoid the disqualification issue. After running the general body meeting for half an hour, ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) adjourned it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-general-body-meets-after-lockdown-adjourns-as-opposition-questions-covid-expenditure/story-e4oV2pBZyiiuZxGllNa4AI.html

It took the duo just three minutes to orchestrate the crime as they entered the bank during the lunch break at 1:42pm and left by 1:45pm. There was no security guard deputed outside the branch, situated on a secluded stretch near Hotel Cama. Five women employees were present in the bank, when the accused, wearing face masks and gloves, reached there. While one pointed a gun and knife at the cashier and asked her to hand over the money, the other threatened remaining employees to keep standing at their positions and not raise the alarm. After filling the money in a suitcase, they left the premises and fled in a white Hyundai i20. No one was held hostage or injured during the heist, said superintendent of police (city) Harvinder Singh Virk, who rushed to the spot.“The two men seem to be in their 30s. They were holding an air pistol and knife. Mask of one of them fell when they were leaving the spot. We are trying to identify them through CCTV footage,” he said.A case has been registered under Section 392 (robbery) of the Indian Penal Code besides the Arms Act at the Mataur police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-armed-men-rob-4-8-lakh-from-pnb-s-all-women-branch-in-mohali/story-GurWKV2wpheFYoZgXQj4gI.html

Doctors will visit these centres twice a day and patients can avail home food. This way we can save hospital beds for extreme cases,” said Banerjee, adding that she can also offer her own house to be transformed into a safe home centre if need arises. She also said that both private and government hospitals will now have to upload data on number of beds available every hour on public domain so that citizens can approach the right hospital while admitting a patient.The decision was taken as reports of hospitals refusing to admit patients and demanding higher charges were pouring in since the pandemic started. The chief secretary is expected to hold a meeting with top brass of private hospitals on Thursday. The government has also decided to give special incentive to frontline workers such as police, doctors, municipal staff and others, working covid-affected areas. “They would be getting incentive at par with government employees working if difficult areas,” the chief minister said.To build up on the pool of doctors, the state government has also decided to rope in final year medical students, interns and post graduate trainees to join the covid war. At present around 8,000 doctors and 5,000 nurses are already working in the field.Banerjee said that the positivity rate of Bengal has shot up from 2.7% in May to around 3.4%. The migrant labourers started returning in May. This is however still lower than the national positivity rate of 5.8%, she added.“I would request people not to hide if they show any symptoms. Those who tried to hide it are in danger now,” Banerjee said while citing examples of one of her party’s leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/covid-patients-with-mild-symptoms-to-be-treated-in-safe-home-centres-in-bengal-mamata-banerjee/story-tkYNLQ43WYo45wbAYZuMQM.html

So, he is deliberately creating these problems to divert attention from his failures,” said the Tibetan official.He said China first occupied Tibet and now was eying the Indian Territory. “It’s time that India asked China to vacate the Tibetan territory and go behind the great wall,” he said.“Many Indian leaders had said Tibet should be liberated otherwise China would come at our borders. That’s exactly what is now happening,” he said.Tibetan writer and independence activist Tenzin Tsundue said there may be several reasons behind the Chinese move.In May, India devised a new policy to stop Chinese investment in India, said Tsundue. Secondly, India banded with Australia-EU led UN resolution against China for probe into Covid-19. After Namaste Trump India received plugging-gap missiles from the US, boosting the military arms, he said.“China is in a shambles. The country that depends on 70% of its income from production and export is suddenly caught in a pandemic. It has lost businesses, jobs, its exports are stuck and the country is getting isolated diplomatically, triggering a sense of insecurity and fear of internal turmoil. All these failures have resulted in Jinping’s leadership being questioned. Now, foreign companies are leaving China and setting up base in India,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lac-stand-off-will-go-on-unless-tibet-issue-is-resolved-says-exiled-govt/story-svWkAdkXkpgOe9R5kKOtrL.html

17-06-2020||Chandigarh||J&K has the lowest mortality and morbidity figures: SKIMS director||With the number of Covid-19 cases surging in Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), HT’s Mir Ehsan talks to Sher-I-Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences (SKIMS) director AG Ahangar about the UT’s testing rate, health infrastructure, community transmission and patient care. Edited excerpts:How is the situation in J&K vis-à-vis Covid-19? Is there cause for alarm?So far, Covid-19 has claimed around 3.5 lakh lives and infected around 7.6 million people globally. The mortality rate is over 10% in some European countries. Our region has also been affected, which is alarming given the population density and non-availability of an effective curative medicine or vaccine.You recently said J&K was in community transmission mode. What precautions should be followed?As per data collected over the last month, transmission in J&K is not just on account of foreign travellers, migrants, or those with contact history. The public should strictly adhere to government directives and expert medical advises as well as guidelines issued by health-care agencies from time-to-time, including the use of protective gear, observing social distancing and hand hygiene. They should avoid social and religious gatherings.Is our health infrastructure sufficient to tackle a surge in Covid-19 cases, especially in J&K?Our infrastructure is far better than the national average, both in the public and private sector. J&K ranks first in testing, contact tracing, surveillance and treatment of patients. It has the lowest mortality, morbidity figures till date. The positive prevalence in J&K is 1.68%, a mortality rate of 1.62% mortality rate and 0.73% hospital admissions.We have already crossed 5,000 cases and reported around 60 deaths. Is this a big number considering our population ratio? If we look at the entire J&K population, the figures are minuscule. What matters is the doubling time, incidence of co-morbidities, extremities of age and immunocompromised patient population. Fortunately, ours society does not have the concept of old age homes, which has been the primary source of anxiety world over.Are we testing enough and what is the role of SKIMS in the testing and patient care?We have taken a lead role in testing the population for Covid-19. SKIMS has conducted around 80,000 tests so far, which is higher than any lab in the country, an overall incidence of 13.172 per million population. We are quite ahead of Delhi. We have tested around 12,000 people in three days and around 5,000 people in a single day, which speaks volumes for the robust mechanism in place. We have dedicated a separate and exclusive Covid-19 specific infectious diseases block with a capacity of 50 beds and all facilities.SKIMS is the biggest hospital in J&K. Do you think other areas were neglected or patient care suffered?SKIMS continues to run outpatient department services both on campus and through virtual clinics and telemedicine besides running efficient teaching programs. Patient care in all these spheres, both Covid and non-Covid, continues to be distinctive.How many patients with Covid-19 in SKIMS need ventilator support?Most patients recover of their own as their immunity systems fight off the infection. In some cases medical management is needed, wherein ventilator support is a cornerstone. Patients who have moderate to severe symptoms with unstable parameters need supportive management and at times high-flow oxygen, ventilator support or advanced life support in the form of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) or lung transplant. In a well-organised and developed patient care centre like SKIMS, high-flow oxygen and supportive measures can be the game changers whereas ventilator support is used only when unavoidable. We have sufficient ventilators available and will be purchasing more to tackle any eventuality.Any suggestions for bringing down Covid-19 numbers in the Valley?WHO directives and governmental standard operating procedures should be followed. One should understand that doctors and paramedics are fighting the war against the coronavirus with sensibility and strategy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/j-k-has-the-lowest-mortality-and-morbidity-figures-skims-director/story-jFZkzU9PRpxInIv6XKpdpJ.html

17-06-2020||Pune||Shetti accepts NCP’s council seat offer during his meeting with Pawar at Baramati||Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghatana (SSS) leader Raju Shetti, who once rattled Sharad Pawar’s politics by holding protests at Baramati, visited his house Govindbaug on Tuesday and accepted NCP’s offer of a seat in the Maharashtra Legislative Council.“I have accepted the offer for council polls,” said Shetti after his two-and-a-half-hour-long meeting with Pawar which the farmers’ leader termed “fruitful”.The meeting between Shetti and Pawar came days after NCP state unit chief Jayant Patil visited Swabhimani Paksha founder leader’s home in Shirole and offered him a seat from NCP quota. Pawar while reacting to his meeting with Shetti tweeted, “I Visited various projects of Agriculture Development Trust in Baramati with Swabhimani Shetkari Sanghtana leader Raju Shetti.”Twelve seats fell vacant from Governor’s quota earlier this month. The Maha Vikas Aghadi is contemplating on to go ahead to fill them as early as possible. “By offering a seat to Shetti in state legislative council, NCP has tried to pacify sugarcane growers from western Maharashtra, its erstwhile political base,” said Chitra Lele, Political Science professor at SNDT.For Shetti, a former two-time MP from Hatkanangale in Kolhapur, to accept a seat from NCP quota is coming a long way even as he had already joined hands with Congress-NCP alliance just before the 2019 Lok Sabha polls after breaking away from BJP-led National Democratic Alliance.During the Lok Sabha polls, NCP decided not to contest polls from Hatkanangale, from where Shetti fought against Shiv Sena’s Dhairyasheel Mane and lost. “To keep the BJP away, we joined hands with the NCP and the Congress in 2019 and it was part of that the NCP had left one seat for us then. Today I have accepted to be MVA candidate for council polls.”It was in November 2011, when Shetti held protest in Baramati for increased sugarcane prices, it rattled NCP chief Sharad Pawar.

17-06-2020||Pune||11% of Pune’s Covid fatalities showed no associated risk factors||Eleven per cent of the deaths related to Covid-19 in Pune district had no associated risk factor or comorbidity, according to data shared by the Pune district administration in its latest report, released on June 15. Public health experts attribute mortalities among patients without co-morbid conditions to “delayed reporting” of the infection, caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus. According to the death analysis report compiled by district health department, of the 485 deaths reported till June 14, 427 or 88% had associated risk factors, while 58 deaths or 11% did not have any associated risk factor. The common pre-existing ailments that can be fatal for a Covid-19 positive patient include blood pressure, kidney and liver disease, diabetes and respiratory illness. The report also states that most deaths took place at least seven days after the onset of symptoms, while 15% of deaths were reported within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms. According to Dr Ashok Nandapurkar, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Pune district, in most cases, people reported to hospital after severe breathlessness, which is a sign that virus has infected the lungs. “We have observed in some cases, people go to hospital complaining of breathlessness and not complaining of fever, which is one of the initial symptoms of the infection. When we question further we get to know that the person had complained of fever and took antibiotics which suppressed the symptoms, and later, it turned into respiratory discomfort,” said Dr Nandapurkar. He said that respiratory issues do not come up immediately if the person is fit and has no pre-existing ailments.“It takes about five-six days of infection for the respiratory system to be affected, which then becomes a bit challenging to treat. However, Covid-19 infection is sufficient to cause mortality as it disturbs the respiratory system and then, the blood clotting mechanism, which affects all organs,” said Dr Nandapurkar. Dr Dileep Kadam, professor of medicine at the Kashibai Navale Medical College, who also heads the Pune Covid-19 task force, believes it has to be taken on a case-to-case basis to analyse why Covid-19 positive persons without a risk factor died.“It really depends on a case-to-case basis. However, if the condition of the patient is critical during admission, then it is difficult for doctors to revive the patient’s condition,” Dr Kadam said.

Well, gone are the days when matching dupattas used to be the concern after purchase of a suit. The summer of 2020, amid Covid-19 pandemic, has made women lap up the idea of matching masks with ethnic wear, to stay safe yet trendy while flaunting comfortable fashion apparels all day long. “Since masks are going to be an unavoidable part of our lives for a good time to come, so why not make them fashionable?” opines Shuchi Singh, a Delhi-based author, adding, “It also generates revenue for many small businesses who are designing and producing these masks. I’ve ordered some pretty ones for myself in ikat and pochampally prints (to match with my attires).Some boutique owners have started designing such matching masks out of concern for the safety of their regular customers. Shilpi Gari, who owns a boutique Trisha Fabrics in Delhi’s Rohini, is stitching masks in line with the design and matching colour of the suits that have come to her from her clients. Gari informs, “Masks will continue to be part of our lives due to corona. Ladies ko aur kya chahiye hota hai – matching colour, matching har cheez. All these plain white and black ones have become old now. Ladies want everything in latest fashion. People were demanding ki masks bhi bana do kurte ke saath match karke; so I started making these as well. I’m not charging extra for them though. It’s free of cost, from my side, for their safety. Now that courier services have resumed, more orders are coming in as well.”Rashmi Dawar, a boutique owner in Gurugram adds, “It’s really hot right now, and cotton masks are not just comfortable but also look good. I have started designing them for my clients, and have been getting a lot of enquiries, too. I’m observing that people are going more for matching masks with suits and casual wear than with formal or semi-formal attires.” The store owners at some of the popular suit markets especially in Delhi-NCR, are also cashing in on the rising popularity and necessity of matching masks with suits. Surbhi Maggon, owner of an apparel studio in Rajouri Garden, echoes this sentiment and adds that summer isn’t complete without cottons and “now matching the masks with an ethnic dress is the way to go forward” for many fashion savvy women. Sapna Mangwani, an Agra-based boutique owner says that she’s delivering matching masks in Delhi-NCR, and adds, “We’ve got enquiries from Jaipur, and Bengaluru, too. During the lockdown itself we had thought that whenever we open we’d make masks available along with dresses and suits, in the same material. This will of course help us sustain as well. And in the coming days, we have thought of making matching cotton gloves, which are washable, so that women can wear them when they go out shopping for groceries, etc.” Author tweets @NainaaroraFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/fashion-and-trends/unlockfashion-ladies-amp-up-style-quotient-with-masks-stitched-to-match-ethnic-suits/story-H9iT1W1Xzq4GpwrRSr9eTJ.html

The birth of 116 gharials on the Gandak River, which flows into Bihar from Nepal and covers over 320km in the state, has made it an occasion for celebration.Samir Kumar Sinha, deputy director of the Wildlife Trust of India (WTI), said the river has registered successful breeding of the endangered gharials for three consecutive years now.“It is indeed great news from the Gandak River to make World Crocodile Day celebration special. We were really happy to see little gharials coming out from under the sand. In March, we had carried out a survey and the number came to 260, now it will grow further,” Sinha said.“There was a time when gharials were widespread across the Indian subcontinent, but the number dropped alarmingly by 2006 to put them under the endangered list,” he added.Getting a cue from the congregation of adult male and female gharials, WTI researchers identified three sites along the river with chances of crocodile nesting this year.“One of the potential sites was downstream Ratwal bridge, where we recorded 8-10 adult females in March 2020 survey,” Subrat Kumar Behera of WTI, who led the survey team, said.“We engaged nest watchers from local communities to keep close eyes on gharial nesting. It is important because the nests often get eroded due to a sudden rise in water level and fast current after the release of water from the barrage at Valmiki Nagar in the last week of March,” Behera added.In early April, three nests with 94 eggs of the fish-eating crocodiles were located and shifted to a safe place away from the bank to protect against the erosion.Amid the coronavirus lockdown, a team of four local watchers looked after the nest till the eggs successfully hatched into 86 gharials on June 14 after 65-70 days of incubation.“The hatchlings (gharial babies) were released in the river exactly where the nests were located first. The baby hatchlings were united with the mother,” said Sinha. One nest in the same area, which remained undetected by the team, also hatched with 30 more babies. So, 116 gharial babies have been added to the Gandak River.WTI’s Sinha, who is also the member of the state board for wildlife chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar, said the Gandak gharial conservation project had started in 2014 and there has been a consistent and good increase in the number of the critically endangered species in the last few years.“We had released 30 captive-born gharials from the Patna zoo into the river and started monitoring them. We soon discovered that the Gandak provided the natural breeding ground for them. Their number has been consistently on the rise,” he added.Bihar’s forest department started a project with WTI to strengthen the Gandak’s gharial population by releasing the captive-born crocodiles into the river in 2014-15, followed by protection of nests engaging locals.The state holds global importance as the Gandak hosts the second largest population of these reptiles in its current distribution range in India, Nepal and Bangladesh, said Sinha.The State Board for Wildlife, chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar, has given nod to notify a 150-km stretch of the river as a Conservation Reserve. It will help not only the critically endangered gharial but also India’s aquatic animal – the Ganges River Dolphin. In a survey in 2018, 155 dolphins were recorded in the river.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/116-endangered-gharial-hatchlings-born-in-bihar-s-gandak-river/story-JDFrwqqWPO2KItwK1XQwqK.html

SIT HAS CHANGED ITS THEORY: DEFENCE Defense counsel Gursahib Singh Brar said the SIT had changed its theory. “Now, they claim that Brar’s weapon was used to create marks on an escort vehicle. We challenged their argument, however, the court ordered police custody till June 21,” he said. The SIT probe found that Brar was allegedly involved in making fake bullets marks on the pilot gypsy of the ex-Moga SSP after the police firing incident at Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015, in which two Sikh protestors were killed. The probe found that the escort vehicle was later allegedly taken to Brar’s house, where around 18 fake bullets marks were created.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/behbal-kalan-police-firing-advocate-accused-of-fabricating-evidence-sent-to-police-custody-till-june-21/story-d6ls3eCRhRHH9XfboTYwMP.html

Dr D N Sharma, head of the Radiation Oncology department at AIIMS and the principal investigator of the research project, said two Covid-19 patients who were on oxygen support were given the therapy last Saturday and their condition has improved since then.“Both the patients, aged above 50, who are admitted at the National Cancer Institute, AIIMS, Jhajjar Centre are off the oxygen support now,” Dr Sharma said.“Radiation therapy usually is given in high doses for cancer treatment but in this case we are giving a safe low dose of radiation at 70 cGy in one sitting to the patient,” he elaborated.The entire treatment takes around 15 to 20 minutes and has no side-effects.According to Sharma, this treatment mode was used till 1940s for treating pneumonia when there were no antibiotics. Under the pilot project, eight more patients will undergo the therapy after which the data of the results will be analysed. If the therapy is found is to be effective in COVID-19 treatment in moderate to severe cases, the research project would be expanded further. “Similar studies are being conducted in the US, Spain and Italy also,” Sharma said.The death toll due to Covid-19 rose to 11,903, while the number of cases climbed to 3,54,065 on Wednesday.The government on Saturday released a revised protocol for the treatment of coronavirus infection, allowing use of antiviral drug remdesivir in moderate cases and hydroxychloroquine in patients during the early course of the disease.It also recommended off-label application of tocilizumab, a drug that modifies the immune system or its functioning, and convalescent plasma for treating coronavirus-infected patients in moderate stage of the illness, besides adding loss of smell or taste to the list of Covid-19 symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aiims-conducts-pilot-study-to-assess-effect-of-radiation-therapy-on-covid-19-patients/story-Pxw8a1VSXhk7i4K2CbVDoK.html

To realise the Chief Minister’s wish, the state’s Mati Kala Board has started working.Sculptors from Gorakhpur, Lucknow-based expert Krishna Kumar Srivastava, UPID (UP Institute of Design) designers Sarika Verma and Vandana Prajapati along with culptorsfrom Gorakhpur will be creating a model.Moulds, sprays and automatic machines will be ordered and given to the people associated with sculpture designing. In addition, the expert team will also give training to those who will produce the product locally.Recently, a meeting was held in this regard under the chairmanship of Navneet Sehgal, General Manager and Principal Secretary, Micro, Small and Medium Industries (MSME), Mati Arts Board. It was decided during the meeting that to compete with the Chinese products in terms of quality and price in making the Gauri-Ganesh sculptures and designer diyas, three things are necessary -- the size (8 to 12 inches) of the idols that are most in demand, Plaster of Paris mould for these sculptures should be introduced, and machines should be used for better and more efficient production.It was also decided that sculpture expert Krishna Kumar Srivastava will model the sculptures. Its mould will be brought from Kolkata. Srivastava, an MA in Fine Arts with specialisation in sculptures said: “We can do better than China. The Chinese viewpoint is just commercial, but our work will be straight from the heart. There are reasons for this. For example, Diwali is our festival, and Gauri-Ganesh is worshiped on this day.”Amarpal, who has also done MA in Fine Arts with expertise in sculpture, says: “For the first time. any head of the state has thought so much about the artistes associated with clay work. So it is our duty to live up to the intent. Four-five models of Gauri-Ganesh idols will be ready soon.”(The story has been published from a wire feed without any modifications to the text, only the headline has been changed.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/locally-made-clay-idols-to-replace-chinese-gauri-ganesh-in-up/story-ZK03jgjRURhtdmQnjxxrmN.html

17-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi to get world’s biggest Covid-19 facility, the size of 22 football fields||Delhi is all set to get the world’s largest Covid-19 care facility to help in the treatment of coronavirus disease patients.The national capital recorded the highest number of deaths - 93 - in a 24-hour period (till Tuesday evening). The city now has 44,688 infections in all with 1,837 of them succumbing to the disease.To ramp up the capacity of beds in the national capital, the Delhi government has started converting South Delhi’s Radha Soami Spiritual Centre into a care facility. It will have over 200 halls and 10,000 beds.The area of the spiritual centre is as large as the over 22 football fields. There will also be a provision of accommodation for doctors at one side of the facility.“The complex will be fully ready by June 30 for the treatment of the patients. It is being constructed with tents. It will have adequate lighting and fans. Coolers will also be installed in each hall,” an official of the centre was quoted as saying by new outlets.On Sunday, Delhi Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal visited the Radha Soami Satsang centre and was apprised with the technical information about the facilities.The Delhi government is seeking to further increase the number of beds available for patients by setting up makeshift hospitals in 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls. The idea is to add 15,800 beds for sick patients. Five hundred converted railway coaches will add another 8,000 beds for the city’s Covid-19 patients.Of the total beds, those in the hotels will be paid facilities with private hospitals pitching in staff and consumables. As per the government’s May 29 order, five-star hotels will be allowed to charge Rs 5,000 and three or four-star hospitals Rs 4,000 per patient per day, with the linked hospitals allowed to charge up to Rs 5,000 for medical services and consumables a day.The state government is in talks with the Delhi Medical Association to provide staff for the makeshift hospitals.After addition of more deaths to Covid-19 fatality count, the mortality rate in Delhi rose to 4.1 per cent. In comparison, the national mortality rate stands at 3.3 per cent.With the number of Covid-19 tests in the national capital increasing to 7,786 on Tuesday, the positivity rate - the number of people who tested positive among those tested – has come down to almost 24 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-get-world-s-biggest-covid-19-facility-the-size-of-22-football-fields/story-F2VGnfVsLGZf6Bz3aQr9WP.html

I always believe in fulfilling promises. My promise for the next tenure is -- har khet ko pani (water for irrigating every farm)”.At a function organized at the CM’s secretariat here, Kumar inaugurated through video conference road construction projects worth more than Rs 500 crore catering to districts like East Champaran, Lakhisarai and Rohtas.With a ghost of a smile on his lips, Kumar displayed mock anger and turned towards Chief Secretary Deepak Kumar and said, “I do not feel happy inaugurating projects from so far. From the next time, kindly make arrangements so that we can visit the place concerned and behold the projects upon completion.”  The chief minister also said, “I understand that many restrictions have been put in place because of the coronavirus pandemic. But we can find a way out, observing all the guidelines and social distancing.”  Kumar recalled that he had visited East Champaran and Lakhisarai for laying foundation of Rs 263.43-crore RCC bridge and a barrage involving an expenditure of Rs 146.25 crore, respectively. “I would have preferred to be at these places again, when the projects have been completed for dedicating these to the public. I would have similarly liked to be at Sasaram,” he said, referring to the district headquarters of Rohtas where foundation stone for a 122.39 crore bypass was laid. The chief minister’s remarks came amid repeated barbs by the opposition RJD, and aides-turned-adversaries like Prashant Kishor, that Kumar was feeling “scared” of stepping out of his house.RJD’s chief ministerial candidate Tejashwi Yadav has announced that his party workers across the state will beat drums on June 24 when the 69-year-old Kumar would have “completed 100 days staying at home”.The CM added that he would also like to visit places where works were under progress and review things first hand, in a veiled rebuff to Yadav’s claim that Kumar was unaware of the ground realities and went by whatever inputs he was fed by the bureaucrats. Kumar, who heads the JD(U), also subtly berated his arch rival Lalu Prasad, the founding president of RJD -- which he ousted from power in 2005 -- and said “before we took over, connectivity through roads and bridges was so poor. There has been such a massive improvement since then”. “We also place emphasis on maintenance of roads, since only construction is not enough. I remember when I was a child, my house was situated alongside a major highway and maintenance of roads used to be given priority. Things deteriorated over the years and in the 1990s maintenance seemed to have been given up altogether,” said Kumar, referring to the period during which Prasad and his wife ruled Bihar as successive chief ministers.He also insisted that the response of the people of Bihar to the Covid-19 safety guidelines has been exemplary. Cabinet colleagues like Deputy CM Sushil Kumar Modi, road construction minister Nand Kishore Yadav and water resources minister Sanjay Jha were among those who also addressed the function.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/cm-nitish-kumar-indirectly-ticks-off-oppn-expresses-wish-to-travel-out-of-patna/story-Nijbb5wDe7WoeTQOVu9ZSJ.html

The temple is believed to be around 450 to 500 years old had submerged during a flood in 1933.The archaeological survey team of the Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH) recently claimed that they discovered an ancient submerged temple in the Mahanadi upstream from Cuttack.“The temple had submerged a long time back but around 11 years ago, the temple started emerging again. Now the temple is visible a little bit above the water level. A research team is also working on it,” said a villager. The temple was successfully located after repeated attempts by Anil Kumar Dhir and his Project Assistant Deepak Kumar Nayak of Indian National Trust for Art and Cultural Heritage (INTACH).The top of the submerged temple was discovered mid-river near Baideswar in the Padmavati village near Nayagarh. The 55 to 60 feet submerged temple dates back to the late 15th or early 16th century, considering the construction style of the Mastaka and material used for the construction.According to INTACH Chief Anil Kumar Dhir, the 55 to 60 feet long temple which belongs to Lord Gopinath, a form of Lord Vishnu dates back to the late 15th or early 16th century.“This temple has a very old history. This temple is around 450 to 500 years old. Lord’s idol from this temple was taken to another temple. We are working on a project--documenting the Mahanadi valley so we were in search of this temple. Around a week ago we were informed that the upper surface of the temple is visible,” said Dhir.“It is in a good state of preservation. The temple should be re-established the temple as we have technology with us. This is not the first submerged temple that has been recovered by us,” he added. The region where the temple has been found used to be regarded as ‘Satapatana’. Padmabati village was part of Satapatana which is a combination of seven villages. The temple was dedicated to Lord Gopinath Dev.With the river changing its course due to flooding 150 years ago, its flow changed and the entire village was submerged by the river in 1933 during a flood.Anil Kumar Dhir said, there are around 65 temples in the area that are underwater but only ‘mastaka’ of Gopinath Deba temple was visible for some years as it was the tallest.Deepak Nayak, who with the help of a local heritage enthusiast Rabindra Rana located the temple, was aware of its existence as the submerged top portion used to be visible in summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ancient-temple-submerged-in-river-mahanadi-resurfaces-in-odisha-s-nayagarh/story-Jo9e1oooKptfOOVaqMuoCP.html

At a press conference, state Health Secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh said the latest casualty has been reported from Katihar district and the man had recently returned from Delhi. Among the fatalities reported earlier in the state, Begusarai, Khagaria and Vaishali districts have accounted for three deaths each, while Bhojpur, Darbhanga, Jehanabad, Muzaffarpur, Patna, Saran, Sitamarhi and Siwan have reported two deaths each.

More than 5,000 of the state’s Covid-19 cases have been reported in the past one month and the spike has been attributed to heavy influx of migrants who began coming back to Bihar from across the country since the beginning of May when the Centre agreed to run “Shramik Specials” upon the request of respective state governments.

17-06-2020||Kolkata||Dhankhar compared Bengal to Satyajit Ray’s satire on dictatorship, triggers outrage||Nine months of acrimony between West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and the Trinamool Congress (TMC) government reached a new high on Tuesday. It subjected the Raj Bhawan to scrutiny hours after its incumbent compared the state to the dictatorship depicted by film director Satyajit Ray in his landmark 1980 movie Hirak Rajar Deshe (Land of the Diamond King).Ray portrayed a king who was obsessed with his diamond mines and subjected farmers, labourers and students to slavery and clinical brainwashing before being ousted by mass revolution. Produced by the then Left Front government, the film is considered a satire on Emergency and the Congress regime in the ’70s.Dhankhar, a former Janata Dal Lok Sabha MP from Rajasthan’s Jhunjhunu and Union minister of state for parliamentary affairs, has been in the eye of the storm for his social media comments ever since becoming a governor for the first time in July last year.“Time to heed message in Satyajit Ray masterpiece-Hirak Rajar Deshe- one of the best satires against state oppression film industry has ever produced. Hirak Rajar Deshe reminds all -every time an evil king attempts to exploit the farmers, the labourers and the rest of the very people who make the kingdom a kingdom of diamonds, the common man will rise in rebellion. Time for all @MamataOfficial to heed and be accountable,” Dhankhar tweeted on Tuesday morning.Though the tweet and the trolls that it triggered did not surprise anyone, politicians and the intelligentsia questioned the constitutional limits of Raj Bhawan. Even those who did not entirely disagree with the spirit of Dhankhar’s imagery found in it a reflection of the turf war between TMC and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Prof Amal Kumar Mukhopadhyay, a political commentator and former principal of Presidency College, questioned Dhankhar’s role as a critic.“I am rather surprised. The governor is the Constitutional head of the state and he should not have made this kind of a comment,” Mukhopadhyay said.“West Bengal is in a bad shape and the government has totally failed to combat the situation. There are agitations in many places. The government cannot escape its responsibility. We think that it is a kind of Hirak Rajar Deshe but the governor should not have made such a comment,” he added.The Congress, which has lost substantial ground in West Bengal to the TMC, saw the tussle between the state and Raj Bhawan as a superficial one even as it described it as a “police state.”“Dhankhar’s statements are politically tilted but all we see is TMC making counter statements. If the TMC seriously feels that the governor is not playing his Constitutional role why hasn’t it met the President of India yet?” Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the leader of the Congress in the Lok Sabha and Berhampore MP, asked.“When the Congress opposed actions by the governors in Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Maharashtra it met the President. If the Bengal governor’s chair is being abused such a meeting is mandatory,” Chowdhury said.Economist Indraneel Dasgupta of the Indian Statistical Institute minced no words while describing Dhankhar’s statements as “too directly political.”“A governor should not be doing this. If he is unhappy with any action of the state, he can always ask for a report or seek greater consultation with Raj Bhawan. As a private citizen, I may agree or disagree with another citizen’s political posturing but a governor cannot take a politically partisan stance,” said Dasgupta.“There is no rule of law in India and Bengal is no different. But what we are witnessing is akin to a representative of the king narrating the story of the queen,” quipped CPI(M) politburo member Md Salim.The BJP’s state leadership feels that Dhankhar has done no wrong so far and all his actions are aimed at ensuring the welfare of the people.“Nobody can blame Raj Bhawan of raising issues that are not related to well being of citizens. History shows that even dictatorial forces can come to power through a democratic process. This was noted by the makers of our constitution. Hence, they kept the provisions of Section 355 and 356 (central rule),” Jay Prakash Majumdar, the BJP’s state vice-president, said.Reacting to the TMC’s allegation that the governor speaks the language of the BJP, Majumdar said, “Has the governor said anything so far that the Congress and the Left parties have not? Those who criticise him should get the substance of his statements.”Suvashis Maitra, columnist and political observer, pointed out the political nature of Dhankhar’s comments.“The governor’s statements, right from the time he took over, have been politically sensitive and the relationship between Raj Bhawan and the government is getting worse every day. Opposition parties may find this amusing but it is the constitutional system that is being ridiculed. This is not good for citizens,” Maitra said.No TMC leader was willing to comment on records on Tuesday’s tweet by Dhankhar. “The Raj Bhawan, as we said earlier, is an extended office of the BJP,” a senior cabinet minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/oppn-intelligentsia-question-raj-bhawan-s-role-as-dhankhar-compares-bengal-to-satyajit-ray-s-satire-on-dictatorship/story-TiCHyG7J8mBFl8oxT7C49M.html

17-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi records 93 deaths in 24 hrs; 344 more added to toll after review||The Capital added 437 deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as per the Delhi government’s daily health bulletin on Tuesday, of these, 93 took place over 24 hours pertaining to the report. Most of the other 344 fatalities that were added to the toll, were deaths that took place over all of June, with a few deaths from earlier.So far, 1,837 people in Delhi have died of the infection.The mortality rate in the city rose to 4.1%. In comparison, the national mortality rate stands at 3.3%.The sudden increase in the number of deaths has had the chief minister’s office raise a query with the Directorate General of Health Services to find out the cause for the same. A three-member death audit committee reviews the case sheets, investigations, and death summary before declaring a death as Covid-19 death.A senior official from Delhi’s health department said the increase in the number of deaths was a result of the death review committee’s efforts over the last four days to go through all previous mails and add the deaths.“Some of the deaths were missed out as a result of clerical and technological errors – such as attachments not opening, some e-mail getting missed among the bulk, or the wifi not working,” said the official.Delhi also recorded 1,859 new cases of Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking the total number of cases in the city to 44,688. With the number of Covid-19 tests in the Capital increasing to 7,786 on Tuesday, the positivity rate – the number of people who tested positive among those tested – has come down to almost 24%. The Delhi government has directed its deputy commissioners, directorate of health services, and the chief district medical officers to collect more than 10,000 samples as part of the government’s efforts to ramp up Covid-19 testing in the city. HT had reported this on Tuesday.On Tuesday, the Delhi government also directed the medical directors of all Covid-19 hospitals to issue a certificate on discharge from the hospitals. According to order by Vikram Dev Dutt, principal secretary health, the discharge certificate has to say, “This is to certify that I have examined …… He/She has recovered from Covid and does not pose a risk to the community. He/She is asymptomatic at the time of discharge.”This is on the lines of ‘immunity passports’ for people who have recovered to return to work, which the World Health Organization has previously warned against as there is no evidence to suggest that people who have recovered are protected from a second infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-records-93-deaths-in-24-hrs-344-more-added-to-toll-after-review/story-rnICWok2vxY1F5pZxtm3KN.html

17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Pre-monsoons likely to hit Chandigarh next week||Pre-monsoon showers in the city are just a week away as per the India Meteorological Department (IMD), with the monsoon also set to keep its date with the city and likely to arrive around two days before the expected date of June 30.As per IMD Delhi, the monsoon had advanced into more parts of Madhya Pradesh and eastern Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday, though it was expected to happen around June 20. Chandigarh IMD director Surender Paul said, “Monsoon is approaching faster than normal due to prevalent pressure systems. It seems likely that monsoon will arrive in the region, including Chandigarh, Haryana and western parts of Punjab, around two days before June 30.”About pre-monsoons, Paul said, “They usually start around three days before onset of monsoon. But this year, they are likely to start even sooner. We can expect pre-monsoon showers around five days before monsoon’s arrival. Their intensity is likely to be higher than last year owing to the confluence of western disturbances and low-level easterly winds with the monsoon winds.”According to IMD, monsoon rains are expected to be at 107% of the normal 845.7mm estimate, expected between June 1 and September 30, which are considered monsoon months. Mercury continues to riseMeanwhile, the city is currently facing a dry spell, with the maximum temperature reaching the 40 degrees Celsius mark again. Paul said the maximum temperature can rise as high as 42 degrees in the coming days. “A western disturbance is likely to affect the region from Saturday onwards, so light rain can be expected, but it won’t be considered pre-monsoon showers,” he added.On Tuesday, the maximum temperature went up to 40.4 degrees from 40 degrees on Monday, which was two notches above normal. The minimum temperature also rose from 29.6 degrees on Monday to 30 degrees on Tuesday, which was the first time this year that it touched the 30 degree mark. This was five degrees above normal.

17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Audit body asks Chandigarh education dept to explain advance increments paid to 114 teachers against UGC norms||The director-general of audit has sought clarifications from the Chandigarh education department regarding payment of advance increments to 114 teachers in city colleges, including principal of Post Graduate Government College (PGGC), Sector 11, Rama Arora.Raising red flags, the audit party has prepared an ‘advance para’ regarding “irregular and inadmissible grant of advance increments in violation of University Grants Commission (UGC) norms” and has asked the department to furnish a reply within three weeks.It is pertinent to mention that two days after receiving the letter on May 27, director of higher education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, formed a committee to furnish the reply which interestingly, Arora is a member of.The audit department noted that Arora was granted three non-compounding advance increments based on her PhD degree in Physics. However, her concerning work was in mathematics in contravention to UGC regulations.The audit para further said that “Records indicated that she attended the course at Punjabi University, Patiala, from 4pm to 6pm and was simultaneously present in PGGC, Sector 11.”Further, no documentary evidence regarding process of admission, registration, course work and external evaluation was found on records regarding Arora’s PhD, the audit para cites.The records further indicate that similar discrepancies were also found in cases of 114 other assistant professors. In fact, show-cause notices were also issued to all of them asking why their PhD increment should not be withdrawn as they do not fulfill any conditions laid down in UGC regulations of 2010. The matter is also pending with ministry of human resource development and UGC for over a year.The audit department noted that “The financial implications at this stage cannot be ascertained as the payment is incremental and being paid till date.” However, it is estimated that the overall loss to the exchequer could be around Rs 40 crore.The audit party has asked the education department to justify the objections raised and quantify the amount paid to Arora and the other assistant professors.Arun Kumar Gupta, education secretary said he “needs to check” whereas director of school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, said, “The report of the committee and reply to show cause notices will be submitted to the audit party.”Rama Arora refused to entertain any queries. However, on her involvement as a committee member, when she is named in audit para, Brar replied, “She is engaged as a principal of PGGC 11 not as a professor. She would rescue from signing the report.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/audit-body-asks-chandigarh-education-dept-to-explain-advance-increments-paid-to-114-teachers-against-ugc-norms/story-nfLNUlGF0apABOEAVshwVI.html

17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Disclosure of income doesn’t invade privacy of schools: Chandigarh admn to HC||The Chandigarh administration has told the Punjab and Haryana high court that disclosure of income and expenditure of schools on their websites doesn’t amount to invasion of their privacy and would not be violation of any rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India.The administration has termed these schools ‘public entities’ as they have been established on government land and has argued that they are bound to follow directions issued by the administration from time to time with regard to fee regulation.The response was submitted in a plea filed by private schools’ association challenging the order asking schools to upload balance sheets on their websites. The Independent Schools’ Association has also challenged constitution of Fee Regulatory Authority constituted under the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act that was adopted by UT in 2018.The Chandigarh administration has reasoned that the law was adopted with some amendments with an intent to advance transparency and accountability which are the essential features of the mechanism to be provided for fee regulation. Moreover, the law was enacted following high court’s direction to regulate fee and save parents from whimsical decisions of private schools in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, the administration told the court. UT has argued that schools were asked to upload balance sheets in consonance with provisions of the law and upon complaints of profiteering and some parents seeking waiver of fee in the wake of Covid-19 outbreak. Many of them did not upload balance sheets and did not respond to the show cause notice served to them for failing to comply with the order, the administration said. But, they chose to challenge it here, UT has told court demanding that petition be dismissed and they be asked to approach competent authority in UT with their grievance, if any. The matter will be taken up on Wednesday again.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/disclosure-of-income-doesn-t-invade-privacy-of-schools-chandigarh-admn-to-hc/story-pw7vLpHBZAqWKNH295jGKN.html

Ruing that the price of petrol increased by Rs 1.03 per litre and that of diesel by Rs 1.47 on Tuesday, members of the Ludhiana Petrol Pump Dealers Association are contemplating to launch an agitation against the government. Prices of petrol and diesel on Tuesday were Rs 78.40 and Rs 69.54 per litre respectively. President of the Ludhiana Petrol Pump Dealers Association, Ranjit Singh Gandhi, said, “The government did not even provide relief when crude oil prices were at an all-time low during lockdown. It is a two-fold blow to petrol pump owners as the demand is already low due to lockdown and, with this increase in the price, the neighbouring states with low rates, will attract more customers. Both Union and state governments are not paying heed to the problem being faced a common man, but the government is interested in only collecting taxes.”Gandhi said petrol pump owners are contemplating to launch an agitation in the coming days in association with industry and transport sectors.“At a time when the government should provide essentials to residents at low rates, the government has increased the prices of fuel, which would result in inflation due to rise in the transportation cost,” said Gandhi. Chairman of the association Ashok Sachdeva said, “The sector has already been hit hard due to lockdown since March and the announcement of weekend lockdown now has added to their woes, as sales have gone down to around 10-15% on weekends. The government needs to review its policy as a common man needs a relief at this time of crisis.”‘DOUBLE WHAMMY’ FOR TRANSPORTERSReeling under losses due to low demand, transporters rued that the government has added to their woes by increasing the price of diesel by Rs 10 per litre during the lockdown period.President of the Ludhiana Goods Transport Association Didar Singh said, “The demand is low as the factories are not being run at full capacity and we are also facing shortage of labour. It is a double whammy for the transporters as we had to reduce the transportation charges/fare due to low demand and competition in the market, but the input cost is increasing every day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/diesel-price-hits-all-time-high-ludhiana-petrol-pump-owners-transporters-cry-foul/story-xGQVrhZy1r4W2nVEPJfYSI.html

17-06-2020||Chandigarh||1,048 bottles of spurious sanitiser confiscated in Ludhiana||At a time when people are living under the fear of Covid-19 and forced to buy facemasks and sanitisers, some unscrupulous elements are using the challenging time as an opportunity to con people by selling spurious sanitisers.A team, led by Zonal Licensing Authority (Drugs) Kulwinder Singh, seized 1,048 bottles of spurious sanitiser being sold in the market on Tuesday. While the accused, identified as Lavish Kumar Grover, managed to escape, the team managed to seize the consignment of spurious sanitiser and the Ford Endeavour SUV, in which the accused had come to deliver the consignment.It is learnt that Grover, who is already facing charges of selling spurious health supplements, was selling the sanitiser by claiming to be an agent of the company concerned.ZLA Kulwinder Singh said the seizure was made following a trap laid by the owner of the firm on whose brand name the accused was selling the spurious hand sanitiser.“On the basis of a complaint received from the proprietor of the firm, M/s Ron and Baker, Ambala, Haryana, regarding the sale of spurious product, Medshield hand sanitiser of his company, a team comprising drug control officers (DCOs) Rupinder Kaur and Rooppreet Kaur, conducted a raid on a site opposite the Malhi Farm, Haibowal Kalan, and seized 1,048 bottles of spurious hand sanitiser,” said Kulwinder Singh.Kulwinder Singh added proprietor of the firm, Ron Baker, Sunil Dutt, had received complaints that one Lavish Kumar was selling spurious hand sanitisers of Dutt’s company and, by doing so, he was spoiling the image of his company.Sunil Dutt pursued the matter and posed himself as a decoy customer and, on his demand, Lavish Grover came on SUV for delivery of spurious sanitiser opposite the Malhi Farm.As Lavish parked his SUV, Sunil Dutt parked his vehicle behind that of Lavish, so that he could not flee in the vehicle when caught.In the meantime, the team raided the site and, on seeing the team, Lavish Grover fled leaving behind the sanitiser bottles and his SUV. Two types of drug sanitisers (total 32 bottles) were taken for test and analysis. Besides a total of 1,016 x 120 ml units of spurious sanitiser were recovered.Kulwinder Singh, said, “The recovered product is imitation of the original product, Medshield. Its label bears the name of company, M/s Ron and Baker, but actually it is not the product of the firm as per the statement and complaint of proprietor of Ron and Baker, Sunil Dutt.”Lavish Kumar and his accomplice Rahul were booked under Section 17-B of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act 1940 and the matter was referred to police for registration of an FIR under section 17-B read with Section 36 AC of the said Act, said Kulwinder Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/1-048-bottles-of-spurious-sanitiser-confiscated-in-ludhiana/story-9a9cL453xWI8R93LOSpKVO.html

Koshyari visited Patankar’s home, which is located at Kalanagar in Bandra (East), near Thackeray’s residence Matoshree.The development comes amid reports of an ongoing tussle between the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and the Governor on a series of issues.On June 2, the Governor took strong objections over the CM’s decision to scrap the final-year exams for universities this year owing to the coronavirus outbreak. Koshyari said the CM’s announcement on the exams was “unprecedented’ and made “without any profound thinking” on legal repercussions. He also asserted that he is the chancellor of all the universities and the final authority, as far as the affairs of the universities is concerned and so the decision over exams will be taken in consonance with the provisions of the Maharashtra Public Universities Act.Prior to the issue of university exams, MVA government criticised the Governor for the delay in nominating Uddhav Thackeray as a Member of Legislative Council (MLC), despite a request by the state cabinet to avoid constitutional crisis in Maharashtra. Koshyari also did not appointed Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders Shivajirao Garje and Aditi Nalawade as members of the state legislative Council despite the two being recommended by CM in December last year.

17-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga led to damages worth ₹15 lakh in Maharashtra’s Phansad sanctuary||Cyclone Nisarga has been responsible for ₹15 lakh worth damages to the Phansad Wildlife Sanctuary located across Murud and Roha talukas of Raigad district. According to the Maharashtra forest department, on June 3 the severe cyclone damaged several rest houses after trees fell on them while rooftops of huts and entire tents, used as tourist accommodations, were blown away.The 69.79-sq km sanctuary, located in the Western Ghats, will remain shut for tourists due to restoration work, till the end of July. With the onset of the southwest monsoon and heavy rain over the south Konkan district, restoration is currently on hold. Forest officers said June and July were busy months with high tourist footfall for trekking and birding, which is likely to affect tourism revenue for the year.“Phansad witnessed maximum tree fall cases among any other protected area along Konkan due to the cyclone. The office headquarters building witnessed minor damages, with portions of the roof blown away, but no impact on the foundation. However, branches and barks of large trees have fallen on adjacent rest houses and huts. Tin roofs of major structures were damaged due to gusty winds,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife west), Maharashtra forest department, who visited the sanctuary on Monday. In comparison, the 12.11-sqkm Karnala Bird Sanctuary in Panvel did not sustain any major damages and minimal tree fall was reported there, said Limaye.Though 20 forest staff were present at the sanctuary on June 3 when the cyclone made landfall, no injuries or fatalities were reported. “We have no reports yet of animals sustaining injuries either but owing to hundreds of tree fall incidents mostly for mango, ficus, ain, teak, etc, bird nests have been affected the most since this was their nesting season,” Limaye said, adding, “However, damages within a fraction of the sanctuary have been assessed so far, since most roads are blocked due to fallen trees. We will get more information in the coming days after restoration.”Similar to the rest of the district, there has been no electricity at the sanctuary since June 3. “We have been informed that power will be restored within the next eight to 10 days,” he said.Meanwhile, residents of nearby Supe village have been assisting the forest staff in mending damages to affected structures. “We have issued clear instructions for forest officers not to venture out during heavy rains due to the presence of predatory leeches that are in abundance during monsoon,” Limaye said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-led-to-damages-worth-15-lakh-in-maharashtra-s-phansad-sanctuary/story-6SW98JeTUcLAaVlqayL7VN.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Weather bureau issues warning, brace for heavy rain in Mumbai today||The city witnessed moderate showers, but negligible rainfall was recorded in the suburbs despite partly cloudy conditions on Tuesday – two days after the onset of monsoon in the city was declared.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) retained an orange alert for Tuesday in its updated district-wise forecast issued at 1pm. It issued heavy rain warning for Wednesday, but downgraded the forecast to light to moderate showers for Thursday and Friday.Between Tuesday, 8.30am and 8.30pm, the Colaba weather station recorded – representative of south Mumbai – recorded 13.8mm rainfall, while the Santacruz weather station – representative of the suburbs – recorded 0.8 mm rainfall. However, in 24 hours (between Monday 8.30am and Tuesday 8.30am), south Mumbai recorded 52.6mm rainfall, while the suburbs recorded 37.4mm rainfall, both falling under the ‘rather heavy’ category.IMD classifies 2.5mm - 7.5 mm as light rain, 7.6 mm - 35.5 mm as moderate rain, 35.6 mm - 64.4 mm as rather heavy rain, and 64.5 - 124.4 mm as heavy rain.IMD director-general Mrutyunjay Mohapatra explained that associated weather systems, enhancing the monsoon current, had weakened. “The low pressure area that had developed off Bay of Bengal towards the east coast lost intensity as it moved over the central parts of the country. The orange alert is always issued to ensure the city is prepared in case of heavy rain. We expect monsoon currents to strengthen as another low pressure system is expected to develop over Bay of Bengal by June 19. Meanwhile, the monsoon current is stronger over south Konkan, and may enhance rain activity over north Konkan, including Mumbai on Wednesday,” said Mohapatra.Private weather forecasters Skymet, which had also predicted heavy to very heavy rainfall for Monday and Tuesday, said the offshore trough (weather system) did not intensify and its impact remained confined to south Konkan and Goa. “We expect moderate to heavy showers (60-70mm) on Wednesday, with a further reduction in intensity on Thursday of 20-30mm,” said Mahesh Palawat, vice-president (meteorology and climate change), Skymet.Independent meteorologists said heavy rain alerts for a city like Mumbai must be issued only when there is a high confidence in model predictions. “Alerts need to specifically mention whether the expected heavy rain is going to be persistent or transient due to thunderstorms. In such a critical scenario, daily heavy rainfall alerts or forecasts can distract the local administration which is dealing with the Covid-19 outbreak,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom.Deoras added that showers were expected to increase in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region on Wednesday. “Compared to Monday and Tuesday, rain intensity on Wednesday expected to be more persistent due to the proximity of a localised circulation (a weather system). Since monsoon has arrived, the usual intermittent shower pattern will be seen in Mumbai on Thursday and Friday,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/weather-bureau-issues-warning-brace-for-heavy-rain-in-mumbai-today/story-nHP9O8sfWMnmnLSbIk3gKL.html

The MSP decided by the government for the crop is Rs 1,760 per quintal and the maximum market price is Rs 1,200, leading to heavy losses to the farmers as they are bound to sell in the market in the absence of government purchase,” he said.“The crop is grown in large areas of the district and farmers here have mostly grown this crop after the government asked them to grow maize as an alternative to rice, so the farmers here are the most affected. We have given an ultimatum to the government to buy the crop or face protests,” Charuni said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/maize-procurement-farmers-body-warns-of-stir-if-govt-fails-to-buy-their-produce/story-tvC3gTzVZGVsEoq3N87yQM.html

17-06-2020||City||With new permit, industrial units can start within 48 hours in Maharashtra||Facing economic crisis due to the pandemic and ensuing lockdown, Maharashtra is all set to roll out the red carpet to attract investment. The state has planned to provide ‘Maha Parwana’, a master permission for new industrial units, within 48 hours of application, so that they won’t need any other permission and can start construction on the site immediately. The draft of the policy is likely to be cleared by the state cabinet in a week, officials said. “In a week, we will be able to start ‘Maha Parwana’ for new investors. It is a master permission that will be provided within 48 hours of the application. Every company can start construction work immediately after obtaining ‘Maha Parwana’. The master permission guarantees that all statutory permissions required to start operations will be delivered within a prescribed schedule (from three to 30 days), otherwise it will be considered a deemed approval,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity. An investor requires at least 22 permissions to start operations in the state. The Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC) is also looking at changing its land lease policy to offer land to investors on rent to bring down their capital investments. Only companies that require environmental clearance won’t be able to start the construction activities, he clarified.This decision comes as on the heels of the Magnetic Maharashtra 2.0, the global investors’ summit hosted by the state and inaugurated by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday. Besides, the industries department will be appointing a relationship manager on the lines of private banks to interact with investors on a regular basis. “This will help reduce the communication gap between both the sides and all their issues can be resolved in no time,” said another official.Senior IAS officer Bhushan Gagrani, who is appointed as a state coordination officer to attract new investment in Maharashtra, said they have started communicating with global CEOs, MDs and directors and so far have communicated with 400 global companies. “Overall, the global sentiment is not very encouraging due to obvious reasons, so they may take some time to respond, but as a state we have indicated that let’s get back to business,” Gagrani said. “Currently, the land lease model is only for 95 years. But the problem is many companies are not keen on upfront capital investment due to changing global conditions. So MIDC is preparing to give them land on a rental basis, as per their requirement. They are preparing packages, which will bring down the capital investment,” Gagrani said.While unveiling its road map for Magnetic Maharashtra 2.0, Thackeray said his government will ensure industries won’t face any difficulty. The state also inked 12 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) worth ₹16,300 crore during the event.The ongoing financial crisis has led the state government to declare a 67% cut in its spending for developmental works this fiscal year, in view of the estimated revenue losses of more than ₹40,000 crore in March and April owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-new-permit-industrial-units-can-start-within-48-hours-in-maharashtra/story-fV66mVEkYEnsnyem1F7N1K.html
17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Every patient in home quarantine under watch in Haryana||Infected persons under home quarantine in Haryana better stay put in their homes as their movements are being tracked round the clock to prevent them from spreading the disease.An asymptomatic infected person or those having mild symptoms are eligible for home isolation, as per the Union health ministry guidelines. However, keeping a tab on the movements of such patients and making sure they adhere to strict self-isolation at all times remains a continuous challenge.Using the mobile phone location data and satellite-based global positioning system (GPS), the Covid Quarantine Alert System (CQAS) notifies the enforcement authorities every time a Covid-19 patient under watch makes a violation. The tracking system works even if the patient has not installed Aarogya Setu app on his mobile device.Every day, the state government receives hundreds of alerts from National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) about Covid-19 patients and their primary contacts breaching the geo-fence, a virtual perimeter around a geographical location.“The alerts from NDMA are received several times a day and conveyed to the district authorities. Such patients are then approached – by cops making telephone calls as well doing physical checks – to drive home the point that they just cannot violate home isolation protocol,” said a top official.Additional chief secretary (health) Rajeev Arora said the use of technology in tracking the patients and making hotspot predictions is imperative to their efforts to break the chain of transmission.National Health Mission (NHM) director Prabhjot Singh explained that the authorities record the home latitude and longitude of Covid-19 patients put under home isolation to monitor their movements.“Once a person jumps the quarantine and breaches the 300-metre radius of geo-fence, the violation gets logged using the mobile tower location data. Subsequently, the system triggers an alarm to the authorities on the basis of mobile device location of the patient,” Singh said.Officials said on being diagnosed as a confirmed or suspected coronavirus patient, every person put in home isolation has to give an undertaking that he or she will be liable to be acted upon as per the prescribed law for any non-adherence to self-isolation protocol. Such persons are required to maintain strict self-isolation at all times for the prescribed period. During this period, they are required to monitor their health and those around them, interact with the surveillance team or call centre number 1075 if their health deteriorates or any of their close family contacts develop any influenza-like illness symptoms.HISTORY TRACKER AND HOTSPOT PREDICTORThe state government is also using another web-based platform ITIHAAS to check the travel history of infected patients as well as identify potential hotspots. “The ITIHAAS system uses mobile tower locations to find out how much time an infected patient or a person having influenza-like symptoms has spent in a particular area. This helps us make projections about an upcoming hotspot. Subsequently, we initiate intensive house-to-house surveillance in that area to check the spread of infection,” the NHM chief said.BREACH GEO-FENCE, GET CAUGHTUsing the power under the Indian Telegraph Act, the NDMA tracks the mobile phones of Covid-19 patients and their primary contactsThe state government invokes Section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act to gain access to a patient’s mobile phone data in the interest of public safetyThe standard operating procedure for tracking the mobile device allows data collection for Covid management only.The mobile number has to be erased from the tracking system once the requirement of location monitoring is over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/every-patient-in-home-quarantine-under-watch-in-haryana/story-7eosg8eQvyflEKylx95BPJ.html

17-06-2020||City||Shiv Sena-Congress tiff out in the open?||The unease between the Shiv Sena and Congress, allies in the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi-ruled state government, is likely to escalate in the coming days, with Sena mouthpiece Saamana taking an aggressive stand to remind the ruling partner that their grumbling was uncalled for, as the Sena, too, has made sacrifices while stitching together the alliance.The editorial comes after state Congress chief and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat last week said that party leaders would meet chief minister Uddhav Thackeray with their grievances. He had said the Congress expects equal importance in decision-making in the MVA government. Before the statement, key Congress leaders held two meetings last week and deliberated upon the alleged secondary treatment.The Congress leadership feels the bureaucracy is dominating the decisions. “Many proposals, including those related to the energy or relief and rehabilitation departments held by the Congress, were moved without the knowledge of the ministers. We have taken the issue to the chief minister, but no corrective action was taken,” said a senior Congress leader. Thorat and public works minister and former chief minister Ashok Chavan have been asking for an appointment with Thackeray to discuss the issue, but the latter has reportedly paid no heed.According to Congress leaders, the discontent is over three issues. The party is against the third extension for chief secretary Ajoy Mehta after his term ends on June 30 and wants the nominations to the legislative Council from the Governor’s quota to be sent at the earliest. The party is also batting for an additional seat in the Council. The discontent is also out of the feeling that Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar is being given too much audience by the CM.While Sena leader Sanjay Raut on Tuesday dismissed rumours of discontent within the MVA, the Saamana editorial likened the Congress to an “old squeaky charpoy”, which is groaning under the leaders’ “historical inheritance”. CM Uddhav Thackeray’s wife, Rashmi, is the editor of Saamana, while Raut is its executive editor. Saamana editorials are considered the view of the Sena leadership. “There is no discontent or discord between the allies. Such words should not be used. The decisions happen in the cabinet meetings. All three parties are given respect,” Raut said. Twelve seats to the Council are vacant and are to be nominated by the Governor on the recommendation of the state government. The editorial said the seats must be divided on the basis of the coalition partners’ strength in the legislative Assembly. The Sena has 64 members, including eight independents, while the NCP and Congress have 54 and 44, respectively. “The Sena has sacrificed the most in this power-sharing. It had to give one ministerial berth to the NCP when Pawar objected to the Congress occupying the Assembly Speaker’s post,” the editorial said. “Two additional cabinet berths were also given to the Congress, instead of the posts of minister of state… Both Thorat and Chavan have a long experience in governance. They should remember that even Pawar is experienced in administration, but there are no complaints from his party. There was a consensus that CM Thackeray’s decision would be final and Pawar, too, abides by this rule,” it said.“We have been seeking the chief minister’s appointment as we have certain issues related to public interest that need to be discussed with the CM. I am sure after hearing us out, even he will admit that the issues were serious in nature. The editorial was written on the basis of inadequate information and I am sure there will be another editorial endorsing our stand,” said Thorat.Raut defended the editorial. “This is our signature style of writing. I’ve read the interview with Ashok Chavan. If he has any concerns, he should speak to the CM. This is not a clash between the administration and government. Maharashtra is facing two major issues – Covid-19 and Cyclone Nisarga,” he told the media.The write-up also took a potshots regarding complaints about bureaucracy. “There are complaints about the workings of state chief secretary Ajoy Mehta and Nagpur municipal commissioner Tukaram Mundhe. But no matter how ‘big’ an officer is, he has to go by the decision of the chief minister as he is a public servant …,” it said.Raut said the government is not run by the secretaries, but by ministers. “It is not called Sachivalaya (secretariat), but Mantralaya now. There is no question of any resentment as the Congress is an experienced party. The CM will meet them as is the practice in the coalition government,” he said.The editorial, however, said there was no threat to the coalition government. In a sarcastic reference to the covert formation of the 80-hour government by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) with support of NCP’s Ajit Pawar, it said, “Nobody should remain under this illusion that there is a threat to the government and the gates of Raj Bhavan would open early in the morning once again for someone.”Raju Shetti accepts NCP’s Council seatSwabhimani Shetakari Sanghtana (SSS) leader Raju Shetti, who once rattled Sharad Pawar’s politics by holding protests at Baramati, visited his house in Govidbaug on Tuesday and accepted NCP’s offer of a seat in the Council. “I have accepted the offer for Council polls,” said Shetti, after his two-and-half hour long meeting with Pawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/shiv-sena-congress-tiffout-in-the-open/story-rH88glNdiPB0M0c1rt76EL.html

17-06-2020||Chandigarh||PM’s meeting with CMs Set up group for coordinated Centre-state response to revive economy: Amarinder||Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Tuesday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to set up a group, which should include a few chief ministers, to discuss and formulate a coordinated centre-state response to the devastating impact of Covid-19 on the economy and governments across the country.Amarinder made the suggestion during a video conference held by the Prime Minister with the chief ministers of several states. The CM requested that the Centre should work closely with the states to ease the distress caused by the pandemic and the subsequent lockdown.Calling for urgent steps to mitigate Punjab’s financial stress, Amarinder said a detailed memorandum had already been sent to the Centre, listing out the impact of Covid-19 and also seeking fiscal and non-fiscal assistance. Even as he thanked the Prime Minister and Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for the release of GST payment of around ₹2,800 crore in early June, the CM said while he appreciated that the central government was also under financial stress, he had to request for release of the state’s pending share of taxes to tide over the fiscal crisis. “The crisis in Punjab is likely to be acute with a shortfall of ₹25,000-30,000 crore in revenue collection on various counts,” he said.Pointing to the centre’s decision to allow reforms-linked increase in borrowing limits under FRBM Act from 3 to 5%, the chief minister requested the PM to relook at some of the conditionalities, given the situation on the ground. The borrowing was a loan that states have to repay and not a grant by GoI, he said.‘PM TELLS STATES TO ADOPT PUNJAB’S COVID COMBAT MODEL’The state government, in a statement, said that the Prime Minister appreciated Punjab’s Covid micro-containment and house-to-house surveillance strategy and asked all other states to adopt the model. The PM intervened as Amarinder was describing the state’s model to combat Covid, it said.Amarinder said the state government was working on a multi-pronged strategy to fight the pandemic. The focus was currently on micro-containment strategy to isolate small mohallas or village wards rather than close down larger areas, he said, adding that a special app had also been launched for house-to-house surveillance to detect any possible cases and persons with co-morbidities to catch high-risk patients early.The CM also emphasised the need for more tests, requesting the PM to direct GoI institutions in Chandigarh and Punjab to increase testing capacity. On the state’s preparedness to tackle further spread of the pandemic, he informed the meeting that 5,000 isolation beds were ready in government Level 2 and 3 facilities, in addition to 10-15,000 beds in Level 1 covid care centres for mild patients. “These Level 1 beds can be scaled to 30,000, if the need arises,” he said, adding, “For tertiary level care, the state government has also secured the participation of private hospitals”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pm-s-meeting-with-cms-set-up-group-for-coordinated-centre-state-response-to-revive-economy-amarinder/story-dgyVR42rGBH5HLVHe01BpN.html

Sources said none of these officials are locals and went back to their hometowns before public transport was stopped. All these officials have been issued memos and called for explanations on their decision to leave the work place, Mumbai. A letter dated June 12 read, “...the commissioner of customs remarked: How did these people leave station without permission? Please begin action on those who were on un-authorised leave. Also recovery from salary be done for availing dues such as travelling allowance etc. No work no pay rule be applied. Those not on leave, stop pay. Issue memo for un- authorised absence and initiated disciplinary proceedings (sic)” The letter also mentioned the names of 30 officials. HT, which has access to the list, learnt that few officials had intimated about their leave on emails, few were on sanctioned leave but could not join because of lockdown, some had informed over the phone but were not permitted to take leave, some applied for shorter leaves but extended them, while an official had gone on leave as he had lost someone in his family.However, three of the officials were listed for going on leave without permission or going on leave for few days but not resuming their duty. Principal commissioner of customs Prachi Saroop did not respond to HT. A customs official said, “The listed people had to return to their family due to the pandemic and not for leisure. It was an exceptional phase when the government kept requesting citizens to take care of their children and elderly at home. They went back for the safety of their family.” Another official said, “Most of them had informed their immediate bosses via emails or messages. Considering the extraordinary situation, disciplinary actions should not be taken in this case as the situation was uncontrolled due to the pandemic. In fact, the affected employees should now resume work and should not be marked absent. Instead they should be adjusted against their paid leaves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/30-customs-officials-face-action-not-reporting-to-work-during-lockdown/story-vy1i9rVkZSr3Yxzwg9HoHI.html
17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Amritsar teen ends life after police harassment, wanted to join the Army||AMRITSAR “Papa, I did nothing... the policemen had been lying that it (condom) was mine. I don’t know how and from where it came. And you also believed... the policemen… I don’t want your... disrespect because of me… Please take care of my mother and yourself, and don’t drink,” reads the note written by an 18-year-old who died by suicide at his Amritsar home on Monday.The teenager ended his life, his family alleged, after being harassed by two assistant sub inspectors of Amritsar police, Davinder Singh and Sham Lal, who had stopped him while he was on his scooter for not wearing a helmet, and later falsely accused him of carrying a condom. They treated him as if he was a hardcore criminal and lectured his father on morality, it was alleged. “He was a student of Class 12 and had also joined the National Cadet Corps (NCC). He had been working hard to fulfil his dream to join the Army and serve the nation, but it was shattered by the policemen,” his mother said.The teenager is survived by his father,who runs a scrap shop, mother and two younger sisters. The family migrated to the city from Uttar Pradesh 20 years back.His family members said he was out on his scooter on Friday when Davinder Singh and Sham Lal stopped him for not wearing a helmet and took him to the Sun City police post under the Mohkampura police station.The father of the deceased said when he heard about the incident he went to the police post. “The two policemen had detained my son there. I gave them Rs 500 to release my son and his scooter as I was told that he was challaned for not wearing a helmet. Before getting my son released, the cops showed me a condom and told me that they had recovered it from my son’s scooter. They scolded me and my son as if he was a hardcore criminal. The next day, one of the two policemen came to my shop, taking Rs 500 extra for releasing the scooter’s registration papers.” The teenager had been depressed because of the false allegations, his father said, and had stopped eating. “On Monday, when I was at the shop and my wife and daughter had gone to the market for buying vegetables my son committed suicide by hanging,” he said.The grieving relatives protested outside Mohkampura police station on Tuesday from 11 am to 2 pm demanding registration of a case against the two ASIs. The president of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD)’s migrant wing Mahesh Verma also demanded the arrest of the policemen and said more protests would follow if the family’s demands were not met.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP-City3) Harpal Singh said the ASIs had been suspended. “We have also sent a report to dismiss both from the department.” After the departmental action criminal action would also be initiated against the policemen, he added.If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

17-06-2020||Mumbai||HC imposes ₹5-lakh cost on petitioner seeking free Covid-19 treatment for all||The Bombay high court has imposed a cost of ₹5 lakh on an educationist who had sought directions to the state to bear the cost of treatment for all Covid patients across all hospitals in the state. The court observed that it was preposterous to seek such directions at a time when the entire nation was struggling to combat and contain the spread of the virus.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice K K Tated, while hearing a couple of public interest litigations (PIL) filed by Sagar Jondhale, an educationist and Sarika Singh, a resident of Kurla was informed that the May 21 government notification which stipulated that 80% of beds in private hospitals was insufficient to alleviate the problems of a common man as they could not afford the cost of treatment. The petitions had prayed that the government should be directed to provide free-of-cost Covid-19 treatment at all hospitals, including private institutions, across Maharashtra. Advocate Anand Jondhale for Sagar Jondhale and advocate Varsha Jagdale for Sarika Singh had argued that though the notification had requisitioned 80% of beds in private hospitals and nursing homes for treatment of Covid-19 patients in the absence of any clear orders on the charges that the hospitals could recover from patients was resulting in profiteering by the said private hospitals. The advocates submitted that the notification allowed the hospitals to charge separately for pharmacy and pathology services which were affecting the patients, hence sought the notification to be declared null and void. In light of these submissions, the petitioners sought directions to the state government to provide free-of-cost Covid-19 treatment to all citizens in all hospitals, including private institutions, except to those who are covered by insurance schemes. Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni along with government pleader Poornima Kantharia, however, submitted that due to the magnitude of Covid cases, the prayers of the petitioners were unfounded as the state could not be expected to pay for their treatment. Kumbhakoni further submitted that the state was taking all measures to ensure that testing and treatment for Covid was available to everyone, hence the demand for free of cost treatment by the petitioners was misplaced and the PILs should be dismissed with costs. After hearing the submissions, the court observed that as the demands of the petitioners were frivolous and preposterous. Hence, the court dismissed the PIL filed by Jondhale and directed him to deposit ₹5 lakh with the state government as costs. The court then asked Singh whether she wanted to withdraw her PIL and posted the matter for hearing on June 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-imposes-5-lakh-cost-on-petitioner-seeking-free-covid-19-treatment-for-all/story-p4zpd0MDpATZxRt2bMIJgJ.html
17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Regulator raps PSPCL for failing to bring down distribution losses||The Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission (PSERC) has come down heavily on the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) for failing to meet the targets to reduce the transmission and distribution losses, mainly power theft. In its tariff order for the financial year 2020-21 that was announced on June 1, the regulator noted that the power corporation failed to do the needful despite its having allowed huge capital investments for the purpose.It brought on record that against the target of distribution losses of 12.5% for the financial year 2017-18, the PSPCL recorded 14.19% losses. Also, during the financial year 2018-19, the corporation recorded distribution losses of 12.94% against the target of 11.89%, it added.In response to the regulator’s queries before finalisation of tariffs, the PSPCL referring to its provisional data up to December 31, 2019, said it registered distribution losses of 11.21% which came down by 0.31% from the corresponding period last year. Terming the figures “provisional”, the PSERC asked the corporation to identify high-loss feeders and areas and take corrective measures.‘EMPLOYEES GHERAOED AND MANHANDLED’Much to the dismay of the PSERC, the corporation reported distribution losses exceeding a whopping 25% in 12 of its distribution divisions. Of the total 109 power distribution divisions in state, 10% reported losses that the PSPCL says are beyond its control. It attributed these losses to rampant power theft.As per the energy audit for the financial year 2019-20, the divisions with huge distribution losses include Amritsar (west), Amritsar (suburban), Ajnala, Tarn Taran (city), Patti, Bikhiwind, Patran, Lehragaga, Bhagta Bhai, Zira, Baghapurana and Malout.“Surprise raids to curb power were made but the employees were gheraoed and manhandled. Rural feeders in these areas report more losses,” the PSPCL said in its reply as recorded in the tariff order.The corporation said 1.25 lakh connections were checked and 11,593 cases of theft were detected in these divisions by the end of December 2019, with the losses pegged at ₹21.87 crore. During the same period, 13.81 lakh connections were checked across the state and 1.28 lakh cases of theft were detected. A sum of ₹157.54 crore was levied as penalty.“The PSPCL submitted the loss figures (of 12 divisions) without indicating the reduction in losses achieved in these divisions during the financial year 2019- 20,” said PSERC said in its tariff order and directed the corporation to share a quarterly report on the action being taken and the status of losses achieved in these divisions.OFF THE TARGETThe divisions with huge distribution losses are Amritsar (west), Amritsar (suburban), Ajnala, Tarn Taran (city), Patti, Bikhiwind, Patran, Lehragaga, Bhagta Bhai, Zira, Baghapurana and Malout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/regulator-raps-pspcl-for-failing-to-bring-down-distribution-losses/story-kfA8GyZRt1FQLePkxHMZTJ.html
17-06-2020||Chandigarh||PGIMER doctor again courts controversy over fresh Covid projections||An additional professor at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research’s Department of Community Medicine and School of Public Health has once again courted controversy for making projections on Covid-19 cases in the country.The study which appeared on a website that publishes preliminary reports not certified by peer review was authored by Dr Shankar Prinja (first author) and seven others, and purportedly included two scientists of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). The report claimed that the peak of Covid-19 cases in India has been delayed and may now arrive around mid-November.The manuscript also claimed that the study was funded by ICMR and acknowledged the inputs of the members of National Covid Task Force on research methods.The ICMR, however, tweeted that the manuscript had been written by an author who was not their employee and that first author had admitted the “mistake”. “It is reiterated that ICMR has not funded this study, the paper was neither peer reviewed nor published and that the scientist of ICMR has not contributed to this particular study/manuscript and has also not signed the undertaking,” the medical research body tweeted.Without naming Dr Shankar Prinja, the tweet added that when questioned, the first author had accepted the mistake and withdrawn the paper. Since there was no direct involvement of ICMR in developing the manuscript, the issue of convenient withdrawal did not arise, they said.PGI BLAMES MEDIA FOR MISINTERPRETATIONOn the other hand, PGIMER has blamed the media for misinterpretation, saying it had led to the withdrawal of the study by the authors. “Dr Prinja is a member of the National Taskforce Operations Research group, duly approved by the director of PGIMER. An exercise was carried out to understand the health system preparedness of the country in view of the Covid-19 pandemic without naming who all were involved in the study,” a response from PGIMER’s public relations office stated.It added that a pre-print non-peer reviewed version was posted on a website that states any material posted should not be reported in news media as established information to guide clinical practice or policy.“The media has misinterpreted the report. As a result, the authors have withdrawn from the website,” the response further stated.PGI DOC NOT NEW TO CONTROVERSIES This is not the first time, however, that Dr Shankar Prinja has courted controversy with his assessment and projections on Covid-19 cases.On April 10, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh had claimed that 58% of the country’s population was likely to get infected with coronavirus, while quoting a PGIMER study. He had said that the infections were likely to peak by mid-September.Later, the institute had issued a press note and clarified that no such study had been carried out, to which the CM’s media advisor Raveen Thukral had said that the report cited by Captain had been authored by Dr Prinja.The institute had also served a show-cause notice to the doctor.Dr Prinja could not be contacted despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pgimer-doctor-again-courts-controversy-over-fresh-covid-projections/story-cRXuoMAB0TnanDKw0ZbtuJ.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||PTA executive panel can propose reduction of school fees: Minister||The executive committee of parent-teacher associations (PTAs) across schools in the state can propose a reduction in fees in the current situation if they feel so, said state education minister Varsha Gaikwad, while talking to the media on Tuesday afternoon.“While the government has already released strict guidelines against hiking fees, and asked schools to allow parents to make partial payments, the decision with respect to fee reduction should be taken by individual PTAs of the schools. As per the rules, the PTA executive committee has to approve fees for every year, and if parents wish, they can get their fees reduced,” said Gaikwad.According to the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011, proposals concerning fees have to be placed before the PTA executive committee for approval. The minister also said that action will be taken against schools that are still not complying with the department’s directives on not hiking fees. “We have asked our officers to take strict action against such schools,” she added. The minister said that while results of HSC (Class 12) are expected to be out by mid July, those of SSC (Class 10) will be out by July end.After several teachers from schools across the city said they were being called to work even as the standard operating procedures (SOPs) released by the department on Monday do not specifically mandate them to travel, Gaikwad said that a separate set of SOPs will be released for schools in red zones.“We are also getting several calls from teachers, especially in Mumbai, about schools asking them to report to work. We understand their concerns, and hence, to bring in more clarity, a set of guidelines specifically for schools in red zones will be issued soon,” the minister said.Officials from the education department said the guidelines are likely to be released by Wednesday. A senior official reiterated that the SOPs are binding on schools of all mediums, managements, and boards across the state.The education department has also started conducting a statewide third-party audit to understand whether online learning is reaching students and if not, the students are being given other options like phone call-based instruction from teachers, home-delivered textbooks, etc. Speaking about the concerns of private preschool educators after the government decided to ban online learning up to Class 2, Gaikwad said, “At this point not pressuring our children is more important than anything else. We hope that schools understand our compulsions in the current situation and behave in a rational and humanitarian manner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pta-executive-panel-can-propose-reduction-of-school-fees-minister/story-NJtaYtTi5qkoALY7tBZj4H.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||War rooms to camps: Medical interns’ learning is on||For the past one week, 21-year-old Divya Srinivas has been spending eight hours a day in a Covid-19 war room set by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) in Kandivli. She has spent the majority of her time arranging ambulances for Covid-positive patients and finding empty beds in hospitals after receiving frantic calls from strangers.“While the job can be stressful, what makes it worthwhile are the calls we get from the same people one day later, thanking us for helping them,” said Srinivas, a third-year student of Swami Ramanand Teerth Rural Government Medical College in Ambajogai, near Latur. “Last week we managed to transport a Covid-19 positive pregnant woman to Nair Hospital and the next day we got a call from her husband sharing news of the birth of their son. The day’s work was worth it,” she said.Many interns have been placed in BMC war rooms where they have to contact patients and answer calls received by the helpline numbers.“Working in a call centre sounds doesn’t sound like a doctor’s job but what I’m doing is very important. We help in triaging patients after informing them that they’ve tested positive for the virus, while at the same time I’ve also been helping with counseling anxious callers about symptoms and what they need to do,” said Fagun Shah, 22, a final-year MBBS student of Nair Hospital (Topiwala National Medical College).In the last week of May, management of Andheri’s Cooper Hospital (HBT Medical College) issued a circular requesting its third and fourth-year MBBS batches to return to campus and help the hospital in the ongoing Covid-19 work. Within a day, authorities of Parel’s KEM Hospital (Seth GS Medical College) and Nair Hospital (TN Medical College) also called for their second, third, and fourth-year students to join the Covid-19 workforce.Circulars signed by senior authorities of respective hospitals highlighted probable incentives of joining the workforce, including ₹30,000 honorarium per month, and that all working days will be considered as bond service that will be deducted from actual bond service in the future.“Initially many parents were apprehensive about sending undergraduate medical students in the field during a pandemic, but we realised that the students were very eager to be of any possible help. Work experience always counts for better education over what is taught in a classroom,” said Dr Ashutosh Mhatre, father of a medical intern.“Nothing beats the feeling adolescent doctors get from the compliments they receive from patients. It’s been a week that interns have joined the workforce, some in war rooms and call centres while others have volunteered for community screening programs. While the interns all seem exhausted, everyone is enjoying being in the field and getting first-hand experience of being a doctor,” said Tanmay Jadhav, spokesperson of Association of State Medical Interns (ASMI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/war-rooms-to-camps-medical-interns-learning-is-on/story-kZRk5gVh210X9d2Ne7RXgL.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Doctors expect rise in monsoon illnesses||With the arrival of monsoon, city doctors are expecting a rise in the number of dengue, malaria and swine flu (H1N1) among other seasonal ailments. Doctors are worried about anxiety among people who display symptoms such as fever and cough, which are similar to those infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.While most hospitals are currently overwhelmed due to Covid-19, hospital administrations are bracing for the annual onslaught of monsoon illnesses. Every year, around 5,000 and 1,000 people get diagnosed with malaria and dengue on an average in the city, respectively. A majority of these cases are generally reported during the monsoon months of June to September. Last year in June, 313 cases of malaria, eight dengue and 43 swine flu cases were reported. As the healthcare machinery is overstretched, many tertiary care hospitals such as civic-run BYL Nair Hospital and the state-run St George Hospitals are likely to face a shortage of beds to treat the dengue and malaria patients.“We are treating over 400 Covid-19 patients and are trying to expand further. But considering we are also a non-Covid hospital, we have kept another group of doctors on stand-by to treat patients with dengue, malaria and swine flu,” said Dr Hemant Deshmukh, dean of King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital, Parel. Doctors are also expecting a rise in cases of fever as many seasonal illnesses have symptoms such as fever, difficulty in breathing and loss of appetite that are virtually indistinguishable from those infected with the Sars-CoV-2.“As their symptoms are similar to Covid-19, we can’t take risks. We may, therefore, require more isolation beds with protective equipment while treating such patients,” Dr Ramesh Bharmal, director of major civic-run hospitals. “These patients will also need to be diagnosed earlier to determine if they need medication for mosquito-borne diseases or Covid-19,” he added.During monsoon, door-to-door screening of residents, especially in slums such as Dharavi, Govandi, may spell trouble. “During monsoon, narrow lanes in slum areas get flooded. Hence, contact-tracing might be problematic for medical volunteers,” said Kiran Dighavkar, ward officer of G/N ward. “We have carried out fumigation and cleaned out breeding grounds in Dharavi and surrounding areas,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/doctors-expect-rise-in-monsoon-illnesses/story-Tst81NsrWDgLdQOfpSYjuM.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Plea against Aarey exclusion from ESZ of SGNP dismissed||The Supreme Court (SC) on Tuesday dismissed a plea challenging the exclusion of Aarey Colony, Goregaon, from the eco-sensitive zone (ESZ) of Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP), while also directing the Maharashtra forest department to submit a report on the allegations of tree felling, forest fires and rising encroachments at Aarey during the lockdown, under a separate application.Both matters were heard via video conferencing by two separate SC benches.In the first case, the Apex court bench, comprising justices Arun Mishra and S Abdul Nazeer, dismissed a civil appeal by environment group Vanashakti, which had challenged the December 5, 2016 ESZ notification for SGNP by the Union environment ministry that had declared a minimum of up to 100m and a maximum of up to 4km from the boundary of SGNP as ESZ, while excluding 165 hectares of Aarey to allow construction, including the Metro-3 car shed. On January 24, the principal bench of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) had disposed of the same application, stating the law had been followed, while demarcating the ESZ. Vanashakti had then challenged the order in the SC, which was heard on Tuesday.“The SC bench did not agree with merits we put forth that the ESZ notification allows construction in eco-sensitive areas around the national park, and dismissed our civil appeal,” said advocate-on-record Srishti Agnihotri, on behalf of Vanashakti, represented by senior counsel Anita Shenoy. “The bench said that Mumbai was already a congested city, and highlighted the importance of sustainable development, while dismissing the plea.”Vanashakti said they will file a review petition in the SC. “The judgment is unfair and does not take into account any of the contentions made by us. If the city is congested, it is all the more necessary to have green zones,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti. “Firstly, NGT disposed of the matter without a hearing, and to make matters worse, SC feels that Mumbai does not need green zones. These are very dangerous assumptions to make.”In the second matter, another SC bench, comprising justices Arun Mishra and Krishna Murari, heard an application filed by Vanashakti, under connected pending matters on Aarey, that alleged illegal tree felling, forest fires, and rising encroachments in Aarey despite there being a lockdown and sought the protection of the area and action against wrongdoers.“The bench called for a report from the Maharashtra forest department to place on record the on-ground situation and action taken by them,” said Agnihotri. “The matter will now come up after six weeks (from Tuesday).”HT had reported on April 18 and May 11 about the surge in illegal activities in and around SGNP, including Aarey, with unidentified violators booked by the local police on directions from the Aarey chief executive officer. However, no arrests were made. Cases of forest fires went unattended as the area fell under the jurisdiction of the State Reserve Police Force and not under Aarey authorities. The Maharashtra forest department said they had already stepped up efforts by removing encroachments from within and around SGNP and Tungareshwar during lockdown. “We will apprise the SC of problems faced in and around SGNP where regular encroachment removal operations and monitoring using drones is being undertaken. Wherever difficulties have been faced, including areas in Aarey, we are waiting for assistance from the police department,” said Sunil Limaye, additional principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife-west).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/plea-against-aarey-exclusion-from-esz-of-sgnp-dismissed/story-2woc3NByePnTvxn47xtl5K.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||75K travel on CR, WR local trains||Approximately 75,000 people travelled on Central (CR) and Western Railway (WR) on Tuesday, registering a marginal increase in the number of commuters on the second consecutive day of local trains operating for workers in essential services. Meanwhile, confusion remains on which sectors qualify as essential. Employees of the postal service, advocates and people in the banking sector are among those who have demanded access to train services. The state government is expected to finalise the list of essential services by the end of the week.On Tuesday, WR saw 40,000 passengers and CR saw 35,000 on local trains. CR and WR had jointly seen a total of nearly 55,000 commuters on Monday, when select local train services resumed for those employed in essential services.Compared to Monday, there were longer queues of passengers outside many stations on Tuesday, including Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Virar railway station. A total of 700 passengers are allowed on board each train, with approximately 58 passengers inside each compartment.“Multiple exit and entry have been restricted to avoid unauthorised travel and overcrowding. Passengers are asked to report early and form a queue for inspection of identity cards and thermal screening before being allowed in the station premises.” said a senior railway official. At most railway stations between Thane and Badlapur, there were large crowds and complaints about mismanagement on Tuesday. Long queues that flouted distancing norms were seen at Thane, Kalyan, Dombivli and Ambernath stations. Commuters complained there were no Government Railway Police (GRP) officials to manage the crowds till 10.30am.Describing the scene at Thane station at around 8am, a commuter said, “There were no markings to guide people on where to stand, so people were crowding at ticket windows. I asked people in my queue and nearby to keep distance, but the people who came later were standing close like they had been earlier.”Satish Jadhav, who works with Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) and commutes from Kalyan to Dadar stations, saw similar scenes. “I came to the railway station around 8.30am and there was a long queue. Around 50 to 60 people were crowding around the counter. There have to be some rules and regulations to collect tickets in a queue,” he said.Commuters say railway personnel were finally deployed at stations around 10am. Public relation officer for CR, S Sutar, said, “We deployed our own staff along with Railway and state police force officials to manage the crowd.” Smita Dhakne of GRP said there are adequate number of officers at all railway stations between Thane and Badlapur. “Our police personnel have been there at every railway station. They have been managing crowds and informing people to keep safe distance while getting into the train, on platform and ticket counters.”According to the railways, 1.25 lakh essential staff are expected to use the local trains. However, there is still lack of clarity in terms of which sectors are permitted to avail train services. The railways had earlier stated BMC, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking and Mumbai Police personnel as well as those working at Mantralaya and in government and private hospitals could travel by train. In order to board the trains, passengers have to undergo thermal screening and show identity cards. However, requests to avail train services have been coming in from employees from other sectors. At present, those working in banking, postal services and media are not allowed to use trains. Advocates, airport employees and employees of pharmaceutical companies have also demanded access to train services. Some took to social media to raise their requests.“@CMOMaharashtra @AUThackeray Sir Advocates in Mumbai should be allowed to board the local train since courts are open. They should be made to show their ID Card of association and further they can show the brief/file of the matter that is on board on that day,” tweeted @yogesh_katira.“@WesternRly .. my wife is an employee of dept. of post government of India. Today at 8.00 am she went to Vasai road railway station to attend duty but she was not allowed to travel while her colleagues frm virar were allowed to travel. Why this discrimination,” tweeted @vincent98836594The state government said the decision of which sectors qualify as essential services and whose employees may travel by train will be finalised in a week. “We have received requests from employees in the private health sector, journalists and others. Finalisation on the employees will be done within a week,” said a senior state government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/75k-travel-on-cr-wr-local-trains/story-LILtS14bah2IzAcUIPlhgI.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Maha Covid-19 toll shoots up to 5,537||RMaharashtra on Tuesday saw the addition of 1,409 Covid-19 deaths to its toll, which includes the reconciliation of 1,328 past fatalities and 81 deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the total to 5,537, even as state authorities were expecting the virus curve to stabilise and the case fatality rate (CFR) to dip.The addition led to a spike in the CFR to 4.8%, from 3.7% on Monday, against the national rate of 3.4%. The Opposition has demanded a high-level inquiry into the “hidden figures of deaths”, terming it a conspiracy. A total of 2,701 more infections were reported in the past 24 hours in the state, taking the Covid-19 case tally to 1,13,445, including Mumbai’s tally of 60,228. Mumbai saw 935 new cases in the past 24 hours. Of the latest added deaths, 862 have been added in Mumbai alone, taking its total to 3,167. This led to controversy as the Opposition raised doubts over the sudden spurt in the death figures. Mumbai’s CFR went up to 5.2%, from 3.79%, as per figures from Monday. There was some relief amid the gloom, as Mumbai on Tuesday reported less than 1,000 Covid-19 cases in a day for the first time this month with 935 cases.The Opposition had on Monday alleged that Maharashtra was covering up death figures. Leader of the opposition Devendra Fadnavis wrote a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday, claiming that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had allegedly not registered 950 deaths as Covid-19 casualties.Fadnavis further claimed that BMC had declared 451 deaths caused by the disease as non-Covid ones. Of these 451 deaths, 356 were declared non-Covid ones, while the remaining were pending for scrutiny. He had also claimed 500-odd deaths that took place in private hospitals due to Covid-19 were not referred.The chief minister’s office, however, tweeted late on Tuesday, “Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had mandated exhaustive data reconciliation last week. On June 13, the state asked all municipal commissioners and collectors to check with all local labs and hospital on the same. The state is fighting Covid with absolute honesty and it holds transparency sacred. Data reconciliation and tally will be done every few weeks so as to ensure complete transparency. Earlier, the duplication of cases was carried out in a similar fashion. Earlier today, chief secretary Ajoy Mehta and health secretary Pradeep Vyas declared the reconciled figure of deaths.”” Bhushan Gagarani, principal secretary, Maharashtra government, said, “The figures of the deaths have risen suddenly owing to the reconciliation of figures. It is true that there was negligence to a certain extent at some level and it led to a mismatch in the figures. This has happened owing to a couple of reasons. Some private hospitals did not provide us information in time, while in some government hospitals, the records about the deaths were not kept properly. In some cases, the death certificates had the mention of Covid infection as cause of fatality, but in hospital records, the entry was missing. When we realised the lapses we, last week, asked all municipal corporations and district collectors to reconcile the data on an urgent basis.”Gagarani also admitted that the data was not being fed as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines, leading to a mismatch in number of deaths.Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant tweeted, “Reconciliation process had started earlier. We should welcome this stand of the state government to correct data. Fadnavisji who sensationalised this, has sources yet working for him in the govt. Today’s declaration was part of the ongoing process, which will happen every month.” He further tweeted, “This letter Principal Secretary Health to all Collectors & Commissioner of Municipal Corporations dated 11th June citing directions of CS to reconcile data of #Covid_19 deaths before 15th June at 5 pm. It clearly suggests that LOP just tried to peep into a legitimate process.” Attached to this tweet is a letter dated June 11 signed by Principal Secretary of the Heath department, Pradeep Vyas, directing all municipal commissioners and district collectors to reconcile data of number of deathsA senior BMC official said “These are mostly deaths from March and April. We have been cleaning up data for the last 15 days as in several hospitals, these had not been reported as per norms. We want to be completely transparent as nothing can be achieved by hiding figures.”The BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal sent a report to the government on Monday, revising the death figures. Fadnavis on Tuesday demanded to know what action will be taken by the state government, over these figures being hidden by the audit committee. He tweeted on Tuesday, “ICMR and World Health Organisation have clear guidelines on recording Covid-19 deaths, despite which the state government appointed a committee for the audit of the deaths. Was this committee to reduce the fatalities or to hide them? It is my sincere request to the state government that please don’t ignore this entire episode of criminal negligence in the name of reconciliation of numbers. These figures were suppressed for past three months. We demand strict action against all those who are responsible for this.” The recovery rate of the state however improved to 50.99% after the number of patients discharged from hospitals rose to 57,851.At present 5.86,686 people are under home quarantine, while 27,242 are in institutional quarantine facilities across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-19-toll-shoots-up-to-5-537/story-iCeI9iHJJ27OqOh5kGBCyM.html
17-06-2020||Mumbai||Man sets up ration distribution system for Mankhurd locals||Although the lockdown meant the collapse of his cable business, Prakash Kumbhar didn’t let that stop him from working to help those in more desperate straits. The entrepreneur has set systems in place to organise relief work and worked with non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to ensure ration is distributed to residents of Mankhurd transit camp.When his cable business stopped making money during lockdown, Kumbhar started selling vegetables to make ends meet. He also gathered volunteers and undertook a survey of Mankhurd transit camp. He developed a colour-coded system to figure out who needed immediate help. Those with no ration were in the red category; those with a week’s were in orange and those with more than a week’s ration were in green.“Among 1,200 houses, there would have been only 10 which had more than a week’s ration [soon after the lockdown],” said Kumbhar, who is also a social worker and associated with Tata Institute of Social Sciences’ (TISS) M-ward project. He contacted NGOs and institutions like TISS and Khaana Chahiye to arrange ration for families of labourers, migrant workers, auto and taxi drivers, and others in need.“I also got in touch with other community leaders in Mandala, Ekta Nagar, Sathe Nagar and asked them to undertake a similar survey. Now, every 15 days, we distribute ration to the families as per the number of members in the family,” Kumbhar said.Residents of Mankhurd transit camp have been living in poor and cramped housing conditions for years now. Kumbhar and his team also cleaned and beautified a small open space in the area where residents could spend some time in the day, he said. Amita Bhide, dean, school of habitat studies, TISS, who helped Kumbhar, praised his leadership. “We must remember here that unlike housing societies, these are informal settlements where no one has a formal role to play. Still, community members like Prakash who have a strong base in the community, have displayed remarkable leadership skills,” Bhide said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-sets-up-ration-distribution-system-for-mankhurd-locals/story-kbOk8ZFgjAHNsAcd6KZ0HK.html

The facility has 970 beds, including 108 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and 12 with dialysis units. The facility will be handed over to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Wednesday at 12.30pm. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray is expected to be present at the event. RA Rajeev, metropolitan commissioner, MMRDA, said, “It was a challenge to build the ICU facility but we managed to pull it off in 17 days.” Another official from MMRDA said that the work started at the end of May but the agency had to battle the cyclone and heavy rains in Mumbai, which posed a huge challenge. Both the phases together now have 2,004 beds. Phase-1 of the facility, which has 1,034 beds, was handed over to BMC at the end of May. Owing to Cyclone Nisarga that hit the state On June 3, patients from phase-1 were shifted out of the facility temporarily. Thackeray had earlier asked MMRDA to assist in setting up modular quarantine and isolation facilities to ramp up the number of beds, as part of the city’s preparedness to battle the pandemic. Mumbai alone has over 55,000 cases, the highest in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmrda-completes-970-bed-facility-at-bkc-in-17-days/story-4DlCVRUcsU2UID2uUoqzUL.html

17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana mandi now open 6 days a week, crowding a problem||Even though Covid-19 cases are increasing in the city, the administration has allowed the sabzi mandi (vegetable market) near Jalandhar bypass to open for six days in a week from Monday to Saturday.Opening days were restricted to just three days a week in April after large crowds gathered there even after the virus outbreak. Though entry has been restricted only to listed vendors and locals are not allowed, a large number of street vendors are entering the market by scaling the wall, authorities said. Things were no different on Tuesday after the markets opened with a large number of people collecting there , giving social distancing a miss. Many were not wearing masks even though authorities had claimed that no one without masks would be allowed to enter.Trading in fruits and vegetables too carried on after 11 am despite operations allowed from 5am to 11am.Many arthiyas (commission agents) requesting anonymity said as they had suffered losses during the lockdown they wanted locals to be allowed to come into the market, but the illegal entry of street vendors who were hand in glove with other arthiyas would hurt their business.The district mandi officer, Jaswinder Singh, in the meanwhile, said: “The deputy commissioner’s office had reviewed the situation, following which mandi operations had been allowed for six days a week. Strict directions had been issued to the arthiyas that they should not trade with any person without a mask. The market committee will also be sanitising the mandi every Sunday. Police have been asked to keep a check on the entry of street vendors in the market.”Following complaints of a huge gathering at the sabzi mandi, the administration had, on April 3, restricted the sale of vegetables and fruits to three days, on Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. Only listed suppliers/vendors selling vegetables to street vendors in the city’s 95 wards were issued passes to enter the market. The vendors were also stopped from setting up their vends.It was suspected that the then district mandi officer Jasbir Kaur who tested positive in April and assistant commissioner of police Anil Kohli, who succumbed to Covid-19, had also contracted the virus while deputed at the mandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mandi-now-open-6-days-a-week-crowding-a-problem/story-xvVFQACrgNTVnTJZ24D2VL.html
17-06-2020||Delhi||Police get 2 months to file charge sheet in N-E riots conspiracy case||A Delhi court granted two months to the Special Cell of the Delhi police to file the charge sheet in an FIR they have registered to prove the conspiracy behind the riots in north-east Delhi. The Delhi police’s special cell had named students, social activists and a local ward councillor as main accused persons of the case. Some of them were Ishrat Jahan, Khalid Saifi, Safoora Zargar, Gufisha Fatima, Natasha Narwal, Devangana Kalita and Tahir Hussain who had been arrested under the Unlawful Activity Prevention Act (UAPA) and are lodged in jail.The police, in the FIR, had also named former JNU student Umar Khalid, however, he had not been arrested till now. Khalid has been denying the charges against him.The police had approached the court seeking more time, saying that they were unable to complete the investigation due to the lockdown and would require more time to file its report in the court. According to the Special Cell’s submissions in the court, Umar Khalid along with the accused had hatched conspiracy to orchestrate riots just before the visit of the US President Donald Trump on February 24-25.Besides, the case by the Special Cell, the crime branch and the local police have already filed nearly 100 charge sheets in connection to the riots. While in general cases, the charge sheets are filed within 90 days, in cases related to the UAPA, the final report can be filed within 180 days of arrest of the accused failing which the accused person is entitled to bail.“ ……….I am of the opinion that the reason cited by the additional public prosecutor in the case at hand are of valid reasons…..,” Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana said.The court noted that the investigation by the police and the application seeking extension mentioned that large number of call detail records and emails of the accused have to be analysed. It also said that the contention of the defense that the report of the prosecution fails to meet the requirement is bereft of merit and thus deserves to be dismissed.On Monday, the Public Prosecutor Irfan Ahmed, appearing for the Special Cell, told the court that some of the key conspirators are yet to be arrested and efforts are being made to identify and arrest the other accused. He said that due to the lockdown, the relevant data from mobile phone of one of the accused, Khalid Saifi could not be recovered as an expert technician could not be reached due to the lockdown.He also stated that efforts are being made to get the mobile phone opened through authorized service station so that data could be extracted and examined to complete the chain of investigation. He said that so far the investigation reveal that there was a deep rooted conspiracy and to unearth that, arrests of remaining accused is important to investigate the case from all possible angles so that a “fair, logical and impartial charge sheet could be filed before the court”.He said that the certified copy of call detail records of the accused are still awaited and it is to be examined for the purpose of investigation.Ahmed also told the court that it is also yet to obtain sanctions from the Department of Prosecution of the Delhi government to prosecute the accused (seven) under the UAPA Act. Delhi police is required to take sanctions from the city government before prosecution under the UAPA act.He sought that the police be granted time till September 17 to file the charge sheets.Opposing the plea, the counsels for the accused contended that their clients have been implicated and there is no evidence with the Delhi police which is why it is seeking time to file the charge sheets.Advocate Mahmood Pracha, who appeared for one of the accused—Gulfisha Fatima—said that even the FIR does not mention the name of her client, and this is a false case by the prosecution.Meanwhile, the Delhi High Court has designated four special courts at the Karkardooma Court complex for hearing the cases related to the riots. In a circular, the high court has designated two sessions and two magisterial courts for trial.Also on Tuesday, a city court posted the cognizance of charge sheet against former AAP councillor Tahir Hussain for Wednesday following the HC’s order. The city police had charged Hussain for leading and instigating the murder of Ankit Sharma, IB official.The matter would be now heard on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-get-2-months-to-file-charge-sheet-in-n-e-riots-conspiracy-case/story-fEKedTYgclW1TVaM4Qi7QO.html
17-06-2020||Chandigarh||When hockey legend Balbir Singh Sr donated three of his Olympic medals for China War fund||Legendary hockey player and triple Olympic gold medallist Balbir Singh Senior, who died on May 25, 2020, was a true nationalist. So great was his love for India that he did not think twice when the country went to war with China and donated three of his Olympic gold medals to the China War fund in October 1962. “The country’s troubled time was bigger than my Olympic medals. That’s why I gave it to the national defence fund,” Singh had said during one of his interviews. When the hockey legend was battling for his life at the Post Graduate Institute of Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, two years back, an old photograph sent to his family by a retired Army officer revived some fond memories. It was from October 1962, when India was at war with China, reflecting the Olympic champion’s selfless and priceless contribution towards the war fund.Sharing Balbir Singh’s unwavering patriotism, Col BN Bali (retired), recalled witnessing a heart touching moment while he was posted at the office of then Punjab chief minister (CM) Partap Singh Kairon. “I was deputed in the CM’s office in October 1962 when Balbir Singh Sr came to meet him. When I questioned him why he needed to see the CM, he specified no reason. I thought that like others he must had also come to get some of his work done. But when he met Partap Singh Kairon, he offered three of his Olympic gold medals (1948, 52, 56) for the China War Fund. This left everyone in the office, including the CM surprised, as nobody had come forward with such a gracious donation before. However, Kairon refused to accept the medals, saying it was the country’s pride. But Balbir Singh said the medals were the best he could offer, and on his insistence, the CM accepted them,” recalled Bali. “However, Kairon did not send the medals to the PM’s relief fund, and told the staff to keep it in the office safe. After a couple of months, the CM returned the medals to Balbir Singh and told him that these are the country’s pride and can’t be exchanged for money.”It was in 2017, when he read in the newspaper that Panjab University created a chair in the name of the hockey legend, Col Bali called the university office to get his contact number. “Eventually, I was able to get in touch with him and his daughter. Later, while surfing my old documents I came across the photograph of 1962 Balbir Singh handing over the medals to Kairon, so I gave the photograph to his family and told them about Balbir ji’s patriotism.”During the 2012 London Olympics, the hosts invited the living legends from the 1948 London Games and had an exhibition of their Olympics artifacts. During that time the three Olympic gold medals were insured for UK pound 300,000 (Rs 2.76 cr). “For my father these Olympic medals are priceless, he always tells us that there is no pride bigger than the country’s honour. So, we never thought about its value in terms of money,” his daughter Sushbir Bhomia had said.Balbir Singh was part of the hockey team that won the Independent India’s first Olympic gold in 1948. A British colony till a year ago, India defeated Britain on their home turf and saw the tricolour of the newly independent nation being hoisted, in a country which ruled them for two centuries.“Though it happened 70 years ago, memories of the London Games are as fresh as it happened yesterday,” Balbir Singh had said in an interview in 2018. “As a child I used to ask my father (Dalip Singh Dosanjh), who was a freedom fighter, what independence meant and what we would get out of it. He would reply that independence would give us our own identity, flag and pride forever. That day when our flag was hoisted in front of thousands of Britons at the Wembley Stadium, I realised what independence means. It was the proudest moment for me and for all Indians back home. When the national anthem was played and the flag was going up, I felt that I was flying. I am short of words to describe that glorious moment.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/when-hockey-legend-balbir-singh-sr-donated-three-of-his-olympic-medals-for-china-war-fund/story-f4EKlmnYDtkAx9Ue0lDG8H.html

17-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt confronts staff shortages for its Covid-19 beds||With cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) rising, the Delhi government is seeking to increase the number of beds available for patients by setting up makeshift hospitals in 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls. The idea is to add 15,800 beds for sick patients. Five hundred converted railway coaches will add another 8,000 beds for the city’s Covid-19 patients.To meet the need for around 150,000 beds by the end of July, the government plans to use stadiums to create makeshift hospitals.The challenge, however, lies in finding a sufficient number of doctors, nurses, and sanitation workers to staff these makeshift hospitals.For Covid-19 patients with mild to moderate symptoms – those who are likely to be admitted to the makeshift hospitals – the government would need at least one doctor for every 10 to 12 beds and one nurse for every five to eight beds, in line with the staffing norms followed in several of the city’s Covid-19 hospitals.This means, for the 23,800 beds that the government is likely to add within this month, there will be a need for over 1,983 doctors and 2,975 nurses assuming the lower staffing estimates. Additionally, the government will also have to hire housekeeping and sanitation staff.The state government is in talks with the Delhi Medical Association to provide staff for the makeshift hospitals.“We have requested the Delhi Medical Association to not only arrange for doctors but also other staff as per need for the upcoming makeshift hospitals,” said a senior official from Delhi’s health department, requesting anonymity.Additionally, the government has set up a helpline number – 08047192219 – where doctors wishing to volunteer for the government’s Covid-19 telemedicine helpline have been asked to give a missed call.“The helpline will recruit doctors for physically treating patients in the makeshift hospitals as well. So far, we have received very few responses,” said the official.The Delhi Medical Association’s plan is also a work in progress, with only four to five people having registered since June 8 when the doctors’ body first met the health minister to discuss the plan.“We have asked our members to provide not only their services but also that of nurses and housekeeping staff they might employ in their clinics and nursing homes. The plan is to ask doctors to adopt a certain number of beds – say 50 or 100 – and use their own staff to man it,” said Dr Girish Tyagi, president of the Delhi Medical Association.The requirement“The government will likely have to hire doctors and nurses. That is the plan but there hasn’t been any decision taken on this,” said another Delhi government official, on condition of anonymity.Of the total beds, those in the hotels will be paid facilities with private hospitals pitching in staff and consumables. As per the government’s May 29 order, five-star hotels will be allowed to charge Rs 5,000 and three or four-star hospitals Rs 4,000 per patient per day, with the linked hospitals allowed to charge up to R 5,000 for medical services and consumables per day.“This does not eat into our manpower too much because we need very few nurses and doctors to monitor the patients with mild symptoms,” said a doctor/executive one of the big private hospitals in the city on condition of anonymity. Another private hospital, however, said it was already facing staff shortages. “Most of our nurses put down their papers when we were asked to earmark beds for Covid-19. Several other demanded higher salaries, it is not possible to do so in this economy,” said a doctor at the private hospital.“The shortage was created in the last three months due to two reasons – one the fear of the infection in the minds of the healthcare workers and two salary cuts that several hospitals had to implement is April and May with their routine surgeries and out-patient clinics remaining closed. Hospitals are likely to make up for the shortfall in revenue with many treating Covid-19 patients. But the government also needs to incentivise workers,” said Girdhar Gyani, director-general of Association of Healthcare Providers (India).He cited the example of the Odisha government that is paying a private medical college hospital to reserve around 500 beds. “In addition, the government is also paying the healthcare worker 50% more in addition to their salaries, who wouldn’t want to work then?,” he said.“In case of banquet halls being turned into hospitals, the logistics are being worked out. We are requisitioning some doctors from all our government hospitals that are not being utilised for Covid. As for the support teams, each hotel and each banquet hall while being requisitioned has also signed for making their staff available to us. So, that in addition to the civil defence volunteers will suffice,” said the government spokesperson.Former AIIMS director, Dr MC Misra, said, “There is no doctor patient ratio that we can follow here as this is not an ideal scenario. But we have to make sure that our healthcare workers are comfortable. One person should be on duty with the PPE {personal protective equipment} only for maybe for hours, but in mild cases – those that are likely to be admitted to the makeshift hospitals – one doctor or trained nurse per ward should be enough.”To augment staff, he said, “Interns and medical students who have done their MBBS from other countries but have not cleared the MCI test can be utilised. Ayurvedic practitioners can be roped in. Delhi can request other states with lower disease burden to send their doctors and nurses. However, the government has to ensure their safety and provide proper incentive,” said Dr Misra. He also suggested leveraging technology for monitoring the mild patients remotely or providing specialist consultations to those outside the hospitals.Existing shortagesA senior government official said the city administration is reorganising the staff in all their hospitals to ensure resources are optimally used. This official said it is here that the role of the medical staff under the municipal corporations will also come into play.“Part of the staff shortage is being addressed by reorganising the existing manpower in all the government hospitals. The process will take 2-3 days more to be finalised. We will also be using the medical staff of the MCD-run hospitals,” said the official.This, however, might not work with doctors and nurses in the existing hospitals already stretched thin.“The government has already taken over the services of almost all the big teaching hospitals in Delhi, which have the maximum number of residents who can work in the Covid-19 wards. And, the total number of beds so far is just 10,000. What about the other 70,000 or so beds that the government plans to create?” said Dr Parv Mittal, vice president of the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association.The government hospitals have a shortage of staff and in March the Covid-19 hospitals of Delhi government were allowed to hire staff up to 25% of sanctioned strength till June 30 to meet any shortfall.“Most of the bigger private hospitals in Delhi are accredited and hence need to hire 125 nurses for every 100 beds. This ratio in government hospitals across the country comes to about 30 nurses for 100 beds; Delhi being a little better it would be about 45 nurses per 100 beds,” said Gyani.The shortage is also acutely felt when it comes to housekeeping staff. “The hospital has always been short staffed when it comes to housekeeping. Earlier, the family members of the patients could help in cleaning up a little, changing sheets, taking the patients to the washroom. Now, there is a big gap in these services,” said a doctor from Lok Nayak hospital.To add to the shortfall, several healthcare workers testing positive are going into quarantine on coming in direct contact with Covid-19 patients. The government will also find it difficult to draw doctors, nurses and staff from its smaller non-Covid-19 hospitals.“We are a non-Covid hospital, but we keep getting patients who later test positive. Some doctors and staff inevitably get exposed and have to go on quarantine. Several of our staff have also tested positive for the infection. We are finding it hard to run our own hospital with the limited manpower, we do not have anyone to spare,” said the administrator of one Delhi-government run hospital on condition of anonymity. The hospital just runs its clinics and emergency services, all routine surgeries and procedures have been put on hold.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-confronts-staff-shortages-for-its-covid-19-beds/story-6iyFnNJjN2j84LoEqfGRFM.html

Police immediately alerted the income tax department and a team from there arrived at the hotel to seize the cash.“We had a lead about fake currency racket but turned out to be something different. We seized the items and handed them over to the income tax department,” said assistant commissioner of police (crime) Preet Pal Sangwan, adding that the case was handed over to the IT department.According to police, five persons were present in the room at the time of raid – owner of a popular chain of jewellery shops, three of his employees and one person from Kerala who had come to visit him in the hotel.“The jeweller was in Gurugram to strike a deal to convert his black money into white. The person from Kerala was supposed to help the jeweller in all these,” said the officer.

On an average 8-10 such people were either issued challans or booked under Section 188 of the IPC at border points daily,” said Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police, Zone-1.So far, 23 police personnel, including the station house officer(SHO) of a city police station, have been tested positive for Covid-19, of whom 17 have recovered while the rest are undergoing treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/85-violators-on-average-arrested-daily-during-lockdown/story-5XbvQA6loCTbQrAgHKgoLL.html

The incident took place around 5.40am. According to hospital authorities, she was suffering from pneumonia. “She had come to the hospital on Sunday and was in the isolation ward on the 7th floor. She was due for a Covid test on Monday, but before that could happen she took her own life by jumping from a window on the floor,” director of the hospital said.The woman had allegedly asked her father to get her juice and when he left, she jumped from the window, the hospital authorities said, adding that she was being taken care of properly. According to police officers, the woman, a Noida resident who had recently completed her graduation, was also suffering from some other ailments like diabetes.“Her family said she had been upset for a while due to her deteriorating health. No note was recovered from the spot, and the family could not think of any other issue that might have led her to take her own life,” said Rajneesh Verma, assistant commissioner of police, Zone 1.According to the police, after the incident her samples were taken for Covid-19 test as doctors suspected her of having symptoms of Covid-19 and the body was sent for an autopsy. As it is a non-Covid hospital, they were taking necessary precautions by placing her in an isolation ward, the police said.Her report on Tuesday came positive for the virus, Verma said, adding that arrangements are now being made to perform her last rites as per protocol. The woman’s family has not filed any formal complaint with the police, the official said.Gautam Budh Nagar does not have a dedicated helpline to deal with such situations. A few major suicide prevention helpline numbers in India are +914066202000 from ‘Roshni’ (Hyderabad-based) and +914424640050 from Sneha India Foundation (Delhi-based).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-23-yr-old-woman-a-covid-suspect-kills-self-by-jumping-from-hospital-building/story-7eEUrLW8mT2HmwRSAuhYMJ.html
17-06-2020||Delhi||Central committee asked to review 25 private hospitals in Delhi||A 16-member Central panel, formed to assess the existing capacity and patient care amenities at Delhi government hospitals for the treatment of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), have been asked to review preparedness in 25 private hospitals as well.The panel – divided in three teams – was initially supposed to inspect 10 government hospitals treating Covid-19 patients in Delhi and submit a report by Wednesday. Now with the Delhi government asking it to check private hospitals, the committee is likely to ask for an extension.“Each of the three teams would now have to visit at least eight hospitals, which would require three to four days. This is in addition to two or three government hospitals. The committee may need more time to assess the hospitals,” said one of the committee members, on condition of anonymity.The private hospitals to be assessed include Max in Saket and Shalimar Bagh, all three hospitals of Sir Ganga Ram, Fortis Shalimar Bagh and Escorts in Okhla, BLK hospital, Indraprastha Apollo hospital among others.The committee will mainly look at five key areas and suggest measures to better implement patient care in the city. The areas of focus would be the existing infrastructure and how it can be expanded, staff issues, mortuaries and dignified disposal of the dead, whether in-house testing is available in the Covid-19 hospitals, and other measures such as signages to help patients.“The aim is to improve patient satisfaction,” said the committee member quoted above.The committee includes senior doctors from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the central Directorate General of Health Services, Delhi government institutes, and municipal corporations.The committee was formed after a meeting of Delhi government ministers and key officials with union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday. Another committee formed after the meeting – headed by NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul – to assess capping of prices in some of the beds in private hospitals was to submit its report on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/central-committee-asked-to-review-25-private-hospitals-in-delhi/story-dxD395LEScp14yECbN7eOP.html
17-06-2020||Gurugram||Many Gurugram patients seeking plasma therapy, but it is no magic bullet: Doctors||Doctors at privately-run dedicated Covid-19 hospitals in Gurugram say that many patients were interested in seeking convalescent plasma therapy, a promising yet unproven treatment, to treat the disease. At present, India’s premier biomedical research body, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), has authorised at least 30 hospitals across the country to conduct clinical trials of the treatment. In Gurugram, it is the Medanta Hospital in sector-38. Here too, doctors say, it is a challenge to finding donors.Convalescent plasma therapy, in which antibody-rich plasma from recovered patients is injected into recovering individuals to help them stave off infection, has previously been used during the Sars and Mers outbreaks (which were also caused by viruses in the same family as the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19). Plasma is a major component of a person’s blood, making up almost 55% of it. A plasmapheresis machine separates it from the blood and returns the rest -- the red blood cells, white blood cells and platelets -- back into to the donor who typically supplies 300-500 ml of plasma, and the transfusion process takes between 60-90 minutes.With the rising interest, many citizens have organised themselves on WhatsApp, Twitter and even on web portals designed to meet the demand. Rajat Toor, a Delhi-resident who has been involved in connecting donors with patients, said, “A relative of mine required a plasma for treatment at a hospital in Saket. I posted about it online, and since then many inquiries have been coming in, from recovered patients who wished to donate but also from people seeking plasma. Now I am currently seeking donors for two patients under treatment, one in Delhi and the other in Gurugram.” Doctors say the treatment has come to be perceived as a ‘silver bullet’, particularly among relatives of critically ill patients, which is not the case. A pulmonologist at a prominent private hospital in Gurugram, who is directly overseeing the treatment of Covid-19 patients, said, “Recent stories in the media, celebrating isolated success cases from across the country, seems to have stoked people’s interest in plasma therapy. While it holds a lot of promise, the evidence to widely administer is still being pursued. We are having to turn down multiple inquiries every day.”Dr. Rajesh Kumar, epidemiologist and former professor of community medicine at PGIMS, Chandigarh, who is assisting the Punjab government in its response to the pandemic, pointed to recent examples of plasma therapy-led recoveries of patients in Punjab, Kerala, and more recently at PGIMER, Chandigarh, where a 60-year-old man from Kurukshetra recovered. “These examples are promising, but patients and their relatives should be careful to not grasp at straws. Physicians should be trusted to find the best course of treatment, depending on the patient’s need,” Kumar said, adding that more widespread use of convalescent plasma is still some time away. Another doctor at a private hospital said, “We have one 84-year-old man whose son has been pleading with us to start plasma therapy. He even managed to find a donor from Delhi. When we told him it was not possible, as we do not yet have permission to administer it, he tried to shift his father to another private hospital in the city where it is available. But the patient is already on the ventilator so that would endanger his life even more.”Dr. Sushila Kataria, an internist at Medanta Hospital, said, “Patients and their relatives are seeking this treatment, but we cannot administer it to everyone. The criteria for ICMR’s clinical trial is very strict in terms of the patient’s age, and at which stage of the disease they are at, and so on. Not all patients meet this criteria. In certain cases, and only where required, we are administering ‘off-label’ use of plasma therapy.” Off-label application of the therapy for treating patients in moderate stage of criticality was recently approved by the union health ministry.Then there is the other challenge of finding donors. “It is not possible to harvest plasma from (cured) patients while they are (still) under treatment. It has to be done about two weeks after recovery, at which stage people are reluctant to come back to hospitals,” Kataria said. She added that, at Medanta, it was initially recovered health workers who were donating plasma.Mohit Tandon, whose 74-year-old mother, Sudha Tandon, died due to the virus at Medanta Hospital last week, said, “We were offered the option of plasma therapy when she was critically ill, and were told to find donors. This turned out to be quite hard. You have to find someone of the same blood group, scrutinise their health history, and appeal to their goodwill. I eventually approached an NGO in Delhi which is helping connect patients with plasma donors. Most people I contacted myself were simply not willing.” Immediate relatives of at least four other patients who have received plasma therapy at Medanta said they faced similar issues, and were compelled to rely on the help of NGOs and volunteers to find suitable donors. Manish, who went by only his first name whose sexagenarian father is currently under treatment at Medanta, said, “It was much harder for us because my father has a rare blood type, and it took us three days to find the right person.” Manish, who is a resident of Dwarka in East Delhi, said, “I chose to admit my father in Gurugram precisely because the option of plasma therapy was available there, and government hospitals in Delhi had no beds available. I know at least two other Delhi residents who chose treatment in Gurugram because of these reasons.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/many-gurugram-patients-seeking-plasma-therapy-but-it-is-no-magic-bullet-doctors/story-hV2WobnPDJXcbZ8J6HQ6FP.html

When I took him to a hospital in West Delhi, he was referred to GTB Hospital where he tested positive for Covid-19 last week,” said Pankaj, who works at an optical showroom in Connaught Place and lives with his parents and two siblings in their west Delhi home. Ramesh died on Monday, 2 am. Pankaj was completing formalities to receive the body, and had arranged a cab for his mother and siblings to be with him.“I was outside the hospital’s gate number six and was speaking to a friend to come and help me with cremation when two men on a motorcycle snatched my phone and fled,” said Pankaj. “At that moment, I felt it was the end of the world for me. It felt as if all the troubles of life were meant for me.”The snatched phone, was just a month-old, apart from being a link to his family and friends, also had his father’s Aadhar card image that he needed printed to receive the body. A nearby tea seller offered his mobile phone to call the police. “I first brought out my hand sanitiser and disinfected my hands before accepting his phone. It would have been unfair to put a person helping me at risk,” said Pankaj.Pankaj eventually managed to establish contact with his family, complete all formalities and receive the, and finally cremate his father. “We have some clues about the suspects after working on the ground,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/outside-gtb-hospital-snatchers-target-man-waiting-to-receive-covid-19-infected-father-s-body/story-1Xmqr2l7PoC2Ja8LWmnWGP.html
17-06-2020||Delhi||Hospitality to health care: Hotels prepare for life as Covid-19 facilities||Preparations to provide beds for patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in city hotels, which have been attached to hospitals in their neighbourhood, began in full swing from Tuesday, a day after the Delhi High Court allowed the Delhi government to take over two hotels for running extended Covid care centre for asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms.Hotel Crowne Plaza, Okhla and Hotel Suryaa, New Friends Colony, had moved the court against the move but after a two-member court appointed committee submitted that there are spaces in the two hotels which can be appropriately equipped and converted into dedicated Covid health centres, the High Court gave the go ahead to the government. The Delhi government had on May 29 ordered five hotels to be used as Covid facilities to meet the requirement for beds in view of the spike in coronavirus cases. The hotels are Crowne Plaza (attached with Batra Hospital; Hotel Suryaa (Apollo ); Hotel Siddharth (B L Kapur Memorial Hospital); Hotel Jivitesh (Sir Gangaram Hospital); Sheraton Saket (Max Super Speciality Hospital). Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, previously attached to Jivitesh hotel, was attached to a second hotel - Taj Mansingh - on Tuesday. The hospital said it has started surveying the hotels assigned to it. “A lot of changes will have to be made because hotels as such are not designed to act as a backup for hospitals. But, these are extraordinary times. We are working closely with the hotel to decide on the separate entrance and exits, sanitising and screening areas at the entry and readily available dedicated ambulances to shift the Covid patient immediately to the hospital if the situation deteriorates,” said Dr Ajay Swaroop, honorary secretary, board of management, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. These hotel-hospitals will be equipped with oxygen cylinders and concentrators, medicines, bi-level positive airway pressure (BiPAP), intravenous (IV) fluids and stands, pulse oximeters and so on. Hospital managements will also have to ensure a conducive air-conditioning at these hotels because they have to ensure the air flow does not spread infections. A senior official of Apollo hospital, which has been attached to Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn hotels in Mayur Vihar among others, said one of the important tasks at hand is to study the airflow at these hotels. “Typically for Covid positive patients, we need either a negative pressure or a uni-directional airflow so that the common areas and corridors do not get infected. If it is a Covid care centre then it is much easier because you just have to create a good exhaust system. Even rooms which have natural airflow will create a negative pressure. For something more severe, one would need a higher grade of air-conditioning to create a negative airflow, which will be a bit difficult to achieve,” said the official. A negative pressure room includes a ventilation system that decreases the viral load of the aerosolised space by throwing out the infected air out of the building using a negative pressure. On June 14, HT had reported on the government requisitioning as many as 40 hotels having a total capacity of 4,628 beds to be attached with private hospitals. All the attached hospitals that HT spoke to said the HC order on Monday has caused confusion whether the hotels have to be turned into Covid Care Centres (CCCs), primarily meant for asymptomatic (with no facility of home quarantine) patients and mild cases, or makeshift hospitals. They said the government has to clarify whether the HC order of setting up CCCs in the two hotels will be applicable to all other hotels as well. “If it is CCC, the job is much easier and quicker. But if they have to turn into makeshift hospitals, as the government orders also state, then more equipment and arrangements will be required. But, it is totally doable,” the hospitals said. Despite government orders on requisitioning various hotels, only Sheraton in Saket is currently operational as an extended Covid facility. “It is because all other hotels and the hospitals were waiting for the verdict of the high court in the matter,” said a government official. Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket Complex, which has been running the facility in Sheraton said they identified space and created a medical store within the hotel.“This medical store is adequately equipped with medicines, consumables and equipment at all times. This is a must-do for all the hospitals that have been attached to hotels. Spaces also have to be earmarked for the clinical staff such as doctor and nurse duty rooms. Since medical staff also need to be quarantined at defined intervals, manpower planning is the key,” said Dr Gurpreet Singh, vice president and unit head, Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket Complex.The hotels said they would provide their staff for all hotel-related services including rooms, housekeeping, disinfection and food for the patients. “The orders state that the hotel staff will be trained by the concerned hospitals. Right from our chefs to the housekeeping staff, workers will have to be taught how to wear protective gear and how to dispose them. We are also arranging for a lot of disposable plates, water bottles and cutlery. The charges are to be collected by the hospital and the hospital will pay the hotel,” said an official of hotel Crowne Plaza in Mayur Vihar, which has been attached to Indraprastha Apollo hospital in Sarita Vihar. ITC Hotels, which runs the Sheraton hotel in Saket, said it is following a stringent hygiene protocol. “Stringent hygiene protocol is being observed at the hotel. All necessary safety precautions are being taken,” a spokesperson of ITC hotels said. The list of hotels also includes two top hotels in South Delhi, Vasant Continental and Hyatt Regency; Maidens Hotel of the Oberoi Group in Civil Lines (supervised by Sant Parmanand Hospital); Hyatt Regency in Bhikaji Cama Place (Fortis Hospital, Vasant Kunj); Park Inn by Radisson in Lajpat Nagar (Moolchand hospital) and Hotel Ramada in Pitampura (Jaipur Golden Hospital).Patients opting for the beds in hotels will have to pay a minimum of Rs 63,000 a week if it’s a three- or four-star hotel. For a five-star hotel, the weekly charge may go up to at least Rs 70,000. In addition, patients needing oxygen support will have to pay Rs 2,000 a day. The charges will vary with medical investigations, which private hospitals overseeing these facilities will bill at their own rates and the duration of treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hotels-to-hospitals-delhi-hc-order-paves-the-way-for-transition/story-3O7T9GdBebG4OgEvwQG8eK.html
17-06-2020||Delhi||Disposal of bodies expedited after Amit Shah’s directions||At least 380 cremations and burials of the bodies of Covid-19 positive and suspected patients took place in the last two days across Delhi, officials of the three municipal corporations said on Tuesday. The officials said these cremations and burials include pending as well as fresh bodies released by hospitals in the city. “Nearly 380 cremations and burials (suspected and confirmed Covid-19 patients) have been conducted on Monday and Tuesday. Now, there is no pendency at crematoriums and graveyards run by the civic bodies. These cremations include both done on wood pyre and by CNG method,” a senior official at North Corporation said on the condition of anonymity.According to figures provided by the three municipalities, as many as 157 cremations and burials were conducted in the last two days at crematoriums and graveyards managed by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC); at least 121 at those run by SDMC and 103 at facilities run by the North Corporation. There are nearly 17 crematoriums and graveyards where funerals of Covid-19 confirmed and suspected cases are being conducted in the city.Officials said the last rites of confirmed and suspected patients of Covid-19 were expedited after Union home minister Amit Shah’s directions to all Delhi hospitals on Sunday.A statement released by the Press Infirmation Bureau on Tuesday evening said that following directions of the Union home minister, all hospitals in Delhi, (Central and State Government and private), on Tuesday complied with the directive by speeding up cremation and last rites of bodies of Covid-19 patients. “The hospital staff performed the last rites of most Covid-19 deceased with consent and presence of their families and relatives. Last rites of the remaining 36 deceased will be done by tomorrow (Wednesday) as their Next Of Kin are not in Delhi at present,” the PIB statement said.It added that the ministry of home affairs has given strict directions to hospitals that going forward there should be no delays in performing last rites.Earlier last week, the municipalities had claimed that from March 2020 till June 11 afternoon, as many as 2,098 cremations and burials of Covid-19 confirmed cases were conducted at the cremation grounds and graveyards falling under the three municipalities. Out of 2,098 Covid-19 funerals, 1,080 were conducted in SDMC, 976 in north corporation and 42 in EDMC. The Delhi government had, however, pegged the Covid-19 death figure at 1,085 till June 11. The civic bodies had also claimed that they had separately conducted funerals of 240 Covid-19 suspected bodies till June 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/disposal-of-bodies-expedited-after-shah-s-directions/story-rsBhZPfPII5m2wlsSvXwzK.html
17-06-2020||Delhi||270 train coaches at Anand Vihar railway station turn makeshift Covid care wards||Nearly 270 train coaches-turned-makeshift Covid-19 wards, to treat those with mild symptoms, were deployed at the Anand Vihar Railway Station on Tuesday, across its seven platforms. Five trains that had been running to and from the station will now operate from the Old Delhi Railway Station until further orders.Officials said the coaches are ready to be used, as and when the government needs. The development comes two days after the Centre had promised Delhi 500 such coaches to fight the Covid-19 crisis, after the Capital reported a surge in numbers and the government said it expects to see nearly 550,000 cases by July-end. As per the Delhi Corona app, the Capital as of Tuesday evening has 10,500 Covid-19 beds, fewer than half of which are currently vacant.Delhi on Tuesday recorded 1,859 new cases, taking the tally to 44,688. The government’s bulletin recorded new 93 deaths on the day as well.With the Delhi government exploring spaces like banquet halls and hotels to convert into facilities to treat Covid-19 patients, the remodelled railway coaches equipped with oxygen cylinders, beds, and bathrooms have presented themselves as another alternative for the state government.Over 40 such coaches were stationed at platform numbers 4 and 5 of Anand Vihar station on Tuesday. Deepak Kumar, chief public relations officer (CPRO) of Northern Railway, said another 50 coaches had already been deployed in Shakur Basti railway station’s washing area, Kumar said. Of these, 10 were deployed on May 31, and 40 on Sunday.“Around 170 will be deployed at the platforms and 100 more parked near the washing area at Anand Vihar station. The location for the remaining coaches will be decided in consultation with the Delhi government in the coming days,” Kumar said. While food, electricity, and water will be provided by the railways, the Delhi government will be charged with the management of patients and nominating a hospital to operate Anand Vihar Covid care centre.The Delhi government said the coaches will be used as Covid Care Centres, where patients with mild symptoms of the infectious disease, and who cannot isolate at home, are treated. “The railway coaches will be for mild cases of the disease. The government is still working out the plan for the staff. On site, at present, arrangements for oxygen and other equipment are currently underway,” said a government spokesperson. When asked why the coaches at Shakur Basti were yet to be used, despite being placed on May 31, the above quoted government spokesperson added, “The facility is on a requirements basis. Currently, we don’t need to use all the facilities at one go.”The metal plates on the sides of coaches that usually display the train route, now read “Covid-19 isolation” instead. Each blue and beige non-AC coach, brought in from Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Haryana, has three oxygen cylinders and can accommodate 16 patients — two in each coupe. The first coupe equipped with oxygen cylinders will be reserved for medical staff, and is separated from other coupes by a plastic sheet. Each coupe is equipped with two power sockets, and two dustbins, apart from fans, lights and mosquito nets that are fixed to the windows.The toilets have been remodelled to function as a bathing area. With vestibules on either end of the coaches sealed, movement between rakes will be restricted. In addition to the non-AC coaches, two AC coaches have been deployed per platform, for medical equipment, staff members, and other facilities.Kumar said that since the trains were parked near the shed, the temperature would remain bearable. “In areas where there are no sheds, we are in the process of using bubble sheets on the roofs of the coaches that can help bring down the temperature inside the coaches by three-four degrees,” he said.Personnel at the station on Tuesday were busy putting up flex boards demarcating different areas on the platform, to be used for patients to enter and exit. Station manager Om Kumar said the area leading to the platform has ramps and if needed, ambulances can take patients onto the platform as well. Officials also said the entire area will be limited only to permitted staff members once all the coaches are put in place.With the entry and exit point of Anand Vihar railway station barricaded and manned by paramilitary personnel, the area outside the terminal mostly bore a deserted look, barring a few workers carrying medical equipment like oxygen cylinders, masks, nasal prongs, personal protective equipment kits and disposable bags, among other things, into the station from the divisional hospital at Mori Gate. A few passengers who reached the station, unaware of the latest development, were told by Railway Protection Force guards that their trains would now operate from Old Delhi railway station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/270-train-coaches-at-anand-vihar-railway-station-turn-makeshift-covid-care-wards/story-9DUxqfbrpkcC4DGgAX1jjL.html

He was, however, arrested in a chain theft case with the other man and brought back to jail on the intervening night of June 7 and 8. The two were kept in the quarantine block as a precautionary measure to avoid infection among inmates in case they had contracted the virus, said an official privy to the matter.The bodies of the two men were found hanging by jail authorities on Tuesday.An inquiry has been initiated and the bodies sent to the Civil Hospital in Ambala city, said jail superintendent Lakhbir Singh Brar..Autopsy in presence of judicial magistrateAccording to procedures, the postmortem and other formalities were done in the presence of a judicial magistrate. “If the investigation reveals any fault on the part of jail authorities, strict action will be taken,” Brar said.The reason for the suicides was not known, “but we have started online counselling sessions for the inmates as they are not able to meet their loved ones (due to the Covid-19 social distancing measures). We too cannot organise recreational activities for them due to the pandemic,” he added.A police official from the Baldev Nagar police station said both the men were arrested on June 6 in a snatching case in the Sector 7 area. They were sent to judicial custody after a purse was recovered from their possession.Prison in the newsIt is worth mentioning that Ambala Central Jail has been in the news for the last few weeks after an accused lodged in the jail taken on production remand to Chandigarh in a shooting case revealed he had used a mobile phone in the jail premises.Earlier, a couple of mobile phones and SIMs were also recovered from the premises after which cases were lodged at Baldev Nagar police station.Though he did not specifically comment on the Chandigarh case, the jail superintendent said: “In the recent past, outsiders have thrown SIMs and mobile phones inside the jail that were recovered by the jail guards and cases were registered with the police. They are investigating the matter and our staff with the help of the police has conducted searches inside the barracks too.”If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

17-06-2020||Pune||Covid-19: Pune breaches grim 10K mark on 100th day||Pune on Tuesday crossed the grim 10,000 Covid-19 cases mark becoming one of the worst-affected cities in the state due tot he pandemic. Tuesday also marked the 100th day since the Sars-Cov-2 virus, which causes the Covid-19 infection, had been first reported in Pune and in Maharashtra.On the 100th day, the Covid-19 tally of the city stood at 10,183. Besides Pune, other cities in the state which have also crossed the 10,000 mark are Mumbai and Thane. The city reported its first case on March 9 when a resident of Sinhgad road returned from Dubai with his family and tested positive for the virus. The next day on June 10, his wife along with driver of the private taxi he had hired to come to Pune from the Mumbai airport, also tested positive for the Covid-19 infection. Over the 100 days, Pune has recorded 469 Covid related deaths with 11 deaths reported on Tuesday. While the virus spread rapidly across the city, the recovery rate of patients also increased and currently stands at 65.17 per cent. Shekhar Gaikwad, Pune municipal commissioner said, “We are facing a rare pandemic for the first time in this century and therefore, our administrative skills were tested and challenged. We estimated to have around 40,000 cases in the city by May-end earlier, but fortunately we succeeded in controlling the situation.”Although Bhavani peth and Dhole Patil wards initially reported high number of cases, the virus spread relented in these areas in June, however, Aundh-Baner and Sinhgad road now witnessing rapid surge in number of positive cases. During these 100 days, the city also underwent massive changes with Covid induced lockdown bringing all outdoor activities to standstill as the fear of infection and government invoked restrictions kept people inside. The virus drastically altered the lives of Punekars with some of the landmark places in the city closing down and most slums and adjoining areas being declared containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-breaches-grim-10k-mark-on-100th-day/story-VhRFxUQEXEHMajicU2QUoK.html
17-06-2020||Pune||Ajit Pawar vetoes PMC decision to expand road width||Days after the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) ratified a proposal to convert roads with six-metre width to nine-metre, deputy chief minister and Pune guardian minister Ajit Pawar has stayed the decision pushed forward in civic corridors by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).Pawar on Tuesday held a meeting with officials at Mantralaya and instructed the urban development secretary Pravinsinh Pardeshi and Mahesh Pathak to scrap the PMC proposal.He, however, instructed officials to allow additional TDR (transfer of development rights) on existing six-metre-wide roads by keeping some riders, a move considered to boost redevelopment of old buildings and individual bungalows in the city. Higher TDR enable builders to use additional floor space index (FSI) which in turn will create more flats. FSI indicates how many floors a developer can build on a plot. It is the ratio of total built-up area to the size of the plot.Earlier, the proposal approved by PMC standing committee where BJP is in majority, was limited to 323 roads, most of them from central parts and areas like Kothrud and Baner. The decision that time was opposed by the NCP and the Congress. The BJP incorporated suggestions from opposition parties and decided to widen all the six-metre-wide roads in the city into nine metres.The deputy CM, however, instructed officials to allow additional TDR on existing six-meter-wide roads by keeping 1.5 metre free space on either side for road widening. Pawar also put the condition that TDR will be utilised only after widening the road.NCP MP Vandana Chavan, city MLA’s Chetan Tupe and Sunil Tingre were present at the meeting along with urban development officers. PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad and city engineer Prashant Waghmare joined the meeting through video conferencing.The purpose of widening the roads is that old housing societies and individual bungalows can go for redevelopment. As there is no provision for using the additional TDR below the road width of nine metre, it was not becoming affordable to do redevelopment for builders and property owners.BJP state unit president and Kothrud MLA Chandrakant Patil supported the standing committee’s decision for widening the road width from six metres to nine metres.Ajit asserts his authority in Pune againPMC is ruled by the BJP which has a clear majority. For the last five years, the BJP enjoys power at all the three levels — Centre, state and city. The change of guard in state has powered Pawar to take control over PMC. Earlier, he made changes in former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis dream project High Capacity Mass Transit Route (HCMTR).QuotesHemant Rasane (PMC standing committee chairperson, BJP) – I heard that Ajit Pawar scrapped our decision, but we did not get any written order. PMC is yet to forward the proposal to the state government for final approval. The decision was taken for the city to generate more revenue for PMC. It is better to make comments after reading the order.Chetan Tupe (MLA and NCP city unit president) – Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis himself took a decision earlier not to give extra FSI or TDR on roads below 6 metres. The BJP leaders took a U-turn and passed the proposal for widening of roads. They put it only for selected roads. Irony is that BJP’s city unit president Jagdish Mulik earlier used to give letters to minimise road width in Pune and now his party is approving a proposal for widening of roads.Arvind Shinde (Congress party leader in PMC) — The BJP came out with the proposal by keeping specific housing projects in their mind. First they did the fixing with builders and came out with the proposal for only those roads where redevelopment is in the pipeline. From day one, we were demanding that the policy should be for the whole city and not for specific areas.Prithviraj Sutaj (Shiv Sena leader) — We opposed the proposal in the standing PMC committee, but the ruling BJP approved it by majority. We warned them that though they would approve it, we would ask for justice from the state government. The proposal put by the BJP was only for vested interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ajit-pawar-vetoes-pmc-decision-to-expand-road-width/story-IlQhx9mZ3VTvD9TWTQup1I.html
17-06-2020||Pune||100 days of Covid-19: Pune learns to readjust course of life||From taking over municipal schools and college hostels for establishing quarantine facilities to declaring the entire city as a containment zones, Pune has seen it all since the first Covid-19 (coronavirus) case was reported 100 days ago. Pune reported its first Covid-19 positive case on March 9, which was also the first to be recorded in the state. After 100 days, the Covid-19 tally in Pune stands at 10,183 cases and 1,10,744 cases (June 15) in Maharashtra.Over 100 days, the city has seen multiple flu clinics, dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and health centres come up with the civic body putting in all its efforts to tackle the spread of virus. The Covid-19 pandemic has altered the lives of residents, bringing various behavioural changes such as social distancing, wearing masks in public among others. One of the city’s busiest market destination, Tulshibaug, had been out of bounds for two-and-a-half months, a scene Pune had never witnessed. The entire Pune metropolitan region, including Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad, had been declared a containment zone between April 19 and April 27, putting about 7.5 million people of an entire city under strict lockdown, which was the first of its kind in the country. Currently, while the worst-affected wards of Bhavani peth and Patil estate slums are showing an improvement, Aundh-Baner wards, which were on the verge of being declared green zones, are now steadily reporting more cases. There are 66 containment zones spread across 9.28 square kilometers, mostly in the central areas of the city. “With time, we decided to go for smaller containment zones which made it easier for us to manage and control the spread of the virus. We focused on flu clinics, mobile clinics and mobile swab collection centres. Pune city fortunately did not face any shortage of beds, personal protective equipment (PPE) kits or any resources till now. We succeeded in bringing down the death rate from 10 per cent to four per cent. We took over college hostels, municipal schools and even signed MOUs with over 10 hospitals to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Shekhar Gaikwad, Pune municipal commissioner. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has so far set up 30 Covid care centres, 11 dedicated Covid health centres and 25 dedicated Covid hospitals. However, the frontline workers are still facing problems of coordination with government bodies. Dr Avinash Bhondwe, Indian Medical Association (IMA) Maharashtra state president, said, “The government keeps bringing in more notifications without keeping us in the loop and doctors along with the common public has to rely on the media for accurate information. Patients suffering from other ailments have been ignored completely.” The city has also lost three of its police officials and seven PMC staff members to Covid-19. Government bodies at various levels including central, state and local civic bodies announced a collective compensation of Rs one crore for the next of kin of these frontline workers. Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of police, says, “Our anticipation that this will grow into a bigger challenge helped us take charge of the situation. We ensured the wellness and welfare of our staff which is why no one complained of any shortage of masks. The challenge for us was to ensure that there is a check on crime in the city and also see that our staff is not exposed to the virus. Exposure of even one official meant that the entire police station would have to be shut. During this time, while we advocated social distancing, our men worked tirelessly in containment zones.” The situation also shed light on poor urban planning as the worst-affected cities reported more cases from slums- be it Mumbai’s Dharavi or Pune’s Tadiwala slum or Janata vasahat. Ramchandra Gohad, a town planner, said, “Health and urban planning is linked. The reason for growth of slums in cities also shows the poor execution of government schemes like SRA and MHADA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/100-days-of-covid-19-pune-learns-to-readjust-course-of-life/story-bo9G1RUSNnJGkjmN0jDzqL.html

The public transport’s decision has left drivers and conductors get salary for 2 or 3 days. The company has also deducted its staff’s one-day salary and deposited it in Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.“When the lockdown was announced, the number of PMPML buses plying on roads reduced drastically as only emergency service people were allowed to use the transport utility. Hence, staff were called on rotational basis. Now PMPML has given salaries to workers for only those days which they worked in May. Most of them have got salaries between Rs 1,000 and Rs 2,000. How can we manage our monthly expenses with this amount? The company has even deducted our one day’s salary to give to chief minister’s relief fund,” said Sunil Nalawade, general secretary, PMPML Nationalist Congress Party union.The monthly salary of PMPML staff ranges from Rs15,000 to Rs 20,000, he said.The union has written to PMPML management demanding full salary for the month of May. It has threatened to go on ‘stop work’ protest from next week if their demand is not met.Speaking on condition of anonymity, a PMPML driver said, “I was ready to work during the lockdown and repeatedly asked for it to my reporting depot manager, but I was called on duty for 3 to 4 days. I got my salary only for those days. I didn’t go on voluntarily leave, but was told to sit at home. I have two children and am the sole earner. How will I manage the family expense during these difficult times.”PMPML joint managing director Ajay Charthankar said, “During the lockdown period, operations were reduced to five per cent and the situation has not improved in the city even now. As a result, revenue generation is less. As the firm is facing huge losses, salary cuts were done but none of our staff have been asked to leave. The issue will be put up before the board of directors and demand for monetary help will be sought from Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad civic bodies.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmpml-staff-get-salary-only-for-days-worked-during-lockdown/story-U97KzsUvNxG5AeAzRLvyXM.html

The fund will be diverted to works related to Covid-19 (coronavirus).Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad placed the proposal before the standing committee requesting the elected members to approve the cut in the overall capital works marked in the budget.Gaikwad said, “When the civic body approved the budget, there was no Covid-19 situation. The civic administration is utilising fund in providing various health related facilities related to the virus. As per a primary estimate, PMC will require Rs200 to Rs250 crore to cover the Covid-19 expense in the financial year. Hence, the elected members need to raise fund for Covid-19 works.”PMC standing committee chairperson Hemant Rasane said, “Standing committee has approved the proposal submitted by the municipal commissioner and agreed for a 10 per cent cut for all the capital works. It would be either road, drainage or any other department’s works.”Rasane said, “The budget provision would not get cut from slum rehabilitation, welfare schemes of Scheduled Castes and Tribes, disabled persons and works carried out by regional ward offices.”The commissioner said, “Right now the administration needs fund for taking various steps to execute the lockdown, provide medical facilities and food to patients, and cover the costs of Covid hospitals.”The commissioner said that as the overall revenue of all government departments would be affected, the civic administration need to remain cautious while restarting any new project.The central teams that visited Pune city recently had stated that the impact of Covid-19 would continue for more months and civic bodies should be prepared to manage its financial responsibilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-standing-panel-okays-10-cut-in-capital-works-to-cover-virus-expenses/story-A98AF3Kk9fmLXWxS3zgjeI.html
17-06-2020||City||Galwan face-off: Nyoma block chief had flagged Chinese activity in eastern Ladakh several times||Before the India-China stand-off in eastern Ladkah took a violent turn in Galwan Valley late on Monday, Nyoma block development council (BDC) chairperson Urgain Chodon had been constantly flagging the Chinese activity picking up along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in the strategic region.On April 27, Chodon had first raised the issue of heightened Chinese activity in Demchok area on her Facebook page, but had withdrawn the post moments later.However, in a series of posts and pictures on June 11, the BDC chief once again exposed China’s expansionist transgressions and the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) continued usurping of Indian territory in eastern Ladakh. These pictures and video clips still remain on her Facebook account.“This year in January, Chinese troops came along with their trained dogs in our territory and warned our nomadic people not to graze herds in their own land and said if they (nomads) did so they will take them away,” she had said in a post.In another post with pictures, she said her maternal uncle Rigzin lost his ancestral shed at Laegoknonboo because PLA pushed him 50 steps back. “So imagine how many square km we lost.”“On July 6, 2019, the Chinese PLA came 6km into our territory and unfurled their flag and went back and later in December 2019, they claimed the adjoining territory as theirs,” she wrote on Facebook.She recalled how Ladakhi herdsmen had to shift their ancestral shed 50 steps back from where they were.The BJP chairperson had also shared a picture of a road project being constructed by the Chinese in May 2019.“This macadamised road was constructed by the Chinese communist govt in May 2019 and I took the photo in December. China constructed this road with almost 150 heavy vehicles under our very nose at Fukgap. What we did nothing and what strategies we laid for our border. But on the other hand in Demchok, we have to get permission from DC even for the movement of one JCB. Where is our strategy,” she had asked in another Facebook post.“Whatever is happening in Galwan valley is nothing new and it’s happening because of lack of concern and strategies for border areas,” she had said on June 11.On April 27 when Urgain had first flagged the intensified Chinese activity, BJP MP Jamyang Tsering Namgyal had told HT that the “chairperson’s messages were sent to the ministries concerned”.“There is something fishy and the government needs to investigate it,” she had told HT then.However, Ladakh’s divisional commissioner Saugat Biswas had dubbed Urgain’s claims as “unverified reports”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/galwan-face-off-nyoma-block-chief-had-flagged-chinese-activity-in-eastern-ladakh-several-times/story-gTP839VnRx0CN4HMq9egPP.html
17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana doctors to observe ‘medical bandh’ on June 23||Even as hospitals grapple with Covid-19 cases, Ludhiana doctors have decided to observe a complete medical bandh June 23 to protest against the implementation the Clinical Establishment Act (CEA) being enforced from July 1.The Ludhiana branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) on Tuesday burnt the copies of the act.Calling it a “wrongly timed act and completely uncalled for,” Dr Sunil Katyal , president, IMA Ludhiana , said doctors were governed by Punjab Medical Council (PMC), National Medical Council (NMC/MCI) rules and hospital buildings were governed by building regulation/norms. Many hospitals were getting accredited by National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH). “The introduction of this act will achieve nothing extra, except for the harassment of doctors,” he said.Dr Dheeraj Aggarwal, honorary secretary, IMA Ludhiana, also said the act was against people, patients, the poor and doctors. It will lead to increase in hospital and treatment costs. The private health care delivery in Punjab is already of high quality, as witnessed by the fact that more than 70% patients seek treatment from private setups than from government hospitals, he said.The states where it has been implemented did not show any improvement in health care delivery, he added.Dr Manoj K Sobti, co -chairman, joint action committee, Punjab State governing Council, said, “We are opposing this act completely. Today a Memorandum was given to additional deputy commissioner Ludhiana AS Bains and it will be given to various leaders and the officials in the administration. The IMA Punjab has announced complete medical bandh June 23 if their demands were not met. If the government will not address their problem then a meeting will be held to June 28 to discuss the future course of action,” he added.The Act provides for registration and regulation of all clinical establishments in the country with a view to prescribing minimum standards of facilities and services which may be provided by them so that mandate of article 47 of the Constitution for improvement in public health is achieved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-doctors-to-observe-medical-bandh-on-june-23/story-bW6p708Vg2wJHmIT6qGaJL.html
17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Time for stringent steps to stop Chinese belligerence, says Capt Amarinder||Hours after the Indian Army said on Tuesday that an officer and two men were killed in a clash with Chinese soldiers in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh urged the Centre to take “some stringent measures” to stop Chinese belligerence.“It is time now for the Govt of India to take some stringent measures. Each sign of weakness on our part makes the Chinese reaction more belligerent. I join the nation in paying tribute to our brave martyrs. The nation stands with you in your hour of grief,” Captain Amarinder tweeted.A former soldier, the chief minister said it is time now for the country to stand up to Chinese incursions.“The happening in the #Galwanvalley is a continuation of violations by China. It is time now that the country stands up to these incursions. Our soldiers are not fair game that every few days officers and men are being killed and injured defending our borders,” he said in another tweet.Separately, the Congress has described the death of Indian soldiers in eastern Ladakh as shocking, unbelievable and unacceptable.The party also said the government must come forward to explain the circumstances of the latest development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/time-for-stringent-steps-to-stop-chinese-belligerence-says-capt-amarinder/story-2MQ5FqWzXvVgTWnWUXPZsN.html
17-06-2020||City||India-China stand-off: J&K opposition leaders take swipe at BJP for ‘inept’ handling of border tension||The opposition leaders in Jammu and Kashmir on Tuesday took a swipe at the Bharatiya Janata Party government at the Centre for its ‘inept’ handling of the border issue while strongly condemning the stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Galwan valley.The Indian army has suffered multiple casualties, including that of an officer, in the “violent face off” with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in eastern Ladakh, the army said in a statement on Tuesday. It added that there were casualties on both sides.Peoples’ Democratic Party (PDP) general secretary and a close confidante of Mehbooba Mufti, Ved Mahajan said, “We strongly condemn the killings of a senior rank officer and two soldiers in Ladakh. It is a big incident and our armed forces should avenge these killings. There should be a tit for tat. This is not 1962, this is 2020. The time has come to prove it practically”.PDP president Mehbooba Mufti also took to Twitter to condemn the incident. “Seems like China has hijacked the aggressive ‘ghar main ghuske marengay’ militaristic approach. Nation deserves to know why there is no talk of retaliation to avenge the death of three Indian army personnel!”, said Mehbooba, whose Twitter handle is used by her daughter Iltija Mufti.Jammu and Kashmir Pradesh Congress Committee (JKPCC) chief Ghulam Ahmed Mir said, “The Modi government showed great postures towards China in the past six years. From tea, coffee, breakfast, dinner and swings, everything was organised but today the ground situation is totally different. They are intruding our territory. It has become a routine and now this incident has escalated tension.”Mir said, “China may have had its compulsions to divert attention from Covid-19 deaths in their country but India should create goodwill to save its people from death and destruction. The issue has to be resolved politically”.“The government has not been able to resolve the issue. Protecting the nation’s sovereignty is the government’s duty. If it is not resolved politically, then there should be a directive to the armed forces to secure our land. There should not be a stand-off,” Mir added.Former chief minister and National Conference (NC) vice-president Omar Abdullah also took to Twitter to talk about the incident. “If the Chinese shoot dead an Indian army colonel and two jawans during a “de-escalation process” imagine how escalated the situation must be in the first place. This is what happens when the media propagates the government line that asking questions is anti-national,” he tweeted.NC provincial president Devender Singh Rana said,“Disturbing reports coming in from Ladakh. While de-escalation is the key here, violence against our citizens and our armed forces is unacceptable. We stand by the family of those martyred and pray for the safety of our brothers and sisters in Ladakh. May we emerge from this victorious and with utmost dignity.” CPI (M) leader Mohammad Yusuf Tarigami said, “It is unfortunate that a clash took place during the de-escalation process on the Line of Actual Control in Ladakh. This has taken place after talks between the two sides at a high military level began on June 6 to discuss the process of disengagement. I express my deep condolences at the death of an Indian Army officer and two soldiers”.“The government should come out with an authoritative statement as to what actually happened. It is imperative that both the governments immediately initiate high-level talks to defuse the situation and advance the process of disengagement on the basis of agreed understanding on maintaining peace and tranquility on the border,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/india-china-stand-off-j-k-opposition-leaders-take-swipe-at-bjp-for-inept-handling-of-border-tension/story-3ZMFUg4BrQqqrdukpXqbBM.html

17-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab CM calls for strong Indian response to incursions by China||Expressing anger over the clash in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, which led the Indian Army to lose three brave personnel, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Tuesday called for a strong response from the Government of India to the repeated violations of the Indian territory by the Chinese.“Our soldiers are not fair game that every few days officers and men should be killed or injured defending our borders,” a furious Captain Amarinder said, reacting strongly to the development, which came even as the armies on the two sides were supposed to be in the process of disengagement from a tense stand-off of the past several days.“It is time now for India to stand up to these repeated incursions that are a blatant violation of our territorial rights and put a stop to such attacks on our territorial integrity,” said the chief minister, asserting that every sign of weakness on the part of India makes the Chinese reaction more belligerent.While it was important to defuse the tensions at the border, and India was not in favour of war, Captain Amarinder said the country could not afford to show weakness at this time and needed to take a strong stand to deter the Chinese from any further intrusions and attacks on its territories and men.SEND OUT STRONG MESSAGEEven after brutally beating the Indian Army commanding officer and two soldiers to death, Beijing was feigning innocence, and trying to put the blame on India, accusing it of provoking the conflict through “unilateral actions”, the chief minister pointed out.Such reaction on the part of China was typical of its duplicity, he said, adding that the escalation of tensions in the Ladakh sector of the Indo-China border were the direct consequence of the incursions by Chinese troops into Indian territory.The Chinese actions were in direction violation of all treaties signed between the two countries and a brazen assault on Indian integrity, said Captain Amarinder, urging the central government to take suitable steps to send out a strong message that it would not take such attacks lying down.TAKING ADVANTAGE OF COVID CRISISReferring to the rising tensions at the Indo-Pak and Indo-Nepal borders also in the recent weeks, the chief minister said the country was clearly surrounded by forces seeking to destabilise its peace by taking advantage of the Covid-19 crisis. “Let them be warned that India will not compromise on national security at any cost, and is capable of combating external challenges even as it continues to battle the pandemic internally,” he asserted.Paying tributes to the soldiers who had lost their lives in the Galwan Valley violence, Captain Amarinder said the nation stands with the Indian Army in this hour of grief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-cm-calls-for-strong-indian-response-to-incursions-by-china/story-Hi5bd5JNpWXkGnjhNWthoL.html

The contents of the video being circulated are not authenticated. Attempt to link it with the situation on the Northern borders is malafide. Currently, no violence is happening. Differences are being addressed through interaction between military commanders, guided by established protocols on the management of borders between the two countries. We strongly condemn attempts to sensationalise issues impacting national security. The media is requested not to air visuals that are likely to vitiate the current situation on the borders,” read the statement issued by a spokesperson of the Army.For the past three weeks, both the nuke countries were engaged in a stand-off in Pangong Tso, Galwan Valley, Demchok and Daulat Beg Oldie in eastern Ladakh, in what is turning out to be the biggest confrontation between the two countries after the Doklam episode in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/army-rejects-purported-video-of-eastern-ladakh-face-off/story-2ysQZXPQ096zRfSyPRUDBO.html
