01-06-2020||City||Liquor shops get nod to open two hours extra till 9pm||Ghaziabad: The Uttar Pradesh government on Monday gave its nod to open the liquor shops from 10am to 9pm across the state, barring those which are in containment zones. The decision is likely to benefit about 800 shops in Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar districts. The previous timings for the liquor stores were from 10am to 7pm. In its guidelines issued on Sunday, the UP government had directed for opening of markets from 9am to 9pm.“The liquor shops which opened earlier from 10am to 7pm will now open from 10am to 9pm. These will exclude liquor shops which fall under the containment zones. The directions will be applicable for all districts,” said Sanjay R Bhoosreddy, principal secretary of UP excise department.Officials said that the revised timings will be applicable for shops of country liquor, Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) and beer shops, including the model shops which are located outside the containment zones.There are about 460 liquor shops in Ghaziabad, including about 60 falling under the containment zones/hotspot areas, while 371 of 481 are presently open in Gautam Budh Nagar district.The liquor sales are a major revenue generator for the government, and generate a revenue of about Rs 30,000 crore annually. Official sources of the excise department said that the revenue proposed for the current financial year is about Rs 36,000 crore.However, the liquor sales have seen a sharp decline as shops were directed to close down in UP in the wake of lockdown imposed in the last week of March. “As per our estimates, the sales of beer have come down to 10% while those of foreign liquor and country made liquor have come down to about 20% and 30%, respectively. The sales of beer have been largely affected as people have been advised against taking cold items or beverages to prevent aggravation by Covid-19,” the officer added.In order to boost sales, the state cabinet on May 23 approved the ‘Uttar Pradesh Excise (Settlement of Licences for Premium Retail Vends of Foreign Liquor) Rules, 2020’ which mandates sales of premium liquor brands in shopping malls, departmental stores and supermarkets.The officials said that arrangement is likely to start in the next two months after the modalities are finalised for the license fees and lockdown conditions get relaxed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-shops-get-nod-to-open-two-hours-extra-till-9pm/story-t7BuHOiLyUMYyEbNgfUIhO.html

The Switzerland company Zurich International AG is likely to start work at the site by the end of August as it has received security clearance and fulfilled other formalities by now.The administration has already acquired and transferred 1,334 hectares of land for the airport project. At least 3,000 families are to be rehabilitated in this township.The administration will develop the township and provide residential plots to farmers who gave their land for the airport project. It will also pay compensation and provide other benefits to those farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nodal-officials-appointed-to-survey-land-earmarked-for-farmers-who-gave-theirs-for-jewar-airport/story-g4Gez5h7ik7l2MJSCE5QqM.html

01-06-2020||Noida||UP government releases guidelines for opening of offices, social distancing a must||The Uttar Pradesh health department has issued guidelines for commercial, industrial and other offices to follow standard operating procedures as they slowly decide to resume operations under Unlock 1 — under which all kinds of businesses are being allowed to start operating phase-wise. All the firm owners will have to ensure that workers wash hands, use sanitizers and maintain social distancing, among other measures, in order to protect against Covid 19 infection.Amit Mohan Prasad, principal secretary of Uttar Pradesh government’s health department has asked all district magistrates — including Gautam Budh Nagar — to ensure compliance of guidelines in order to prevent the spread of Covid 19 infection.“The nationwide lockdown implemented to prevent the spread of Covid-19 is being lifted in phases to allow offices to start functioning again. As a result, work is being resumed at construction sites, work places and at offices. Contact among workers will now increase as will the risk of spread of the infection. Therefore, precautions are required to be exercised at all workplaces,” said Amit Mohan Prasad principal secretary with UP government.The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration also said that it was geared up to implement the instructions of the state government. “We have issued instructions asking people to follow all instructions at workplace and at offices,” said Suhas LY district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.The instructions, which are to be followed, include washing of hands for workers, providing sanitizers, thermal screening, sanitization of touch points like door handles, taps, lift buttons, maintaining distance of two yards between workers and social distancing during lunch breaks, among other steps. “The workers need to wear masks, greet with namaskar instead of shaking hands, stop sharing tobacco products at workplace, avoid touching mouth or nose and taking care of other basic hygiene. The workers are advised to inform the health department immediately if they suffer from fever or cough,” said Prasad.The UP government has asked the owners of industrial units to maintain a register of all employees, along with mobile numbers so that the health department can contact in case of an emergency. Pregnant women have been advised not to be allowed to resume work during this time so that they can stay away from the infection. In a 100 seater bus, only 50 workers can travel, said the guidelines. If workers are found positive with Covid-19, then the office or unit in question will be shut down for 24 hours. And all workers will be put in 14 days quarantine.“We have advised all factory and industrial unit owners to follow the guidelines strictly so that we manage tokeep workers safe at their workplaces,” said Vipin Malhan, president of Noida Entrepreneur association (NEA), a group of industrial units.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-government-releases-guidelines-for-opening-of-offices-social-distancing-a-must/story-PETRFzQqmv3Cvcl8Q5aaVM.html
01-06-2020||City||Noida girl donates savings to help three migrants fly back home||Noida: A 12-year-old city girl has donated more than Rs 48,000 to help a family of three migrants stuck in Delhi go back to their native place in Jharkhand.The girl, Niharika Dwivedi, is a resident of a high-rise in Sector 50 and a class 8 student of a private school.According to her parents, she had been deeply affected by the plight of migrants for the past few weeks.“The footage of a toddler trying to wake up his dead mother on the railway platform was just one of the few videos that had Niharika anxious about the migrant workers. She was willing to contribute in some manner. We are proud of her for helping out in any manner whatsoever,” said Surabhi Dwivedi, the girl’s mother.Niharika has earned accolades from Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren for her noble gesture. According to a statement from the CM’s office, Soren appreciated the gesture and said he was grateful to the girl for her sensitivity to the needs of others and wished her a bright future.To reach out to the migrant family, Niharika’s parents helped her get in touch with a non-government organisation (NGO).“In the time of Covid-19 pandemic, there are so many people out there who need help. After my parents contacted the NGO, we got to know about a family of three migrants, including a young child, who were stuck at a shelter home in Delhi’s Yusuf Sarai during the lockdown. One of them is even suffering from cancer. They wanted to go back to their hometown in Jharkhand. So, we got them air tickets to go back home,” said Niharika.An avid dancer, Niharika had Rs 48,530 in her ‘piggy bank’ which she decided to donate for helping the migrants leave Delhi on Sunday.“A big chunk of the amount was given by her grandparents or relatives that she had been saving for the past few years. The rest of the money she had won in dance competitions,” said the mother.The mother further said that the migrants, who worked as daily wager, lived in the Yusuf Sarai area before moving into the shelter home. They had also sold part of their property in Jharkhand for the cancer treatment last year, she added.Niharika hopes to help out further in whatever way she can and wants to make her career in civil services.In April this year, Noida-based young golfer Arjun Bhati, who have won the junior world championship in 2018 and 2019, had donated Rs 4.3 lakh to the PM Cares fund set up by PM Narendra Modi to deal with the Covid-19 crisis. Interestingly, the 15-year-old golfer raised the amount by selling his 102 trophies which he had won in the past several years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-girl-donates-savings-to-help-three-migrants-fly-back-home/story-NbX7mYNQ0SovFFGNGy5FaM.html
01-06-2020||Noida||Noida: Shoppers back in markets, e-rickshaws back on roads as life limps back to normalcy||With more relaxations in the nationwide lockdown being announced on Monday, life is slowly bouncing back to normal as people return to markets, e-rickshaws and autos start ferrying passengers and vehicular traffic returns to what it used to be during a weekday before the Covid-19 pandemic hit the country.As the curfew timings were changed from 7pm to 7am to 9pm to 5am, markets are remaining open for two extra hours. Traders say that while a complete restoration of business may still take a while longer, the fresh timings will be helpful in regaining some of the lost business.“The markets are allowed to be open from 9am to 9pm, as per the government orders,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.However, confusion over the odd-even pattern system for shops to open in markets prevailed among many.“The businessmen had been asked to remain patient, and we know that the recovery of the losses will take time. But now since the curfew timings have been reduced, it will be easy for our shoppers to visit markets in the evening and not brave the daytime temperatures. In a way, we can say this is a prelude of normalcy,” said Sushil Kumar Jain, president, Sector 18 market association.While certain enterprises such as saloons, parlours and malls are yet to open, shopkeepers are now being extra cautious about maintaining social distancing and allowing only limited people inside stores or at cash counters at a time.“On Monday, more shops have opened, and people have also started coming out. We see the maximum crowd towards the evening, so we have to ensure that no more than four customers enter the store at a time. People are cooperative and are ensuring social distancing,” Gauri Shankar, a general store owner in Sector 77, said.“More and more people are returning to the market, however their demand is specifi -- most of our customers are demanding dumbbells and other gym equipment believing that gyms will be the last to open,” said a sport shop owner in Sector 18. At Rajnigandha Chowk, near Sector 16, a number of e-rickshaws were seen carrying a maximum of three passengers unlike days prior to the lockdown clampdown on March 25, when they would ferry at least five to six at a time. “There is no pressure and we have not been told anything, but people are themselves insisting on not carrying more than three passengers at a time, otherwise we would take at least five passengers,” said Lalit Kumar, an e-rickshaw driver.Roadside ice-cream vendors, nurseries, clay goods sellers, furniture sellers, etc., near Brahmputra Market in Sector 29, Bhangel, and Sector 51, among others, have also started setting up shops after over 60 days. The auto market in Sector 16 is also largely operational.“Monday seemed like any other day, as the number of customers were what it used to be during a normal day before lockdown. We serviced many cars, wheels alignment and tyre changes. There are more and more customers whose cars need servicing,” said Vishal Dang, who owns a tyre and auto repairs shop in Hoshiyarpur, Sector 51.A few roadside eateries and dhabas also started operations from Monday, though the day was not promising for them.“We have had only three customers since morning and they were all non-locals -- factory workers and such. We only have takeaways for now,” said Dharmendra Yadav, who owned a popular dhaba in Sector 51.With the crowds gathering strength, police are also more vigilant. “There are personnel at all those places where there is possibility of crowding and we are ensuring social distancing,” said Sankalp Sharma, DCP Zone 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-shoppers-back-in-markets-e-rickshaws-back-on-roads-as-life-limps-back-to-normalcy/story-Z1Vvv8ymj1ye8Hpp3o9IrO.html
01-06-2020||City||UPSRTC initiates intra-state operations from Ghaziabad; 232 samples taken from Vaishali on day 1 of sealing||Ghaziabad: The Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) on Monday initiated the commercial operations of about 500 buses from the Ghaziabad region for different cities and towns in the state. About 180 state-run buses departed to various destinations till Monday evening, officials said, adding that online reservation facility will also be available from Tuesday.The commercial operation of buses was started after the state government on Sunday rolled out the plan to open up activities in accordance with the May 30 directions of the Union ministry of home affairs, which has allowed inter-state and intra-state movement. On Sunday, the UP officials had said that UPSRTC would initiate intra-state operations.“About 180 buses departed till Monday evening and we are expecting more response on Tuesday. Closing of borders by Delhi will not affect us much and our buses, which earlier also operated from Anand Vihar, will now depart from the nearby Kaushambi area. So, people of Delhi can come to the border on foot and board buses to their home towns. Since we have started the commercial operations, the passengers are now charged the normal fares for travel,” said AK Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC.The buses, which left Ghaziabad on Monday, departed for different cities, including Lucknow, Gorakhpur, Bareilly, Shahjahanpur, Farukkhabad, Kasganj, Etah, and Mainpuri, among others.The Ghaziabad region operates 980 buses, including luxurious and Pink Line Women-only ones, to different cities in Uttar Prdesh and other states like Delhi, Bihar and Uttarakhand, among others.“We did not rope in high-end Volvo and Scania buses on Monday, while Pink Line Women-only buses and normal AC buses departed. The buses left with seating capacity of 50 passengers who were properly screened with infrared thermometer and nobody was allowed to board without mask. There are strict directions that only seating will be allowed and no one should travel standing,” Singh added.Hundreds of passengers arrived at Kaushambi and maintained social distancing as the UPSRTC staff asked them to sanitize their hands and details of every passenger were noted down.Dinesh Kashyap, a passenger at Kaushambi, said, “It took some time to board the bus due to several precautions like social distancing, screening, etc. The staff also noted down personal details like addresses and mobile number of every passenger on board. Since I could not get a train ticket, I preferred to travel by bus to my home town.” Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home), said directions have been given for surveillance and tracking of passengers.“Since the train services have also started, we have proposed to give handbills to every passenger about precautions to be taken against Coronavirus. We have also written to the chairman of the Railway Board in this regard. At every station, there will be deployment of police and health department teams who will monitor passengers,” he added.232 samples taken from VaishaliMeanwhile, the Ghaziabad district administration on Monday implemented its ‘sector scheme’ to seal Vaishali, which is now divided into two administrative zones and four sectors.“We have deployed a three-member team comprising a doctor, a lab technician and a pharmacist in each sector to take up sampling and surveillance in households. On the first day, 232 samples were taken from Vaishali. Each team has been given a target to cover 150 households,” said a statement from the district magistrate’s office.“An ambulance has been kept ready in each sector to deal with any emergency. Extensive sanitization by three fire tenders and fogging activity by the municipal corporation were also undertaken. The district magistrate has given instruction for strict implementation of sector scheme in Vaishali,” the statement said.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls on Monday.Till May 31, the total number of Covid-19 cases stood at 34 in Vaishali. The sealing activity in the locality was initiated on Monday in order to keep in check rising number of cases. A similar sealing is already in place in Khoda since May 10 and in Loni since May 27.According to official records, 15 cases came from Khoda till May 9 after which the sector scheme was initiated on May 10. Thereafter, 25 more cases have emerged from Khoda. Likewise, in Loni which saw about 22 cases till May 26, six more have come till May 31 after sealing was put in place on May 27.“The Covid-19 cases are still coming in from Khoda and Loni, and positive cases may continue to come from Vaishali also. But our teams are trying to contain any spread further. This is why the sector scheme has been initiated in Vaishali. People having symptoms like fever, cough and cold, etc, will be screened by out teams and appropriate treatment will be provided,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/upsrtc-initiates-intra-state-operations-from-ghaziabad-232-samples-taken-from-vaishali-on-day-1-of-sealing/story-7y3pvRWRKvb6IKR47X6CBL.html
01-06-2020||Noida||Lockdown 5.0: No respite from traffic at borders||Traffic remained chaotic across Noida-Delhi borders on Monday even as the country moved on to the fifth phase of the lockdown.“It took me over two hours to reach Noida’s Sector 18 from Greater Kailash in Delhi via the DND Flyway. The police checked every vehicle for a valid pass and ID while only one lane was operational. Vehicular movement has been slow due to checking for the past few days, but this morning it was worse than usual. There were more vehicles on the road, which led to the traffic crawling even slower,” Rishi Oswal, a business owner who commutes to Noida every day, said.During the past phases of the nationwide lockdown imposed to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, even as Delhi permitted certain relaxations, commuters had alleged that the Noida police were a lot stricter concerning cross-border movement.“However, today (Monday) morning it was bad on both sides (of the border). While crossing the Noida gate towards Delhi, there are barricades in place that slow down the traffic considerably, even though the Delhi Police rarely bother to check permits. I left my house in Noida around 8.20am but reached my workplace in Delhi only around 10am. The situation is equally bad while getting into Noida. Even though I have a pass, many others don’t. They argue with the police who check each vehicle, making it a very slow process. It’s been over two months now. They should have allotted designated lanes for people with passes to keep the traffic moving steadily. There is also a disconnect between the issue of regulations and information to the public,” Anil Arora, a commuter from Sector 50, said.Commuters allege that the situation is just as bad as it was before, with more traffic on the roads.“The regulations have not changed in weeks. Why people go out despite that is unfathomable. They argue and hold up traffic which would otherwise move steadily. Most of these people do not have requisite permissions,” a senior police officer said, requesting anonymity.The police, however, believe that the situation will improve at the border now that Delhi has also decided to seal its borders.“We hope that the traffic volume will go down by almost 50% after both sides seal the border from both ends. That will go a long way in tackling the traffic menace at any chokepoint,” deputy commissioner of police, traffic, Rajesh S, said.Traffic at Mayur Vihar-Sector 14 A (Chilla) border is slightly less compared to that on DND Flyway and Kalindi Kunj.“We keep opening more lanes depending on what the situation warrants. There is steadily moving traffic in Chilla. Even at the other two places, traffic is not stalled, just slow. With Delhi also now closing its borders, the situation should become much better,” DCP, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma, said.So far only people with administrative passes, medical personnel, Delhi High Court lawyers, passengers with confirmed rail or air tickets, and emergency vehicles are allowed to cross the border. The police often turn back the remaining people.The lockdown had first been announced on March 24 to tackle the pandemic in India. The district had sealed its border with Delhi in April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/lockdown-5-0-no-respite-from-traffic-at-borders/story-vGaWwhUhfT2E6mmB4dTAIL.html
01-06-2020||City||Noida: One booked for taking samples illegally; Covid-19 count reaches 470||NOIDA: Two days after six private laboratories operating in Delhi-NCR were served notices for giving ‘false’ Covid-19 positive reports to eight persons in Gautam Budh Nagar, a person was booked on Monday for illegally collecting samples on the behalf of a Delhi-based private laboratory, district administration officials said.GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said that during a routine inspection of hospitals, the district medical officials found that one person was collecting nasopharyngeal samples of patients in front of a hospital in Sector 30. “On inquiry, it was found that he was allegedly working for a New Delhi-based private laboratory. It has been reported that he was collecting samples for Covid-19 tests. He used to travel on a two-wheeler with collection apparatus on it. He was also found flouting bio-medical waste management rules as well as all norms of sample collection for Covid-19 patients,” Suhas said.The DM further said that an FIR against him has been lodged with Sector 20 police station. “As per notifications issued by ICMR, only those laboratories are allowed to collect samples, which have valid collection centres in the area. This person was collecting samples in the district without having a valid collection centre. We have also asked the hospitals and health establishments to operate in accordance with bio-medical waste management rules. Stern action will be taken in case of violation,” he said.Covid count reaches 470Meanwhile, GB Nagar reported 17 new Covid-19 cases on Monday, taking the tally of positive cases to 470 in the district. However, five patients were discharged after being cured from the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, health officials said. Of the 17 new cases, six patients are from Bhangel and remaining 11 are from different parts of the district. According to district surveillance officer Dr Sunil Dohre, of 470 positive cases till Monday evening, 299 patients have been discharged from different hospitals. “Seven patients have so far lost their lives and 29 have been cross-notified from other districts and states. As a result, the district now has 164 active cases,” Dohre said.Giving details of the 29 cross-notified Covid-19 cases, the district surveillance officer said that while 13 of them are from Delhi, one patient each from West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh has also been cross-notified. “While one patient has a duplicate entry in the log, the remaining 13 are from other districts of Uttar Pradesh, including six from Bulanshahr, four from Ghaziabad, two from Hapur and one from Agra,” he said.Dohre further said that health camps were organised in 12 sensitive places in the district on Sunday, including at Mamura, Nithari, Sarfabad, Harola, sectors 8, 9 and 10. “A total of 673 patients were screened today and 11 of them, who had symptoms of fever, have been referred to the district hospital,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-one-booked-for-taking-samples-illegally-covid-19-count-reaches-470/story-SxE76RQQHl7g6eCVPV66rM.html

01-06-2020||Delhi||NDMC records first Covid death of staff as virus kills two more civic body workers||A 31-year-old sanitation worker of New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) succumbed to Covid-19 on Sunday, officials of the civic body said..According to NDMC officials, this is the first Covid-19 death reported from the civic body. A senior NDMC official said that the man had last attended office on May 23 and succumbed to the virus on Sunday. “On May 23, he told his colleagues that he was going home as he was not feeling well. On May 28, he got himself tested at BLK Hospital and a day later he was found Covid-19 positive. He was then admitted at RML Hospital where he died on May 31,” the official, said requesting anonymity. The deceased was deployed at NDMC’s drainage service centre in Netaji Nagar. He is survived by his wife and two children — a four-year-old son and a three-month-old daughter. The civic body has announced a compensation of Rs 15 lakh to the family of the employee.The official said that contact tracing of staff in contact with the man is yet to be conducted. The deceased was appointed as a “Beldaar“ at the Netaji Nagar drainage service centre and was engaged in desilting drains.“We have no idea how was he contracted the virus. There are around 42 people who work at the office. I have written to the senior authorities in NDMC to start contact tracing of all the staff members so that people who had come in contact with the deceased can be identified and quarantined. Around 5-6 of his colleagues, with whom the deceased used to clean drains, have been asked to quarantine themselves,” an official at Netaji Nagar drainage service centre, said.In the last two months, a total of 33 Covid-19 positive cases has been reported from areas under NDMC’s jurisdiction.

01-06-2020||Gurugram||Thieves steal ₹42.39 lakh from ATM||Unidentified thieves allegedly stole ₹42.39 lakh from an automated teller machine (ATM) in a shopping complex in Sushant Lok, the police said on Sunday. The police said the suspects were yet to be identified. They said that according to the preliminary probe, two masked men had entered the ATM kiosk on the afternoon of May 23 and tampered with the CCTV camera in the kiosk, eventually decamping with the cash. According to the police, a Sector 55-based cash management company had replenished the ATM with ₹28 lakh in cash on May 20. The police said that three days later, the company received information that the machine was not operational due to a technical fault. Girish Pal Singh, the complainant, said, “After the complaint, we conducted an enquiry and found that ₹42,39,100 was missing from the account during an audit on May 29. We also recovered footage from the CCTV camera, in which two masked men could be seen entering the kiosk and taping the camera lens on May 23 around 2.30pm. The same day, we received a complaint stating that the machine was not working.”The police said they received information of the incident on Sunday and the complainant handed over the CCTV camera footage. A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said that the thieves did not use a gas cutter to steal the cash from the ATM. “The initial probe suggests that the suspects used a hacking device. We have sent the CCTV camera footage for forensic analysis and are trying to trace the suspects,” the police officer said, adding that they were probing whether the theft was an ‘inside job’.The police registered a case against the suspects under Section 380 (theft in dwelling house) of the Indian Penal Code at the Sector 29 police station on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/thieves-steal-42-39-lakh-from-atm/story-fC8ED9dLyK11LuvTX5HRMP.html
01-06-2020||Gurugram||City auto drivers stare at a bleak future||Auto-rickshaws have slowly begun returning to the city streets over the past two weeks, ever since the beginning of Lockdown 4.0, which began on May 17. However, several of them, on Monday, said they are earning very little, and that they do not see any hopes of a financial recovery at least for the next year. According to Yogesh Sharma, state general secretary, Haryana Auto Chalak Sanghatan, “Most auto drivers do not own the vehicles they drive. The daily rent for an auto, depending on its condition and mileage, is between ₹300 and ₹500 per day. Add to that another ₹200 to ₹300 for fuel. However, these days, auto drivers are unable to earn anything more than ₹400 a day, if at all. This does not cover even their basic costs. As such, only those who are working with app-based services or those who own their independent vehicles are plying.” Sharma said in the days following the lockdown, he was flooded with several calls from distressed auto drivers who were trying to find their way back to their home states. Before the outbreak, Sharma estimated that there were anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 autos plying in the district on a daily basis. “At least one-third of these drivers have simply packed up and gone home. Unions leaders have been in talks with some of the drivers in Gurugram and Faridabad. However, it does not seem like things will pick up financially until the next year or so,” Sharma said. With most people preferring to commute via private cabs or their own personal vehicles — as evidenced in a recent public perception survey in Delhi-NCR by the Centre for Science and Energy — the demand for autos has fallen to unprecedented levels, drivers said. “Our main source of passengers were Metro commuters and tenants living in rented accommodations. But many people have returned home now. Work has completely dried up. If I am lucky, my daily earnings will come to ₹200 but not more,” said Javed Uddin, an auto driver residing in Nathupur village. Auto drivers have currently pinned their hopes on the Delhi Metro, which they hope will resume soon. “If that happens, then we will be able to find passengers along the MG Road Corridor, from Guru Dronacharya to Huda City Centre Metro station. But if the Metro doesn’t start soon, things will be difficult,” said Uddin.The few auto drivers who are still plying, however, are going the extra mile to protect themselves and commuters from the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Several of them said they have equipped themselves with masks, hand sanitisers and disinfectants and have also installed protective plastic screens in their vehicles to keep themselves and passengers separated. Many others said they have begun accepting digital payments to minimise contact with commuters.A majority of these drivers are affiliated with private cab aggregators. “The companies have been providing us with sanitisers and disinfectants,” said Sudhir, an autorickshaw driver and an Uttar Pradesh native, who went only by his first name. Sudhir said he has been sanitising his vehicle twice a day with alcohol-based disinfectant and insists on commuters wearing masks and using hand sanitiser before entering his vehicle. Lalit Kumar, a driver from Patna, Bihar, said, “Earlier, I had not installed the plastic sheet in my auto-rickshaw. But then I saw that police were issuing challans for not adhering to social distancing norms. So, I used hoarding material from a discarded board and put it up in the auto, which now separates the space between my seat and that of the passenger. I also purchased gloves. I did not want to lose my customers. If they think I am not taking precautions, they will not get in.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/city-auto-drivers-stare-at-a-bleak-future/story-CzF5Wn8DlxE35HebBZmxIP.html
01-06-2020||Gurugram||Health department directs private labs to fall in line||As the number of people infected with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continues to swell with the total count reaching 903 on Monday evening, a delay of at least three days by private laboratories in the city in delivering the Covid-19 test reports to the patients and the district health department is adding to the challenges being faced by the administration in controlling the spread of the infectious disease, officials said.Earlier this week, the district administration and health department held a meeting with representatives of private lab directing them to streamline the testing process and share the test reports on time.On May 28, the health department issued a notice to CORE diagnostic lab for not submitting the complete test results of Covid-19 positive patient on time. The notice stated that a sample was sent to the lab on May 22 and the health department received the test result on May 28 only after repeated calls were made to the private lab. The notice further stated that the lab was not following government’s instruction on sharing Covid-19 test results.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer, said, “We have not received a response from CORE diagnostic lab yet. We have observed that many private labs were conducting tests without collecting the proper ID proof of the patient, or even complete addresses of the patients, and the labs were not uploading the reports on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal on time. They are taking at least three days to deliver the results. We are working to streamline the process to prevent further spread of the disease.” CORE Diagnostics, however, said they its response to the government. “We have responded to the government’s notice saying that the report in question was sent on time. The government is satisfied with our response. In this time of crisis, we are actively working with the government, hospitals, and health care workers to ensure patients get excellent service. We are fully compliant with all government guidelines and protocols for Covid-19 testing,” said Zoya Brar, founder, and chief executive officer, CORE Diagnostics.There are seven private labs in Gurugram who are approved by ICMR to conduct Covid-19 tests.Data shows nearly 43% of the samples collected in Gurugram have been tested in private labs. From April 9 to May 31, at least 7,231 samples have been tested by the government labs and 5,357 by private labs. “As per the protocol, labs have to put the test reports on the ICMR portal. What has been happening in Gurugram is that the lab reports are reaching the patients first, and then to the health department which delays the process of tracing the direct and indirect contacts of the patients. A delay of one day doesn’t matter much, but a delay of three days increases the chances of the highly infectious disease spreading further to others in the patient’s family,” said a member of the district’s rapid response team, who is privy to the matter. According to official data, one Covid-19 patient in Gurugram has affected at least two people on an average, and to three people in many cases. The state and district health departments, however, refused to share the details of the infection rate called RO(pronounced as R-naught). The RO is a unit used to measure the number of new infections generated by each case.Upon the last calculation by ICMR in April, the national RO value was 2.5. Also, an ICMR study in April predicted that a Covid-19 patient can infect 406 people in 30 days if preventive measures such as lockdown and social distancing are not implemented. A senior state official said, “Government teams are ensuring that the suspected patient puts himself/herself under quarantine until test reports come. Private labs also cannot let go of the suspected patients after taking their swab samples. Once the test reports come, they are required to inform the patients and the district health team. However, in many cases, a delay in reporting to the health officials was reported. It is for this reason that we have directed the private labs to follow the standard operating procedures (SOP) for sample testing which includes, timely test results and sharing the data on ICMR portal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/health-department-directs-private-labs-to-fall-in-line/story-Kvb2A0IykrwWL8K5o4c6GM.html

01-06-2020||Gurugram||DTCP makes stilt parking compulsory for construction of 3rd and 4th floors||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) has revised the rules for construction on plots in private colonies and HSVP sectors. It has now made stilt parking mandatory for the construction of third and fourth floors in towns falling under hyper-potential category i.e. Gurugram Manesar Urban Complex. For other towns in the state, stilt parking shall be mandatory for construction of the 4th floor. The department said that this rule would be applied with prospective effect for the approval of all new building plans for vacant plots or when a plot is proposed to be reconstructed.Prior to this order, the stilt construction was mandatory only if a plot owner constructed the fourth floor, said officials.The department has also issued directions that plot owners will have to seek approval for the car-parking on the ground floor as per the size of the plot. Officials said that a number of violations were committed under the stilts. Small rooms or additional rooms, which were not part of the building plan were often constructed by owners or developers in violation of the rules.As per the new rules, for a 500 square metre(sq m) plot, sanction will be granted for two equivalent car spaces (ECS) per floor; 1.5 car spaces per floor will have to be provided for a plot size of 250 sq m to 500 sq m; one car space per floor would have to be provided for a plot between 100 sq m to 250 sq m and 0.5 car spaces per floor will have to be made available for a plot of 100 sq m.One equivalent car space is equal to 12.5 sq metre, which has to be indicated in car bay size in residential plots, the order said.There are between 3,000 to 4,000 plots in both licenced and HSVP sectors in the city, which are under construction. These properties got a boost after Haryana government allowed registration of fourth floor, which ensured increased demands for these properties.RS Bhath, district town planner, said that this decision will ensure that illegal construction under the stilts is stopped and that sanction for parking us sought for approval of building plan. “This is a step in the right direction and it will stop illegal activities,” he said.The real estate developers engaged in construction of small plots also welcomed the decision and said that adequate parking can now be made available for buyers of such properties. “The buyers will get parking as per the size of the plot and floors,” said Ramesh Singla, president, Gurugram Home Developers and Plot Holders Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/dtcp-makes-stilt-parking-compulsory-for-construction-of-3rd-and-4th-floors/story-cADw2JH4i6XWF1ZtcDal5O.html
01-06-2020||Gurugram||Air quality deteriorates in May as public mobility increases||Air quality in the city deteriorated in May, with an average daily reading of 143 on the air quality index (AQI), according to data from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). This was up from an average AQI value of 110 in April, and 113 in March. Experts said they expected the uptick in pollution, as the past month has seen an increase in vehicular movement during phases three and four of the ongoing nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic. The deterioration of air quality between April and May is also atypical, experts said. “Usually, with a rise in temperature as the summer progresses, air quality tends to improve in May. This year we are seeing the reverse take place. But on the whole, air quality is still better than it was during the same time last year,” Sachin Panwar, a city-based air quality scientist, said.Another indicator that points to increasing vehicular emissions as the cause for Gurugram’s deteriorating air quality is a spike in atmospheric ozone, which was recorded as a primary pollutant on 22 days in May, as per the CPCB’s daily AQI bulletin for the city. Ozone is a composite, or secondary pollutant, formed due to chemical reactions undergone by other pollutants, such as sulphur oxides and nitrogen oxides. “NOx are directly emitted by vehicles. The formation of ground-level ozone implies that primary pollutants, in this case, nitrogen oxides, are being emitted into the atmosphere,” Panwar explained. This is also reflected in data from Gurugram’s four air quality monitors. For example, on April 30, the average concentration of NOx in the city’s air was 8 parts per billion (ppb), down from 14ppb on April 1. In May, however, the concentration of NOx in city air shot up, exceeding over 100ppb on several days of the month. Further evidence of increased public mobility can be seen in data published by Google. Between April 26 and May 25 in Haryana, public movement to retail and recreational spaces increased by 24%, while visits to transit stations increased by 15%, and visits to pharmacies, food markets and grocery stores increased by 38%. Visits to workplaces also increased by 6% during the same time frame, while visits to parks and public spaces increased by 8%.Despite repeated calls and texts, Haryana State Pollution Control Board (HSPCB) officials were not available for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/air-quality-deteriorates-in-may-as-public-mobility-increases/story-mV1FAWeUVlhuQpmfymLPSO.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||78% of Shramik trains from Maharashtra sent to UP, Bihar||As many as 621 or around 78% of the total 799 special Shramik trains that departed from Maharashtra till May 30 were destined for Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Of these, 426 trains went to Uttar Pradesh (UP) and 195 departed for Bihar.Immediately after migrants living in slums at Bandra took to the streets on April 14, demanding transport to their home states, the state government wrote to the Centre for the special trains. The demand was approved in the last week of April and the first Shramik special train departed from Nashik on May 1.Since then, 799 trains have departed to 22 Indian states, transporting 11.54 lakh migrants. Around 9.13 lakh migrants are estimated to have gone back to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, and many more are still on the waiting list for Shramik trains. Most of the trains have been operating to Jaunpur and Gorakhpur districts in UP and Darbhanga in Bihar.“At least 20 lakh people are expected to have gone back to their respective states from Maharashtra over the last month. Thousands more have registered with the authorities, mostly in Mumbai Metropolitan Region. Most of them are from these two states,” said an official from the state government.Ramji Tiwari, former head of the department of Hindi at the University of Mumbai, said that most of north Indians living in Mumbai are from eastern parts of UP. “There are at least 25 lakh north Indians living in Mumbai. Most of them are from UP’s eastern districts like Gajhipur, Baliya, and Jaunpur, which are comparatively dense in population and less developed. The migrants have left Mumbai in distress after they lost their jobs and were finding it difficult to survive. It is unlikely that they will return to the city anytime soon,” he said.The Maharashtra government had made a budgetary allocation of ₹100 crore for the Shramik train services. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday said that the state has already spent around ₹90 crore on train fare.At present, 37,994 migrants workers are living at various camps set up across the state. Before Shramik trains were arranged, the number of migrants living at these camps was more than 5.70 lakh in the last week of April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/78-of-shramik-trains-from-maharashtra-sent-to-up-bihar/story-K5YmY19rUPNHxMg3GE2A2K.html

It further stated that all inter-state and intra-state movement of staff vehicles and good/cargo vehicles including empty trucks shall be allowed unhindered.“The industries, industrial establishments, commercial establishments which resume or have resumed operations shall have to ensure adherence to the lockdown measures and national directive for Covid-19 management,” the order said.Since the lockdown was imposed in the state on March 22, most industry and business establishments have been operational only partially after some lockdown norms were relaxed.In a related development, the Haryana government also gave permission to open all shops from 9am to 7pm in the state while asking them to adhere to social distancing norms.Home minister Anil Vij said that the odd-even or left-right formula will not be followed in the state anymore and instead directions will be issued to ensure social distancing norms are maintained in congested markets after assessing local conditions. The minister also said guidelines will soon be issued regarding the opening of religious places. Apart from this, home deliveries for restaurants, eateries etc. will be permitted but the delivery should be made before 9pm.During the fourth phase of the lockdown, between May 18 and May 31, the entire state was classified as an ‘orange zone’ and all economic activities were allowed with 50 percent to 75 percent staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/industrial-units-e-commerce-firms-allowed-to-operate-with-100-staff/story-CpuIqthgmlqErOxzS2XFNK.html

01-06-2020||Gurugram||Community involvement bolsters Nuh’s fight against Covid-19||Ten days ago Nuh district became coronavirus free temporarily after discharging the last five Covid-19 positive persons until a new case emerged three days later on May 26. From having the highest number of cases in Haryana in the second week of April, the district seems to have come a long way with only seven people undergoing treatment currently for the deadly disease.Nuh has recorded a total of 73 cases, out of which 66 have recovered so far, while results of 173 samples are awaited. Among the country’s most backward regions, the district was able to turn the tide, much to the surprise of people who were skeptical about its health care infrastructure and socio-economic backwardness, and is one of the few districts in the states to have active cases in single digits. In April 2018, NITI Aayog had identified Nuh, earlier known as Mewat, as the most backward district in India. In an assessment on multiple parameters such as education, health, agriculture, financial inclusion, skill development, and infrastructure, Mewat scored 26% — the lowest across the country. The district has also had a chequered history with immunisation programmes. Yet, despite various limitations at play, the district’s efforts at containing the spread have been encouraging, and no deaths have been reported so far. No new case was reported in the district for ten straight days between May 16 and May 26.Nuh’s deputy commissioner Pankaj (who goes by his first name) said the administration worked in tandem with local community leaders and village heads to contain the spread of coronavirus in the district. In April around 513 villages of the district, health department teams surveyed around 2, 35,000 households and screened over 14.5 lakh people in the district, according to the chief medical officer (CMO) of Nuh, Virender Yadav.“A large number of cases were reported in April here. During this period, anyone who came from outside was quickly traced within two days and quarantined. These included people who had some contact history with the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi. Everyone including asymptomatic individuals who have had a history with the congregation were tested. Much of this could only take place due to cooperation from local people and community leaders,” said the deputy commissioner. So far, the district has sent 5,305 samples for testing as many as 645 people found to be in contact with Covid-19 positive persons were put in self-isolation. CMO Yadav said the district recorded the maximum number of cases between April 2 and April 23 and the situation was brought under control by treating everyone with symptoms as a suspected patient. “We saw a rise in cases till April 23 and during this period, we ensured that the patient was immediately isolated and samples from the patient’s contacts collected were collected the same day,” he said.To ensure that the process of screening, testing, and isolating people with symptoms took place without any hurdles, the administration reached out to the local community, made them stakeholders in all its efforts, and took a number of confidence-building measures. Overcoming ChallengesApart from the efforts of the health and police teams, support from locals helped to propel Nuh’s fight against the disease and ward off challenges. One such challenge was to allay the apprehensions of the Muslim-concentrated region that people in quarantine could be ill-treated, a fear that became palpable with the Tablighi Jamaat congregation in Delhi hitting the headlines.The Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in Delhi had emerged as a big Covid-19 hot spot in March, after which at least 2,346 persons were evacuated, out of which many had been admitted to hospitals and more than 1,800 people were put under quarantine.“Initially, we were anticipating law and order problems when many Jamaatis were quarantined, but we tackled the reservations of people though our transparent mechanisms and active communication. We kept the Jamaatis accessible, and we informed the community leaders that they would be given escorted visits to meet the Jamaatis anytime in the quarantine centres. This worked as a confidence-building measure and helped to allay fears in the mind of the public,” said Pankaj. Additional deputy commissioner Vikram said multiple meetings were held with religious and community leaders to assuage the fears among the locals. “Initially, there was some kind of apprehensions among people. They wondered how the Jamaatis would be treated. We got all religious leaders on board and took them to quarantine facilities and the shelter houses, and assured them that the Jamaatis were being kept properly. They were satisfied and helped us in our efforts,” said Vikram.Community patrollingAt the peak of its coronavirus crisis, Nuh had around 45 containment zones, including 23 villages and two urban areas. During this period, the administration formed 289 teams that started screening people for Covid-19 symptoms. To ensure the success of the screening process, the administration reached out to village heads and imposed ‘thikri pehras’ outside the villages. Thikri pehras, a provision under section 3 of the Punjab Village and Small Town and Patrol Act, 1918, was invoked to regulate the movement of people to and from villages. “We placed thikri pehras outside the villages under which village heads (sarpanch) and other local leaders placed checkpoints at the entrances. This system ensured that outsiders couldn’t enter the villages without informing anyone. We conducted screening for anyone entering the villages from outside to ensure that infection from outside didn’t enter the village. This system was put in place around 317 panchayats. Locals maintained a vigil during the day and night,” said ADC Vikram.The involvement of village heads in halting the spread of the diseases proved useful with locals playing an active role in ensuring that their villages remained on guard. From extending help to those managing quarantine facilities to aiding the screening process, local leaders ensured that people with a travel history were quarantined and reported to the administration.Sabir Hussain, sarpanch of Malab village—where a polytechnic college was among the seven quarantine facilities in the district— said village heads and leaders played an active role in maintaining vigil, especially in the containment zones.“We kept a close watch and ensured that people coming from outside and those with symptoms were screened. Village heads shouldered a lot of responsibility and ensured that everything in quarantine facilities, from food to cleanliness, was taken care of. In our village, we took over the responsibility of delivering food at the quarantine facility after taking permission from the administration,” said Hussain.He added that many had feared that Covid-19 would rapidly spread in Nuh, but proving such expectations wrong people in the district stepped up and ensured that safety measures were followed and the situation could be brought under control. “Everyone, including the administration, perhaps thought that it would be difficult to contain the spread of coronavirus in the region, yet people proved them wrong and surprised everyone with their resilience.” Efforts by the administration and the locals have left Nuh with just one containment zone (Tauru block).CMO Yadav said the health department was able to quickly trace, test, and isolate individuals returning from Covid-19 hot spots and other states due to intervention of locals who informed the administration on time. “While we made efforts of detecting cases, the locals helped us by ensuring that anyone coming to the villages from outside was screened.” Dispelling rumoursWith the initial lockdown restrictions disrupting the reach of newspapers, the administration took support from community leaders in relaying reliable information timely and dispelling rumours. This was a much-needed step in a region that has had a tumultuous history with immunisation drives with misinformation hindering the efforts of health teams.Around March 2017, rumours that the government’s immunisation campaigns were a conspiracy to make children sterile had spread like wildlife in the region. Doctored videos circulating on social media had further heightened the fears among the local population.. To avoid a repeat of the episode, the district administration reached out to community leaders for effective outreach among the local population.“Religious leaders in Nuh cooperated with us a lot. We organised three or four meetings with them initially. The leaders would make announcements from mosques and madrassas emphasising that people should offer prayers at home and support the health team in all their efforts,” said deputy commissioner Pankaj. He recalled that some people were reluctant about sharing samples during the holy month of Ramzan, but they were pacified after the much helpful intervention of religious leaders.“Some people were not willing to let health teams collect their samples during Ramzan, but religious leaders stepped in and clarified through videos that giving samples wouldn’t affect their fasting in any way,” said Pankaj.Mufti Zahid Hussain of Nuh’s Bada madarssa said he has been in constant touch with the administration ever since coronavirus cases started emerging in the region. “ It was a mutually beneficial relationship for both sides. People followed the lockdown rules and stayed inside. We made sure that people cooperated with the health teams. People abided by the lockdown rules and offered prayers, including the Eid and Jummah prayers at home,” he said.Along with making announcements over loudspeakers in mosques, social media and community radio stations were also used to quell misinformation and spread awareness on physical distancing. Community radio stations such as Radio Mewat and Alfaz-e-Mewat aired special programs on Covid-19 providing reliable information and serving as a bridge between the government and locals.Siddique Ahmed Meo, social activist and community historian, said the administration’s approach of working with the locals had strengthened its fight against the pandemic. “Village heads were asked to inform the authorities about outsiders who had their concealed travel history from the administration. Village heads communicated with these individuals and convinced them to get in touch with the administration. At some places, people themselves reached out to the government, and in other instances, the administration came to take them to quarantine facilities. The mutual arrangement worked for the district,” said Meo.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/community-involvement-bolsters-nuh-s-fight-against-covid-19/story-gYe0E36s31Nm5Rjxy0YhJO.html
01-06-2020||Chandigarh||Biggest spike in Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh during lockdown 4.0||Chandigarh: The steepest rise in Covid-19 cases in the city was registered during Lockdown 4.0 as compared to other phases beginning from March 24 this year to prevent the transmission of Covid-19, calculations made from data shared by health authorities reveal.The cases spiked when restrictions were eased considerably during lockdown 4.0, with public transport and public dealing in government offices resuming, markets opening and restaurants allowed to home deliver of food after nearly two months.Only 95 cases were reported in the city during the first two lockdowns – 21 in the first and 74 in the second – when strict restrictions were in place, and 96 recorded in the third phase lasting for 14 days from May 4 to May 17. The next phase, from May 18 to May 31, recorded 103 positive cases, or 34% of the total cases.Biggest single day spikeThe biggest single day spike of 29 cases also came on May 24, a week after the restrictions were eased. Three areas , EWS Colony in Sector 38 and parts of Sector 52 and Shastri Nagar in Manimajra, however, were denotified as containment zones in this phase.One interesting aspect of the last lockdown, however, was that cases were all localised in the Bapu dham containment zone in Sector 26 with only four of 103 cases reported from other localities of Dhanas, Sector 30, Dadu majra and Khuda Ali Sher.Now only three containment zones remain, including Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26, Kacchi Colony in Dhanas, and parts of Sector 30B.Another interesting point to note was the surge in recovery rates after the fourth lockdown. From May 18 to May 31, there were 145 recoveries out of a total of 199 owing to changes in discharge policy of patients when asymptomatic and mild cases were discharged from Covid-19 designated centres without testing. Earlier, only those with two results testing negative consecutively within 24 hours were allowed to go home.Peak yet to comeHowever, according to Dr Jagat Ram, Director, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PRIMER), seeing the trend of the cases, a peak in the number of cases is yet to come.“The peak may come anywhere between June and July, but that does not mean that everything should be shut. The virus is here to stay and to we need to modify our lifestyle to stay safe,” he said.Completely unlocking the city will require a fine balancing act between humanitarian and health concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cases-spiked-34-in-chandigarh-during-lockdown-4-0/story-oICfg8C34Vq8hVM7txYexM.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||Traffic snarls begin again on all major highways, police expect further surge from June 3||An increase in movement of private vehicular traffic was witnessed on city roads on Monday morning as the state government announced some relaxations while extending the lockdown in the state till June 30.Slow-moving traffic was reported in certain patches on both, the western express highway (WEH) and eastern express highway (EEH). Traffic slowed down outside vegetable markets on the Sion-Panvel road and other areas in the suburbs. This came after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday night announced Mission Begin Again – the fifth phase of the lockdown.From June 5, all markets, shopping areas, and stores, except malls and market complexes, will be allowed to function on an odd-even basis from 9am to 5pm, the Maharashtra government guidelines indicated. Standalone shops in one lane will be allowed to open on odd dates while those in the next lane can function on even dates. The government notification, however, warns that failure to maintain social distancing norms by shops and markets will result in the immediate closure of such commercial establishments.This is also seen as one of the reasons for traffic as shopkeepers have started to venture out for stocks. “The nakabandi is underway. We anticipate that traffic will further increase from June 3,” said additional commissioner of police (traffic) Pravin Padwal.Starting June 3, the state has also lifted restrictions on outdoor physical activities like cycling, running, and jogging. Use of beaches, parks, playgrounds, gardens, and promenades will be allowed from 5am to 7pm.Lack of public transport and the need to maintain social distance has resulted in citizens taking their vehicles on the roads. “We are allowing essential services which also include goods carriers, tempos, and trucks. Local trains are non-operational while BEST buses are running at half capacity. Hence, we expect that the use of private vehicles may increase,” said Padwal. People took to Twitter on Monday to report the increase in traffic. “Unlock 1 started bit early for Mumbai. Mumbai highway started seeing traffic again,” wrote one user. Others raised concerns that this may lead to a rise in infection while some said that doctors, nurses, and those working for essential services may get affected due to the traffic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/traffic-snarls-begin-again-on-all-major-highways-police-expect-further-surge-from-june-3/story-qjjBSJay9H6ESyRvQyjCoL.html

01-06-2020||Delhi||IIT-D offers ‘early graduation’ option to final-year students||The Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi (IIT-D) on Monday announced it would provide an “early graduation” option to its final-year students to avoid any delay in their future plans due to the Covid-19 pandemic.According to IIT-D director V Ramgopal Rao, the senate—the highest decision-making body of the institute—approved the policy. “According to the current plan, we hope to get students back on the campus in a phased manner from July 2. However, these dates can change depending on how the Covid-19 situation develops (they may be delayed). Since there may be some delay, a time-bound Early Graduation Plan is being offered. We will not force students to take it, but will give them the flexibility to exercise this option,” Rao said.Under the early graduation option, which will allow students to graduate by the end of June, they can either choose an “audit” or a “credit” option. In the credit option, the students will take online tests, home exams, assignments and telephonic viva-voce, among other options, Rao said.The audit option will allow students to choose to be evaluated based on their previous exams. “The course instructors will inform the students about their grades based on their previous performances. In case they are not satisfied with that, they can appear for online tests or home exams under the credit option,” he said.“All early graduation requirements will be met through an online process. No student will need to come to the campus. The only reason the graduating batch will need to come to the campus will be to pick up their belongings,” the director added.“Besides, students can also choose the regular graduation process as and when they are allowed back on the campus,” he said.The students will be asked to pick an option through an online portal in the next few days. “In case a student cannot complete their graduation requirements by the end of June via these options, they will have a fallback option to graduate when the semester reconvenes. The pass/fail percentages this year will be no different from previous years. It will be our responsibility to ensure that no one is disadvantaged because of the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic,” Rao said.Meanwhile, students said that the administration should fix a uniform criteria for the audit option for all courses. “Audit criteria for many courses like Maths are unmanageable. They go as high as 80 marks and students need to be given relaxation, in lieu of the reduced quality of online education. We hope the administration can fix the audit criteria for all courses, instead of providing guidelines, so as to smoothen out the heterogeneity in these difficult times. This would significantly lower the misery for many students [sic],” a statement by the IIT-D board of students read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/iit-d-offers-early-graduation-option-to-final-year-students/story-gYqwfpLc1AzV2yx9U1w6nJ.html

01-06-2020||Mumbai||Two IIT-B startups design temperature sensors to detect Covid suspects in a crowd||Two startups incubated at the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, have designed temperature-sensing devices that work on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning. These devices can scan a large group of people at a time for body temperatures to aid government agencies in detecting Covid-19 patients and carriers as the lockdown measures ease across the country.Faclon Labs, which works on providing technology solutions for reducing operating costs of companies, is currently working with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to set up automatic plug-and-go screening devices that can be mounted on a wall or tripod. These devices capture thermal snapshots of individuals and activate alarms upon detecting those with fever.“The camera is a plug and play setup that uses artificial intelligence to localise and detect a person in its field of view and analyses it to get the thermal data to identify the body temperature. Once the temperature is higher than the threshold, relevant people are alerted to take necessary actions,” said Parth Chaudhary, heading the business development division of Faclon. The startup is in the process of applying for a patent, he added.Augle AI, another startup, has designed a temperature sensing system that can skim through hundreds of people moving in public places. Tejendu Mouli, the head of their technology team, said, “We are integrating this (device) with our existing facial recognition system to strengthen the safety and security in offices, government buildings, public places, malls – any place where people gather in large numbers.” The team said that the facial recognition module can help identify those with high body temperatures and aid healthcare agencies to identify carriers of the infection. They also provide drone-based crowd analytics for quarantined areas for increasing the safety of police officials and health workers.Both startups were mentored by the Desai Sethi Centre School of Entrepreneurship.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/two-iit-b-startups-design-temperature-sensors-to-detect-covid-suspects-in-a-crowd/story-tTlTYs5bV3nYl75K5OUEJN.html

Hooda said the government will have to withdraw curbs on paddy cultivation following a campaign by the opposition. “Instead of imposing restrictions on farmers and panchayats, the government should resume projects like Dadupur-Nalvi; digging of Rakshi River, Saraswati River, Khand Nala, Ottu Lake, Bibipur Lake, Kotla Lake, ponds, drains and canals,” he added.He also demanded that the government should clear farmers’ pending payments of wheat and sugarcane immediately and should compensate them soon for losses suffered due to hailstorms and unseasonal rains.Expressing his concern over the alleged liquor scam, Hooda said that the intention of the government was not clear. “Far from an impartial probe into the scam, the government has not yet been able to decide which agency should investigate it,” he said.In reference to the scam, he said that the government doesn’t even listen to its own minister (home) Anil Vij.“Vij is my old friend but I wish to ask him why does he bother to speak even though his own government does not listen to him,” he said, adding that a new scam was unfolding even before the investigation could begin on this one.He alleged that the contractors were selling liquor at an arbitrary rate.Hooda also expressed concern over the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the state and demanded that the government should pay attention to complaints regarding corona patients not being looked after properly. “At this time, the health of people is more important than politics,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hooda-accuses-bjp-jjp-govt-of-framing-anti-farmer-policies/story-yRKqeNXbeosQ2vV5GYhlFL.html

01-06-2020||Delhi||List steps taken to protect sanitation workers from Covid-19, HC tells Delhi govt, civic bodies||The Delhi High Court on Monday sought to know from the Delhi government and the three municipal corporations — north, south and east — about steps they have been taken for the safety of the safai karamcharis (sanitation workers) from Covid-19. The court also asked them to file detailed affidavits about the status of dumping of bio-medical waste at common dumping grounds, which they feared can aid the spread of Covid-19 among manual scavengers. A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that dumping of bio medical waste at common dumping ground is a “critical area” and matter of concern as scavengers would be first to be exposed to the infection.“This is a critical area, considering the submission made by counsel for the petitioners that bio-medical waste is being dumped in common dumping grounds, which can itself be a breeding ground of Covid-19 infection if any person unknowingly comes in contact with an infected PPE kit or gloves or masks. This is particularly a matter of concern as manual scavengers will be the first ones to be exposed to the infection,” the court said.The court’s remarks came while hearing a bunch of pleas seeking PPE kits and other medical equipment for sanitation workers.On Monday, the court noted that the affidavit and status reports filed by the Delhi government and the three municipal corporations were incomplete. It asked the authorities to give details of the number of sanitation workers in their jurisdictions and the number of PPE kits provided to them on a day-to-day basis during the Covid-19 pandemic.It gave the Delhi government and the three municipal corporations a week’s time to file fresh affidavits highlighting the points raised by the bench while also detailing “whether sanitizing cubicles have been installed by the civic authorities in each ward and if not, what steps have been taken to ensure that after the safai karamcharis complete their duty for the day, they are adequately disinfected”.Advocate Mehmood Pracha, appearing for one of the petitioners Harnam Singh, told the court that while the authorities claim to have distributed the PPE kits, the workers on the ground do not appear to have received them.The Delhi government in the affidavit, filed through its additional standing counsel Gautam Narayan, said that a PPE kit comprises of coveralls, masks, gloves and goggles and it has been receiving these components separately from HLL Lifecare Ltd, a government of India enterprise.It has also said that using different components, it has made 2.77 lakh PPE kits till May 22 out of which 2.75 lakh kits have been issued to chief district medical officers, Delhi government hospitals and health institutions, municipal hospitals and zonal offices of different municipalities where sanitation workers are employed.The matter would be now heard on June 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/list-steps-taken-to-protect-sanitation-workers-from-covid-19-hc-tells-delhi-govt-civic-bodies/story-mlhZJCEzjI3zLLNTZnDTSO.html

Rules to mark and fell trees were also violated by opening up the close canopy of the forest. Labour records of workers entering and exiting forest areas were also not kept and trees were felled after sunset, which was prohibited, the official said. Apportioning of common land shares to owners of the common land was also not done, he added.Katha used in paan (betel leaf) and cutch, used as a food additive, in astringent, tannin, dye and medicines are produced from Khair or Acacia catechu. The wood is much prized for posts in house construction and used for making oil and sugarcane crushers, oil and sugar crushers and parts of boats. The raids will continue for the second day on Tuesday.“This is private forest land, the government has nothing to do with this. What the teams are checking are illegal felling of trees as permits were given for the same. We have marked all Khair trees,” said Guraman Singh, district forest officer, Mohali.The forest department gives permission to fell trees after every five years as per silviculture practices. Though guidelines state that felling had to be completed by March 15 and logged wood moved to stores by March 31, reports had been received of felling continuing till mid-April amid the lockdown when strict rules allowing only essential services were in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vigilance-raid-in-kharar-areas-to-check-illegal-felling-of-khair-trees/story-UyUju31QCpbbJlzf8NtfpN.html

As Malik had some work, he asked his brother-in-law Shivam to go ahead. When he reached there, he saw accused Pardeep, Deeapk Kumar, Sandeep Kumar, Rahul Kumar, Vikas and Ankit assaulting Shivam. After he intervened, the accused attacked him as well. Injured Mandeep and Shivam were admitted to Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32.In the second case, Pradeep, 26, who works as a safai karmachari, accused Mandeep of threatening and attacking him and his family. Pradeep told the police that the woman he had divorced in 2015 had remarried Mandeep, which is why the latter nursed a grudge against him.Two separate cases were registered under sections 147 (rioting), 149 (unlawful assembly), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/7-arrested-after-two-groups-clash-over-parking-in-chandigarh-s-sector-49/story-5jgkjWKVp4H145ND0oKMnK.html

We are also at the receiving end as we have to pay monthly rent, property tax and GST, etc while gyms are closed.”Director of the association Ramesh Bangar said, “The fitness sector across the state has been hit hard due to lockdown, but the government has failed to pay heed to the problem. Athletes, trainers, administrative and maintenance staff, gymnasium owners, supplement and other wellness and equipment manufacturers have been affected, as gymnasiums are closed for over two months. If lockdown continued for gymnasiums, it would also result in unemployment. Athletes generally work as trainers in gyms and their salary is the basic source of their income. Gymnasium owners are also burdened with electricity bills, rent of premises, etc for the lockdown period.”Talwar said gymnasiums have been closed for the safety of visitors. But, he would take up the matter with the government so that some relief could be provided to the sector, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gym-owners-in-ludhiana-hold-protest-hand-over-memorandum-to-mla-talwar/story-zKrdI5niaZ76JEMXlgyYZK.html

They did not have e-pass and had no instructions to allow people to travel so we sent most of them home.”More than 50 commuters were sent back from the Vashi toll and more than 30 people from the Kharghar toll.“After questioning them, we found that many were going to their native village in Konkan. We had to explain to them the reason they cannot be allowed to leave city,” said Khatavar.Many started arguing with the traffic policemen.“We thought that now there is no need of e-pass hence, we stepped out but we were stopped by the traffic cops,” said Ankur Jaiswal, 40, a Kharghar resident.Navi Mumbai police commissioner Sanjay Kumar said, “We started getting a lot of queries about inter-district and interstate mobility. The state guideline issued on May 30 said interstate and inter-district movement of people shall continue to be regulated. This means one still requires a pass and a genuine reason to travel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/motorists-going-out-of-town-stopped-at-vashi-toll-booth/story-VbZpCtop6CoIlQ1dEE35HN.html
01-06-2020||Chandigarh||Art and culture make a quick beeline to the digital||SHOW MUST GO ON Seeing the pandemic as a hiccup in history, cultural groups have gone digital with great enthusiasm lest the chain be broken and the audience lostWith lockdowns, social distancing and closure of cultural functions; art and culture academies, literature festival groups as well as individual artists have lost no time in seeking visibility in the visual world through dialogues, discussions and performances online.While it was Namita Gokhale, co-director of the Jaipur Literature Festival (JLF), who started with the Saturday series of international participants titled ‘The Brave New World’ after Aldous Huxley’s dystopian novel on the end of human spontaneity and freedom. However, cultural and literary groups in the region were quick to meet the challenge of lost space of the real world.Love’s labourAfter two years of intense world involving two literary festivals a year for adults and one for children, Preeti Gill of Majha House was all set to hold the Basant Festival 2020 on March 21 and 22, put together with care and some of the best talent of the country participating. But it was not to be as Covid-19 had struck home. “It was love’s labour lost,” says Preeti, “and instead of all the effort coming to not, we decided to take what we could digitally and thus offering a series on culture to our eager audience!” Interestingly, in this period Majha House has made a special effort to build cultural ties across borders by starting the initiative ‘Sanjha Punjab’, a group to foster common cultural ties between the two Punjabs. After an initial dialogue with artists and writers from Pakistan, more digital meets on issues of interest are being organized, including the saga of ‘Heer’ by Waris Shah.Tricity initiativesA number of initiatives are coming up in the tricity and an interesting three-part online exhibition by the Chandigarh Lalit Kala Akademi involving a large number of senior and young artists of the city and their lockdown art. Akademi chairperson Bheem Malhotra says, “Our Open Hand Sudios and galleries were deserted and the tempo of the activity that we had built came to a standstill. It was a sad season but we decided to come out online because our artists were at work painting their responses to the pandemic”. The artists sent pictures of their works as well as the process of creation and these were mounted online, covering 90 senior, middle and upcoming artists.Social media offers artists, musicians and writers to post their works online and the city artists have responded well to the challenge of ‘5 paintings in 5 days’ on the Facebook, bringing works from some of the best city artists including the reticent master painter Raj Kumar. A remarkable feat in this line is by city photographer Vijay Ozo who has won as many as 43 awards in international photography in minimal depiction of the Lockdown. The show indeed goes on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/art-and-culture-make-a-quick-beeline-to-the-digital/story-z8Qp7r2siqimNdqWqbGCBL.html
01-06-2020||Chandigarh||Students moved from GNPS Birmi to another branch, parents allege they were not informed||About 400 students of Guru Nanak Public School (GNPS), Birmi, have been moved to the Model Town Extension branch without parents being informed or consulted, it has been alleged.More than a 100 parents gathered at 9 am to protest against the move outside the school at Model Town Extension on Monday, alleging that no prior notice had been issued to them and that they were informed about the move when they went to deposit the school fee. The parents continued protesting even as the principal, Mona Singh, invited five representatives from among them for a talk. They consented to come inside and speak to her later only after the police were called in at 1 pm. Mona Singh reportedly assured them that the Birmi school would not be closed.“The school authorities should have informed the parents in March about their decision to close down the Birmi Branch as no institute affiliated to the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will admit our children should we decide to transfer them anywhere,” said Dapinder Singh, a parent of two children in Class 3 and 8.A resident of Ayali Kalan, Dapinder Singh said the Model Town Extension branch was located far from their residence and it would be very difficult to pick up and drop the children.Ramandeep Kaur, the sarpanch of Purain, a village close by, said, “15 children from our children were studying in GNPS Birmi for quite some time and no intimation was given to their parents to move them.”Adding that it was up to parents to decide where their children studied and not school authorities, Kaur added: “We admitted our children at the Birmi branch because the school was close to our village. It was affiliated to CBSE and the Model Town Extension branch to the Indian School Certificate Examination, so how can the students study there? Textbooks for the next session on the CBSE pattern have also been bought.” Later, Mona Singh, said, “We have not informed the parents regarding closure of the Birmi branch and it is only a rumour. Out of 100 protestors, only 20% were parents and others were outsiders trying to defame the school. I have decided to lodge a complaint against these protestors with the police commissioner for targeting our school and unnecessarily holding a protest outside the school. I asked the parents to maintain social distancing in the wake of Covid-19, but nobody listened to us.”The principal also added that the parents had been informed that they could pay the tuition fee in cash or through card at the Model Town Extension branch. “Online payment option is also available,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/students-moved-from-gnps-birmi-to-another-branch-parents-allege-they-were-not-informed/story-ESCyDFXHjJdPdmPlJofkPK.html

Acting on the same, the PSERC had, in May, sought objections and suggestions from residents over the same till May 19. We submitted a suggestion on fixed charges, following which a public hearing was held on Monday.”“We have told the regulatory commission that if the fixed charges are not waived, it would not only affect the industry, but also have a negative impact on the PSPCL, as industry is going through a tough phase. If the industry would not consume power, the PSPCL would also run into losses,” said Thukral.FICO president Gurmeet Singh Kular said, “Apart from the demand of waiving fixed charges for a year, the FICO also demanded that night tariff should be introduced for the industry at Rs 2.50 per unit. Also, the cross-subsidy clause, which forces the industry to pay Rs 3.50 per unit to the PSPCL, if they buy power from an open source should be removed.”Members of the Ludhiana Induction Furnace Association and the Chamber of Industrial and Commercial Undertaking (CICU) also attended the hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pserc-public-hearing-ludhiana-industry-demands-waiver-of-fixed-charges-in-power-bills-for-one-year/story-PyiQ71z5frTyHA2kJ6ZlDI.html

Conductors will avoid physical contact with the passengers while issuing the ticket. Drivers and conductors have also been provided protective gears like face shields and gloves,” he said.Even as bus services resumed across the state, people preferred to stay home and only a few undertook the journey on the first day due to fear of Covid-19. Many buses in Shimla were seen plying almost empty or with minimal occupancy.In other districts too, very few people were seen travelling in buses. The inter-state bus terminals at Dharamshala and Shimla also wore a deserted look as few passengers turned up.The Himachal Pradesh government has allowed inter-district and intra-district public transport without e-passes. Taxis, maxi cabs and auto-rickshaws can also ferry passengers from one district to the other. The number of passengers allowed on board depends on the capacity of the vehicle. In small taxis, three passengers are allowed excluding the driver and in cabs it may vary from four to seven. Wearing masks in the vehicle is mandatory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/public-transport-back-on-road-in-himachal-but-with-low-passenger-turnout/story-vqiP5isafSds9V1HaBpIuM.html

01-06-2020||Chandigarh||With CM nod to Covid cess on liquor, Punjab to mop up ₹145 crore revenue||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday approved the imposition of Covid cess on liquor with effect from June 1.The move will help the state mop up additional revenue of ₹145 crore in the current financial year.The state is facing a revenue shortfall of ₹26,000 crore, which is 30% of the total budget revenue estimates, for financial year 2020-21, necessitating some tough measures to generate additional revenue, the CM said, accepting the recommendation of the group of ministers (GoM), which was constituted on May 12 to examine the matter, to levy additional excise duty and additional assessed fee on liquor during the current financial year.The revenue generated from the additional levy shall be utilised entirely for Covid-related expenditure, the CM said, directing the department of excise and taxation to charge the cess in the current year, at the time of issuance of permits for transportation of liquor from L-1 and L-13 (wholesale licences).Amarinder had earlier asked GoM, comprising the finance, education and housing and urban development ministers, to examine the proposal on levying special Covid cess on the sale of liquor, to partially recoup some of the revenue losses amid this unprecedented crisis.In line with GoM’s recommendations, the excise department has decided to impose additional assessed fee on imported foreign liquor and imported beer, and additional excise duty on other types of liquor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-cm-nod-to-covid-cess-on-liquor-punjab-to-mop-up-145-crore-revenue/story-HqMez7xMhrgQh2hy1SmokJ.html

The woman suffered more than 80% burns and has been admitted to ESIC Hospital, where her condition is stated to be critical.According to the police, the woman has strained relations with her husband and mother-in-law. She alleged that they used to physically and mentally harass her over petty issues. Besides, they were unhappy with the fact that she used to work as a domestic help to earn a living. Things got worse when she gave birth to a girl child. On Sunday evening, when she returned from work, her husband started arguing with her for returning late. When he stepped out of the house, the woman locked herself in their one-room accommodation and set herself ablaze after sprinkling kerosene upon herself.Her mother-in-law had gone out with their two children--three-year-old-son and nine-month-old daughter-- at the time. On hearing the 24-year-old woman’s screams, neighbours informed her husband, who then climbed up the roof, made of tin, and rescued her.Based on the woman’s complaint, police have lodged a case against her husband, a scrap dealer, and her mother-in-law. The case has been lodged under Sections 306 (abetment to suicide) and 511 (attempt to commit an offence) of the Indian Penal Code.

01-06-2020||City||Cherry sales plunge in Kashmir, growers demand minimum support price amid Covid-19 crisis||With low demand and deficient transport facilities crippling their business, cherry growers in Kashmir have appealed to the Jammu and Kashmir administration for a minimum support price.Kashmir Fruit Growers cum Dealers Union(KFGDU) has assailed the administration for its ‘failure’ in providing adequate transport facilities during the lockdown as well as disregarding their request to provide minimum support price for the fruit.“The union has also requested Lt Governor’s administration for consideration of minimum support prices of cherry at ₹100/kg so that the cherry growers of the valley who have constantly suffered heavy losses since 2014 floods may heave a sigh of relief. However, the administration did not pay any attention to the said proposal,” said Bashir Ahmad Basheer, chairman KFGDU, in a statement.The cherry production in the valley is estimated to be 12,000 metric tonnes. Last year, the figure was around 11,700 metric tonnes.Kashmir exports some 3,500 to 4000 metric tonnes of cherries to other states every year.Despite the sizeable yield, farmers are a worried lot because of the lack of demand following the closure of markets and poor transportation facilities from farms to markets amid Covid-19 restrictions. They are getting a price of ₹45-50 per kg as against double the amount last year.Basheer said that owing to the apprehension of the total damage of cherry crop this year, the cherry growers of the valley are staring at losses of crores of rupees with around 10 lakh families directly or indirectly connected with this industry.Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole said that there was no past precedent for such demand or its fulfillment. “Is there an example that such a thing has happened in the past which we could emulate,” he said.“Given the circumstances, the supply chain of every commodity is disrupted. Nevertheless, we are facilitating them,” he added.Kashmir produces four types of cherries – Awwal Number, Double, Mishri and Makhmali.Pole said that the admin was facilitating the transportation of the fruit to Delhi while Mumbai was a red zone. “Every day 5-7 trucks are going to major markets of Delhi. Although 70% of the supply of cherry goes to Mumbai the city is closed down,” he said.The union said that the Canning Owners Association, which lifts the double cherry variety, is reluctant in view of the closure of canning factories and uncertainty of its marketing.Pole said that they have given a nod to 20 canning units to start functioning. “The units will be opening and some 4000 metric tons will be used for canning,” Pole said.Cherries are grown on an estimated 2,713 hectares in Kashmir and over the years, the production has increased. From 8,282 metric tonnes during 2016-17, the figure increased to 11,280 metric tonnes in 2017-18 and further to 11,789 metric tonnes in 2018-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cherry-sales-plunge-in-kashmir-growers-demand-minimum-support-price-amid-covid-19-crisis/story-4KrNmtaHvEYFlHQYDQmmaP.html

City markets remained largely deserted with many shopkeepers closing their establishments by late afternoon as fewer customers were seen in the markets.Ganga Saptami is considered as an auspicious day when sacred Ganga descended from matted locks of Lord Shiva and descended from Gaumukh, Gangotri till Ganga Sagar, after severe penance and meditation by King Bhagirath.While district administration didn’t allow people to take a holy dip in Ganga at sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund Ganga ghat at Har-Ki-Pauri - where entry was prohibited, other Ganga ghats like Birla, Alaknanda, Kushawrat, Rishikul, Maharishi Kashyap, Swami Vivekanand, Gobind, Maharaja Agrasen, Prem Nagar ghat among others were visited by locals who took a dip in Ganga and performed Ganga Saptami related rituals.Ganga Sabha, the managing religious body of Har-Ki-Pauri, performed special Ganga rituals while following social distance norms in the wake of coronavirus pandemic.City markets of Upper Road, Moti Bazar, Shiv Moorti, Chandracharya square remained deserted despite easing of lockdown restrictions.“We had high hopes that on the occasion of Ganga Saptami and the first day of Unlock 1.0 there would be movement of people and local pilgrims in the markets but all our hopes were shattered. Many traders couldn’t even sell items in the first few hours as coronavirus impact has highly affected the trading. Now, we hope after June 8, when religious places of worship, restaurants, shopping complexes open up there may be some improvement in trading,” said Rajat Ohri, of General Store owner at Moti Bazaar.While City Trader Division, Jwalapur president Vipin Gupta said that markets in suburban Jwalapur has not witnessed major change as far rush is concerned, with fewer non-essential buyers arriving at markets. We are adhering to safety and precautionary guidelines but as far as trade and market buzz is concerned its missing, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ganga-saptami-in-haridwar-witnesses-thin-crowd-few-locals-visit-ghats/story-JVrThiyqIutiUM1IAmCozM.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||HC rebuffs attempt to stall sale of prime Cuffe Parade bungalow||The Bombay high court (HC) has rebuffed an attempt to stall sale of a prime bungalow, spread over around 25,000 square feet, at Cuffe Parade for recovery of dues of a financial institution. A bench of justice Nitin Jamdar and justice NR Borkar on Friday refused to grant any interim relief to the owner of the bungalow.Apart from challenging the notice issued on April 15 for sale of the property, the owner had also challenged validity of a notification issued by Union finance ministry on November 9, 2016 dispensing the requirement of consent of the borrower for the sale of the asset by private treaty. It was argued on the owner’s behalf that by taking advantage of the nationwide lockdown, the property was grossly undervalued and was being secretly sold by private treaty.The petitioner’s counsel pointed out that for auction sale the property was valued at ₹158 crore in August 2018, but now the valuation has been brought down to ₹75 crore. Citing that the alleged default occurred in March 2019, but the financer waited for almost a year, the counsel said no prejudice will be caused if the sale was stayed till the lockdown if lifted. He submitted that if a public auction is held after lifting of the lockdown, a better price can be fetched for the property which will benefit the financial institution as well.The financial institution opposed the plea contending that artificial cause of action was created to invoke jurisdiction of the high court just to avoid payment of 25℅ of the amount required to file an appeal with the Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal.The court was further informed that a notice dated February 17, 2020 had fixed the reserve price for the property at ₹82 crore, which has been brought down to ₹75 crore after imposition of lockdown.The bench found substance in the contentions of the financial institution that the value of the property was successively brought down after no response was received to auction notices and that no advantage was taken of the lockdown to bring down the reserve price for the property.“There is merit in the contention that the petitioner’s sole attempt is to somehow stop the sale of the property, as the petitioner has not tried to bring any buyer or to make a statement before the Debt Recovery Tribunal or to this court that the petitioner will deposit a certain amount or will bring a buyer. The Debt Recovery Tribunal has rightly noted this conduct of the petitioner,” said the bench. “In this factual position, we do not find that the attempt to sell the property by private treaty is malafide,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-rebuffs-attempt-to-stall-sale-of-prime-cuffe-parade-bungalow/story-RrUt4dLdskQmKIIecjS6GO.html

01-06-2020||Kolkata||People throng streets in large numbers, traffic snarl in Kolkata||People came out on the streets of Kolkata in large numbers with total disregard to social-distancing norms, while traffic snarl was noticed in many places as the lockdown relaxations come into effect in West Bengal on Monday. Many shops across the city that remained closed during the lockdown also reopened during the day. Religious places like the Thantania Kali temple and Lake Kali Bari also reopened, but the Kalighat temple remained closed. “A decision on reopening will be taken by the shrine committee,” sources said. People either availed of the skeletal public transport or travelled to their workplaces in two-wheelers and cars. Traffic snarls were noticed on Jessore Road near airport, Esplanade, Howrah Bridge and VIP Road, with people standing in queues waiting for buses and auto. Huge traffic was also noticed on BT Road. Some buses are plying in few routes of the city, and in districts like Howrah and Hooghly. State buses plied in 40 city routes and some inter-district routes. Ferry services across the Hooghly river also resumed at one-hour intervals. The state government had on Saturday extended the lockdown till June 15, but allowed total attendance in micro, small, medium and large industries, including mining activities, from June 1. The government also allowed construction activities with 100 per cent of the strength of workers from Monday. It has also given nod to indoor and outdoor activities related to TV and cinema production, barring reality show production, from June 1. As the West Bengal government has allowed 100 per cent deployment of workforce in the jute industry from Monday, there was nearly 60 per cent attendance in the first shift. Sources said it would fall to 50 per cent in the second shift and further to 30 to 40 per cent in the night shift. This is due to a huge chunk of the labourers having gone back to their native places like Bihar, Jharkhand and Odisha due to the lockdown, according to sources. While the state government also allowed 100 per cent deployment of workforce in the tea gardens, it was much higher on Monday than the previous days, sources said. The Home Ministry had said on Saturday ‘Unlock-1’ would be initiated across the country from June 8, in which the nationwide lockdown from March 25 would be relaxed to a great extent, including opening of shopping malls, restaurants and religious places, even as strict restrictions would remain in places till June 30 in the containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/people-throng-streets-in-large-numbers-traffic-snarl-in-kolkata/story-BtdzCFH1MqY02PJR6SqW1H.html
01-06-2020||Lucknow||Pedalling for pleasure & fitness: Cyclists hit the road once again||Before Lockdown 1.0, “No helmet, no ride!” was the standard warning to members in all cycling groups in the city . In simple words, it meant a rider sans a helmet would be turned back.But since Lockdown 4.0 began, there is an added warning: “No mask, no ride!”. In the interim period cycling groups suspended all organised rides but now they have hit the roads again.“Yes, we are back”, said Dr Imran Khan, 38, a medical professional and an avid bicyclist, who rode along with Kushagra Kapoor, a businessman, Yashesh Vyas, an architect and Shad Zaman, a marketing professional with a telecom giant.Khan said: “Covid-19 had confined cyclists too indoors and we survived by various fitness regimens. But they all pale against riding outdoors in a natural environment”.Shad Zaman, 41, says: “We rode maintaining social distance and following safety protocols.”Shad maintained a gruelling indoor fitness regimen with weight training, yoga, breathing exercises, burpees, indoor running and whatnot. But he swears by outdoor cycling. He took to cycling 4 years ago when at 37 most of his medical parameters--from knee condition to lipid profile--all rang alarm bells.“Now, I am fit as a fiddle,” says Shad. In work from home (WFH) mode, Shad says he will resume his four days a week cycling routine now with 200 km per week.Vandana Mishra, 41, while talking about the resumption of her daily cycling routine, brings in ‘mind’. An entrepreneur, homemaker, mother of two adolescents, a cyclist, biker, runner, and pursuing a PhD in psychology, Vandana says: “Pedalling during the lockdown was the safest bet for maintaining sanity. The daily cycling routine brought in the much-needed catharsis.”“Covid-19 has brought in tremendous stress and anxiety for all age groups. And what better way can there be than to pedal away worries, exploring new trails each day,” she says.While all these riders are members of multiple cycling groups in the city, not all groups have resumed organised group rides. So, most cyclists these days are either riding solo or in small sub-groups. The Cyclopedia group’s manager Vishal Sharma says: “We ride in small groups and follow Covid-19 safety protocols. Earlier, we all held refreshment parties mid-way or at the end of the rides, but not anymore.”5 AM, PLEASE:Major Gaurav Mathur (retired), 72, who founded Pedal Pushers cycling group, says: “We are not resuming yet. We find lifting of curfew at 7 am a bit skewed. Let shops and establishments stay closed till 7 am or 8 am, but morning walkers, runners, cyclists should be allowed. At 4 am, curfew should end for people like us. I suppose the government wants people to strengthen their immunity. All experts say that strong immunity is a shield against Covid-19. Exercising in the morning improves health and immunity. If people continue to stay indoors, then even healthy ones would end up with weakened immunity. The summer heat has risen. We will not resume until the curfew ends entirely or at least end each day by 5 am.” A daily rider, Major Mathur, did not ride even a day since February 23.Dr Imran Khan, medical professional and a rider supports Major Mathur on immunity idea but emphasises pedalling. He says: “Ourdoor cycling is a moderate impact exercise and has great cardio benefits. It improves breathing, circulation, and immunity, which helps in fighting Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/pedalling-for-pleasure-fitness-cyclists-hit-the-road-once-again/story-3esoBaG3wYPyYEYLZiEUpO.html
01-06-2020||Pune||Monday Musings: Coping with Covid-19 as we fast-forward into the future||What started as a lockdown for three weeks on March 25, went into four extensions, changing our world like never before. We will soon enter Unlock 1.0 from June 8 even as the pandemic needs to be brought under control in Pune and Mumbai. As of today, the collateral damage from Covid-19 has been colossal and the after-shocks will be felt month after month. Businesses across sectors have been hit hard with the worst-affected being the hotel, tourism and the hospitality industry. Schools are yet to re-open and while school and college education is rapidly moving to the digital platform, the poor will continue to suffer with no access to either computer or internet. Struggling with job losses and a livelihood crisis, education for their children is going to an added challenge.Migrant labourers are still struggling to reach home from various parts of the country and clearly, they are not going to return any time soon even if the lockdown is lifted. Industrial productivity for at least two quarters is therefore going to be affected, and consequently, employment. While these are the mega challenges before the government calling for major policy interventions, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced us to take four basic precautions: wear a mask in public places, use the sanitiser and handwash frequently, maintain social distance and avoid crowded places. It has forced us to adopt better hygiene and sanitation…at least for now. In the containment clusters, the Pune municipal corporation has been cleaning public toilets thrice a day, and hopefully, all public toilets will be better maintained in the future. The pandemic has forced us to go digital faster than we expected. It has encouraged us to pay greater attention to our health with immunity-boosting diets and a dose of daily exercise.Coping with the future in a post-Covid-19 situation would mean work-from-home becoming routine, requiring us to work efficiently from home and re-orienting ourselves, digitally and otherwise. Offices, restaurants and public spaces will need to be re-structured to ensure social distancing. It’s not going to the same again, at least for the next year or two, till a vaccine becomes a proven prophylactic against the disease. Who would have thought that we would be fast-forwarded into the future within a matter of weeks?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monday-musings-coping-with-covid-19-as-we-fast-forward-into-the-future/story-kxC3gTYKPkAxNf59BGri9J.html

We have made precautionary rules mandatory for all shop owners, in which workers from containment zones will not be allowed in the market. And we have appealed to all shop owners to create awareness amongst the customers about public health safety and taking precautions while shopping” added Pandit.Meanwhile, citizens and women in particular are happy about Tulshibaug market resuming operations.Sonali Mehta, a Pune resident said, “Since the lockdown has started we were not able to go out unless it was for essential items that we need daily.

01-06-2020||Mumbai||Bodies left on hospital beds as coronavirus overwhelms Mumbai||Hospital wards with corpses left unattended in hallways. Patients asked to sleep on the floor until beds open up. A woman with brain damage who died because she was refused medical help until her family could prove she was virus-free.The public health-care system in Mumbai, epicenter of India’s worsening coronavirus outbreak, is overwhelmed as Covid-19 patients pour in and hospital staff work around the clock. Medical care for non-coronavirus patients has basically been shut off due to a lack of resources.“We are opening new wards daily but they get filled by end of day with Covid-19 patients. It is pretty bad right now,” said Saad Ahmed, a resident doctor at state-run King Edward Memorial Hospital in central Mumbai. “All wards are now Covid-19 wards and they are full to the capacity.”Despite a strict two-month-long lockdown, the outbreak in India’s financial capital has snowballed, with the city now accounting for more than a fifth of India’s over 5,400 deaths and 190,600 infections. The pandemic’s center is shifting away from New York and Europe to nations like Brazil and India, where under-funded health care infrastructure and poor living conditions provide fertile ground for the virus. India’s virus death toll overtook China’s on Thursday.A Twitter video earlier this month showed corpses of virus victims left on beds next to patients in a hospital ward in Mumbai’s state-run Lokmanya Tilak Hospital. The hospital probed the incident and replaced its dean. Pictures recently emerged of bodies left unattended in the hallways of King Edward Memorial hospital.New UntouchablesBodies have piled up in hospitals in the last few weeks after family members refused to claim them out of a fear of infection, said Madhuri Ramdas Gaikar, a nurse at the King Edward Memorial hospital. The intense fear around the virus has created a new class of untouchables in India, with the infected and their families being shunned by their neighbors or shunted out of rented apartments.“We used to keep the paperwork and everything else ready, still bodies were not being taken away,” said Gaikar.Hospitals’ emergency wards are seeing twice the number of patients they have beds for, said a doctor in a state-run hospital who did not want to be named fearing repercussions from her employer. That meant one oxygen station had to service multiple patients and some were forced to share beds, she said.The other bottleneck is in critical care facilities and health care staff -- doctors, nurses, lab technicians and cleaning staff -- as many are infected or quarantined.“Critical patients are struggling hard to get beds everywhere in Mumbai,” said Vikas Oswal, a private sector chest physician who also sees patients in the state-run Shatabdi Hospital. “It takes 12-16 hours to find a single bed. Beds get filled up immediately with next patient in queue.”Even as India started implementing a phased exit from the world’s biggest lockdown, Maharashtra -- the state where Mumbai is located -- on Sunday extended the stay-at-home measures in the metropolis to June 30. Some small relaxations will kick in from June 5 in Mumbai such as allowing shops and markets to open on alternate days.Fear Of InfectionWhile other virus epicenters from Wuhan to New York and Bergamo in Italy have seen similarly overwhelmed hospitals, Mumbai’s situation is compounded -- some say created -- by the reluctance of its massive and better-equipped private health system to get involved in virus care out of a fear of infection.There was a shortage of beds for Intensive Care Units, or ICUs, and critical care initially when the pandemic broke out but it has largely been mitigated now, according to Sanjay Oak, a physician heading Mumbai’s virus task force set up in April by the Maharashtra government.The state government has taken over 80% of general category beds and all the ICU beds in the city’s private health care facilities, Oak said in an email. These beds “are displayed and alloted through a common dash board” at an affordable price, he said.Despite these efforts, some patients are still getting crowded out.Members of a family, who did not want to be identified for fear of being stigmatized, spent a night in an ambulance after three private hospitals refused to hospitalize their elderly diabetic mother who had a fever and bouts of shivering. The private facilities insisted on a certificate showing she was virus-free, and kept redirecting her to the public hospitals.The woman was asked to spend the night on the floor at a state-run hospital as she waited for her test results, as there were no vacant beds, said one of her relatives. The family chose to take her away and keep trying other hospitals.S Kumar, a social worker in Mumbai, struggled to secure medical help for a woman who had suffered brain damage after a fall at home. At least three leading private hospitals insisted on a certificate saying she didn’t have Covid-19 before starting treatment, according to Kumar. The woman died before her treatment could start.“Treatment delayed is treatment denied,” Kumar said, adding that he had seen at least half a dozen deaths in the past six weeks due to lack of timely medical care.Social InequalityThe chaotic situation has also exposed the consequences of the social inequality that divides and defines Mumbai, where globe-trotting executives live in condominiums next to slums where their drivers, cooks and house cleaners reside.The city’s deep-seated issues make it the perfect breeding ground for the highly-contagious pathogen, blunting the government’s efforts. It also houses Dharavi, Asia’s most-crowded slum, where as many as eight people may be staying in a 100-square-feet tin hutment and 80 sharing a public toilet.Stigma has complicated contact tracing and social distancing efforts especially in slum clusters with health care workers being obstructed and cops being pelted with stones.Local authorities have been aggressively ramping up facilities, readying as many as 100,000 beds by creating quarantine facilities everywhere from a race course to a planetarium and a nature park. A new 1,000 bed Covid-19 hospital was built from scratch within two weeks and started last week.The local public health officials also sent notices to 75,000 private sector doctors to be ready for a two-week mandatory virus duty to rest the extremely fatigued and overworked public sector health care workers.Slowing The VirusAggressive disinfecting and contact tracing has helped slow the rate at which virus cases are doubling across Mumbai. In the slum cluster of Dharavi, the pace is now 20 days instead of three in April.While there are enough beds for non-critical and asymptomatic patients, Shatabdi Hospital’s Oswal said the real crunch was in beds, ventilators and oxygen stations for critical patients.Patients come gasping for breath and sometimes couldn’t be saved, said the government hospital doctor cited earlier.“The health care system will soon be placed in a very difficult situation where they have to make a choice between who to provide care to and who to simply say, ‘sorry, we can’t do anything for you’,” said Vivekanand Jha, executive director of the George Institute of Global Health in India.For doctors and nurses at the frontlines, challenges mount.There have been instances where relatives have just left the patients in wards and taken off scared that they might catch the virus, according to Ahmed, the doctor at King Edward Memorial Hospital.“Health care staff has taken round-the-clock care of such patients,” he said. “We don’t know their names or history but have to start their treatment anyway.”Sword Over Your HeadSome medical workers said that media coverage of bad conditions in government hospitals was demoralizing as they have been working relentlessly for weeks.Gaikar, the nurse at King Edward Memorial Hospital, hasn’t stayed with her nine-year-old daughter or husband for two months. Neither has she visited her elderly parents for fear of infecting them.“It’s a very difficult fight, as your own life is at stake,” Gaikar said. “There is this sword always hanging over your head. Will I test positive when my swab is taken after the duty?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bodies-left-on-hospital-beds-as-coronavirus-overwhelms-mumbai/story-VXZBmFzIY38Uen87fgZ6pJ.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai suburbs experience cloudy sky, light showers||Mumbaikars and people in neighbouring areas woke up to cloudy weather and light rain on Monday morning following the formation of a low pressure area in the Arabian Sea.The depression in the Arabian Sea is likely to intensify into a severe cyclone and cross the north Maharashtra and south Gujarat coasts on June 3, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said.The light showers/drizzle in parts of Mumbai city, its suburbs and neighbouring districts of Thane and Palghar on Monday morning brought some respite to people from the sweltering heat and humidity.Dharavi, the slum pocket of Mumbai, recorded the highest 31.46 mm downpour in the past 24 hours, according to IMD’s website.On Sunday also, some parts of the state, including Pune, witnessed rain with thunderstorm and gusty winds.“Maharashtra state experienced rain with thunderstorms associated with gusty winds especially in interiors in last 24 hours,” IMD Mumbai’s deputy director general of meteorology K S Hosalikar said in a tweet on Monday.Light rain coupled with thunder and lightning was reported in parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) since 4 am on Monday. But, the rain intensity reduced considerably after 7 am in most parts of the city.In the last 24 hours, 0.2 mm rain was recorded in suburban Santacruz and 2 mm rain at Colaba in south Mumbai, according to IMD’s website.The highest 31.46 mm rain was recorded at Dharavi during the period, it said.No untoward incident related to rain was reported, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday appealed to fishermen not to venture into the sea.The state government has stepped up safety measures along the Konkan coast to tackle any eventuality.Thackeray last week held a meeting on monsoon preparedness with officials of the government, IMD, BMC, and the Army, Navy and Air Force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-suburbs-experience-cloudy-sky-light-showers/story-RNl5QmTbn7hiiJAzgjpEHN.html
01-06-2020||Gurugram||Long queues at Delhi-Gurugram border as commuters unaware of restrictions||Long queues of vehicles were seen at the Delhi-Gurugram border on Monday as people were not aware of restrictions on movement. “The state government announced yesterday that inter-state travel is allowed, but today they are not allowing us as we do not have any movement pass,” a commuter told ANI. Sanjay Kapoor, who came from Delhi’s Rohini and was heading to Sohna road said: “Earlier, they were allowing vehicles. Now, police are stopping us. They are saying that people with passes will be allowed.”Earlier in the morning, vehicles were seen moving freely at the Delhi-Gurugram border without any checks. A similar situation was seen at the Delhi-Ghaziabad border near Ghazipur but the district administration of Gautam Buddha Nagar decided to seal its border.Uttar Pradesh Police officials were seen checking check passes and identity cards of people entering the district at the Noida-Delhi border near Delhi’s Mayur Vihar Extension area and at the Delhi Noida Direct Flyway.As per a report of the Gautam Buddha Nagar health department, ‘source of infection in 42 per cent of the COVID-19 cases in the last 20 days has been tracked to Delhi’.Meanwhile, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the borders of the national capital have been sealed for the next one week and only essential services will be allowed amid a surge in COVID-19 positive cases here.The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) in its new guidelines on Saturday, which will be applicable after the end of the fourth phase of lockdown on May 31, has said that there shall be no restriction on interstate and intrastate movement.Also, no separate permission/approval/ e-permit will be required for such movements.However, if a state or union territory, based on reasons of public health and its assessment of the situation proposes to regulate the movement of persons, it will give wide publicity in advance regarding the restrictions to be placed on such movement and the related procedures to be followed.(The story has been published from a wire feed without any modifications to the text, only the headline has been changed.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/long-queues-at-delhi-gurugram-border-as-commuters-unaware-of-restrictions/story-DaxIVvtCLLBdyh5vnHVsVJ.html

01-06-2020||Chandigarh||No crime against women should go undetected, unregistered and unpunished: Himachal DGP||Shimla: A day after taking charge as the Himachal Pradesh director general of police (DGP), Sanjay Kundu, 56, a 1989-batch Indian Police Service officer, listed out his priorities that include tackling crimes against women, containing drug trade, and improving the police’s image besides ensuring the welfare of police personnel. He said his motto will be: “No crime against women should go undetected, unregistered and unpunished.” Excerpts:What is your immediate priority as DGP?It’s addressing the public health crisis arising out of Covid-19 pandemic. Besides, the state police are committed to checking drug trafficking, consumption and addiction of narcotics and synthetic drugs. Traditionally, cannabis grown in Kullu and higher reaches has been trafficked out of Himachal Pradesh, but for the past few years, chitta (made from heroin) and other synthetic drugs are being smuggled into the state. This has led to increase in drug abuse, particularly among youngsters. This problem strikes at the root of society and must be tackled on priority.The image of the Himachal Pradesh Police took a beating after the Kotkhai gangrape and custodial death case in 2017.The key to improving the image of the police is to go back to fundamental policing. This involves strengthening the beat and patrol system, maintaining crime records, monitoring and reviewing crime cases, and senior officials inspecting police stations. There is no substitute for diligence. The force should concentrate on its professional work and results will speak for themselves.Drug trade in the state is worrying.It is a serious problem and strikes at the root of society. The focus will be on developing robust intelligence, crime mapping and network tracing besides undercover operations to catch the big fish and not just petty drug peddlers. Professional investigation is being conducted in drug crimes to ensure the traffickers are punished and their properties forfeited.National Crime Record Bureau (NCRB) data shows crime against women is on the rise in Himachal Pradesh. What is your strategy to control it?I will work with the motto of no crime against women should go unregistered, undetected and unpunished. There are two reasons for this increase. One is that the physical numbers of these crimes are increasing and secondly, courts have enlarged the definition of such crimes so there is freer registration. But this situation can’t be allowed to prevail. Women form 50% of the population and it’s essential they feel safe for society to progress.Cyber crime is an emerging problem. How will it be dealt with?The common man needs to be educated about the pitfalls through information, education and communication (IEC). Cyber awareness and hygiene is needed for different age groups and organisations. Our cyber forensic lab needs to be upgraded. We will ensure that public wi-fi and websites have robust security features so that they are not compromised.Will the police commissionerate system be implemented, particularly in bigger districts?I see strong merit in the police commissionerate system as it is the answer to modern day real time crime and law and order. Most states follow this system. I will strongly recommend to the state government to introduce this system in Shimla and Dharamshala.The threat of terror activities looms along the state’s border in Chamba district with Jammu and Kashmir. What steps are being taken to tighten security?Terrorist activities in Jammu and Kashmir have in the last couple of years changed their genre. While the Jammu division, which borders Chamba has seen relative peace, Himachal Pradesh can’t lower its guard. I would like the inter-state intelligence meetings between J&K, Punjab and Himachal to be reinvigorated. We need to maintain close ties with the military intelligence and external intel agencies.What will you do to strengthen the state police, particularly investigation agencies?We need to make investigation in HP Police top rate. This is not an option but an imperative. I would like my investigators to be trained in the best institutes of India and abroad, improve forensic science and forensic medicine capabilities and bring them to state-of-the-art level.Do law and order and investigation wings need to be separate for better management?This talk has been around for a while. On paper, they have been separated but on the ground, the two wings are still together. There is merit in the separation of the wings and to make this happen, I’ll follow it up with the state government to support HP Police with resources in the form of finances, legislation, rules, infrastructure and training.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-crime-against-women-should-go-undetected-unregistered-and-unpunished-himachal-dgp/story-gsMgv2MzumXM9XwFn4HddN.html

We surveyed the area and found the pest present on 230 hectares, but the area was difficult to access so we decided to use the drone,” said BR Kadwa, deputy director of the Rajasthan agriculture department, in Jaipur. It’s the second time in a week that a drone had been deployed to spray pesticide on locust swarms in Jaipur district. A drone sent by the central government for locust control operations was used on swarms of the insect in Samode, about 40km north-west of Jaipur, on the night of May 26. Heavy rain that continued until 10.30 pm , in addition to the difficult terrain, impeded Saturday night’s operation. “We could launch the operation only around midnight,” he added. “ The locust swarms could be controlled only in 105 hectare; teams couldn’t reach the remaining areas.

01-06-2020||Delhi||Covid-19 Lockdown: Despite govt order, online studies still a struggle for EWS students||Malkeet Singh’s 12-year-old son, a Class 6 student at a private school in west Delhi, is worried ever since his school switched to online lessons and tests following the Covid-19 lockdown. As no one in his family owned a smartphone, he was unable to appear for the seven tests conducted by his school recently.“We had repeatedly conveyed our problem to the class teacher and the school but to no avail,” said Singh, a contractual driver who lost his job during the lockdown imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. Singh’s children are among the several hundred students admitted under the Economically Weaker Section quota in the 1,700 private schools in the capital every year and are entitled to free education. Parents with an annual income of less than ₹1 lakh can seek admission under the EWS quota.However, the switch from classroom teaching to online education has left them in the lurch.Earlier this month, Hindustan Times had reported that students enrolled in private schools under the Economically Weaker Section quota are struggling to attend online classes due to the lack of devices and high-speed Internet and have been unable to take their exams as well. A plea in this regard was also filed in the Delhi High Court by the NGO Justice For All which contended that over 50,000 such students would be affected by the decision of private schools to conduct online education.“Schools can make temporary provisions for students who are not able to access online education. Instead, they have been ignoring these children who are unable to catch up due to lack of access to devices or the Internet. An alternative mechanism should be arranged for such students so that their academic year is not under threat,” said advocate Shikha Sharma, secretary of Justice for All.Despite the Delhi government’s submission in the ongoing case—which said that under the Right to Education Act, schools should provide equipment if such children were unable to access online education—little has changed on the ground.Laxman, a resident of Nangloi who works as a carpenter, said that his family had no means of getting a smartphone with his meagre means. The family is currently struggling to ensure that their son finishes his holiday homework on time. “My son, who studies in Class 3, had his tests earlier this month. Since we have no high-end smartphone or computer, we had to borrow phones from our relatives or neighbours and all his submissions were delayed. While formulating plans of how to conduct studies during this pandemic, schools and authorities should think of alternative measures for families like ours as well,” he said.Families with multiple children also had their own share of struggles. “There is just one phone in the house and I have three children. They have all received tons of homework and we don’t know how to help them all. There are constant fights between them to attend classes,” Rakesh Thakur, a Kalyanpuri resident, whose children study in classes 5, 3, and 2, said.SK Bhattacharya, the president of Action Committee of Unaided Recognized Private Schools, said it wasn’t practically feasible for private schools to bear the additional burden of providing smartphones and laptops to children and wait for the reimbursement from the Centre.“We haven’t received any written complaint from EWS students on the matter so far. I don’t think there is anyone in Delhi who does not own a smartphone. Besides, they should also look at what is happening in government schools. Why this targeting of private schools? If they are so sympathetic to the cause, they should distribute laptops among all such students,” he said.“Government schools are conducting online classes for classes 9 to 12, which is outside the ambit of the Right to Education Act. Private schools are conducting online classes for everyone, including junior-level classes up to Class 8. The RTE Act clearly mandates that the educational material has to be provided by schools. So while during regular teaching, the books and materials were provided by private schools, the necessities of online education should also be provided by them,” a senior official from the Directorate of Education said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-19-lockdown-despite-govt-order-online-studies-still-a-struggle-for-ews-students/story-bSNaG0wUDT9eeFj29JyucI.html

The move will make medical education impossible for the middle class and economically weaker strata. We request the CM to roll back the MBBS fee in Punjab.”Other disgruntled members of the association claimed the government had earlier hiked the fee by 160% in 2015. “Now 5 years later, again a hike of 80% has been announced, which is a clear violation of the Supreme Court orders prohibiting any institution from increasing the fee beyond 15% in a minimum of three years. Punjab has hiked MBBS fee twice within 4 years,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/medical-students-urge-cm-to-roll-back-mbbs-fee-hike-in-punjab/story-Fce9Efi3biS91SxXRAfMML.html

Besides organising protests in front of the incinerator site in Sector 25, we have also started a campaign to collect signatures of residents to oppose the move.”A resident of Sector 38 West, Raman Sharma, said, “The ash emanating from the incinerator will lead to pollution of air and the rivulet, Patiala ki Rao, which passes through the area. The storing of carcasses will also lead to the spread of foul smell and diseases.” Sector 25 West councillor Sheela Devi said, “I have written letters to the UT adviser, the commissioner and the UT administrator against the decision. A meeting of residents of Sector 25 will be held to get their views on the issue on Monday.”Sector 38 West councillor Arun Sood said, “Earlier, the proposal in the agenda of the MC House meeting was for setting up the incinerator in the Industrial Area. But, councillors of that area protested and opposed it. However, I assured them that no foul smell will emanate from there. Later, the possibility of setting up the incinerator in Sector 25 was discussed. “Chandigarh Congress president Pradeep Chabbra also opposed the decision and said that party workers would stage protests if the plant is set up in Sector 25 West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/residents-oppose-setting-up-of-animal-carcass-incinerator-in-chandigarh-s-sector-25-west/story-ndgEnM14zPeG0mNgde9RqK.html

However, when they reached Arvind’s house they panicked after seeing policemen there as he had been provided security by Punjab police and returned to his brother’s bungalow where they opened fire, hitting the windows and his Land Rover SUV’s windshield, and fled.Taking stock of the situation with senior police officials, Chandigarh senior superintendent of police (SSP) Nilambari Jagadale said: “Seventeen shots were fired and it appears two pistols were used as the shells recovered were from 9mm and 32 bore pistols. There were no casualties and we have accessed the CCTV footage of the assailants. A message was flashed to the Punjab and Haryana control rooms as well to help nab the assailants who drove away.” A leading liquor dealer in Punjab, Arvind said in his complaint to the police that his mother Usha Singla had called him from Rakesh Singla’s house to tell him that some people had come to meet him. “But I was in the bathroom and couldn’t take her call. After seeing the police outside my house they drove back to my brother’s house where both my brother and mother were present and opened fire in what seems to be frustration.”Arvind’s family has been in the liquor retail business for generations. Rakesh Singla, who owns hotels and businesses in Chandigarh, denied any rivalries being the cause of the shootings. “We have been in the liquor business for many years and have no rivalries. No threats have been received before this,” he added.Three police teams with the SSP were present at the spot and questioned Rakesh Singla about any individuals he suspected were involved in the incidents.Police, who were screening CCTV footage from cameras in the area, said the faces of all four men were covered.

This has forced the Punjab government to discuss direct benefit transfers of subsidies to farmers and other measures that could potentially affect their livelihood. By forcing the states to act in a certain manner, the centre is attempting to dictate their economic policy,” the MP stated in the letter.He added, “I caution that such moves will cause resentment among the citizens, especially in these economically distressing times. Rather than providing succour to our farmers, such reforms will only penalise them further.”He urged the PM to reconsider such a structural adjustment approach during this distressed economic situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/power-reforms-to-raise-borrowing-limit-not-ok-bajwa-to-pm/story-ZEr8Ksd50AmKrZpFpfA4wI.html

01-06-2020||Chandigarh||80% units in Punjab resume ops, but demand dip, labour shortage a worry||As state prepares to enter the lockdown 5.0 on Monday, 80% of the registered industrial units in Punjab reeling under the impact of the global pandemic, are slowly lumbering back on track.Of the total 2.59 lakh registered units, 2.07 lakh have restarted their production lines at limited capacity with reduced workforce while adhering to social distancing norms. Though 80% industrial units have become operational, about two-thirds of the workers – 13.65 lakh – are back at work as per the data compiled by the state industries department. The registered units employed 20.29 lakh workers before the coronavirus-induced curfew forced them to down their shutters more than two months ago.Bulk of these units resumed production during the 15-day lockdown 4.0 period, which commenced on May 17, as restrictions were eased by the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) whereas only 17,301, or say 6.6%, factories were working till then. The state government’s decision to permit all tiny and cottage units in non-containment zones and simplification of the process of granting permissions also helped the industrial units resume their operations.53% FACTORIES OPERATING WITH LESS THAN 10 WORKERSAbout 1.1 lakh, or say 53%, of the factories are operating currently with less than 10 workers, according to official data. Another 71,020 units are operating with 10 to 25 workers and the remaining 25,913 have more than 25 workers each. Industries director Sibin C said as per the feedback received from the industry, there are several issues related to labour deficiency, supply chain disruption and availability of raw material for several manufactures. “These are fallouts of lockdown and will take some time to stabilise. As for the units which are still to start their production, we have asked general managers of district industries centres to find out so that difficulties, if any, can be removed,” he said. In the state’s industrial hub of Ludhiana, which is home to 95,202 units, 74,271 have resumed productions and 40% of them are small and cottage factories running their operations with less than 10 workers each. In Jalandhar and Amritsar, the percentage of operational industrial units is higher at 94 and 82%, respectively.INDUSTRY REMAINS ON EDGEDespite the revival of business activity in most parts of the country, though slowly, the industry has worries on several fronts. PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry (PHDCCI) chairman, Punjab, Karan Gilhotra said labour shortage, disruption in supply chain and decline in demand were a serious challenge for the industry even though their impact varies from sector to sector.“There are also issues related to the availability of raw material, orders are getting cancelled and stocks piling up. If demand does not up pick up soon, things are going to get tougher for the industry in days to come. It is a vicious circle,” said the member of a group of experts set up to develop post-Covid economic strategy for Punjab, citing the examples of automobile and textile sectors.Echoing similar sentiments, Federation of Industrial and Commercial Organisation (FICO) president Gurmeet Singh Kular termed the drop in demand and labour availability as his biggest concerns. “There is hardly any market demand and the situation is bad. There is need to infuse liquidity to get the economy going and give a boost to market demand.

For instance, medical teams are stationed outside the Golden Temple and the Durgiana Temple to screen devotees.”The minister said there was no community spread in the city and asked the residents not to panic. This came a day after Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said there was community transmission of the virus in Amritsar.Sidhu held a meeting with the officials concerned and instructed them to make proper arrangements to prevent any further spread of the coronavirus.“The majority of patients have travel history or are contacts of those infected earlier. Amritsar has an international airport and a large railway junction. People stranded due to the lockdown are arriving here from other states and abroad and it is the main cause of the spread,” he said.Taking a dig at private hospitals, the minister said, “Private hospitals totally stayed away from contributing to the battle against the pandemic. It is the health department staff, police and other government functionaries who acted as frontline warriors. Private hospital doctors have joined the medical profession for earning money while those working with the government did it to serve people.” Sidhu paid obeisance at the Golden Temple and partook of langar in the community kitchen of the shrine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/medical-teams-to-screen-devotees-punjab-health-minister-on-opening-of-shrines/story-1Vpd3rKxSsqXppEVHnbAGK.html

The PAIS app allows Punjab Police to digitize criminal records and automate criminal search and various critical analysis at ground zero. With features like facial recognition, PAIS retrieves information of criminals from the records, in real-time. It further supports police personnel via innovative features like gang analysis, phonetic search and more.SSP Mandeep Singh Sidhu said two proclaimed offenders, Shiva and Vishal Kumar, both wanted in NDPS act cases, were stopped at a checkpoint near Gagan Chowk for not wearing a mask. “Their behaviour aroused suspicion among policemen on duty, who clicked their pictures and uploaded these on the PAIS app. Data stored on the app revealed that both had a criminal record,” the SSP said, adding that through the app, data, if any, of the criminal background of the suspect is immediately sent to the officer concerned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/patiala-police-nab-2-criminals-using-face-recognition-app/story-ZiGYD3Bh0GzUbSPls5S2JJ.html

The National democratic Alliance (NDA) government is blatantly interfering with the rights of the states as far as fiscal borrowing is concerned. Did the SAD president (Sukhbir) not remember his own party’s Anandpur Sahib resolution?” they questioned. The party which calls itself the champion of the rights of the states is hand in glove with the NDA government, they claimed.“The Centre was interfering with the borrowing rights of the states. Instead of opposing this draconian decision, the Akali leaders, to cover up for the crime against the people of the nation, are hatching a conspiracy to mislead the masses by making baseless statements about electricity bills. CM Capt Amarinder Singh has already made it clear farmers will continue to get free electricity,” the ministers said. Parkash Singh Badal, they said, must break his silence on the issue and ask Sukhbir to resign from the post of the party president and recall Harsimrat from the Union ministry. “The Badals have abandoned the long cherished principles of the Akali Dal to further their personal interests,” they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/badals-complicit-in-dismantling-country-s-federalism-ministers/story-x3N0K3BWVXx5D4G5BU1M0I.html

01-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh’s ₹241-crore smart-meter project to see delay due to labour exodus||Large-scale labour exodus amid the coronavirus-induced lockdown is set to delay the start of the recently approved pan-city smart-meter project in Chandigarh.The Rs 241-crore central government project envisages installation of 2.5 lakh smart meters for electricity connections in the city.Currently, the UT engineering department is implementing a pilot project of installing 25,000 smart meters in a few localities.The city-wide project was approved by the central government in March just before the lockdown and curfew was imposed for the containment of Covid-19. All civic and developmental works came to a standstill after the imposition of the curfew orders.“After the lockdown relaxations were introduced, we had expected the work to start. But as soon as inter-state movement of migrant workers was allowed, most labourers left for their hometowns, leaving a labour shortage in the city. This will hit the start of ambitious smart-meter project,” said a senior UT official, requesting anonymity.ONLY 500 METERS INSTALLED SO FARThe department is already struggling to implement the pilot project of installing 26,000 smart meters in few selected pockets across the city.In the first phase of the Smart Grid Project, in October 2018, the department had allotted the work for installing smart meters in Sectors 29, 31, 47, and 48, six villages -- Faidan, Ram Darbar, Hallomajra, Raipur Kalan, Makhanmajra, and Daria-- and the Industrial Area.The pilot project was to be completed by June 2020, but, so far, only 500 smart meters have been installed. “Labour shortages are hampering of the pilot project too,” said the official.ESSENTIAL FOR LAUNCHING PRE-PAID SERVICESThe new system will be beneficial both for the department and consumers.The new meters will send immediate tamper alerts to the Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) centre, and allow the department to keep a track of load, voltage, outages, peak demand and consumption across the city. Besides, the power control room will also receive immediate alerts in case of tripping in main lines. Residents will benefit as smart meters will allow prepaid services to be started. “Consumers will be able to opt for pre-paid services, such as in case of like a mobile services, for electricity consumption. Instead of paying bi-monthly bills, they can now pay only for what they expect to consume,” said the official. Significantly, in its latest report, the joint electricity regulatory commission (JERC) had directed the department to expedite the process of procurement and installation of smart meters. The department acquired 5,000 meters recently for the pilot project.Under the smart grid project, approved by National Smart Grid Mission (NSGM), the UT administration has planned to install smart electricity meters, which are part of power sector reforms. JERC had sought a progress report on Smart Grid project from the department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-s-rs-241-crore-smart-meter-project-to-see-delay-due-to-labour-exodus/story-TJ9XYOC0KIQnB5z3mICgNO.html

01-06-2020||Chandigarh||World Milk Day: Punjab’s dairy farmers in doldrums||Though its World Milk Day on Monday, there is no cheer for dairy farm owners in Punjab as their business has taken a huge hit amid the Covid-19 lockdown.They rue that first the lockdown, and then the migrant exodus broke the back of the dairy industry.Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University (GADVASU)’s extension education director Harsh Vema said that with a production of three crore litres of milk a day, the state is the highest producer of milk in the country.Milk-driven industries such as tea, coffee, sweets, chocolates and ice-creams also remained closed due to lockdown, which added to the losses.Haibowal Dairy Complex Association chairman Paramjit Singh Bobby said the migrant population and roadside tea sellers formed a significant chunk of milk consumers. Also, fewer wedding functions and closing of offices and shops hit the dairy sale badly.“This caused heavy losses to the dairy business. We demand that the rates should be revised from ₹6.50 to ₹7 per kg to revive the dairy farming industry. By June 11, the rates will be revised. There may be an increase of ₹2 per litre,” said Bobby.Butta Singh, a dairy farmer who is rearing 30 buffaloes, said that earlier, there was a huge demand for paneer at sweet shops.“Further, paneer and curd used to be sold in wedding functions. However, due to the lockdown, there was no sale for nearly two months. The government has given some relaxation, but the business has not picked up fully. Currently, I need to buy fodder but I have run out of cash. It is time that the government should do something to save the industry,” he said.DS Hans, deputy director, Dairy Development Board, said dairy products are in heavy demand during the wedding season. However, due to the lockdown, sales plummetted.The milk collection was increased from 4 lakh to 7 lakh litre per day to save the farmers from running into financial crisis. Further, eight milk processing units, which were closed, were also opened within 10 days of the lockdown.“We have enough stock of ghee and skimmed milk and are hoping that government agencies will pick it soon,” Hans said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/world-milk-day-punjab-s-dairy-farmers-in-doldrums/story-rrADoeMBqcv237TgClC6VP.html

Their count remains 114 and 26, respectively. While nine cases are active in Mohali, the number is just one in Panchkula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-short-lull-five-new-cases-surface-in-chandigarh/story-VCjwsjPg8UZZcQ6s0RCkIJ.html
01-06-2020||City||Two-passenger policy costing Ambala auto drivers dear||After easing of lockdown restrictions, auto-rickshaws have been allowed to ply after more than one-and-a-half months on the roads of the twin cities here.Due to the coronavirus scare and scorching heat, there are already fewer people on the roads, and the two-passenger policy for auto drivers is making it much more difficult for them to cover even their fuel costs and, ultimately, passengers will be made to pay a higher fare.Anil Kumar, 37, who has been driving an auto for the past two decades in Ambala cantonment, said, “The meagre fare due to two-passenger policy for autos doesn’t even cover my fuel cost. I started driving my auto three days ago, but there are not many people out on the roads.” “Do hi allowed hain, lekin hum gap rakh ke teen log bitha lete hain, majboori hai,” Anil said, while negotiating with a customer of Shahabad.He said, “During the lockdown, I had to borrow money from a friend to survive with my family of five with parents living in Bihar. My parents were not well and I had to send some money for them too. I don’t know when I’ll be able to return the money to my friend.” Another driver said, “We used to charge minimum ₹10 and maximum ₹20 from passengers, but now I’ve to charge ₹150 for a one-side ride from two or three passengers.”A passenger, travelling from the cantonment to the city in an auto, said, “We understand auto drivers’ situation and that is why I have to pay ₹70 instead of normal fare of ₹10.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-passenger-policy-costing-dear-to-auto-drivers-in-ambala/story-lGLP9h9VxxMdhowVtbSn0H.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body starts therapy for 1,615 senior citizens with low oxygen levels||In a bid to reduce the Covid-19 mortality rate, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has screened 2,42,653 senior citizens since April 25 and identified 1,615 of them till Sunday, whose blood oxygen saturation level is below 95%. BMC has now started oxygen therapy for those with low oxygen levels at designated hospitals.The civic body’s data has revealed that of all Covid-19 deaths in the city, 67% cases had been of those suffering from comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, heart ailments and chronic respiratory diseases, and a majority of these cases are of those above the age of 60-70 years.To identify those in the high-risk category, BMC’s 400 teams of community health volunteers and Asha (accredited social health activist) workers have started door-to-door surveys, focusing on screening of senior citizens, using pulse oximeters.“This screening method is very important, as we have been able to identify more than 1,600 vulnerable senior citizens and successfully provide them medical treatment at the right time. Our teams have visited around 14,07,726 houses and screened 2.42 lakh senior citizens. Without this screening method, it would have been difficult to control the mortality rate in the age group of 60 years and above,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy director, BMC health department.The teams carrying out the survey are also creating awareness among locals on the outbreak, how to take care of senior citizens, and where to report if a resident develops symptoms.Of the 67% cases in which patients who died had comorbidities, 26% had diabetes, 24% hypertension, while 32% had both, diabetes and hypertension. Around 8% of these patients had heart ailments, while the remaining 10% had other comorbidities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-starts-therapy-for-1-615-senior-citizens-with-low-oxygen-levels/story-2OwtYyxDZgsphX9a1J8WrL.html

Even as the country lifts lockdown in phases, the railway ministry has announced resuming the services of 200 outstation trains from Monday across India. Trains from Maharashtra will be operated on a daily, weekly and biweekly basis on the central, western and Konkan railway routes.However, the state government has not issued a standard operating protocol (SoP) yet over the quarantine procedure for passengers arriving in Maharashtra, once operations commence on Monday. “The quarantine protocol will be on the lines of the protocol for domestic passengers who travel by flights – those without any symptom will be asked to remain under home quarantine. The railways should ideally ensuring thermal screening and stamping of passengers,’’ said a senior official, privy to the development.However, the central and the Western Railway (WR) have chalked out the access plan and segregation of passenger traffic plans.“There will be only one entry and exit point to the railway stations in the city. On Monday, there will be four departures from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and four from Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT). Complete traffic management flow will be taken care of,” said KK Ashraf, senior divisional security commissioner, Central Railway. Some of the passenger trains that will operate on Monday are the Kushinagar Express, the Kamayani Express, Mahanagari Express, Bandra Terminus (BDTS)-Ghazhipur Express, Gorakhpur-LTT Express, BDTS-Gorakhpur Awadh Express, Pushpak Express, CSMT-Gadag Express, Udyan Express, Hussain Sagar Express and Nethravati Express.WR said it will also operate 17 pairs of passenger trains between Mumbai and Ahmedabad from Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/23-long-distance-train-services-to-begin-today-from-maharashtra/story-miKzWXWAtJqSVRx3wqgZ5I.html
01-06-2020||City||70 days after lockdown, Mumbaiites will be able to go for a walk, run from June 3||In a major respite to citizens after 70 days of lockdown, the state government has permitted outdoor activities such as walking, running, jogging and cycling in public open spaces from June 3.Much like major cities around the world, it has also encouraged cycling as a form of physical exercise “as it automatically ensures social distancing.” Cities like London, Dublin and Sydney are being reshaped to accommodate more cyclists and pedestrians.In its notification titled ‘Mission Begin Again’ released on Sunday, the state has permitted plumbers, electricians and pest-control services with masks, sanitisers and social-distancing norms to function between 5am and 7pm. While the notification is still not clear on allowing house help, a concern for many citizens in Mumbai, government officials said domestic help are allowed to be employed in red zones, if the housing societies allow. They are, however, not allowed to work in containment zones and they should not be coming from containment zones. In a text reply to HT, Bhushan Gagrani, a senior Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer who is also a member of the control room set up to deal with the outbreak, said, “We are silent on that [allowing domestic help]. Societies should take a call.” The state has permitted opening beaches, public and private playgrounds, however, it has advised citizens to only access nearby open spaces and avoid crowded spaces. “People are advised to stay outdoors only for purposes of physical activities for a limited duration,” the notification states.For phase 2 of the ‘Mission Begin Again’, which is effective from June 5, the state has asked citizens to walk or cycle to their neighbourhood markets. It has also discouraged citizens from taking out their vehicles for shopping.While transport experts said it is a positive step to encourage cycling, the state also needs to look at requisite infrastructure. “If cycling has to be looked at as a means of normal travel, the right infrastructure has to be provided and it has also to be incentivised. In case of open spaces, the number of cases in the city and state are still high, so people need to exercise caution,” said AV Shenory from the Mumbai Mobility Forum.Pranav Naik, a Mumbai-based architect, who mostly cycles to work, said the monsoon will prove to be a major difficulty for cyclists. “I had already kept my cycle away thinking I won’t use it now. It’s a good sign, but the monsoon will make it tough,” Naik said. Firoza Suresh, bicycle mayor of Mumbai, said, “It is the perfect time to encourage cycling in Indian cities as people might fear using shared mobility services. And now that we are talking about cycling, the state must look at the right infrastructure for it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/70-days-after-lockdown-mumbaiites-will-be-able-to-go-for-a-walk-run-from-june-3/story-Xbvql1wS1VaL9YCThibpAJ.html
01-06-2020||Lucknow||Revenue up, no proposal to levy new taxes: Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday said the state government’s revenue increased considerably in May vis-à-vis the poor earnings of April and there was no proposal to levy any new cess or tax to mobilise additional revenue in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.He made the assertion a day before the beginning of more phased relaxations, also known as Unlock 1, outside containment zones.“We have got good revenue this month with respect to the earnings of the last month (April 2020) and hence there is no proposal to levy any new tax or cess,” said Adityanath, while replying to a question at a video conference with journalists here on Sunday on the completion of one year of the Modi government’s second term.“Yes, the state government’s receipts will be over the Rs 5,000-crore mark by May 31, 2020 against Rs 2022 crore earned in April 2020. The state government spends a sum of Rs 12,000 crore to Rs 13,000 crore on salaries and pension. So, its earnings remain far behind the demand,” said a senior officer. “Hike in excise duty rates, opening of liquor shops and increase in VAT on petrol and diesel have added to the revenue this month,” the officer added. Yogi Adityanath, however, exuded confidence about bringing about an improvement in the situation following the beginning of Unlock-1. “After four stages of the lockdown, we will start unlock on Monday… We are going to start major activities in most of the areas barring the containment zones, where only doorstep delivery, medical screening and other essential services will be allowed. We have started the economic activities and will expedite the pace of work,” he said.“We have been able to get Rs 3 lakh crore investment in the past three years… We are making efforts to attract more investment. Teams have been formed. Desks for the US, South Korea and Japan have been set up to attract investment. Any company leaving China looks at UP as a potential destination. A German company did so recently,” he said.On the prime minister’s economic package, Yogi Adityanath said his government had been able to draw maximum advantage from the package owing to the state government’s expeditious work. “We are already getting maximum benefits from the PM’s package. The state will be able to get advantage on the basis of the pace of its work. We are satisfied with the benefits we have taken from the PM’s economic package and the Garib Kalyan package. We have derived maximum advantage, taken our existing welfare schemes forward and formulated new ones,” he said.“We are focusing on how to give concessions to the people. The state government has been making all efforts to start most of the industry and trading activities following social distancing norms. We will make efforts to break the chain of the coronavirus while giving a push to economic activities,” the chief minister said.He also said mass gathering would not be allowed under any circumstances while norms for various activities had been laid down. “Religious places will open from June 8. For social activities like marriages, norms have been laid down. We are giving relaxation and making efforts to make the people aware of the measures for protection. Protect yourself and help others protect themselves is the mantra to live with Covid-19,” the chief minister said.On the Opposition’s charge of the fudging of data, he said, “We have been able to provide 1.1 lakh beds in Covid hospitals in the state. This is the highest number in any state… We will take the testing capacity to 20,000 (samples) per day by June 30 against existing capacity of 10,000 tests per day. We have carried out 2.72 lakh tests up to now. I wish no leader of opposition parties needs to go to a Covid hospital to realise the facilities being provided there.”“But the opposition is indulging in negative politics and leaders who have not distributed even a food packet are making adverse comments on Twitter…. We have been provided fudged information about buses. We can’t play with the lives of people. We cannot accept this,” said Yogi Adityanath, without naming any party.Commenting on the move not to impose new taxes, Yashvir Tyagi, former professor of economics at Lucknow University, said, “I endorse the Yogi government’s decision not to impose any new taxes. Any new taxes will only bring down the purchasing power of the people. As the demand is low now, the government needs to give a boost to the economy. But the state government has to go a long way as its receipts are still lower than the expenditure.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/revenue-up-no-proposal-to-levy-new-taxes-yogi/story-FYWiasii6guuefncspbELO.html

The apartments have not even procured a no-objection certificate (NOC) from Dera Bassi’s fire department since 2015.As per a report, on Friday late evening a fire broke out in block number 16 due to leakage in an LPG cylinder and the furniture was gutted. Luckily the family members escaped unhurt.Kuldeep Singh Walia, an apartment allottee said, despite lodging several complaints with deputy commissioner, sub-divisional magistrate, cabinet minister and financial corporation commissioner of Punjab, no action has been taken against Housefed, which itself is a government undertaking.The 912-apartment project, of which 812 have been allotted, was completed in 2014. But when the fire department conducted an inspection, they found no fire safety arrangements in six towers numbered 35 to 40. Moreover, the inspection report said towers number 1 to 34 had no fire safety accessories, including branch pipes, hosepipes and landing valves.The allottees of the three-bedroom, two-bedroom and one-bedroom flats are paying ₹750, ₹650 and ₹400 per month as maintenance charges, respectively.Kaur Singh, president, Baba Zoravar Singh Cooperative House Building Society Limited, said, “We have applied for NOC from the fire department, but due to the nationwide lockdown, it has been delayed.”“We have already issued them notices to install the fire equipment, but they have not done it so far. We can only issue them NOCs after they complete their installation of fire safety equipment in several towers. In case of any mishap, the society will be held responsible,” said Pardeep Kumar, fire officer, Dera Bassi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-days-after-fire-breaks-out-in-apartment-report-shows-no-fire-equipment-installed-in-6-towers-of-housefed-society-in-punjab-s-banur/story-UfpVYzZ6xB55797dVAoBoL.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||Bengaluru-based firm produces two key enzymes for Covid-19 testing||As India has ramped up its Covid-19 testing capacities along with a push for domestic production of test kits, Bengaluru-based biotech company Richcore Lifesciences with help from scientists at the Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, and Indian Institute of Science Education and Research at Pune and Chandigarh have produced two key enzymes which are the main components of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) diagnostic kits.With the ongoing pandemic, availability of the two enzymes —Taq Polymerase and Reverse Transcriptase — has been an impediment towards the mass production of indigenous RT-PCR test kits both in India and across the globe. At present, these enzymes are imported and therefore very expensive. The ongoing lockdown has also proved to be an obstacle in their procurement.To detect the presence of the Sars-Cov2 virus that causes Covid-19, nasal and throat swab samples of symptomatic individuals are tested with RT-PCR method — considered the gold standard for Covid-19 diagnosis — and a positive or negative report is available within two hours or two days.“These two enzymes are very critical to the RT-PCR diagnostic kits because it allows conversion of the virus RNA to DNA. DNA is then amplified to make cDNA (copies of DNA) which confirms whether or not an individual is tested positive Covid-19,” said R Subramani, chairman and managing director, Richcore Lifesciences, which is part of the National Biomedical Resources Indigenisation Consortium (NBRIC) constituted by the department of biotechnology on May 5.“While the enzyme can be produced by small laboratories, but do so with standardised quality and USFDA approved cGMP certification is important. These enzymes form a key bottleneck in India’s efforts to mass-produce indigenous test kits,” said Subramani.Currently, samples of the enzymes are being supplied to diagnostic test kit manufacturers to confirm stability and consistency. “Once approved, we will able to mass-produce cGMP certified enzymes for millions of test kits in a few weeks,” said Subramani. Traditionally, reagents such as enzymes are the building block for any diagnostic kit. “We have always been dependent on importing reagents owing to lack of quality and scalability in India. Even if procurement took time, the situation didn’t call for panic,” said Taslimarif Saiyed, chief executive officer and director, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Platforms, Bengaluru. “But with the current situation, we are slowly and steadily realising that we need the reagents not only now but that going forward we also cannot rely on importing them,” said Saiyed.In addition to the high cost and increase in global demand for reagents, imports have also been hampered owing to the ongoing lockdown. “Therefore, even if start-ups or homegrown companies develop protocols for indigenous diagnostic kits, they need reagents to manufacture them. Domestically producing important enzymes as well as test kits can make us self-reliant in the future,” said Saiyed, who is also a convener of NBRIC governing council. NBRIC is a public-private partnership to boost indigenous innovations focused on developing reagents, diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bengaluru-based-firm-produces-two-key-enzymes-for-covid-19-testing/story-lrSWnaHuBY909I6vArH7lJ.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||Final year exams cancelled, announces Maharashtra CM Uddhav||Calming nerves of lakhs of students in the state, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Sunday clarified that universities in Maharashtra will not be holding any exams for those who are currently in the final year and will promote them based on their past performance.In his address to the state late on Sunday evening, Thackeray announced that with lockdown extended till June 30, the state will have no choice but to promote final-year students based on their performance of the previous semester and academic year. Details of this decision, however, are yet to be clarified by the state education department as well as universities.“Final-year results will be announced on the basis of aggregate marks scored by the student in the past semesters. Those students who feel they can perform better can do so by appearing for the exams that will be held in winter exam session [October-November 2020],” said Thackeray, in his speech on Sunday. This decision comes barely a day after Thackeray held a meeting with the state governor and chancellor of all state universities Bhagat Singh Koshyari, education minister and vice-chancellors of all state universities with the hope to find a solution to the problem of pending final-year examination. State minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant, in a separate online post, clarified that the state’s decision is clear and the same will be explained in detail to universities as well as students soon.In the first week of May, Samant held a Facebook live in order to announce the states decision to promote all first and second-year university students based on their current and previous semester performance whereas while final-year students will appear for exams in the month of July. He, however, had also clarified that in case the lockdown is extended till the end of June, the state government would have to rethink their plan to conduct exams for over eight lakh final-year students in Maharashtra.After Thackeray’s announcement, state cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray took to Twitter to laud the CM’s decision. “This decision brings huge relief to all students. I also thank the state education minister and VCs of all state universities for their participation in the decision to keep the balance between safeguarding life and academic excellence,” read his tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-exams-cancelled-says-cm-uddhav/story-jqMpOg2HUXrbQaiFyeDAEM.html

So far, the migrants have been unlucky to get a train to West Bengal, unlike migrants from the other states. Earlier, the Jesal Park ground, famously knows as Chowpatty, was the assembling point for passengers to board buses to reach Bhayander railway station to board trains to various destinations. Taking this into consideration, migrants from West Bengal have been assembling there in anticipation, said Dhiraj Parab, a social activist.Parab is among activists and volunteers who, with the help of administration, are alerting migrants not to assemble at the ground until informed through individual SMS alerts.A Majority of the WB bound migrants are jobless due to the nationwide lockdown since 23 March and are desperate to go back home,said Parab. As Mira-Bhayander is in a containment zone, we have no option but to return home to our native place where at least we can die in front of our relatives rather than meeting a solitary death and then the civic department taking away our bodies and cremating at some desolate place, said Kajal Dutta, a goldsmith expert in polishing gold.“Applications continue to pour in daily and so far 1,653 people have approached me [over getting on a train to West Bengal] and it may increase to 3,000,” said Rathin Datha a social worker.“Thane district collector should line up special trains immediately,” said Datha. Last week, a bus driver in Mira Road had duped nearly 60 migrants of Rs 2 lakh by offering them a ride to their hometown in Kolkata. Thane collectorate office has said no migrant should reach the assembly point unless there is a confirmation from the railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-from-west-bengal-assemble-in-bhyander-in-hope-of-returning-to-hometown/story-TE7uThAJFkSI7goj7RUlQM.html
01-06-2020||City||Kerala medical team to help Maharashtra battle Covid-19||A 100-member medical team from Kerala comprising doctors and critical care nurses is set to come to Mumbai to assist the Maharashtra government in its fight against the pandemic. Last week, the state had sought help from Kerala. Kerala was the first state to report Covid-19 case in the country in January, but has since managed it well with high recovery and lowest mortality rates.“An advance team has already reached SevenHills Hospital in Mumbai. Doctors without borders,” tweeted Kerala finance minister Thomas Isaac. Kerala health minister KK Shailaja said a team led by deputy superintendent of Thiruvananthapuram medical college hospital Dr SS Santhosh Kumar has reached Mumbai and others would join him in a couple of days.Last month, a team led by Kumar was rushed to north Kerala’s Kasaragod which saw a rise in cases. The team helped set up a Covid hospital, and later cases came down drastically. Kerala had also dispatched 800 medical professionals to the UAE and Saudi Arabia two weeks ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kerala-medical-team-to-help-maharashtra-battle-covid-19/story-ZGYoDhCBi8Ib1PVL7ofOsL.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Mission Begin Again’ to unlock Maha in phases||The Maharashtra government on Sunday extended its coronavirus-enforced lockdown to June 30 even as it extended more relaxations, such as allowing outdoor activities like jogging, running and cycling from June 3 and private offices to operate from June 8 in red zones (excluding containment zones).Announcing the lifting of curbs that will be rolled out in three phases, the state issued a notification — Mission Begin Again — which aims to bring the state on track to routine life amid the Covid-19 outbreak. This comes a day after the Centre announced guidelines on lockdown 5.0, billed as ‘Unlock 1’, allowing for significant relaxations.Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his Facebook live address on Sunday night, said the lifting of curbs was being done very cautiously as the state was at a turning point. “We have either reached the peak of the curve or are about to reach. There will be a downward trend starting in the next eight-15 days. We are easing it out in a phased manner, so that we will not have to withdraw relaxations like how a few countries were forced to do so. In some countries, the lockdown curbs were reimposed because of the surge, while in some others, schools had to be shut down after they were opened,” he said.Thackeray also announced that newspapers will be allowed to be delivered at doorsteps from June 7. He said dealers have been directed to ensure that adequate measures are taken for the safety of delivery boys. Even as the state rolled out its ‘Mission Begin Again’, it reported 2,487 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, taking the total to 67,655. The toll rose to 2,286 cases with 89 more deaths. The state continued to improve its recovery rate, taking it to 45% as 29,329 patients recovered from the infection till Sunday. The doubling rate in Maharashtra reached 17.5%, as against the national rate of 15.7 days, while the mortality rate dropped to 3.37%. In Mumbai, 1,244 new cases and 52 deaths were reported, taking the tally to 39,686 and toll to 1,279. According to the state’s latest notification, physical activities, including walking, running, exercising, cycling, can begin from June 3 in sports complexes, stadia, playgrounds, beaches and open spaces. Shops, market places can be open (on odd-even basis) from June 5 and private offices (up to 10 per cent of staff) can start operating from June 8. These relaxations are applicable for the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) [the areas governed by nine municipal corporations], Pune, Solapur, Aurangabad, Malegaon, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur — the 19 corporations, which have been earmarked as red zones. All the containment zones within the red zones remain excluded from the relaxations. The non-red zone areas, which include the remaining eight municipal corporations and rest of Maharashra, mostly covering the rural areas, have already been given greater relaxations. The state has not given permission to hotels and religious places to open even though they have been allowed by the Centre.Private offices in all the red zones can now operate at 10% of their strength, with the remaining staff working from home. “The offices will have to take care of transportation facilities for its employees as public transport has not been allowed in red zones,” said a government official. Government offices have been allowed to operate at 15% of their strength, up from the current permission of 5%. “We are billing it as Mission Begin Again, as it a beginning of the lifting of curbs in a phased manner. Although we have extended the lockdown till June 30, there will be graded relaxations coming in the next four weeks. Industrial and commercial activities will see greater relaxations on the need-base criterion. Few more civic corporations may see exclusion from the red zones,” said an official from the state government. All markets, market areas and shops, except malls and market complexes, have now been allowed to open on a P1-P2 basis between 9am and 5pm. Shops on one lane will be allowed to open on odd dates, while another lane will be opened on even dates. The notification, however, warned that the violation of social-distancing norms by such shops, markets will result in their closure immediately. In a veiled attack on Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders in the state, Thackeray said that Maharashtra has done a fair job in the battle against Covid-19, but “some of our own people” are targeting the government. “People who have been criticising us and demanding for the military to be called (for the implementation of lockdown norms), should first look at the figures. Our recovery rate and the infrastructure, which has been set up in the last few weeks, is better than many other states and even countries. We are ready with the health infrastructure to face the challenge and have successfully fought it so far. More than 29,000 patients have recovered and the mortality rate has dropped to 3.37%, which will drop further in the near future,” he said.Thackeray said that the state has augmented the bed capacity to 25,000 for treating infection in 2,576 hospitals, while the isolation bed capacity has been ramped up to 2.5 lakh beds. The order also clarified that cycling, jogging, running at playgrounds, beaches, society premises and open spaces is now allowed by maintaining social distancing. It has also allowed self-employed commercial activities like plumber and electricians in red zones. The notification is silent on allowing maids or househelps in housing societies, with senior officials saying that has been left to housing societies and it is not prohibited.Domestic helps are allowed to be employed in red zones, if housing societies decide it. However, they are not allowed to work in containment zones and similarly, they should not be coming from containment zones, said government officials. The state government also issued a separate notification allowing shooting of films, television shows and series on OTT platforms by maintainingnorms of the lockdown. The notification has also warned that permission will be withdrawn if lockdown norms were not followed. The producers will have to apply with Films, Theatre and Cultural Development Corporation in Mumbai and collectors in other districts. Trains, metro, inter-state and inter-district transport, educational institutions, malls, multiplexes, place of worship, political-religious-social gatherings, barbar shops, spas, saloons remain banned across the state, be it in red or non-red zones. Forty-seven of the patients who died on Sunday were above 60 years of age, while 35 were in the age group of 40 to 59 years and the remaining seven were below the age of 40 years. 56 of them had high-risk comorbidities, including diabetes, hypertension and heart ailments.The testing rate in the state is 3,585 per million, against the national average of 2,722 tests a million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mission-begin-again-to-unlock-maha-in-phases/story-s1sw8IqDPNgbx7Co8sgEIP.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||BMC gears up for more sero-surveillance in city||In a bid to ascertain the spread of the coronavirus in Mumbai, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has decided to widen the scope of sero-surveillance in the city.Sero-surveillance is done through a blood test to get an estimate of anti-body levels against vaccine preventable diseases. The surveillance can give an idea of the spread of Covid-19 in general population and immunity against it and help authorities strengthen contact-tracing and containment strategies. The survey is done by collection of blood samples from individuals in randomly selected households. The presence of antibodies in the blood is a sign of exposure to the virus. It is done after taking patients’ consent and their detailed history.BMC officials said the first round of collecting 500 samples from areas such as Dharavi, Kurla, Kandivli, Govandi etc has been completed and its test results are now awaited.“Sero-surveillance of 500 samples from areas such as Dharavi, Kurla, Kandivli and Govandi has been completed. However, the reports from the ICMR are awaited. The ICMR has informed us that more samples will be collected after the results of these 500 are out,” said Daksha Shah, deputy executive officer of BMC. According to BMC officials, the modalities of sample size, collection locations are yet to be workedout, but deliberation is going on to select samples of high-risk and low-risk contacts from all 24 wards in the city. “We are yet to work out the modalities of what could be the sample size and which areas will be included. Nothing is finalised yet. There will be a scientific method for deciding these parameters,” Shah said.Meanwhile, the case count in city touched 39,686 on Sunday. Of the total 38,442 cases reported, as of Saturday, 30,630 cases were reported in May. The number is slightly lower than the projection of 45,000 by May 31. The total number of deaths in the city stands at 1279. “We had projected around 45,000 cases earlier considering we contain the spread, the revised estimate was of around 40,000 cases by May 31,’’ said Shah. On Sunday, 38 new cases were reported in Dharavi taking the total to 1,771. Dharavi falls in G North ward which has the highest number of positive cases in the city. As of Sunday, G North ward reported 2,900 cases.The BMC’s discharge rate is 46% against national average of 42.8 %, followed by death rate at 3.2% whereas the national average is 3 %. The doubling rate of positive cases in Mumbai is 16 days, as of Saturday.The BMC is yet to decide on the manner in which the new relaxations will be implemented in the city. A BMC official said, “On Monday, there is a meeting with the municipal commissioner to decide the operating guidelines on opening up the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-gears-up-for-more-sero-surveillance-in-city/story-p0pPZymGmNrSuxzo3zu0jL.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||Scientists use AI to find drug to fight Covid||As the world races to find a cure for Covid-19, a Mumbai-based data scientist along with his team have with the help of artificial intelligence (AI) found three molecular compounds, which they claim can be synthesised and tested further to find a novel drug to fight the Covid-19 pandemic .Vikram Jha, 31, founder and chief executive officer of Pucho Technology Information Limited, along with his team has developed virtual drug molecules that can act as a potential drug for Covid-19. The team, comprising deep learning engineers Madhusudan Verma and Deepanshu Bansal, has generated three molecular structures that may help inhibit the virus’s growth. “In fact, one of the generated drugs is functionally similar to the three medicines that are approved by the US FDA (Food and Drugs Administration) as emergency drugs — Remdesivir, Umifenovir and Elbasvir,” said Jha. In a bid to come up with possible drugs to fight Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, the scientists first trained the AI model to learn the grammar of the subject language—in this case, medicinal chemistry — which led the AI to suggest possible solutions to neutralise different viruses. Following this, the super computers generated around 200 chemical structures. Of these, three were found to have drug likeness properties which can help in inhibiting the growth of Sars-CoV-2.However, considering the virus keeps mutating, it is important to find target protein that doesn’t alter much after mutation to neutralise the virus. During their research, the team found out about a critical enzyme of the virus called 3CLpro which helps for the growth of virus. If this enzyme gets inhibited, it can help to stop the growth of the virus. They used a process called docking to predict the inhibition. This is being done with the help of supercomputers to fasten the process by almost 1,000 times as the process depends on the computing power of the respective supercomputers. “We started working on it in around mid-March and it took us almost 45 days to find the lead molecules. If one had not done this by computer-aided design, it would have taken more than three years, further delaying the process,” said Jha. Now, the team is working to convert the virtual drug molecules into drugs by using active pharmaceutical ingredients as feedstock. “Then, we will run the test on cellular level as in vitro. With its success, we will go the next level— in vivo assays,” said Verma.Once the drug passes the tests and clinical trials, it can be submitted for emergency user authorisation approval to drug regulatory authorities. Verma and Bansal made the pre-print of the paper, which is not peer-reviewed yet, available online on ChemRxiv. They are in talks with two research and development labs for synthesising and testing these compounds to find the perfect drug.AI may hold the key to Covid-19AI in the healthcare industry is expected to become a whopping $36.1 billion market by the end of 2025. According to engineers across the country, AI may hold the key to solve the Covid-19 pandemic. Many pharma and IT companies – including TCS – have been involved in creating such molecules through AI. “The use of AI has considerably shortened the initial drug design process from several months to only a few days,” said Dr Gopalakrishnan Bulusu, principal scientist involved in producing 31 molecules for Covid drugs through AI. Kavi Arya, a professor at Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay’s computer science and engineering unit, said, “In Covid pandemic, AI may become critical in finding prospective drug molecules. Many AI-based apps are already helping in identifying and maintaining data of Covid patients.” He, however, refused to comment on TCS and Pucho’s molecular projects without the data in hand. In India, the government has already launched an AI-enabled smartphone application called Aarogya Setu which helps users check if they have crossed paths with patients who have tested positive for Covid-19.“The virus is spreading fast and we don’t have much time. Through the usage of AI and machine learning (ML) we can boost the process by identifying drugs having efficacy against Covid-19 faster,” said Jha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/scientists-use-ai-to-find-drug-to-fight-covid/story-lkIuHE142nalEs2s6EK0dM.html

His family must get Rs 1 crore compensation and a legal heir should get a job. The TMC must probe the circumstances that led his death,” Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/thane-municipal-employee-dies-of-covid-19-rs-1-crore-for-kin-probe-sought/story-bkfPoEHlNOoCJEB9DTVjWP.html
01-06-2020||Delhi||Two more Delhi Police officers succumb to Covid-19||Two Delhi Police officers posted in central and outer districts died of Covid-19 between Saturday and Sunday morning, taking the total number of deaths in the police force to three since May 5, when the first death of a constable was reported.Senior police officers said the two, both assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs), died while being treated for the virus at the Army Base Hospital in Delhi Cantonment. More than 500 police personnel in Delhi, including two Indian Police Service (IPS) officers, have tested positive for Covid-19 so far.The Capital has so far registered 19,844 cases of Covid-19, and 473 deaths. As many as 1,295 people tested positive for the disease on Sunday alone, the largest single-day spike in the city yet.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Sanjay Bhatia said 54-year-old Shesh Mani Pandey, posted as a fingerprints expert in the central district’s mobile crime scene inspection team, died on Saturday evening.Bhatia said Pandey, a former Army jawan who joined the Delhi Police in 2014, was tested for the virus at Lady Hardinge hospital on May 26 after he complained of fever and cough.“On May 28, the report confirmed he had been infected with the virus. Pandey was admitted to the Army Base hospital the same day. He died while being treated, on Saturday evening,” Bhatia said.Four police personnel from the mobile crime team and two of his family members have been tested and quarantined, Bhatia said.Officers said the mobile crime team’s central Delhi office has been disinfected and sanitised.“We are trying to ascertain who Pandey contracted the virus from. The visits of the crime scene investigation team over the past few days are being examined,” said a senior police officer associated with the contact tracing procedure.Pandey is survived by his wife and two sons. The family hailed from Rewa in Madhya Pradesh, and were living in west Delhi’s Naraina.In Sunday’s death, Vikram, posted at the Sultanpuri police station in outer district died of Covid-19 at the hospital, where he was admitted on May 26. He was on highway patrol duty in the police station’s jurisdiction since May 1, a statement released by the Delhi Police said.According to the statement, Vikram had tested negative in two earlier Covid-19 tests, conducted on May 11 and May 22. On May 25, he felt unwell and a doctor at Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Hospital advised him a week’s rest.“On May 26 morning, Vikram started facing difficulty in breathing at his Kirari Suleman Nagar home. He got himself admitted to the hospital and the same evening he was shifted to Army Base Hospital. In the third Covid-19 test, his report came positive. Around 11.30 am on Sunday, he died during treatment,” the police statement read.Police officers said they have started tracing Vikram’s contacts.Delhi Police chief SN Shrivastava on Sunday afternoon tweeted his condolences. “Delhi Police family mourns the loss of 2 brave police officers in our fight against Corona pandemic despite best efforts to save them. We pay homage to ASIs Vikram and Shesh Mani Pandey and may their souls rest in peace. We are committed to providing all help to their families,” he tweeted.On May 5, a 31-year-old constable posted at Bharat Nagar police station in northwest Delhi had died of Covid-19. Later, his wife and son were also tested positive.Meanwhile, five more police personnel of the Moti Nagar police station tested positive on Sunday, taking the number of Covid-19 cases in the police station to 16. Earlier, the station house officer and his operator were also tested positive. “We have planned to carry out a disinfection drive at the police station for a few days, starting Monday,” said Deepak Purohit, deputy commissioner of police (west).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/two-more-delhi-police-officers-succumb-to-covid-19/story-t0IN80wUAOJTKSUggqsolJ.html
01-06-2020||Delhi||10k Covid-19 beds to see Delhi through for 30 days: Govt||The government has earmarked 10,000 beds for patients with serious symptoms, projecting that these will see Delhi through for at least the next 30 days, given that Covid-19 cases are increasing at the rate of 5.9% a day in the Capital.For the next phase, when Delhi is closer to its peak of Covid-19 cases as predicted by the government, between July-end and mid-August, the administration will take over banquet halls, community centres, stadiums and more hotels - all of which will be in addition to the 10,000 beds, senior health department officials said on Sunday.Additionally, with cases emerging in slums and unauthorised colonies, the Delhi government is now going to increase the number of beds at Covid Care Centres to 10,000, from around 6,000 currently. This is to ensure that asymptomatic patients, or those with mild symptoms who cannot isolate themselves at home, are able to use government facilities for free, a senior official said.On Sunday, Delhi recorded its highest ever single-day spike, with 1,295 new cases, taking the total cases of infections in the city to 19,844. Of these, 10,893 are active infections.Covid-19 cases in Delhi are doubling every 12.8 days, compared to the national average of 16.8 days. At the same time, Delhi had one of the highest testing rates with 10,881 tests per million population, as against the national average of 2,675 tests per million.Government reports showed that as on Sunday, 1,870 of 4,456 beds — across government and private hospitals — were vacant.When asked whether Delhi’s health infrastructure is prepared to take the load, chief secretary Vijay Dev said: “In the last few days, we have arranged for at least 5,390 new beds in hotels, and government and private hospitals — most of which will be ready by Tuesday. The total Covid beds for serious patients will then be 10,000, which will set us off for at least the next 30 days, even if daily cases increase a bit. This will also give us time to plan for the next one month and beyond.”For the next phase (in July), when Covid-19 cases in Delhi are close to reaching their projected peak, the government is identifying banquet halls, community centres, stadiums and more hotels to be converted into extended hospitals, and Covid Health or Care centres. “In a day or two, we will issue an order for a banquet hall to be converted into an extended Covid hospital. This will be a trial, of sorts, for the coming days,” the health department official said.Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal reviewed the city administration’s bed augmentation plan on Sunday, during which he was informed that the government’s Burari hospital will be ready with 450 Covid-19 beds by June 15.Similarly, the number of beds equipped with oxygen facilities will be increased from the current 3,233 to 5,513 by June 15. By June 2, there will be 90 additional ICU beds taking the total to 521 and the number of ventilators will be increased to 433 from 343, government reports accessed by HT revealed.Besides, the Centre on Sunday told the Delhi government that hospitals under the railways have earmarked 100 beds for the state and that the Army Base hospital has kept 70 beds aside.Three dedicated Covid-19 hospitals - GTB hospital (1,500 beds), Satyavadi Raja Harish Chandra hospital in Narela (200 beds) and Deep Chand Bandhu hospital in Ashok Vihar (200 beds) - will be ready by June 2. Another 1,170 beds are being readied in five hotels in Delhi, which government officials said was the first-ever initiative in India where hotels are being turned into “extended Covid hospitals”.A senior government official said that around 1,700 beds — against the target of 2,000 — have been confirmed by a majority of the 117 private hospitals that were asked to reserve 20% of their total beds for Covid-19 patients. With this, the government had 9,846 beds in place, as of Sunday. The remaining 154 beds will be covered once more private hospitals from the private hospital pool send their confirmations, the official added.Additional chief secretary (home), Satya Gopal, who is also the Delhi government’s nodal officer for Covid-19 management, said: “Of the total Covid-19 cases in Delhi, 55% are asymptomatic, who as per Centre’s guidelines should be under home quarantine. So, if we take 45% (around 4,900 cases) of the 10,893 active cases in Delhi, only 2,586 have required hospitalisation as they are serious cases. Patients with mild and moderate symptoms are kept in Covid Health Centre, Covid Care Centres and some are even in home quarantine,” he said. Government reports showed that as on Sunday, only 624 beds — of a total of at least 6,000— were occupied in Care Centres. Similarly, 158 patients were admitted in Health Centres, which have a capacity of 400 beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10k-covid-beds-to-see-delhi-through-for-30-days-govt/story-9631ax97SDkle1bpXtagLK.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||Despite Bombay HC’s order, licence for mining in Maharashtra’s green zone renewed: RTI||The Kolhapur regional office of the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has renewed an iron ore mining licence at Kalne village in the contentious Dodamarg-Sawantwadi belt, a Right to Information (RTI) Act response received by environmental group Vanashakti has revealed.The Bombay high court (HC) in 2013, based on 2011 petition by Awaaz Foundation, had directed the Union environment ministry and state government to ensure that the corridor is protected as an ecologically-sensitive area (ESA), where mining and red-category industries are prohibited and need to be phased out. The HC had reiterated its order in 2018, based on Vanashakti’s petition in 2016, declaring the entire belt as a ‘no tree-felling zone’. Based on the HC order, the forest department had recently approved a study worth ₹83 lakh, directing the Wildlife Institute of India, Dehradun, to assess the exact boundaries of the ESA and analyse the presence of tiger and elephant movements.According to the RTI response, MPCB has issued the consent to renew operations to handle 7.5 lakh metric tonnes of iron ore for a year till March 31, 2021, across the 32.25-hectare (ha) area at Kalne, falling in Dodamarg taluka of Sindhudurg district.The area forms a part of the corridor that connects the Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary in Kolhapur to Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka.Based on the RTI response, Vanashakti collated satellite images, accessed photographs of the site and filed a complaint on Saturday with various state bodies, including the environment department, urging them to revoke the permissions given, as it risks the safety of the corridor, which is home to a large biodiversity.“The entire 32.2-ha green cover has been destroyed due to mining operations. The change in topography shows the extent of destruction to this crucial wildlife corridor caused by the mining body, with the blessing of MPCB. Satellite imagery shows tree felling at the Kalne mine area, even as MPCB’s renewal for mining operations is in defiance of the prohibitory order imposed by the HC,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti.MPCB said the mining body had begun operations in 2009 after acquiring environment clearance, following which the first license to operate was issued.“This was an existing mine before the petition in the HC. Renewal consent was approved by the previous regional officer as there is no stay on existing industries. However, following the moratorium issued for Dodamarg taluka based on the HC directive, no new red-category units or project expansions have been approved by us,” said Ravindra Andhale, regional officer (Kolhapur), MPCBA senior officer from the state forest department said, “Prohibited activities at any area proposed as an ESA includes complete ban on mining, quarrying and sand mining. The phasing out of existing mines within five years of ESA proposal, and all other red category industries including thermal power plants are to be banned.”Though the entire Dodamarg taluka was left out of the Western Ghats draft ESA, forest minister Sanjay Rathod said the state was examining the details of the HC order and the matter was yet to be considered by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray.Biodiversity at stakeAs per petitions submitted before the HC, the corridor is home to tigers, leopards, elephants, sloth bears, civets, pangolins, several resident and migratory bird species, and the Indian giant squirrel, which is Maharashtra’s state animal. The forest department confirmed that over the past five years, transient movement of around 25 tigers has been observed at the corridor, while an elephant family of five reside there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-hc-s-order-licence-for-mining-in-green-zone-renewed-rti/story-22UBSKqEQyAwZKwhoFpZRM.html
01-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt seeks immediate financial aid of Rs 5,000 crore from Centre to pay salaries||The Delhi government has sought immediate assistance of Rs 5,000 crore from the Centre to pay salaries to its employees because revenues dried up during the lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Sunday.Sisodia, who also holds the finance portfolio, said he has written to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for help and added that the Delhi government has not received money sanctioned to states under the Disaster Relief Fund. According to Sisodia, Delhi’s tax revenue has declined by 78% since the national lockdown came into force on March 25. “At this juncture, paying salaries to government employees is our biggest concern. They include doctors, healthcare workers, teachers, etc, who have been leading the fight against the virus. We immediately need Rs. 5,000 crore to pay their salary,” Sisodia said in a video press briefing.He added “Recently, the Union finance ministry announced a relief package (of Rs 20 lakh crore) but there is nothing in it for Delhi... Other states have received financial assistance from the Disaster Relief Fund, but the Delhi government has not received any such aid yet... So, I have written to the Union finance minister to grant a one-time relief package of Rs 5,000 crore for Delhi.”The letter, Sisodia’s office said, was sent to the Union minister’s office on May 26.“Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, there is a valid need for immediate help from the Centre. The one-time grant of Rs 5,000 crore will, thereby, help Delhi tide over the immediate crisis. This will also facilitate the Delhi government in releasing the grants to the (three) municipal corporations in the city which largely depend on the city government to pay salary,” said Sisodia.The Delhi government’s expenditure towards salaries of its employees alone is around Rs 3,500 crore per month, said a senior official in Delhi government’s finance department, requesting anonymity. The official said that for now, the government was primarily spending on two things – salaries and Covid-19 related expenses ranging from healthcare-related spending to arranging food and shelter for the poor.All government projects that demand capital expenditure have been halted, the official said.“The Centre should be granting funds to states, especially those with high Covid caseloads,” Jayati Ghosh, a professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University, said. “Most states have been seeking funds since the lockdown was imposed. Most states have recorded around 90% drop in revenue and they are in a helpless state. The need immediate funds to pay salaries, especially those who are leading the fight against Covid – from doctors and nurses to teachers and anganwadi workers.” In the previous financial year, the Delhi government earned around Rs 7,799 crore of revenue in the months of April and May, another senior government official said on condition of anonymity. In the same months this financial year, the Delhi government has only collected Rs 1,735 crore, which includes Rs 500 crore in Goods and Services Tax (GST).In April, the government received revenue of around Rs 420 crore. May was relatively better in terms of revenue – the collection was recorded at around 1,315 crore – after the city witnessed a phased revival of business and commerce from May 4, and after further lockdown relaxations on May 17.In May, the major sources of revenue for the government was a “special corona fee” levied at 70% on the maximum retail price (MRP) of alcohol, other than the usual excise element, and revision of value added tax (VAT) to 30% on both petrol and diesel from the earlier rates of 27% and 16.75% respectively, said the official. “The government has earned more than Rs 250 crore through special corona fee alone,” the official said.The Union finance ministry spokesperson did not respond to an email query specific to Delhi and about the city government’s request for the financial aid.A finance ministry official, who requested anonymity, said, “The Union government is continuously providing revenues due to the states despite a sharp decline in revenues. Devolution of taxes are happening as per the budget estimate (BE) even though actual revenue shows unprecedented decline from the BE. Last week, the Centre issued sanction orders worth Rs 46,038.70 crore for the May instalment of devolution of states’ share in central taxes and duties.”“Besides, the union government has provided more fiscal space to them as per their demand. On May 17, the Union government acceded to the request of states and increased their borrowing limits from 3% to 5%,{of state gross domestic product} for 2020-21 only in the light of the unprecedented situation due to Covid-19, which will give them extra resources of Rs 4.28 lakh crore. States should also mobilise these resources,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-seeks-immediate-financial-aid-of-rs5-000-crore-from-centre-to-pay-salaries/story-r7klW67Qf34VkzeTWjfcnI.html

While the weather bureau’s national bulletin on Sunday issued a ‘red alert’ for the entire Konkan coast for June 3 and 4, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) Mumbai on Sunday issued orange alert (be prepared for heavy to very heavy rain) for Mumbai and Thane, and a red alert (take action as there will be extremely heavy rain) for Palghar district for June 3 and 4. Rain and thundershowers (no alert) have been predicted for all three districts for Monday and Tuesday, according to IMD Mumbai’s district rainfall forecast.Several areas in south Konkan (Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg) reported thundershowers on Sunday, while rain forecast has also been issued for central Maharashtra and Marathwada.IMD issued a bulletin - pre-cyclone watch for south Gujarat and north Maharashtra coast - on Sunday that said a low-pressure area (weather system) over southeast and adjoining eastcentral Arabian Sea is very likely to concentrate into a weather depression by Monday.“The system is likely to intensify further by Tuesday into a cyclonic storm and recurve northeastwards and reach closer to north Maharashtra, including Mumbai and surrounding areas, as well as south Gujarat coast, by Wednesday (June 3) morning,” said Sunita Devi, in-charge of cyclones at IMD.Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD, said, “Isolated areas across Mumbai, Thane, Palghar and Raigad can expect very heavy rain with extremely heavy rain in some areas during this period, along with high speed winds ranging from 90-100 km/h gusting to maximum 110 km/h on June 3 and 4.”The landfall of the cyclone is yet to be declared by IMD. “We will give landfall point of the cyclone after the weather system intensifies into a depression. All necessary warnings have already been communicated to the Maharashtra and Gujarat governments,” said Mohapatra.Warnings for the Maharashtra fishing community not to venture into sea have been in place since last Thursday. IMD said sea conditions are likely to be rough to very rough over till Thursday.Meanwhile, the suburbs recorded its highest day temperature of the season so far on Sunday at 35.8 degrees Celsius, 2.2 degrees above normal. It was 35.7 degrees Celsius on Saturday. South Mumbai recorded 35.7 degrees Celsius, 1.8 degrees above normal on Sunday. Moisture levels were high as south Mumbai recorded 84% humidity during the day and 72% during the evening while the suburbs recorded 69% and 54% during the day and evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclonic-storm-nisarga-to-develop-in-arabian-sea-imd-issues-heavy-rain-alert/story-vTB2usHblEInma46Ht4tAM.html
01-06-2020||Delhi||Concerns raised over Delhi University’s online admission process||As Delhi University gears up to move its entire admission process online, several concerns have been raised over the process, including the verification of documents, over-centralisation of processes and the end of student-teacher counselling.Last week, the university shared a tentative schedule of the admission process with the standing committee of the academic council, along with a list of agenda items. The agenda items included “online verification of the documents to approve provisional admission” and “physical verification of the original documents of the applicants once the session commences.”Several teachers and principals have raised questions about the move, stating that it leaves room for fraudulent admissions and makes the entire admission process “impersonal.” The stakeholders point towards the challenges of verifying documents like mark sheets, birth certificates, and caste and income certificates online.Former academic council member Pankaj Garg, who teaches at Rajdhani College and has been on the college’s admission committee, said, “Generally after Class 12, several students are confused about what to do. That can only be resolved through direct interaction and counselling by teachers. The interpersonal interaction among parents, teachers and students will end because of this online process. Till now, students would visit the college for admission, take a look at the various facilities, and even talk to teachers of the admission committee for counselling.”Following the 2018 controversy over former Delhi University Students’ Union president Ankiv Baisoya, who had been charged with producing fake degrees and mark sheets for admission, the varsity had asked colleges to take steps towards a forensic examination of degrees and mark sheets by experts.A principal of a south Delhi DU college, requesting anonymity, said, “One year, the varsity asks us to arrange for forensic experts and check the documents of all students. Just the next year, it calls for provisional admission without even the physical verification of mark sheets. If these weren’t necessary, why the push for forensic examination of the documents last year?”The principal added that checking documents once colleges reopen will lead to a “chaotic” situation. “Under the previous system, we would finish these processes earlier. Now, they will spill over to the academic session. We won’t even know if students cancel their admission and go to other colleges.”Dean (Admissions), DU, Shobha Bagai said it was still too early to comment on this process since all statutory bodies are yet to be consulted. “As far as counselling is concerned, we are mentoring volunteers for the online counselling of prospective applicants. Under the present situation, it won’t be appropriate to ask students to travel from other states and visit different colleges with different cutoffs. Such physical interaction won’t be feasible or safe for students amid this pandemic,” she said.Meanwhile, a group of the varsity’s executive and academic council members has also written to the vice-chancellor regarding the online open book examination mode, pointing out the drawbacks of the system. “The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology says 12,000 village panchayats are yet to be covered by the Common Service Centre,” the members wrote. This was in reference to DU’s proposal of tying up with government CSC’s to ensure students have access to the Internet and devices to appear for their papers. “A village Pradhan in Sonepat district told us that there was no CSC in his village. During a telephonic survey of two panchayats of Madhubani District in Bihar, we found that only one of them has a CSC, but that too functions infrequently with no proper sitting arrangement. In Brahmauli Kunda village of Pratapgarh district of UP, CSC is 8 to 10 KMs away from that village [sic],” the teachers’ group Academics for Action and Development wrote, stating that students could not depend upon CSC infrastructure for exams. Despite calls and messages, DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi did not respond to requests for comments on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/concerns-over-online-du-admissions/story-FG79mHbsW9dwRNQQetpviK.html

01-06-2020||Delhi||Over 9 lakh govt school students in Delhi benefitted from digital learning during lockdown, says Manish Sisodia||The five digital learning interventions — that had been started by the Delhi government over the past two months to help children continue learning even during the lockdown — concluded on Sunday, with deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia saying that more than nine lakh students of Delhi government schools had benefitted from the initiative.The five programmes initiated by the Delhi government included live online classes for students of class 12, English and personality development for Class 10 and 12 students, online mathematics for Class 9 students, digital entrepreneurship mindset classes for students of classes 9 to 12, text and interactive voice response (IVR) enabled activity classes for classes KG to 8 through parents. In addition to these, 15 sessions of happiness classes were also conducted online, which were open to all and were attended by families.On Sunday, Sisodia conducted a review meeting with parents, teachers, and students in the presence of senior education department officials. “I am glad to see that we could minimise academic damage due to loss of learning time, thanks to the exemplary efforts of our teachers, parents and children who embraced this new way of learning,” he said. Director of Education Binay Bhushan said the department plans to track the students on a weekly basis, till they join schools completely.Principal advisor to director education, Shailendra Sharma, said the online classes for Class 12 students were attended by over 1,40,000 students. Launched in partnership with Career Launcher on April 6, the maximum attendance recorded was for English classes with 60,500 students logging in. “Earlier in our regular classes, we did not have the option to go back to topics already covered, but now in online classes, these topics are recorded and can be watched over and over again,” said Diya Jain, a student of a government school in Gandhi Nagar during the review meeting with Sisodia.Around 1,75,000 students of Class 9 accessed the Mathematics lessons, which were assisted by 1,015 teachers oriented by Khan Academy, the government said. The 90-minute class spread over three days a week for a month and covered seven topics on foundational maths for a new batch and 4 topics of practice for the old batch.The government’s flagship entrepreneurship classes also continued during the lockdown and around 45,000 students participated in the digital activities. “Around 25 IVR based activities and 52 inputs to parents were shared with nearly 570,000 students. These activities ranged from building reading, writing and numeracy skills to self-reflection, critical thinking and responding to lockdown situation,” the government said in a statement.During the 30 sessions of the English and personality development classes conducted by the Delhi government in partnership with British Council and MacMillian Education, maximum attendance stood at 83,545.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/over-9-lakh-govt-school-students-continued-their-learning-digitally-during-lockdown-says-manish-sisodia/story-LdpllHFJ0eZ60HJlGV6V7O.html
01-06-2020||Delhi||Man who ran ‘robbery training school’ held after shootout||A 22-year-old man who ran a “robbery training school” from his house in outer Delhi’s Bawana was arrested after an encounter with the police on Sunday. The police said the suspect, Manish, started the “school” in his house in the area’s JJ Colony after being bailed from prison in a snatching case earlier this year.“He has 17 known snatching cases registered against him. After his release from jail in February he decided he would not be directly involved in robberies and would instead make money by training young snatchers and robbers, and from taking a cut on their earnings,” said Gaurav Sharma, deputy commissioner of police (outer-north). So, Manish allegedly scouted for youngsters — minors and adults — who were keen to enter the trade. “He would bring them to his house in Bawana’s JJ Colony and train them to identity targets like pedestrians and cyclists and snatch from them without getting caught. He also trained them on what neighbourhoods to choose and getaway routes strategically,” Sharma said. Sharma said Manish would also train them on how to cover their faces and avoid having any signs on themselves and their motorcycles that could lead to them being identified. “He would also provide them motorcycles to carry out the robberies and take care of their legal needs in case anyone got caught,” the officer said. In return, his apprentices would pay him a share of their earnings. Another investigator not authorised to speak to the media said Manish charged between 20% and 50% as commission on the after-sale value of the robbed items. It remained unclear how many robberies were allegedly carried out by Manish’s trainees, but the police said they were alerted of the presence of Manish’s school by one of his trainees, Kuldeep, who was arrested on May 24 for a snatching in Bawana.“In the early hours of Friday, on the basis of a tip-off, we set up a trap in Bawana. When Manish and his two associates driving a van were signalled to stop, they rammed the police barricades and tried to get away,” Sharma said. Once intercepted, Manish allegedly fired at the police team, who fired back in response. No one was hurt in the brief exchange. “While we caught Manish’s associates, Hazibul Sheikh and a minor, Manish ran down a drain to escape. But he hurt his foot in the process, and we caught him,” said the other investigator. The police went on to recover two guns and 20 allegedly stolen mobile phones from the gang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-who-ran-robbery-training-school-held-after-shootout/story-NKNGeX9w1ARRKwoDkmgGNI.html
01-06-2020||Chandigarh||For class of 2020, all higher study plans put on the back-burner because of Covid-19||It has not been easy for Natasha Sharma, a Class-12 student. Preparing for admission to an undergraduate course at a university in the United States (US), she’s worried about the impact of the Covid-19 lockdown on the class of 2020 .“If not a year, this is a setback for at least the next six months. There is no clarity on the academic calendar to be followed,” says Sharma. “I had planned everything meticulously. If not the US, then I would have applied for Indian universities. Everything is so chaotic now.”With two exams still pending for the board exams, she feels “two years of planning for studies abroad have gone waste.”The student community moving to colleges and universities has been hit hard by the pandemic, with no clarity on competitive exams and admission schedules to institutes of higher education.Most of them are unsure of future plans with the postponement of the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE) to engineering and architecture colleges, National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET) to medical colleges and Common Law Admission Test (CLAT) to law institutes.Popular institutes such as Delhi and Panjab universities have also postponed admissions.The home ministry’s fresh guidelines for lockdown 5.0 to reopen schools and colleges after consultations with states and union territories in July has added to the confusion.“Students sitting at home are battling with anxiety as they are uncertain about what the future holds for them. Parents are concerned about the pending exams, college admissions and safety of their children,” says Sharma’s father Vishnu Sharma. Changing education destinations Sidharth Chopra, founder of Samarthya, an organisation working with parents of students in government schools, empowering them to have a voice in how schools function and improve, says: “The months of lockdown will impact how the students choose their education destination. Many of come to study in Chandigarh from the neighbouring states of Punjab, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. I am expecting that we might see a shift in this trend.”Seconding the thought, GS Bakshi, administrator of Kabir High School in the city says , “Parents might want to send their wards to places nearby within a two to four hour distance. At this moment, however, many of them might not want to send their children abroad or to distant places.”About his daughter, Bakshi says she has changed plans to enrol in a university abroad and is thinking of joining a six-month online class at home and apply again next year.No concrete plan to reopen institutes Even though the fresh MHA guidelines say that consultations for reopening of colleges and universities will start in July, this does not mean that residential colleges like ours will reopen anytime soon,” says Dheeraj Sanghi, director, Punjab Engineering College.“For the semester other than incoming and outgoing classes, we are hopeful that we will resume classes online so they won’t be affected. However, the situation will be severely impacted if the JEE is not held on July 18 and is delayed. As of now the expected timing of incoming batch is October 2020,” he adds.Situation more complicated for government institutesBecause of greater autonomy, private colleges/universities might not wait for the Central Board of Secondary Education results and start admissions to keep up with the schedule, says Chopra. “However, the government institutions have a rulebook to follow. Moreover, they are also prone to litigations, so that can further affect the academic year,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/for-class-of-2020-all-higher-study-plans-put-on-the-back-burner-because-of-covid-19/story-J6aYgWJJkjND2nCH1gmC1K.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai then and now: City’s encounter with epidemics||Disturbing scenes of migrants leaving the city in large numbers, creation of makeshift hospitals to accommodate hundreds of patients, and door-to-door testing in high-density areas have a sense of déjà vu, given that Mumbai has faced its fair share of epidemics in the past.In a pictorial presentation on Saturday, organised by the Mumbai-based Khaki Lab, Manjiri Kamat, history professor and associate dean, faculty of humanities, University of Mumbai, talked about the bubonic plague, Spanish flu, cholera and smallpox epidemics that caused devastation in the city.“Much like today, several people left the city in huge numbers after the outbreak of the bubonic plague of 1896 in Bombay. The city was caught unawares and there was no cure for it then,” said Kamat. The city’s mortality rate was very high. It is said to have originated in Hong Kong from where it spread via trade ships to Bombay.The then municipal corporation with police teams conducted door-to-door testing in high-density areas. The outbreak resulted in the formation of the Bombay City Improvement Trust to create affordable housing and improve east-west connectivity in the city.Following an international conference on sanitation in 1866, held in Istanbul, the then British government in India reportedly made quarantining more rigorous and cancelled several pilgrimages to contain the spread of diseases like cholera and smallpox. In 1892, the Bombay Compulsory Vaccination Act was introduced to contain the spread of smallpox.“In her essay on the outbreak of the Spanish flu or influenza pandemic of 1918, Dr Mridula Ramanna states that space was made available at Sir JJ Hospital, Gokuldas Tejpal (GT) Hospital, and the Infectious Diseases Hospital (Kasturba Gandhi Hospital), and the government encouraged isolation of infected patients,” Kamat said. In her talk, she described how many institutions like the Prince of Wales Museum (Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Vastu Sangrahalaya) and the Royal Institute of Science in Fort were converted into makeshift arrangements to accommodate patients and soldiers of the First World War. “Looking at history, we are in a better position now to handle a crisis than we were ever before, thanks to technology. We must learn from history and be well-prepared for the future,” said Bharat Gothoskar, founder of Khaki Lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-then-and-now-city-s-encounter-with-epidemics/story-4dluDD7spOr3Ti57VSdDLI.html
01-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Beopar Mandal demands shop timings be relaxed||As the Centre’s instructions to shorten curfew hours from 9pm to 5am will come into effect from Monday, the Chandigarh Beopar Mandal (CBM) has written to the administration, demanding that they take a cue from this and relax working hours for shopkeepers.Charanjiv Singh, CBM chairman said, “When shops were allowed to reopen in the beginning of May, the temperatures were relatively lower. But now that temperatures going above 40 °C has become normal, the Chandigarh administration must ensure that shop timings are further extended as people will stay home in the afternoons and only come out in the evenings.”He added that since curfew will be imposed from 9pm onwards, the shops should be allowed to open till 8pm, instead of current 7pm. Singh added that since there was some confusion regarding the opening of shops on Sunday, he asked the administration to allow shopkeepers to open their shops on Sunday if they wish and issue an order for the same.CBM president Anil Vohra added that letters had been sent to all officials, including UT adviser Manoj Parida, UT deputy commissioner (DC) Mandip Singh Brar and municipal commissioner KK Yadav. “We have been assured that the issue will be discussed in the war room briefing held by UT administrator VPS Badnore on Monday,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-beopar-mandal-demands-shop-timings-be-relaxed/story-LPOtenJ80bPp58vz4s1xKP.html
01-06-2020||Mumbai||Island lockdown: Stuck in Philippines, duo returns to Mumbai after 2 months||A three-month planned sabbatical, which was meant to be used for a multi-continent trip for two Mumbai women, turned into an experience of a lifetime after they ended up spending almost two months stranded in a country under lockdown. Andheri residents Mitalee Chandwani, 33, and Aditi Khosla, 33, spent 53 days on an island of the Philippines and another few days in the capital of Manila before they could finally board a flight back to Mumbai.“Our original plan was to chill on the beaches of the Philippines for three weeks, then hop on a flight to Italy where we were supposed to volunteer on a farm for two weeks and end the trip in Germany. However, Manila went into lockdown a day after we reached the city and with air travel restricted, we chose to move to an island to ensure social distancing,” said Chandwani. She and Khosla both work in the experiential marketing industry.While Chandwani was already in Indonesia since February 26, Khosla flew from Mumbai to Manila on March 12. “That evening we heard that Manila was going into a one-month lockdown within a day. Since we knew there were air travel restrictions and too many tourists were stranded in Manila, we decided to extend our visas and move to the island of Palawan, knowing that there would be fewer people there,” said Khosla.On reaching Puerto Princesa after a 24-hour journey by ship, Chandwani started showing Covid-19 symptoms. “We immediately found a hospital in the port city and managed to get a basic test done after a few hours of waiting. Only once the test results came back negative did we head to Palawan,” said Chandwani.The first few days on the island went well, but things changed as the Covid-19 situation around the world became graver by the day. “One by one everyone started leaving the island as their respective countries sent sweeper flights to rescue them. We stayed in touch with the Indian embassy and the local tourism board daily, seeking clarity on our return status,” said Khosla.While they got their first chance to come back to mainland Manila on March 23, the women turned it down knowing that entry to India was restricted due to the lockdown. Instead, the duo chose to continue living on the island even as all the other tourists left.“We spent 53 days in Palawan because we didn’t want to be restricted to a hotel room in Manila for weeks together. At least on the island, we had access to the beach,” said Chandwani.As the only Indian tourists left on the island by the end of March, the women quickly started adapting. “We would spend the morning making calls to the embassy and local authorities, and then finish whatever reading and writing we could as there was no internet on the island. We even used the resort’s kitchen and taught the staff how to make naans,” said Chandwani.While on the island, the women also met with an accident while riding a bike. “There was no medical facility on the island and we had to take a boat to another island to get a tetanus shot, which was also not available. By this time we were getting more anxious to return home,” said Khosla.Finally, on May 2, a ship was arranged to take the last Indian tourists off the island. “Once we were in Manila, we received emails from the Indian embassy and on May 10, six days after reaching Manila, we boarded a flight for Mumbai operated as part of the Vande Bharat mission,” said Chandwani.Once in Mumbai, both the women were quarantined at a hotel for 14 days before being allowed to return home. “I had left home on February 26 and got back only on May 25. The three-month sabbatical did not go as planned but we couldn’t be happier to be back home with our families,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/island-lockdown-stuck-in-philippines-duo-returns-to-mumbai-after-2-months/story-qup0sJYuFfeDEnZ35usS0K.html
01-06-2020||Noida||Man, friend, booked for rape and criminal intimidation||A 30-year-old woman tweeted that she was raped by a person on the pretext of marriage in Greater Noida West, which prompted police to take action on Sunday. Based on the complaint, the cops registered an FIR against Yashpal Yadav and his accomplice Rahul Yadav, residents of Bisrakh. The suspects are absconding.The woman, a resident of Noida Sector 21, said that in March 2019, she had come in contact with Yashpal through social media. “He befriended me and took me for dinner to a restaurant. He had physical relations with me on pretext of marriage, several times,” she said in the complaint.The woman said she became pregnant and later aborted the child under pressure from the suspect. “Later, I came to know that the suspect was married and had two children. When I asked him why he hid the matter, he told me keep quiet or that he would leak some objectionable videos captured on his mobile phone,” the woman said. The victim said that later Yashpal’s friend Rahul also started threatening her. R K Singh, Station House Officer, Sector 20 police station, said that the woman and Yashpal had been living-in since March 2019. “The woman said that Yashpal had promised to marry her. Recently their relations turned sour and they separated,” he said. “Based on the complaint, we have registered a case against the two persons under section 376 (rape) and section 506 (criminal intimidation) of IPC. A police team conducted a search at their residences and found them absconding. The suspects will be arrested soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/man-friend-booked-for-rape-and-criminal-intimidation/story-PajkLb2bpGjuLwVX0YzIRK.html

The operation was conducted by the army from June 1 to 8, 1984 to flush out armed militants from the Golden Temple premises and the gurdwara itself was stormed on the night of June 6, 1984 to restore its sanctity. The police have deputed additional 1,000 police personnel in the city to avoid any untoward incident. Besides, the police have also intensified patrolling in the city.

01-06-2020||Noida||Containment zone rules for societies changed; shops allowed to open from 9am to 9pm||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration on Sunday announced more relaxations for the fifth phase of the lockdown. Now, the shops in the district can remain open from 9am to 9pm, although odd-even system will continue, officials said. Besides, the district administration has also changed the containment zone rules for the group housing societies, a move that will give relief to the residents in Noida and Greater Noida. It has also opened parks for visitors with some riders. The district magistrate’s order comes after the Uttar Pradesh government on Sunday issued new guidelines that will come into effect from June 1As per the new guidelines, if there is one or more active positive cases on a floor of a multi-storey tower, then only that particular tower will be declared a containment zone and not the entire housing society. And if there is one or more than one case in more than one towers in a housing society, then all these towers in question will be in containment zones and all common facilities that include swimming pool, club, park and banquet halls will be sealed to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection. However, containment rules for ‘mohalla’ or clusters will remain unchanged, the guidelines said.The UP government has revised rules after the a group of residents demanded from the government to make changes in the rules. Recently, Greater Noida West’s Ecovillage I society residents had also protested against old rules because all 61 towers were part of containment zone after one family in a tower was found positive. Apartment owners have welcomed the new containment rules for group housing societies.“This step will ease out stress of high-rise dwellers. New definition of containment zone is indeed going to benefit a large segment of people. The new guidelines strike a balance between the health, convenience and ease in streamlining residents’ professional requirements,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Association (NOFAA), a flat owners’ group.The district has 51 category I containment zones, while 31 containment zones fall into category II as defined by the UP government. “We will deal with the containment zones as per the new guidelines of the state government. Residents’ demands with regard to containment zones for towers have been looked into. And now only a tower will be made a containment zone with one or more positive cases are found. And more than one towers will be part of containment zone if one or more cases are found in these towers in question in a society,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.Meanwhile, the district administration said that the restrictions on movement of traffic between Noida and Delhi will continue till further orders. The Noida-Delhi borders will continue to be ‘sealed’, said Alok Singh, GB Nagar police commissioner, on Sunday. “We are waiting for reports from the health department for evaluation. As of now, it will remain sealed till further decision is taken on it,” said Singh.Regarding relaxing the odd-even formula of opening of shops in the markets, the district magistrate said, “We are discussing all issues with stakeholders and soon issue guidelines on the same. We have only decided on timings of shops after discussions with traders.”Shops in non-containment zones will be opened from 9am to 9pm, the officials said.Sushil Kumar Jain, president of Sector 18 market association, said, “We wanted relaxation in timings, which has been accepted. Apart from this, we expect that inter-state transport facilities will be started so that our staff can travel easily to work.” The district officials said that all government offices are allowed to resume operations with 100% attendance. However, the departments can change the shift timings of employees, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-containment-zone-rules-for-societies-changed-shops-allowed-to-open-from-9am-to-9pm/story-rQTWxVCjDK7Y8d1bgmjgrO.html

01-06-2020||Chandigarh||Second wettest May since 1971 as downpour cools Chandigarh||About 120.5 mm rain, including a heavy 50mm downpour in just a span of one-and-a-half-hours hours on Sunday evening made this the second wettest May since 1951 (the year from which weather records were maintained in India) and the wettest since 1971 when 130.7mm rain was recorded, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) has said.Temperatures dipped from Saturday’s 32.8 degrees (maximum) and 24.4 degrees (minimum) to 31.9 degrees (maximum) and 22.3 degrees (minimum) on Sunday.Even 50mm rain in one day on the last day of the month, classified as ‘rather heavy rain’ by IMD, was the highest ever recorded for this month since 2014 when 57.1mm of rain was recorded on May 4. Rainfall of 64.5mm onwards is categorised as heavy rain.‘Freak weather occurrence’Calling this a freak weather occurrence, the second this month after 31.2mm rain was recorded on May 10, IMD Chandigarh director Surender Paul said, “This May has been exceptionally rainy because of the confluence of low level easterly winds with strong western disturbances. Usually in May, only western disturbances are present in the city, but the confluence of low level winds coming in from the Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal has led to excessive rain this year.”Apart from the city, Ambala and Narnaul too had rain while the rest of the region had short spells in some areas. “Topographically also, Chandigarh is at the foothills of the Himalayas, due to this more rain was recorded in Chandigarh and Ambala, while little to no rain occurred in the rest of the region,” Paul explained.Since the rain clouds came in from the western side of the city, the Sector 39 IMD observatory recorded 50mm rain, while the airport observatory which is just a few kilometres away recorded only trace rainfall. “It was highly localised and the concentration of clouds was towards the west,” said Paul.Light rain forecast for MondayThe western disturbance the region is on its way out, Paul said, adding, “Chances of light to moderate rain will continue on Monday, but rain is unlikely from Tuesday onwards. The sky will remain cloudy for a few days and the maximum temperature will start to rise, with a dry spell pushing up temperatures to 40 degrees Celsius.”For the next three days maximum temperature will range between 33 degrees and 35 degrees and the minimum temperature between 23 degrees and 24 degrees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/second-wettest-may-since-1971-as-downpour-cools-chandigarh/story-e2SVoZdldP2MoNGEKq7GfL.html
01-06-2020||Chandigarh||Despite ICMR’s advisory, Chandigarh administration has no plans for antibody testing||Even though the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Saturday advised all states and union territories to start conducting sero-survey, a test of the blood serum, to check the levels of exposure to the coronavirus using antibody testing method, the Chandigarh administration has no plans to follow through. Earlier, a report by experts on the outbreak of Covid-19 in Bapu Dham Colony had also suggested a similar exercise after seeking permission from ICMR. The recommendation has not been implemented so far.Besides testing individuals in containment zones like Bapu Dham, ICMR had advised conducting a survey of high-risk or vulnerable populations (health-care workers, frontline workers, immune-compromised individuals, security staff, prisoners) to know who was infected in the past and has now recovered.The Bapu Dham containment zone has recorded more than 220 infections accounting for most of the total cases in the UT. The authorities here have been utilising real time reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) method of testing. Mostly high-risk individuals, contacts of the positive persons and patients with symptoms have been tested.In this type of test, the blood samples are analysed for antibodies using the Elisa method, which is an enzyme-based laboratory test that detects and quantifies antibodies in blood that will determine a past infection due to the virus.Director health services, UT, Dr G Dewan said they were awaiting guidelines from the ministry of health and family welfare.When contacted, health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said, “We do not have kits and such exercises can only be undertaken after we receive the required material from ICMR,” adding that they would like to follow what bigger states were doing in this regard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-icmr-s-advisory-chandigarh-administration-has-no-plans-for-antibody-testing/story-wrqgFZIvtOLvTJ4I7buybI.html

01-06-2020||Chandigarh||Rail overbridge in Ludhiana develops cracks a week after it opens||The railway overbridge connecting Sherpur Chowk with Oswal Cancer Hospital Chowk on National Highway 44 (previously known as NH-I) has developed cracks barely a week after its inauguration. Confirming that cracks had appeared close to the retaining walls of the bridge, Yogesh Chandra, project director NH-44, said the construction company was carrying out repairs and had been asked to explain the damage.The cracks were spotted on Sunday morning by commuters and the traffic police diverted vehicles from the spot to prevent further damage.Construction workers reached the spot to start repairs after national highway authorities were informed. One of the men working at the site who did not wish to be named said the cracks could have been caused by seepage leading to soil erosion of reinforced earth retaining wall.Deputy commissioner Pradeep Agrawal had inaugurated the flyover on May 25.The three flyover projects in the city – Basti Jodhewal, Sherpur Chowk and the one near Mohan Dai Oswal Cancer hospital – took over 10 years to be completed. Work on the railway overbridge, which commenced in September 9, 2009, and was to be completed by November, 2011, halted in 2010 due to design issues between the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) and the construction company. It restarted last year after Congress leaders, including member of Parliament (MP) Ravneet Singh Bittu, cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, mayor Balkar Sandhu, members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) Sanjay Talwar, Surinder Dawar and others staged a two-day protest at the Laddowal toll plaza in March, ahead of the Lok Sabha elections.The projects were to be completed by March 31, 2020, but work was delayed due to the nationwide lockdown. The Basti Jodhewal bridge was opened for traffic in November last year, while both sides of Sherpur Chowk and Cancer Hospital flyover were opened this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/rail-overbridge-in-ludhiana-develops-cracks-a-week-after-it-opens/story-FStPQfG5KHldRwbGSDni6M.html

01-06-2020||Delhi||His dream shattered in four months, he waits for a way home||When 26-year-old physically disabled wheelchair-bound Mohammad Wahab came to Delhi from his hometown Motihari in Bihar this February, he planned to earn some money to ensure that his then yet-to-be-born child survived, unlike his two sons who, he claimed, died of improper nourishment.Wahab started selling vegetables near Jama Masjid in the Walled City. But the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) followed by the lockdown destroyed his business and shattered his dreams. Having exhausted almost all his savings in the last two months, Wahab reached Anand Vihar railway station on Sunday morning but could not find a train departing for his hometown. He spent the last of his savings (₹500) to buy a ticket for a Motihari-bound train scheduled to depart on June 2 and was wait-listed.Determined to board the train, and not die a homeless migrant in Delhi, Wahab has made his wheelchair his home and a spot below the foot overbridge in the railway station’s compound his temporary shelter.“Delhi mein roz log mar rahe hain corona se. Yahan marunga to koi dekhne wale bhi nahi hoga. Gaon mein marengen to kum se kum apne gharwalon ki di hui mitti to naseeb hogi. (People are dying every day in Delhi because of the virus. If I die in Delhi, nobody will be around me. If I die in my village, at least my family will bury me with dignity,” Wahab said.“My wheelchair is my home now. Whatever clothes, food and water I own, I have tied all of it to my wheelchair. I cannot live in shelter homes because using the mobile public toilets there isn’t possible for me,” Wahab said while eating rotis and an omelette on a footpath near the station’s exit lane.Wahab got married to Rabhujan, who is also physically disabled, in his hometown around seven years ago. Three years ago, the couple lost their first son Irfan at the age of two.“Doctor bole Irfan khoon ki kami se mar gaye kyonki usko pura khana nahi mil raha tha (the doctor told us that Irfan died of anaemia because he was not getting proper diet and nutrition). Mera dusra beta janam k kuch hafton mein mar gaya. Usko bhi khoon ki kami thi aur wo bahut kamjor bhi tha (Our second son also died within a few weeks after birth. He was also weak and had anaemia),” Wahab said.Wahab said that when he learnt that his wife was pregnant for the third time sometime in December, he decided he wouldn’t let their third child meet the same fate. When his efforts to earn a livelihood in their hometown failed, Wahab contacted his childhood friend Zubair, who promised to help him if he came to Delhi.“In the last week of February, I boarded a Delhi-bound train. I travelled without a ticket as I had no money to buy one. I pretended I was a beggar when the train ticket examiner came by and somehow reached Delhi,” he said.Combining the money he borrowed from Zubair and his earnings through begging, Wahab started selling vegetables on the roadside near Jama Masjid. He rented a room for ₹1,000 per month. But before his business could increase, the pandemic hit the city and the government’s lockdown announcement forced him to shut it down.Being physically disabled, he could not travel around like other vegetable sellers to buy and sell vegetables. Soon, his savings started dwindling and he began fearing he would die of Covid-19.“Someone told me about the Shramik train and I reached Anand Vihar railway station, only to find that the trains are only for migrants who have registered themselves. A policeman helped me buy a ticket for the special train on June 2. I will stay put here till I board the train,” Wahab added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/his-dream-shattered-in-four-months-he-waits-for-a-way-home/story-hM1ACspobUCS4R4WeQSyAK.html

A detailed order of what will be open and what will continue to be shut was issued by the state government on Sunday, but the Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, as per powers conferred to him by Maharashtra’s chief secretary, will issue the detailed order for the city on Monday.“We will issue the order on Monday which will have clear guidelines on what all additional restrictions will be relaxed. As per state guidelines some more shops, private cabs and autorickshaws for essential services can be allowed to operate.”Gaikwad will also redraw the containment zone map, adding a few more areas and removing those where cases have reduced. “Instead of sealing the entire area, we will rather adopt a micro-containment strategy and seal few houses, a society or a building from where Covid-19 cases are being reported,” said the municipal chief. As per the government’s latest order, cycling, jogging, running in playgrounds, beaches, society premises, gardens and open spaces are now allowed by maintaining social distancing.

When I told him I am not afraid of death, he said he will gun me down in a month,” said Giri.The Shiv Sena leader added that he suspected the hand of pro-Khalistani groups behind the 48-second call. Following the complaint, Khanna deputy superintendent of police (DSP, Khanna) Rajan Parminder Singh, inspector Harvinder Singh Khaira, who is the station house officer of Khanna City-2 police station, reached the leader’s residence and reviewed his security cover.  The DSP said that police had initiated investigation and were trying to trace the call. It is suspected that the call has been made using online calling applications.The attack on Giri had taken place on March 9. Two motorcycle-borne miscreants had opened fire at Giri, however, he escaped unhurt. The men, one of who was a wearing a helmet and the other whose face was covered with piece of cloth, were captured in closed-circuit television cameras installed near his house.

01-06-2020||Pune||Left stranded at Pune station West Bengal-bound migrants finally board train home||A group of migrants from West Bengal who were ferried to Pune station on Saturday, could not board the Shramik special train due to lack of space. After spending the night at the railway station, these migrants were finally provided seats and left for their hometown at 4pm on Sunday.“On Saturday, hundreds of us were left stranded at the station, despite having the chits as token. We kept waiting till late in the night, but the police dispersed us stating that our train was cancelled. However, we saw some of the people who were with us board the train at 2pm,” said Saiful Islam, 22, who wanted to go Kolkata. “We live in Kamshet and had signed up at multiple places in hope of getting a call from at least one place. We filed applications at Talegaon and Wadgaon,” said Saiful Haq, 20 who was travelling to Kolkata.Rajeev Ghosh, 21, who was in the same group as Haq said, “We got a call from Talegaon tehsil office on Friday. We were given chits and asked to board the bus. We were made to wait at the station and were taken back in the buses. On Saturday, we got a call from Wadgaon and were ferried to the station again. Most people told us that the train was cancelled as we watched the people who had travelled with us here, get on trains and leave. The buses had left and we were to fend for ourselves at the station,” said Rajeev Ghosh, 21, who was to travel to his village after reaching Kolkata.The problem arose when the labourers were left stranded at the station without clear instructions about whether a train was going to be arranged for them or not. They were provided with food and water for the night but left with no other choice but to sleep on the street or at the empty bus stop.A train was finally arranged for them at 4pm on Sunday.“We provide trains as per the requirement cited by the state and only those many people can board the train. These passengers must have been beyond the capacity of the train. So, as per the new requirement cited by the state, on Sunday, we merged them with passengers from Ahmednagar and made one train available,” said a railway official requesting anonymity.So far, 2,04,695 people have left on 154 Shramik Special trains from Pune division, according to the office of divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar. Of the 154 trains, 61 were for labourers from Uttar Pradesh, 36 for Bihar, 15 for Madhya Pradesh, 13 for West Bengal, eight for Jharkhand, five for Chattisgarh, five for Rajasthan, two each for Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu and Odisha, and one each for Himachal Pradesh, Jammu-Kashmir, Manipur and Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/left-stranded-at-pune-station-west-bengal-bound-migrants-finally-board-train-home/story-bYttYLLs9UBPDQtno7eqWJ.html

01-06-2020||City||Monsoon at doorstep, but gullies in Mohali still clogged||Though pre-monsoon showers are likely to hit the region in two weeks, Mohali, like every year, is still not rain ready. Authorities are yet start cleaning of city’s road gullies, stated to be around 13,000 in number. A majority of these gullies are blocked, Hindustan Times has found.While 7,000 road gullies are under the jurisdiction of the public health department, 3,000 are under the municipal corporation, while 3,000 fall under the purview of Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA). None of the authorities has started cleaning the gullies.Every year, a budget of ₹1 crore is allocated for cleaning of gullies before the onset of monsoon. Yet every year, life goes out of gear as roads get inundated after just few hours of rain. On Sunday also, roads in Phase 4 were flooded just after two hours of showers.Among the worst-hit areas in Mohali are Mataur village in Sector 70, Phase 4, 5, 11, 3B1 and 3B2. Monsoon is especially a nightmare at Mataur village due to congested streets, choked drains and lack of space to construct additional drains.When contacted, public health department’s executive engineer Kamal Kishore said, “We have already floated the tender and work will hopefully begin next week. We are expecting the cleaning of gullies to be complete in a month’s time.” GMADA executive engineer Pankaj Mahmi said, “We have just started the cleaning work and we are sure we will finish it on time.”Punjab’s former town planning director MS Aujla, who is a resident of Mohali, said, “It’s the same story every year. Our drainage system cannot handle increased intensity of rain spells. Authorities should think of a long-term solution and increase the carrying capacity of drainage system. It is time we conduct an audit of the drainage system, keeping the climate change and extreme events in mind.”CL Garg, president of the Confederation of Greater Mohali Residents’ Welfare Associations (RWA), the apex body of the 65 RWAs, said, “It is strange that every year, they start cleaning work at the eleventh hour. The officers concerned should be held responsible for the mess. There used to be no waterlogging about 20 years ago as the roads were not above the plinth level. Now, roads dividing sectors are above the plinth level of houses, resulting in rainwater flowing into houses.” He added, “Authorities have been flouting the norms by laying pre-mix without digging up the roads. Consequently, the height of the roads keeps increasing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/monsoon-at-the-doorstep-but-gullies-in-mohali-yet-to-be-cleaned/story-52WXnrLU1oe9vPdYNxXBRN.html
01-06-2020||Pune||Pune’s Market Yard vegetable market resumes operations||After two months of shut down, the agricultural produce market committee (APMC) vegetable market at Market Yard resumed operations on May 31. The market was shut down as a precautionary measure on April 10, due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic.The market has resumed services with several new rules, restrictions, and taking all the precautionary and safety measures. It is the biggest vegetable market in Pune through which daily vegetables and fruits are being supplied to all parts of Pune.According to Pune APMC chairman Balasaheb Deshmukh, the decision to reopen the market was taken after instructions were given by deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and minister Balasaheb Patil.“From 9pm Saturday night, a total of 200 trucks carrying 11,000 quintals of vegetable goods arrived at the main Market Yard vegetable market. Then on Sunday morning from 4.30am the actual trading of goods started, while doing this we made various changes in the operations. Accordingly, every day only 50 per cent of traders and agents will keep their shops open. On every alternate day, each trader will get a chance to do business. Every shop can unload only one truck goods at his shop. The number of vehicle entry is being reduced to 200 daily and while entering into the market premises thermal checking of each person is being done. The entire market was completely sanitised before it was started. We will operate daily, so that citizens will get adequate and low price vegetables from now,” Deshmukh said.While traders are happy to resume business, Ramesh Vaychal one of the traders said, “It is good that vegetable market at Market Yard is started and with all precautions. It is a big challenge for everyone now, as at such market places avoiding crowds and monitoring vehicles is a tough task. If citizens cooperate with the APMC management then the market will run smoothly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/market-yard-vegetable-market-resumes-operations/story-5uadQvPqH7DUkrLKeor9zI.html

01-06-2020||Pune||Pune’s sports equipment industry locked down, but not locked out||The months of March, April, and May are peak season for the sports equipment industry, however, businesses in the city may have incurred massive losses due to the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Champion Sports shop owner Amit Madan. There are around 150 specialised sports equipment shops in Pune, PCMC area and over 500-600 shops that keep specific sports items.“I think looking at the number of shops around Pune, our industry has suffered a loss of around Rs 1 crore,” Madan said. “Sports shops will still take time to witness normal customer footfall. Currently, we don’t have any plans on how we will increase our sales. First, let things become normal, then only can we decide. Right now generally people are buying yoga mats, skipping ropes and few weights for fitness,” added Madan.With businesses opening up last week, sports shops continue to be deserted since sporting activities are yet to resume in the city.“When lockdown was announced it was the start of the swimming season, summer camps, visit to aqua parks and regular swimmers. All these add to a lot of sale of swimming equipment which adds good amount of money but unfortunately it did not happen,” explains Nitin Khurana of Maharashtra Sales and Cooperations who has a wholesale business of sports equipment in Raviwar peth.During summer, swimming and cricket equipment has the most demand. “Cricket camps across the city almost double up the sale of cricket equipment. And now with rainy season approaching, the focus shifts on football, but I think football season will also be dull this time,” added Khurana.Demand for carrom boardsIn the ongoing lockdown, there has been a big demand for carrom boards but they are not easily available in the market.“Carrom boards are not made in machines, it is a hand-made product. Since workers are not available or are in lesser number, there has been a shortage of boards. The sale of other boards like ludo, chess, snake ladder have also gone up across the city,” said Khurana.Shortage of customersWith businesses opening up last week, sports shops continue to be deserted since sporting activities are yet to resume in the city.“Generally, there are 10 customers at a time keep on asking for different sports equipment but now there is only one customer. Sports shops will still take time to get their normal number of customers back,” said Amit Madan owner of Champion Sports, Deccan Gymkhana.“Currently we don’t have any plans on how we will increase our sales. First let things become normal then only we can decide. Right now generally people are buying yoga mats, skipping ropes and few weights for fitness” added Madan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-s-sports-equipment-industry-locked-down-but-not-locked-out/story-Jwvf9QGO7TotE9SvVqQXAL.html
