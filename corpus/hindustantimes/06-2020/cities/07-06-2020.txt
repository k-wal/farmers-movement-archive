07-06-2020||Kolkata||TMC ups the ante with direct attack on Centre ahead of Amit Shah’s Bengal address||Ahead of union home minister Amit Shah’s address to the people of Bengal on June 9, West Bengal’s ruling party Trinamool Congress (TMC) on Sunday sharpened its attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led union government, accusing the Centre of causing disasters with “unplanned lockdown” and disrupting the state’s plan of bringing back migrant workers in a phased manner.Blaming the railways for the sudden spike in Bengal’s Covid-19 infection count led by migrant workers returning to the state, TMC all-India general secretary Subrata Bakshi said, “The railways forcefully sent back a large number of migrant workers in packed trains, violating all social distancing norms, and disrupting the state’s own plan to bring them back in a phased manner. They had no plan for the lockdown and spoilt the state’s plan for keeping Bengal safe.”Urban development minister Firhad Hakim, too, targeted the Centre. “Our focus is the post-corona, post-cyclone situation. Their focus is next year’s election. The priorities are clear,” Hakim said, adding, “Our government held two meetings with opposition parties and accepted some of their proposals with an absolutely open mind. But what did the opposition parties do? They played politics.”Amid BJP’s incisive attacks on the Mamata Banerjee government over alleged mismanagement of the Covid-19 situation and cyclone Amphan, TMC has been upping the ante against the Centre over the past few days.Ministers, including Hakim, Partha Chatterjee and Rajib Banerjee have blamed “centre’s unplanned lockdown” for the recent steep rise in India’s Covid-19 numbers. TMC leaders have also cited Gujarat’s example to claim that BJP-ruled states had fared poorly in Covid management due to alleged lack of planning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/tmc-ups-the-ante-with-direct-attack-on-centre-ahead-of-amit-shah-s-bengal-address/story-W0axpWJ07YEJoJ9fYtTFVO.html

07-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab agri dept expects 25% of area under paddy to be DSR||With labour scarce due to the covid-19 pandemic, the state agricultural department estimates that nearly 25% of area under paddy will come under Direct Seeding of Rice (DSR), instead of the traditional transplantation of the crop this year. The department has sanctioned 4,000 DSR machines and 800 paddy transplanting machines to farmers on subsidy ranging between 40% and 50%. The department says that this would help cut the cultivation cost in terms of both labour and water use. State agriculture secretary KS Pannu had earlier targeted to bring an area of 5 lakh hectare under the DSR technique,but given the labour shortage and interest that farmers have shown to the advance technology, 6-7 lakh hectare will be under DSR. This is roughly 25% of area under paddy cultivation in Punjab, which is expected to be around 27 lakh hectare (66 lakh acre). Pannu added that the DSR technique would be instrumental in saving about 30% of water and would also cut down cost of paddy cultivation by nearly Rs 6,000 per acre. He added that as per PAU experts, yield of paddy from DSR is on a par with the crop grown by conventional technique of transplanting.He added, “Our officials have been guiding farmers in the field about the best way to go about the technology. Farmers must spray weedicide within 24 hours of sowing the crop, as control over weedicide is crucial.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-agri-dept-expects-25-of-area-under-paddy-to-be-dsr/story-4L5ZknvP5spj8C7EJlC2GP.html
07-06-2020||Delhi||Popular joints in Khan Market forced to shut shop in face of mounting losses due to lockdown||As the capital has started opening up gradually after three months of a nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), several popular shops, restaurants and book stores have been forced to shut as a result of the losses incurred due to the prolonged closure.Last week, three stores in south Delhi’s upscale Khan Market decided to close down or curtail operations, being unable to bear the high rents, salaries of employees and the estimates of future operations. The stores included a two-decade old cafe and bookstore, Full Circle and Cafe Turtle, an Asian restaurant, Side Wok and another barbeque restaurant, Smokeys BBQ and Grill. Priyanka Malhotra, the owner of Full Circle and Cafe Turtle, said it was after several rounds of negotiations with the Khan Market Traders’ Association and the National Restaurant Association of India that they decided to pull down the shutters.The concept of this bookstore-cum-cafe which started business in Khan Market in 1998, from shop number 5 and later moved to shop number 23, was to allow avid readers a place to spend their afternoons and evenings flipping pages while sipping their cuppas and slicing into their famous date and carrot cakes.“It surely was not an easy decision. It was a legacy and you don’t give that up till things really get difficult. There were several questions that we needed to answer, going ahead how do we maintain social distancing in a bookstore that has a cafe, how do we manage the rent when we were not making a single penny ourselves and most importantly how do we ensure that our staff and customers remain safe,” Malhotra said.She, however, clarified that the bookstore has two more branches in Greater Kailash-1 N-Block and Nizamuddin East, which will continue to cater to the bibliophiles in the city.Along with this 22-year-old bookstore and cafe, two other popular food joints have made an exit from Khan Market. Sidewok, an Asian cuisine restaurant, has been running from the market for nearly 16 years while it has been around six years since Smokeys BBQ and Grill opened its outlet here.Both these restaurants also decided to shut down operations because of high rents and the added financial liabilities. Sidewok initially had two branches in the same market, one in shop number 45 and another in number 19. It eventually closed off its operations from shop 45 and moved to shop number 19. Similarly, Smokeys was located in shop number 51. While Sidewok refused to respond to e-mail queries and the questionnaire sent to Smokeys remained unanswered.Anshu Tondon, president of the Khan Market Traders’ Association, said that they tried to negotiate between the owners of the restaurants and the landlords but it was a tricky situation that ended in the exit.“It was truly heartbreaking. It has understandably become difficult for businesses to continue operations in the new scenario. Because many of these restaurants serve dishes that require dining in and cannot be delivered through a takeaway service, it was complete rout for them. Many landlords here are senior citizens and they depend on what they get as rents from here, so they would not agree to negotiate much,” Tondon said.Without giving out more names Tondon said that there were more establishments that were negotiating the terms of rent with their landlords.In Connaught Place too, businesses are facing difficulties. Atul Bhargava, president of New Delhi Traders’ Association (NDTA), said even though the old timers are managing, it is the newer shops that are the worst affected. How many restaurants and shops are forced to shut shops will be clearer once all restaurants open on Monday, he said. “Restaurants that served 100 people can only seat 20-25 people now. The business has taken a major hit and the next three to four months are going to be tough for the business community. The government must announce some financial package to help businesses stay afloat,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/popular-joints-in-khan-market-forced-to-shut-shop-in-face-of-mouting-losses-due-to-lockdown/story-Yh4jal5RGhrm9bZ8Dz9qIM.html

The Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), which manages the historic shrine and prominent gurdwaras in north India, said it cannot break the tradition that has continued since the times of the Gurus. The Golden Temple remained open even during the lockdown even as the administration restricted the devotees from entering. A few people kept on coming to the shrine and langar and karah parsad were served to them.“Deg (a nomenclature of ‘karah parsad’) is mentioned in the daily ardas. Maryada is not considered complete without it. The ban should be revoked,” said SGPC spokesperson Kulwinder Singh Ramdas.“The needy partake of langar at the Golden Temple on daily basis. When people were stuck in various places and lost their livelihoods during the lockdown, gurdwaras fed many. Nobody among those who partook of langar was infected,” he added.On Saturday, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said. “We are following all the guidelines of the health department while preparing and serving the langar. The ban on langar and parsad must be reviewed.”Also, the managing committee of the Durgiana Temple, a major place of worship of Hindus in Amritsar, is also going to defy the guidelines in case of serving parsad.“We will follow the guidelines which are necessary, but not the ones against our faith. We will take all the steps to curb the disease. No priest will touch the ‘parsad’ brought by the devotees for ‘bhog’,” said temple committee president Ramesh Sharma. “The temple staff will take proper precautions will be taken while distributing the ‘parsad’ by wearing gloves and masks. We will hold a meeting on Monday morning to decide on serving langar,” added Sharma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/golden-temple-other-gurdwaras-to-serve-langar-parsad-despite-govt-guidelines/story-wQBH8o6LiXyPDmJ0icq1hP.html

07-06-2020||Chandigarh||In Punjab urban body polls, only women to contest from odd-numbered wards||In the upcoming elections for the Punjab urban local bodies, including nine municipal corporations and 117 municipal councils and notified area committees, only women will be able to contest from the odd-numbered wards while the even ones will remain open for candidates of both the genders. A decision to this effect was taken recently by local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra on the lines of a law passed in 2017 by the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government as per which 50% wards should be reserved for women candidates. “Male candidates will be able to contest from even-numbered wards only. But a female candidate can also contest from an even-numbered ward, if she wishes. Our department will work out the modalities to start the process in the coming week. Reservation for scheduled caste (SC) candidates in women category will be announced soon,” said Mohindra. Administrators were appointed to run municipal corporations of Bathinda, Moga, Hoshiarpur, Phagwara, Pathankot, and Mohali besides 117 municipal councils and notified area committees after the terms of their elected bodies ended between March 8 and April 26. As per the Punjab Municipal Act, the civic bodies should go to the polls within six months of their tenure comes to an end. There are a total of 167 urban civic bodies in Punjab.Since the civic bodies in Abohar, Kapurthala and Batala upgraded of late, they are still to get elected bodies as municipal corporations. The delimitation of wards in these civic bodies is still underway. In June 2017, the state government decided to increase women reservation in urban local bodies and panchayati raj institutions from the existing 33% to 50%, one of the promises of the Congress in the run-up to the assembly elections. The civic body polls will not be held before September due to the Covid-19 pandemic even as the state government in February had said they will be held in June and July. “There is uncertainty over the poll schedule. We are not in a position to take any decision due to the pandemic. But we have put the process in motion by initiating the delimitation of wards on the basis of population. We may also increase the number of wards in some cities, if needed,” Mohindra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/in-punjab-urban-body-polls-only-women-to-contest-from-odd-numbered-wards/story-kOTjkRBjeNvd9hsMO1EWjK.html

As they already have a system, so there was no need for a separate order to limit the parking spaces,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.Apart from following SOP, the mall managers have also been advised to have a separate room or isolation room to keep any worker or visitor showing Covid-19 symptoms, till the medical help arrives.With a few districts in the state seeing a separate district level order for malls and restaurants, creating confusion among a number of restaurant owners, the GB Nagar district magistrate clarified that the restaurants will not need a separate order from the district administration.“Whatever the state government has allowed can function without requirement of any further or additional permission. Only establishments like gymnasiums, which are not allowed to function by the state government, will not operate. All permitted activities by the state government shall be treated as permissible and they should be carried out without getting separate permission or pass,” said the district magistrate.According to the SOP, shopping malls, hotels and restaurants will also have to ensure thorough disinfecting of floor area, elevators and door knobs within short intervals. Social distancing norms have to be followed strictly everywhere, the officials said.The state government has also ordered to adhere to the contactless payment modes only.“All the shopping malls, restaurants and hotels shall accept payment through contactless mode, like e-wallets, digital payments, online payments, code scanning only,” says the state government’s SOP.Meanwhile, the shopping malls in Noida said that they are making all necessary arrangements for reopening. While some will resume operations in coming days, a few said that they will begin operations from Monday itself.“We are resuming operations from Monday between 11am and 8pm. We have also ensured all the steps to contain the pandemic, including mist sanitisation of all vehicles entering the mall, no valet parking to minimise the touch points and separate bio-hazard bins for masks, gloves and used napkins,” said Ravi Sodhi, director (communication), Wave Group that runs Waves Mall at Sector 18.The Logix mall at Noida City Centre asserted that they will start operation from Tuesday and expect a footfall of around 10,000 a day against the usual 50,000.“We have already made all necessary preparations, and have decided to take one additional day for buffer to ensure a few more steps, including creating an isolation room for any emergency. Our operations will begin from Tuesday onwards. We did not reduce our staff strength during the lockdown period. But we will begin with limited staff and keep others on standby. If the footfall increases, the staff strength will be managed accordingly,” said Amit Taneja, vice-president (operations), Logix.The DLF Mall of India, one of the largest malls in Noida, said that they will resume operations in the coming week.“We are prepared to open our malls in adherence with the guidelines being laid down by the MHA and further local authorities. Right from the temperature checks at our mall entrances to the use of Aarogya Setu app will be made mandatory for shoppers to enter our malls. We are also embracing technology for providing real time foot traffic and notifications on safety and cleanliness, among other such facilities, through ‘Lukout’ app,” said Pushpa Bector, executive director, DLF shopping malls. Meanwhile, a number of restaurant owners in the city foresee losses due to the curfew timings.“Most of the family restaurants, especially the fine dining ones, have decided not to resume operations from Monday. There are no issues with following the SOPs to contain the pandemic, but the curfew timings have curbed our mealtime. While for a proper fine dining restaurant, the peak time is between 8.30 to 9 pm, but due to the curfew timing we will have to wrap up by 8pm. So, we are not expecting business,” said Varun Khera, head of National Restaurant Association of India (Noida chapter) who owns Desi Vibes restaurant in Sector 18.Some hotel owners have echoed the similar views. “We are ready to host our guests and getting things aligned. Once all preparations are done, we shall be opening up. But the international flights are not operational and the domestic movement is not that much either, we don’t expect to have numbers coming into Greater Noida as such,” SM Azmat, president, Jaypee Greens Golf and Spa Resort, Greater Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-shopping-malls-restaurants-set-to-open-today/story-2sgGRd4e879emJFi5AYTsL.html
07-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad border with Delhi to stay shut for now||Ghaziabad district administration on Sunday said that their borders will continue to remain sealed till further directions, even as Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that the capital will lift restrictions on inter-state movement from tomorrow (Monday). Officials of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) also said that they have completed repair work near UP-Gate that will provide relief to commuters moving to Delhi.The Ghaziabad district magistrate on April 22 had imposed restrictions on inter-border movement of people, citing rising number of Covid-19 cases in the district. Additional restrictions were put in place on May 27. Later, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on June 1 had announced the closure of border for a week.“There are no directions issued by the district magistrate for opening of Ghaziabad’s border with Delhi. The previous directions will continue to be in force,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city).The UP-Gate border is a major transit point for people from Ghaziabad to go to east Delhi. The border witnessed movement of at least 80,000 passenger cars daily on an average, as per estimates of the NHAI, before the lockdown. Traffic at present, however, has reduced to one-fourth due to restricted movement during the lockdown period.Of late, the UP-Gate has become a major choke point, where thousands of commuters getting caught in snarls daily due to checks and barricades put up by the Ghaziabad police. Another major issue in the area was a 200 metres dug up patch of NH-9, which restricted movement of commuters travelling from Ghaziabad to Delhi.“The barricades on Ghaziabad side of the UP-Gate flyover are put up by the police. It is their call if they wish to remove these barricades or not,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI..“We have completed the repair work of the dug up patch of the highway, near the UP-Gate flyover. Repair was needed as the highway and the expressway lanes were not at same level. Now, the work in the area . We have also decided to open five lanes on each side of the Hindon canal bridge. This will further ease commuting from Ghaziabad to Delhi,” Garg added.SP city Manish Mishra still late on Sunday night did not respond to a query by Hindustan Times on whether the barricades will be removed on Monday.The barricades on the Ghaziabad side of the UP-Gate flyover have posed issues for commuters who are forced to take the underpass area.“This leads to traffic snarls. If the barricades are removed, after the border is de-sealed, then commuters from Ghaziabad can avoid the underpass area and can go straight to Delhi. Since Delhi has announced opening of its borders, commuters will again start arriving at UP-Gate and more jams are likely,” said Kuldeep Saxena, a commuter from Indirapuram.Following a petition, the Supreme Court on Thursday had directed the central government to convene a meeting between the officials from Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana to find a solution over the chaos near the Delhi borders.Ajay Shankar Pandey, the Ghaziabad district magistrate, did not respond to calls for a comment on Sunday.“Since the UP government is a party to the case, the directions will be issued from Lucknow. We are waiting for instructions and hopeful that some solution will come out,” Pandey had said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-border-with-delhi-to-stay-shut-for-now/story-uHBDnt0Qa5PFfqJNTCYwAK.html
07-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Malls, restaurants directed to take up sanitization, can reopen from June 10||Ghaziabad: Shopping malls, restaurants and hotels in the district will have to wait for at least two more days to resume their operations. All such establishments have been asked to take up sanitization procedures as per protocol before they can reopen, officials of the district administration said on Sunday.However, the religious places have been allowed to reopen their gates for devotees, the officials said.While the Uttar Pradesh government has allowed reopening of public places such as malls and restaurants from Monday (June 8) across the state, the Ghaziabad administration has given two days’ time to such establishments for preparations required to resume operations. Hotels and restaurants in the district will reopen from June 10, while the malls may be allowed to resume operations only from June 11.The decision was taken after a meeting of district administration and police officials, and representatives from different malls, hotels and restaurants. During discussion, it came out that two to three days’ time will be given for cleaning, sanitization and making other arrangements as per the UP government’s directions issued on June 6 for opening up various establishments under the phase 2 of Unlock 1.0.“It has been decided that malls are given minimum three days for making arrangements, while hotels and restaurants have been given two days’ time for the purpose. They will not open up before June 10. During this period, district officials will check the preparedness and if found satisfactory, the district magistrate will issue directions for opening up,” said Manish Mishra, superintendent of police (city) who was present at the meeting on Sunday.However, religious places have been allowed to reopen, Mishra said. The district administration on Sunday, however, relaxed timings for opening of shops and markets.“The district magistrate has issued written directions that all shops and markets will now open from 9am to 9pm, but the days of opening of markets will remain same as per the previous order. The shops of fruits, vegetables, dairy, sweets and grocery will also now open from 9am to 9pm,” the spokesperson for district administration said on Sunday.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not take calls despite repeated attempts.Earlier, the 34 major markets in different areas were asked to open from 10am to 5pm. Similarly, till Sunday the grocery shops were allowed to open up only from 10am to 4pm, while fruit/vegetable shops were directed for opening from 10am to 2pm.Though members of the market association appreciated the decision for extension of timings, they slammed the alternate day system for opening of markets.“We are not able to understand why the markets are not allowed to open on all days. This will further lead to large gathering of customers. In places like Delhi where markets are opening up on all days, we have different directions in Ghaziabad. This will not serve purpose of the traders,” said Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti – Indirapuram.“On the other hand, liquor shops are allowed to open on all days. Even the traders in the market at Vaishali are also suffering as the area has been sealed. The markets there opened only for couple of days before the administration gave orders for sealing,” he added.The state government’s announcement for reopening of religious places, malls, offices, restaurants, etc. are accompanied by several mandatory conditions. The guidelines have also advised that elderly persons and those with comorbidities, children below 10 years of age and pregnant woman should avoid movement outside.Meanwhile, religious places have made arrangements to reopen from Monday. “The administration has left the timing of opening up of religious places to us. We will open from 5.30am till 8pm. At our premises, we will not allow devotees to touch idols or ring bells. Sanitization tunnel and thermal screening equipment have also been put in place, besides the circles marked for social distancing,” said Mahant Narayan Giri, caretaker of ancient Dudheshwar Nath Temple in Ghaziabad.The state government’s directions have made it mandatory for six feet of social distancing, thermal scanning and sanitization before entering any public place. Likewise, not more than five persons would be allowed inside religious places at a time and not before they have been subjected to thermal scan which has been made mandatory even for entry to malls and eateries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-malls-restaurants-directed-to-take-up-sanitization-can-reopen-from-june-10/story-Wz5Tg9CSvLWKCgplZPjhwN.html
07-06-2020||Chandigarh||Not ours: Chandigarh tries to get Manimajra Covid case added to Haryana’s tally||Something of a tussle over a new Covid-19 patient from Manimajra was reported today between Chandigarh and Haryana, with the UT health department refusing to include him in its tally on Sunday, instead suggesting that he be added to Haryana’s positive count as he was tested in Panchkula.The health department said the 46-year-old man who runs a computer shop in sector 20 and employs eight to 10 workers, should not be included in the city’s tally as he was sampled, tested positive and isolated in neighbouring Panchkula district . Panchkula health authorities in turn argued that as the patient belonged to Chandigarh’s Manimajra, the case could not be added to the district’s count.“He is from Chandigarh and should be counted in Chandigarh. Border area issues need to be resolved,” said Dr Jasjit Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula.According to Chandigarh’s official media bulletin the total tally as of now stands at 314 cases, excluding the Manimajra case.When asked to comment, UT health secretary Arun Gupta said, “it does not makes any difference whether the case is counted in Haryana or Chandigarh.”Two of the patient’s family members have been sampled at the Government Multi-Specialtiy Hospital in Sector 16. Around 30 contacts have been home quarantined. At present, Chandigarh has 35 active cases, while 274 have recovered and five others have died.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/not-ours-chandigarh-tries-to-get-manimajra-covid-case-added-to-haryana-s-tally/story-CZTyNutxE3Ylrj6JKQYwKN.html
07-06-2020||Noida||Death of pregnant woman: Interim inquiry report awaited||Even after two days a 30-year-old pregnant woman allegedly died due to denial of treatment by eight private and government hospitals in Noida and Ghaziabad, the inquiry report in the investigation is yet to come.The eight-month-old pregnant woman, Neelam, a resident of Khora Colony in Ghaziabad, had complained of breathlessness on Friday morning. She was rushed by family members from one hospital to another, but was denied treatment by all hospitals, citing non-availability of beds. Private hospitals claimed that as per government guidelines they are not authorised to treat suspected Covid-19 patients. The woman died in around 7.30pm in the ambulance itself after which the district magistrate (DM) set up an inquiry in the matter.The DM also pulled up the hospitals for alleged negligence in the case. “In case of an emergency, hospitals have been instructed to assume that the patient is Covid-19 positive and take necessary precautions while providing treatment. There is obvious negligence in the case. The investigation report will clarify who is at fault,” said DM Suhas LY.Officials feel that there are several angles to the case and it requires comprehensive investigation because of the number of hospitals involved. They said that the investigation will take time but they will come up with an interim report soon after which some immediate action will be taken against the erring parties.Administration officials also said that the woman’s body was handed over to the family without an autopsy and without any sample being taken for performing a Covid-19 test.“We are meeting the family, who have just returned from Garh Mukteshwar after the woman’s last rites to establish a timeline of the incident. An interim report will be possible soon. There are several factors that are the part of the inquiry and due action will be taken soon,” said MN Upadhyay, ADM, finance.“We were busy with the last rites and were unable to file any complaint. My son will turn six-years-old in two days and has been asking for his mother. The whole situation is surreal and we haven’t even had time to process it,” said Bijender Singh, the woman’s husband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/death-of-pregnant-woman-interim-inquiry-report-awaited/story-OhUE0Tshir8CweUMdXfezM.html

07-06-2020||City||As Covid-19 cases rise, Ghaziabad faces shortage of beds at L1 hospital||Ghaziabad: With rising number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad, the district is facing a shortage of L1 category operational beds. As a result, the health department is forced to admit the L1 category patients to its L2 Covid hospital at Sanjay Nagar.In Ghaziabad, ESIC Hospital in Sahibabad is an L1 category facility where all the 76 beds are fully occupied, while the district hospital at Sanjay Nagar is a L2 category hospital with 100 beds. Another L1 category hospital at Muradnagar has 30 beds, but the facility is currently not operational, health officials said. The Uttar Pradesh government has created a dedicated chain of Covid-19 hospitals in the state — L1, L2 and L3. The L1 category of hospitals deals with uncomplicated cases of Covid-19 and each district has at least one such hospital, while the cases that require more attention are sent to L2 category hospitals and critical patients are sent to L3 category hospitals for specialised treatment. “Of 100 beds in our hospital, 49 are occupied at present. But about 40 of these patients are L1 category ones, as all beds at L1 category ESIC Hospital are occupied. The other 30-bed L1 hospital at Muradnagar was also closed down. I have written to senior health department officials in Lucknow about this issue,” said Dr Naresh Vij, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar hospital.On Sunday, Ghaziabad reported 32 new Covid-19 cases, taking the district’s tally to 474, while the active cases stood at 158. The health department officials expect that with markets, malls and other public places getting opened up, there will be a rise in number of Covid-19 cases. There has been a surge in positive cases in June. As per records, 169 cases have been added during the period from June 1 to June 7.Vij said that they are facing issues due to the admission of L1 patients. “The L2 patients are generally bed ridden and put on drip or need oxygen support. On the other hand, the L1 patients are generally asymptomatic and they have tendency to move around in the ward. So, we need to make extra efforts to control them. Further, if our beds get filled up, there is no other L2 hospital in Ghaziabad,” Vij added.Notably, the 30-bed L1 category facility at CHC Murdnagar was the first Covid-dedicated hospital in Ghaziabad. The health department closed it down after it remained operational for over a month. Now, the ESIC Hospital in Sahibabad has taken up the workload of admitting L1 patients.“Since L1 category ESIC Hospital is fully saturated, we have shifted L1 patients to the Sanjay Nagar hospital. Our main focus now is to create L1 hospitals,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.He said that the L1 hospital at Murdnagar was shut down as the same staff which looked after 30 beds will now be roped in for the proposed 200-bed L1 facility at Niwari.“We have now planned to soon open up 60-bed Mariam Hospital in Nandgram and 200-bed Divyajyoti College at Niwari as our new L1 hospitals. We are making arrangements. The L1 category facilities are being developed as the number of cases is rising, and only about 10% patients need treatment at L2 or L3 hospitals. Unlike other states where home quarantine for asymptomatic patients is prevalent, we have no such arrangement. Further, it also becomes difficult to monitor movement of home quarantined patients,” Gupta said.Recently, the district came up with an L3 facility at Santosh Medical College.“At present, we have only one L3 hospital at Santosh Medical College which has 400 beds. We have 18 patients admitted there. The ventilator support is only available on 16 beds, while rest of the beds are equipped with oxygen support. In a way, the beds having only oxygen support can be considered as L2 beds,” the CMO said. He also said that there is a proposal for converting quarantine centres to ‘L1 attached’ hospitals where purely asymptomatic patients will be kept.“Once they come up, we will transfer positive patients having very mild symptoms to L1 hospitals while asymptomatic patients will be kept at L1 attached hospitals. So, under this procedure we have planned to tackle rising number of cases,” Gupta said.In Ghaziabad, the first Covid-19 case was reported on March 5, and the figure slowly reached 50 cases on April 22 after about 48 days. The next 50 cases were reported by May 5 in a span of about 13 days. The next 50 cases (total case count 150) happened in another 10 days on May 15 while the district crossed the 200 mark on May 21 in another six days. However, the next 100 cases arrived in just 10 days with the district crossing the 300 mark on May 31. The next 100 cases have arrived in a span of just six days and the total on June 6 stood at 442.According to health officials, the 32 Covid-19 cases reported on Sunday include one each from Loni, Khoda and Indirapuram, five from Vasundhara, two from Surya Nagar and two staff of MMG Hospital. The district has witnessed nine deaths due to coronavirus disease.“The 28 patients out of 32 are already in quarantine facility and they will be shifted to dedicated Covid hospital,” said Gupta, the CMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-covid-19-cases-rise-ghaziabad-faces-shortage-of-beds-at-l1-hospital/story-kmlWqQzCZW1qImFwIX7LUJ.html
07-06-2020||Gurugram||Haryana issues guidelines for reopening hospitality services, owners not ready yet||The Haryana government on Sunday issued guidelines for the reopening of restaurants, hotels and other hospitality services across the state, including Gurugram and Faridabad, with the restriction of hosting only 50% of the guest-limit. According to the guidelines, all commercial establishments can open between 9am and 8pm. The government, however, maintained that shopping malls and places of worship will not reopen in the district till further orders.Officials of the excise department confirmed the issuance of guidelines. “We have received fresh guidelines regarding the reopening of restaurants and pubs. We will follow the guidelines and will ensure that no one is violating the rules and regulations. We will take strict action against anyone found violating these rules and regulations under relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act 2005 and under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code,” HC Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west), said.The directions, which were shared by the district administration, said that restaurants in hotels will be allowed to operate at only 50% capacity. No buffet service will be allowed. Only a la carte (ordering individually on the menu) services will be allowed.The government has not allowed reopening bars in restaurants. Gaming arcades and children play areas (wherever applicable) will remain closed. Also, all workers need to wear masks, the order stipulated.“Deputy commissioners will enforce these directions in their respective districts and violations will be punishable under the disaster management act and sections of the Indian Penal Code,” the order stated.Shopping malls in Gurugram will not be allowed to open due to a rapid increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the district, the order said.However, the government allowed banquet halls to reopen with the option to serve only 50 guests while following social distancing norms.Owners in a fix over restarting operationsThe restaurant owners of the city are not ready to restart their operations despite the government allowing them to do so. According to them, the guidelines are not clear and there are too many restrictions which make resuming business inviable.They said the industry is facing challenges in terms of staffing as most migrant labourers working in areas like Cyber Hub, Sector 29, Sohna Road, and Golf Course Road have left for their homes. The owners added that they are trying to get them back from Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, and West Bengal. There are hardly any stewards, waiters, and chefs available in the city.There are about 300 pubs, bars and restaurants, and about 25 hotels wherein liquor is available as part of dine-in services. All these establishments are shut since March 22, the Janata Curfew day, since the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a lockdown. The industry is seeking the government’s help to tide over their burgeoning losses.“A lack of clarity, time restrictions till 8pm (which means establishments must close much earlier), no alcohol, negligible business because of no footfall (customers are panicked because of the rising number of cases in Delhi and the NCR) will affect the businesses,” Lalit Ahlawat, the director of Soi Hospitality in CyberHub, said, adding that the impact was visible across the industry.Inderjeet Banga, the owner of Prankster and Pirates of Grill and chapter head of Gurugram National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said that all owners want to reopen their restaurants, but with so many restrictions of timing, the 50% occupancy rule and, most importantly, bars being closed, they won’t be able to achieve over 15% to 20% of their original sales. “In such scenarios, with no support of landlords, restaurants shall bleed to permanent death. Hence, we request the government to give us time until 11pm, at least, to begin with so we survive,” he said.Most bars and restaurants have paid an annual licence fee in lakhs, they owe rent and are facing huge losses due to the shutdown. The association members have made a representation to the government to refund their license fee for the corresponding period to tide over the losses.Varun Duggal, Head of Alliances at Massive Restaurants Pvt. Ltd., said that reopening restaurants only for food will make them bleed more. “We demand that the timings and rentals be relaxed. We are in discussions with the developers on renegotiating the rentals before we open,” he said.The owners said that they are working on their reopening strategy.“Most of our staff has left for their hometowns. We don’t want to call our employees back until commuting is a challenge. We will soon start hygienic and safe food delivery and take away options,” Duggal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-issues-guidelines-for-reopening-hospitality-services-owners-not-ready-yet/story-0Sh70hRIdgg4DLxKMWVl5I.html

07-06-2020||Gurugram||Western disturbance exits region, mercury expected to rise||The city witnessed thunderstorms accompanied by scattered showers on Sunday morning as overcast skies prevailed over the sky, a result of another western disturbance passing over northwest India. The temperatures are, however, expected to rise between two to four degrees Celsius in the next few days, while the India Meteorological Department(IMD) has predicted fresh showers after June 11. The maximum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 34.6 degrees, while the minimum temperature stood at 21 degrees. Gurugram’s maximum temperature is expected to rise further and touch 38 degrees Celsius on Monday, as per IMD’s weekly forecast. The minimum temperature is expected to hover around 24 degrees on Monday.“The western disturbance affecting northwest India will now begin moving eastward, and its impact will begin to reduce. Strong surface winds, between 25 to 35kmph, will prevail over the Delhi-NCR region in the coming days,” said Kuldeep Srivastava, spokesperson, IMD. Srivastava also said that temperatures over the next week are unlikely to cross 40 degrees Celsius. “Due to light rain and cloudiness over the region, heatwave conditions in Delhi-NCR will not prevail until June 15,” he said.However, the formation of a low-pressure zone in the Bay of Bengal, expected to occur around June 10 (before beginning its movement toward Madhya Pradesh), will bring moisture-laden winds to Delhi-NCR via Uttar Pradesh. “Gusty winds of up to 50 to 60kmph speed, along with thunderstorm and light rain, are expected during the between June 11 evening and June 13, with peak activity on June 12,” Srivastava said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/western-disturbance-exits-region-mercury-expected-to-rise/story-W3F8OBlQPmS1P9kMuuQXTJ.html
07-06-2020||Gurugram||MCG reopens parks after two months; fitness enthusiasts welcome move||Over two months after they were closed down due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak and the nationwide lockdown, the 793 parks in the city operated by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), reopened their gates for residents on Sunday.Despite an early morning rain, morning walkers, yoga enthusiasts, and people looking to exercise could be spotted in the parks with many saying this was the first time they were stepping outside their residential complexes since March 22, when the parks were closed by the MCG due to the Covid-19 outbreak.“As a senior citizen, I had restricted myself to staying indoors during the outbreak and had to give up on my morning stroll, which was a part of my daily routine. An acquaintance told me yesterday that parks will reopen from Sunday and although I was initially reluctant to step out, I changed my mind when I saw from my balcony that there were some people my age who were walking in the park. I interacted face-to-face with people other than my family for the first time in months, although we were all wearing masks and had to communicate from a distance,” said Rajinder Yadav, a resident of Sector 5.Yoga enthusiasts, meanwhile, said that they wanted to use this opportunity to start preparing for National Yoga Day on June 21.“My friends and I have been doing yoga at our respective homes ever since the lockdown. The feeling of practising it together though was a completely different experience. A few of us got together in a park near Galleria market and started practising yoga while maintaining the requisite social distance. We have around two weeks of regular practice left,” said Rohit Aggarwal, a resident of DLF-4.MCG officials said that they will be monitoring all parks, along with residents’ welfare association (RWAs), regularly to ensure that social distancing measures are being adopted.“We have decided to open parks as it gives residents an opportunity to keep themselves fit and healthy, which is extremely important amid the Covid-19 outbreak. MCG officials, as well as RWAs, have been directed to ensure residents maintain social distancing and wear masks all the time,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.The MCG directly maintains 310 parks in the city while RWAs have the responsibility of overseeing 483 parks.Over the last three months, MCG had pasted stickers across gates of all parks in the city stating that entry is forbidden and a breach would lead to action being initiated against the violator for disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-reopens-parks-after-three-months-fitness-enthusiasts-welcome-move/story-YYh4l9zLs5uFVPGUlFTs2L.html
07-06-2020||Gurugram||Search on for Covid-19 patients who had given false info, legal action on the cards||Taking cognisance of the fact that 19 persons who had tested positive for coronavirus in Faridabad had given false details — wrong phone numbers, addresses and names — the district administration has asked the police to trace such patients and initiate legal action against them. The issue came to the notice of the health department, as officials could not contact them after they were found to be positive.On Sunday, Faridabad reported 106 new positive Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 771 in the district, with 14 deaths. Three deaths — two men and a woman, all aged 65 — were reported on Sunday due to multiple co-morbidities.Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner, Faridabad, said such issues cause panic among residents and lead to the spread of the virus. “It is important to take action against such people, who are a threat to society and can be dangerous for others. People who have tested positive should immediately be placed under isolation and samples of their close contacts have to be collected,” he said.Yadav, saying that they pose a “public health risk”, appealed to them to come forward.The deputy commissioner further said, “We had sent the samples of 14,732 people (for testing), of which 771 had tested positive and the results of 960 are awaited. At least 231 people are currently hospitalised.”The infected people have been admitted to the ESIC hospital, officials said, adding that at least 12,729 people are under home quarantine in the district and 10,638 people are on surveillance for influenza-like illnesses.KK Rao, the commissioner of police, Faridabad, said, “We want to reiterate to people that they have to give their real name, correct mobile phone number and an emergency contact at the hospital,” he said.Rao said it is important to trace close contacts and travel history of the positive cases. Not being able to trace those who have tested positive or those who have been in close contact with positive cases is a serious problem, he said.The police has directed all hospitals, private and government, and labs to verify the mobile numbers before taking the samples. If anyone is found giving false information, officials should immediately inform the police control room.Rao said they have received several complaints and have traced more than 15 such people, but it becomes difficult in some cases. “We will start registering cases starting Monday against such anti-social elements and strict action will be taken against them for endangering lives of others,” he said.Around 2,000,000 residents of Faridabad, including 100,000 senior citizens were surveyed to identify those who are most vulnerable to contract Sars-CoV-2 (the virus that causes Covid-19) last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/search-on-for-covid-19-patients-who-had-given-false-info-legal-action-on-the-cards/story-g8ZSIr6fWWyEMFCsbeUepO.html
07-06-2020||City||On the lines of Delhi, city to have SOPs for private hospitals treating Covid-19 cases||Gurugram: The district administration is likely to issue standard operating procedures (SOPs) for private and government-run hospitals in the city for the clinical management of patients of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease by June 9, on the lines of the Delhi government’s guidelines for the same. Officials said that the SOPs have to be followed by all hospitals for streamlining the handling of suspected and confirmed patients of the SARS-CoV-2 virus.“The SOPs have been prepared and will be issued by Tuesday,” said Vivek Kalia, the designated officer for the supervision of health facilities for beds and ventilator management in the district. “They include how a patient has been attended to in the hospital and reasons for hospitalising or not hospitalising the patient. Even if the patient requires critical care or a separate bed for isolation, the SOPs will cover everything, from the time a patient reaches the hospital to the time of their discharge,” he said.The national capital had issued its SOPs on June 5. Currently, at least 921 beds have been reserved for Covid-19 patients across the 23 private and government-run hospitals in the city, out of which as many as 676 beds were vacant till June 5, said Kalia. While the total number of beds available in Gurugram for both Covid and non-Covid patients are as many as 3,399. However, the state government is dependent upon private hospitals for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.In a meeting held with representatives of 15 private hospitals on Sunday, officials inquired about the issues faced by them. “As part of the SOPs, hospitals will have to share the reasons for not admitting patients. A written log has to be created, citing reasons. Apparently, only critical or those having coronavirus symptoms have to be admitted to hospitals,” said Kalia.Notably, the district administration had issued notices earlier this week to three private hospitals for refusing to take patients. Instances have been reported where pregnant Covid-19-positive women were denied treatment.The meeting with hospital representatives was taken by Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited’s (GMCBL) chief executive officer Sonal Goel, who is also the in-charge of supervision of health facilities for beds and ventilator management. It was decided in the meeting that there has to be separate counters for Covid-19 cases at the hospitals, where the name and number of the hospital supervisor designated by the hospital has to be displayed, including the fees being charged by them.Officials also said that an online portal has been created in association with the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) where beds availability and occupancy details of the admitted patients will be made available on a realtime basis. For this, six volunteers have been deputed to coordinate with the hospitals for data, which will be updated twice a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/on-the-lines-of-delhi-city-to-have-sops-for-private-hospitals-treating-covid-19-cases/story-sgcYI40RE9IvQuilNVdFSL.html
07-06-2020||City||Gurugram admin to create database of Covid-19 patients||Gurugram: The district administration is creating a centralized real-time database of all Covid-19 patients. Officials said that a digital application is being developed that will be used to integrate all the data of a Covid-19 patient, starting from the day a person is tested positive to hospitalization or home isolation, tracing his/her high-risk contacts and the day of discharge.As the Covid-19 cases are rapidly increasing in the Gurugram, data management of such patients and their high-risk contacts has emerged as a critical issue. The officials said that the data duplicity has been reported in the past, and now the application would prevent all sorts of discrepancies.“An application is being developed that would help create database of Covid-19 cases in an integrated manner. It is for real-time database management. All the details of a person tested positive for coronavirus will be fed into the application. Details of the people with whom the patient has been in contact will also be included to help the teams who will be contacting them,” said Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner.Sangwan said that the urban primary health centres (PHCs) have been collating the data which is currently fragmented. “This data needs to be integrated to understand the prevalence of infection and control its transmission,” he said.According to him, the application will be used across the board in different PHCs, community health centres (CHCs) and various government offices, who are assigned different roles. “The application would be entirely functional in the next few days,” he said.Recently, the administration divided all crucial tasks related to Covid-19 like collecting lab reports, contact tracing, timely hospitalisation/home isolation among at least 14 officials of different government departments. The details collected by the health team deployed at the ground level to conduct surveillance and contact tracing of positive patients will be first fed into the application. It will be further modified based on the calls made by the call centre set up by the Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran and the district administration, which are assigned the task of monitoring the health of high-risk contacts of a positive patient. During the monitoring, if a suspected case is traced and admitted to a hospital, then the team designated for bed capacity and ventilator management will add their inputs. Even when the patient is discharged after treatment, those details will also be added, the officials said. Notably, to streamline the Covid-19 reporting, the district administration has already divided the city into seven zones, including five in the city and two in Sohna and Pataudi. As per the plans shared by the officials, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), which has been assigned to liaison with private and government labs for test results, will segregate the test reports based on the areas falling under different zones. The nodal officer for each of these zones will coordinate with the health team of PHC or CHC of that area to reach the affected patient at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-admin-to-create-database-of-covid-19-patients/story-skkbcYr76IKcSvhpj93iIJ.html

This case has been registered under sections 307 (murder bid), 379-B (theft by force) and 447 (criminal trespass) of the IPC and relevant sections of the Arms Act at the Bhikhiwind police station.The complainant, Baba Gurbachan Singh’s follower Narbir Singh, said after the death of Baba Daya Singh, 103 acres of land were being tilled by Baba Gurbachan, while the rest was being looked after by the sect head.He said, “Baba Daya Singh had distributed the total land equally between both his sons. However, Baba Avtar had been claiming that the land belonged to him as he is the sect’s head. Baba Gurbachan had already procured a stay order from court regarding the tilling of the land. On Saturday, the followers of Baba Avtar forcibly tilled the land situated in Bhikhiwind. They also attacked the followers of Baba Gurbachan and snatched their vehicles at gunpoint.”The second case has been registered on Narbir’s complaint at Chabhal police station against Baba Avtar’s 54 followers under sections 341, 323, 506, 148 and 149 of the IPC.Satnam Singh, an assistant of Baba Avtar, said the land was donated by the sangat to the sect and it is not the property of the family. He said the sect head would soon conduct a press conference to clear the issue.The sect (a Nihang jathedbandi), which has around 80 gurdwaras in Punjab and dozens in other states and foreign countries, is headquartered in Sursingh village falling under Bhikhiwind sub-division of the district.

07-06-2020||Chandigarh||Govt forced Sikhs to pick arms in 1984: Akal Takht jathedar||A day after courting a controversy over his remarks in favour of Khalistan as a separate Sikh state, Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on Sunday said it was the Indian government that forced members of the community to pick arms in 1984. In a message relayed on a web channel, which was recently banned in India for its alleged anti-national content, the jathedar while referring to the Operation Bluestar said that “picking arms was the last resort for the Sikhs for getting their demands heard by the government”. “We should ascertain as to why the Sikhs picked arms. When India got independence in 1947, the country’s leaders made some promises to the Sikhs such as giving them due respect and rights besides safeguarding their principles and traditions. But then, the Sikhs were tagged as a “criminal community” instead of delivering these promises,” the head priest of temporal seat said.He said, “As if this was not enough, police personnel were made to enter the Golden Temple in 1955 with shoes. This was the first incident of sacrilege in the shrine in free India, which hurt the Sikhs. The government supplied Punjab’s river water to other states in violation of the norms. This paved the way for destruction of Sikhs in Punjab and angered them.” “Sikhs had to wage a struggle for the formation of a Punjabi-speaking state to safeguard their mother tongue. Many were killed while agitating in Delhi in support of their demand. When members of the community opted for an armed struggle, the government used forces to repress them. These atrocities continued well beyond 1984,” he added.The jathedar was not available for comments over his giving a message on via banned web channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/govt-forced-sikhs-to-pick-arms-in-1984-akal-takht-jathedar/story-QARLycI888jY8Bmb9851cO.html

07-06-2020||Chandigarh||Strictly adhere to safety protocols: Capt||Punjab Chief Minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Sunday appealed to the people to adhere to the safety protocols and restrictions to save themselves, their families and the state.He said the state had adequate essential equipment to manage further spread of the pandemic, which it had been largely able to control so far and the focus was on saving lives.Responding to questions during the latest FB Live edition of #AskCaptain, the CM said the Covid situation in Punjab had so far been manageable due to the strict lockdown and people’s cooperation. On Friday alone, 4,600 challans had been imposed for failure to wear mask in public, 160 for spitting and around two-dozen for not adhering to social distancing norms. Such irresponsible behaviour could not be permitted as it could push Punjab on the same path as many other states, he added.The CM said with 2,608 total positive cases, of which 2,106 had recovered, Punjab’s situation had been under control so far. Fifty-one people had died of the infection. A total of 1,24,266 samples had been tested, and only 451 persons had to be put in isolation, with just three persons having to be placed on oxygen and another three on ventilator since the outbreak of the pandemic in the state, said Amarinder.Despite this, however, the state government was not taking any chances, said Amarinder. In the first stage, 4,248 beds in government hospitals had been set aside, with another 2,014 now being added, while the private hospitals had allocated 950 beds for Covid-19 patients, he said. The total number of isolation centres identified to accommodate a large number of cases if the crisis aggravates stands at 52 government and 195 private, he added.Of the 554 ventilators available, only one was in use, as of Saturday, he said , adding that in addition to the equipment already handed over to hospitals and other frontline workers, the health department had stocks of 4,88,000 N95 masks, 64 lakh triple layer masks, 2,28,000 PPE kits and 2,223 oxygen cylinders.On problems faced in paddy sowing due to the shortage of migrant labour, the CM said that less than 5 lakh of the total 13 lakh migrant labourers in Punjab had left the state. With over eight lakh migrant workers still here, along with the state’s own local labour, there were no problems in the field or in the industrial units, he said.On the issue of private schools charging fees for the lockdown period, the CM said the state government will go in appeal against the high court ruling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/strictly-adhere-to-safety-protocols-capt/story-SU1oK4EZAnARbCYjLxBrpI.html

Moose Wala has another case registered against him in Sangrur. Garg will now supervise investigation in both the First Information Reports (FIRs). The two cases relate to firing from a police assault rifle at a shooting range at Badbar village of Barnala on May 4, and another instance of firing from a pistol/revolver at the Ladda Kothi shooting range of Sangrur on May 5.“I have decided to handover the supervision of both the cases to one SSP. However, SPs of Barnala and Sangrur will continue their investigation independently,” Aulakh told HT.“Both the SPs probing the cases will now report to me. Sidhu Moose Wala has been booked under non-bailable offences and will be arrested soon,” SSP Garg told HT.Punjab Bureau of Investigation (PBI) SP Rupinder Bhardwaj is heading the probe into the Barnala case, while SP Gurmeet Singh is leading the Sangrur probe. SP Bhardwaj said a notice has been sent to the singer to appear at his office on June 12. In the Barnala case, a case was registered under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant) of the IPC and Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act at Dhanauala police station against nine persons, including Moose Wala and some cops. On May 18, sections of the Arms Act were added to the FIR. Eight police personnel, including DSP Daljit Singh Virk, Julkan SHO Gurpreet Singh Bhinder and three assistant sub-inspectors, were suspended. On June 2, a Barnala court dismissed the anticipatory bail plea of six cops, including Jangsher Singh, son of DSP Daljit Singh Virk. Jangsher, however, got anticipatory bail from Punjab and Haryana high court on June 5.In the May 5 firing incident, the Sangrur police booked Moose Wala and six cops at Sadar Dhuri police station under Section 188 of the IPC and Arms act. A Sangrur court, however, granted them anticipatory bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sangrur-ssp-to-supervise-both-firing-cases-against-moose-wala/story-Uvcvz8oL4uMwlM7hM0zT9J.html
07-06-2020||Chandigarh||PPCB fines Zirakpur builder Rs 84 lakh for environmental violations||Mohali: The Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has imposed a fine of Rs 84 lakh for environmental violations on Barnala Builders who own the commercial project Maya Magnesia in Singhpura village of Zirakpur.The violations include non renewal of no objection certificate (NOC) related to pollution and disposal of septic tank waste, it has been learnt.The PPCB said that the NOC for pollution acquired by the builder on November 23, 2016, for development of the four acre project was valid only up to November 22, 2017, with certain conditions. But the builder, despite show cause notices, had not applied for extension to the Board under the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, and the Air (Prevention and Control of pollution ) Act, 1981. PPCB officials who had visited the site in January detected a number of violations. Six borewells were being used to extract groundwater to stop the outflow/seepage in the basement area. Domestic effluent generated from the washroom used by 120 labourers was being discharged in a septic tank (installed by the builder in 2018) and thereafter lifted by using a tanker to be disposed of at an undisclosed location, in violation of the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and the conditions of the expired NOC.“The act and conduct of the promoter company relating to the disposal of wastewater of the septic tank to an unknown place by using a tanker during the period from July 1, 2018, up to the date of making the statement on January 21, 2020, is a serious violation of the provisions of the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974, in the furtherance of degrading the environment,” a PPCB statement said.The board asked the builder to deposit the fine within 15 days, failing which necessary action would be taken to recover it.Even after repeated attempts, however, Satish Jindal, managing director of the project did not respond to calls or messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ppcb-fines-zirakpur-builder-rs-84-lakh-for-environmental-violations/story-kkunmNKacnNlujmQH5tajI.html

07-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh hospital told to seek consent before referring patients to PGIMER emergency ward||Struggling with the huge rush of patients at the emergency ward, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has asked hospitals under the jurisdiction of Chandigarh health department to seek consent before referring patients to the institute.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said this is a precautionary measure taken in view of the heavy rush of patients at the institute.“We need to develop a system through which hospitals can arrive upon a decision on referrals after mutual consultations. We have taken up the matter with the UT health department and administration officials at different levels,” said Dr Jagat Ram.He added that sometimes when critical patients are referred to the institute, there are no ventilators available, which makes it a life-threatening situation. “If we are aware of the incoming patients, we can make timely arrangements for them,” he said.Earlier, PGIMER had written to the neighbouring states, asking them to seek permission before referring patients to the institute.In view of the increasing rush, PGIMER had set up 30 cubicles each at the emergency ward and advanced trauma centre to ensure social distancing between the patients. “This has eaten up a lot of space but we are still accommodating patients and trying our best to treat them,” said Dr Ram said. He said that before the lockdown, PGIMER saw an average footfall of around 250 to 300 persons at the emergency ward and advanced trauma centre everyday. The number has now increased to around 400 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-hospital-told-to-seek-consent-before-referring-patients-to-pgimer-emergency-ward/story-JEQsPI42CnQ0mfPdQtG5qI.html
07-06-2020||Dehradun||War of words over CM Covid Relief Fund breaks out in Uttarakhand||Uttarakhand Congress has demanded that the BJP-led state government make the accounts of Chief Minister COVID Relief Fund public to prove that the fund has been utilised properly.The demand was made by Congress state vice president Suryakant Dhasmana while attacking the state government over its handling of the ongoing pandemic in the state. Dhasmana said, “The government has been collecting a significant amount of money through donations in CM Covid Relief Fund from various sections of the society. It announces daily who donated how much to the Fund. But no information regarding where the money is being utilized has come out?”He cited the demands for audit of the PM CARES Fund to seek transparency from the state government.“As all have seen how the Centre is sternly opposing the demand of revealing the details of the PM CARES Fund in which it collected thousands of crores from the public in the name of Covid-19 relief, we also doubt the transparency in this CM Covid Relief Fund. The state government should immediately disclose the total amount of money collected and its expenditure so far,” said Dhasmana. The Congress leader also demanded to know if Uttarakhand had received “its share” from the PM CARES Fund. “The ONGC which is headquartered in Uttarakhand had donated about Rs 300 cr in the PM CARES Fund but not in CM Relief Fund as the Centre had said that all Central PSUs will donate to Centre, not the state. Then, Uttarakhand should get a share of ONGC’s donation. The CM should speak out on it as people have every right to know about it,” said Dhasmana. He also attacked the state government for allegedly “surrendering” in the fight against the pandemic as positive cases grow in numbers. “It has completely surrendered in the fight and has told the public to look after themselves, which is evident in its recent actions. When the cases are increasing every day, it has decided to reopen schools and religious places, which is just ridiculous,” said Dhasmana, adding, the situation is so worrisome that the state high court had to intervene.The state BJP hit back at the Congress alleging it was busy doing politics over the pandemic from the day one. “Congress has been shamelessly doing politics on this pandemic from the first day. On the other hand, the state government and the BJP have been helping the needy in every possible way, including with ration and medicines. Congress is nowhere to be seen as far as helping the people is concerned; it is busy in dirty politics in this crisis situation,” said Ajendra Ajay, BJP state spokesperson.On the demand for making the accounts of CM Covid Relief Fund public, Ajay said the demand was baseless.“Whenever the Congress is in power either at the Centre or in state, it has been involved in corruption, unlike the BJP, where no leader including the PM has been accused in even a single case of corruption. As Congress themselves are deeply in corruption, they suspect everyone of doing the same. There is no irregularity either in the PM CARES Fund or CM COVID Relief Fund.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/dehradun/war-of-words-over-cm-covid-relief-fund-breaks-out-in-uttarakhand/story-HDu5wdp516BkfEKp2DnwhI.html

Small traders, including shopkeepers, hardware sellers, and professionals such as photographers and barbers have been affected the most. A cycle shop owner has already committed suicide and there is a sense of utter despair among the trading community at large,” Sharma said.The SAD spokesperson said it was incumbent on the government to provide a healing touch in this hour of crisis. “The least it can do is give relief where possible by allowing the industry and trade sector to retain the state GST share for three months,” demanded Sharma.He said there was resentment among people that instead of providing financial aid where needed, the Congress government had given a relief of ₹673 crore to liquor contractors and ₹150 crore to the sand mafia. This is the reason why nearly 32,000 industrial units have not restarted their operations yet, he said.Sharma assured the traders that the party would raise their voice at appropriate forums, including the governor to force the Congress government to resolve their grievances and extend due relief to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-demands-waiver-of-fixed-power-charges-for-industrial-sector/story-E4YfWYp6uYKqq809YYR2ZJ.html

The comments are also aimed to push the miscreants to cause public disorder in the society,” the statement said adding that case has been lodged under the relevant sections of law. “Further investigation has been initiated in the case,” the statement said.Last month the HC had asked incarcerated Qayoom if he would like to shun his ‘secessionist’ ideology and then left it to the government to take a decision after such a representation.While dismissing an appeal by Qayoom against his detention under Public Safety Act, the division bench of the court comprising justices Vinod Chatterji Koul and Ali Mohammad Magrey endorsed the stand of advocate general that the FIRs and the grounds of detention against Qayoom depict and relate to the secessionist ideology of the detainee.“While addressing his arguments on the ideology nourished and nurtured by the detainee, the learned advocate general submitted that such ideology cannot be confined or limited to time to qualify it to be called stale or fresh or proximate, unless, of course, the person concerned declares and establishes by conduct and expression that he has shunned the ideology (emphasis supplied),” the court had said.The justices also had left it to the discretion of the government or the concerned authorities to take a decision in terms of the relevant provision(s) of the J&K PSA on any such representation, if made, by the detainee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/psa-against-j-k-bar-association-chief-police-register-fir-over-social-media-criticism-of-hc-verdict/story-dmOPQ0jTjHlBNt7PRI0sGK.html

In this regard, the health department is also receiving verbal complaints that challans have been issued for not wearing masks in car, which is a violation of government’s order, as per which, people will be fined for not wearing masks in public places only. Therefore, you should direct the officials and officers to stick to that.”“The motive behind writing to the SSP is to highlight the need of sensitisation among police personnel, who are responsible for implementation of government’s order,” Dr Malhotra said.HEALTH DEPT SENSATIONALISING ISSUE, SAYS SSPThe issue has brought the police and health departments at loggerheads now.Responding to the civil surgeon’s letter, SSP Sidhu advised him to revisit the notification of health and family welfare department and refrain from sensationalism.“Punjab health services director in a notification dated May 15 had declared that every person travelling by a vehicle should be wearing a mask. In the same notification, it has been said that those found without masks will be fined ₹200, which was enhanced to ₹500 on May 29,” the SSP said.On civil surgeon’s claim that in the revised advisory there was no mention of the said challan, the SSP said, “The revised advisory is not stand-alone and was issued in continuation of earlier advisory.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-cops-fine-woman-doctor-patiala-health-dept-says-driving-car-sans-mask-no-violation/story-46slbzsfsOo3im6kX0WuKM.html

Only containment areas are under lockdown now,” said Kadam.Kothrud has seen, relatively, fewer number of Covid positive cases compared to other areas in the city. As of June 4, Kothrud had 23 active cases out of 46 progressive cases.The areas comprising Mhatobdhara, Sutardhara, Kishkinda nagar and Jaibhavani nagar had been facing restrictions in the aftermath of the lockdown.According to officials, on Saturday evening, a 68-year-old woman passed away at her residence in Sutardhara due to prolonged illness. However, her family faced difficulty in transportation from the house to the hospital due to a tin sheet that was blocking the opening of the lane. Nearby residents came to their rescue and forcibly removed the tin sheets. This incident prompted the administration and also the elected representatives to take up the issue on a priority basis and action was taken.PMC corporator Deepak Mankar said that the area has been under lockdown for nearly months and some residents had lost their livelihood. “They need to step out for work and keeping the area closed was not appropriate,” he said.Sandeep Waghmare, an autorickshaw driver from Sutardhara said, “We don’t have any work and with restrictions, it was difficult to step out. Despite the lockdown conditions being eased, the situation in our area and surroundings was still the same as the roads were blocked.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/kothrud-s-internal-roads-open-for-public/story-w9AJHu92B9EIcKzMucLqWI.html
07-06-2020||City||Reopening of temples may take little longer as HP officials await SOPs||Reopening of temples in Himachal Pradesh may take a little longer up to the second week of June as the state authorities are yet to issue standard operating procedures (SOPs) and conduct training of staff for implementation of those guidelines. The Centre has allowed opening religious places from June 8— the first phase of Unlock 1.0— and SOPs in this regard were issued by the ministry of health and family welfare on June 4. However, the state is yet to come up with SOPs. Himachal Pradesh has some major Hindu shrines which are visited by lakhs of pilgrims every year from all over the country.Temples were closed for the public on March 17 to thwart the spread of novel coronavirus. “We are in no hurry to open the temples. I will hold a meeting with all the temple SDMs tomorrow in this regard,” said Kangra deputy commissioner Rakesh Kumar Prajapati.He said that the language art and culture department of the state government will soon be issuing the guidelines to be implemented in the temple premises.Next week we are conducting the training of staff, priests, guards and shopkeepers around the temples for implementation of SOPs, he said.“So, temples may open next week or maybe after that,” said Prajapati adding that the temple trust has enough funds to pay their staff.Kangra has famous shrines including Jawalaji, Chamunda, Brajeshwari Devi, Baijnath, Mahakal and Baglamukhi. All of the temples in the district, except Baglamukhi temple, are under government control.Meanwhile, the Chintpurni Temple in Una district will also remain closed that till guidelines are issued in this regard.Local traders and the priests have hailed the district administration’s decision.The Baba Balak Nath Temple and Naina Devi shrine would also keep their doors shut.Temple tourism is an important part of the economy of Himachal Pradesh. The economy of towns like Baijnath, Jawalamukhi, Kangra remains dependent on visiting pilgrims.However, since the lockdown, the income of these temples has come to naught.Hotels to remain shut as wellMeanwhile, the hoteliers in the state have also refused to operate from Monday. They are of the view that that opening the hotels without tourists will cause them huge losses.Shimla Hotel and Restaurant Association President Sanjay Sood said that there was no point in opening the hotels. “What would we earn when the tourist is not allowed in the state,” said Sood. He said that the peak season was already gone so they will keep the hotels shut.McLeodganj Hotel and Restaurant Association President Ashwini Bamba said that that they have already decided to keep the hotels shut till June 30.Private buses to remain off-roadPrivate bus operators have also refused to ply their buses. State Private Bus Operator Association’s general secretary Ramesh Kamal said that they were suffering losses as there were no passengers. He said that the government should help private operators or increase the bus fare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/reopening-of-temples-may-take-little-longer-as-hp-officials-await-sops/story-NOy56QdPwb1jmXVhRPUebJ.html

07-06-2020||Pune||YourSpace: Labourers must be treated with respect, say readers||Fixed-term employment, a long-term solutionMigration is a reality. It is about states having different levels of demand-supply gaps for labourers, especially the unskilled or semi-skilled labourers that are large in numbers. There is a significant migration of labour from northern and eastern belts to the southern and western belts of India. There is also a large migration from Marathwada, Vidarbha and Konkan to Mumbai, Pune and other parts of western Maharashtra. These are all functions of intrastate and interstate regional imbalances of economic growth and there will continue to be large migrations for employment till we achieve balanced regional growth. Most labourers whether from out-of-state or from within, work as temporary workers and hence have almost no social security. A wider adoption of ‘fixed-term employment’ (FTE) contracts directly with employers as against the current practice of a labour contractor and will ensure higher social security for labourers. FTE should be acceptable to employers as it is not about taking liability for lifetime, even beyond life of business. I am all fine for calling them guest workers as against migrant workers, if that helps the cause, but I am keener to advocate for legal frameworks and safety nets that are sustainable, one example being above mentioned ‘FTE’. -Prashant GirbaneLabourers treated unfairlyWhat’s in a name? It’s how we treat them that matters. Are they being looked at as human beings or as cut pieces of lemon - to be squeezed as long as they have juice and then chucked away? If they can make a decent living in cities, why would they want to go home? Can’t we give them homes where they work? How many who built our houses have a roof over their heads?-Ravindranath ChandranMust address labourers as workersAll the labourers must be called as workers and this is the most common denomination for their recognition in the society. The central government had sanctioned and implemented the Social Security Act in 2008 and it gives crystal guidelines for considering all labourers as workers. They must be addressed as only workers and not by another identity.-Baba AdhavCitizens, not migrantsNo. I don’t agree with both the words, migrants or guests. They are the citizens of this country and that’s it.-Mahesh ZagadeNeed for sympathy towards poorKerala government has given migrant workers a lot of dignity and went out of the way in helping them in the times of crisis. This is one of the most outstanding methods of giving dignity to the working class of India. The rest of the countrymen and also the ruling class of India must learn how to respect these workers. The government is negligent to the cause of the masses and the classes. It is interested only in serving the rich class through crony capitalism. The current dispensation is against the people and anti-human nature. We need a complete overhaul of the system and need new persons who are sympathetic to the cause of the poor.-BJ Kerkar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/yourspace-labourers-must-be-treated-with-respect-say-readers/story-SqwIym0ReA7lVrNv1iJFtN.html

Taking care of them became an issue as the lockdown hampered the movement of its 70 caretakers.That is when Shalini Suresh Wadkar a 29-year-old caretaker with Shreevatsa, decided to stay at the itself rather than go home and be away from work. She was among the 25 caretakers who stayed at the child care centre for 15 days at a stretch.Working at Shreevatsa for the last 10 years, Shalini, a mother of three children, began staying at the centre for 15 days and then going home for a week. She received full support from her family while adapting to this new, demanding schedule.However, this was not just a job for Shalini who went out of her way to care for these children.Recently when one of the new born babies had some health issues and needed to be hospitalised, this caretaker voluntarily came forward to stay with the baby in the hospital for 24 hours. “For the next one week she was with that baby in the hospital, just as a mother would have done, till it was cured and discharged. She would give me a daily report about the baby’s recovery,” said Sharmila Sayed, administration in-charge at Sofosh.About this incident Shalini said it was on May 7 that this baby was admitted to a nearby private hospital and she immediately volunteered to stay with it. “I felt it was unsafe to leave the baby alone at the hospital,” she said. On one occasion when she was not allowed to go inside the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) because she was not the mother, Shalini insisted that “she was as good as the baby’s mother and she wanted to go in like the other mothers who were being allowed inside.” Finally, the nurses relented and she was allowed.“I just wanted my baby to recover fast and bring it back home to our centre,” she said.Upon their return, both she and the baby had to stay in isolation for a week as they had returned from a hospital.“During this period I would video-call my children and speak to them,” she said.Sayed recalled that a year ago Shalini had given birth to her own baby. When she re-joined duty, she breast-fed not just her own chid but, with permission, also a premature baby at the centre.”Hailing from a lower-middle-class family, Shalini is married to an autorickshaw driver who has lost his earnings due to the lockdown. The family is now solely dependent on her income with her husband and parents taking care of her three children when she is away at the child care centre.“I have two daughters and a son at home and my family is very supportive of my work. Because of them I am able to stay at the centre and work round the clock for my other children who are at the child care centre. These children need us and we have a different bonding with them. When I am at the centre staying with them, I am completely immersed in my work as this also is my family,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/caretaker-overcomes-lockdown-hurdles-to-look-after-destitute-infants-in-pune/story-f9JnoaZHdfEmDIdOV0zOXK.html

07-06-2020||Patna||Political parties gear up for upcoming Bihar Assembly polls||With Bihar Legislative Assembly elections just months away, political parties have started preparations for the impending contest. Due to the coronavirus outbreak, political quarters are taking a virtual turn and are banking on social media platforms to reach out to voters.Union Home Minister Amit Shah is scheduled to launch the Bharatiya Janata Party’s election campaign in the state virtually. The party has chosen Bihar BJP Facebook and YouTube pages for the live streaming to reach out to the people residing in the 243 Assembly segments of the state.“On June 7, Amit Shah will be addressing party workers that will be live-streamed at 60,000 booths that have internet connectivity. Regular rallies came to a halt due to the pandemic, which will be resumed now with help of digital medium,” Bihar BJP President Sanjay Jaiswal told ANI.Meanwhile, the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) will observe ‘Garib Adhikar Diwas’ to counter Shah’s rally. Recently, Tejashwi Yadav attacked the BJP for campaigning stating, “BJP is the richest party in the country as well as in the world and “it only cares for rich people and not the poor”.Also read: RJD launches protest ahead of Amit Shah’s virtual rally in Bihar“This party (BJP) is calling migrants workers goons. We will celebrate Garib Adhikar Diwas today in protest,” said RJD spokesman Mrityunjay Tiwari while speaking to ANI.Notably, the poster war has also started in the state. The Janata Dal-United (JDU) in the morning pasted posters depicting RJD leader and former Chief Minister Lalu Prasad Yadav in jail at Income Tax and Dak Bungalow crossroads in Patna to oppose ‘Garib Adhikar Diwas.’Posters featuring Lalu Prasad Yadav and Mohammad Shahabuddin banging ‘thalis’ inside the jail. The slogans on these posters read ‘Kaidi baja raha thali, janata bajao taali’ in an apparent jibe at the two RJD leaders serving terms in prison.“Tejashwi Prisoner no 3351 (Lalu Yadav) who is lodged in Hotwar Jail will today bang the plates from the prison and people will clap today,” said Niraj Kumar of JDU and added, “Tejashwi is the king of corruption who is 8th pass. He copies Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Nitish Kumar in politics.”BJP, JD(U) and Lok Janshakti Party are part of the NDA in Bihar and are likely to be challenged by an alliance of the RJD and the Congress besides some smaller political parties in the upcoming Assembly elections.In the 2015 Assembly Elections, the NDA was defeated by the grand alliance of the RJD-JD(U)-Congress. However, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar later broke ties with his allies in 2017 and entered in an alliance with the BJP again after a gap of over four years.

They think no one will crosscheck and they will carry on with their falsehood. But at whose expense, at the expense of the common man.” He said the government is not involving Indian Council of Medical Research in the testing process and vested everything on the health department “so that the real truth doesn’t come out.” “In these circumstances, we demand the state government come out with a white paper on the total number of active Covid-19 cases, the total number of deaths caused by the virus, the total number of tests done every day, the time taken to get the results for tests - everything. If the real figures come out, we will know about the actual situation,” the MP said.Ghosh also accused Banerjee of giving conflicting figures about the total affected people in Cyclone Amphan.“Initially she said 3 lakh people were affected by the cyclone. She revised that to 5 lakh within a few days. Now she is saying the devastation affected lives of not more than 8 lakh people. This means she is raising the figure to get more central help. Why should the Centre trust her,” he asked.The BJP leader also asked what is happening to the foodgrains quota for 450 fair price ration shops, which were shut down after corruption charges were proved against these dealers. “Are the foodgrains quota for these shops being siphoned off,” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/mamata-banerjee-govt-fudging-covid-figures-in-bengal-says-state-s-bjp-chief/story-w4HShIpUSuCepSrgT8FyaJ.html

07-06-2020||Chandigarh||Only one online class a day in Chandigarh govt schools||Chandigarh Students from classes 6 to 8 in Chandigarh’s government schools will now log into only one online class a day during the Covid-19 lockdown period when institutes are closed instead of three subjects as directed earlier, the UT education department has said.“The aim is to ensure that the classes reach as many students as it possibly can,” said a department official privy to the developments on Sunday who did not wish to be named. “There are many students whose parents have just one mobile phone, that they usually have to share with their siblings,” she said.“By holding just one class a day for a stipulated time, we assume that all students can have access to it in a household,” she added.This will also limit screen exposure time, she added.The message sent to school principals informally by the office of the district education officer (DEO) Alka Mehta states that the time table to be followed for online teaching for classes 6 to 8 is: English on Sunday, science on Monday, Hindi on Tuesday. After the first weekly off on Wednesday, math will be taught on Thursday and social studies on Friday, before the second weekly off on Saturday.Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director school education (DSE) said school studies had been adversely affected because of the extended lockdown and long vacations. “The government of India is planning to start schools in July. We have provided the required impetus to online classes by increasing the involvement of teachers,” he said.Authorities will start using school infrastructure for online mode from June15 and submit school wise opening plan through the heads, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/only-one-online-class-a-day-in-chandigarh-govt-schools/story-EE8chibSl15ozxSyKQQPDI.html
07-06-2020||Delhi||Probe into violence unbiased, say cops||Delhi Police registered 750 different first information reports (FIRs) related to the northeast Delhi riots in February and arrested around 1,400 people, including around 620 Hindus and 683 Muslims, the department said on Saturday. The department is releasing data on the religious identity of the arrested suspects because of false reports on social media suggesting that the police probe in the riots was biased and that one community was being targeted, Delhi police spokesperson MS Randhawa said. Police also said that until Saturday morning, the department has filed charge sheets in 79 riot cases, in which 510 people were charged with offences.“The 510 persons charged include 205 Hindus and an equal number of Muslims. The cases are being probed by the local police, crime branch, and the special cell. We are releasing the data in this format because of the misinformation on social media,” said Randhawa.At least 53 people died and 400 were injured when clashes between opponents and supporters of the Citizenship (Amendment) Act acquired a communal colour and turned into rioting between Hindus and Muslims in the northeastern parts of the city in late FebruaryThe police, in submission to the courts, have said that the riots were planned and executed by some activists of the anti-CAA group who held road blockades across the city. The riots in northeast Delhi were triggered by a clash between pro-CAA and anti-CAA groups near the Jafrabad metro station.The police’s special cell, which is probing a suspected larger conspiracy behind the riots, has arrested student leaders, members of the Jamia Coordination Committee and activists and accused them of hatching a conspiracy to start the riots.“We have sufficient evidence to show how these leaders fanned the passion of the citizens by blocking roads. We have messages that they shared, in which they are discussing that riots could break out but continued to hold protests. We are probing the conspiracy and will file a detailed charge sheet later,” said an investigating officer who requested anonymity.Meanwhile, on Saturday, during a hearing on a bail plea by former Jawaharlal Nehru University student Sharjeel Imam, arrested for delivering inflammatory speeches during the anti-CAA protests, the police told the Delhi high court that speeches caused “ communal strife and promoted enmity between various religious groups.” The plea is scheduled to come up for hearing on June 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/probe-into-violence-unbiased-say-cops/story-nV5GOYu7WXwu7R9kiTnJUJ.html

07-06-2020||Lucknow||One held for drawing ₹5 lakh pay from schools||The Uttar Pradesh education department has begun a massive exercise of verifying the documents of 5,000 teachers after a woman suspected to have drawn over ₹5 lakh in salary from multiple schools was arrested in Kasganj on Saturday.The suspect, who police said initially identified herself as Anamika Shukla, taught at the Kasturba Gandhi Balika Vidyalaya (KGBV) at Faridpur in Kasganj. Her alleged crime was discovered after education department authorities discovered her name appearing in more than one school.“She was arrested from the BSA (basic shiksha adhikari) office when she had arrived to resign. A case has been registered at the Soron police station in Kasganj,” said Kasganj additional superintendent of police Pavitra Mohan Tripathi. “When questioned, she said her name was Anamika Shukla but later said it was Priya Singh. These facts are being investigated to ascertain her real identity. In her appointment letter of 2018, her name is Anamika Shukla and she claimed to be a resident of Kayamganj in Farrukhabad.”The arrested woman told the press that she was working at the Faridpur school for the last 18 months. She claimed a person named Raj helped her get the job in exchange for money.Confirming the arrest, basic education minister Satish Chand Dwivedi on Saturday said, “Our findings suggest a sum of ₹2.31 lakh was paid to Anamika in Ambedkar Nagar, ₹1.16 lakh in Saharanpur, ₹93,530 in Aligarh and ₹68,200 in Amethi. This matter came to light after the Yogi government decided to upload details of teachers’ attendance and salary on the web portal to minimise foul practices which had been going on for several decades.”Dwivedi said the database of teachers on the Manav Sampada portal required personal records of teachers. Now, the process of verifying documents of all 5,000 teachers of KGBVs has started to check more such cases, the education department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/one-held-for-drawing-5-lakh-pay-from-schools/story-lQ9lkqWRzg2uLR826fKl8I.html

We asked them to shift. The building is extremely dangerous and we will soon demolish it. We had already served a notice to the building owner to demolish it before the monsoon,” said Kishor Kutade, ward officer, KDMC.“Since it rained, the structure has weakened and some of its portions of the wall fell and tilted a bit,” added Kutade.In Thane, a portion of a balcony at Gupta chawl in Gandhi Nagar, Thane, fell on Saturday. No one was injured in the incident. “The balcony on a one-storey structure at Gupta chawl probably became weak due to heavy showers for the past two days,” said an official from Regional Disaster Management Cell (RDMC), Thane. “The chawl is near Mahatma Gandhi School, Gandhi Nagar, and has many illegal structures. The house whose balcony fell is occupied.

07-06-2020||Chandigarh||Agri ordinances not violative of federal structure: Centre||With the Punjab government targeting the Centre over an ordinance which allows barrier-free trade in the farm sector, Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar on Saturday said the ordinance would not violate the spirit of federal structure in any way.Tomar also slammed opposition parties for creating “illusions” over the minimum support price (MSP) for foodgrain and said the assured price to farmers would continue.“I want to clarify that this ordinance does not violate the spirit of the federal structure. Agriculture is a state subject but the Union government was empowered by the constitution to bring any reform related to agricultural produce. It’s a historical moment for the farmers as change in rules will end the inspector raj,” said Tomar, while addressing reporters here through videoconference.The Union minister’s statement came a day after Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh dubbed the ordinance as “violative” of the federal structure. Captain had also warned that it could pave the way for disbanding the MSP regime as well as the foodgrain procurement regime, triggering unrest among the state’s farmers.The Centre on Friday notified two key ordinances to kick in agriculture reforms and help farmers trade freely and fetch better prices.The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion & Facilitation) Ordinance-2020 allows barrier-free trade in agriculture produce outside the notified APMC (Agriculture Produce Marketing Committees) mandis. It proposes to bar state governments from imposing taxes on sale and purchase of farm produce undertaken outside the mandis and give farmers the freedom to sell their produce at remunerative prices.The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance-2020 empowers farmers to engage with processors, aggregators, wholesalers, large retailers and exporters through advanced agreements on pre-agreed prices.Tomar said the state’s APMC Act will stay and the states continue to collect taxes within their mandis. He said the Centre had neither intention nor tried to force any law on any state. He was reacting to Amarinder Singh’s remarks that the law was forced on Punjab.Defends Harsimrat’s statementWhen questioned over Akali Dal’s statement on these reforms, especially by Bathinda MP and Union minister Harsimrat Kaur Badal, Tomar said, “The Akali Dal represents farmers and the party has all right to express all sort of feelings of the peasantry,”.The ordinances, he said, were brought after through discussions in the cabinet.“Moreover, Harisimrat has not said anything against ordinances at all. She had only reacted to questions over apprehensions on stopping the MSP system and rightly said that MSP should not be stopped. She has only cleared Centre’s position as MSP will continue,” said Tomar||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/agri-ordinances-not-violative-of-federal-structure-centre/story-IMHyiqFGGfE3VB7XaB8IuK.html

It had shut services after the lockdown was announced, although a few buses were plying for ferrying staffers in essential services. From Monday, it resumes operation with restrictions in view of the Covid-19 outbreakThe normal sitting capacity of a BEST bus is 54 passengers. The 30 passengers allowed to board a BEST bus from Monday will include 25 sitting and five standing. One passenger each will be allowed to sit on the left and right sides of the bus. The second seat will be kept vacant. BEST has a fleet of 3,500 buses.Initially, the administration has stated that nearly 2,000 buses will be introduced and later approximately 300 buses will be added every week after checking the increase in number of passengers. “30 people will be allowed to commute in one bus. A proportionate number of people will be allowed to commute in double deckers and mini buses. The buses will be operational throughout the city,” said Manoj Varade, BEST spokesperson.Transport experts have, however, pointed out that there is a possibility of social-distancing norms not being adhered to in the buses and have asked the administration to bring in school buses. During morning and evening peak hours, BEST buses are often jam-packed. “There are chances of crowding in buses and social distancing norms not being adhered to. There are 6,000 school buses kept idle, which should be introduced along with BEST buses. The presence of buses on the road should be felt.” said transport expert Ashok Datar. Meanwhile, suburban trains will remain shut. There are no plans to start local trains in the city immediately. More than 80 lakh passengers travel by local trains every day. “There has been no discussion or plan on resuming local train services in the city as of now. It can be risky to commence local trains due to the easy spread of coronavirus,” said a railways official.The BEST had earlier commenced its bus services for transporting essential workers in the city. 1,800 buses were being operated daily for transport of essential workers in the city. Later, BEST air-conditioned (AC) minibuses were also converted into ambulances for transporting patients in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-s-second-bout-of-heavy-pre-monsoon-showers-uproots-trees-floods-roads-again/story-ehAk47c7TsjDo61lcIcKjJ.html

The buses will be operational throughout the city,” said Manoj Varade, BEST spokesperson.Transport experts have, however, pointed out that there is a possibility of social-distancing norms not being adhered to in the buses and have asked the administration to bring in school buses. During morning and evening peak hours, BEST buses are often jam-packed. “There are chances of crowding in buses and social distancing norms not being adhered to. There are 6,000 school buses kept idle, which should be introduced along with BEST buses. The presence of buses on the road should be felt.” said transport expert Ashok Datar. Meanwhile, suburban trains will remain shut. There are no plans to start local trains in the city immediately. More than 80 lakh passengers travel by local trains every day. “There has been no discussion or plan on resuming local train services in the city as of now. It can be risky to commence local trains due to the easy spread of coronavirus,” said a railways official.The BEST had earlier commenced its bus services for transporting essential workers in the city. 1,800 buses were being operated daily for transport of essential workers in the city. Later, BEST air-conditioned (AC) minibuses were also converted into ambulances for transporting patients in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-30-passengers-in-best-s-social-distance-mode/story-k6jUYcMpuXaZrCjm9KjLdJ.html
07-06-2020||Mumbai||BEST to resume bus ops from Monday; Covid tally is 82,968||The state on Saturday reported 2,739 new Covid-19 cases and 120 more deaths, taking the tally and toll to 82,968 and 2,969 respectively, as the government moved towards easing curbs in a graded manner, which includes BEST resuming bus operations, albeit with restrictions, in the city from Monday — around three months after it was shut owing to the pandemic. The state expects the coronavirus curve to start flattening within the next 10 days.Meanwhile, state health minister Rajesh Tope announced that the government will procure 10,000 vials of Remdesivir injections for critical patients. Mumbai, the worst-affected Indian city, saw 1,274 more cases, taking its count to 47,354, while the toll rose to 1,577 with 58 more deaths. The state’s recovery rate improved to 45.06% as 37,390 infected people have been discharged so far. A total of 2,234 patients recovered in the past 24 hours. The fatality rate slightly increased to 3.57% as the past five days have seen an average of more than 100 deaths reported per day. The state health department has, however, clarified that only 30 deaths happened in the past two days, while the remaining 90 casualties are from the May 3 to June 3. The state government has started rolling out its Mission Begin Again from Wednesday by extending more relaxations in a phase-wise manner. After allowing travelling within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) and opening of shops on odd-even basis early this week, private offices will start operating at 10% of their total staff strength from Monday. The state government expects an initial surge in cases in the wake of these relaxations, but it is also hopeful about a downward trend in the next ten days. Dr Sanjay Oak, who heads a task-force of 11 doctors constituted by the government for the clinical management of critically ill patients, said a flattening of the curve is expected by June 17. “I look at Wuhan where the flattening of the curve was witnessed on the 72nd or 76th day of the lockdown, and by that parameter, we expect it in the next ten days. We also expect herd immunity to develop among people in the next few days. There will be a rise in cases over the next ten days in Mumbai owing to the resumption of activities. There is no doubt that there would be a surge, but there is no need to worry as the infrastructure is ready to cope with the surge,” he said. State health officials say that Mumbai is expected to take ten days more than Wuhan due to the high density of population and hence they expect the downward trend by June 15. According to the officials from the state government, authorities have been directed to tighten curbs in containment zones and at the same time improve health infrastructure at the local level. “There will be a rise in Covid-19 cases over the next few days after the beginning of relaxations in the lockdown. Like the surge witnessed in districts such as Osamanabad, Beed, Parbhani, there will be a rise in cases in the red zones over the next week. The authorities have been asked to brace for complete tracing in 24 hours after a patient is reported. Most of the cases reported in the rural parts and semi-urban areas are patients who are travelling from big cities such as Mumbai and Pune. The authorities have been directed to monitor the influx minutely to contain the spread from these travellers,” an official, who did not want to be quoted, said.Dr Oak said that the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has been requested to begin medical camps in densely populated areas from Sunday to trace vulnerable people at the early stage. He said this would help them in keeping the number of Covid-19 cases in check.Tope announced on Saturday that the state government will procure 10,000 vials of Remdesivir injection. “The injection proved effective against SARS infection and is expected to be beneficial for coronavirus too as suggested by the World Health Organisation (WHO). We have decided to purchase 10,000 vials of the injection from the Corporate Social Responsibility fund of corporate houses,” he said. “GoM to procure 10k vials of Remdesivir. Based on evidence from Laboratory, animal and clinical studies, It has generated promising results in MERS-CoV and SARS, which are also caused by coronavirus,” Tope tweeted. The injection, which is expensive, is being used by some Covid-19 patients who can afford it. Tope said that the state government will finalise standard operation procedure for the use of injections for general patients. Of the 120 deaths reported on Saturday, 90 were from the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), including 58 in Mumbai, 10 in Thane and six each in Ulhasnagar and Navi Mumbai. Ten were in Pune and five each in Satara, Nashik and Mira-Bhayander. 53 of the people who died were above 60 years of age and 69 of them had comorbidities . The state now has 85 testing laboratories functional, including 38 private labs. 14,178 samples were tested in the last 24 hours, with a positivity rate of 19.31%. State has 3,603 containment zones, which have greater curbs of lockdown in place, while 18,422 surveillance teams ensure tracing of contacts. Currently, 5,46,566 people are under home quarantine.Meanwhile, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar warned private hospitals with strict action against negligence in treating infected patients. He has directed authorities to take strict action against the hospital administration for unethical practices and appoint senior officials for the coordination.Tope also hinted that the fall in coronavirus tests is expected after the committee of the state medical officers appointed for the fixation of the rate submits its report. He said that since the kits required for the tests are now available in the domestic market, the charges of the test need to be looked into again. The state health department issued a notification on Saturday, allowing home quarantine for Covid-19 patients with no or very mild symptoms. The norm ,which was applicable in Mumbai, has now been allowed across the state. Patients with adequate facilities for home isolation will be allowed to home quarantine for 17 days from the sample taken for the test. Dedicated caretaker for such a patient has been made mandatory. The notification has also issued guidelines for such home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/best-to-resume-bus-ops-from-monday-covid-tally-is-82-968/story-OFGQeXVdzSwba49i9d8j5O.html

One structure – a government building made of concrete – survived high speed winds, while the other that did not sustain any damage was a house which had four layers of tin, making it difficult for the combined sheets to fly off. “The rest of the village is brutally damaged,” said Rangnath Vare, a resident of the village who teaches in a Lonavala college. “While there were high speed winds through the day, the main impact was felt around 3pm on Wednesday, when most of the structures lost their rooftop and even utensils or metal doors went flying.”The local tehsildar had come to inspect the damages at the site on Friday. “We had been told that help will be provided by Monday. Another village, less than 300 metres from ours, did not witness this much damage. It seems that the system would have passed over this particular region before weakening,” added Vare.

07-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga: Three days on, rescuers finally reach landfall site Shrivardhan||Three days after Cyclone Nisarga made landfall, teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) and local administration on Saturday finally reached Shrivardhan taluka in Raigad district, which was the most affected along the Maharashtra coast.On Wednesday, around 12.15pm, Nisarga made landfall at Diveagar located, 21 km north of Shrivardhan and left a trail of destruction within a 100-kilometre (km) radius north and south of the landfall site. Raigad’s district collector Nidhi Choudhari said rescue teams from other parts of the district had been directed to Shrivardhan. “The scale of damage in this taluka is very high. We have still not received reports from all affected villages yet. We are sending teams from rest of the district to Shrivardhan. Three NDRF teams from Murud and Alibag are on their way as well. A 60-member damage assessment team from Uran, Karjat, and Panvel tehsils have additionally been deployed for Shrivardhan,” said Choudhari.A few Shrivardhan residents managed to inform the district headquarters in Alibag on Saturday morning of the scale of damages. “On Friday late evening, NDRF teams cleared trees and electric poles from the Mhasala Bypass road that connects Shrivardhan taluka to other northern talukas in the district. That is how we reached Alibag on Saturday,” said Siddhesh Raut, resident of Arati village in Shrivardhan. “Large beach-facing hotels have lost their rooftops and windows were blown away. It will take us months to recuperate.”“Relief and rehabilitation work are underway after all roads leading to Shrivardhan were cleared of fallen trees,” said Mahesh Kumar, inspector, NDRF.Kedar Wani, resident of Shrivardhan city said electric poles, trees and structures across Shrivardhan city, Harihareshwar, Bagmandla, Kolmandale, Puradure, Dighi, Kondvil, Diveagar, Nanavali, Shekhadi, Arati, Borli, and Bharadkhol suffered maximum damage. “We have been without electricity and no communication for 72 hours since the cyclone. Almost 97% of major structures that had tin roofs have either been damaged or do not have a roof at all. Only those with strong foundation and concrete rooftops have survived. However, some of those have also had trees falling on them,” said Wani.So far, two deaths have been reported in Raigad district and two in Pune. Of these, one was of a 15-year-old boy who fell under a collapsed wall in Nigdi village. “There may be more cases in remote villages, but since there is no connectivity, critical information is not being transmitted to local authorities,” said Wani.Sarfaraz Darzi, a resident of Borli village, said, “Owing to maximum houses having no rooftops and sporadic showers at least three to four times a day, furniture and all other household items are being destroyed. Some houses were flooded post the cyclone. On top of this there is no electricity.”Preliminary assessment of damages from the cyclone across eight of 15 tehsils in the district showed over 5 lakh structures were partially damaged, 1.10 lakh tree fall incidents, over 2,200 power lines affected and close to 500 network towers destroyed.

Hooda said since the government had assured to continue the purchase till June 30, the commitment should be honoured. The leader of the opposition in a statement said farmers should get more time to sell their crops in line with the schedule announced by the government. “I urge the government to show a sense of urgency in lifting crops from market yards and make payments to the farmers instead of closing the purchase process three weeks ahead of the schedule. About 17 lakh MT of wheat is yet to be lifted from the markets,” Hooda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/continue-wheat-procurement-till-june-30-hooda-urges-haryana-govt/story-5w0RfOgTlI1apiL3bdGMWL.html

They accused the officials of adopting ‘pick and choose formula’ and giving preference to the farmers known to them while buying the produce. As per the schedule, 100 farmers are allowed to sell their crop daily, but the protesters alleged that the officials did not prepare any chart to choose the farmers. They (officials) had been randomly calling the farmers known to them, claimed Rakesh Bains, a farmers’ leader.

07-06-2020||Chandigarh||Properties of 100 convicted gangsters to be attached in Kapurthala||Local police have identified 100 convicted gangsters, who will have their property and assets attached over the next few weeks. A list has been compiled of properties where drug money has been invested and the value of these assets is around Rs 33 crore. The majority of these properties include chunks of agricultural land and residential buildings, along with expensive vehicles and cash in bank accounts. Work on attaching such ill-gotten assets is an ongoing process, but this year, police have adopted a more focused and targeted approach. To date this year, property worth Rs 18 crore has already been seized against the corresponding figure for 2019, which was only Rs 2 crore. In May, police attached asserts of 26 drug smugglers valued at Rs 14.2 crore on the orders of the competent authority under the Smugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators (Forfeiture of Property) Act, and Section 68F (2) of Narcotics Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act. Earlier this year, district police seized assets of around Rs 2 crore of five drug peddlers. This included a double-storey house and a vehicle worth Rs 55 lakh of Malkeet Singh in Latiyawal village and a house and a car of Harpreet Singh in Toti village valued at Rs 43 lakh. “We have sent a list of eight more drug peddlers for the seizure of assets of around Rs 2.8 crore to the competent authority in Delhi this month. Thirty more gangsters are on our radar. Seizure of properties will break the backbone of illegal drug trade and will act as a deterrent,” SSP Satinder Singh said. He added for specific, immediate seizure, properties of two more drug peddlers had been identified. “These Delhi-based smugglers are under arrest, and were active in this region for the higher profit margin.” Tackling the issue of drug peddling from another front, the district police had also adopted 16 villages in 2019. On the list were the two villages of Latiyawal and Toti, notorious for this trade; 30 FIRs were registered under the NDPS Act in these villages in 2019. Under the police plan, the DSP supervises a ‘Nasha Mukti Dal’ (Freedom from Drugs group) in each of the adopted villages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/properties-of-100-convicted-gangsters-to-be-attached-in-kapurthala/story-7fLviWyFj5U1PhedEwZQhP.html
07-06-2020||Mumbai||Operation Dolphin Nose: NIA arrests 53-year-old bizman for leaking vital Navy information||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday arrested a 53-year-old Abdul Rehman Abdul Jabbar Sheikh, a Mumbai resident, who is believed to be a conspirator in the Visakhapatnam espionage case. Sheikh’s wife Shaista Qaiser, who was born in Pakistan, was earlier arrested in connection with the same case for terror funding as part of the operation code-named ‘Dolphin Nose’.Sheikh, a resident of Agripada in south Mumbai, is a businessman and runs a firm named ‘SR Enterprises’ which exports groundnut to Afghanistan. Sheikh used his wife’s phone to share crucial information regarding positioning of Indian Navy ships and submarines at its critical bases. NIA conducted a search at Sheikh’s residence on Saturday and seized digital devices and incriminating documents from his house, said an NIA official. Earlier, apart Qaiser, NIA had arrested key conspirator Mohammed Haroon Haji Abdul Rehman Lakdawala from south Mumbai on May 15. During searches at Lakdawala’s house, several digital devices and incriminating documents had also been seized by NIA.Sheikh is the fifteenth arrest made in operation ‘Dolphin Nose’ wherein the espionage racket was busted by the Special Intelligence Branch of the Andhra Pradesh Police along with Naval Intelligence and the Intelligence Bureau. The case was later transferred to NIA.“Lakdawala had travelled to Karachi under the guise of conducting cross-border trade and used to meet Pakistani spies, possible code-named Akbar alias Ali and Rizwan,” said an NIA official. The first arrests were made on December 20 when the agencies arrested seven Indian Navy personnel from Visakhapatnam, Mumbai and Karwar bases along with one hawala operator. Later in February, three more navy personnel were arrested in the case along with Pakistan-born Indian national Shaista Qaiser.Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agents had honey-trapped the Indian sailors through Facebook, WhatsApp and online dating sites, and were allegedly paid through Indian conduits for getting crucial information regarding positioning of Indian Navy ships and submarines at its critical bases, said sources in the intelligence agencies. After the sailors fell for the ‘women’ on the dating sites, which were profiles created by ISI, the ‘women’ would introduce them to a businessman, a Pakistani handler, who elicited information the sailors, said NIA officials. If the sailor refused to reveal certain information, the ‘women’ would then blackmail them by threatening to reveal their online chats which were sexual in nature, and extract information about positions and movements of our vessels, added NIA officials.The espionage racket started in 2018, and the sailors were paid through a hawala operator who has been arrested. Lakdawala was directly involved in depositing money into the bank accounts of the Navy personnel at regular intervals through different methods,” said an official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/operation-dolphin-nose-nia-arrests-53-year-old-bizman-for-leaking-vital-navy-information/story-ACMiIajqp0U6vBG8gPL59N.html

On May 8, Khan returned with a carry bag and threw petrol from a bottle on the door of the lodge before setting it on fire.Khan went into hiding after the incident but was tracked down and arrested on June 3. “While he was being taken for remand, he complained of chest pains. He was taken to JJ Hospital where he is under observation and undergoing treatment,” said a police officer.Avinash Dharmadhikari, assistant commissioner of police, Dongri division, confirmed the arrest and said that Aziz had at least five cases of dacoity, murder, and extortion registered against him. He was released on bail in a bid to decongest Arthur Road jail during the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/32-year-old-out-on-bail-arrested-for-setting-ablaze-lodge-door/story-EtrR9OWWs8pX97QgrN8w4O.html
07-06-2020||Mumbai||Lockdown 4.0: Max dip in PM2.5 in Mumbai||The city’s air had the least amount of tiny and deadly pollutant particles during lockdown 4.0 as compared to Delhi, Ahmedabad, and Pune.The concentration of PM2.5 — breathable particulate matter of 2.5 micron size that can easily enter the lungs and cause health ailments — was the lowest among four cities being monitored by air quality researchers during lockdown 4.0 as compared to the same period in 2019. Mumbai also showed the highest percentage decline in PM2.5 among major cities of the country.Lockdown 4.0 from May 17 to May 31 was the fourth phase of nationwide clampdown to curb the spread of Covid-19 pandemic. The System of Air Quality Weather Forecasting and Research (SAFAR), which has been publishing regular reports of each lockdown period, released the latest one on Saturday.According to the analysis, Mumbai recorded a 56% reduction in PM2.5 during the 15-day period as compared to the corresponding time last year. The reduction in Ahmedabad was 30%, Delhi 13%, and Pune 7%. Similarly the concentration for PM2.5 was 20 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) in Mumbai during lockdown 4.0 as opposed to 48μg/m3 last year. It was 35μg/m3 and 31μg/m3 in Pune in 2020 and 2019 respectively. The concentration was the highest in Delhi with 53μg/m3 during lockdown 4.0 followed by Ahmedabad at 45μg/m3. In 2019, both cities recorded 65μg/m3 and 64μg/m3.“Mumbai had much more cleaner air during lockdown 4.0 due to a combination of factors. Air quality improved as an effect of natural weather factors such as windy conditions and sporadic rain but most importantly the lockdown compliance was strictly followed as relaxations in Mumbai were minimal as compared to other cities,” said Gufran Beig, director, SAFAR.Meanwhile, a similar trend was witnessed for PM10 (larger coarser particles) pollutants. Mumbai witnessed maximum reduction at 54% followed by Pune (32%), Ahmedabad (31%), and Delhi (16%). However, nitrogen dioxide (NO2) level — which results from vehicular emissions and fossil fuel burning — decline was the highest in Delhi and Pune at 49% each followed by Mumbai at 48% and Ahmedabad 22%. “This is because movement of vehicles began across all major cities in the fourth phase of lockdown,” said Beig adding, “Mumbai can expect clean air through the week but air quality may witness a spike if rainfall is not there.”Meanwhile, a study by air quality research group UrbanEmissions.info found that over all four periods of lockdown, most Maharashtra cities, including Mumbai, had achieved 20%-30% reduction in PM2.5 levels as hoped to be achieved by the Centre’s National Clean Air Action Plan (NCAP). Maharashtra has 18 non-attainment cities, highest in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lockdown-4-0-max-dip-in-pm2-5-in-mumbai/story-cKpickzF5WoKhtIhpfVBhP.html
07-06-2020||Chandigarh||FIR against former DGP Saini: CBI says no record available of probe into Multani’s disappearance||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Saturday told a Chandigarh court that it does not have any record of the preliminary investigation in the alleged abduction and fake encounter case of Balwant Singh Multani in 1991, involving former Punjab Director General of Police (DGP), Sumedh Singh Saini. The CBI’s response came on an application moved by the Punjab Police seeking documents of the preliminary probe, when the CBI was investigating the disappearance of Multani in 2007. It had also sought that the court summons record of the same.Last month, a case was registered against Saini and seven others under Sections 364 (kidnapping or abduction in order to murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 344 (wrongful confinement), 330 (voluntarily causing hurt to exhort confession) and 120 (B) (criminal conspiracy) in Mohali, on a complaint from Multani’s brother, Palwinder Singh Multani. SAINI IS ON BAIL GRANTED BY A MOHALI COURT.On Saturday, the CBI submitted before special magistrate Ravish Kaushik that the documents collected during the investigation were either returned to the departments concerned or weeded out as per norms. Balwant Singh Multani, son of an IAS officer who worked as a junior engineer with Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO), was allegedly picked up by two police officers after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then Chandigarh SSP. In the attack, four policemen in his security were killed. The police later claimed that Multani had escaped from the custody of the Qadian police in Punjab and his whereabouts, since then, were not known.In 2007, the CBI had started investigating the case under the directions of Punjab and Haryana high court. In 2011, however, the Supreme Court quashed the probe after an appeal from the state government. The matter will be taken up for further arguments on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fir-against-former-dgp-saini-cbi-says-no-record-available-of-probe-into-multani-s-disappearance/story-AGGeinZ3rYeTyMb5yZhQVI.html

This comes a day after Amarinder formed a special investigation team (SIT) to probe the alleged illicit liquor scam in the state. The panel, comprising housing and urban development minister Sukhbinder Singh Sarkaria, public works minister (PWD) minister Vijay Inder Singla, financial resources adviser VK Garg, secretary (school education) Krishan Kumar and retired IAS officer DS Kalha, has been asked to submit its recommendations in 60 days on breaking such network and as how to increase the excise revenue, a government spokesperson said.While working in coordination with the SIT, which has been tasked with investigating all aspects of illicit liquor trade, including complicity of excise officials, the committee will identify the gaps causing revenue losses to the state exchequer.The CM mandated the panel to offer suggestions on long-term legal and administrative reforms after consultations with the stakeholders.Amarinder pointed out that despite various policy changes by the excise and taxation Department, inadequate increase in revenue besides illicit liquor trade remain a matter of concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-cm-forms-excise-reforms-panel-to-break-liquor-nexus/story-Cuwj3hEfRHFNvmtluUROsJ.html

07-06-2020||Chandigarh||Living with Corona: Surgeries in three-layer PPEs new normal at Chandigarh’s PGIMER||For doctors at the neurosurgery department of the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), it was going to be a routine surgery performed in emergency situations. But only a few minutes before the surgery, the patient with a head injury tested positive for the coronavirus.It was the first of its kind surgery that the doctors at the institute had to perform on a Covid positive patient that continued for around three hours on May 29. Another such surgery followed that was conducted earlier this week. So far, around four surgeries on suspected or positive patients have been conducted at PGIMER.“We had been preparing for this. We knew this was going to happen soon, but we expected them to be cases of pregnant women about to deliver, but this was unexpected. We had conducted mock drills in which we noted actual time to shift the patient from the wards concerned to the designated Covid-19 operation theatre,” said professor Vipin Koushal, in-charge of Covid hospital at PGIMER.The main concerns remain, “How to shift the equipment from the respective departments’ operation theatres to the Covid facility and more importantly, training surgeons to don and doff personal protection equipment,” he added.REAL CHALLENGE BEGINS IN OT“It is a totally different setup now. Covid-19 has changed the way surgeries are performed. Surgeons have to don PPE including face shields and perform complicated procedures wearing those heavy suits,” said Dr SK Gupta, head of neurosurgery department, PGIMER, during a media interaction.The emergency and trauma services of the institute have been fully functional throughout the lockdown period. In surgical specialties, around 40-50 such patients are being managed every day. In neurosurgery alone, 545 emergency and trauma cases have been operated upon. These were patients with head injury, spine injury, brain hemorrhage, brain stroke and brain tumours. However, doctors say it is tough to conduct these procedures wearing PPE suits, without air-conditioners.Dr Anurodh Kumar, one of the surgeons, said: “When there is an open skull in front of you, you don’t think about what you are wearing. But when you sit down for a break, you notice the sweat and fog on your face shields. It is tough but there is no choice here. You have to continue anyhow. It has to get normalised and we are getting training for it.”‘TESTING MUST BE RAMPED UP’Commenting upon how this can be managed in the future, Dr Gupta said there is no short-cut to it, but testing has to be ramped up. “For emergency patients, we cannot wait for a long duration for the patient’s Covid status, but PGIMER has started using a tuberculosis machine, GeneXpert, for quicker diagnosis,” he said.The GeneXpert was launched at PGIMER in 2016 to speedily diagnose multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing system generates results in two hours, which can otherwise take somewhere between 6-7 hours.“If you know the Covid status of the patient, you plan the surgery accordingly but with precautions always. Virus is going to stay for a long time, and this process has to become the new normal now,” Dr Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/living-with-corona-surgeries-in-three-layer-ppes-new-normal-at-chandigarh-s-pgimer/story-HhlHPuvjpwH4U1Ycxizg3O.html

In a statement, SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal said, “Karah parsad and langar are an integral part of the maryada of gurdwaras. Prohibiting both the services is not fair. The needy, who lost their livelihoods during the lockdown, are being provided free food from the community kitchens. We are following all the guidelines of the health department while preparing the langar and serving it.”“The decision onreopening the gurdwaras is welcome but ban on langar and parsad must be reviewed. Religious sentiments of the devotees are linked with it and the government should give respect the same,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/norms-on-reopening-shrines-sgpc-objects-to-ban-on-serving-parsad-langar-in-gurdwaras/story-OY2RVJfvm7CbuhIcUotQhN.html
07-06-2020||Education||CBSE, ICSE boards share Class 10, 12 data with Maharashtra to plan board exams||Two days after the Maharashtra government requested the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) and Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) to postpone Class 10 and 12 exams or mark students on their internal assessments, the state held a virtual meeting with board officials on Saturday morning to further discuss the issue.Officials from both boards submitted data on students from the state who will appear for their board exams this year. As per the data, nearly 12,000 students in the state are enrolled for their Class 12 CBSE examinations which are set to take place between July 1 and 15.There are no pending Class 10 CBSE papers in the state. Nearly 23,000 students from the state have registered for the ICSE (Class 10) and ISC (Class 12) exams which were scheduled to be held between July 1 and 14, as per the revised schedule.The state government will now look at the data and come up with a possible solution to the issue. “It will take some time to arrive at a decision because the situation in each part of the state will have to be considered separately. Based on the data, the education department will see what is best for students,” said an official privy to the meeting. Other officials who were a part of the meeting refused to comment on the issue.On June 4, the state government had written to the heads of both boards requesting them not to conduct exams in July. It had said that in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis in the state, students would find it difficult to travel to their centres and conducting examinations would mean risking the health of several students. The letter thus stated that the government would not permit the boards to conduct the exams as there is too much risk involved.CBSE and ICSE officials said that complete cancellation of exams might not be possible. “We have already allowed students to participate in compartmental exams which will be conducted after the main exams, in case of unforeseen circumstances. Students who cannot reach centres for some reason or reside in areas that are containment zones can apply through their schools and avail a concession,” said an official from the ICSE board.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cbse-icse-share-class-10-12-data-with-state-to-plan-exams/story-Y3v1MdWhLDM98bon0gDL7N.html
07-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s coronavirus count up to 47K, case doubling rate reaches 22 days||As the number of cases in the city inches towards the 50,000-mark, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) claims to have traced over 8.94 lakh high-risk and low-risk contacts of over 45,854 positive cases. Meanwhile, the doubling rate in the city rose to 22 days on Saturday, according to the data from the civic body. Of the 8.94 lakh contacts traced, around 2.19 lakh were high-risk and 6.74 lakh were low-risk. High-risk contacts are those who are directly in touch with the Covid-positive patient, for example, a family member or friend. Low-risk contacts are those residing around, but not in direct contact with the infected person. Daksha Shah, deputy executive health officer of BMC, said, “It is because of proactive contact tracing that we have been able to contain the virus spread. We have also collected 500 blood samples for a sero-surveillance test under which antibodies are detected. The results for the same are awaited.” BMC officials have credited the aggressive contact tracing for keeping the case numbers lower than its projections. The civic body claims that it had predicted over 45,000 cases by the end of May but the 45,000 figure was crossed only on June 5.Further, the overall growth rate of the infection in the city is now 3.28%, for which BMC has conducted over 2.20 lakh tests. The latest doubling rate of the city is 22 days, up from 10 days in the first week of May. However, since the first week of May, the case count has almost doubled. The doubling rate determines the time taken for the number of positive patients to double in a specific area.On Saturday, the city reported a total of 1,274 cases and 58 new deaths, taking the total case count to 47,354 and the death toll to 1,577, according to state health department data.The total number of active cases in the city as of Saturday stands at 25,794.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-s-coronavirus-count-up-to-47k-case-doubling-rate-reaches-22-days/story-odaz2c5p1cntdRIANQvztN.html

Talks are on for the past few months to fix a meeting between Union home minister Amit Shah and Longowal to negotiate a settlement to the 35-year-old case.The communication, initiated on the Delhi High Court’s orders following a hearing on December 4, 2019, came to a halt due to the pandemic outbreak. “We will discuss the matter with our legal experts and Sikh scholars and act accordingly,” said Longowal replying to a media query during an interaction at the Akal Takht secretariat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/operation-bluestar-will-decide-after-due-deliberations-says-sgpc-on-centre-s-offer-on-damages/story-EhxrDQ6tMXN50D6LtvIl9H.html
07-06-2020||Mumbai||Fadnavis: Maharashtra government suffers from ‘action paralysis’||Claiming that the number of tests for Covid-19 in Mumbai has reduced drastically despite there being a rise in cases, Leader of Opposition and former chief minister (CM) Devendra Fadnavis said the Maharashtra government is suffering from “action paralysis”. “The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is not only suffering from policy paralysis but also action paralysis. There is no coordination among the three ruling parties, coordination is also lacking between the government and the administration. This has affected their decision making,” said Fadnavis while addressing an online press conference on Saturday.Fadnavis also alleged that testing for Covid-19 in Mumbai has dropped drastically over the past few days when the number of patients increased to a large extent. He said that testing in Mumbai compared to state figures has dropped to 27% as on May 31, from 56% on May 1. “This is a serious lapse and the government should immediately increase the number of tests being conducted in the city,” he said. The BJP leader criticised the government for failing to implement its own announcements. “They announced plans to reserve 80% of the beds in private hospitals for the poor, but in reality, the acquisition has not happened from the [hospitals associated with] ‘influential’ people. The treatment announced under Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, the medical insurance scheme extended to the entire population, is not applicable in many Mumbai hospitals,” he said.The former CM also blamed the government for the lack of personal protection equipment (PPE) kits for frontline workers. “The initial stock of the kits was procured from corporate houses under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) drive. To shrug off responsibility, the state has blamed the Centre for inadequate supply of PPE kits,” he said.Lashing out at the Shiv Sena, Fadnavis said that the party was inconsistent in its political stand. “Sometimes they praise the Prime Minister, while the next moment they criticise him. Similarly, they attack the Maharashtra governor over some issue and bow before him the next moment,” he said. He also demanded that an adequate relief package be announced for citizens affected by Cyclone Nisarga this week. “The government should look beyond the standing NDRF (National Disaster Response Force) norms for the relief package for the natural calamity. We had given relief three times more than the norms to the Sangli-Kolhapur flood-affected people last year. A similar policy should be allotted by the government for the cyclone-affected people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fadnavis-maharashtra-government-suffers-from-action-paralysis/story-e08D7Ll3vpl0SjvilOgpvL.html

07-06-2020||Mumbai||Dearth of beds for Covid-19 patients as Mumbai prepares for surge in cases||While the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) says it is prepared to tackle the expected rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in the city, data shows that despite BMC increasing the number of beds for critically-ill patients, only 3% of beds in intensive care units (ICUs) and with ventilators are vacant.In the past two weeks, BMC has increased the bed strength in hospitals. Till May 25, BMC had 644 ICU beds, which has increased to 1,102. The number of ventilators has increased from 359 to 459 in the same time period. However, available data shows that only nine beds in ICU are available for critically-ill patients in ICU and only 32 of the beds with ventilators are available for patients with severely low oxygen saturation.In Mumbai, 4,650 beds with oxygen facility are available but only 26% are empty. Also, while BMC has increased the bed strength for suspected Covid-19 patients to 1,205 in 128 hospitals across the city, 77% of the beds are occupied.BMC has maintained it is prepared to handle the spike in reported cases that is expected with the lockdown being relaxed. “The cases might increase with the relaxation but we are ready to handle it. We have increased the bed strength and will add more into it. Overall, we have over 25,000 beds including the Covid care centres (CCC),” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner.BMC has also increased the strength of CCC-2, where asymptomatic patients along with mildly symptomatic patients may be admitted. These are in makeshift grounds, lodges, schools, colleges among other structures. The total capacity in CCC-2 has been increased to 7,105 and 61% of the beds are occupied.On June 2, Ravi Ram Ahuja, a 53-year-old resident of Shivajinagar, was rushed to a local nursing home in the afternoon, which refused to admit him as he didn’t have a certificate declaring he was Covid-negative. Suffering from fever, cold and diarrhoea — all symptoms of Covid-19 — he was referred to Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, also known as Sion Hospital. After being made for two hours, Ahuja’s family was informed that the patient needed to be admitted to ICU. However, as no beds were available, the hospital couldn’t admit the patient.“We called the helpline number of BMC (1916), but they gave us a waiting list of 26. But my father was already suffocating. We called nearby private hospitals, but no ICU beds were available,” said Sanjay Ahuja, his son. After waiting another hour, they took Ahuja to BYL Nair Hospital. At around 4pm, Nair Hospital admitted Ahuja and immediately shifted him to a ventilator.“Next day, early morning, he was declared dead. His Covid [test] report came on June 4, a day after his death. He was Covid-positive,” said Ahuja, adding that BMC has refused to test his mother, who is diabetic, as she isn’t showing any symptoms.HT has reported several stories of patients who have struggled to avail treatment for Covid-19.Medical experts and officials expressed concern about BMC’s preparation and the healthcare infrastructure since the number of reported cases of Covid-19 in Mumbai continues to be more than 1,000 daily.“In the two months of lockdown, we failed to increase the strength of the beds, ambulances and oxygen. The main motive of a national lockdown is to strengthen the infrastructure to fight against Covid-19. The whole nation is lagging behind,” said a senior health officer from the state government.As HT reported on Saturday, the doubling rate of the infection has improved in several wards, but there are questions raised about whether enough tests are being conducted. BMC is currently at 65% of its official daily testing capacity of over 7,000 samples a day.Borivli resident Surendra Shah, lost his father to Covid-19 on May 31. For the past five days, he has been trying to get his mother, who is diabetic, tested for Covid-19.“Private labs won’t test without prescription and as my mother is asymptomatic, physicians aren’t prescribing swab tests. My mother is a high-risk contact, but there is no option to get tested. If anything happens to her, who will be responsible?” said Shah.Leader of the Opposition in BMC, Ravi Raja said, “Under the Epidemic Diseases Act, all private hospitals come under the purview of the corporation. Despite this, BMC took two months to procure 80% of the beds from private hospitals. Now, they are still considering requesting private ambulances. Why so many delays when people are dying?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/dearth-of-beds-for-covid-19-patients-as-mumbai-prepares-for-surge-in-cases/story-cRrVMVpwDQwmYU7wNvtGaO.html

The woman was in a relation with a man of her locality for the last few years but her family members, especially her younger brother, were opposed to the affair, police said. A case was registered against her younger brother under Sections 343 (wrongful confinement for three days or more) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at the Cantonment police station.The police swung into action after they were informed about the confinement by members of Anti-Crime and Animal Protection Association alleging violation of her human rights.“I wanted to marry my lover three years ago, but my brother did not let it happen making one excuse or the other. When I decided to marry him this time, my brother chained me. He also threatened to kill my lover,” she told the police after being rescued. Station house officer (SHO) Ranjit Singh said the role of her parents in the confinement episode was also being probed. “If they are found guilty, action will also be taken against them as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/woman-chained-to-bed-by-brother-to-prevent-from-solemnising-love-marriage-rescued/story-cj8zpJPtoepkpTLMHBF5VI.html
07-06-2020||Chandigarh||Trial of clothing not allowed in malls, no ‘prasad’, ‘langar’ at religious places||The Punjab government on Saturday announced to open malls, restaurants and places of worship from Monday with guidelines that the visitors to malls must have COVA app on their mobile phones and there will be no trial of clothing.

07-06-2020||Delhi||Malls, restaurants draw up plans to restart businesses but with restrictions||Anticipating that the Delhi government will allow them to reopen businesses after June 8, restaurants and mall owners in the national capital are busy with preparations to open shop after a gap of over 70 days. Restaurant owners said they are working on a set of plans such as opening with just 30% to 50% seating capacity, putting a cap on parking facility to ensure less crowding, and presenting patrons with e-copies of drinks and food menus to minimise contact with staff and ensure social distancing. Restaurants and shopping malls have been shut since the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageThe standard operating procedures (SOPs) prepared by the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) states that thermal screening of all guests will be compulsory at entry points and all patrons will have to wear masks. Provisions will also be made for special UV light filters, air filters and air purifiers on the premises. The air-conditioners will be kept at a constant temperature between 25 and 30 degrees Celsius. Manpreet Singh, treasurer NRAI, said, “We are ready to open restaurants as owners are suffering huge losses. We will follow social distancing and other preventive measures. Restaurants will operate at reduced seating capacity of 30% to 50%. All staff members will wear masks, face shields, gloves and hand sanitisers will be placed on all tables. Thermal screening will be mandatory for visitors.” Singh further said guests will have to sit on alternate tables, and all crockery and cutlery will be sanitised. Visitors will be given sanitised copies of the menu card. They will also have an option of checking the menu on their phones and place orders from their phones while seated inside the restaurant. He said the digital mode of payment will be encouraged.Sunil Malhotra, of Embassy Restaurant in Connaught Place, said, “It is not yet clear when the government will allow us to open. But when the nod comes, we will follow all guidelines issued by the central and state government.”Sandeep Khandelwal, president, Delhi Hotel and Restaurants Owners Association, said, “Nearly 50% of the workforce has returned to their home towns and so we will have to operate with fewer staff members. We want that the government to consult us before taking a call on the opening.” Over 40 mall owners on Saturday convened a meeting with the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) trade wing and appealed to the government to allow the opening of malls.Brijesh Goel, AAP’s Delhi trade wing convener, said there are nearly 100 malls and shopping centres in the city. “The government gets about ₹3 -10 crore revenue a month from each mall. Due to the closure of malls, the government is losing about ₹500 crore a month. A decision regarding the opening of malls is likely to be taken next week,” Goel said.Harshvardhan Bansal, owner of Unity Mall Group, said closure of malls has caused a job crisis for 10,000-odd employees.“We will have separate entry and exit points in every mall and all employees will be required to wear face shields and masks. Visitors will undergo thermal screening at every entry point and guards will also wear perosnal protective equipment kits, if required,” he said.A spokesperson at Select City Walk mall said they have prepared SOPs which include markings on the floor to help visitors and retail outlets maintain social distancing. “Parking will be restricted and will be kept to 50% of the total capacity, and we are looking at having contactless service. There will also be proper markings at counters and cash registers to prevent crowding, Plexiglas shields at all checkout points are also being looked into. Markings for social distancing will be made on escalators; whereas elevators will operate with a maximum of four people at a time,” the spokesperson said.“We will have isolation rooms and various retail outlets are formulating guidelines on the trials and return / exchange of products and will be as per the policies of individual brands,” the person said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/malls-restaurants-draw-up-plans-to-restart-businesses-but-with-restrictions/story-zNqGUQfsCUvOPVboyIEDbP.html
07-06-2020||Delhi||Plea in HC against Delhi govt order forbidding testing of asymptomatic patients||A plea has been filed in the Delhi High Court on Saturday challenging a June 2 order of the Delhi government about rules for the testing Covid-19 patients in the national Capital, stating that it violates the Constitution of India.The petition filed by advocate Abhay Gupta stated that the Delhi government in its June 2 order had allowed the testing of only symptomatic persons, and asymptomatic individuals are restricted from being tested. The plea is likely to be heard on June 9. Gupta said that the order also restricted the testing for direct and high-risk contacts only to those who are diabetic, have hypertension or cancer, and are senior citizens.“The change will only make it more difficult for asymptomatic people that have been exposed to infected people to be tested. That earlier, family members living in the same house or doctors and health care workers exposed to a Covid-19 patient were tested even if they were asymptomatic...,” the plea read.The petition also said that with the increasing number of cases, the government should administer more tests.Meanwhile, another plea was filed in the Delhi High Court by an ENT doctor, Manni Hingorani, seeking to test asymptomatic patients who are going in for surgery. Both matters are likely to be heard on June 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/plea-in-hc-against-delhi-govt-order-forbidding-testing-of-asymptomatic-patients/story-xmj6Bvod8r8u1g9JCFgTlM.html

07-06-2020||Delhi||RML screening centre to function only between 9am and 5pm from Sunday||The central government-run Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital has curbed the timings of their screening centre to limit the number of Covid-19 test samples collected. The screening centre, which used to be open throughout the day, will now function only between 9am and 5pm Sunday onwards, according to an order issued by the hospital.The hospital has seen a sharp increase in the number of patients coming in for Covid-19 testing over the last two days when the Delhi government barred seven laboratories in the city from testing samples. The government said they were not following proper Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines for testing.The hospital can test 300 to 350 samples a day. However, it was routinely stretching its capacity to test about 400 samples a day.“We have been working over capacity for some time now; we had to ask our staff to work overtime. But, over the past two days we have started receiving around 500 samples a day and it has become unmanageable. Hence, we have curtailed the timings,” Dr Minakshi Bharadwaj, medical superintendent of the hospital, said.The Aam Aadmi Party had earlier alleged that they found a 45% error on retesting 30 samples tested at RML hospital. The hospital said that the subsequent samples had been collected after 7 to 14 days, during which time the patients might have cleared the virus from their system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/rml-screening-centre-to-function-only-between-9am-and-5pm-from-sunday/story-zJGL1vZkMCCwxGv1FEsl0L.html

According to the state health bulletin, the tally of cumulative cases stands at 1,692, of which 1,345 are hospitalised or under home isolation and 343 have recovered from the illness. The death count stands at four.According to the district health department, of the 1,345 active cases, more than 750 people are under home isolation, 305 are in government and private hospitals, while 290 patients are in government-paid isolation facilities set up in hotels and guest houses across the city. Health officials said that nearly 80% of the patients infected with Covid-19 are asymptomatic and therefore can stay in home isolation. Data shows that of the 3,952 cases reported in Haryana, Gurugram’s share is almost 43%—the highest in the state. The test positivity rate is almost 47% while the doubling rate of the infection is almost four days, which means the infection is spreading at a rapid rate in the city. District administration officials said that they are strengthening the critical care facility. A designated team is collecting information from private hospitals regarding beds designated for Covid-19 patients and ventilators available in their facility. Besides ESIC Hospital in Sector 9 and Medeor in Manesar, the administration has reserved 100 beds in SGT Medical and some in World College of Medical Sciences, Jhajjar.Considering the surge in Covid-19 cases, the district administration has improvised the referral ambulance service. Sixteen telephone lines have been added to the 108 ambulance helpline number. The call centre for 108 is now functional at the Mini Secretariat. The Saral Kendra on the ground floor has been converted into a call centre, where 12 telephone operators are deployed. They will work 24x7 in three shifts. Ashok Sangwan, the divisional commissioner, visited the call centre on Saturday. Currently, the health department has 17 ambulances, of which only four are being used for Covid-19 patients and 13 are for non-Covid-19 ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-129-test-positive-city-about-to-touch-1-700-mark/story-MQ0SbmMHnzmxlJDUc3e1GJ.html
07-06-2020||Gurugram||Cops on lockdown duty to be tested thrice for accurate results, families of personnel in police lines to be screened||In view of the rising number of Covid-19 cases among police personnel, the health department has begun screening 450 personnel deployed across the city on lockdown duty. Officials said that personnel deployed on lockdown duty will be screened thrice in the next 14 days.Also, around 600 family members of police personnel living in police lines in Gurugram and Manesar will be screened within 10 days, after 10 policemen tested positive on Friday and Saturday.At present, 30 personnel — mostly deployed at borders and containment zones — have tested positive for Covid-19 in Gurugram. Officials said that the testing will be done thrice, as second tests of positive cases, done within four days of the first, gave a different result in at least 14 instances. According to the health department officials, conducting a screening every fifth day would help in identifying patients with symptoms. The incubation cycle of the coronavirus is at least five to seven days, therefore, it is crucial to screen suspected cases after every fifth day. Also, asymptomatic personnel in the first screening might turn out to be a Covid-19 patient in the second or third screening. The police said the most of the personnel who tested positive were asymptomatic, except for the police spokesperson, who worked out of the commissioner’s office building and three others. At least 10 of the 30 policemen are presently placed in home-isolation, while the rest are at a quarantine facility at police lines in Manesar.Dr Jaswant Singh Punia, chief medical officer (CMO), said that the infected police personnel have been put under isolation and contact tracing is being carried out.The police commissioner of Gurugram, Muhammad Akil, said that several measures are being taken to ensure that Covid-19 does not spread among the police personnel at different locations. “The health team is monitoring their health and if they spot any symptom, such as cough, cold and fever, will take their samples for testing and advise them to remain in isolation until their test results are declared,” he said.Officials said that steps are being taken to ensure supply of essentials and medical assistance to the family members of the 10 policemen who tested positive in police lines of Gurugram and Manesar.Akil said that an ambulance has also been retained on standby, to handle any emergency. “We have assigned an assistant commissioner of police, who is the nodal officer, to ensure the well-being of the families and ensure their demands are taken care of. Many had requested to allow tuition teachers due to the loss of studies before the online classes started. We have requested two teachers, who work in private schools, living on the campus to hold free online classes to help students facing difficulties,” he said.The police said that entry of outsiders in police lines has been suspended since the first week of April. Also, a quarantine ward was set up in April, said officials.Akil said they are maintaining a database of senior citizens, mostly parents of police personnel, and those with comorbid or underlying medical conditions for close monitoring and surveillance. A team of doctor and nurses have been deployed for the purpose, full time, for the past two months.Two mobile phone numbers of senior officials have also been shared with the families of police personnel, to cater to any exigency, said police. An assistant sub-inspector at the commissioner’s building has been directed to maintain a logbook of distress calls received from family members and mention the resolution. The ACP of the area shall inspect the logbooks weekly to ensure appropriate action has been taken, said officials.Regular sanitisation is conducted in police lines. Police personnel have been advised to spray sanitiser on themselves before entering their homes and to take a hot water bath before touching objects in the house.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-on-lockdown-duty-to-be-tested-thrice-for-accurate-results-families-of-personnel-in-police-lines-to-be-screened/story-7fbFVKjM4EzHox3BAOgThM.html

07-06-2020||Noida||19 persons ‘falsely’ tested positive in Gautam Budh Nagar, count reaches 591 with 21 new Covid-19 cases||In yet another alleged incident of ‘false’ positive reports given by private laboratories in Gautam Budh Nagar, as many as 19 people admitted to different Covid-19 facilities in the district two days ago were discharged on Saturday after they tested negative for the deadly infection in cross-verification tests by government labs.Meanwhile, 21 new positive cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) were reported on Saturday taking the overall tally of the district to 59. Apart from these cases, 52 other cases have been reported cross-notified to other districts and states. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said out of 591 positive cases reported till Saturday evening, 382 patients have been discharged from different hospitals, while eight patients lost their lives. “The district now has 201 active cases currently and 52 cases have been cross-notified from other districts and states,” he said.Dr Ohri further said 29 Covid-19 patients – including 21 patients from Super Speciality Paediatric Hospital in Sector 30 and eight from Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida​ – were discharged on Saturday. The list of discharged patients included the 19 persons who were admitted to Covid-19 facilities based on ‘false’ positive reports submitted by private labs.The CMO further said the district health department will issue show-cause notices to the private laboratories whose reports proved false on Saturday. “Such false reports create panic among the people during a pandemic. On Thursday, all private laboratories had been asked to strictly comply with the guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Giving such false reports is a blatant violation of the ICMR guidelines,” he said. Dr Ohri also said health camps were organised in 12 sensitive places, including Mamura, Nithari, Sarfabad, Harola, sectors 8, 9, and 10, on Saturday. “A total of 552 patients were screened today and 10 of them, who had symptoms of fever and ILI (influenza-like illnesses ), have been referred to the district hospital. Two people have been put under quarantine” he said.Giving details of 52 cross-notified Covid-19 positive cases, the CMO said while 15 patients are from Delhi, one patient each is from Haryana, West Bengal, and Andhra Pradesh. “While eight other patients have duplicate entries in the log, the remaining 26 are from other districts of Uttar Pradesh, including seven each from Bulandshahr and Ghaziabad, two from Hapur and one from Agra,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/19-persons-falsely-tested-positive-in-gautam-budh-nagar-count-reaches-591-with-21-new-covid-19-cases/story-UpBpiucH1wgK73xUkWiucI.html
07-06-2020||Noida||Pregnant woman dies after being denied treatment by 8 hospitals, DM orders inquiry||A 30-year-old pregnant woman died on Friday evening after she was allegedly denied treatment by at least eight government and private hospitals in Noida and Ghaziabad due to non-availability of beds. Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate, Suhas LY, has ordered an inquiry into the incident.The woman, 30-year-old Neelam, was eight months pregnant and a resident of Azad Vihar in Khoda colony, Ghaziabad. According to the family members, she had complained of breathlessness on Friday morning and was first rushed by her husband in the autorickshaw to ESIC hospital in Noida’s Sector 24 at 6am.“Thereafter our ordeal continued till 7.30pm when she died after we took her for second time to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS). From where we brought her body in an ambulance around midnight to Ghazipur where her last rites were performed. It is our request to all authorities to take steps so that no other woman suffers such a painful death like Neelam,” said Shailendra Kumar, brother-in-law of Neelam. She was driven in an autorickshaw from one hospital to another for about six hours, her family members said. According to the family, they took her to seven hospitals (government and private) in Gautam Budh Nagar and one (Max Hospital in Vaishali) in Ghaziabad.“At ESIC hospital, the staff told us to go to the district hospital in Sector 30. There also she was denied medical help. She had been undergoing treatment at Shivalik hospital in Noida, but it also did not admit her,” said Bijender Singh, the woman’s husband.The family took her to some private hospitals like Fortis in Sector 62, followed by Jaypee hospital in Sector 128 and Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida. The family members alleged that all hospitals denied her treatment citing unavailability of bed. After Sharda, the family took her to the GIMS, then to Max Hospital in Vaishali and finally back to GIMS where she was declared brought dead.“I pleaded the officials at GIMS and then they tried to put her on ventilator but could not save her,” said the husband.When asked, Dr Rakesh Gupta, director, GIMS, said, “They had called us in the evening, but we didn’t have a bed. They came to the hospital in the end, but by then the woman had died.” Shailendra, who owns an auto and drove Neelam, along with her husband, from one hospital to other, said that most of the hospitals denied her admission on pretext that they don’t have vacant beds while some referred her to higher hospitals. “She kept crying in pain in my auto for hours, but I continued to drive her from one hospital to other. I drove her for about six hours in my auto. In between one private hospital arranged for an ambulance when her condition deteriorated further, and I paid Rs 5,800 to the driver,” Shailendra said.Neelam was pregnant for the second time with her first child being a five-year-old son. “She worked at a factory in Sector 58 and also held an ESIC card. So, initially we took her to the ESIC hospital in Sector 24, but they asked us to take her to the district hospital. She was under treatment at Shivalik hospital from May 31 to June 4 when she got discharged. We again took her to the hospital but this time they did not admit her,” said the husband.Taking note of the alleged negligence by the hospitals, the district magistrate called for an inquiry in the matter.“The investigation of the whole case where she died as she was not admitted by several hospitals nor provided treatment has been given to ADM (finance) MN Upadhyay and chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri. They have been asked to take prompt action in the case,” said a statement released by the DM’s office.The family performed the last rites of the woman on Saturday morning.“We have spoken to the family. We will find out what went wrong. Action will be taken against the hospitals if found responsible after a thorough investigation,” said Upadhyay, ADM (finance).Private hospitals have, however, denied any negligence on their part and claim that they were only following procedures.“The emergency doctors said that she had all Covid-19 symptoms like fever and breathlessness. According to instructions given by the government to all private hospitals, we referred her to GIMS ,where Covid patients are treated, after she was counselled and given a referral letter,” said a statement by Jaypee Hospital.Sharda hospital also referred her to an advanced centre. “When she came to us in the afternoon, she was in need of oxygen. She was then stabilised. But there was no space in the ICU, and ICU allotment happens through the office of the CMO. So, she was referred to a higher centre,” said Dr Ajit Kumar, spokesperson, Sharda hospital.In a statement, Fortis hospital said, “The patient was brought in a critical condition around 11am. Doctors advised immediate resuscitation to stabilise her. Due to unavailability of room in ICU isolation ward, she was provided oxygen and nebulised in the waiting area. The husband was counselled and explained the need for resuscitation and transfer to another hospital in an advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) ambulance without delay. However, he refused resuscitation and ventilation support. He also declined our insistence and medical advice for ACLS transfer and the patient was taken from our hospital in an auto.”Meanwhile, the spokesperson from Max Hospital, Vaishali in Ghaziabad said, “As per our records, no such patient was registered in our emergency.”Despite repeated attempts, the district magistrate did not respond to calls.Atul Garg, Uttar Pradesh minister for medical, health and family welfare, and also Bharatiya Janata Party MLA from Ghaziabad, on Saturday evening said that he had no information about the incident.“I will inquire into the incident and get back. Since I am on visit to districts in western UP, I had no information about the case so far,” he said.Vimla Batham, the chairperson of UP state women commission, said that she will get an inquiry done into the incident on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pregnant-woman-dies-after-being-denied-treatment-by-8-hospitals-dm-orders-inquiry/story-oDRFyMKHoM4QLQpRcPRIkM.html
07-06-2020||Chandigarh||Aspiring to join Lawrence Bishnoi gang, student turns shooter, executes firing outside bizman’s house in Chandigarh||Eager to join the Lawrence Bishnoi gang, a 23-year-old Ludhiana youth pursuing hotel management course from a private university in Mohali turned shooter to execute the firing outside a businessman’s house in Sector 33, Chandigarh, on May 31, police said after his arrest on Saturday.Identified as Karan Sharma, he was one of the five men who had fired 17 shots outside the bungalow of hotelier Rakesh Singla, what police said was a targeted attack on his younger brother, liquor baron Arvind Singla.This is the third arrest in the case after Sewak alias, Guri, 25, who lives and runs a gym in Kharar, and Kulwinder Singh, alias Kala, 40, of Sarangpur village were held for their alleged role in the crime. However, Karan is the first shooter to be arrested.“Karan is one of the shooters. The earlier arrests were of people who provided logistical support,” said Manoj Kumar Meena, superintendent of police (SP, crime), Chandigarh.Meena said after committing the crime, Karan was hiding in Mauli Jagran, waiting for further instructions. He was arrested following disclosures made by Sewak. He will be produced in court on Sunday. Bishnoi’s aide gave instructions from jailLawrence Bishnoi, who studied from DAV College, Sector 10, has been running his gang in Punjab, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan from behind the bars. He had even threatened to kill film actor Salman Khan. Investigations revealed that Bishnoi, who is lodged in the Bharatpur jail in Rajasthan, planned the attack and got it executed through his key aide Deepu Banur, who is lodged in the Ambala jail in Haryana.Karan was staying in Banur and studying in a private university. “He got in touch with Deepu Banur through Facebook in February this year, aiming to become a part of the gang,” said a senior police official, privy to the investigations.“It was Deepu who directed Karan to execute the firing along with four other gang members,” said Meena.Karan was reportedly told that if he succeeds, he would become a part of the gang. Though he was also promised money, no payment had been made yet, said sources.To unearth the conspiracy and ascertain the motive, police are now seeking Deepu’s custody.“We have sought his production remand. He is likely to be produced before court on June 9,” said Nilambari Vijay Jagadale, senior superintendent of police (SSP), Chandigarh.Gym owner spilled the beans“Deepu was in direct touch with Sewak, after the two came in contact in the Ambala jail. Sewak had provided logistical support to the Lawrence Bishnoi gang on earlier occasions too,” said sources.Sewak, during his interrogation, allegedly told police that Deepu had called him from jail, asking him to contact Bishnoi for some work. Sewak, in his initial questioning, had told police that he had received a WhatsApp call from Bishnoi, asking him to arrange a vehicle for his men who were coming to Chandigarh for sightseeing. He had then borrowed a Ford Ikon from Gurdeep Singh of Banur and handed it to the men, who executed the shooting. Gurdeep has become an approver for the police, and it was on his statement that Sewak was arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/aspiring-to-join-lawrence-bishnoi-gang-student-turns-shooter-executes-firing-outside-bizman-s-house-in-chandigarh/story-i7edSaVFKzCPceCsZ23WNJ.html
07-06-2020||Pune||PMC to have dashboard with availability of beds in private hospitals||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) will soon start a dashboard to show the availability of beds for both Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients at private hospitals, according to civic officials.Shekhar Gaikwad, PMC commissioner, said, “We will launch the dashboard by Tuesday hopefully and all private hospitals and nursing homes will have to update the dashboard every two to three hours on a daily basis. This will help residents get live updates on the number of beds with and without oxygen, the number of ventilators and ICU beds or even general beds available.”“We had to introduce this dashboard after we got complaints that patients are being neglected treatment or diverted to other hospitals despite beds being available,” said Gaikwad.The dashboard would come up on the PMC website, he added.Since the outbreak of the pandemic, non-Covid-19 patients are either avoiding going to the hospital or have delayed important surgeries. Now, that the state government has ordered a cap on 80 per cent of the beds and critical care services in private hospitals too, it has been found that many private hospitals have been denying treatment to patients or are diverting them to other hospitals. The dashboard will provide real-time data which will be accessible for residents to know the availability of beds and ventilators, said officials.Dr Aarti Nimkar, secretary, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Pune, said, “The dashboard system should work if execution is done properly. The administration should also address problems of the hospitals as there is a fear among doctors of the risk of infection. We, as doctors, also want things to go smoothly during this pandemic.” The civic chief has written a letter, dated June 5, to all private hospitals and nursing homes in the city warning them of strict action against hospitals which deny treatment to Covid-19 and non-Covid patients. The letter states, “Non-Covid-19 patients must get treatment without any delay, be it in private hospitals or nursing homes. Hospitals must ensure timely treatment for patients apart from those suffering from Covid-19 infection. Hospitals must ensure that there is no mortality due to lack of medicines or negligence from the hospital’s side.” On June 1, the district administration formed a committee especially to look into complaints by residents in case of any delay in treatment and any other related complaints. Till date, the district administration has issued show-cause notice to at least two private hospitals after it was found that prima facie the hospitals neglected proper treatment to patients or denied admission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-to-have-dashboard-with-availability-of-beds-in-private-hospitals/story-AdKo7YWhQfL8oxGQT9wBWI.html

While most parts of the Chhawani Mohalla were open and a rush was witnessed on the streets and shops, only three to four streets on the way to Covid-19 casualty’s house have been blocked. Residents were, however, seen moving through the barricades freely with no or limited presence of police and traffic marshals (volunteers). A few non-essential shops were also open in the areas barricaded by the police.The residents, however, demanded that strict action should be taken to stop the movement of the public, otherwise infection might spread in the coming days.A resident of Chhawani Mohalla, Gurdeep Singh, said, “Fear had engulfed the residents after the administration announced the area as a containment zone on Friday and claimed that a curfew-like situation would prevail in the area. But, the authorities failed to implement the norms at the ground level and many residents were moving freely in the area, due to which a threat looms over the area. The shops are open in the area and even many residents are not paying heed to the problem and are moving freely on streets.”Another resident, Harmeet Singh, said, “Family members of deceased Pritpal Singh, who have also tested positive, had been visiting the local gurdwara and one of the family members is also an office-bearer of the gurdwara management committee. But, the gurdwara street was not barricaded by the police and their entire locality is fearing spread of the virus. The police are adopting a casual approach towards the violators, which is a matter of concern.”Deputy commissioner (DC) Pradeep Agrawal said, “Police have been deployed in the area and barricading has also been done. I would take up the matter with the police department for ensuring strict implementation of norms.” The health department had announced Chhawani Mohalla as Ludhiana’s first containment zone on Friday after 15 contacts of deceased Pritpal Singh, 53, who died at the DMC Hospital on May 29, also tested positive of coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-check-on-entry-and-exit-points-at-containment-zone-in-ludhiana/story-iHUZ4kvdbIZwCnHdKwdTqL.html

07-06-2020||Pune||Pune NCL develops indigenous nasopharyngeal swabs for Covid-19 sample collection||The National Chemical Laboratory (NCL) here has successfully developed an indigenous nasopharyngeal (NP) swab for collecting samples from the throat cavity of patients affected with Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) infection.The NCL, a lab under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), will manufacture one lakh nasopharyngeal swabs a day, a press release issued by the organisation said.A team of three scientists, namely, Chandrashekhar V Rode, Dr Prakash P Wadgaonkar and Dr Anuya A Nisal worked on the specifications of nasopharyngeal swab polymers and adhesives. Ashwini Kumar Nangia, director, CSIR-NCL, said, “This is an excellent example of optimising the polymer specifications and validating the chemical analysis of an urgently needed medical swab product in a very short time.”It said that the nasopharyngeal swabs are in huge demand across the globe and therefore, their supplies are not dependable and could result in delays, escalated prices and variable quality. The organisation, therefore, decided to make indigenous nasopharyngeal swabs in mid-April. The nasopharyngeal swab is a medical device with stringent specifications of quality, polymer grade, dimensions and sterilisation.“It consists of a cylindrical plastic stick with a brush-like tip of synthetic bristles/flocks. Flocking is a very important processing step in the manufacture of medical swabs, which is to align the fine bristles in a parallel orientation on the stick head, much like a toothbrush, except that this has round uniform geometry and the nasopharyngeal swab bristles are of micron diameter,” the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-csir-ncl-develops-indigenous-nasopharyngeal-swabs/story-AwFr2jfRngv4LsoUzVyqpM.html

07-06-2020||Chandigarh||‘Sikhs will accept Khalistan if govt offers it’: Akal Takht jathedar||The Sikh community will accept Khalistan, a separate state for Sikhs, if the government offers it, Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh said on Saturday.The jathedar of Akal Takht, the highest temporal seat of the Sikhs, was talking to the media on the 36th anniversary of Operation Bluestar, which was carried out between June 1 and 8 in 1984 to flush out heavily-armed terrorists holed up in the Golden Temple complex.“If the Indian government offers us Khalistan, what else do we need? We will accept it. Which Sikh is there in the world, who doesn’t want it?” he said.Asked about sloganeering at Akal Takht in favour of Khalistan by Sikh hardliners, the jathedar said: “There is nothing wrong in it. But they should have done it after religious programme, which was in progress at the Akal Takht, as sloganeering disrupts the function.” “The vision of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale needs to be alive at this time. So, history of this episode should be penned down,” he added.Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) president Gobind Singh Longowal, who was present during the media interaction, endorsed the jathedar’s stance, saying: “if the government offers it (Khalistan), it will be acceptable to us. When do we refuse to take it? No Sikh can refuse to take it.”Taking on the Centre in context of the Operation Bluestar, the jathedar said: “The Union government’s gesture has remained anti-Sikh for the last 36 years.”Earlier, a bhog ceremony, ardas and kirtan were performed at the Takht in memory of those killed in the Operation Bluestar.During the function, which was held amid heavy rain, the jathedar delivered his sandesh (address) and pointed out to police restrictions for devotees at the Golden Temple. “Sikhs lack unity. This is the why there are these restrictions,” he said, adding: “The community members need to sit together to achieve the goals set by the Sikh leaders in 1984. For this purpose, we need good policy and honesty” he said in the sandesh, while paying tribute to Bhindranwale who led the militants, and other persons killed in the operation. Parallel acting jathedar Dhian Singh Mand, who was present at the complex along with radical Sikh leader Jarnail Singh Sakhira and others, also read out his ‘sandesh’.The function was held amid tight security. In a first, the media was barred from covering the event inside the Golden Temple complex. Restrictions were imposed in the city to prevent gathering in the complex. There was curfew-like situation in the city and all the markets remained almost closed on Saturday.A majority of people in the gathering were SGPC employees and police in plainclothes. Despite making efforts, the police and SGPC staff could not ensure social distancing inside the complex to prevent the spread of Covid-19.Meanwhile, the anniversary was also observed by Sikh seminary Damdami Taksal, which was once headed by Bhindranwale, at its headquarters Chowk Mehta in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/every-sikh-wants-khalistan-will-accept-it-if-government-offers-akal-takht-jathedar/story-GIo3eft11db6YW2K4D4fII.html
