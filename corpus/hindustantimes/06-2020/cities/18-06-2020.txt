Currently, we are reviewing all death cases, as directed by the nodal officers appointed by the Uttar Pradesh government.The review will help us better manage the treatment of patients,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said.“Our prime focus at present is to take up effective surveillance in order to detect patients with severe or acute respiratory illnesses and influenza-like illness (ILI) and immediately send such persons for treatment. In many cases, the deceased had symptoms of fever and breathlessness, besides other comorbid conditions,” the CMO said.According to official records, about 15 of the 32 deaths had one symptom in common -- breathlessness. Fever was also present in 21 fatal cases coupled with other complications.According to the officials, the age group 0 to 20 years is the least affected by the virus with no deaths. The age group of 21-40 years had eight deaths, while 14 deaths were reported in the age group of 41-60 years.

According to the Haryana Shahri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), the nodal agency for contact tracing, on-ground teams are not able to reach the contacts either because families are reluctant to share information or are not responding to telephone calls.“Contacts of many Covid-19 patients go untraced or unattended. If 200 positive cases are reported in a day, we are able to reach out to only 160-170 people,” Jitender Kumar, administrator, HSVP. “Earlier, the problems were incorrect addresses or contact numbers of the patients taken at the time of sample collection, which has been resolved to an extent. But now, many patients don’t respond to the calls by our teams while some don’t share correct information. It affects the overall contact tracing process,” he said.According to him, this issue has been continuing since early June when cases began to surge drastically, with more than 200 Covid-19 cases reported in a day. “The process has been improved now and made systematic,” said Kumar, adding that the number of teams will also be increased for proper surveillance. Currently, there are 99 rapid response teams, each comprising two members.For this, the health department will be helping the HSVP with volunteers. District chief medical officer Dr Virender Yadav, who held a meeting with HSVP officials Wednesday, said volunteers as well as Anganwadi workers are being roped in for contact tracing.“To break the chain of transmission, it is crucial to identify contacts of Covid-positive patients. To not to miss out on this, we are deploying volunteers and Anganwadi workers as well. The work will be divided between different groups. For example, in the first shift which is before lunch, volunteers and the Auxiliary Nurse Midwife will do contact tracing, while in the second half, ASHA and Anganwadi workers will visit Covid-19 positive families to collect details.”Dr Yadav said that the focus is on increasing contact tracing in seven affected areas of the city.On June 1, there were 1,000 Covid cases in the district. This number has now become almost threefold, with a total of 3991 cases by June 18, an increase of almost 3,000 in 17 days. There have been a total of 52 deaths so far in Gurugram due to Covid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-reticent-families-unreachable-patients-make-covid-contact-tracing-challenging/story-pGPraFE0PAB5dktFZjpX6O.html

18-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram to prepare draft for common NCR strategy in 3 days||The Gurugram administration on Thursday said that the district will put together a plan for a common strategy and send it to the Haryana government in the next three days.The move comes after Union home minister Amit Shah on Thursday emphasised the need to have a unified strategy in Delhi-National Capital Region (Delhi-NCR) to tackle the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), adding that suburbs such as Gurugram, Noida and Ghaziabad can’t be separated from the Capital in the public health emergency.Shah held a meeting with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and senior officials of the Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments to review the Covid-19 situation in Delhi-NCR amid a surge in the number of cases of the infectious disease. The deadly virus so far has infected at least 49,979 people in Delhi, 1,173 in Noida (another 85 cross-notified), 757 in Ghaziabad and 3,991 in Gurugram. “The Centre has asked us to provide the data related to bed capacity and testing facility for the common Delhi-NCR strategy. Gurugram will hit its peak number of Covid cases in June-July for which we have to prepared. Also, patients from Delhi are even admitted in Gurugram’s hospital. Those details have to be collected,” said a state government official. “In view of the structure of Delhi-NCR region, all concerned bodies need to unite and work on a common strategy against the coronavirus pandemic. In this context, I met with Delhi Chief Minister and senior officials of Center and Delhi-NCR today to discuss how to evolve a strategy as soon as possible,” Shah tweeted.During the meeting, the state government was appreciated for the Covid-19 management in Gurugram. The health secretary, union ministry of health and family welfare, said that the district’s Covid-19 helpline number is user- friendly, while isolation centres set up residents’ welfare association (RWA) for Covid-19 is a unique model which Delhi should also consider.As reported by the HT earlier, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and Haryana —which together make NCR — have failed to share or pool healthcare infrastructure and not tried to evolve a common strategy, even as cases in all the three regions continue to spike. During Thursday’s review meeting, officials from Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat and Jhajjar districts of Haryana were present. Officials from Meerut, Ghaziabad, Baghpat and Gautam Budh Nagar also attended the meeting.To prepare a collective strategy, a proforma has been shared with the districts adjoining Delhi to provide the information regarding testing, hospital infrastructure and ambulances.

Once complete, the underpass will allow motorists to take a U-turn at Rajokri to reach Ambience Mall and DLF Phase-3 without having to go all the way to Delhi. The work on the underpass had started on March 5, 2019 while September 4, 2020 was fixed as the deadline. However, a ban on construction last November due to air pollution and the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 24 to contain the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease had stalled the work on the project twice. Construction resumed on April 30 after the government had announced certain relaxations in the lockdown.NHAI officials said that low traffic volume due to the lockdown helped in construction work as workers did not have keep one eye on vehicular movement or making traffic diversions. On an average, around four lakh vehicles crossed the Sirhaul border on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway daily before the imposition of lockdown, said NHAI officials. Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI, said that almost 80% of the work on the underpass at Sirhaul toll plaza and the flyover at Shankar Chowk is complete. “The work on the underpass and the flyover project has been on an upswing as the lack of heavy traffic has helped us to singularly focus on construction work. Nearly 75% to 80% of the work has been completed. We are confident of completing the project by July 31,” he said. Sharma also said that while work on a couple of other NHAI projects in the city had suffered due to the exodus of migrant workers to other states, the contractors at the Sirhaul U-turn underpass and flyover project site were able to retain the construction workers and also get new workers hired. “The retention of workers and the low traffic flow have helped speed up work. This underpass and flyover are going to significantly reduce traffic congestion at this busy junction”, he said. The length of the U-turn underpass is 377 metres. It has a 559-metre-long and 7-metre-wide service road. The designated speed in this underpass is set at 40kmph, said Sharma.The flyover at Shankar Chowk, on the other hand, will help traffic coming from the Cyber City to cross the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway and turn towards Delhi. This grade-separated flyover has been designed for a motorable speed of 30kmph. It will be 455 metre-long with three lanes on each side. The total cost of the project is estimated at ₹161 crore and it is being built as a part of the plan to reduce congestion on highways across the National Capital Region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/low-traffic-helps-speed-up-sirhaul-u-turn-underpass-project-likely-to-be-completed-by-july-31/story-fNnOBKFkxeQc9o1afsBo5O.html

The total funds outlay entails ₹2,925 crore.Expressing concern of the possibility of the pandemic posing a hurdle to the plan, local bodies minister Brahm Mohndra said, “The government is already spending a huge amount in the fight against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). It is to be seen how much fund is to be given to each constituency. There are suggestions that not all constituencies need the same amount, so discussions are on to fix upper limit of expenditure to Rs. 25 crore.”The state finance department has been asked to make arrangements for funds. “It is to be seen how much funds are available and how loans would be raised,” said a state functionary. The state has received ₹2,800 crore as GST reimbursement from the Centre and a portion of these funds are expected to go for development. “Development is the main agenda of our government and people also expect that development should take place. It is the government’s responsibility to muster funds whatever the situation is,” said state congress chief Sunil Jakhar. WHO’S INCHARGE IN NON-CONG CONSTITUENCIES The ruling party has 80 MLAs and all of them have been involved in the development exercise. However, in case of 37 constituencies with non-Congress MLAs, the government is yet to decide on the points-person. Informed sources said that the CM and state congress party chief would take a call. “I think it has to be someone from the party as opposition MLAs would not let the work go smoothly,” said a government functionary.Other than Congress MLAs, there are 19 of the Aam Aadmi Party, 14 of the Shiromani Akali Dal and two each of the Bharatiya Janata Party and Lok Insaaf Party.The Akali-BJP government had launched a similar programme in 2008 and 2016 before the state polls, setting aside ₹25 crore for each constituency||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capt-govt-plans-25-cr-development-push-for-each-assembly-constituency/story-Fwgzwjdvt3snZm1BHJmebL.html

18-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad: Magisterial inquiry ordered into death of 66-year-old Covid patient||Ghaziabad: The district magistrate has directed for a magisterial inquiry into the death of a 66-year-old coronavirus (Covid-19)-positive woman who was allegedly referred from a private hospital to an L3-category Covid hospital in an ambulance which was without any life support equipment. The woman was declared dead upon arrival by doctors who examined her in the ambulance when it reached the L3 facility late on June 16.The woman, who lived at New Gandhi Nagar in Ghaziabad, had been admitted to Sarvodaya Hospital located in Kavi Nagar Industrial Area on June 13. According to her family members, doctors at the hospital allegedly showed undue haste to refer her to an L3 facility, in an ordinary ambulance without any life support equipment.“She had diabetes and had fever for a couple of days before that. Her oxygen saturation was also low. After a lot of deliberation we got her admitted to Sarvodaya Hospital, after which she was admitted to an ICU and immediately put on a ventilator, even though she did have respiratory issues at the time. Her sample was taken on June 14 and her reports arrived June 15, confirming her to be Covid-positive,” the sister-in-law of the patient alleged.“On June 16 around 10.30pm, the hospital informed us that she needs to be shifted to an L3 Covid hospital. They had also arranged for an ambulance but it was a normal ambulance which only had a stretcher. They told us the patient will be brought downstairs to the ambulance with the aid of an air pump for oxygen supply. We repeatedly denied that she should not be shifted at night but they insisted. In the ambulance, there were only two men,” she added.The district magistrate has assigned the inquiry to city magistrate Shiv Prakash Shukl.“The inquiry has been directed and is to be completed in seven days. We will now seek replies from all concerned parties and a report will be submitted to the district magistrate,” the city magistrate said.The L3 Covid facility, Santosh Medical hospital, is a government acquired facility. Its medical superintendent Dr Manish Sabharwal did not take calls.The son of the deceased woman alleged laxity on part of the staff members of Sarvodaya Hospital.“During discussions with the officials of L3 hospital, it was decided that an ambulance with a ventilator will be arranged for shifting her in the morning of June 17. However, on the night of June 16, I got a call from Sarvodaya Hospital informing us that shifting is to take place that night itself. We suspect that something happened to my mother at the hospital which is why they were bent on shifting her the same evening. They made us sign the discharge papers. We didn’t realise what was happening. My mother was brought down and taken to an L3 hospital in an ordinary ambulance,” he added.The distance between the two hospitals is about seven to eight kilometres.When contacted, Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said, “All the issues pertaining to the case will be taken up during the magisterial inquiry.”Dr Amit Goel, the administration in-charge of Sarvodaya Hospital denied all allegations.“The shifting of the patient took place after we received an email from the office of the chief medical officer’s Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) unit for shifting the patient, around 8.43pm on June 16. Before shifting, we also took written consent of the family and the final bill was also given. Three of our staff members, including one doctor, went with her in the ambulance. For about 30 minutes, the guard of L3 hospital did not allow the ambulance to enter the hospital. After the issue was resolved, the ambulance was let in,” Dr Goel said.He added that the patient was in a gasping state with heavy diabetes, and had low oxygen saturation of about 30-31% when she was admitted on June 13.“She was on ventilator since the night of June 13 and tested positive on June 15. We had also told the family that we did not have any ventilator fitted ambulance. The family had also given us written consent for treatment on June 13,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-magisterial-inquiry-ordered-into-death-of-66-year-old-covid-patient/story-zLPXkTxozdZsTccETDaRwK.html

Nearly 10,000 tests have been conducted daily in the past few days as compared to 4,000-4,500 a day in the first week of the month.SURPASSES HARYANAPunjab on Thursday surpassed Haryana in total number of tests done, with the neighouring state’s tally reaching 1,97,703 on Wednesday. On June 3, Haryana with a total of 1,26,222 tests was far ahead of Punjab which had conducted 1,01,036 tests by then. As per claims by health department officials, after Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, Punjab was the only state to have conducted more than 1 lakh tests in the last 15 days.The health officials claim that while testing in most states decreased with the surge in cases, Punjab kept increasing its capacity. “Testing in the worst-hit states like Delhi and Gujarat has decreased whereas we have increased the same,” said a senior health official. State Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said Punjab’s testing per million increased to 6,867 on Wednesday (June 17) while the number was 4,644 on June 13, and 3,096 on June 3. “There is no data of other states available as of now but I am sure we have surpassed Haryana and we are among top four in testing per million,” Dr Bhaskar added.Figures also suggest that the state is not relying much on private laboratories for sample testing as 98% of the testing was done in government facilities.Of the private players, only PathLabs conducted tests in Punjab at a time when state witnessed a sudden surge in positive cases with the return of Sikh pilgrims from Maharshtra’s Nanded. WHO ALL ARE BEING TESTED?Besides contacts of those found positive and people coming from outside the state, all frontline workers of the health and police departments, pregnant women, high-risk patients and patients reporting to the flu corners are being tested.“Our next objective is to test vegetable vendors and others involved in providing essential services to people during the lockdown,” said the nodal officer. Health and family welfare minister Balbir Sidhu said the department is planning to increase testing it further in coming days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-crosses-2-lakh-test-count-half-conducted-in-last-fortnight/story-GjfdiVCaJYbhcmHxdCkN8I.html

All of them are daily wagers. Raids are on to nab the two absconding suspects, said deputy commissioner of police (southeast) RP Meena.“The two families often quarrelled over petty issues and fought over one issue or the other. One such fight led to the death of Najeem,” said Meena.On Monday around 6 pm, the DCP said, Najeem’s relatives – Dilshad,35, and his 30-year-old wife Nagma – were outside their home when their neighbours started quarrelling with them. Dilshad told the police that his neighbour, Zakir, began hurling abuses at them. When Dilshad’s brother-in-law Mujeeb protested, Sakir called his associate Shahid and they assaulted him with iron rods and sticks.“The altercation and clash continued for more than two hours and during that period Zakir and his four associates attacked Dilshad, Nagma, Mujeeb and Najeem, who was also stabbed in his abdomen,” said a police officer, associated with the case.The four injured persons were admitted to a government hospital where Najeeb died during treatment on Tuesday.

Yamunanagar civil surgeon Dr Vijay Dahiya said, “The man, a cloth merchant, had tested positive on June 13. He was undergoing treatment at ESI hospital in Yamunanagar’s Jagadhri, but referred to Mullana the next day after he experienced difficulty in breathing. He was on oxygen support in Mullana, where his condition considerably improved, but he committed suicide.”Ambala police said his body was handed over to the Yamunanagar administration following due procedures. “We received a call from the hospital authorities in the morning and the family was informed.

18-06-2020||City||Delhi HC asks visually impaired students of DU to try and sit for open book online exam||New Delhi: The Delhi High has asked final-year undergraduate and postgraduate visually impaired students of Delhi University (DU) to endeavour to sit for the open book online exam, while staing that the cost of any book or assistive device they buy for the examination will be reimbursed up to Rs 2 lakh.A bench of Justices Rajiv Sahai Endlaw and Asha Menon directed that as and when a second round of open book exam is held, which according to DU would be in September, the visually impaired students would be entitled to appear in them to improve their score even if they have taken the first round of exams that will start from July 2.A slew of directions were issued by the high court while hearing a plea by the National Federation of the Blind filed through senior advocate SK Rugnta, challenging DU’s decision to hold open book examinations on the grounds that it violated rights of students with visual impairments and other disabilities.The Federation had wanted DU to assess performance of the final-year disabled students on the basis of their performance in previous semesters and internal assessment. In the alternative, it had suggested holding offline exams for such students after colleges reopen.Listing the matter for further hearing on July 13, the bench in its order of June 17 directed the DU, UGC and the Centre to file their replies to the petition before the next date.The court directed that “the visually impaired students may approach their respective institutes/colleges for any assistance required, including reading material/text books in accessible form and assistive devices.“Upon any student so approaching the institute/college of DU, the said institute and/or college is directed to supply the reading material/ text books in accessible form and the assistive devices.”The high court said that if any visually impaired student approaches DU for assistance in arranging a scribe to take their examination, the varsity has to “make best efforts” for arranging it.The bench made it clear that merely because the visually impaired students participated in the open book examination scheduled to commence from July 2, it would not disentitle them to the relief, if ultimately granted, of assessment on the basis of performance in the earlier semester and /or on the basis of internal assessment. “The DU and all its affiliate institutes/colleges are directed to, notwithstanding the aforesaid, as and when approached by any visually impaired students for any assistance, to render all such assistance and in the event of any such assistance being denied, such visually impaired students may contact Prof. Vinay Gupta, Dean (Examination) of DU in that respect,” the high court said. The high court had earlier said it was not going to interfere with DU’s decision to hold open book exams as the varsity has also decided to hold offline physical exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-hc-asks-visually-impaired-students-of-du-to-try-and-sit-for-open-book-online-exam/story-B8iInAp0m6SMlQt6kid9pN.html

18-06-2020||City||Delhi high court tells north MCD to clear teachers’ salaries||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Thursday directed the North Delhi Municipal to clear within a week the arrears of salaries of teachers who have not been paid since lockdown started in March, stating that “they cannot be made to run from pillar to post for their lawful dues”. A bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad also rejected the contention of the civic body that it was not being able to give salaries due to the paucity of funds and termed it “most unacceptable”.“We are of the opinion that the teachers cannot be made to run from pillar to post only to demand their lawful dues from the North DMC. Admittedly, the North DMC appears to be in default and has not released the salaries to the appellants/teachers since the lockdown was declared,” the bench said.The court was hearing a plea filed by the Akhil Dilli Prathmik Shikshak Sangh, representing the teachers who are teaching in North DMC schools, through its counsel Ranjit Sharma. In their plea, the teachers have contended that they have not got salaries since March. They said they were forced to approach the Delhi High Court because the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT) was not functional.Appearing for the North DMC, its counsel told the court that the CAT was hearing urgent matters. She said the civic body is facing a paucity of funds and has not been able to disburse the salaries.The court said, “The explanation sought to be offered about the paucity of funds, is most unacceptable, particularly when the counsel for North DMC is not in a position to make a statement that on account of a cash crunch faced by the civic authority, it could not release the salaries of its officers working within the department or that the salaries have been partly released. The axe cannot fall on the appellants/ teachers alone”.The plea had challenged a June 9 order of a single judge dismissing their plea to direct North DMC to release their salaries that have not been paid since March 2020, when a nationwide lockdown was declared by the Central Government on account of the Covid-19 pandemic. The Sangh told the high court that the teachers had been discharging their duties with responsibility in schools being run by the North DMC, but they have not received their salaries ever since March.The bench listed the matter for June 26 and asked the North DMC to file a compliance report of its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-high-court-tells-north-mcd-to-clear-teachers-salaries/story-PzK2E1azuxscuOHieiJiEI.html
18-06-2020||Mumbai||Report pending Covid deaths within 48 hours or face action: BMC to hospitals||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Thursday issued a warning to all hospitals in its jurisdiction to report any pending Covid-19 deaths within the next 48 hours or face action. The directive was issued two days after the Maharashtra government added 862 Covid-19 deaths, which were previously not counted, to Mumbai’s cumulative death toll. The official communication to hospitals issued on Friday, read, “… one last and final chance is given to all hospitals under the jurisdiction of MCGM to come out clean and report any Covid-positive deaths if still pending for reporting for more than 48 hours.” BMC also stated that these instructions apply to all cases henceforth. The warning was meant for all civic and state-run hospitals as well as private ones.The document further said, “In case of failure to follow these instructions, a serious note will be taken by MCGM, and action under the Epidemic Act will be initiated.”The warning comes a day after municipal commissioner IS Chahal told Hindustan Times that BMC would not take any action in the form of a show-cause notice or FIR against its staff, hospitals, or their deans for the late reportage of these 862 deaths.“How can I blame my officers? They did not lie. Action will not be taken against hospitals and deans either, because the hospitals will collapse. Whatever said, I will not take action against BMC officials,” Chahal had said on Wednesday.BMC also issued an official clarification on Thursday regarding the reconciliation of Covid death figures in Mumbai that added 862 deaths to its cumulative figure. It claimed the late reportage of deaths was due to a shortage of staff and limitations in means of communication.The clarification further said that on June 6, the municipal commissioner carried out a thorough investigation after a private hospital reported 17 deaths to BMC in a single day. When it was observed that only one death had taken place that day and 16 deaths were from earlier, all private and public hospitals were instructed on June 8 to reconcile pending death figures and submit them within 48 hours.Responding to the Opposition’s accusations of hiding these numbers, BMC’s clarification said, “Another important point to be stressed here is that even before some people started expressing doubts about the concealment of this information, the municipal corporation had already collected the information, verified it, corrected the errors, and submitted it to the government. There were great proactive efforts on the part of the municipal corporation to bring these facts before the people in a transparent and spontaneous manner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/report-pending-covid-deaths-within-48-hours-or-face-action-bmc-to-hospitals/story-jFjRzBY7ehOXg2D9gjKTBM.html
18-06-2020||Delhi||70% JNU teachers feel online education cannot replicate classroom learning: Report||Even as digital education gains prominence during the Covid-19 lockdown, over 70% of 131 teachers who participated in a survey at Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) said online education cannot replicate classroom learning. The findings were published in a report prepared by two former JNU teachers’ association (JNUTA) presidents, Ayesha Kidwai and Atul Sood.“More than 70% of teachers do not think online education successfully replicates the offline in-person classroom in terms of students’ needs and attainments or creates the conditions for a particularly smooth or fair exercise for the instructor,” the report said. Out of 576 teachers in the varsity, the report states that 310 faculty members were involved in online education, according to the administration. Kidwai said that the online form was circulated in the university and 131 teachers responded to the survey designed to assess the shortcomings of the online education system and problems faced by students.According to data submitted by the varsity to MHRD in April, only 35.6% male students and 29.7% female students participated in online education due to a lack of access to the internet, stable bandwidth and requisite devices, the report states.JNU V-C Jagadesh Kumar did not respond to calls and messages sent by HT seeking his response on the matter.“Teachers can only conduct exams after teaching has been done. If a student doesn’t have a laptop or internet and cannot receive what I am sending, it is not fair to conduct their examinations online or offline,” said Kidwai, who teaches at the Centre for Linguistics, School of Language, Literature and Culture Studies. Atul Sood teaches at JNU’s School of Social Sciences. Kidwai also pointed out that several students staying in hostels were sent back to their homes where they don’t have the necessary infrastructure to access online education.“We are not asking students to come back to the campus risking their health. But institutional practices have to be put in place to facilitate learning. Sending a paper or email is not just online teaching. This is not viable in the long run,” she added.The recommendations listed in the report include procurement of an institutional licence for online meetings and instructions for the use of teachers and students, a reformulated programme curriculum at Centres and Schools approved by statutory bodies, and allocation of special funds to students from socially and economically disadvantaged sections for digital devices and internet connectivity. The report calls for limiting the scope of ongoing PhDs since Covid-19 pandemic has made fieldwork-based research difficult.The report recommended a prolonged academic session and delayed admissions. “About two-thirds of the teachers (66.2%) agree admissions for the academic year 2020-21 should be delayed until January 2021 ... An overwhelming percentage of teachers (above 70%) were in support of extending the semester from 45 to 60 days after the date of reopening and conducting in-class evaluations both for continuing and final-year students,” it said.The report also called for immediate discussion at both informal levels as well as in official statutory bodies including student-faculty committee members, board of studies, and academic council, with the full involvement of student representatives. “It is important that these meetings be held on a video-conferencing platform so that colleagues may actually converse and debate in real-time,” the report said.JNU students’ union vice-president Saket Moon said, “Online learning or exams cannot be made mandatory due to the digital divide and lack of access to internet. Students who don’t have access should also be accommodated in some way. Administration should facilitate access before pushing for online education.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/70-jnu-teachers-feel-online-education-cannot-replicate-classroom-survey-report/story-fnccAN0Atmuctg5K7MPkOK.html
18-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi to use school auditoriums to add beds||As a part of its plan to augment the bed count in the face of the Covid-19 crisis, the Delhi government will make use of its school auditoriums.Earlier this month, the government had asked its schools to submit data on whether they have auditoriums or not. They were also asked to provide details such as existing air conditioning facilities, whether the auditorium had fixed chairs, among other things.On Wednesday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that the government planned to use auditoriums in nearly 242 schools to set up beds for Covid-19 patients.There are a total of 8,872 isolation beds in the city’s hospitals. Sisodia had earlier estimated that Delhi will need at least 15,000 beds by June-end and 80,000 by the end of July. The government also plans to use 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls as makeshift hospitals, a move that is expected to add over 15,800 beds.“This is not an ideal scenario but if the need arises, we have to work together to fight the pandemic and provide the required space to accommodate presidents,” said the principal of a government school in south Delhi, requesting anonymity.Sisodia requested the Union minister to cancel the remaining CBSE board exams for classes 10 and 12 slated in July and promote all students based on their internal assessment citing rising cases of Covid-19 in the national capital.“Holding exams in the same building where there are hundreds of Covid-19 patients will be a serious risk,” the Delhi education minister had written in a letter to Union human resource minister on Wednesday.So far, around 251 government schools in Delhi are currently being used as dry ration distribution centres, 33 schools have been converted into hunger relief centres, 39 as shelter homes, 10 as migrant camps and another 10 as quarantine centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-use-school-auditoriums-to-add-beds/story-fvUuAFNx5bO03owJPpWFdL.html
18-06-2020||Mumbai||Melghat Tiger Reserve reopens for tourists||The Maharashtra forest department has decided to reopen the Melghat Tiger Reserve (MTR) from today while the buffer area of Pench and Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserves (TATR) will be reopened from July 1.Located across the eastern Vidarbha landscape, spreading across northern Amravati district and etching into Buldhana and Akola districts, the 1,500.49 square kilometre MTR, is home to five wildlife sanctuaries. It will be the first protected area in the state to resume operations since all wildlife sanctuaries, national parks, and tiger reserves were shut due to the Covid-19 pandemic, since March 18. “The decision was taken as a complete ban on tourism activities had led to serious negative economic impacts during the lockdown on local people and their families depending on tourism,” said MS Reddy, additional principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) and field director, Melghat Tiger Reserve.On June 15, Shiv Sena politician and member of Parliament (Lok Sabha) Prataprao Jadhav had written to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray requesting him to resume nature tourism at Melghat, citing financial difficulties for nature guides, drivers, restaurant operators, labourers, and their families due to the reserve being shut. HT has a copy of the letter.Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), said, “While there was a demand from local leaders to open up tourism at Melghat, the National Tiger Conservation Authority on June 5 had allowed states to take a call on resuming tourism at reserves where Covid-19 cases are relatively less. However, we have reiterated that restricted tourism will be allowed in the buffer areas of Pench and TATR, and it will increase gradually in a phased manner.”Protected areas across other parts of the state, including Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Mumbai, will continue to remain shut for now, added Kakodkar. “I am awaiting a report from local officers as the Covid-19 problem in Mumbai and Pune is much more severe, and therefore we are not in a rush. A decision will be taken next week,” he said.Meanwhile, a list of regulations has been put in place for tourists and staff at MTR to follow during safaris at the park. They include taking note of the travel history of visitors, screening of tourists and forest staff, social distancing norms while being seated in vehicles, limited number of vehicles entering the reserve, recurrent use of sanitisers during the safari, mandatory sanitisation of vehicles before entering the park, all persons to wear masks, gloves, and other personal protective equipment at all times.“We will ensure not more than six vehicles enter the reserve daily. If anyone is found having Covid symptoms, they will be isolated and taken to the local health department for examination,” said a senior forest official from MTR, adding, “Safari reservations are offline to ensure tourists are present in person at the time of making the booking. All staff members have to report any incidents of ill-health.”Three arrested for hunting monitor lizard in MelghatForest officials at the Melghat Tiger Reserve arrested three persons on Wednesday for hunting a monitor lizard, which is protected under schedule I of the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972. All three will be presented before a local court on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/melghat-tiger-reserve-reopens-for-tourists/story-dWjeYv18obqphGstcxVOQK.html

18-06-2020||Chandigarh||Couple hacked to death in Rohtak; 21 murders reported in district since May 1||Haryana’s Rohtak has witnessed a sharp rise in murder cases since May 1. With a couple being hacked to death, the tally rose to 21 on Thursday. A 19-year-old woman and her husband from Rohtak’s Farmana village were murdered in what police claimed to be a case honour killing. “The victims had married last year against the wishes of their families. They lived at a safe house in Rohtak for some time as well. On Thursday, the woman, who was severely injured, approached the government hospital in Meham and told the doctors that her family members had attacked them. She said her brother had stabbed her. She died on the way to Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak. In the evening, her husband’s body was also found,” assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Kuldeep Singh said. THREE PERSONS ARRESTEDRohtak superintendent of police Rahul Sharma said they have arrested three persons — woman’s brother Ajay Kumar and his two friends Sahil and Bablu — in connection with the case.“We have formed a special investigation team to be led by Meham DSP. During questioning, Ajay confessed that he had brought his sister Pooja and her husband Surender from Rohtak, where they were living in a rented accommodation, to Meham. From there, he and his two aides took the couple to Bhiwani’s Badesra village on Wednesday evening. They first attacked Pooja with a knife, but she managed to escape while her husband was stabbed to death on the spot. We will interrogate the accused further to ascertain involvement of other persons,” he added.‘MOST KILLINGS RESULT OF FAMILY DISPUTES, PERSONAL ENMITY’Among the murders reported in past almost 50 days are those of a woman who was stabbed by her husband in Bhani Maharajpur village, a man who was shot in Bhali village, another man who was killed in a similar manner by his friends in Bhani Bheron village, a convict out on bail who was gunned down and a woman and her daughter who were burnt alive by her husband in Salara Mohalla. SP Rahul Sharma said most of these murders were the result of either family dispute or personal enmity. “We have arrested the perpetrators in 15 murder cases so far. We are working hard to prevent contract killings and planned murders. Our main job is to detect crime and we have been doing that efficiently,” the SP added.

The high court had termed the use of derogatory terms like “kala” or “Negro” to address black people of African-origin as highly offensive and unacceptable and asked the state’s director general of police (DGP) to issue instructions and sensitise cops against it. The court had taken note of police using term ‘Negro’ while referring to an African person in the challan papers presented before the trial court in a drugs seizure case. The court was told that the DGP has issued instructions to all investigating officers and other officers in the field to never use offensive or racial words in FIRs and challans etc.The police also told the court that the word in question was neither used by policemen nor was it part of proceedings prepared by them, but was a disclosure statement of an accused, which was part of the challan. The police officials, while recording the statement of complainant/witnesses/accused persons cannot make any changes in the language or narrative version being dictated either by the complainant/witnesses/accused persons, on their own as per the apex court order on recording of evidence, the court was informed. “This aspect needs to be corrected by sanction of the law by ordering strict action against the policemen who indulge in this character assassination based on physical features,” the bench of justice RN Raina had said in its June 12 order as it found that “the term ‘Negro’ (was) used while referring to an African national in the challan papers”.The police told the court that all field heads have been asked to sensitise the SHOs and other policemen.

In a letter to the PM, Amarinder said the PPE manufacturers rose to the occasion in the wake of the Covid outbreak to make Punjab self-reliant in the production of this critical equipment needed by frontline warriors to fight the pandemic. “Permitting them to export the PPE body coveralls will also give an impetus to the Atma Nirbhar Bharat Abhiyan recently launched by the Centre,” he said. A total of 128 firms in Punjab have been given approval for production of PPE.Citing the surplus capacity, the CM said there was not enough domestic demand of PPE at present. “The manufacturers are finding it difficult to obtain orders. Of the 128 approved manufacturers, only 18 units have received orders from the Centre,” he said. The approved manufacturers have a cumulative current capacity to make 5.21 lakh PPE coveralls daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ppe-makers-fail-to-get-orders-capt-urges-pm-to-allow-export/story-iNzuj6ae255Y46sPZvkOjI.html

This decision is against the sentiments of the Sikh community and should be withdrawn immediately,” he said.The Akali leader said hundreds of crores had been spent to establish these memorials which came up during the SAD-BJP tenure. It is shocking that the Congress government is not even ready to maintain them now and is handing them over to private parties for exploitation at will. The SAD will not allow this to happen under any cost. The sanctity of the memorials, which are associated with events of particular historic significance for Sikhs worldwide, should be respected. I urged chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh to intervene and ensure this decision is reversed at the earliest”.Cheema said this was not the first time that the Congress government had tried to forsake its responsibility towards heritage memorials. He said former tourism minister Navjot Singh Sidhu had referred to the Virasat-e-Khalsa museum as a white elephant. The government should understand that it had a social and moral obligation to maintain the heritage memorials for future generations, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-slams-govt-s-move-to-hand-over-heritage-memorials-to-pvt-parties/story-VOfbnzFzyl8orDQbTf7jVO.html
18-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab to install CCTVs, sound systems in 5,456 schools; seeks funds from Centre||The Punjab government has decided to install closed-circuit television (CCTV) cameras and public address systems in all its schools to ensure children’s safety.The school education department, which started releasing funds for having this apparatus in some schools a few weeks before the coronavirus-induced national lockdown was imposed in the start three months ago, has sought Rs 7.5 crore from the Centre for installation of CCTVs and public address systems in 5,456 schools across the state.The installation of CCTVs and public address systems has been proposed in the annual work plan and budget (AWP&B) for the financial year 2020-21 submitted to the Union ministry of human resource development (MHRD) about 10 days ago under the centrally- sponsored ‘Samagra Shiksha Abhiyan’. The proposal will come up for discussion before the project approval board headed by the Union school education and literacy secretary Anita Karwal in about 10 days.As per the proposal, CCTV cameras will be installed in 1,796 government schools across the state under the ‘Safe School-Safe Child’ programme. “The need of the hour is to ensure our children are secure and feel safe. Vigilance and keeping an eye out for any anomaly or deviations in their behaviour is something that we can all do to fortify ourselves in this fight,” reads the proposal.A school education department official said that CCTV cameras will be installed in all 19,000-odd government schools in stages, starting with girls’ schools, sensitive schools from where complaints have been received, and then all co-educational schools. “Some schools have installed CCTV cameras with their funds. We also released funds a few months ago, but the installation process got delayed due to the coronavirus outbreak,” he said.The CCTV cameras will be installed at school gates, corridors and spots that need to be monitored, but not in classrooms. In Delhi, the Kejriwal government’s move to install CCTV cameras in classrooms last year had sparked off a controversy with some parents and teachers raising objections. In addition to CCTVs, the Punjab school education department also plans to install a public address system in 3,660 high and senior secondary schools this year for emergency broadcasting and other announcements.FOCUS ON ENGLISH DICTION, VOCABULARYThe department, in its annual plan proposal, has also laid emphasis on new initiatives to improve the English reading, listening, and pronunciation skills of students of government schools across the state. It plans to establish listening labs in primary schools to begin with and then have more for higher classes to foster their listening skills and improve pronunciation. Another proposal sent to the HRD ministry is for the distribution of student edition of English newspapers free of cost to students of 3,660 high and senior secondary schools to inculcate the reading skills among them, besides improving their knowledge of current affairs. The state authorities have proposed a budget of Rs 12.6 crore for this activity during the current academic year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-to-install-cctvs-sound-systems-in-5-456-schools-seeks-funds-from-centre/story-1i3IgJi7x9ty3WGNVQRW8H.html

In May-end, the university had decided to conduct online examination starting with the final-semester students, a varsity official said.The survey, prepared by the varsity’s controller of examinations, was divided into two parts. In the first, feedback of the final-semester students was sought while the rest of the pupils were asked to share their views in the second. All students were to submit their response by June 10.As many as 9,936 final-semester students participated in the survey. Of these, 6,462 (65%) gave their consent to appear in the traditional mode of examination while 3,494 (34.96%) said they were in favour of appearing in the online exam. In the second part, a total of 30,697 students of other semesters submitted their response. Of these, 24,323 (79%) wanted to appear in the traditional mode of examination while only 6,374 (21%) said the July semester exams be held in January 2021 in the traditional format.Also, the varsity has sought feedback from parents on starting classes from August 1.A PTU official said they have received a revised academic calendar from the University Grants Commission (UGC) which recommended starting of classes from August but the decision will be taken only after consulting the parents and getting approval from the Punjab government.Majority of the nearly 300 parents whose feedback was received said they were ready to send their wards to the colleges only if proper Covid-19 protocol is followed, it is learnt.The state government has announced that it will take the final decision on conducting examinations after June 30.PTU vice-chancellor (V-C) Prof Ajay Kumar Sharma said, “The students have to understand that they are pursuing professional courses which are industry-oriented. Promotion to the next semester or passing exams without appearing in the ones can become roadblocks during their placements.”“We will take a decision after the UGC and the state government take a call on the issue,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/july-semester-three-fourths-of-ptu-students-not-in-favour-of-online-exams/story-O755i4SiG0EvbQ2jMjJTQP.html

18-06-2020||City||Lockdown halts Mohali MC’s animal birth control programme||Indifference of the municipal corporation of Mohali has blown the stray dog menace in the city out of proportions. In the wake of the lockdown, not a single dog was sterilised between March 21 and now, leading to an increase in the population of canines.On a rough estimate, the number of stray dogs increased by 1,000 in the past year. In June last year, the number was around 9,000, which is now around 10,000.On the other hand, Mohali has witnessed 2,010 dog bite cases in the past five months. The maximum number of cases, 350, were reported in May this year. The worst affected areas include Sectors 76 to 80, Phases 9, 10, 4, 3B1, 3B2 and 5. In 2017, the dog bite cases were 1,970, in 2018 the figure was 2,340 and last year, the figure was 3,532.Sham Lal, MC sanitary inspector, said sterilisation was stopped due to the lockdown and will be restarted within a week.In October last year, the then chairman of the animal birth control (ABC) committee, Kuljeet Singh Bedi, in a report had stated that the sterilisation process was only on papers. It has been observed that in the last two years, the previous company had not been operating upon the stray dogs, but performing dummy operations, the report said.CL Garg, president of the Confederation of Greater Mohali Resident Welfare Association, an apex body of 65 RWAs, said, “It has been more than three weeks since the lockdown was opened, but the MC has not resumed the sterilisation programme. Some dogs are quiet, while others can be ferocious or infected. Even when MC officials do come, they merely perform a formality.”Nodal officer Dr Harmandeep Kaur Brar at civil hospital, Phase 6, said, “Dog bite patients have to undergo physical torture. Sometimes it can cause Rabies which can be a horror for the patient’s as they become hydrophobic to an extent that even injecting Glucose drip on them is difficult.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lockdown-halts-mohali-mc-s-animal-birth-control-programme/story-MEm9O67SyLaDLyvM7gPfyJ.html

Morning-evening walkers, joggers, yoga enthusiasts, recreational footballers or cricketers have begun resuming their chosen activity at parks they used to frequent before the March 24 lockdown.Though the footfall at the parks – like Janeshwar Mishra Park or Lohia Park – is just minuscule compared to pre-lockdown times, the turnout is slowly and steadily rising with each passing day.Most parks threw open their gates to people June 1 onwards although only for four hours each in the morning and evening: from 5 am to 8 am and then 5 pm to 8 pm.Right at the gate, long banners with a longer set of instructions, dos and don’ts greeted visitors, but one trip inside the parks makes it clear that not all visitors stick to those guidelines. One can easily spot many senior citizens returning to their park routines. However, the very first instruction says ‘Those above the age of 65, those with comorbidities, and children below 10, not allowed’.“No Sir, we do not ask them to go back. If they have come back to their routines, we let them in. In fact, the entry for senior citizens is free, while we charge Rs 10 from others for a visit. Incidentally, if you notice, most senior citizens who come, walk solo, or not more than two together. They always have their masks on. They don’t even talk. They walk, do their exercises and go back. So why should we be harsh to them?” said the ticket seller at the Ram Manohar Lohia Park in Gomti Nagar.Unlike the Lohia Park, the Janeshwar Mishra Park has not resumed ticketing yet. A gatekeeper there said: “We are not stopping anyone. Anyway, the footfall is drastically less than what it was before.”None of the parks has introduced any documents check, thermal scanning etc.“If you notice, you will see that only those who were die-hard park visitors are returning to parks. Parks are open areas that are not known as conducive to the spread of Covid-19. Most people walk or exercise solo and some also in groups, while maintaining a distance. It cannot be that hazardous. I am 70, and I have resumed. I am a retired IAS officer and one of the gates of the CSI Towers open into Lohia Park. I use this gate and not the main one. If you notice, even couples dating, generally, sit apart if they sit on a bench,” said a Lohia Park regular.In the morning slot, the majority of people are walkers, joggers, yoga enthusiasts, and such bands of young boys who play recreational football or cricket. But the evenings also have a sizable number of dating couples - considering most other rendezvous like restaurants, malls, multiplexes continue to be locked down. Even such couples were not spotted cuddling. Instead, on benches, they sit separately at far ends and chat.However, one instruction requests people not to sit on park benches. Most people enter and leave the parks with masks on, and some take them off while exercising.On the whole, it looks livelier in the parks than in other parts of the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/enthusiasts-line-up-as-life-returns-to-parks/story-izUFfgwVfrJXWhEx0NzRcM.html

The interview will be a direct dialogue with the candidate and non-mediated. The app will be rolled out on Google Playstore,” said Manoj Kumar Singh in the detailed guidelines for the process. For an appointment as the BC Sakhi in a gram panchayat, the candidate will have to be a resident of the same gram panchayat.A member of a self-help group (SHG) in a village who was among the first one to join it and played a vital role in the running of the SHG would be given preference. Others may also apply according to various criteria.Once appointed, the sakhis would undergo training as they will have to use technology in their work. The government aims to select candidates who would be inclined to learn new techniques, apart from having leadership quality.Once selected, a Sakhi would get Rs 4,000 per month as honorarium and one time Rs 75,000 easy installment loan for tech hardware and installation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-rolls-out-plan-for-bc-sakhis-in-gram-panchayats/story-ImGgCVxiPB6i1rX3iIxSmO.html

18-06-2020||Chandigarh||Muddy water problem persists for Chandigarh residents||Many Chandigarh residents have been receiving muddy water in their supply for over a month now. Some resident welfare associations (RWAs) have approached the authorities to get the issue resolved.Colonel Gursewak Singh (retired), president of Modern Housing Complex (MHC) in Sector 13 (Manimajra) said, “Our underground water distribution system is over 30-years-old and needs to be replaced. As per MC bylaws, authorities are asking residents to fix the supply pipes themselves. However, for the 2,000 odd houses here, the MC needs to step up or small faults and pipe bursts will continue.”Singh has written to UT adviser Manoj Parida and said that as Covid-19 cases have cropped up in Manimajra, residents need to keep their immunity up and drinking muddy water will put them at risk. Speaking on the issue, local area councillor, Jagtar Singh Jagga said, “We are using a super suction machine to refresh pipes and free them from any contamination. The work is about 70% complete and will be finished in a couple of days. Further, Manimajra will soon have new pipes installed under the 24x7 water supply scheme for which we have received Rs 162 crore under the Smart City Project. This issue will be resolved within a few months.”MC officials said the water supply from their end is fine, but pipes going from the main supply to the complex will have to be changed by residents, as per MC bylaws. Residents of other sectors are also suffering due to muddy water in their supply.Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) chairman Baljinder SIngh Bittu said, “In almost all sectors, when we open the tap, the initial supply of water is muddy. In some sectors, it improves fast, while in others, it takes time.” Bittu, a resident of Sector 21, added that many citizens in Sectors 21 and 20 were receiving muddy water as well and he had complained to MC authorities regarding this.President of the Sector 38 West RWA, Pankaj Gupta added, “Around 10 days back, only a few pockets of EWS houses near Dadu Majra village were receiving muddy water. But now, it has spread to other parts of the sector. We can see dust particles in the water whenever we have fill a bucket.”MC councillor Anil Kumar Dubey, chairman of the MC’s water supply committee said he will look into the matter. “Due to usage of tullu pumps, the water supply can get muddy. But, there is no large scale fault on the MC’s part,” Dubey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/muddy-water-problem-persists-for-chandigarh-residents/story-MWFydteX3qqsCnLqlSA5pI.html

He also took strong exception to reports of riot gear being sent out to the soldiers at the Line of Actual Control (LAC). “The Indian Army is trained to handle arms and stones or nail studded rods and lathis,” he said, adding, “If the Government of India wants fist or lathi fights with the Chinese, then it should send RSS cadres to the battleground.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amarinder-terms-galwan-attack-barbaric-demands-befitting-response-from-govt/story-1e9OZNW7gwZvlFm1X8r2tJ.html

Meanwhile, Amritsar deputy commissioner Shivdular Singh Dhillon on Thursday refused to accept memorandum from SAD-BJP delegation after noticing that they were violating social distancing norms. It was only after the delegation comprising prominent SAD and BJP leaders made course corrections that the DC relented. Akali leader Gulzar Singh Ranike said instead of giving any relief to the poor and underprivileged sections, the Congress government was denying ration to the poor under the ‘atta-dal’ scheme. BJP leader Shwait Malik said the state government should use the ₹6,000 crore available with it under the Disaster Management Fund to give relief to needy people. SAD spokesperson Dr Daljit Singh Cheema also demanded an independent probe by the CBI or the high court into the ration scam, besides separate probes into liquor and seed scams.In Bathinda, the protest was attended by SAD core committee members Sikandar Singh Maluka, Janmeja Singh Sekhon and former MLA Sarup Chand Singla and BJP district president Vinod Kumar Binta.

18-06-2020||City||Covid victim’s kin die at cremation site, probe ordered||A magisterial probe has been ordered after two relatives of a covid victim died before the latter’s cremation in Jammu on Thursday.The victim’s family alleged that amid scorching heat, the two men in their 40s, were made to shuttle in an ambulance for a suitable cremation site near Tawi riverbed for hours. Both the relatives were declared brought dead at the Government Medical College and Hospital in Jammu on Thursday evening.On Thursday, Jammu recorded maximum temperature of 40°C.A senior GMCH doctor said, “Three relatives of the deceased fell unconscious. Two of them were brought dead to the hospital. The cause of deaths will be known only after autopsy. We will also test them for Covid-19.”PLEADED FOR WATER, WERE ABUSED: NEPHEWAmit Jadoo, victim’s nephew, who was present at the cremation, said: “Our uncle died late Wednesday and this morning we got a call from the tehsildar who asked us to reach GMCH.”“At 11am, we went to the hospital but no health staff accompanied us. We were taken to Sidhra on the bank of Tawi river. As no proper cremation site was identified, they kept moving ambulance from one spot to another. After a while, they asked us to take the body to the riverbed. While wearing PPE kits, we started moving towards the riverbed --- that was at least at a distance of 500m --- with the body. Halfway there, we felt dehydrated and pleaded the cops for water. They, however, abused us. The ADC was there but did not help us,” alleged Jadoo.“Three of my relatives fainted. I took one of them to the hospital and gave him CPR on the way. He revived but the other two died. Though the ambulance driver helped us, officials were just giving us orders sitting 200m away. We were treated like untouchables,” said Jadoo.“The GMCH administration had provided 10 PPE kits for family members and four relatives to attend the cremation,” said a doctor. “It is the job of the administration to ensure quick and hassle-free cremation of Covid-19 victims. Our job is to provide ambulance, driver, health staff, and PPE kits,” he added.DC RUBBISHES CHARGESJammu district commissioner Sushma Chauhan has denied the charges that the ambulance kept moving from one place to another to look for a suitable place for cremation. “The cause of deaths can be established only after the autopsy. There was no inordinate delay in the cremation of the covid victim. The two relatives had fainted there and nobody had anticipated this situation,” she said. “I have ordered a magisterial probe to look into the circumstances of the death of the two people. The ADC is to submit his report by June 22,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/relative-dies-during-cremation-of-68-yr-old-covid-victim-in-jammu/story-1Yt9TAW0oTnJJKd17uoCQP.html

The AAP leaders led by Jagraon MLA Sarvjt Kaur Manuke submitted a memorandum to deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma seeking a waiver of power bills for three months.Manuke said, “Rather than providing relief to the public during this pandemic, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) is serving hefty power bills to the residents. Also, the government is collecting fixed charges from hotels, gyms and restaurants even when the gyms are closed and other sectors are not being run at full capacity. The government had announced a fixed charge waiver for two months but no relief has been provided till now.”Manuke said that rather than serving hefty power bills, the state government should waive off the bills for the last three months and relief should also be announced in terms of the property tax, water-sewer bills, etc.If no relief is announced by the state government in the coming days, then the AAP would intensify protests across the state, said Manuke. Social distancing goes for a tossSocial distancing went for a toss at DC office as the AAP leaders gathered there to protest. Many of them were seen without masks during the protest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-workers-stage-protest-outside-dc-office-seeking-waiver-off-power-bills/story-YaMIUgQj6MgiL1Jr9abAGL.html

18-06-2020||City||PPCB mulls biological treatment to check water contamination in Fazilka||BATHINDA Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) has decided to introduce in-situ bioremediation (biological treatment to clean up hazardous compounds) to check groundwater contamination in Fazilka. Two such projects in Kapurthala and Patiala are nearing completion.PPCB member secretary Krunesh Garg said on Thursday that a field study conducted in Fazilka by a high-level team led by board chairperson SS Marwaha found that urban local bodies have failed to make any headway in containing discharge of untreated sewage into drains.He said the level of total dissolved solids (TDS) in various villages around Fazilka district headquarters was about 3,000 mg/litre, attributing high levels to untreated sewage being flushed into the drains. As per the World Health Organisation, TDS value above 1,200 mg/litre is unacceptable.Garg said samples from various places in Fazilka were collected yesterday for further analysis.“In-situ bioremediation projects at Bhulana drain in Kapurthala and Bhadson drain in Patiala are expected to be operational by June 30. The same concept of bioremediation where naturally-occurring or deliberately-introduced microorganisms are used to consume and break down environmental pollutants will be used to improve the water quality situation in Fazilka. But work on bioremediation will be possible only after the monsoon season when drains are not swollen,” said the official.Both projects are being set up under the guidance of PPCB.Vikram Ahuja, a farm rights activist from Fazilka, had filed a petition in the NGT in July last year, stating that untreated sewage of 21 municipalities of Punjab’s Malwa belt was contaminating groundwater. The NGT had directed the urban local bodies (ULBs) to start bioremediation till sewage treatment plants are not constructed.Ahuja said 18 ULBs of the five Malwa districts of Fazilka, Ferozepur, Muktsar, Moga and Faridkot were directed by the green panel to adopt bioremediation of sewage by March 31 this year but there has been no progress. PPCB officials said the ULBs in Malwa have a deadline to commission STPs by March 31, 2021, or face fine. They said coronavirus outbreak led to delay in implementing bioremediation projects in the affected parts of south Malwa districts.“PPCB is concerned about various issues related to effluent and deteriorating groundwater quality in the region. Our team of experts is exploring options to make drain water fit for irrigation,” said Garg.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ppcb-mulls-biological-treatment-to-check-water-contamination-in-fazilka/story-DXF10sTeuldudWW2LJubeK.html

18-06-2020||City||Galwan valley faceoff: Five Tibetan NGOs hold anti-China protests in McLeod Ganj||Five Tibetan NGOs in McLeod Ganj on Thursday held a protest against China’s aggression on the Indian territory in Ladakh’s Galwan valley earlier this week.In a joint statement, the representatives of the NGOs, including Tibetan Youth Congress (TYC) and Students for a Free Tibet-India (SFT), said the Tibetan community stands with India and strongly condemns China’s aggression in Ladakh. “As we pay tribute to the courage of the Indian soldiers and offer our condolences to the bereaved families, we call on world leaders and the governments to stand with India against this illegal aggression by Chinese troops on Indian soil and work together to counter China’s expansionism,” said TYC president Gonpo Dhundup.He said for centuries, the independent Tibet and India enjoyed peace and China never had a border with India until Tibet was occupied by the so-called ‘People’s Liberation Amy’ in 1949. “It is high time for India to recognise Tibet as an independent country and an occupied nation by inviting Tibet’s legitimate representation on Indo-Tibet border agreement,” he said.SFT national director said befriending China and ignoring Tibet’s issue has been the biggest mistake of India in the past and it will be an unwise strategy for the national security in the future.“Independent Tibet is the only solution for the Indo-China conflict,” he added. The Tibetan activists stressed that China’s greed stretches far beyond Tibet, to the whole Himalayan region and the world at large as part of their aggressive expansionist policy. “Therefore, India has an incredible duty to lead the neighboring countries to challenge the illegal and aggressive invasion of China in such critical times,” they said.The activists said the international community must support Tibetans, Uyghurs, Hong Kongers, Southern Mongolians, and Taiwanese people in their fight against the Chinese Communist Party’s colonial practices and expansionism. They also called for boycotting Chinese products.Tibetan writer and activist Tenzin Tsudue said, “India has been obliged into a de-escalation agreement. China won on this psychological war as every Indian and Chinese know the damage India suffered but China withheld their numbers.” “India has to lick the wounds not knowing how to trust China anymore,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/galwan-valley-faceoff-five-tibetan-ngos-hold-anti-china-protests-in-mcleod-ganj/story-NMYJGGdUYdn6fFHHBEfP0N.html

Instead of taking the usual busy Kalyan- Shilphata stretch, the heavy vehicles will be diverted to the Taloja road- Khoni village road as per the notification by the Thane traffic police.“In order to ease the congestion and allow free flow of traffic on this stretch, we have decided to divert the heavy vehicles. Heavy vehicles will be prohibited on this stretch from 11pm onwards on Thursday,” said Surendra Shirsat, senior traffic Kalyan“Currently, the traffic movement of the Kalyan-Shilphata stretch is slow, as 25% of the vehicles are on road since lockdown 5.0. When all the vehicles will start plying, the condition on this stretch will get worse,” added Shirsat.A safety audit of the 50-year-old bridge was carried out by the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), which stated the structure of the bridge is unsafe and should be closed immediately. It was said that in view of the safety of the railway, as well as road traffic, it is suggested that the ROB be immediately shut for road traffic.Central Railway (CR) had in May decided to shut the bridge and informed the concerned officials of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) and the traffic police. On June 5, the traffic police released a notification on closing the bridge and mentioned that the traffic would be diverted to the parallel new bridge.As per the traffic police notification, the heavy vehicles coming all the way from Kalyan- Dombivli and moving towards Kalyan phata, Shilphata, Navi Mumbai, JNPT will face no entry at Katai naka and be diverted to Khoni village road to further destinations.Similarly, vehicles coming from Kalyan phata , Shilphaat ta and moving towards Kalyan, Dombivli, Ulhasnagar will face no entry at Kalyan phata and will be diverted to Taloja road- Khoni village- to further destinations.The 21-km-long Kalyan-Shilphata route, which connects Kalyan-Dombivli-Bhiwandi-Thane to Navi Mumbai, is a vital link and sees a major congestion during peak hours.The CR and MSRDC is yet to finalise the plan for repairing the closed bridge or building a new ROB.“There have been demands to repair the existing bridge and open it soon in order to ease the congestion. The authority is checking on the requirements and will soon decide on it,” said an officer of MSRDC, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heavy-vehicles-prohibited-to-ply-on-kalyan-shilphata-stretch/story-hQMiOYoXKHtUtH8wiEiQsL.html

18-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi commences Covid-19 rapid antigen tests||The Delhi government commenced Covid-19 testing through the rapid antigen methodology at 169 centres in and around containment zones of the city on Thursday.A total of 341 teams are involved in the rapid-antigen testing which makes results available within 30 minutes, an official said.  According to Union minister G Kishan Reddy, the Centre plans to conduct six lakh rapid antigen tests at these 169 facilities.An official said around 50,000 tests were expected to be conducted on Thursday.Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, “Two important things happened today. Covid-19 testing rates in Delhi have been reduced to Rs 2,400 and rapid-antigen testing has started. I hope people won’t face any problem in getting themselves tested now.” At many centres, testing began as early as 9 am. People, having mild symptoms or no symptoms at all can get themselves tested, another official said.Those who came to get themselves tested at a centre in Sunlight Colony in southeast Delhi said the entire process took only about an hour. The centre started operating at 10 am by around 5 pm as many as 125 swab samples were collected, a healthcare worker said.“After arriving here, we went to the registration desk. After waiting for about half-an-hour, we were for testing. The testing process took only five to seven minutes,” Alex Samuel, 20, said, adding, “The authorities told us the results will be sent via SMSes on Friday.” A healthcare worker at the testing centre said each testing kit costs Rs 450 and can provide results within 30 minutes as compared to RT-PCR test that takes three to four hours.The kits, called Standard Q COVID-19 Ag detection, have been developed by South Korean company S D Biosensor. The testing method involves looking for antibodies which are produced when the body is exposed to a pathogen.If a person has antibodies associated with novel coronavirus, it means the person is either Covid-19 positive or has recovered.“It is an easy and cheaper method to detect asymptomatic cases,” another healthcare worker said.According to the Indian Council of Medical Research, suspected individuals who test negative for Covid-19 by rapid-antigen test should undergo RT-PCR test to rule out the infection. While positive test results should be considered as true positive and do not need reconfirmation by RT-PCR test, it said.The Ministry of Home Affairs on Monday said that testing will be tripled by Saturday.On Wednesday, Delhi recorded 2,414 fresh coronavirus cases, the highest single-day spike here, taking the tally in the city over the 47,000-mark, while the number of deaths from the disease climbed to 1,904.Last week, the Delhi government, which is scrambling to find beds for coronavirus patients, warned that there could be 5.5 lakh cases by the end of July - something it is not prepared to deal with. Hospitals will need at least 80,000 more beds, the government cautioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-commences-covid-19-rapid-antigen-tests/story-GjlWPiES499ptRiDWhyRcK.html

The customs department was directed to process the documents and ensure that the consignment containing the feeding tubes is handed over to the petitioner’s lawyers, Crawford Bayley & Co, or their representative, within 24 hours thereafter.The petitioner, an overseas citizen of India, had moved HC, stating that in December 2016 he was diagnosed with oral cancer, and due to remedial surgical operations, his intake of food was only possible through a feeding tube.He said the feeding tubes are not available in India and are required to be imported from the US, and there is no alternative available. He added that since his stock had depleted, he had ordered four boxes of the feeding tubes labelled ‘Osmolite Nutrio N-Food for Tube Feeding Patient’ from the US through DHL Express. However, the assistant commissioner of customs at Air Cargo Complex had withheld the packets.His counsel, advocate Prashant Asher on Tuesday, moved for urgent orders contending that the petitioner had a limited stock available with him, which will last only a few days. Acting on his plea, the bench had on Tuesday issued a notice to the customs authorities in Mumbai and had asked them to explain the difficulty in releasing the consignment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-orders-mumbai-customs-to-release-feeding-tubes-imported-by-cancer-survivor-from-us/story-nJqw1FzcK10e6L7PdwtmdM.html

18-06-2020||Pune||53 newborns by Covid-19 positive mothers at Pune’s Sassoon hospital; not all free of virus||Pune Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Pune has seen Covid-19 positive mothers give birth to 55 babies.Sassoon General hospital has seen the birth of 53 such deliveries, while the PMC’s Covid-19 dedicated Chandumama Sonawane Hospital has seen two such births.Doctors at Sassoon are non-committal on the exact number of new-borns who contracted the Covid-19 infection, caused by the Sars-Cov-2 virus, though confirming that the babies who tested positive never came in physical contact with the mother after the birth.Dr Aarti Kinikar, head, paediatric ward, Sassoon General Hospital said, “We have had 53 deliveries since we started a dedicated Covid-19 maternity ward, which also includes four pairs of twins. While most of the babies did taste negative, we have also reported a few cases wherein the babies tested positive for the virus. We test the baby immediately after delivery and on the fifth day. During the delivery the woman wears an N-95 mask and everyone in the operation theatre wears a PPE kit to avoid any possible transmission. However, positive cases suggest a possible trans-placental transmission of the virus, which means that the virus was transferred from the mother’s womb to the baby before the delivery. There have been certain cases across the globe that suggest this possibility, which needs to be inspected further.” While the WHO had initially stated that the virus is not transmitted from the mothers to the babies inside the womb, in April, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) stated that there is emerging evidence that transmission of virus is possible from mother to baby before, or during birth. The first baby to be delivered from a Covid-19 positive mother at Sassoon hospital was a male child delivered on April 19. The child was born through a C-section.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/53-newborns-by-covid-19-positive-mothers-at-pune-s-sassoon-hospital-not-all-free-of-virus/story-W6X3cZLTAPC6ULclKUXWaI.html

The border villages in tribal Lahaul Spiti and Kinnaur districts in Himachal Pradesh are now tense over the last few days after the buildup of Indian and Chinese forces on the Line of Actual Control. Twenty Indian Army personnel were killed in violent clashes in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on the night of June 15-16.The Army and the Indo Tibetan Border police have restricted the movement of shepherds in the high hills even as additional Army units are being moved to the mountainous terrain along the international border, say local villagers. Armoured vehicles can be seen now at Sumdo, the junction between Lahaul-Spiti and Kinnaur.China’s People’s Liberation Army is also reportedly increasing its activities along the villages bordering HP. Units have been deployed at Shipki La village and in Tunzuk, a small town on the border . Old timers say this is the first time since the 1962 Indo-China war that they have seen such a buildup of the armies of the two nations, reveals Norbu Shoiya, former panchayat pradhan of Namgia village, located just 10 km from the Chinese border. “We are scared. It’s a war like situation . We hope it does not happen and that both countries resolve their issues. In case war breaks out we will have to vacate the villages,” he adds.People here are struggling for normalcy after the Covid-19 outbreak too. “Villagers in the border areas have already suffered because of the Covid-19 lockdown. The local business community has been dealt a hard blow. We are only praying that there should not be a war,” says Hishey Negi, president, Kinnaur Indo-China Trade Association.Namgia is also a trading point for cross-border trade with China through the Shipki La pass. The annual trade that usually commences in mid -June this year has been put on hold due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the standoff between Indian and Chinese troops.There are nearly half a dozen villages including Shalkar, Tashigang, Pooh, and Dubling located within 10 kilometers of the China border. The villagers say that they can hear Chinese helicopters across the border. “ We have heard that Chinese troops have put up more tents just below our village” says Karma Nyima, pradhan of Shipki La village . Police have also put its state unit on the alert. Local villagers have been asked to share information on the Chinese buildup.Himachal shares about 260 km of a porous border with China, of which 180 km is in Kinnaur while 80 km is in Lahaul and Spiti districts .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hp-tribal-villages-tense-after-indo-china-border-buildup/story-e5AHMDYctQq76EnVbMFyFJ.html

18-06-2020||Pune||Urban warkaris redraw wari plans due to Covid-19 pandemic, go online||Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, the historic wari (pilgrimage) tradition in Maharashtra has been dramatically curtailed this year.Annually two lakh pilgrims walk from Dehu to Pandharpur, all devotees of Tukaram and/or Dnyaneshwar.This year, 50 warkaris kicked off the pilgrimage and the paduka (footprints) of both the saints will either be flown into Pandharpur or driven by road, to meet the Ashadhi Ekadashi festival of July 1.In Pune, the urban warkari (pilgrim) tradition of two organisations has also had to alter the planned ‘urban wari’ participation.Students of the National Service Scheme (NSS) at Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) in 2019 undertook a tree-planting drive to express their support to and participation in the wari.This year, the NSS has had to move online.Under the virtual wari campaign, 40,000 students from SPPU and affiliated colleges will participate in various social activities wherever they currently are, locked down or otherwise, keeping all social distancing rules and safety measures in place. A website is being set up, where students will upload photos and videos to share their virtual wari with the general public.“This year under the virtual wari initiative we will appeal to our students who are based across the state to participate in various initiatives, which will include cleanliness drives, tree planting, and blood donation camps. All these drives will be taken by following social distancing rules and guidelines will be given to students about safety measures. For this, a portal is going to be made where students will upload their photos and videos under the initiative,” said Rajesh Pande, SPPU’s management council member. Ashadhi Ekadashi is on July 1, this is when the wari normally reaches Pandharpur. SPPU has planned its virtual wari initiative eight days before July 1. A formal inauguration will be done at SPPU next week.“This year due to the pandemic situation it was not possible to conduct the wari. It was decided to create a virtual wari in which students will give a solution dimension to the wari tradition, from where they are now,” Pande said.The preparations for this initiative have already begun and SPPU’s NSS wari committee is working on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/urban-warkaris-redraw-wari-plans-due-to-covid-19-pandemic-go-online/story-bekElxRRiP92ZzNDod69hL.html

18-06-2020||Patna||Grief blends with anger in Bihar which lost five sons of the soil in Ladakh face-off||Bihar reacted with a blend of grief, anger and the spirit to make sacrifices in national interest, as news reached that the stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh has killed 20 soldiers of the country, five of them hailing from the state.Political rivalries were set aside for the moment as Deputy Chief Minister Sushil Kumar Modi and other ministers stood beside Leader of the Opposition Tejashwi Yadav and Jan Adhikar Party founder Pappu Yadav at the airport here when the mortal remains of Havildar Sunil Kumar were brought by a special aircraft. Floral wreaths were placed on the Army man’s body by the leaders and relatives who had arrived from his ancestral home in Bihta, about 30 km away, as his bereaved parents, wife and children sobbed uncontrollably. BJP MP Ram Kripal Yadav, under whose Lok Sabha constituency Pataliputra, the home of the deceased Havildar falls, was seen driving behind the decked up vehicle in which the body was taken for the last rites. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar, who offered his condolences no sooner than the news of the killing of jawans from the state was received the previous night, could not come to the airport as he was attending Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s video conference on the Covid-19 pandemic, sources said. In Samastipur district, family members of Sepoy Aman Kumar Singh were crestfallen when they learnt that the jawan, who got married only last year, had laid down his life. Bhai Randhir, a resident of the village said, “We are all proud of the sacrifice Aman has made but his family members are, naturally, shattered. We are looking forward to the arrival of his body. His family members are hoping against hope that the news they received late last night might turn out to be false.” RJD MLA Ejya Yadav, under whose Rajnagar assembly segment the deceased jawan’s village falls, also visited the house and tried to console the grief-stricken family members. In Chakfatah village of Vaishali district, the mother of Jai Kishor Singh has been crying ever since she learnt that her younger son, who joined the Army two years ago and whose marriage was being planned, has been killed in Ladakh. His father Raj Kishor Singh, a farmer, said, “He got inspired by his elder brother Nand Kishor Singh who was the first in the family to join the Army. We have suffered an unbearable loss but we have the satisfaction that our son will be remembered as a martyr.” Similar sentiments were expressed by Nimindra Yadav of Saharsa who lost his son Kundan Kumar in the clash. Survived by wife and two sons aged eight and four years, Kundan Kumar had joined the Army in 2012. RJD leader Tejashwi Yadav also contacted Kundan’s bereaved family through video conference and assured them of all support. The bereaved father said, “We feel devastated. But mark my words, I would like both my grandsons to serve the country like their father by joining the Army.” Arrah, the district headquarters of Bhojpur which takes pride in its martial character, has been reverberating with anti-China slogans ever since Chandan Yadav’s family learnt that the young sepoy has been slain. The bereaved father Hridayanand Singh, a retired Home Guard, sought to bear the loss stoically pointing out that his two elder sons are also in the Army, posted in other parts of the country. Youngest among five siblings, Chandan was supposed to get married in May but the wedding had to be put on hold because of the lockdown. In the state capital, several students’ and citizens’ groups took out processions hailing the Army’s valour and denouncing China’s “aggression”. They raised slogans declaring that Bihar has made sacrifices in all wars the country has fought and was ready for more if the situation so demanded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/grief-blends-with-anger-in-bihar-which-lost-five-sons-of-the-soil-in-ladakh-face-off/story-LTR1IEHZdLH8rkIvVw3M8K.html

18-06-2020||Lifestyle||World Autistic Pride Day: Tough times for caregivers to provide an inclusive life amid the pandemic||For most parents, one of the hardest jobs during the Covid-19 pandemic and the subsequent lockdown has been to deal with their children and their limitless energy. But, for autistic children, the closure of schools has not only disturbed their vital routine but even posed newer challenges for their caregivers. From making them comfortable wearing a mask to instilling the habit of using sanitisers, parents and caregivers have had a herculean task to keep those with autism safe from coronavirus. On Autistic Pride Day (June 18), here’s what caregivers of people with autism have to share about the unique difficulties they have to face because of the neurodiversity of people with autism, who are unable to easily communicate, socialise or adapt to a change in the environment. “Many individuals with autism aren’t comfortable wearing a mask as their sensory needs are different,” says Shreya Jain, founder and CEO of Reservoir, a Mumbai-based platform that has been connecting families of people who are differently-abled. Shreya’s younger brother Suvrat is autistic, and stays with his parents. “To guide my brother, I used social stories, visual boards, and kept unnecessary information out of the way. The simplest way is to gamify the experience. Since Suvrat does not like wearing masks, so we asked him to wear it in small slots during his favourite activity, which includes walking in our lawn. We have also prepared a small backpack with basic essentials like a mask, ID, help cards, that he has been taught to carry whenever he goes out. Such small steps can help prepare an autistic individual for lifestyle changes post lockdown,’’ she opines. Seema, a Delhiite, is making efforts to keep her eight-and-a-half-year-old daughter engaged in activities such as drawing, so as to keep anxiety at bay. It’s also a feat for her to explain the concept of social distancing when out for a walk with her young one. “My daughter has autism and associated learning disabilities, alongside issues with speech, and therefore prefers gestures. Because of limited access during lockdown, her autism therapist couldn’t tend to her needs, and we fear it has affected her development... I have also listed my neighbour as my emergency contact in case I have to self isolate. I have also made ensured that my neighbour is informed of my daughter’s routine,” adds Seema. Sangeeta Jain, a parent to a child with neurodiverse needs, and a vice principal of SOREM, a special school in Chandigarh, says one of the primary ways of ensuring post lockdown stability is to teach the child interdependence skills. “For our students, we have organised online classes to keep them engaged, but we have also done so for the parents who are now keenly vested in the education of their children. Our aim has been to teach kids with autism, simple household chores. This has enabled parents to work from home independently without being overburdened or stressed,” says Jain, who is of the opinion that to prepare kids with special needs, “it’s imperative that different members of the family are involved in the education process so that the child is used to different modes of teaching, and does not slip out of a schedule. My son is used to waking up at 7am, so even during the lockdown, we were wake him up at 7am.’’Jain agrees that following social distancing can be difficult for families with special needs. “For regular families, forced isolation has been hard, but it also opens up a conversation on how societal exclusion is an everyday reality for people with neurodiverse needs,” she adds.

18-06-2020||Mumbai||New gecko species discovered in Western Ghats after 6-year study||A new lizard species has been identified from the Western Ghats in Karnataka after a six-year study. It is one of the largest of its species reported from India.The large-bodied dwarf gecko was discovered near Hongadahalla village, Sakleshpur, Hassan district in Karnataka, by researchers from the Thackeray Wildlife Foundation Mumbai, National Centre for Biological Sciences (NCBS), Bangalore, and the Bombay Natural History Society.The findings were published in the international taxonomic journal, Zootaxa on Wednesday.Named ‘Magnificent dwarf gecko’ (Cnemaspis magnifica), the species is endemic to rocky regions and was found on vertical rock faces around Sakleshpur. With a maximum length of 58 millimetres, the new species can be identified as having a light brown tail and limbs with numerous light patches on its slightly darker brown-coloured head. Its eyes have a black outline with a thin brick red iris.The species is distinguished from others in its genus due to its size, round pupils (other gecko species from other genus have vertical pupils), and minimal differences on its body. “When we first saw this gecko in 2014 near Sakleshpur, we thought it could be a new species to science but owing lack of comparative research material from already identified geckos of this genus, we needed to conduct more studies,” said Akshay Khandekar, lead and corresponding author, who documented the findings along with Tejas Thackeray, Saunak Pal, and Ishan Agarwal.In June 2018, the team conducted fieldwork to assess the exact locality where the species has been documented from across the Western Ghats and collected specimen for comparative studies. “When we finished our lab work which includes morphological and genetic studies, we realised that the gecko species was in fact new to science,” said Khandekar.Dwarf geckos belong to the genus Cnemaspis, and are one of the oldest Indian squamates (largest in the order of snakes and lizards), that originated around 50 million years ago from the Western Ghats. There are about 50 species reported from the Western Ghats, Mysore plateau, Eastern Ghats, Assam, and Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Experts said these discoveries were crucial from the point of view of protecting the Western Ghats. “These discoveries are an indicator that we are losing species faster without even knowing we are losing them. Rather than giving away more areas to industries and mining, it is essential to protect the Western Ghats not only for the rich biodiversity but a critical source of water,” said Romulus Whitaker, veteran herpetologist and wildlife conservationist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/new-gecko-species-discovered-from-western-ghats/story-eJWS0ktuj0PJV8NawwKEDI.html

18-06-2020||Jaipur||Disappointed over discussion on coronavirus with PM: Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Wednesday said he was disappointed as the challenges and limitations faced by the Centre and state were not discussed in the video conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the coronavirus issue. Gehlot’s remarks came after he attended the second day of the discussions held by the PM with chief ministers over the issue. “All states by now know the best practices to deal with Covid-19. Disappointed to see that in today’s VC with PM, challenges and limitations of Centre and state have not been discussed,” Gehlot tweeted. The chief minister said how the Centre will help states overcome hardships after the lockdown should have been discussed at the video conference. The Rajasthan chief minister attended the second day of the PM’s VC on Wednesday. Gehlot, in a letter to the prime minister, said the country’s economy is going through a deep crisis and most industrial and commercial units are able to produce much less than their capacity. In such a situation, the central government should focus on measures to increase demand. For this, he said, direct funds should be transferred to the needy families, which would increase their purchasing power and at the same time provide financial assistance to the industries suffering from recession for payment of wages of workers. Gehlot stated this in his suggestions sent via the letter after a video conference with Prime Minister Modi on Wednesday. He said that in order to combat the coronavirus pandemic, states have to spend extra for medical resources. The central government should provide additional support for this, he said. The chief minister said in the letter that more than 53 lakh workers are currently employed in the MGNREGA scheme in Rajasthan. The eligibility for 100 days of employment of most of these rural families will be fulfilled in the coming month. In such a situation, an additional 100 man days should be created to save them from unemployment. This will benefit 70 lakh rural families of the state. Gehlot has said that due to adverse impact on revenue receipts, the states are not able to provide financial resources for the schemes run by them. In such a situation, it is very difficult for them to arrange the state’s share amount for centrally-sponsored schemes. In such a situation, the Government of India should bear 100 per cent contribution for the financial year 2020-21 for the operation of centrally-sponsored schemes. He said additional expenditure is being incurred by the states to meet the challenge of Covid-19 so central assistance is also necessary for it. The chief minister said the outstanding GST compensation payment of about Rs 961 crore for the financial year 2019-20 should be released soon. He said the industrial and business activities remained closed due to the pandemic in April and May of this financial year. Due to this, the GST compensation payment for these two months will be around Rs 4,500 crore. The Centre should also make this amount available soon, Gehlot said. He also reiterated the demand for Rs 1 lakh crore as a one-time grant to the states to revive the economic activities of the coronavirus-affected cottage, small and large scale industries as well as service sector. He said about 1 lakh 90 thousand hectares of agricultural area in 29 districts has been affected by locusts this year. According to the latest report of the World Food and Agriculture Organization, there may be a large number of locust attacks from Iran and Africa in June and July. In view of this, the central government should make proper arrangements to protect the farmers from crop loss, the chief minister said. At the beginning of the VC, the prime minister and the chief ministers observed a two-minute silence to pay tributes to the Indian soldiers who were killed in a clash with Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on Monday night.

18-06-2020||Football||The ‘Flick’ behind Bayern Munich’s resurgence and record eighth||Few football clubs have an array of former stars as bosses and influencers as Bayern Munich. There’s Uli Hoeness, who stepped down as president last November but continues his 50-year association with the Bavarian giants as board member. Karl Heinz Rummenigge is CEO (he will be replaced by Oliver Kahn in 2022) and Franz Beckenbauer, who has been coach and president, is always a 90-minute drive away in Salzburg.At Bayern’s headquarters in Munich’s Saebener Strasse, it isn’t unusual to have Paul Breitner or Gerd Mueller holding forth on matters football. In 2011, journalists from India found that even their stationery supplier is a Bayern legend and former World Cup and European champion --- Hans-Georg Schwarzenbeck.Also known as FC Hollywood, Bayern’s current squad isn’t short on star dust. Thomas Mueller, Jerome Boateng, Manuel Neuer, Benjamin Pavard and Lucas Hernandez have won World Cups; Robert Lewandowski is the fastest foreigner to 100 Bundesliga goals --- the 2019-20 Bundesliga top-scorer (31 goals) has 319 including the goal in Tuesday’s 1-0 win away to Werder Bremen ---- and Ivan Perisic has played a World Cup final. So deep are Bayern’s resources that former coach Carlo Ancelotti once said they could win the Bundesliga with hands in their pockets. On Tuesday, when Bayern got a record eighth successive Bundesliga title and 29th overall staying unbeaten in their last 23 games (22 wins, one draw), it had a lot to with a man who wasn’t supposed to be in the forefront at all --- Hans-Dieter ‘Hansi’ Flick.Despite a league and cup double in 2018-19 under coach Niko Kovac, Bayern began the season with 66% of those polled by the German football magazine ‘Kicker’ saying an eighth wouldn’t be possible. Roster rebuilding meant Franck Ribery, Arjen Robben, Mats Hummels and Rafinha were off-loaded. Hernandez and Pavard were bought but during the pre-season tour of USA, Lewandowski asked the board “to strengthen us as a team.”Before his departure, Rafinha said many players weren’t happy with Kovac, a point later borne out by Hoeness. “The greatest pressure came from the team,” Hoeness told ‘Kicker’ last November after Bayern sacked Kovac. This was after a 1-5 loss to Eintracht Frankfurt.His stress on counter-attacks and blaming players for poor performances showed that Kovac wasn’t in sync with the locker room. If Kovac, a former Croatia captain and coach, was out of step in a team which had had Pep Guardiola, Jupp Heynckes, Louis van Gaal and Ottmar Hitzfeld as coaches, imagine what it would be like for Flick to step up from assistant-coach to caretaker manager? Flick had no experience of coaching a Bundesliga team and Bayern were seventh in the standings when he took charge.Flick wasn’t a flake as a player --- he had 104 games for Bayern as a hard-working midfielder. He was someone Eric Cantona would call a ‘water carrier’ but there must be something about their industry which makes them good coaches. Didier Deschamps, anyone?Flick, 55, hadn’t managed a top team before but was Bundestrainer Joachim Loew’s assistant from 2006 to 2014. That meant he oversaw much of Germany’s project restart which began under Juergen Klinsmann before the 2006 World Cup and had them win the 2014 edition. In his first two games in charge, Bayern beat Borussia Dortmund 4-0 and Olympiakos 2-0. Used to being caught on the break, Bayern looked defensively solid in both. Soon after, they stopped looking for a famous name to replace Kovac and Flick was given a contract till 2023.From offering an arm and a shoulder to midfielder Javi Martinez to brainstorming with players about how Bayern should play, Flick was everything Kovac was not. The players told Flick that Bayern were too defensive under Kovac. Bayern’s resurgence has a lot to do with a return to front-third pressing, defensive high line and better organisation at the back. Just as it has in restoring Mueller and Boateng to their position of eminence.Mueller has been a handful in attack, providing 20 assists --- the most in Bundesliga this term --- in 24 starts. “I see myself in a position of responsibility,” Mueller has said. Central defender Boateng had 21 starts with 91.8% successful passes from open play. One of them, a measured chip in the rain in Bremen, Lewandowski chested and volleyed to take 10-man Bayern to an invincible 76 points from 32 games.“Hansi has really done well in promoting the team’s strengths of playing attacking football and keeping a well-balanced defence at the same time,” sporting director Hasan Salihamidzic --- another former Bayern player --- was quoted as saying by the sports website ‘The Athletic’. “Hansi is hungry for success, and, so are the players. It’s a great fit.”“It is sensational the kind of football we have played in the past few months,” Flick said on Tuesday. “You could feel the passion the joy for the game and the team spirit.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/football/the-flick-behind-bayern-munich-s-resurgence-and-record-eighth/story-2Hx9jnGdX5ntpECEOq3yKJ.html

18-06-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Rahul’s morning routine||He appears every morning on this central Delhi street. And sits on the pavement, watching the passersby go by.“I’m a beggar, why to hide,” he mumbles jovially but without showing any smile.He is wearing a black kurta atop a black salwar—the only bright shades about him are coming from his scraggly white beard and orange chappals. He is perched on a brown plastic mat, spread out in front of an artificially jewellery shop whose shutters are yet to open.And what can be his name?The man at last turns his head towards his interlocutor, but his gaze is curiously directed, as if it were more interested in examining something invisible that exists out there in the infinity.He draws a deep breath, slips his left hand into the deep pocket of his kurta and languidly draws out a beedi. Showing no hurry, he lights the beedi with great gravity of manners, and starts to smoke. Looking intensely at the smouldering end of the beedi, he finally opens his mouth to speak. “Rahul, my name.”He raises both his arms and mutters resignedly, “You can see.... I don’t earn... I’m a beggar.”Next moment, his fingers start to play with the folds of his salwar as if he were a sceptical shopper feeling the fabrics of a sari, the quality of which he is not sure of. Responding to a query, he says, “I have been living alone in this city for many years.” He sleeps at night near a “shaadi ghar “ (banquet house) nearby.Soon enough, another bearded man comes over and sits beside him. They do not exchange any greeting but the friendly way they silently acknowledge each other indicates that they know each other.Rahul goes on to inform that he is from the mountain state of Himachal Pradesh “but I haven’t been home in a long time.”He was not always a beggar, he clarifies without a prompt. He used to work in a mela in a hill town, and was in charge of operating a jhoola. “One day I I fell down from the jhoola and broke my arm.”At this point, he readjusts his seating posture, straightens his back, and pulls down the kurta sleeves to show the affected shoulder, saying, “My right arm doesn’t work... that’s why I could no longer do labour.”His family left him, he says, including his wife and three children.Now a municipal sweeper appears. Rahul gets up as if on cue, and swiftly moves away, leaving behind his plastic mat and bag. As the sweeper goes away and the dust cloud settles, he returns to his spot and sits down again. He fiddles into his bag and takes out a mask, tying it about his face with as much gravity as he had shown while lighting up his beedi a few minutes ago.Soon, a nearby chai seller sends him a cup of chai, his daily free treat to the man.Rahul says that he will get up only after the artificially jewellery shop owner arrives to roll up the shutters of his store.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-rahul-s-morning-routine/story-7pbfbZXOK37RjEGT4xvKxL.html

18-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh schools not keen on hosting entrance exams||In the absence of any clear directions from the government, various private schools of Chandigarh have said no to functioning as examination centres for the entrance exams that are just weeks away.Fearing an influx of students from various states amid rising cases of coronavirus, schools have expressed their reluctance in holding the examinations.The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) will conduct the pending board exams for 29 subjects between July 1 and 15, whereas the National Testing Agency will conduct the National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (NEET) on July 26. The Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) for engineering will be conducted from July 18 to July 23, and the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET) will be held on July 5.HS Mamik, president of Independent Schools Association (ISA), Chandigarh, said, “We are skeptical about conducting exams like NEET and CTET. There should be some sort of regulation with respect to doing that, but there are no instructions by the government. Centres for NEET have already been decided, most of the schools are not in a position to refuse. But my school, Vivek High School, has said we are not ready at the moment.”St John’s High School, Sector 26, is a centre for both CTET and NEET. Principal Kavita Das said, “We are worried. There is no communication from the government regarding the standard operating procedures. Our teachers are supposed to be invigilators, but most of them fall under vulnerable categories, are elderly and/or have comorbidities. We can’t refuse but I am worried.”“Many people from Punjab, Haryana and other states will be coming to give exams. Many of them will be asymptomatic. We won’t get to know about their condition by virtue of screening alone. This puts all teachers as well as children at risk,” she added. “No communication has been received regarding the material required for conducting these tests. Right now schools are already short on money as only the tuition fees is being charged. Will the government pay for the added expenses?” she asked.The principal of a government school said, “The CBSE has asked schools to be centers for their own children, but at many of those centres will host private candidates as well. How can we ensure that there is no infection?”Officials of the CBSE couldn’t be reached for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-schools-not-keen-on-hosting-entrance-exams/story-YLhI2U1Bvh91ezuyxUQqhN.html
18-06-2020||City||GMADA extends land acquisition process for Aerotropolis till November||Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has extended the acquisition process for its seventh independent township, Aerotropolis, by November, owing to the Covi lockdown. Earlier, the acquisition was to be done by May this year.The project is spread over 5,400 acres. GMADA had already issued a notification under section 11 of the Land acquisition Act to acquire 737 acres of land. The Act pertains to preliminary notification for acquiring the land and calling objections from landowners.The township is an expansion of GMADA’s Aerocity and will comprise both residential and commercial spaces. Situated in the vicinity of Chandigarh international airport, it will come up on both sides of the Zirakpur-Banur road. In the first phase, land will be acquired in Chau Majra, Saini Majra, Patton, Manauli, Siaun and Matran of Mohali district.Sanjeev Kumar, GMADA estate officer, said, “We have extended the acquisition process till November and for the announcement of award under the Land Acquisition Act, we have sent the file to authorities concerned for approval. Once it is done, we will begin the process.”He further said the announcement of award for payment of compensation to land owners and other affected persons was practically the last step towards acquisition of land after the department of housing and urban development, Punjab, issues a notification under sections 19 and 21 (1) of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013.Another senior official of GMADA said that the development authority has to purchase the said land under land pooling policy 2013. Recently, GMADA had also increased compensation for land owners opting for its land pooling scheme for various residential projects. Instead of 121 square yards, the authority will now offer the land owners a commercial plot of 200 square yards, he said.Under the land pooling scheme, farmers are offered housing and commercial sites in lieu of their land. Under the scheme, land is taken from farmers to develop big housing and commercial projects. In lieu of the land, farmers are offered housing and commercial sites.Though GMADA is yet to calculate the compensation, as per sources, the compensation will be between ₹2.5-3 crore for those who do not opt for land pooling. While acquiring land for Aerocity in 2008, GMADA had given ₹1.5 crore per acre to farmers.ABOUT THE PROJECTSpread over 5,400 acres, the township is an expansion of Aerocity.It will be built on both sides of the Zirakpur-Banur road, in the vicinity of Chandigarh international airport.The project will comprise both residential and commercial spaces.In the first phase, 737 acre land will be acquired in Chau Majra, Saini Majra, Patton, Manauli, Siaun and Matran.The remaining land will be acquired in Badi, Kurdi, Kishanpur, Safipur and Kishanpura villages.OTHER GMADA TOWNSHIPSAerocity, Knowledge City and IT City, all in the vicinity of Chandigarh airportEco City, Edu City and Medi City in New Chandigarh, Mullanpur||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gmada-extends-land-acquisition-process-for-aerotropolis-till-november/story-8nADNMV5WwEZPTCMVEOHkM.html
18-06-2020||City||Heat stress during summer reduces milk production in livestock, say experts at Ludhiana’s GADVASU||Talking about the effect of increasing temperature on livestock, director, extension education, at Guru Angad Dev Veterinary and Animal Sciences University, Ludhiana, Dr Harish Kumar Verma, has said that high temperature lowers the milk production in animals.Dr Verma said that due to lower feed intake and added heat load on the animals during summers, the milk production decreases. “Proper shelter and housing management, water application, changes in feeding regime, preventive health management etc, are some of the techniques to minimise the effect of thermal stress. Well-ventilated sheds with proper standing and resting space must be provided to dairy animals,” said Dr Verma.Open end of the shed should be covered with thatched bamboo or jute curtains. Sheet roof may also be covered with a thatch or the top of the roof may be painted white and the under surface black. Shady trees should be planted around the sheds especially at the southern wall/boundary for further cooling.Water splashing, showering, sprinkling and fogging of water on animals inside the shed 3-4 times during the hottest part of the day (11am to 4om) reduces heat load and enhances productivity due to evaporative cooling. These methods are more effective in buffaloes as they have sparse sweat glands compared to other kinds of cattle.MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR WALLOWINGAnimals should be allowed to wallow in clean water ponds during extreme hot weather (between 11am to 4pm). Arrangements should be made at the farm itself as taking the animals to a pond in hot sun neutralises the benefits of wallowing.On large/commercial dairy farms, cooling devices such as fans, wet curtains or panels, air-coolers or air conditioners may be used. Provision of ample fresh, cooled potable drinking water (in earthen pitchers commonly used in villages) also helps in reducing the heat load. Shaded water troughs in sufficient numbers should be provided at convenient places.Heat detection should be done 2-3 times a day when the animals are stress-free and relaxing during the early or late hours of the day. Never detect heat when animals are hungry, or under any type of stress.Dr RS Grewal, professor at the department of animal nutrition, advises that concentrate mixture containing more than 18% digestible protein and 70% energy contents along with palatable, digestible and laxative fodders should be fed to the animals.Proportion of green fodder should be increased. Long fodders must be chopped before feeding. If grazing is practised, animals shouldn’t be let to graze between 10am and 5pm.SUPPLEMENT DIET WITH EXTRA NUTRIENTSSoaking of concentrate in equal amount water for 20-30 minutes will increase nutrient utilization. Dietary mineral and vitamin supplementation should be increased during summer as its excretion under the effect of heat stress is increased.Supplementing dietary sodium and potassium increases milk yield during the period of heat stress.Dr LD Singla, head of the department of veterinary parasitology, informs that proper deworming and vaccination schedules must be followed for maintaining the health of animals.Ecto-parasites, whose infestation increases during summer, should be controlled properly by using suitable acaricidal spray on animals as well as in the shed, especially in corners and crevices.Biosecurity is the key during this time and no visitor/outsider should be allowed to enter the farm premises and at the entry disinfectant should be dusted.Proper care and management techniques during the summer season will help farmers to maintain healthy animals, produce more milk and assure profit from dairy farming.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/heat-stress-during-summer-reduces-milk-production-in-livestock-say-experts-at-ludhiana-s-gadvasu/story-GyF4TO3OHdACQpTJRhX8SJ.html

Since then, his wife is being targeted.”Ashok Chawla, president of the Kitchlu Nagar A-Block Residents Welfare Association, said, “During lockdown, children of the locality decided to play badminton in the park to which Dr Suman Puri had objected.

From May 28 to June 3, the area had 696 cases and a doubling rate of 15 days. Officials attributed the rise in numbers in certain areas to various reasons, including citizens flouting social distancing norms. Prashant Sapkale, assistant municipal commissioner of K-East ward (Andheri), said, “There has been a spike in cases in the past 15 days. Although airport operations were discontinued, cargo operations were still on. I got a lot of patients from there. These gave index cases. They live in other areas, but they brought the infection to the ward.”Sandhya Nandedkar, assistant municipal commissioner of R-North ward (Dahisar), said, “More than 50% of the cases are from buildings and very few cases are from slums. Citizens are not following social distancing norms and we are trying our best to maintain it. Several of the cases are from containment zones, however, we have also increased testings in the ward.”BJP councillor from Dahisar Jagdish Oza said, “People are not following social distancing strictly. The spike in cases is because of lockdown relaxations.” Sarika Pawar, corporator from Bhandup, said, “A majority of the ward comprises slum pockets that have community toilets. The local ward office lacks in spreading awareness about social distancing among people. There is a huge crowd at vegetable markets even now.”Dharavi, meanwhile, has seen its daily cases dip to 27 this month, from 47 in May. In Worli, the average number of daily cases in May was 60, which has now come down to 35-40. Worli witnessed a decline in numbers since mid-May, while the numbers in Dharavi started plunging since June 1. The authorities have attributed the improvement in Dharavi and Worli to screening maximum people, isolating and testing people. Dharavi reported 17 cases on Wednesday, and one new death.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hotspots-see-dip-in-covid-cases-3-wards-in-mumbai-see-sharp-rise-in-a-week/story-N6BG85cxHbOWgqxwX1n7RK.html

18-06-2020||Chandigarh||SAD asks Jakhar to clarify on changes in ‘anti-farmer’ APMC Act||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Wednesday asked Punjab Pradesh Congress Committee (PPCC) chief Sunil Jakhar to do a ‘jan andolan’ against chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh who had amended the State Agriculture Produce Markets Committee (APMC) Act in 2017 to include all the provisions of the Farming Produce Trade and Commerce Ordinance-2020 which was passed by the Centre recently.Asking the PPCC chief to tell why he was trying to befool the farmers, former minister Daljit Singh Cheema asked him to explain why he was hiding the fact that the Congress government had amended the State APMC Act in August 2017 to allow creation of private yards, e-trading and direct marketing.“The Congress government is also party to passing of the farming produce ordinance. It participated in the consultative process and also gave feedback to the Centre that it had already amended the State APMC Act to enable implementation of the proposed ordinance,” he said.Cheema said Jakhar should clarify if the amendment to the State APMC Act by his government was right or wrong. “If he feels it was an anti-farmer step, he should start his jan andolan from the chief minister’s residence in Chandigarh and force the government to take it back.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-asks-jakhar-to-clarify-on-changes-in-anti-farmer-apmc-act/story-7O6poaBYeTtigH2VSzjpaM.html

The statement said the department had conducted raids on 10 firms in Mandi Gobindgarh on June 12. Three persons were arrested on that day and sent to judicial custody. It had come to light that owners of the 10 firms had issued forged sale bills to seven firms in Ludhiana, Fatehgarh Sahib and Malerkotla. Following this, owners of these seven firms availed input tax credit (ITC) worth crores.The officials said an investigation was going on and the list of other beneficiaries was also being scrutinised and tax would be recovered from every single person, who claimed ITC on bogus purchases.The All Industries and Trade Forum (AITF) has urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to tighten noose around the firms involved in bogus billing and those evading tax in connivance with the alleged corrupt officials and politicians.National president of the AITF Badish Jindal said, “Tax worth crores is evaded in the county, but the government has failed to check it as some officials and politicians are involved in the practice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bogus-billing-1-37-crore-recovered-from-seven-firms-during-raids-in-punjab/story-wvdA4hDpA1nSLapRs2mcpO.html
18-06-2020||Delhi||Covid test price capped at ₹2,400 in Delhi||In a major decision, a high-powered committee formed by union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday under the chairmanship of Niti Aayog member VK Paul has decided that the rate for the RT-PCR tests for Covid-19 in Delhi should be fixed at ₹2,400 “to provide relief to the common man”.The committee’s report, given to the union health ministry on Wednesday, has been sent to the Delhi government to implement the decision, which will bring down the rate of testing by ₹2,100, from the current ₹4,500. “The report has been sent to Delhi government for necessary action,” a ministry of home affairs (MHA) spokesperson said.In a meeting chaired by Shah on Sunday morning, which was attended by Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan, it was decided that the VK Paul-led committee will look into both—thethe rates of testing and the treatment of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients in private hospitals, who are being charged huge amounts.It has also been decided that from Thursday, Covid-19 tests will be done via new the Rapid Antigen methodology approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Delhi would receive these kits on “priority”; 169 centres have been set up across the national Capital for this purpose. The MHA spokesperson said this is in line with Shah’s directive to increase testing and deliver test results quickly in Delhi.It was decided in the Sunday meeting that testing will be increased three-fold in the national Capital.The home ministry said on Wednesday that following Shah’s intervention, Covid-19 testing has increased at least four times in Delhi. It said that on June 15 and 16 alone, 16,618 samples were collected in Delhi for testing. This number varied between 4,000 and 4,500 before the Sunday meeting (June 14). The MHA spokesperson said that reports of 6,510 tests of the 16,618 have already been received, while the rest will be received by Thursday.The decision to lower the price of RT-PCR tests in the Capital was based on the report of AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria and NITI Aayog member Dr VK Paul. The committee had submitted its report on Monday after meeting with three private laboratories and four private hospitals where Covid-19 patients are treated on Sunday.One of the representatives of a laboratory present in the meeting said, “This is unexpected. The committee had heard us out and was receptive to our suggestions. This rate is just not enough for a sample that we collect from home. There is so much ancillary cost involved and ₹2,400 just does not cover it.”The representative of another lab present at the meeting with the committee said, “The government has to look at a differential pricing like the one currently in place in Delhi. The cost for testing a sample collected by Delhi government is low, but for the ones that we collect from homes, we charge ₹4,500. If the government reduces the cost of the samples provided by it to ₹2,400, we will be able to manage somehow, now that the cost of the kits and PPE has gone down. But, if this is the cost for the samples that are collected at homes as well, we will not be able to survive for long. Plus, if the government wants us to expand our testing capacity, we need to be able to recover money for the additional machines and manpower.”The Delhi government has so far paid ₹2,200 for providing samples and kits to private labs, ₹3,500 for just the samples, and ₹4,500 for the samples that were collected by the private labs while they used their own kits.Delhi begins rapid testing in containment zones on Thursday, results in 30 minutesDelhi will ramp up testing on Thursday by using rapid testing kits to detect Covid-19 infection in the 242 containment areas of the city to quickly diagnose and contain cases in the community, according to officials from Delhi’s health department.This antigen diagnostic test, which costs ₹450 and takes 30 minutes to produce results, was approved for use in India on Monday.The RT-PCR tests take six hours to produce results in lab settings, which meant district authorities had to send samples to laboratories and wait for 24-48 hours to get the results. The government has already received 50,000 of the 6 lakh kits ordered, which will be sent to the district teams by Wednesday evening. The district teams in the city have been asked to identify testing centres within or around containment areas. So far, 169 such centres have been identified for testing. “The testing centres will be set up in community halls, dispensaries or mohalla clinics where the people from the community will be brought in for testing. We will know the report then and there,” said one district official, on condition of anonymity.Four-member teams have been formed to collect the samples. “A nasal swab has to be collected for the antigen test as well, just like the samples collected for RT-PCR test. The test is quite simple, but it cannot be done door to door because a cold-chain has to be maintained for the kits,” said another district official. The kits have to be kept between 2 and 30 degrees Celsius.The test can be interpreted between 15 and 30 minutes.The ICMR on Monday gave a go-ahead to the point-of-care test kit of a South Korean company (manufactured in Manesar) to be used in containment zones and hospitals for speedier diagnosis.In its evaluation, the ICMR said that the test has a high specificity (ability to detect tur negatives) but the sensitivity (or ability to detect true positives) is between 50.6% to 84%, depending on the viral load of the patient. So, those who test negative need to undergo a second confirmatory RT-PCR test, but those who test positive will be considered to be “true positive”.ICMR recommends the test be used in containment areas for those with influenza-like symptoms or asymptomatic people who came in contact with a positive case between 5 and 10 days of exposure. In hospital settings, the test can be used for those who have influenza-like symptoms or on asymptomatic patients undergoing chemotherapy, who are immune-compromised, have cancer, are transplant patients, or the elderly. It can also be used for patients undergoing surgeries and procedures.“At the community level, whatever test we do has to be highly sensitive, false positives are okay. The sensitivity of this test and that of RT-PCR is almost similar; the sensitivity of RT-PCR is about 67%. But, the antigen test is faster and cheaper, so we can test more people. This means that we will be able to detect more cases at an early stage and ask them to remain in isolation, thereby preventing further spread in the community,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-test-price-capped-at-2-400-in-delhi/story-Bnv0bmdSR9flLEf8RJPECI.html

Members of the delegations said micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME) are finding it difficult to manage their finances as there is no inflow. They demanded that public sector banks speed up the process of distributing loans for providing relief to the industries during this time of crisis.President, CICU, Upkar Singh Ahuja said general secretary Pankaj Sharma said,”HLL Lifecare Ltd should immediately release pending payments to PPE manufacturers as the industry is facing shortage of funds. Further, we have demanded that PPE quality standards be issued by the government. Also fresh instructions should be issued for inspection of inventories in warehouses as the sample might fail there due to humidity or other reasons.”Ahuja said that HLL Lifecare Ltd is not releasing payments to PPE kit manufacturers, even when it was stated that payment would be released in five days. The minister has assured that he will take up the matter with the Union government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chamber-of-industrial-and-commercial-undertakings-delegation-meets-union-minister-of-state-over-delay-in-payment-to-ppe-kit-manufacturers/story-bI9uzkey0OE6hl2buuJJWO.html
18-06-2020||Mumbai||Investment from Chinese firms: State to seek advice from Centre||In light of the tension between India and China, the Maharashtra government will seek advice from the Centre on the recently inked deals with Chinese manufacturing companies, state industries minister Subhash Desai said. He said the state would take the “country first” approach if the Centre decided to hold investment from Chinese companies.The state government inked 12 memoranda of understanding (MoUs) on Monday, of which three were with Chinese companies, including Great Wall Motors, that would collectively bring in investment of ₹5,020 crore to Maharashtra. The Chinese automobile company, according to officials from the industries department, is expected to invest ₹3,770 crore in Talegaon, Pune. Besides, engineering firm Hengli has also signed a pact to invest ₹1,000 crore in Pune district, while PMI Electro Mobility Solutions, a joint venture with Foton China, is expected to invest ₹250 crore in Talegaon.“If the Government of India takes any policy decision on not allowing Chinese investments, it would be applicable to us as well. Till now, there was no ban or an advisory stating that Chinese companies should not be allowed [to invest], so we went ahead [with the deals]. We will ask the Centre on how to go ahead. We will proceed as they say. The country comes first, everything else is secondary,” Desai said.The deals were inked on June 15. It has come at a time when anti-China sentiments are high in the country in light of the stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh that killed 20 Indian soldiers.However, senior industries department officials point out there would not be any official stand to not allow Chinese investment. They, however, expect a delay in the launch of the projects. “Public sentiment aside, the government functions on a policy. So far, there is no advisory (against Chinese investments) and it is unlikely that there will be one. We expect the MoUs to be honoured, only it might take some time for them to actually come in, if tensions continue,” a senior official said, requesting anonymity.“If Great Wall Motors come to the state, it would be the biggest Chinese investment in Maharashtra. The Maharashtra government has signed the MoU, but the Foreign Investment Promotion Board has to clear it for foreign investment to come in. The Central government cannot directly disallow investment due to the World Trade Organisation rules, however, it can do so indirectly through non-tariff barriers, including delaying clearances, etc,” said Ram Bhogale, former president of Chamber of Marathwada Industries and Agriculture.Santosh Mandlecha, president of Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry and Agriculture, said, “Post Covid-19, Chinese companies are not welcome for investment in many countries, including Australia, US, etc. At a time when we are talking about ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’, we can use the opportunity to build industries. Currently, India and China do a business of ₹7.5 lakh crore annually, which we cannot immediately shut and shift. We will require two years if we start today.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/investment-from-chinese-firms-state-to-seek-advice-from-centre/story-TFhACjkpYrsXGHgYc2fVPM.html
18-06-2020||City||Only 15% Covid-19 surveillance coverage so far, nodal officers ask health department to increase teams||The Uttar Pradesh government’s nodal officers to oversee Covid-19 containment measures in Ghaziabad have asked the district health department to increase the number of surveillance teams to increase sample collection.According to officials, there are 260 surveillance teams deployed to monitor around 600,000 of the district’s 4.2 million people. One official said that if the district had to target every household, they would need over 1,200 such teams. The teams comprising three members -- comprising volunteers, and two trained health workers -- go to hot spot and other areas to find patients with symptoms of the coronavirus disease or other health complications. Ghaziabad on Wednesday had a total of 718 cases.“The teams comprise of volunteers, besides auxillary nurse midwife and accredited social health activists (ASHA) workers. These teams also help in contact tracing. The nodal officers said that we need to rope in more teams for taking up more active surveillance,” said Dr NK Gupta, Ghaziabad chief medical officer.Surveillance teams, which have a major role to play in containing the spread of Covide-19, visit households and put up questionnaire to residents in order to find out if anyone suffers symptoms or affected by severe acute respiratory infection (SARI)-- when a patient presents with history of fever, cough and requires hospitalisation. In case they find people with symptoms, their samples are collected to test for the coronavirus disease.According to officials, the cases that emerged in June (378 case) was SARI and those who tested positive for Covid-19 often suffered critical illness.The 260 surveillance teams were able to find around a quarter of the total Covid-19 positive cases that have emerged so far in Ghaziabad.According to state health department officials, 18,458 areas in the state, including 5980 hot spots, are under surveillance. About 9.4 million households were surveyed.“It is required that every household is surveyed. For the purpose of catering to all households we need about 1200-1500 teams. One team is assigned to take up survey of 50 households in a day. The number of members in team has also declined as many of them have been tasked with vaccination, deliveries and other activities. We are trying to ascertain the human resource needs and will draw out more workers,” said GK Mishra, district malaria officer. “As far as sampling is concerned, we have about 300 sampling done by the health department and about 50 samples as an average per day by private laboratories. Once the surveillance teams are increased, more sampling can be taken up.”At present, total of 13879 samples have been taken up so far from across the district. The officials said that they have the capacity to hike sampling to about 700-750 per day.The UP government has sent IAS Senthil Pandian C and Dr Anil Chandra, professor of neurosurgery from King George’s Medical University, Lucknow, to look after infrastructure and healthcare arrangements in Ghaziabad.The Uttar Pradesh chief minister has identified Ghaziabad as one of the 11 sensitive districts in the state where incidence of Covid-19 cases is on rise. “The western UP districts pose a major challenge and we have sent senior IAS and health department officials to these districts for review. We are also working on a plan for Meerut, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Hapur and Bulandshahr districts on directions of the chief minister. The CM has also directed for increase in Covid beds to ensure, in accordance with the policy, that symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are admitted to Covid hospitals,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-15-covid-19-surveillance-coverage-so-far-nodal-officers-ask-health-department-to-increase-teams/story-hByzJ1B0bzLLH9PWnx2LWN.html

18-06-2020||Delhi||177k people in Delhi’s 242 containment zones screened, antigen tests from Thursday||More than 177,000 people in Delhi’s 242 containment zones were screened for Covid-like symptoms by the 11 district administrations in the Capital between Sunday and Tuesday, senior government officials said.The survey was initiated by all district magistrates (DMs) immediately after Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday directed the Delhi government to start house-to-house screening in all the containment zones to ensure proper contact tracing. The screenings will also help administrations identify more symptomatic persons in these hotspots, and avoid fresh Covid clusters emerging.  While the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Sunday gave the city’s 11 DMs a week to finish the process, Delhi government reports accessed by HT revealed that the survey is likely to be completed by Thursday.As per the reports, on Sunday, when the directions were issued, around 20,000 people were screened. On Monday, this was scaled up to cover around 75,000 more persons in containment zones and, on Tuesday, over 82,000 more people were surveyed. The aim of the survey is to cover 230,466 people living in the 247 containment zones of Delhi currently. The survey report for Wednesday was not submitted to the government till this report was filed. For the survey, DMs roped in Asha [Accredited Social Health Activist] workers, auxiliary nurse midwife, and government school teachers aged below 50, among others, an official said.As per the Delhi government, as of Wednesday, Delhi has 47,102 cases of Covid-19, including 17,457 recoveries and 1,904 deaths.The Delhi government on Wednesday evening updated the number of containment zones in the city to 247.In a first, Delhi will also start using rapid antigen detection kits in every district from Thursday, a senior government official said. The screenings will now help district authorities determine who needs an RT-PCR test, and who should get an antigen detection tests. “The rapid tests will be conducted in a mixed manner — some symptomatic patients, some mild and some asymptomatic — depending on the proximity of the person to a Covid-positive patient,” said the senior government official, choosing to stay anonymous. The 11 districts will start with 50,000 antigen tests across the city from Thursday. As many as 169 centres have been set up in and around the containment zones, for people to get themselves tested, the above quoted government official said.The scaling up of testing across the city comes after the MHA on Monday said testing would be tripled in Delhi by Saturday. Accordingly, the government directed all 11 districts to collect a minimum of 1,000 samples a day. Despite the order, on Tuesday, 8,856 samples were collected across all districts and the DMs were once again asked to ramp up testing. With the start of the rapid antigen testing from Thursday, the scale is projected to go up manifold. The Capital’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal chaired a meeting on Wednesday, where he asked the Delhi government’s advisory committee for measures to make containment strategies more effective, and to recommend more mitigation strategies. Baijal also suggested the panel come up with measures for psycho-social care of front line workers, strategies to ramp up intensive medical care expeditiously, and review projections for Delhi based on worldwide trends.To ensure all containment strategies are enforced through a single chain of command, the Delhi government also issued an order designating all DMs the administrative heads of their respective districts. This means that now everyone from deputy commissioners of police (DCPs), deputy commissioners of the civic bodies, and heads of all hospitals will have to report to the DM, irrespective of their seniority and position. Following the move, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava issued an order asking all police officers “to ensure strict lockdown within the containment zones”. “The perimeter security/access control be strictly enforced. The entry/exit be completely sealed except for essential commodities/services. There should be regular mobile patrolling. Drone surveillance and announcement be done,” the order read. Southwest DM Rahul Singh said he held a meeting with all departments under his jurisdiction on Wednesday.“It has been decided that all dispensaries in the district shall function as single point of contact for all Covid-related issues. Tests will be conducted at all dispensaries. Thursday onwards, antigen and RT-PCR tests will both be available at all dispensaries for everyone. Sample will be collected at these dispensaries, and a report will be conveyed as soon as it is received from labs,” Singh said.West DM Neha Bansal said: “In adherence to directions issued by the Union home minister, a screening drive was initiated, and that has covered all households in the containment zones. We shall start conducting rapid tests from Thursday on residents using the new antigen kits. Other than that, we have also scaled up RT-PCR tests in the district. More than 1,800 RT-PCR tests were conducted under the district’s jurisdiction on Wednesday.”Of the 247 containment zones in the city, North Delhi revenue district has the most with 36, followed by 34 in the South district. Northeast Delhi, despite being the district with the highest population density in the city, has just three containment zones, government records showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/177k-people-in-delhi-s-242-containment-zones-screened-antigen-tests-from-thursday/story-cb0KoomNTohdRJZdxbBI8H.html
18-06-2020||Delhi||Covid-free certificates after recovery in Delhi||The Delhi government has directed hospitals to issue Covid-free certificates to patients while discharging them, which experts said would help reduce the stigma around the disease and allow recovered people to go back to their normal lives with ease.Patients of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) are presently being discharged without confirmatory tests after resolution of the symptoms.The certificate must mention, “This is to certify hat I have examined …. He/She has recovered from Covid and does not pose a risk to the community. He/ She is asymptomatic at the time of discharge”, the government said. This was one of the measures recommended by union home minister Amit Shah during his visit to the city’s biggest Covid-19 treatment facility – Lok Nayak hospital.The government hopes the step would reduce stigma against those who have recovered.“Now that we are discharging patients without a Covid-19 test, the patients and others in their society were anxious about whether they could spread the infection. This certificate will give assurance to the patients that they are free from the infection,” the administrator of one of Delhi government’s Covid-19 hospitals said on condition of anonymity.The certificate would ease travel issues– railway and flight, according to another administrator.“People living in the same society and the resident welfare associations are apprehensive after a person is discharged from hospital. Now, that they no longer have a negative Covid-19 test, the certificate will help ease their situation. Apart from that, screening is being done at airports and railway stations to check people for symptoms before they travel. This certificate will ensure ease in travelling,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital.“There have been requests from people about similar certificates to join back work,” Dr Kumar said.The Covid-free certificate is along the lines of the immunity certificate, which the World Health Organisation had warned against in April-end, saying there was no evidence to show people who had recovered were protected from a second infection. Allowing immunity certificates for easing out of strict social distancing norms might fuel the continued spread of the infection, WHO had warned.The same month, Chile announced that it would start issuing “release certificates”. Similar immunity certificates had also been considered by Germany, Italy and the US.A ‘comment’ published in the Lancet in May about ethics of immunity certificates says, “Vaccination certificates incentivise individuals to obtain vaccination against a virus, which is a social good. By contrast, immunity certificates incentivise infection.”However, Dr Kumar said, “This should not be seen as an immunity certificate. It is a certificate of recovery.”Dr Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said this will certainly ease the minds of residents when someone returns home after treatment. “I have been asked for such certificates by many for returning to work. However, even if it is considered to be immunity certificate, there is no evidence from India at least to show reinfection. A sizeable population already recovered in India as well as the US must have been exposed to the infection again, but no such cases have been reported. So far, only South Korea has reported a few reinfections. The studies so far show good antibody levels even at six weeks. We have to wait to see how long the immunity lasts,” he said.Dr Kishore, however, warned people against being lax about social distancing, wearing masks and washing hands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-free-certificates-after-recovery-in-delhi/story-opOFUwxQSyWWegztKzlNrI.html
18-06-2020||Delhi||Cancel pending CBSE board exams, Manish Sisodia writes to HRD minister||Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday wrote to union Human Resources Development (HRD) minister Ramesh Pokhriyal ‘Nishank’ requesting him to cancel the plan of conducting the remaining CBSE board exams for Class 10 and 12 — slated to take place in July — owing to surge of Covid-19 in the city and instead promote all students based on their internal assessment records.Earlier on April 28, Sisodia had made a similar request with the HRD minister during a virtual meeting. However, the ministry on May 8 had announced that it will conduct the pending 29 papers of Class 10 and 12 between July 1 and July 15.In his letter addressed to Pokhriyal, Sisodia on Monday said, “I am writing to draw your attention towards my concern regarding the plan of CBSE to conduct the remaining exams of class 10 and 12 in July. I hope you would agree with me that the board exams, particularly those of class 12 are high stake exams for children. Hence, subjecting them to take this exam in such an uncertain and anxiety-prone situation would not be fair to them.”Sisodia said that it will be extremely difficult to conduct exams in Delhi due to the rising Covid-19 positive cases on a daily basis. “During the last one week, the daily number of Covid-19 positive cases has been rising and the total number of confirmed cases stands at 44, 688 (as of June 16). This is likely to rise to 5.5 lakh by July 31. In such a situation, if a candidate or someone in the family tests positive, he or she will have to skip the exam causing further distress,” he said in the letter.The education minister said that there are 242 containment zones in the capital presently and the number will rise in future. “As per the current CBSE plan, a school in these zones will not be used as an exam centre but there is no clarity on how children from these zones will come out to take their exams,” he said.Mentioning that as many as 251 government schools in Delhi are currently being used as dry ration distribution centres, 33 schools have been converted into hunger relief centres, 39 as shelter homes, 10 as migrant camps and another 10 as quarantine centres, Sisodia said, “These schools will not be in a position of conducting exams from July 1, 2020.”He said that the Delhi government is planning to use auditoriums in nearly 242 schools to set up beds for Covid-19 patients to meet the requirement of additional beds, which is estimated to shoot up to around 80,000 by the end of July.“Conducting exams in the same building where there are hundreds of Covid-19 patients will be a serious risk. In such a situation, using school buildings between July 1 and July 15 and ensuring that all eligible students take their exams may be extremely difficult.”“Therefore, I once again request you to remove any further uncertainty and declare that exams for 29 subjects proposed to be conducted in July will not be conducted at all. For the results in these subjects, the CBSE may rely upon the previous school-based internal assessments which include project work, periodic tests, term exams, etc,” he said.The maximum number of pending papers are in north-east Delhi, where exams were curtailed due to the communal riots in the last week of February. Exams for the entire country were postponed on March 19, due to the Covid-19 pandemic. While the exams for subjects of Class 12 will be held across the country, the exams for class 10 will be held only in north-east Delhi.Principals of both government and private schools backed Sisodia’s demand. AK Jha, Principal of Sarvodaya Co-ed School in Rohini, said, “It’s going to be really difficult to conduct exams amid the pandemic while maintaining social distance. It will not only be dangerous for students but also for the teachers.They will have to collect question papers from bank, distribute among students and then collect it and pack them. There will be a lot of human contact. The students should be promoted based on practicals, since it’s taken in presence of externals appointed by the CBSE.”Jyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu School, agreed. “Although schools are preparing for the exams but it will be very difficult to conduct exams amid the pandemic. The government should take the decision considering the safety and security of the students,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/cancel-pending-cbse-board-exams-manish-sisodia-writes-to-hrd-minister/story-8NrZCCuetkXV1eFjJNCx7H.html
18-06-2020||Delhi||Going the extra mile, citizens come together in time of pandemic||On June 9, South Extension resident Mohit Kumar (28) made frantic calls to arrange a bed when the condition of his 62-year-old father, who had tested positive for the coronavirus disease a few days earlier, had deteriorated.He checked for the beds in the intensive care units (ICUs) of hospitals as listed on the state government’s “Delhi Corona” mobile application that gives the availability of beds in realtime, and called private hospitals to confirm a bed. However, that was in vain.A friend told him to approach Charity Beds, a non-profit organisation.“Once I told them about my father’s condition, I didn’t have to do anything. They helped me find an ICU bed,” said Kumar, whose father is now recuperating in a south Delhi hospital.Kapil Chopra, founder of the The Postcard Hotel chain of hotels and chairman of the board of EasyDiner, started Charity Beds in 2011. At the time it helped the underprivileged get admission in private hospitals in the city reserved under the economically weaker section. For the past two weeks, Chopra and his team at Charity Beds have been posting information about the availability of beds in various hospitals along with contact details almost on an hourly basis on Twitter and Facebook. They were also helping individuals like Kumar who reached out directly. .“We decided to switch our focus to helping Covid-19 patients after there were several videos doing the rounds on social media about families struggling to get people admitted to hospitals,” said Chopra. “We realised that information was not being disseminated properly about the availability of beds in various hospitals. Due to this, people have to run from one hospital to another.”Chopra says that they are able to get accurate information as his team had reliable contacts in all hospitals. “Information dissemination is very important at this time of the crisis. We have been working with hospitals for over eight years. We know people in hospitals. We are able to get realtime information from them,” said Chopra, who recently posted information about how Charity Beds works after he got a few queries from other cities.A Delhi government official said that the government has been working with such organisations and individuals during the Covid-19 crisis. “It is good that individuals and non-profit firms are doing their bit to help in this time of crisis. All these efforts really matter. For ration distribution and management of hunger centres etc, we have got support of several such individuals and organisations,” said the official.Like Charity Beds, several organisations and individuals have come forward to help people in their time of need. Some help find a plasma donor, others provide free ambulance service, and still others arrange for blood donors.DhoondhConvalescent plasma therapy has emerged as a promising treatment for serious Covid patients. It uses a blood component called plasma -- which forms 55% of the blood and contains virus-fighting antibodies – from people who have recovered from the infection to treat other patients. It is still in the clinical trial phase and only a few hospitals are authorised to administer it under guidelines prescribed by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) . Doctors, however, have warned people from considering the treatment as a “silver bullet” against Covid-19.But it is hard to find a suitable plasma donor. Delhi-based businessman Adwitiya Mal’s 69-year-old father-in-law, a Covid-19 patient admitted to a private hospital was critical and in need of plasma.“It took us about four days to find a donor for my father-in-law. The process is unwieldy ,” said Mal. “It was then that my friend, US-based Mukul Pahwa, and I decided to launch Dhoondh.” Dhoondh is a website dedicated to connect patients with donors. Both are asked to fill in accurate details such as blood type, underlying medical conditions, when they contracted the infection, among others. The website has had over 14,000 visitors, 110 patients and 63 plasma donors listed on it.Pankhuri Dudani, a 25-year-old doctor, is one of the youngest donors registered with Dhoondh.“I came across the website through a post on my school alumni group on social media. I recovered from Covid-19 earlier this month. It’s a very good initiative that was much needed at this time,” said Dudani, who is posted at the Covid-19 screening wing of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) and is now back to work. She said that she got a call from the family of a patient in need of plasma two days ago. “I am yet to hear from them again. I will encourage people to donate plasma, which is no different from donating blood.”“I’m looking for more volunteers so that they can make follow-up calls,” said Mal.Ambulance man of IndiaHimanshu Kalia (41), better known as the “Ambulance Man of India”, along with wife (37) Twinkle have been on their toes driving patients from hospital to hospital, as well as ferrying bodies to crematoriums. They charge nothing from their clients. Kalia has been providing this service since 2002. But the pandemic has changed the nature of the service he provides. While on ordinary days he attends to five to six calls a day, now he gets up to 60, including from people who wanted to know of plasma donors and funeral services. During the 68-day lockdown that ended on May 31, he ferried 210 Covid-19 patients to hospitals, and 45 bodies to crematoriums. “I would get calls from people saying that a private ambulance was charging ₹8000-10,000 for a distance of just 6 kms. There were patients who could not find an ambulance to take their dead to crematoriums. We have been working without rest even as two of my drivers as well as my wife tested positive for Covid-19,” said Kalia. Simply BloodKiran Verma and his team at Simply Blood, a non-profit organisation which connects blood donors with recipients, have been working with blood banks to maintain their stock.Blood banks in the Capital were unable to organise large-scale blood donation camps during the lockdown when travel was restricted, and now fewer people volunteer to donate blood due to the fear of contracting the disease. Verma said that his team has been trying to inform people about the blood donation camps in their areas, and persuade registered donors to donate. “The focus is now on Covid-19. But non-Covid patients such as those with thalassemia also need adequate attention and care. These patients need blood for transfusion on a monthly basis. But due to the lockdown and people being scared to go to the hospital to donate has resulted in a problem. Though our Twitter handle, we are trying to inform people about those who are in urgent need of blood. We are also working with blood banks to ensure that more and more people come and donate blood,” said Verma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/going-the-extra-mile-citizens-come-together-in-time-of-pandemic/story-yWepXUSpKBEGxuLY2vXmQO.html
18-06-2020||Delhi||Manish Sisodia visits railway coaches turned isolation centres at Shakur Basti||As the railways gears up to deploy 500 train coaches across nine stations in Delhi as isolation centres for Covid-19 patients, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Wednesday inspected the first 50 coaches, deployed at Shakur Basti railway station. The remodelled railway coaches will function as Covid Care Centres for patients with mild or very mild symptoms of the infection. Sisodia’s visit comes a day after nearly 270 isolation coaches were deployed at the platform and washing area of Anand Vihar railway station. While train services at Shakur Basti have not been disrupted, five pairs of trains travelling to and from Anand Vihar have been asked to operate from Old Delhi Railway Station until further orders.“The soaring temperatures and the heat will make it problematic for our medical staff to operate while wearing heavy personal protective equipment. We are trying our best to improve the infrastructure and come up with a solution to this so that we can begin deploying staff and admitting patients at these isolation centres,” Sisodia said. Railway officials had on Tuesday said that they were considering using “bubble sheeting” on the roof of the coaches which could bring down temperatures “by three-four degrees.” While addressing the problem of soaring temperatures, Northern Railway general manager Rajiv Chaudhry on Wednesday said during a press conference they were considering multiple options to tackle the issue. Last week, Centre had promised around 500 such coaches to Delhi to tackle the surge in Covid-19 cases in the capital. While 317 coaches have been fitted at Anand Vihar and Shakur Basti railway stations, the remaining will be deployed by Thursday in the following manner: Sarai Rohilla (50), Safdarjung (21), Adarsh Nagar (30) Shahdara (13), Delhi Cantt (33), Patel Nagar (26) and Tughlakabad (13).Food, electricity, cleaning, charging, and water will be provided by the railways while the state government is tasked with deciding upon the hospital which will be connected to these Covid care centres. “We are in touch with Indian Railway Catering and Tourism Corporation (IRCTC) for the food since they are used to managing bulk order,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sisodia-visits-railway-coaches-turned-isolation-centres-at-shakur-basti/story-wjhXVXH8C4nwBZd6b6gnyM.html
18-06-2020||Gurugram||Two toll plaza employees attacked in tiff over Rs 5||Two employees of Kherki Daula toll plaza were injured after being attacked by a group of men allegedly during a tiff over Rs 5 on the Delhi-Gurugram expressway on Wednesday. Police said that the men had initially also refused to pay the toll, citing that they were from a nearby village. Residents of certain villages are exempted from paying toll if they produce valid documents.Two people have been rounded up while two more are at large.The injured — the toll plaza manager and a special duty officer — were rushed to a private hospital for treatment, where their condition is stated to be critical.According to the police, the incident took place around 9.15 pm when a Swift car, in which four men were seated, entered lane 14 and one of them approached the counter to pay for the toll. Police said while returning the change, a Rs 5 coin fell on the ground.Sunil Kumar, station house officer, (SHO), Kherki Daula police station, said that the toll plaza manager asked the men in the car to move along quickly as cars were starting to pile up behind him.“The man asked the toll staffers to pick up the coin and started arguing with the manager. The argument escalated and he pulled out a knife and attacked the manager. Another staffer tried to intervene, but he was also assaulted by the suspects. As they were about to escape, a police team, stationed near the toll plaza, rounded up two of the suspects. The others managed to flee,” said SHO Kumar.The two accused men, Nikhil and Rohit, both from Ballabgarh, were taken into custody. Police said preliminary probe suggests that they were inebriated and police is checking their criminal record.Police said the toll plaza manager, identified by only his first name, Sukhbir, was stabbed in the arm and waist while a special duty officer, identified as Pankaj, suffered a stab wound in his hand.RS Bhaati, Kherki Daula toll plaza manager, said, “Two of our staffers were attacked after a scuffle over paying toll. Sukhbir and Pankaj were rushed to a private hospital. Sukhbir suffered two cut wounds on his left arm and is undergoing a surgery. Pankaj has also sustained injuries. We are lodging a police case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/two-toll-plaza-employees-attacked-in-tiff-over-rs-5/story-9gmxCnX6V9sBLh9SDMzmiI.html
18-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram plans to cap Covid-19 treatment cost in private hospitals||The district health department is planning to put a ceiling on the treatment cost of Covid-19 in private hospitals. The rates are likely to be fixed in the range of ₹10,000 to ₹23,000 per Covid-19 bed for a single day, officials said, adding that it will help the district administration tackle the rapid surge in the number of Covid-19 patients. The officials said that they are considering to adopt Ahmedabad model for the purpose, while also studying various states’ models. Explaining the Ahmedabad model, a senior official in the health department privy to the matter said, “As per their model, private hospitals cannot charge more than ₹10,000 per bed for a day in a general ward. For the High Dependency Unit (HDU), which is for patients who do not need intensive care but can’t be kept in general ward as well, the per day charges are ₹14,000.” “While for the isolation and intensive care unit (ICU), the prices are capped at ₹19,000. In case, a patient requires critical care support like ventilator, the cost cannot exceed ₹23,000 per day,” said the official. The health officials also said that they are studying price models of Telangana and Maharashtra too.In Gurugram, hospitals are charging up to ₹80,000 per day for providing critical care to patients who require ventilator support for breathing, said the official quoted above. Currently, 67 Covid-19 patients in the district are on ventilator support in 35 private hospitals, the officials said. On Monday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar had constituted a committee, comprising the divisional commissioner, MCG commissioner and chief medical officer (CMO), to look into the issue. The committee is likely to submit its suggestions on capping the Covid treatment cost by Friday. V S Kundu, chief executive officer of Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority, who is also in-charge of Covid-19 preparations in the district, said, “Under the chairmanship of divisional commissioner, the recommendations have almost been finalised.” The nodal officer for hospital management in Gurugram, Vivek Kalia, who is also the estate officer at Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), said, “We are ensuring that the multi-specialty hospitals stringently follow the directions issued by the district administration. In order to ensure that patients are properly attended to and are not overcharged, regular visits of our officials have started.”According to him, nodal medical officers have been deputed hospital-wise who would be looking into any grievances related to Covid-19 treatment cost.The Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC) in May issued an order for requisition of 50% of the total number of beds in 42 hospitals. The AMC also defined the prices for a government hospital. The ventilator facility charges were around Rs 11,250 per day. For isolation and the ICU, the charges were fixed at Rs 9,000, while Rs 6,750 for HDU and Rs 4,500 for general ward . The rates per day for private beds did not include the cost of medicines, doctors visit fee, lab tests and dialysis. But the rates included two meals, breakfast, evening tea and snacks. Mukesh Kumar, commissioner, AMC, was unavailable for a comment. Earlier this week, a private hospital chain in Delhi was under the lens for charging Rs 53,000 per day in the ICU without a ventilator, and with the ventilator prices spiked to Rs 72,000 per day.The hospital on June 14 issued a statement that the charges included most treatment packages for the very critical Covid-19 patients who alone are treated at our facility. “The costs shown on that poster include not only the room rent but also visits by RMO / intensivists / senior consultants; nebulization and oxygen charges; all medicines and supplements needed for Covid treatment; all medical consumables; all routine pathology and radiology investigations such as X-ray, Ultrasound and ECG as well as diet and related charges,” read the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-plans-to-cap-covid-19-treatment-cost-in-private-hospitals/story-s55zsjw4T1AWt4XJw4xrfP.html
18-06-2020||Delhi||Minister Satyendar Jain, MLA Atishi and two other AAP leaders test Covid positive||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday tweeted that he has tested positive for the coronavirus disease (covid-19). “Today my covid test found to be positive,” said the minister, who was admitted to the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH) on Tuesday after he developed high fever and his oxygen saturation levels dropped. His first covid-19 test, conducted on Tuesday, had shown a negative result, senior government officials said. Officials in the hospital said that he is still on oxygen support.Besides Jain, AAP MLA Atishi and two other leaders of the party -- Akshay Marathe, an advisor to CM Arvind Kejriwal and Anindita Mathur, an advisor to deputy CM Manish Sisodia -- also tested positive for the viral disease on Wednesday. Party functionaries said swab samples of all three of them were collected on Tuesday after they developed mild symptoms.All three have been recommended home isolation by doctors and contact tracing have been initiated, said a health department official, adding that their offices have been sanitised too. Delhi government officials said that the health department is yet to initiate tracing contacts of Jain.According to the Union health ministry’s recently issued revised protocols on Covid-19 management, the precise interval during which an individual with Covid-19 is infectious is uncertain. “As per the current evidence, the period of infectivity starts 2 days prior to onset of symptoms and lasts up to 8 days.” as for testing, Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines say that for asympotmatic close contatcs, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test should be done on the fifth day and repeated on the 10 day in case it was negative.Experts in the field also say that before the fifth day chances of getting a false negative result are high.“Before the 5th day chances of getting a false negative in RT-PCR test is high, more so in an asymptomatic person, as the viral load is not enough. Basically, RT-PCR is a test to detect the presence of viral RNA in the body, but if the viral load is not enough then this test wouldn’t come positive,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head, microbiology department, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi. On Sunday morning, Jain had attended the meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah along with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia. “Social distancing was strictly adhered to in the meeting but whether others present in the meeting should get tested would depend on what the health officials recommend after the contact tracing exercise,” said a senior government official.On Tuesday, soon after being admitted to the hospital, Jain had said that he developed the symptoms the previous night. Till Monday, Jain also chaired several meetings and frequented healthcare centres to take stock of covid healthcare management, a senior functionary said.Kejriwal wished Atishi speedy recovery in a tweet. “Atishi ji has played an important role in the fight against corona. I hope that she will get healthy soon and again get involved in serving the people,” Kejriwal tweeted in Hindi.Last week, Kejriwal tested negative for Covid-19. His swab samples were collected after he developed mild fever and a sore throat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/minister-satyendar-jain-mla-atishi-and-two-other-aap-leaders-test-covid-positive/story-MveK3XyYip2ToSUz5IyymO.html
18-06-2020||Delhi||Court to pronounce verdict on FIR against Ganga Ram hospital on June 22||The Delhi High Court has put “in abeyance” (on hold) an FIR registered against Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on a complaint by the city government for allegedly violating Covid-19 norms and reserved its judgment for June 22.Justice C Harishankar said the interim directions are being passed only to ensure that the status quo is not disturbed and nothing happens before the court passes any order.A senior official at Ganga Ram Hospital said, “The matter is still subjudice and we will wait for the directions from the hon’ble Delhi High Court.” Govt officials refused to comment on the issue, saying the matter was subjudice.The Delhi government has filed a first information report (FIR) against the medical superintendent of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Rajendra Nagar for not following protocols for testing patients with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The FIR was filed on June 5 on the basis of a complaint by the deputy secretary of Delhi’s department of health and family welfare, Amit Kumar Pamasi.The FIR has been filed under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) that mandates a punishment of one month’s simple imprisonment and/or ₹200 fine or six months imprisonment and/ or ₹1,000 fine if the offence puts human life at risk. The section of the IPC can be invoked under the Epidemic Diseases Act that has been in force in Delhi since mid-March as the city is battling the Covid-19 pandemic.The hospital authorities had moved the high court, seeking a stay on the case. Appearing for the hospital, advocate Rohit Aggarwal told the court that they were seeking quashing of the FIR and the proceedings initiated thereafter.He contended that the FIR registered against his client is “vague” and does not show that any offence is being committed under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He said that the FIR is silent on how disobedience, as alleged by the Delhi government, is causing obstruction, annoyance or injury to any person.Advocate Rahul Mehra, standing counsel (criminal) for the Delhi government, told the court that if prima facie, an offence has been committed, the law permits them to register an FIR and investigate it. He said that the hospital had violated the norms.On June 3, the Delhi government had asked the hospital to stop testing patients for Covid. However, on June 13 it allowed the hospital to resume testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/court-to-pronounce-verdict-on-fir-against-ganga-ram-hospital-on-june-22/story-6sxgCvdXt4qKeqfScrf8CK.html
18-06-2020||Delhi||Prudent for medicos, patients to defer elective surgeries: Govt to HC||The Delhi government has informed the Delhi High Court that it would be prudent for both patients and medical professionals to defer elective surgeries to a stage where the spread of pandemic is manageable and under better control, after a plea was filed seeking testing of asymptomatic patients going for surgeries.Advocate Satyakam, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, told Justice Najmi Waziri, told the court that special measures had been undertaken and the government needed to be extra cautious of not exposing its already constrained resources for further tests for elective procedures.He submitted that nevertheless, in the last few days, the facility of testing labs/centres had been augmented and private hospitals too had been permitted to carry out Covid-19 test.The counsel for All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) said that at the moment, the capacity of the state to undertake Covid-19 tests is already stretched and therefore it would be prudent for all parties, including medical professionals, to defer elective procedures.The court was hearing a plea filed by an ENT doctor Manni Hingorani, through her counsel Aman Hingorani, contending that non-testing of the asymptomatic patients going for surgery would not only increase the risk to the patient but also expose the doctors, nurses and other hospital staff to the danger of contracting the virus.“For emergency and elective surgery, the procedure has already been duly defined in the circular issued by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India, on June 3,” the counsels for both the Delhi government and AIIMS submitted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/prudent-for-medicos-patients-to-defer-elective-surgeries-govt-to-hc/story-M5HSkY6zoU2RvR1ddgwFMP.html
18-06-2020||Delhi||Migrants stuck at screening centre after wrong info on Shramik special||Bijay Tudu, 25, changed the position of his mat at least four times within an hour on Wednesday afternoon. He was trying to stay away from the hot summer in the long and wide-open corridor of the Chhatarpur screening centre, where a group of at least 70 migrants have been stranded for a week.The group was to board a Shramik Special train that would ferry around 1,300 migrants to West Bengal’s Howrah and Malda on Thursday (June 18), but due to a miscommunication between the coordinating agencies, they landed here a week earlier, on June 11. Having vacated their rented accommodations, they said they could not go back with their belongings as they did not have any other place to stay. The migrants had decided to go back amid rumours of another lockdown.This is one of the last few Shramik Specials, being run under a special arrangement between state governments to send stranded migrants to their home states, as most workers had already left. Until June 15, of the 450,000 migrants who had applied, around 315,568 had been sent back free of cost to 16 states in 243 special trains.The 70 are part of the over 300 migrants from south district who had reached the screening centre on June 11. While they get food and other essentials, they say the heat is unbearable during the day. “We reached here at 9 am on June 11. Around 2 pm, we were told that the train was not scheduled for the day and rather for a week later. Our landlord told us that he would give the room to someone else if we vacate. Though we had rented a cooler at the room, there was no point in going back,” said Tudu, who and his two siblings used to live in Okhla. They paid Rs 250 to an auto-rickshaw that dropped them at the centre.He said his grandmother died on June 10 and he had told his family in Malda that he will reach in two days. “I had hoped to join my family during this time. We have to leave, as we could not have survived another lockdown,” said Tudu, who used to do plastering work but had not got any job even though the lockdown eased on May 31.Last week, with a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, speculation was rife that Delhi could have another lockdown. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had on Monday clarified that there were no lockdown plans for Delhi.Some of the children slept with a piece of wet cloth on their faces to tackle the heat. Yasmin Begum, 34, fanned her two children, as the ceiling fan blew warm air. She said though food and even cold drinking water was available, it has been tough for the children. “On June 10, we got a message that we should pack and be ready to reach the centre the next morning. It is only people like us who have to suffer at the end,” said Begum, who used to live on rent near Azadpur Mandi.District officials said around 300 people reached here last week after an NGO wrongly informed them. “We told them there was no train on that day. Most people left but some said they cannot go back. We gave them an option to shift them to night shelters, but they did not want to move again with the entire luggage. We arranged for their stay and meals. The train will leave on Thursday at 6 pm,” said a senior official, who did not wish to be named.According to Sunil Kumar Aledia, an activist who works for the homeless and has been coordinating with the government to send migrants home said, “I had given a list of people to the nodal officer for West Bengal and I was told that the train leaves on June 11. They should have clarified in time to save them from the suffering.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/migrants-stuck-at-screening-centre-after-wrong-info-on-shramik-special/story-0hzTAOGtTRqN5YxIgu1axL.html
18-06-2020||Chandigarh||With borders reopened, Chandigarh sees rise in cases with travel history||With around 50% of the Covid-19 cases in the last 10 days being those of people who have recent travel history or are their contacts, UT’s nod to open the city’s borders has come under scrutiny.Of the 45 cases reported since June 8, when inter-state travel had resumed, 22 patients had recently travelled or were contacts of those who had travelled, said Anil Kumar Garg, MC additional commissioner-cum-nodal officer, MC contact tracing team.“There is marked shift in the cases being reported now. While earlier most cases were coming from the containment zone of Bapu Dham Colony, now nearly half of them are of travellers, their family members and even workplace contacts. Such cases are scattered, which makes it imperative to contain infection in those areas,” said a senior UT official, who didn’t want to be named.Under central government’s Unlock-1 guidelines, people’s movement was allowed without e-pass or permits. There is no restriction on people entering Chandigarh via road. Though the administration had directed random screening at entry points, it remains limited.Questioning the move to open city borders, Dr RS Bedi, former president of Chandigarh’s Indian Medical Association and adviser, World Medical Association, said, “People from Delhi and even Mumbai are coming to Chandigarh. Firstly, there are relatively fewer cases in Chandigarh compared to these cities. Secondly, people from places like Delhi, where the health infrastructure is under severe strain, are banking on the health facilities here.”A doctor, requesting anonymity, said, “Even women were arriving from Delhi for deliveries. We cannot stop them or deny treatment. But, it is a disconcerting situation.”Stating that the administration’s hands were tied in the matter, UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said, “We cannot stop the inter-state movement of people. Central government guidelines are very clear that there should be no border restrictions. No passes are needed. We are a union territory and have to follow central guidelines.”“The administration is prepared for any eventuality. We are undertaking random screening of people entering the city by road. But, as per ICMR guidelines, we cannot test them if they have no symptoms,” he added.18 CASES IN MOHALIEven Mohali is seeing a similar pattern in cases. Since June 8, of the 61 Covid-19 cases reported in the district, 18 are travelers and 27 are their contacts. The 18 patients had returned from Delhi, Kashmir, Hyderabad, Uttar Pradesh, Faridabad, Ahmedabad and Mumbai.Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh said although all these patients had come from outside the state, they were being counted as patients of Mohali. 31 OUTSIDERS TESTED POSITIVE IN PANCHKULAPanchkula, that has the lowest number of cases in the tricity at 55, has recorded 31 outstation patients since June 8. Among the 31 cases, 15 are from Delhi-NCR, five from Gujarat and four from Mumbai. These are not included in the district tally.“We are seeing people from different states testing positive here, but most are from Delhi, Mumbai and Gujarat,” said civil surgeon Jasjeet Kaur.Considering the spike in outstation cases, local MLA and speaker of the Haryana Assembly, Gian Chand Gupta has asked the district administration to involve the resident welfare associations (RWAs) to track travellers.“Trace travellers with the help of RWAs and ensure all of them are tested. Residents should also proactively inform the authorities about visitors in their neighbourhood,” he told the district administration officials during a meeting on Wednesday.Deputy commissioner Mukesh Kumar Ahuja said, “We cannot turn down anyone approaching the flu centre for testing. We are maintaining a database of the hotspots in the country, and anyone travelling from these places to Panchkula is tracked and their testing is ensured.” (With inputs from Hillary Victor and Shailee Dogra)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/borders-reopened-chandigarh-sees-rise-in-cases-with-travel-history/story-7De2R8hP9YVimvHYCIliZN.html
18-06-2020||Pune||Reconciled figure put Pune’s total fatalities at 545||The city on Wednesday counted 76 deaths related to the Covid-19 infection, including a reconciliation of 70 fatalities, taking the city’s total to 545, according to the Maharashtra health department.While the state health department reported 545 Covid deaths in Pune, with the addition of 18 fatalities on Wednesday, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) reported 481 deaths – a discrepancy of 64 between the two data sets.“This difference in statistics is probably because some labs may have not have reported Covid-positive deaths. However, I have sought all the latest data and will reissue the figures by Thursday,” said Deepak Mhaisekar, divisional commissioner, Pune division.The Maharashtra health department’s office in its daily report on Tuesday, June 16, reported 527 deaths in Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).In addition to the difference in the Covid-19 death toll between the state health department and the PMC, there is also a difference in the number of progressive positives reported. While the state reported 11,121 progressive positive in PMC, the Pune civic body claims the number is 10,643. The state health department reconciled death figures across the state on Tuesday, and following this exercise, 1,328 deaths were added for Maharashtra.As of Wednesday, as per the state, there are 941 progressive positive cases and 33 deaths in Pune rural; 1,1121 progressive positives and 545 deaths in PMC; and 1,188 progressive positives and 32 deaths in PCMC. Rubal Aggarwal, PMC’s additional commissioner said, “We only include those who are residents within PMC limits. Last week we had deaths of those from Pune rural too, reported from Pune hospitals. We are not hiding any deaths and our reports are updated and transparent.”District collector Naval Kishore Ram said that he will have to look into the issue before commenting on it.Even though the city reported its first fatality on March 30 from a private hospital, the death is not counted among the Pune numbers since the deceased was a Thane resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/reconciled-figures-put-pune-s-total-fatalities-at-545/story-fMKiwhhXCWQrIhrJ5dJGPP.html
18-06-2020||Pune||Housing societies in Pune contain virus spread under safety cover||Many housing societies whose residents were Covid-19 patients have successfully taken preventive steps and brought down the figure of positives.Civic authorities have confirmed that the number of cases reported from residential areas is less as compared to slums. Sanjay Rawal, chairperson, Mahadev Vihar housing society located on Satara road near Rawat Brothers, said, “Our society reported two Covid-19 positive cases and one of them passed away. The residents were concerned about health issues, but with the help of the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) we fumigated the premises, open spaces and vehicles. We followed strict guidelines and no fresh case has been detected from our society since then. A register is kept that logs residents’ movement outside the premises. We have a total of 39 units.”Rawal said that as housing societies need regular supply of vegetables and groceries, government should make it mandatory for vendors handling vegetables and fruits to wear gloves and masks.Ram Khutwad, a resident of Panchwati housing society, said, “Our society has only one case and we are following all preventive measures.”Anant Wagh of Yashtara Housing Society located near Aryaneshwar said, “The four residents who were detected positive in our housing society have recovered. PMC and corporators have taken efforts to ensure residents undergo tests. I also gave my test that came negative.”Bhimale complex which is a residential scheme near Salisbury Park reported 110 positive cases. All the 110 patients living in the 500-flat society recovered.Bibvewadi regional ward officer Ganesh Sonune said, “When the first 11 positive cases were reported in Bhimale complex, we concentrated on increasing testing, besides giving immunity boosting medicines to residents. Rapid testing helped in early detection and now all the positive people are cured and at homes.”Sonune said that PMC also contained the virus spread in Meenatai Thackeray slum, a hotspot located at Maharshinagar. The slum now has no positive case as on June 17.Smart City public relations officer Sangram Jagtap said that PMC and Smart City did not maintain data of residents living in housing societies or slums. Hence, it is difficult to tell how many housing societies are affected in the city. Meanwhile, praising the preventive steps taken by housing societies, Pune police commissioner K Venkatesham tweeted: More than 105 societies have seen arrival of corona in their society since 30th May. Lessons from this society’s #successstoriespune may make a difference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/housing-societies-in-pune-contain-virus-spread-under-safety-cover/story-6CyF5QnYXKOElMFa0byjZN.html
18-06-2020||Pune||Unlock 1.0 sees 4,426 vehicle registrations at Pune RTO, car sales higher compared to two-wheeler||Even as Covid-19 situation has caused the auto sector to bleed with a decline in vehicle sale, Pune regional transport office (RTO) has witnessed higher car sales in comparison to two-wheelers.The RTO closed its operations after the lockdown was imposed in the city on March 25 and resumed vehicle registration process on May 18. From May 18 to June 8, the office has collected a revenue of Rs 10,59,72,962 as 1,684 vehicles were registered, as per the statistics shared by RTO. Interestingly, for every three two wheelers, there was one car registered, in the RTO. Previously, for every five two-wheelers, one car used to be sold and get registered, according to officials.According to data, overall 904 motorcycles were registered at RTO between May 18 to June 8. There were 58 auto rickshaws, 27 commercial vehicles and five other vehicles registered.The lockdown period saw two auspicious occasions - Gudi Padwa and Akshay Tritiya - when the vehicle registration normally witnesses surge. While this year, there was no sale on Akshay Tritiya as dealers and RTO was shut, during Gudi Padwa in March, 2019, 4,426 vehicles were registered as compared to 7,196 registered last year during this period.Total vehicles registered during 2019 Akshay Tritiya was 5,187 and the figure this year was zero, according to RTO officials.“Pune RTO closed its all operations when the lockdown was announced. From May 18, we appointed five RTO inspectors who would visit dealers’ showroom, check vehicles and complete the registration process. We took the initiative to avoid the crowd at our offices. We are working according to the instructions given by the state government and staff is called on a rotational basis,” said deputy regional transport officer Sanjeev Bhor.Several customers who had bought new vehicles during February and March were unable to get their deliveries. Vehicle dealers restarted deliveries after June 1. Girish Karpe, who had booked a car in February got delivery in May- end, said, “I had booked the car in February and all documentation, including initial payment, loan and vehicle registration was completed. I was waiting for Gudi Padwa to take the delivery before the lockdown changed my vehicle buying plan. Finally, I got my car in the last week of May.”Vaijayanati Shewade, general manager (sales) at BU Bhandari cars, said, “We have started delivering vehicles to customers who had booked before the lockdown. All precautions are been taken while handing over vehicles. We sanitise the vehicle in front of the customer from inside out.

The delivery of vehicles is also done in a simple manner.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unlock-1-0-sees-4-426-vehicle-registrations-at-pune-rto-car-sales-higher-compared-to-two-wheeler/story-OaFDZKA8o2WcQH5muBxRVO.html
18-06-2020||Pune||PMC revokes order to reopen public gardens after residents seen without masks, flouting social distancing norms||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) on Wednesday revoked its June 3 order to reopen public gardens after residents failed to follow social distancing norms and regulations prescribed by the state government to prevent the spread of the Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 infection. As part of the Unlock phase 1 plan, of the 196 public gardens in the PMC, 33 had been reopened for morning and evening walks, including Chittaranjan Vatika in Model colony and Sambhaji garden on JM road. The civic body allowed public gardens to operate from 6am to 8am and 5pm to 7pm. The PMC garden department head Ashok Ghorpade said that the public gardens will be closed, starting Wednesday (June 17). “The PMC had allowed the use of 33 gardens which were in the non-containment zones. Permission was only given for walking and jogging, but residents started raising more demands like usage of benches and the lawn. Some of them even started using the open gym equipment at the gardens. Many residents were not wearing masks and senior citizens and kids below the age of 10 were seen at the garden,” Ghorpade added.Considering all these complaints, mayor Mohol wrote a letter to the garden department as well as the municipal commissioner to close the public gardens to stop the spread of Covid infection.“The civic body noticed many high-risk age groups visiting public gardens, including senior citizens. Residents had been seen without masks and flouting social distancing norms. The number of Covid-19 cases are on the rise in the city (10,183 as of June 16) and hence, I instructed the municipal administration to rethink the decision of reopening public gardens. The gardens should not become the next source of spreading the virus,” said mayor Murlidhar Mohol.Senior citizens and children below the age of 10 have been asked to stay at home, according to state government orders as they are high-risk groups for the Covid-19 infection. Shridhar Joshi, a resident of Kothrud, said, “I use to visit public gardens regularly. It is true that some people are not following rules, but because of them why should we suffer the consequences. PMC should ensure that people without masks do not enter the garden.”Neeta Bokil, a resident of Sinhgad road, said, “A garden is the best place to take in fresh air. It is true that people are using the open gym equipment and even talk to each other in a group. It was the only time I stepped out of my home, but precaution is necessary.”Ranjan Joy from Vimannagar said, “I went for a jog everyday before the lockdown, however, I avoided going to the gardens even after they were reopened because I did not want to go to an area which is crowded. Residents do not listen to the security personnel at the gardens and even senior citizens were seen violating government norms.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pmc-revokes-order-to-reopen-public-gardens-after-residents-seen-without-masks-flouting-social-distancing-norms/story-BL5Uv1uEwKctMOgKcKFeYO.html

We are either doing some sort of indoor workouts or outdoor run-walk with Covid-19 safety measures and physical distancing. We had to abandon the cycle wari, but instead came up with this concept of a ‘fitness wari,” said Giriraj Umrikar (39), co-ordinator for the fitness wari.“Health is the key and we are encouraging people to keep their tradition intact by remotely being part of the wari, which began on June 14 and will end on Ashadi Ekadashi on July 1,” said Umrikar.To be part of the fitness wari, a participant needs to register and then undertake daily indoor/in-house/home workout activity.Yoga, climbing of stair cases and stationary cycling, all count, as long as there is no group activity, IAS clarifies.Sushil More (36), an investment analyst, said, “This year because of Covid-19, we will not able to go on the cycle wari, hence, when team IAS came up with the fitness wari, I immediately signed up for it. I am also teaching my son Kanishk how to do indoor exercise.”Kapil Patil, a 38-year-old software engineer, who is also participating in the fitness wari, said, “I will do a fitness routine to support the wari. I will be walking, running, and doing yoga.”Join the Fitness WariRegister (free) on link below. https://www.townscript.com/e/ias-fitness-wari-2020-400222||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fitness-wari-pedals-the-healthy-option-to-keep-tradition-alive/story-f3VPsiNmBF5GBEYox7uthJ.html
