A month later, the industry is currently facing a massive shortage of labour and industrialists are now doing all they can to bring the workers back.Factory owners of the city, a hub of the state’s cycle, hosiery and sewing machine industries, have been airlifting the workers from their homes, booking train tickets, arranging taxis or simply sending money to them to arrange their transport back to Ludhiana.As many as seven workers reached Ludhiana from Patna by air via Delhi last week as their employer booked air tickets for them.Bobby Jindal, owner of Balaji Processors, a blanket manufacturing firm, said, “Prior to the spread of Covid 19, the strength of workers at my firm used to be 250, on an average. Soon after the government started Shramik trains in May, I was left with fewer than 50 workers at my unit. The labour now wants to come back. I booked air tickets for seven master workers, who took a flight from Patna to Delhi and then from Delhi to the Sahnewal airport in Ludhiana only last week.”“I arranged two taxis and also booked train tickets to bring back others. I have already spent close to Rs 2 lakh on bringing back 50 workers in the last few days,” he added.Charanjit Singh Vishwakarma, former president of the United Cycle Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA), who owns cycle parts manufacturing units in the city, said he has already sent money to three of his contractors in Bihar, who employ around 30 workers each.“As trains have not fully resumed, workers are finding it difficult to get confirmed tickets to come back via trains. The government should start the trains to bring them back also,” he said.Punjab industries minister Sham Sunder Arora, who held a meeting with industrialists last week at the Circuit House here, had said that the migrant labour wants to come back and he had arranged two buses to bring back workers to Hoshiarpur on June 4.Vinod Thapar, president, Ludhiana Knitwear Club, said, “All efforts are on to bring migrant labour back. “Summer stuff has already taken a hit as market was closed. Our effort is to see that now the sale of winter stuff is not affected as this is the peak time for us,” he added.Harkirat Singh Rana, president, Hazuri Road Hosiery Association, said reservation of train tickets is a major problem being faced by workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/facing-lack-of-labour-ludhiana-industry-doing-all-it-can-to-bring-back-migrants/story-jBiczugVyPsdfDF48i4a9L.html

09-06-2020||Mumbai||HC relief for 70-yr-old widow tortured by daughter||The Bombay high court (HC) has come to the rescue of a 70-year-old widow who was being mentally and physically tortured by her daughter and threatened to evict the younger woman if she caused any further harm to her parent.“If children cannot take care of their parents and allow them to live in peace, they at least ought not to make their life a living hell,” said the bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Surendra Tavade, while issuing a stern warning to the daughter of the septuagenarian.The bench stopped short of evicting the daughter, a divorcee, and her son, from the petitioner woman’s flat at Lokhandwala Complex, because of the Covid-19 lockdown. The court, however, warned the daughter and her son that they would be evicted forthwith if either of them caused any harassment to the elderly woman or tried to stop any of her relatives from contacting her or from entering the flat.The judges said that after talking to the petitioner, they had gathered the impression that the petitioner could suffer physical and mental harassment and consequently, a threat to her life at the hands of her daughter if she continued to reside with her daughter. “However, in view of the pandemic and the consequent problems that individuals are facing, we are today not passing an order directing the daughter to make alternate arrangements,” said the bench.The elderly woman moved the HC seeking eviction of her abusive daughter and her son, as the tribunal constituted under the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 could not take up her plea for urgent reliefs due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The petitioner said that her daughter had eloped with her boyfriend, a person having a criminal background, in 1998. They spent two years in constant fights and in July 2000, he abandoned her and their toddler son. The daughter then returned to her parents’ home at Lokhandwala, as a temporary shelter for a few months. However, since then she and her son have been forcibly residing in the flat.The 70-year-old added that a few months after returning home, the daughter started harassing both, the petitioner and her husband and had threatened to level false accusations of molestation against her father.The elderly woman’s petition stated that she was mentally and physically tortured by her daughter, especially after her husband died in January 2011, and her finances were taken over by the younger woman. She alleged that she was forced to remain naked, to compel her not to step out of the house, and was served food only once a day.On August 3, 2018, the petitioner got an opportunity to step out of the flat, but was hit by an autorickshaw while crossing the road, and had to be hospitalised. Thereafter, the 70-year-old was bedridden for a long time. During this period, her daughter did not allow any of her relatives to enter the flat and also broke the woman’s mobile phone to ensure that she could not contact anyone.In February this year, the elder woman’s other daughter visited from the US and took her to Bombay Hospital, where a series of tests revealed that she had a shoulder fracture and several nerves around her neck had been badly damaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-relief-for-70-yr-old-widow-tortured-by-daughter/story-MnKHckOOH3Z29FQ9J38dZM.html

The deer had suffered severe injuries on his leg and other parts of the body as he was bitten by a dog. “A resident saw the deer in the morning and called us. We rescued the deer with the help of fire brigade officials. We admitted him to Society for Prevention of Cruelty Against Animals (SPCA), Thane, to give him immediate first aid and later took him to Sanjay Gandhi National Park,” Kadam said.Kadam said that both the deer were around a-year-old and must have got separated from the herd. Dr Shailesh Pethe, a senior veterinarian at SGNP, said, “The deer found in the morning has dog bites on his thighs, groins, abdomen and leg. His condition is critical and may not survive.

09-06-2020||Mumbai||Stab victim’s body goes missing from morgue, hospital staff booked||The Tilak Nagar police have registered a case against an unknown medical officer and morgue in-charge of Rajawadi hospital after a body of a 23-year-old victim in a murder case, went missing from the morgue of the hospital between June 4 and 7.According to the police, the deceased, Mehraj Shaikh, a resident of Govandi was stabbed by a group of people on June 3. He was admitted to Rajawadi hospital with serious injuries and died the same night. It was mandatory to perform Covid test before the post-mortem, hence his body was kept in the hospital. Deonar police, who have been investigating Shaikh’s murder, visited Rajawadi hospital to collect the body for post-mortem after Shaikh’s Covid report came positive. They found the body missing from the morgue, said a police officer.A complaint was then registered by Shaikh’s brother Siraj at Tilak Nagar police station. Police are also checking the records of all the dead bodies handed over to families or cremated between June 4 to June 7.Deputy commissioner of police Shashi Meena said, “We have registered a case under section 297 (trespassing on burial places) and 201(causing disappearance of evidence of the offence or giving false information to screen offender) of the Indian Penal Code. Further investigation is on.”“No one has been named in the FIR so far. We need to figure out the particulars of people who were in charge of the morgue, as well as who was supervising from the medical team” said Meena. This is not the first incident after an outbreak of coronavirus. In another incident, a 70-year-old man’s body went missing from KEM hospital who tested positive for Covid-19 and was on a ventilator. After an inquiry, the man’s body was later found in the hospital’s morgue. The second incident occurred last week; the Jogeshwari Trauma Hospital performed the last rite claiming to be an unclaimed body of a 41-year-old real estate agent Rakesh Verma. Verma’s family then complained that the hospital and police cremated Verma without informing the family. The police claimed that the family’s address was not found and the family claimed that entire family members were quarantined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/stab-victim-s-body-goes-missing-from-morgue-hospital-staff-booked/story-f5nWo9RKQLkpMBBWVQJq6J.html

In the wake of the coronavirus-ensued lockdown, the chief minister noted that industrial zones also have high-density population, so it becomes important to take a look at dispersal of industries in the planning stage. Thackeray also asked officials to set up trauma care centres at regular intervals of the expressway. The 701-km expressway will cover the distance between the two cities in 8 hours. It will connect 10 districts in the state and also lead to formation of 20 new townships with social infrastructure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dispersal-of-new-industries-must-cm-thackeray-on-samruddi-corridor/story-ihsetVbau0slVW0Y9OTWJK.html
09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana paddy farmers hiring buses, booking train tickets to bring farm labour from UP, Bihar||As paddy-sowing season in the state is set to start from Wednesday, farmers in Ludhiana are busy hiring buses and booking train tickets to bring farm labourers from Uttar Pradesh (UP) and Bihar.One such bus, ferrying nearly 30 farm labourers from UP, arrived in the city on Tuesday night.Confirming the development, Dr Jaspreet Kaur, senior medical officer (SMO) of the Government Meritorious School quarantine centre said, 30 migrants have arrived and all of them have been screened. “They will be kept in isolation at the sheds, located outside the village. As per the protocol, we will collect their samples for Covid-19 test,” said Dr Jaspreet Kaur.Harinder Singh Lakhowal, general secretary, Bharti Kisan Union (Lakhowal), said six such buses bringing farm labourers from UP and Bihar have been sent to Barnala.“The farm labour has started returning to Punjab. Many labourers have got in touch with the farmers and expressed their intention to return,” said Lakhowal.He said farmers are seeking permission of the district administration for bringing these workers for transplanting paddy.Jagmohan Singh, a farmer from the Sidhwan Bet area, said, “As many as 10 farmers of his village have collected nearly Rs 30,000 to bring back migrants from Rae Bareilly in UP. Travel expenses will also be shared by the labour.”BJP leader Narinder Sngh Malhi, who is also a farmer, said farmers in the Hambra area have arranged 11 private buses to bring farm labourers.“The migrant labour is expert in transplanting paddy under the conventional method. Due to a limited timeframe for transplantation, farmers depend on these labourers,” said Malhi.Anup Singh Grewal , a farmer from Hambra, who is busy booking train tickets for labourers, said, “Migrant farm labour is cheap and more efficient than the labour available in the region.”“Witnessing the exodus of migrants from Ludhiana, the local labour has also jacked up rates and demanding Rs 7,000 to 7,500 per acre for paddy transplantation, whereas migrants charge anything between Rs 4,000 to Rs 4,500 per acre,” said Grewal.Chief agricultural officer (CAO) Narinder Singh Benipal said rice transplantation is done over 255 hectares of land in the district. “The farmers can bring labourers, provided they abide by the health protocol of the government,” said Benipal.Farmer union leader BS Rajewal, who is against brining labourers from other states for transplanting paddy, said some farmers were illegally bringing labourers from the Ambala border area and not informing the health department about them.“First, we are snatching the livelihood of the local labourers during the times of pandemic and, second, we are also endangering our lives by bringing the labourers, who could be carrying symptoms of coronavirus,” said Rajewal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-paddy-farmers-hiring-buses-booking-train-tickets-to-bring-farm-labour-from-up-bihar/story-7pYEHfcqwu5QFDAJEL2xwK.html

09-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai to get India’s second megacity flood warning system on Friday||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation may get the country’s second urban flood warning system this Friday, for evaluation in Mumbai.The system was jointly conceived by scientists from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune, India Meteorological Department (IMD), and National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), Chennai; all under MoES along with BMC. It will provide early warnings for heavy rain in flood prone areas in Mumbai and enable the civic body to issue alerts for citizens who can then avoid such zones. It will also provide rainfall information, tide levels, storm surge, and issue alerts for affected low-lying areas, which should be avoided during natural disasters such as cyclones and extremely heavy rain events.The ministry of earth sciences (MoES) said the flood warning system would be made available to BMC on Friday. “This is will be the second such warning system for any city in India after Chennai and an important decision-making support system during flood incidents,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, MoES. “It will not be made public but only for evaluation, testing and utilisation by BMC this monsoon, and made available to citizens from next year.”Rajeevan added this complex system would also calculate and provide information on increase in water levels across major rivers in the city, location-wise problem areas across all 24 wards, and waterlogging at slum pockets.“Over the past two years researchers have been studying updated information of Mumbai’s drainage system, high-resolution digital elevation maps for all wards, population at each ward, observations of low-lying areas etc based on updated data provided by BMC. Combined with this, information from 160 rain gauges [instruments to measure rainfall] will provide near real time weather information,” said Rajeevan.Dr. MV Ramana Murthy, director, NCCR, said using rainfall and inundation models through flooding maps, the system will be able to provide vulnerability and risk assessment well in advance. “While the basic principle of the system is similar to that shared with the Chennai municipal corporation, the methodology used to detect specific details will be different for Mumbai since parameters are different,” he said.Scientists said the warning system was crucial considering the dense urban settlements of the city. “We have witnessed a three-fold increase in extreme weather events over parts of central India and west coast, including Mumbai, over a 66-year-period (1950-2015). Considering the population density and infrastructure at risk due to extreme weather, Mumbai has to be the first target,” said Dr. Roxy Mathew Koll, senior scientist, IITM Pune.The India Meteorological Department (IMD) will provide three- to six-hour Nowcast (immediate weather updates) as well as 72-hour early warning forecast as it has been doing. “This will be a robust system to monitor real-time weather event occurrences and timely warnings where the impact of storm surge and rising tides will also be accounted for while assessing risks,” said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD.The first early warning system for Chennai was developed by professors Subimal Ghosh and Subhankar Karmakar of Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT-B), following the 2015 floods that led to over 150 deaths. “Every monsoon there are at least three extreme weather events (with almost 200mm rain or more) in Mumbai leading to extreme difficulty for commuters. With this, citizens will have prior information on flooding hotspots, and have proper planning for public and private transportation systems. It is a complex system with multiple components. I am happy that the Chennai model will be replicated in Mumbai,” said Ghosh.Independent experts said the system’s first public test after operationalisation was likely to be in mid-June when active monsoon conditions are expected in the city. “Such early flood warning systems will be useful in Mumbai given the city’s large expanse and other factors such as population density, proximity to the sea and low elevation of areas. However, a big challenge will be in accurately issuing flood alerts (especially the flood duration) during bursts of intense rain showers that inundate the city,” said Akshay Deoras, meteorologist and PhD researcher at the department of meteorology, University of Reading. “Hourly weather forecasting in Mumbai is challenging during active monsoon conditions and weather models still have lots of limitations.”INSTALLATION OF 4 NEW DOPPLER RADARS PUSHED TO NEXT YEAROwing to delays in shipments from the United States of America (USA) due to the Covid-19 pandemic, four X-band Doppler radars will be installed in 2021. Originally, two radars were to be set up in Mumbai this year along with one each in Thane and Navi Mumbai. The radar provides long-range weather surveillance, detection and forecast for rainfall, cloud formation, thunderstorms and other weather conditions such as tropical storms with a range of up to 50-60km. “Orders were placed for the equipment, and we were informed they would be shipped by this time from USA. However, as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic, the entire acquisition process has been delayed by a year,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, MoES. While one major radar located at the Regional Meteorological Centre in Colaba can carry out weather surveillance at distance of 300 km radius from its location, a second large radar planned in Goregaon is expected within a couple of months, said Rajeevan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-to-get-india-s-second-megacity-flood-warning-system-on-friday/story-8cvek2MLrMTrzZ4kPcJ6NJ.html

The people here need immediate relief by both, the state and central government. Pawar said that he will also meet the authorities in Delhi to get all the necessary relief for the affected people at the earliest.Pawar is on a two-day tour to assess the situation in the wake of the damages caused in the region owing to Cyclone Nisarga. On Tuesday, he visited areas such as Mangaon, Mhasla, Diveagar of Raigad. He interacted with villagers to understand their issues and resolve them. He also held a meeting with local MLAs (members of legislative Assembly], members of parliament and senior officials from district administration to assess the damages and relief measures.“Farming and fishing are the two major source of livelihood for the people staying here. I found farmlands were damaged, mango and cashew orchards etc. have been destroyed, a huge number of trees, especially of coconut, have fallen, fishing boats and other equipment of the fishermen have been damaged. All this at a time when they were already sitting at home for more than two months due to the lockdown,” the NCP chief said during a press interaction.At many places, there is no power supply as electricity poles have fallen down. People are also not getting drinking water as pipelines have been damaged. Both need to be restored in the next five to seven days. People should also be provided with food grains, kerosene etc. Those who have already been distributed under Public Distribution System (PDS), should be provided with it again as the stock has been destroyed, Pawar said.“To provide immediate relief to the affected people, the process of conducting panchnama (damage assessment by the local authorities) should be completed as early as possible. I heard a team from central government is also coming to assess the damages. We will take the support of both the state and central government. We will also meet the concerned authorities in Delhi to provide relief to the affected people,” the veteran leader said.On Wednesday, the NCP chief would be visiting Ratnagiri district.On June 3, after the cyclone made landfall in Alibag; Raigad, Ratnagiri, Sindhudurg, Thane and Palghar reported severe damages. On June 5, chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray had visited Raigad. He has also announced an immediate relief package of ₹200 crore for Raigad, Ratnagiri and Sindhudurg districts. In a review meeting held on June 7, Thackeray said Thane and Palghar did not suffer as much damage as compared to the other districts and relief packages for them will be declared after assessments.On Tuesday, Shiv Sena has declared to start a helpline for the affected people.

09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Facing labour shortage, Labour shortage driving Haryana farmers to opt for subsidised crop diversification||Expecting shortage of labour for paddy transplantation, farmers in the state are showing interest in government’s incentive-based crop diversification scheme ‘Mera Pani Meri Virasat’.The scheme was launched with the aim to conserve ground water by making farmers shun the traditional water-guzzling paddy cultivation technique.As only a week is left before paddy transplantation kicks off officially, farmers are getting themselves registered for the cash subsidy of ₹7,000 provided for diversifying every acre with different crops.As per the official figures, nearly 48,500 farmers have registered themselves for crop diversification on about 1.40 lakh acres of land. They will replace paddy with maize, pulses, bajra, cotton and fruits.AGRI OFFICIALS TO CONDUCT PHYSICAL VERIFICATIONState agriculture department officials said while a huge number of registrations have been made, it can’t be stated for sure that they will actually go for crop diversifications, so verification will be conducted.“No doubt the farmers’ response is overwhelming, but it is too early to say that over 48,000 farmers have adopted the diversification. They have only registered themselves for the scheme. All the farmers will be verified physically before disbursement of the first installment of ₹2,000 per acre,” said a deputy director of the agriculture department.“The government is fully aware that the farmers may change their minds even after getting registered on the portal. This is why the incentive will be deposited into their bank accounts in two parts, and the second instalment of ₹5000 will be disbursed to them only after their crop is in the maturing stage,” said another official concerned with the project.LABOUR CRUNCH A BIG WORRYMost farmers are expecting an acute shortage of labour during the transplantation season as migrant workers will not be able to return by the end of this month.“Our nursery (paddy) will be ready for transplantation by June 15, but there is no confirmation from the labourers yet. We don’t know if they will reach by then or not,” said farmer Sunil Kumar of Gharaunda in Karnal district.“I have registered for the cash subsidy scheme and will sow other crops if I fail to transplant paddy on all 12 acres,” he added.‘READY TO PAY EXTRA FOR TRANSPLANTATION’Those who have registered for crop diversification are of the view that alternate crops are not remunerative like paddy and they were ready to pay extra to labourers for transplantation.“I have hired a worker for ₹3,000 per acre labour against the ₹2,200 paid last year. But I am happy that my crop will be transplanted on time,” said Rajesh Kumar, a farmer from Yamunanagar, adding that paddy is remunerative than the other crops as it gives assured income to farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/facing-labour-shortage-labour-shortage-driving-haryana-farmers-to-opt-for-subsidised-crop-diversification/story-mRTEYXxhkrgzNZYJmjHW7I.html
09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University students take to social media against varsity’s plan to hold exams||Students of Panjab University took to social media on Tuesday to protest against the varsity’s plan to conduct semester examinations in July by using the hashtag #PUagainstexams,.They expressed their concern as the university inches closer to conducting the examinations by issuing a new question paper pattern for final semester examinations. The social media campaign started by the students to express their discontent over the varsity’s plans which garnered more than 5,000 tweets in just a few hours on Tuesday. The students demanded that exams should not be conducted this year just like many other educational institutions and they should be promoted on the basis of other criteria.Students have raised apprehensions as many have to travel back to the campus from different places for the examinations. “The safety of students should be paramount. We are the future of the nation. We cannot be test samples. Say no to exams. Think of students coming from Kerala, West Bengal, etc,” a student tweeted.“Conducting exams in such tense times is just sheer stupidity and students are well aware of the university’s preparedness! Stop risking students’ lives for exams,” said another student on twitter.PU had suspended classes in March in the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak and many students claimed that there was no proper online teaching and their syllabus is incomplete. However, the university said it is working on the minimum movement policy for the examinations.The university also issued revised SOPs for examinations on Monday.

The order was issued after the Delhi cabinet led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday approved the roll-back of the cess.The “special corona fee” on the maximum retail price (MRP) of liquor bottles was imposed last month as the government, hit badly due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown, looked to earn additional revenue.The government recently increased the value added tax (VAT) on all categories of liquor from 20% to 25% .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-cheaper-in-delhi-from-wednesday-as-corona-cess-removed/story-NABpfINa1m4VH5TmrNXokN.html

09-06-2020||Chandigarh||One-third of wheat Punjab procured is of low quality||Procured under relaxed specifications, at least 33% of a total of 127 lakh tonne wheat lifted in Punjab this rabi season is vulnerable to faster damage as the grain is either shriveled or has lost its lustre. What is the bigger cause of worry for the state food and civil supplies department, state procurement agencies, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) as well as the storage agencies is the fact that most of this wheat, or URS grain as it is called, is stored in the open, making it even more vulnerable to the vagaries of weather.Also, 33 lakh tonne URS wheat of the last year is stored in the state godowns, taking the total low-quality stored grain to 75 lakh tonne.The movement of URS grain will be decided in a meeting scheduled on Wednesday. What can be seen as a relief for the state agencies is the fact that of the 75 lakh tonne URS wheat, 80% has less than 10% damage.But the movement of foodgrain from Punjab that picked momentum in April has now come down to half.Of the 260 lakh tonne grain stored in Punjab warehouses, 180 lakh tonne is -wheat and 80 lakh tone is rice.“Nearly 115 lakh tonne is stored in covered and plinth (CAP) area with only tarpaulin sheets overhead to protect the grain. The grain is likely to get damaged quickly,” said an officer of state food and civil supplies department.With the grain storage space in the state full to the brim, the food and civil supplies department has nearly three months to move the stock to other states as paddy will start arriving after that kharif crop harvest.“We want to move 75 lakh tonne URS grain out of our godowns on priority as it can’t be preserved for long. But the pace at which the grain is moving out is slow,” said another official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/one-third-of-wheat-punjab-procured-is-of-low-quality/story-sJFuVz7NU5ZD0k5egM9nqM.html

The cancer patient, a resident of Sector 75, was tested Covid-19 positive by a private laboratory on June 5 and admitted at a private hospital the same day. Authorities are yet to determine how he contracted the disease.Health officials said that the immediate cause of death was refractory shock with bilateral pneumonia, with cardio-respiratory failure.GB Nagar district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr. Deepak Ohri said that the case of a 68-year-old male Covid-19 patient, a resident of sector 82, who died the same day is being audited. “Death audit of the deceased is being conducted to determine the cause and circumstances leading to death. The report of his Covid-19 samples are yet to come from National Institute of Biology (NIB),” he said.The CMO said that with 38 new positive cases on Tuesday, the overall tally of cases in the district went up to 691. Apart from these figures, 54 others have been reported cross-notified to other districts and states. He said that 423 patients have been discharged from different hospitals. “The district now has 258 active cases,” he said.He said that health camps were organised in 12 sensitive places in the district on Monday, including at Mamura, Nithari, Sarfabad, Harola, sectors 8, 9 and 10. “A total of 656 patients were screened today and 14 of them, who had symptoms of fever, have been referred to the district hospital,” he said.Giving details of 54 cross-notified Covid-19 positive cases, the CMO said that while 16 of them are from Delhi, one patient each from Haryana, West Bengal and Andhra Pradesh have also been found in the GB Nagar district. “While nine patients have duplicate entries in the log, the remaining 24 are from other districts of Uttar Pradesh, including seven each from Bulandshahr and Ghaziabad, two from Hapur and one from Agra,” he said.Over concerns that Noida was not admitting patients from other states, district magistrate Suhas LY said that all private and government hospitals were asked to ensure that all coming to the emergency and other wards were treated. “If any hospital has any difficulty in treating patients, they can refer them to hospitals with better healthcare facilities. But, before referring the patients, that hospital will have to properly co-ordinate with the referred hospital so that the patients don not suffer. However, the standard protocol for Covid-19 will be followed at every step by all these hospitals,” he said.The DM also said that the director of Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, has been assigned to train about Covid-19 protocols to all the doctors of these hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/death-toll-reaches-double-digit-in-gb-nagar-total-count-nears-700-mark/story-kqY6d1ht4tVevNxqvz8idM.html

The authority has hired contractors to desilt 68 out of 75 main drains and the work is in full swing, officials said. The authority will hire contractors for other drains soon as it has fixed June 30 as deadline to desilt all big and small drains, the officials said, adding that Noida has 300-km total drain length if all small and big drains’ length is put together. “We have directed the staff to expedite the work of de-silting so that it gets completed on time. We have made sure that the workers engaged in the job use all safety gear,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of Noida authority. Maheshwari is also conducting inspections at the site to get the work done as per deadline.The authority has decided to ensure that the staff engaged in the desilting work wear masks and follow all social distancing norms to stay safe in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The authority has also directed the contractors that they should first desilt some of the biggest drains, including Harola drain, Jhundpura drain, NSEZ drain, and Sector 105 drain, among others, said the officials.Every year, the Noida authority faces a huge challenge in cleaning and desilting city’s drains before the monsoon.“We want to better the cleaning work also in view of the Covid-19 pandemic because water logging will take place if drains are not desilted properly. And water logging will further affect the cleaning condition of the city crucial to contain the spread of Covid-19,” said another Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-starts-cleaning-drains-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-LFuoq1FUXcwFBD2f03qG5L.html

However, parents alleged that Saupin’s School has merged all other charges including maintenance fee, computer fee and annual fee into the tuition fee.ABS Siddhu, director-principal of Saupin’s School said, “There is a concerted effort by a certain group of parents across the city who have decided to not pay school fees under any circumstances. While we sympathise entirely with parents who have been hit financially amid the Covid-19 lockdown, we refuse to be intimidated by these kinds of motivated complaints.”Director of school education, Rubinderjit Singh Brar said, “I am yet to go through the complaint and will examine the situation after that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/168-parents-lodge-complaint-with-fee-regulatory-body-against-chandigarh-school/story-Bi7U3u3cG4bC1plEHPaAyO.html

During the meeting, parents had raised issues regarding online classes and their increased expenses.“Schools are holding online classes at a time that is usually meant for annual summer breaks. As a result of these classes, some schools are trying to make the administration believe that their expenses are rising and we fear the schools might levy an extra charge on the parents later. We have requested the district magistrate to call for the financial statements of the schools in order to know if they have surplus funds to pay to their staff or not,” said Seema Tyagi, president, Ghaziabad parents’ association.“In fact, it is the expenses incurred by parents for their children’s education that have increased as they had to make arrangements for smartphones, laptops, and internet connection among others,” she added.The parents’ association members also requested the district officials to direct that schools to prescribe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT) books which are priced cheaper. Representatives of different schools had met the district magistrate on Monday and said their expenses are on the rise due to online classes. They also said they are also facing difficulties in paying salaries to their staff.“The district magistrate has directed that schools should mention all the problems discussed during the meeting in written communication.

09-06-2020||Noida||Noida restaurants decide to stay closed due to strict restrictions||Bearing heavy financial losses and anticipating a long recovery time for the economy, Noida’s standalone fine-dine restaurants decided to remain shut despite permission to operate under strict restrictions.High rentals, operation costs and investments, the curfew time that clashes with their peak sale hours, downsized seating capacity and a sense of fear among the customers in wake of rising numbers of Covid-19 positive cases are issues that discouraged them, restaurant owners and their associations said.On Tuesday, restaurants remained shut in the sector 18 market and other markets in Noida. Those in shopping malls too were are waiting for the right time to reopen. Some of them were hoping to renegotiate rent agreements with the landlords.According to the Noida Chapter of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), a few restaurants in the city have already decided to close down.“Operation cost includes salaries, rentals, electricity and gas, and food cost. As a restaurant owner I don’t see even partial recovery in these times. People are scared to come out, and given the current curfew timings of 9pm, we will have to start winding up from 8pm taking last order at 7pm. So there is no use,” said Varun Khera, head NRAI, Noida chapter who owns Desi Vibes restaurant in sector 18. “Three restaurants have already closed down and one is thinking of ending the business. We cannot share the names, but we at association are trying to convince them otherwise. These are tough times for this industry,” According to the restaurant owners, a restaurant in sector-18 pays a rent between ₹5 lakh to ₹6.5 lakh a month, and bears an operation cost of ₹40,000 to ₹50,000 (excluding rentals) per day, something they don’t see they can meet in the present scenario.“Every restaurant that I know of had to incur a loss of stock worth ₹2.5 to 3 lakh when they shut on March 20, five days before the nationwide lockdown. All food stock, beverages were wasted. Now to operate again, we will have to invest at least ₹3 lakh, something we don’t see returning at all. Customers are scared and even if they come, the peak hours are already compromised,” said Rishabh Proothi, owner of Garam Dharam, Noida.He said that he will wait till July to observe the market and resume operations only after his landlord comes to an understanding on the rent. “In some cities like Meerut, restaurant owners have asked the landlords to share their profits till the market stabilises instead of charging rent,” he said. “Being a franchisee based restaurant, I also have to pay royalty. Even if I start operations, I won’t be able to pay proper salaries to the staff. In my opinion, till a cure doesn’t come out, I don’t think restaurants will get back to normal. Families would want to take any risk.” A few restaurant owners even fear closing down if the business went as usual.“Main revenue comes from liquor, parties and dinner, and none of these are possible in the current scenario. So far, we had no meeting with our landlords yet. We did not pay rent for the month of April and May, and it was decided that once the business restarts we will talk about the rentals, we hope that some compromise is reached. I fear, if it continues like this for another two months, we may have to close the business,” said Ashish Sakhuja, Patiala Kitchen, sector 18.“Currently the future of restaurant business in Noida depends on landlords. If they give us some rebate, we might just kickback in coming months,” adds Desi Vibes’s Khera.According to Naresh Madan, director of restaurant chain Imperfecto that has two branches in Noida and elsewhere in Delhi and Gurugam, they expect only 10 percent return to their daily operation cost. “Right now we have lot of things to settle with the landlords. We don’t know what exactly they want from us, and we are hoping to come up for a mutually benefiting agreement, We have apprised them that the customers are not coming so let’s see. We are really hopeful of some intervention from the government in terms of rebate in taxes, the future of restaurant industry is in perils right now,” said Naresh Madan. “If we operate now, we expect not to get anything more than 10% of the operation cost, which we cannot afford. So till a vaccine doesn’t come, we may take at least 12 to 18 months to get back to pre-covid era and that’s us being optimistic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-restaurants-decide-to-stay-closed-due-to-strict-restrictions/story-3FTiTdnIOyLkNC8WVKlfcO.html

09-06-2020||City||Punjab fails to implement legislation on lifts and escalators||Despite high court directions to affix safety certificates in all the lifts installed in housing societies of Punjab, the state has neither complied with the order nor implemented the ‘Lifts and Escalators Act’ drafted by the power department.Residents living in multi-storied housing units complain that in the absence of a legislation, there is no redressal mechanism for their issues related to lifts.The provisions of such an Act ensure the smooth functioning of lifts, including installation, periodical inspections, issuing of safety certificates, deputing operators and uninterrupted power supply to run the lifts and grievance redressal.Most state governments have either adopted the Bombay Lift Act (1939) and Bombay Lift Rules (1958) or an amended form of the law as per their own needs. In 2009, even the Haryana government had enacted its own rules based on the Bombay Lift Act.In 2018, a contempt petition was filed in the Punjab and Haryana High court by the residents of Ashta Apartment Phase-2, Zirakpur, after the builder had failed to maintain its lifts. Following this, the HC had directed the Zirakpur municipal council and local government to affix safety certificates in the individual l lifts issued by the authority concerned.Ashtha Apartments resident Gulshan Rai said in the absence of a relevant legislation, residents cannot complain to any authority about the condition of lifts. In most housing societies, builders have made provisions of single lifts, which at times stop working and fail to serve their purpose. Residents are facing a lot of problems in availing this facility as the generators installed for running the lifts also go kaput at times, he rued.Punjab chief electrical inspector Arunjit Singh Sidhu revealed that the power department has submitted a draft of the ‘Lifts and Escalators Act’ to the local bodies and housing departments for their suggestions and feedback. We are hoping it will be implemented soon, he said.Chairman of Indian Institute of Architects, Punjab chapter, Sanjay Goyal, said since there are so many housing societies in the state, such an Act is the need of the hour for the safety of residents. The importance of a lift Act was felt way back in 1939 and that was when the Bombay Lift Act was promulgated, yet it is strange that Punjab has not enacted one, he said.Responding to the petition, the HC had in February 2019 observed, “It is shocking that despite the stand taken before this court that the lifts were completely repaired and functional now, the same have not been opened up for the residents on account of the order passed on September 2018, which did not bar the builder from getting the same verified and checked from the executive officer of Zirakpur municipal council.” It appears that the same has been done only to harass the residents, the court had held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-fails-to-implement-legislation-on-lifts-and-escalators/story-SpOhQT88iR8CLMEz6PEnoJ.html

Between April 1 and April 30, one out of every 45 samples tested positive on an average, while one out of every 30 samples tested positive between in the month of May when the economy had started opening up gradually.The figure worsened in June when every one positive case emerged out of nearly 10 samples between June 1 and June 9.Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad are increasing at a rapid rate.

The next 50 cases (total case count 150) were reported within 10 days, while the district crossed the 200-mark on May 21 in just another six days.The next 100 cases were reported within just 10 days with the district crossing the 300-mark on May 31. The next 100 cases emerged in a span of just six days with the district crossing 400-mark on June 6. Within a span of two days, the district breached the 500-mark on June 8. As the cases rise, testing samples remains an uphill task, said officials. “Testing samples is also a major issue as we have no government labs in Ghaziabad, and have to depend on laboratories in Noida and Meerut. Now, we have received on TruNat testing machine which can speed up the testing of samples in emergency cases and give us results within one hour. The machine which can teste 25 50 30 samples every day has been installed at MMG Hospital. The machine will primarily be used for testing in cases where suspected patients require emergency treatment,” Dr Gupta said.THREE COVID-DEATHS Three Covid-19 patients succumbed to the disease on Tuesday taking the death toll in the district to 14, with as many as 25 more people testing positive for the infection. Out of total of 527 cases, the district has 197 active cases so far.“One of the casualties include a 28-year-old man, possibly a migrant worker from Faizabad, who tested positive in Ghaziabad and died at Meerut. A 40-year-old man also died at our L3 category hospital. A 46-year-old man from Shalimar Garden is the third casualty,” said Dr NK Gupta.The 25 new cases on Tuesday include five cases from Khoda, two from Vijay Nagar and one each from Indirapuram and Crossings Republik among other localities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-cases-rise-in-ghaziabad-with-economy-opening-up-and-increased-testing-say-health-officials/story-AtyQs0X2ttiAz7tLJomHaP.html

We were waiting for the staff that can operate them and they will be functional within a week.”“Looking at the history of infected patients coming to our hospitals, I don’t think we will need to keep any patient on ventilator support as oxygen beds are enough to deal with serious cases.

The police said the sub-inspector was assaulted, handcuffed and blindfolded during the ordeal, which ended when the robbers dropped him in a field in Jhajjar and fled with his SUV. The police have registered a case under sections 394 (voluntarily causing hurt in committing robbery), 397 (robbery or dacoity with attempt to cause death or grievous hurt), 365 (kidnapping or abducting with intent secretly and wrongfully to confine person) of the Indian Penal Code(IPC) and sections 25/54/59 of the Arms Act at Pataudi police station. Several crime teams from the Gurugram Police are conducting a probe to trace the accused trio. According to the police, the incident took place around 6.15pm when Rishi Raj Singh, a resident of Kosli, Rewari, was on his way to Delhi for his duty in his SUV. The police said he had reached near Rajpura village in Pataudi when a car, in which three persons were seated, pointed towards his car tyre. In the police complaint, Singh said that he assumed that there was some tyre issue and stopped the car. “As I rolled down the windows, three armed men alighted from the other car and sat in my car. They hit me with the butt of a pistol. I was pushed to the rear seat of the car and they tied my hands behind my back. They turned the car towards Palhawas, Jhajjar and, after crossing a flyover, they blindfolded me. After about 20 minutes, they dropped in a field and fled with the car,” said Singh in the FIR. The victim said that he untied himself and a passerby informed him that he was in village Khudan in Jhajjar, following which he informed his family and the police. The accused men also stole the police official’s wallet containing ₹1,500 cash, his police identity card, PAN card, driving licence, Aadhar card, ATM card and a mobile phone. The police said the victim sustained minor bruises on his face.A police official privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “The accused men are yet to be arrested and the police are checking footage in CCTVs in the area to trace them. The victim was deputed in the security detail of a Union minister in Delhi. He was not wearing his uniform at the time of the incident and was on his way to Delhi.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sub-inspector-deputed-in-security-detail-of-union-minister-kidnapped-and-robbed-at-gunpoint/story-iTz340ybGtJ5XBX3ReaN1N.html
09-06-2020||Gurugram||GMDA, NHAI to conduct a joint study for a proposed underpass at Vatika Chowk||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) will be jointly initiating a technical study for constructing an underpass at the heavily congested Vatika Chowk, said GMDA officials on Tuesday.Vatika Chowk is one of the most congested junctions in the city, as the traffic from the major road networks in the area — such as the Southern Peripheral Road (SPR), Golf Course Extension Road, the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, Sohna Road or National Highway 248A,which connects Gurugram and Alwar — converge at the junction. During peak traffic hours, it can take commuters more than 25-40 minutes to cross the stretch.Earlier in March this year, it was decided during a review meeting of the existing traffic congestion at Vatika Chowk that an underpass needs to be constructed at the junction, said VS Kundu, chief executive officer (CEO) of GMDA. He said that last week, he had a telephonic conversation with a senior NHAI official regarding the matter, after which they both decided that a technical study would be jointly initiated by the two authorities for not only analysing the existing design flaws at the junction but to also come up with a design plan for an underpass at Vatika Chowk to addresses these issues. “We want the NHAI to construct an underpass or to make a provision for it as we anticipate traffic condition to worsen at the junction. The NHAI has probably not planned the junction properly and the same was discussed during the GMDA meeting. Both the parties agreed that proper planning needs to take place. For this, a technical committee has been constituted having both NHAI and GMDA officials to look at the best possible ways to go forward. Based on its report we will initiate the next step,” said Kundu.Kundu said that currently, the review of NHAI’s existing design of Vatika Chowk is being taken into consideration to see possible amendments that can be executed to make traffic at the junction more streamlined and easy to disperse.As per NHAI officials who are privy to the matter, they are looking to design the underpass as a bidirectional one, with each carriageway having two lanes and carrying traffic between Golf Course Extension Road and SPR, which will help commuters from both sides bypass Sohna Road entirely. They are projecting the cost of such an underpass to be around ₹60 crore. “GMDA has made a request to NHAI for taking up this underpass. I have sent the feasibility recommendation to the NHAI headquarters. A final decision is yet to be taken by the headquarters on it. We will take the next course of action based on their response,” said Ashok Sharma, project director, NHAI.As per NHAI officials, the possible construction of the underpass at Vatika Chowk is supplementary to the under-construction Sohna elevated road corridor between Sohna and Rajiv Chowk. The 21-kilometre signal-free corridor is expected to reduce travel time between Alwar and Gurugram by an hour and is expected to come up by 2022. It currently takes commuters three hours to cover the 120-kilometre stretch between the two cities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-nhai-to-conduct-a-joint-study-for-a-proposed-underpass-at-vatika-chowk/story-Jc07F1sjnWtTv0RTeVIQpN.html
09-06-2020||Gurugram||Police bust gang that honey trapped city real estate agents, 2 held||Two men were arrested from Gadoli Khurd village in Gurugram’s sector 10A on Monday for their alleged involvement in honey trapping several real estate agents in the city and Delhi, the police said.With the arrests, police said they discovered a gang with at least two other members who they have identified, including a woman, who allegedly targeted businessmen and extorted lakhs of rupees by threatening to implicate them in false cases of sexual assault. The other members of the gang are yet to be arrested, said police.Police identified the suspects by their names as 30-year-old Manjeet alias Gulli and 29-year-old Robin. They were arrested earlier too for similar cases and were out on bail.The suspects had details of more than 10 real estate agents, said police. They allegedly visited their target’s offices often and offered to help them in their business during the countrywide lockdown that was enforced from March 25 to contain Covid-19. They allegedly took the woman, a friend of Manjeet’s, along.The woman allegedly caught their target on video, which would be used to allegedly blackmail them.Police said Manjeet was the kingpin of the gang and had been in operation for the last three months.Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police (Crime), said the gang had extorted more than ₹10 lakh from several men. The most recent victim was a 32-year-old real estate agent from whom they extorted nearly ₹20,000. “We received a complaint from a man who works out of his own office in his village. He showed the WhatsApp messages to us following which we formed a team headed by the inspector of crime investigation unit 53 that laid a trap. Within a day, enough evidence was collected and the two men were caught red-handed while making calls from their residence and were arrested,” Sangwan said.According to the police, Manjeet told the woman to gain their victim’s trust and invite them to her rented apartment for drinks in Sector 10A. Once there, she would make videos of them with her to later blackmail them.“The gang would allegedly threaten the men that they would file cases of sexual assault against them if they did not pay them the money. Out of fear that their identities would be exposed, no one would approach the police,” said Sangwan, adding that raids were on to arrest the others in the gang.A case under sections 384 (extortion) , 387 (putting a person in fear of death or of grievous hurt, in order to commit extortion), 506 (criminal intimidation ), and 120B (conspiracy) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Sector 10 A police station on Monday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/police-bust-gang-that-honey-trapped-city-real-estate-agents-2-held/story-KuwmL4ZjUctHIof94HOiBM.html

It is a welcome move,” he said in his first reaction to the chief minister’s statement.Amarinder, who earlier called the 2017 battle his last election, had at a press conference via video-conferencing on Friday expressed his wish to contest the next assembly elections due in March 2022. The CM said he decided to continue in electoral politics on the persuasion of his party colleagues.‘PURSUE CONG AGENDA, NOT PERSONAL’On Congress leader Partap Singh Bajwa’s advice to Amarinder to step down and make way for others, Jakhar said that as a party MP, Bajwa should behave responsibly. “If he is talking about brotherly advice, I think brothers should talk among themselves rather than going public. These kind of public utterances demoralise the party,” he said. The Punjab Congress chief said his advice to the party leaders in general will be to work for the agenda of the Congress and not pursue personal agenda. Bajwa has been increasingly critical of the state government, particularly the chief minister, in recent months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-president-to-decide-who-will-lead-the-party-in-2022-polls-jakhar/story-mccW6vBRZCs9C44g5zgt8O.html

At a press conference here, Talwandi Sabo legislator Baljinder Kaur charged the Akali leadership with using religion for their political gains and said the SAD should be derecognised as a political party. “Longowal was handpicked on Monday for the top decision-making body of the SAD. He must quit as the head of a religious body after taking a political plunge. The Election Commission of India should also take note that a sitting chief of a religious body has been nominated for a political post,” said Kaur, also a national executive member of AAP.AAP legislator from Bathinda rural segment Rupinder Kaur Ruby said the Badal family has been controlling the SGPC, which is evident from the induction of Longowal into SAD. She said the Badal family should clarify its stand on the statement of Akal Takht acting jathedar Giani Harpreet Singh on the formation of Khalistan. “The statement appears to be carefully issued at the behest of the Badal clan. AAP condemns any statement that may affect communal harmony,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/aap-urges-longowal-to-step-down-over-post-in-akali-dal/story-qaayuwSLio3IdtYdUDQKFI.html

The state government should take on the responsibility of all power, water and sewerage bills levied during the lockdown period and pay the same to the utilities from the disaster management fund, it demanded.The core committee took into account the crisis in the farming sector due to unavailability of labour due to which the farmers’ transplantation costs have more than doubled. “In case the government does not step in and give compensation of Rs 3,000 per acre to all paddy growers, the agrarian crisis in the state will deepen,” according to a party release.The committee also demanded that the government pay the power, water and sewerage bills for the entire three-month period of the lockdown from the State Disaster Management Fund. The meeting also passed resolutions demanding the Congress government give a complete account of the ₹5,600 crore revenue loss incurred by the excise department.It sought prosecution of Congress leaders Madan Lal Jalalpur and Hardyal Singh Kamboj for their alleged links with those running an illegal distillery-cum-bottling plant. Another decision was to bring all these issues to the notice of Governor VP Singh Badnore on June 11 and demand an inquiry into the liquor, seed and ration scams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-seeks-3-000-per-acre-compensation-for-farmers/story-EDYKUvK7wIek0BgkpllTEJ.html

A dormitory is also being built for BSF women personnel. The foundation stone of the project was laid in January 2019 by the then Union home minister Rajnath Singh. Currently, the BSF troops responsible for guarding the ICP and the joint check post (JCP) at Attari are housed in BSF’s Khasa headquarters, around 15 kilometers from the Attari-Wagah border. After the construction of the residential complexes, it will be convenient for the troopers to do their duty without any hassle, and they will remain available at the border anytime.The ICP facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan, and movement of passengers from India to the neighbouring country and vice-a-versa through the land border. The JCP is popular for beating the retreat ceremony performed jointly by the Indian and Pakistani security forces every evening. “Now we expect the project’s completion till October as we have somehow managed to arrange around two dozen labourers. Till now, 70% work has been completed,” said Sukhdev Singh, Land Port Authority of India (LPAI) manager at the ICP.Earlier, the LPAI officials had said the project was delayed due to the tension on the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/labour-crunch-hits-work-on-bsf-barracks-at-attari-deadline-extended/story-e4EQnw22ltQudxlp38v7vO.html

09-06-2020||City||Provide real-time data on Covid-19, HC tells Delhi govt and Centre||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court has directed the Centre and the Delhi government to update data in real-time on their mobile phone applications meant to disseminate information about availability of beds and other healthcare which is being provided to the patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) .A bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Prateek Jalan also directed the Centre and the Delhi government to carry out testing as far as far as possible, subject to availability of testing kits with priority being given to the persons approaching for test on the recommendation of a doctor.The court’s directions to the authorities came while hearing a plea it had initiated itself on the basis of a video clip of a man who had to run from pillar to post to get his mother hospitalised after she tested Covid-19 positive.On Monday, a detailed order of which was uploaded on the Delhi High Court website on Tuesday, the bench said that if any committee is appointed by Delhi government, it will also take note of the fact that the mobile application of the government should have real-time data.Advocate Om Prakash, amicus curiae in the case said that the mobile application namely “Delhi Corona Mobile Application”, developed by Delhi government, is not being updated regularly. He also submitted that there is a mismatch of the facts and data released by the government and private hospitals in Delhi especially with regard to the availability of beds and ventilators.He also contended that some of the hospitals run by Centre and the Delhi government are not updating the dataAdvocate Rahul Mehra, standing counsel (criminal), Delhi government and advocate Anuj Aggarwal, additional standing counsel for the Delhi government, told the court that told the capacity of 1031 helpline would be increased by adding more hunting lines so that more calls can be attended without any delay or waiting time.In an affidavit filed in the court, the Delhi government also told the court that much of the district-wise distribution data that Delhi receives from ICMR is incorrect, resulting in inordinate delay in the geo-station mapping carried out by authorities/agencies.“Thus, there is usually a delay caused in contacting the patient who has tested positive after he has received the lab-report and in the meantime patients tend to panic. The new helpline is aimed to cater to such patients only, especially during the first 24 to 36 hours, who have tested positive and are scared, yet clueless as to what should be their next course of action. The helpline would help them resolve issues pertaining to availability of ambulances and free medical consultation with a doctor,” the affidavit read.The government also said that they are adding more ambulances in the existing fleet. Following submissions from both sides, the court remarked, “it appears that there is a need of real time updation of the data by all hospitals including the Delhi government, the central government and private hospitals”.The bench asked both the authorities to file their replies with regards to the suggestion of the amicus curiae about availability of hospitals having multi speciality facilities for the corona patients.The matter would be now heard on June 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/provide-real-time-data-on-covid-19-hc-tells-delhi-govt-and-centre/story-BCTue0HPNyN2CPzd5bt1LK.html

09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Paddy sowing in Punjab: Panchayats pass resolutions fixing labour rates, govt terms move illegal||Panchayats in several districts of Punjab have passed resolutions fixing wages for farmhands for the paddy-sowing season as the demand for local labourers has increased in the wake of the return of migrant workers to their native states due to the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak. Some have even threatened non-compliance with social boycott and fine ranging between ₹5,000 and ₹25,000. But the state rural development and panchayats department has termed the move as illegal, saying the village bodies are not entitled to pass orders determining the labour rates. Though the department does not have a conclusive figure, labour unions say at least 40% of the total 13,262 panchayats in Punjab, particularly in Patiala, Sangrur, Muktsar, Mansa, Moga, Ferozepur and Bathinda districts, have passed such resolutions. Paddy sowing will start in the state on Wednesday. ₹2,500-₹3,200 for sowing on one acreAs per the resolutions passed by the panchayats, farm labourers will be paid anywhere between ₹2,500 and ₹3,200 for sowing paddy on one acre. On the other hand, farmhands are demanding ₹4,000-₹4,500 for per acre.Sukhijit Kaur, sarpanch of Muktsar district’s Bhalayiana village, said, “The resolution has been passed for the first time due to labour shortage. It will help both farmers and labourers as the rates decided suit both the parties.” Also, they have been asked to work in their villages on priority.Rajdeep Kaur, sarpanch of Ghanauri Khurd village in Sangrur district’s Dhuri block, said the resolution was passed to avoid confusion while hiring labourers. “The decision to bar labourers from providing their services at other villages was taken to cope with the shortage of labour,” she said.Moga’s Singhawala panchayat decided to increase the fine to ₹50,000, besides banning entry of labourers from other areas.Beant Singh Sidhu, sarpanch of Gurusar village in Bathinda, said, “We have decided to let the farmers and labourers negotiate the final rates.” ‘We have right to seek wages as per work’Punjab Khet Majdoor Union general secretary Lachhman Singh Sewewala said, “More and more panchayats are doing this. We have all the right to demand wages as per the requirement of work. How can a panchayat force the labourers to work in their villages only?”“Last year, migrant labourers were paid ₹2,700-₹3,200 for sowing paddy on per acre, and now the panchayats are offering the same rates. Threatening workers with social boycott and hefty fines is unconstitutional,” Sewewala said. Kashmir Singh, a labour activist, said, “We are not bonded labourers. Moreover, the panchayats have no right to decide anyone’s earnings,” Singh said.Rural development and panchayats department director DPS Kharbanda said, “These resolutions are illegal and we will cancel them once they are tabled. I have instructed the district-level officials across the state to stop this practice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/paddy-sowing-in-punjab-panchayats-pass-resolutions-fixing-labour-rates-govt-terms-move-illegal/story-SeO2DfQoDPjGiLy1RnojPK.html

A case has been registered against him for defying the government’s orders and the quarantine rule.“We registered a first information report (FIR) against the man for violating home quarantine rules. Further probe is underway,” said deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Ved Prakash Surya.When HT contacted Hari on his cellphone, he said his villagers did not allow him to enter the village and quarantined him at a local government hospital after they learnt that he was a Covid-19 patient. He alleged that he had no choice but to return to his village because his landlord, whose name he did not remember, forced him to leave the house.“My Covid-19 testing was done in the last week of May. I did not know that I was infected with the virus until some health officials came to my room and told me that my report came positive. They put a home quarantine notice outside the house and asked me to remain quarantined till further orders,” said Hari, who was working as a house-keeping staff at a private company in Delhi’s Daryaganj.Hari said he had come to Delhi for a job on March 16, just eight days before the nationwide lockdown was announced. He shifted to the west Karawal Nagar rented room in May. When his landlord learnt about his Covid-19 testing report and the home quarantine notice, he asked him to leave the room, Hari alleged.“I had nowhere to go and nobody was around to take care of me. I boarded a bus at Anand Vihar Bus terminal. My screening was done through a thermal scanner but they did not tell me my body temperature was high,” he said.A police officer privy to the case said they will look into Hari’s allegations.The case has been registered against him under section 3 of Epidemic Disease Act, and Indian Penal Code’s Sections 188 (Disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (Negligent act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life), 270 (Malignant act likely to spread infection of disease danger­ous to life), and 271 (Disobedience to quarantine rule).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-patient-in-home-quarantine-in-delhi-travels-to-home-town-in-up-case-registered/story-FOA01H9x0lFMxSt9mRs2QM.html

Their list of demands included manual filing of cases, physical presence of advocates during arguments and access to their chambers. The courts have been closed since March 23, 2020, because of the lockdown imposed to contain the spread of coronavirus. Ravinder Singh Bassi, former president of the district bar association (DBA), wrote to the district and sessions judge, highlighting the financial hardships faced by the advocates during the lockdown. “Most advocates do not have access to their lawyer’s chamber due to which, working from home has become impossible. Most do not even know how to go about with e-filing of cases. The worst-hit are those advocated who live in rented accommodations as they have no money to pay the rent.”Current DBA president NK Nanda said, “I had a word with the district and sessions judge. There is nothing in his hands. The call on reopening of courts will be taken by a committee constituted by the HC for all the lower courts of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh.”He added, “Currently urgent matters, including bail and stay, can be filed manually. There was no need to protest.

With this, the total number of cases has reached 326, of which 36 remain active.The fresh cases have been reported from Sector 16, 18 and 21 besides Daria village and Manimajra. With new cases surfacing from areas other than the Bapu Dham Colony containment zone, the UT administration has decided to examine whether the deadly virus has entered the community transmission stage in the city.The fresh cases include that of a 42-year-old man from Sector 18, who recently came in contact with a Himachal Pradesh resident who had returned from Delhi; a 28-year-old man from Subhash Nagar, Manimajra, who had returned from Gurugram on Sunday; and a 56-year-old woman from the hotspot Bapu Dham Colony.The fifth case is of a 35-year-old man from Sector 16, who is the son of a medical store owner. Both the medical store owner and his wife have recent travel history to Sangrur, Punjab, and are symptomatic. The patient has three other family contacts besides six community contacts who are working in his father’s shop in Sector 16. In the sixth case — that of a 43-year-old medicine distributor who works in Panchkula and resides in Sector 21 — the source of infection is not known yet.As UT health officials are scrambling to trace the source of infection in non-containment zones, the risk of community transmission was discussed during the daily review meeting chaired by UT administrator VPS Badnore on Tuesday. Community transmission is said to be taking place when the source of the contagion is not known, ie when it is not possible to trace the infection back to a carrier who has travelled to an affected area or through contact with a person who has the disease.Badnore asked the UT health secretary and doctors at Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) to examine the density of infection among various patients in Chandigarh and compare the data with other states.The administrator also directed the health authorities to keep all hospitals and health centres in readiness for accommodating patients, in case there is a second surge, as the borders are open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/with-sector-16-18-and-21-residents-among-6-fresh-cases-chandigarh-fears-community-transmission/story-0QHuDvF5DbJAoYre6y3hUO.html

The Pune-based company has partnered with AstraZeneca, a British biopharma giant, to ensure equitable supply of the AZD1222 vaccine doses to India as well as low-and-middle-income countries. “Our manufacturing facility is ready and we plan to start production in two months. We are spending more than USD 100 million for this facility. Till the trials are completed successfully for safety and efficacy, vaccines will not be distributed either in India or anywhere else in the world,” Adar Poonawalla, CEO, Serum Institute of India (SII), said. “Having said that we will start making a few millions of doses and stockpiling it at personal risk,” added Poonawalla, while plying to a question on the firm’s plans to move ahead in terms of production of the doses. To a question on how much doses India is likely to get in the first phase and by when they would be available, he said that it is a bit early to comment on a specific number. “However, if the vaccine trials succeed, India will gain access to the doses as it will also be the requirement of the Government of India. And we are certain that everybody will respect if the substantial volumes go to India,” he added. Earlier, Poonawalla, on tie-up with the British drug major had said, “SII is delighted to partner with AstraZeneca in bringing this vaccine to India as well as low-and-middle-income countries.” Over the past 50 years, SII has built significant capability in vaccine manufacturing and supply globally. “We will work closely with AstraZeneca to ensure fair and equitable distribution of the vaccine in these countries.” Talking about SII’s endeavour to develop a vaccine with USA based firm Codagenix, Poonawalla recently said that at present, the firm is undergoing pre-clinical trials (animal trial phase) and hope to progress to the human trial phase by September/October. “The aim is to make the vaccine over the next 1.5-2 years to help combat the novel coronavirus. With the combined efforts of our partner Codagenix, we are optimistic that we will be able to provide a viable and effective vaccine for mass use,” he had said. Besides, Oxford and Codagenix, the firm is also working with Austria’s Themis and other two vaccine candidates. At least half a dozen attempts at creating a vaccine against coronavirus are on globally and the efforts at Oxford are considered one of the most promising. A vaccine will be a radical intervention which can arrest the loss of lives due to the infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/serum-institute-investing-usd-100-million-on-potential-covid-19-vaccine/story-UeMx7ryEmzqjTOZZtJ1ryK.html
09-06-2020||City||Cong demands 70% beds be reserved for Covid patients, asks NHRC to intervene||New Delhi: Senior Delhi Congress leader Ajay Maken on Tuesday moved the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) seeking directions to the Delhi government and Centre to ensure that 70% of all available beds in city hospitals be reserved for Covid-19 patients.Maken alleged that even though the number of cases was rising in the national capital every day, only 8% of the total 57,194 available hospital beds in Delhi were being utilised for Covid-19 patients. Making a representation before the NHRC, Maken said people are “running from hospital to hospital for admission”, but are being turned away due to a “shortage of beds”. He said Delhi has robust healthcare infrastructure, with over 57,000 beds as well as central government hospitals to share the patient load.“It is extremely painful to see that only 12% of Delhi government hospital beds, 8% beds in central government institutions and 7% of private hospital beds are currently occupied and used to treat Covid patients. Moreover, in the case of Delhi government hospitals, around 70% of dedicated beds are vacant,” the former union minister said.He also claimed that the state government was not testing “as aggressively as it should”. His representation stated that 3,700 tests were conducted on Monday, as per the day’s government health bulletin, much less than the 7,649 tests conducted on May 29, and the lowest since May 15. “Despite the fact that Delhi’s recovery rate is among the lowest in the country, on June 4, eight labs were given notices to close for ‘over-testing’ by the government. These eight labs were testing about 4,000 patients per day. This means that we are now testing at least 4,000 fewer patients,” Maken said.Other recommendations included ways to expedite cremations, the introduction of norms to test suspects after their death, and strict inclusion of areas under containment zones based on the number of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-demands-70-beds-be-reserved-for-covid-patients-asks-nhrc-to-intervene/story-DrxB58h1cZKl8RvNLmLy4H.html

The restaurant located in Vishan Enclave on Najafgarh Road had opened on Monday after remaining shut during the lockdown. Senior officers said that hukkah was also being served in the party, which also is an offence under the Cigarettes and Other Tobacco Products Act. All the four accused were later released on bail, police said.Delhi government has allowed restaurants to resume operations Monday (June 8) onwards while ensuring social distancing and following the safety guidelines. Deputy commissioner of police (west) Deepak Purohit said in order to ensure zero violation of the safety guidelines issued during the Covid-19 pandemic, a police team that was conducting patrolling on Monday at Najafgarh Road, spotted some activity in Qubitos Restaurant in Vishan Enclave.“During checking it was found that a party was going on. There were a total of 38 people in the party and hukkah was also being served at the restaurant,” the DCP said.

Shivpal, on his official letterhead as the MLA of Jaswant Nagar, wrote a letter of thanks to Akhilesh in response to the SP’s move of withdrawing its plea seeking his disqualification as the member of the UP Legislative Assembly.Although as per the date on the letter, Shivpal wrote the letter to Akhilesh on May 29— a day after UP Assembly speaker HN Dixit allowed the withdrawal of the SP’s plea filed by senior SP leader and also the leader of opposition in UP Assembly Ram Govind Chaudhary on September 4, 2019—the message became public now. Shivpal addressed Akhilesh as ‘Dear’ and the ‘National President of Samajwadi Party’ and signed off as ‘With love, yours Shivpal Yadav’.In the message to Akhilesh, Shivpal says: “On your insistence, the legislative assembly speaker has returned the plea that had sought cancellation of my assembly membership. A million thanks for reposing faith. This certainly is not a mere political incident, but because of such a clear, constructive, and positive approach of yours it would also lead to the emergence of a new political alternative under your leadership.” With the withdrawal of the plea, Shivpal would indisputably stay an MLA from Jaswant Nagar assembly seat. Shivpal and Akhilesh Yadav had fallen out in August 2016. Akhilesh became the national president of SP in January 2017. Completely sidelined in the party, Shivpal Yadav had floated the PSP-L before the 2019 Lok Sabha elections and contested against SP’s official candidate and the then sitting MP Akshay Yadav from Firozabad. However, both lost as the BJP wrested the seat from the SP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/shivpal-writes-to-akhilesh-talks-of-new-political-alternative/story-XBzHZomUWymxMOnuFJ5GDO.html

09-06-2020||City||AAP cries foul as Sangrur Women College stops BA admission||The Akal Degree College for Women here has decided to stop admissions to its BA course for the academic session 2020-21, triggering furore among the Aam Aadmi Party, student unions and dalit outfits in the district.Leader of opposition (LOP) Harpal Singh Cheema wrote to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday seeking the state government’s immediate intervention.“Over 40% students here are from the SC community and the rest are from economically weaker sections of the society. But the college management wants to gradually shut operations, and the CM is not paying heed to the issue. The college has been run by grants from the UGC for decades, but now the management wants to start a school in its place,” said Cheema.As per information, Akal Degree College for Women was established in 1970 and there were 460 girl students in seven different streams, including BA, BCA, BCOM, BVOC, and MSC IT but, of these, 289 students were enrolled in the three-year BA course in 2019-20.“The college management is trying to convert the institute into a profitable business but the entire infrastructure was built with government funds. AAP will oppose this decision and would hold a protest against the move,” the LOP added.Punjab Students’ Union (PSU) activists termed the decision ‘anti-women’ and announced to intensify agitation against the management.“We will hold meetings with parents who want to admit their daughters in the college and will not allow the management to shut down the college,” said Sukhdeep Singh, district chief of PSU.Mukesh Malaudh, president of Zameen Prapti Sangharsh Committee (ZPSC), a dalit outfit, said the college is a ray of hope for girls from the poor sections and the committee will mobilise people in villages to build a struggle to save the college.Akal Group of Colleges chairman Karanvir Singh Sibia said the degree college was facing huge losses and could not afford more economic burden.“The enrolment in BA-1 has been decreasing. We have written to Punjabi University, Patiala, to stop admissions at the entry point. The final decision will be taken by the director of public instructions, but the college will not be closed,” added Sibia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-cries-foul-as-sangrur-women-college-stops-ba-admission/story-O5hicCkqkPhwTBhGd0GhDP.html

09-06-2020||City||Punjab farmers go for direct seeding of paddy, cover 7 lakh hectares under water-saving technology||Amid the shortage of migrant farm labourers and higher charges demanded by locally available workers, farmers in the state have shown significant interest in the direct seeding of rice (DSR).As per information, nearly 7 lakh hectares of land have been mechanically cultivated till Tuesday, moving away from the traditional practice of sowing nursery and then transplanting the same.While DSR started from June 1, the conventional rice transplantation in puddled fields will commence from Wednesday.Raja Singh, a farmer from Bathinda’s Kahan Singh Wala village, said his expense has decreased significantly after adopting the mechanised sowing.“I opted DSR to overcome the problem of shortage of farm workers. My cost input per acre with mechanised sowing was just ₹800 for the hired seed driller. Last year, I paid about ₹3,200 per acre for manual sowing. Paddy seeds have already germinated in the field,” said Raja, who owns 32 acres of land.Another farmer from Muktsar’s Smalsar village, Diljinder Singh, said as the migrant workers are unable to reach Punjab for the sowing this season, the locally available farmers have started demanding up to ₹5,000 per acre.“Farmers are unable to meet the steep increase in labour cost. But DSR is not only highly cost-effective, it also save water and electricity as opposed to the conventional method,” he said.A progressive farmer from Kotshamir in Bathinda, Sandeep Singh, said his 11-year long experience of DSR has been very encouraging. “I am able to save up to ₹4,500 per acre with DSR by way of cost-cutting on labour and water. Yield per acre is also good. In the current situation where labour availability is a challenge, DSR is a good alternative for paddy farmers,” he said.Bathinda chief agriculture officer Bahadur Singh Sidhu said the district has seen direct sowing on 22,000-hectare area since June 1. “We expect the figure to grow further in the next fortnight,” he added.State agriculture secretary KS Pannu said the department had set the target to bring 5 lakh hectares under the DSR system.“We have already exceeded 7-lakh hectare area, with 4,000 specialised DSR machines purchased by farmers. Also, scores of wheat sowing machines have been modified by farmers to sow paddy. Our engineering department is also guiding farmers on how to modify the machines by spending as little as only ₹1,000 per machine,” said Pannu.Principal agronomist of Punjab Agriculture University Dr MS Bhullar revealed that the field inputs on adoption of DSR are encouraging.“It is for the first time that farmers across the state have expressed their interest in the technology that is less time-consuming and not at all labour-intensive. They should consult farm experts in case of any problems faced with the mechanised sowing,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-farmers-go-for-direct-seeding-of-paddy-cover-7-lakh-hectares-under-water-saving-technology/story-QCPpLbah5hS9Mcq5bRqJML.html

Already there was huge uncertainty among job aspirants in J&K due to the new domicile rules. The SRO-202 has increased it further,” stated Tarigami in his letter.“Employment opportunities in Jammu and Kashmir are already far and few. With new domicile rules and SRO-202, the educated youth in the region will feel suffocated and nowhere to go. The SRO 202, issued by the general administration department (GAD) on June 30, 2015, prescribes that a person shall be on probation of five years, and during this period, the appointee shall be entitled to only the basic pay and not any of the allowances. It is discriminatory and denies due increment to employees who are appointed into the government service,” he added.The move since its implementation has been facing opposition from both government employees as well as the youth in J&K. CPI(M) has been opposing this SRO as it has a detrimental effect on the service of the appointees and can lead to paying anomaly in the future. Already the Law Commission headed by Justice (retired) M K Hanjura had recommended reduction in probation period from five to two years under SRO-202.“I urge the J&K administration to look into the matter and withdraw this discriminatory SRO so that the newly appointed employees of Jammu and Kashmir administration are not placed at the disadvantageous position,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cpi-m-leader-my-tarigami-urges-j-k-l-g-to-scrap-sro-202/story-l0b81HTZEPSd9i1vwLLvlJ.html

09-06-2020||City||Cong sarpanch killed by terrorists: Kin, political leaders seek protection for Kashmiri Pandits||A day after sarpanch and Congress leader Ajay Pandita alias Bharti was shot dead by terrorists in Anantnag district of Jammu and Kashmir, his kin and many political leaders raised demands of protection for Kashmiri Pandits in the Valley.The slain leader was cremated in Jammu earlier on Tuesday. Bharti was the sarpanch of Lukbawan village in the Larkipora area.“We won’t leave Kashmir but I urge the government to create a regiment of the Kashmiri Pandits in the Valley,” said Vijay Pandita, brother of the deceased.“He loved his roots and always extended a helping hand to the needy. After becoming a sarpanch he had decided to work for the welfare of Muslims,” he added.Bharti’s father Dwarika Nath Pandita said, “We came to Kashmir in 1996. At that time, Ajay was around 21-year-old. He used to say that Kashmir is our home. Some anti-nationals are behind his killing.”Calling it a cowardly act, Lieutenant-Governor Girish Chandra Murmu condemned the killing and said that those behind the killing are enemies of humanity. “Attack on any public representative is an attack on democracy,” he said.In December last year, Bharti had told the media that there was a threat to his life and had repeatedly asked for security.Dr Mahesh Kaul, a prominent writer on Kashmir and a community leader, said, “The killing of Ajay is another example of this jihadi paramilitary society to continue the genocide of Kashmiri Pandits and the Indian state keeps on buying the half separatist theory of secularism via Kashmiriyat (“Cash-miriyat).”All Parties Migrant Coordination Committee (APMCC) leader Vinod Pandit said, “We condemn the killing of Ajay Pandita. He was always under threat for being a Kashmiri Pandit sarpanch. A probe is needed in the matter.”Meanwhile, Congress questioned lapses to provide security to the slain leader. Senior leaders of the JKPCC have questioned the government’s failure to provide adequate security to Bharti, despite him being an elected representative and leader of a minority community residing in one of the most vulnerable areas in Kashmir.All Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat Conference (AJKPC) also condemned the killing and said that such cowardly attacks will not deter them from strengthening the democracy at the grassroots level in the UT.The AJKPC reiterated its demand for security to its members and advocated adequate compensation to family of the deceased.“Pandita was the vice-president of the AJKPC and played a great role in strengthening the organisation. His killing is an attack on democracy and a direct fallout of the frustration among terror ranks due to back-to-back successful operations which resulted in killing of nine militants in the past two days in Shopian,” said AJKPC president Anil Sharma.Meanwhile, the AJKPC has demanded adequate security for the elected sarpanches and panches.In last panchyat elections held in December 2018, a total of 22,214 panches and 3,459 sarpanches were elected of total 33,592 panch and 4,290 sarpanch constituencies.Hizbul Mujahideen involved in killing of sarpanch: Cops Police have claimed that militants of Hizbul Mujahideen were involved in the killing of Congress sarpanch Ajay Pandita alias Bharti in Anantnag.J&K DGP Dilbag Singh said the sarpanch was killed by Hizbul Mujahideen militants.Police said unidentified gunmen had attacked Bharti at his orchard on Monday afternoon.Locals said Bharti’s family had migrated from south Kashmir in early ’90s but he had returned a couple of years back and contested the panchayat polls.State BJP spokesperson Altaf Thakur asked the L-G administration to provide security to all sarpanches and panches.“We have been demanding security since long. So far, nothing has been done. We urge police to provide security to the leaders,” he said.Thakur said militants are not happy with development, adding that culprits involved in Pandita’s killing will be taken to task soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-sarpanch-killed-by-terrorists-cremated-in-jammu/story-X7MXghfjEjRvTixq29mBoM.html

The case dates back to April 2012 when Canadian NRI Navneet Singh Chatha, who was visiting the city and residing in Sector 18, was kidnapped and taken to a farm house in Kurukshetra.As per the prosecution, the convicts made the victim call his brother in Canada and ask for Rs 1 crore citing a land deal. Navneet made the call but dropped a hint due to which his brother got suspicious and informed the police from Canada. The victim used to call his brother “Ginnu” or “Garry” but on the fateful day, he addressed him by his full name Gurneet Singh Chatha and asked for the money. A UT crime branch team had rescued the NRI within 24 hours of kidnapping, after conducting a raid in which exchange of fire also took place. The police had arrested six persons, identified as Pradeep Malik, 31, Sanjeev Kumar alias Soni, 36, Anil Kumar, 37, Ajit Singh, 28, Nitin, 28, and Sukhdev, 38, on charges of kidnapping, robbery and wrongful confinement. All the convicts hail from different districts of Haryana. They were convicted by the trial court and awarded life sentence in September 2016.‘NO EVIDENCE’The high court bench of justice Jitendra Chauhan and justice Archana Puri, while modifying the trial court order, observed that there is absolutely no evidence of ransom calls made to the NRI’s brother in Canada even as mobile numbers of all the accused were recovered. “In the light of the same, phono-connectivity as asserted (by prosecution), does not stand established. Consequently, the demand of ransom amount, as such does not stand proved,” the bench said while dropping the charges of ransom demand. Kidnapping entails a jail term of 10 years but for demanding ransom upon kidnap, a person can be awarded a life or even death sentence. On the kidnapping charges, the bench said the abduction stands amply established, even though the victim had property-dealing interaction with one of the accused and had voluntarily gone with him in a car. The other accused had joined in later and threatened the NRI with a gun and taken to Kurukshetra, where he was confined in a room in a farmhouse. The UT police had also recovered Rs 12.5 lakh, 300 Canadian dollars, a Honda Accord car robbed from the victim, and a Maruti Swift Dzire car robbed from a person in Panchkula. The victim had appeared through video conferencing, claiming threat to his life.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/2012-nri-kidnapping-case-hc-turns-life-sentence-into-10-year-jail-for-six-convicts/story-uZntEt7iWF9z5AVuuG3K2L.html

Even after the lockdown, no cases were reported in Himachal and many patients had been cured. “Though Covid-19 cases in the state increased when Himachal residents returned from other states, it was the state government’s responsibility to bring them back,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-dept-scam-hp-education-minister-challenges-congress-to-file-chargesheet/story-Dbjoa2PbJ0jD9X8wTleciI.html
09-06-2020||City||Pune keeps Covid on pregnant pause with aggressive testing, strict delivery protocol||PUNE Three months into the pandemic in Pune and city obstetricians claim there is evidence of any case in the city where the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes the Covid-19 infection is transmitted from an infected pregnant woman to her new-born child.Dr Madhuri Rokade, resident medical officer at the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) Sonawane hospital, said, “Our hospital was opened exclusively for Covid-19 positive women on May 2 and since then, we have had three deliveries.” “ICMR guidelines state that a pregnant woman must be tested for Covid-19 five days before the date of delivery. There have been reports in some studies globally that the infection could cause pre-term delivery, but no such incident has been recorded in Pune yet, however, it would be too soon to say it cannot happen,” Dr Rokade added.The civic body has been actively surveying pregnant women who are then followed up with, randomly, to check for any flu-like symptoms.The civic body has conducted door-to-door surveys in which 2,502 pregnant women in the city were identified in containment zones as of June 5. Of these 2,502 women, Hadapsar ward has 648, followed by Bhavani peth (378) and Aundh (233) – the three areas with the highest number of pregnant women. The PMC’s mobile swab collection van focuses on comorbid, pregnant and senior citizens, all of whom are tested for Covid-19.Dr Rokade details how strict care is taken to ensure safety of all involved in the delivery process.“We adhere to the strict guidelines of wearing PPEs at the time of delivery. The woman is given an N95 mask and every person, including the ward boy and sanitation staff, who enter the operation theatre is given a PPE kit. Since there is no proof that the virus enters the placenta the only source of infection from a mother to a baby are respiratory droplets, which is possible during breastfeeding. Once the baby is delivered we check the baby for infection on the fifth day and if the result is negative, the baby is handed over to a relative,” she said. PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “The civic body has taken four major steps which includes creating a separate hospital for Covid-19 positive pregnant woman which is the Sonawane hospital. We also started surveying pregnant woman across the city and focused on them by following up on symptoms and testing. We also have tied up with a private hospital to treat Covid-19 positive pregnant women. Finally, we have reserved maternity wards for non-Covid-19 pregnant women.”Dr Rajeshwari Pawar, obstetrician and gynaecologist, Motherhood hospital, said, “The fear of infection if mothers-to-be go to a multi-speciality hospital is more, since there is no guarantee that a person who comes to a hospital is not Covid-19 positive. Since maternity hospitals have pregnant women who have been tested and are found negative, there is some assurance. Also, all appointments are done in phases - be it delivery, vaccinations or routine check-ups.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-keeps-covid-on-pregnant-pause-with-aggressive-testing-strict-delivery-protocol/story-vtzdahKKJPcOgYklQPzBaP.html

09-06-2020||Mumbai||Bombay HC directs Arnab Goswami to remain present at police station on June 10||The Bombay high court on Tuesday directed Republic TV chief Arnab Goswami to attend NM Joshi Marg police station on June 10 for interrogation with regards to the two FIRs registered against him in NM Joshi Marg police station as well as Pydhonie Police Station. Goswami had filed petitions in the Bombay high court seeking quashing of the FIRs against him in the two police stations. The court has posted the petitions for hearing Friday. The division bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Riyaz Chagla while hearing the criminal writ petition of Arnab Goswami filed through advocate Madhavi Doshi seeking various reliefs included quashing of the two FIR’s filed against him on April 22 and May 2 with regards to the reporting of the April 14 protest of migrants at Bandra station. Senior counsel Harish Salve for Goswami submitted that multiple FIRs had been filed across the country for the same incidents, and as per a Supreme Court order multiple FIRs in different states for the same incident were not sustainable, hence the FIR filed against Goswami should be quashed. While referring to section 153 under which Goswami has been booked, Salve submitted that no offence was made out under the section. He also said that as Pydhonie police station was in a containment zone, Goswami should be exempted from reporting there on June 10. However, senior counsel Kapil Sibal who appeared for the state of Maharashtra along with public prosecutor Deepak Thakare and additional public prosecutor SR Shinde submitted that the allegations made against Goswami in the FIRs were sensitive in nature hence he should be asked to attend the police station to enable them to complete their investigations. After hearing the submissions, the bench directed Goswami to attend NM Joshi Marg police station on June 10, instead of Pydhonie police station and asked the Pydhonie police to conduct its interrogation there instead. The court also restrained the police from arresting Goswami and posted the matter for hearing on Friday June 12.When advocate Doshi was contacted she refused to speak.Goswami has been accused of instigating hatred against the Muslim community while anchoring a programme on the protests by migrants outside Bandra Station. The FIR at Pydhonie police station has stated that Goswami during the programme had targeted the mosque outside the station though it had nothing to do in the gathering of migrants.ere. Story here.

09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal education minister dares Congress to submit chargesheet on health ‘scam’||Education minister Suresh Bhardwaj on Tuesday called the Congress’ allegations of the government being involved in a health scam baseless. “The allegations of fiscal irregularities in the purchase of ventilators are totally baseless,” Bhardwaj said: “Instead of making frivolous allegations and issuing anonymous letters the Congress should submit a chargesheet.”Bhardwaj said the Jai Ram Thakur-led BJP government’s tenure had been full of remarkable achievements and providing clean, transparent and sensitive governance were its primary feats. “Afraid of the government’s growing popularity, the Congress is levelling baseless charges against the BJP regime,” said Bhardwaj.“During their term,” the education minister said, “Congress leaders were probed by the CBI and other investigative agencies and had to face charges in court.”He said the government had filed an FIR against the anonymous people who had levelled charges of corruption in the ventilator purchase.The education minister said the allegation that the government had purchased ventilators worth ₹3.5 lakh for ₹10.29 lakh had been found to be false.“In fact, the government has not made any such purchase. There are several panels of officers at the directorate level in the health department which oversee the purchase of medical equipment,” he said.These committees look into every aspect including pricing before making a purchase. The purchases made by other states are also studied.“The ₹3.5 lakh ventilators spoken of in the anonymous letter is a demonstration unit which is given to the dealer and cannot be sold,” he said, confirming that the actual price of ventilators was ₹10.3 lakh.As far as purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) kits is concerned, there was nothing irregular about it, he said. The health department bought 14,500 PPE kits on April 21 and spent ₹1.84 crore.After the supply of PPE kits from HLL became smooth, the purchase was stopped.“After an audiotape surfaced in which an officer of health department was heard seeking bribe, the matter was immediately handed over to vigilance bureau,” said Bhardwaj.Similarly, the government took swift action in the sanitiser purchase scam.The government’s actions reflect its zero-tolerance policy against corruption, said Bhardwaj, cautioning the opposition party to refrain from playing petty politics in times of pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/himachal-education-minister-dares-congress-to-submit-chargesheet-on-health-scam/story-G91EBawdxIczWZUNHjJilM.html

We are analysing the footage, videos and images, to identify the perpetrators,” said senior police inspector Ravindra Jadhav of the Chinchwad police station.According to the police, the crowd broke open the containment seals made of tin and charged at the police shelter built outside the containment zone. The two-wheelers parked by the police officials were pushed into gutters and chairs were thrown while stones were allegedly pelted by the residents, according to the police.“Five police vehicles were destroyed.

09-06-2020||Kolkata||No end to commuters’ woes in Bengal as limited number of buses hit streets||Commuters in the city and other parts of West Bengal faced a harrowing time reaching workplaces on the second consecutive day of “Unlock 1” on Tuesday with public transport yet to pick up pace in the state, even as most offices and business establishments resumed normal operations.Private bus operators claimed that the number of vehicles operated in Kolkata and its suburbs on Tuesday marginally increased compared to the day before, as 30 per cent of the fleet hit roads.Other modes of public transport such as metro rail and local trains are yet to recommence operations.Shopping malls and restaurants, among other establishments, reopened in Bengal on Monday after a gap of over two months with the state government allowing further relaxations as part of “Unlock-1”, the first phase of a calibrated exit from the coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown.Bus operators’ associations said that drivers and helpers experienced hiccups in some pockets, where a large number of people were waiting to board buses.“In some areas, buses ran with a handful of passengers, while in others, people stood in hordes to board the vehicles. We are chalking out a strategy to maintain frequency as per demand,” general secretary of the Joint Council of Bus Syndicates, Tapan Banerjee, said.Long queues were witnessed at various places in south and north Kolkata, including Jadavpur, Garia, Hazra, Exide Crossing, Shyambazar and Dunlop, as commuters complained that they had been waiting for at least an hour on an average to get buses to their destination.Rahul Chatterjee, the general secretary of the All Bengal Bus Minibus Samannoy Samity, however, said the rush of passengers was somewhat less than what it was on Monday.Buses operators have been told not to carry passengers in excess of their seating capacity by the state government, but the rule was openly flouted in several parts of the city and other districts of West Bengal, as people, tired of waiting in queues, got on to vehicles by force.State transport undertaking buses were seen plying on the streets in the morning, but with hundreds of commuters waiting, these were not enough to clear the rush.Taxis, app-based cabs and auto-rickshaws were also available across the city on the second day of “Unlock 1”.Many people rode motorcycles and bicycles to work to avoid crowds.As one of them put it, “It is safer to cycle to work than take the risk of travelling in a crowded bus in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic.” Footfall at shopping malls were low in the morning, but store owners said the turnout was expected to increase later in the day.All major shopping complexes in the city, including South City, City Centre I and II, Acropolis, threw open their doors on Monday, barring the Forum Mall, which said it would do so next week.Visitors are allowed at the malls between 11 am and 8 pm. Children below 10 years of age and senior citizens above 65 years, however, have been barred from entering the malls for now, as they are considered vulnerable to the coronavirus disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/no-end-to-commuters-woes-in-bengal-as-limited-number-of-buses-hit-streets/story-aJKW3Da1RiyrWhzAplibuJ.html

Watch | Covid: Sisodia says 88,000 beds needed by July end, slams Delhi LG Baijal The meeting was chaired by Baijal, who is the head of the State Disaster Management Authority, and attended by Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain and officials of the central government among others. If the cases kept doubling in every 12-13 days in the coming days, there will be shortage of beds and Delhiites will bear the brunt, the Delhi deputy CM said, using this as the justification for his government’s order on hospital beds.“This is the reason the Delhi cabinet had decided to reserve the beds only for the city residents but it was overturned by the L-G. Now, who will take the responsibility if the cases keep on increasing and the beds are full?” he asked.The Lt Governor, who is also the Chairman of Delhi Disaster Management Authority, had in his order on Monday said that “treatment should not be denied to any patient on grounds of being a non-resident”.Talking about the Baijal’s order, Sisodia told reporters that the L-G is refusing to reconsider his decision.“The L-G refuses to reconsider his decision to overrule Delhi government’s order reserving state-run and private hospitals for Delhiites,” he said. Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said that of the new cases being reported in the city, nearly 50% are those with unknown source of infection.Delhi’s L-G Anil Baijal has called a meeting of political parties on Tuesday afternoon to discuss the prevailing situation due to Covid-19.

They also blamed the centre for the plight of the migrant workers and also for the recent spike in Covid-19 cases all over the country.This is the first time that the Trinamool Congress brought forth the issue of the recent tensions along the international borders with China.The Centre and the state government had locked horns in April and May over alleged Covid-19 data fudging by the state government and the state’s alleged reluctance in bringing back the migrant workers.Leaders of the BJP Bengal unit hoped that apart from describing the second Narendra Modi government’s successes in the past one year, Shah will also highlight how the state government mishandled the pandemic along with causing distress to the migrant workers.After Shah stung the state government on issues related to political violence, corruption, politics of appeasement, politicisation of people’s welfare and other administrative failures, Abhishek Banerjee wrote in another tweet, “As usual the speech of @AmitShah Ji was all rhetoric and no substance. Nonetheless since he has talked about his dream of seeing ‘EXIT’ of TMC, I would like to ask him one more time - “When are the Chinese EXITING our territory” #BengalRejectsAmitShah.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/take-a-minute-mamata-banerjee-s-nephew-jabs-shah-ahead-of-bengal-address/story-aAVKBC1c9lG5ZdRsXyVANL.html

09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab panchayats pass resolutions to fix labourers’ wages; threaten dissenters with social boycott, hefty fines||With demand for local labourers increasing as the paddy season draws closer, panchayats in Punjab have started issuing ‘diktats’ to finalise wages for sowing paddy. Some have also threatened dissenters with social boycott and hefty penalties. The paddy season will commence from June 10. As per the resolutions passed by the panchayats, farm labourers will be paid Rs 2,500-Rs 3,200 per acre for sowing paddy. Labourers have also been barred from moving out of village for work.Sukhijit Kaur, sarpanch of Muktsar’s Bhalayiana village, said, “Such a resolution has been passed for the first time due to labour shortage. It will help both farmers and labourers as the rates decided suit both parties.” The acute shortage of labour due to mass exodus of the migrant labourers from state during lockdown has driven up the rates of local labour. Labourers are demanding Rs 4,000-4,500 per acre, which is a steep increase from last year’s Rs 2,800 per acre.Farmers and labourers are at loggerheads with the latter demanding higher wages, and the former reluctant to oblige.THREATS ISSUED However, some resolutions passed by villages, especially in the southern districts of Punjab, primarily Bathinda, Muktsar, Sangrur and Patiala, are threatening in nature. A few panchayats have proposed socially boycotting labourers should they demand more wages than the stipulated rates.Though the department of rural development does not yet have the exact number of panchayats that have passed such orders, officials say villages are increasingly following the trend.The panchayat of Ghanauri Khurd village in Dhuri block of Sangrur district went so far to direct the labourers to carry their own utensils for tea and lunch. Similar directions were issued in the resolution passed by Kharayal village of the Sangrur district. Ghanauri Khurd village sarpanch Rajdeep Kaur said the resolution had been passed so as to avoid confusion while hiring labourers.“The decision to bar labourers from providing their services at other villages was taken to cope with shortage of labour,” she said.RS 5,000-RS 25,000 FINES TO BE IMPOSED The resolutions have also stipulated a fine ranging between Rs 5,000-Rs 25,000, which will be imposed in case either party violates the panchayats’ directions.Moga’s Singhawala village has decided to increase the fine to Rs 50,000, besides banning entry of labourers from other areas.‘UNEASY CALM PREVAILS’Bhinder Singh, the husband of Bathinda’s Jeeda village sarpanch Kulwinder Kaur, said an uneasy calm prevails among farmers and labourers as the local labourers were demanding exorbitant. “The resolutions have been passed so that farmers are not burdened and labourers are not underpaid,” he said.Meanwhile, Gurusar village sarpanch Beant Singh Sidhu said they had dropped the idea of fixing labour prices after drafting a detailed resolution.“We have decided to let farmers and labourers negotiate the final prices and other terms and conditions,” he said. RESOLUTIONS UNACCEPTABLE, SAY LABOUR UNIONSThe resolutions have not gone down well with labour unions.Punjab Khet Majdoor Union general secretary Lachhman Singh Sewewala said the resolutions were illegitimate.“We have all the right to demand wages as per the requirement of work. How can a village panchayat force labourers to work in the village only?” he asked.“Last year, migrant labourers were paid Rs 2,700-3,200 for sowing paddy per acre, and now panchayats are offering the same rates to us,” Sewewala said.Panchayats are threatening social boycott and hefty fines, which is unconstitutional, he said. Kashmir Singh, a labour activist and Punjab executive member of the Communist party of India, said village panchayats should immediately roll back their resolutions.“We are not bonded labour and should be included in decision making. Moreover, the panchayat has no right to decide anybody’s earnings,” Singh said.DEPARTMENT SAYS RESOLUTIONS ARE ILLEGAL Punjab rural development and panchayats department director of DPS Kharbanda said, “Gram panchayats are not entitled to pass orders determining the wages of labourers. These resolutions are illegal and we will cancel all such resolutions once they are tabled.”“I have already instructed district-level officials across the state to check and stop such practices,” he said.The agriculture department has estimated that around 12.5 lakh labourers will be required to sow paddy in 30 days. Most labour available in villages belong to dalit communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-panchayats-pass-resolutions-to-fix-labourers-wages-threaten-dissenters-with-social-boycott-hefty-fines/story-0mqWRvVsqi94UJ4lFeiAGK.html
09-06-2020||Today's||Obituary to an ordinary day in extraordinary times||Time, it seems, has no future. Homo sapiens suddenly woke up to a new reality after Circa 2020 dawned. One fine day, something happened just like in science fiction and the trajectory of time, and life, changed. Hence, this obituary to the disappearance of an ordinary day.But how does one write an obituary to a day? How does one weave a eulogy of a time gone forever? Time is rapidly diminishing all around us and we humans with the largest brain are at our wits’ end as an uncertain future awaits us.What were we really thinking in our longer, richer lives? Did we just stop one day to stare at the small hands begging, while we sat complaining in an air-conditioned car? Why am I asking difficult questions? Because I’m a singular being trying to pluck the courage and write an obituary to times gone by.The great expectations attitude post-industrial revolution made human beings think life as 50-year investment bonds. We had no time on a beautiful ordinary day to think where we were going. The haves and have-nots were in a rush to eke out a life of desires.But now, the ordinary day is dead. Our socio-political system may have to be buried with respect to the ordinary day. Authoritarian regimes and even democracies can morph into centralised governing bodies as we face more tragedies, deaths, loss of jobs and a sense of fierce uncertainty of another day. Our months could seem like centuries as we may face dehumanisation in the race to survive. Want will test us to the extreme.As I wish the ordinary day goodbye, I also want to bury my bias and wrong sense of social distribution of the earth’s resources. I want the grave to accommodate my acceptance of huge inequalities in my earthly journey. I hang my head in shame that I let my voice, however small, diminish and disappear as I was too busy living the ordinary day. I became a slave to my lifestyle.How many of the vulnerable and unfortunate were eliminated as it became normal? This century has witnessed the death of free speech and the freedom to dissent with the political system. No wonder our imagination stumbles beyond 2020.History and time have changed in the last century. Two world wars; and if that was not enough, we armed ourselves with nuclear weapons. No one thought that we were self-sabotaging and destructing our beautiful “home” known as earth in the cosmos. A small warm home with a sun, a moon, water to drink and air to breathe sufficed but greed was in our genes. Adam and Eve’s progeny could not resist messing up. Somehow, everything has changed with the demise of the ordinary day. Millions walking home remind me of the fallacy of life. In its place, I don’t know if time will have a future for us. The era of hugs and wearing lipstick will come back to us, but when? Holding hands just for the heck of it; coffee at the crowded Indian Coffee House and the ruthless rhythm of living a life. The symphony of chaos but with your sad demise ordinary day, the new day being touted to us has a horrible cold name. It’s distance. What will we morph into in two years and maybe in a decade? Till then, rest in peace my friend. We will all miss you. Get nostalgic and reminisce. Is there time for us and a future in time? There are honestly no answers.The writer is a Kapurthala-based farmer and freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/obituary-to-an-ordinary-day-in-extraordinary-times/story-aPjFlvv9UAqQfjBP51CodL.html

We tried to negotiate with our landlord, but he didn’t agree to any sort of relief at all,” says Priyanka Malhotra, director, Full Circle Bookstore. It was not an easy time, but their other landlords — in Greater Kailash and Nizamuddin outlets — were more accommodating. “Quite a few shops are leaving Khan Market. It comes down to the math, unfortunately. We were not earning anything for the past three months. The losses are in lakhs,” she says.   As we close our doors in Khan Market, we would like to THANK each and everyone for their support, love and affection for Full Circle and Cafe Turtle. We would not have created this legacy without YOU. A special thank you to @kanishka.gupta.754 and @arunavasinha for giving us a voice to share our special journey..... @scroll_inA post shared by  Full Circle & Cafe Turtle (@fullcircleandcafeturtle) on Jun 7, 2020 at 8:02am PDTThe bookstore, with its winding staircase leading to the warmly-lit first floor full of shelves with enchanting titles, the corner landing opening to the iconic Café Turtle, was known as much for its turquoise and green interiors as for its old-world hospitality. They now plan to open the bookstore in Meharchand Market with an additional bookshop dedicated solely to children’s books. Café Turtle will also make a comeback. “We will wait a month or two because we need to understand the (new) guidelines of operating a kitchen. Food is a different thing; it requires far more engagement and there is a lot of tactile involvement,” she says. The bookstore will open any time within the coming week. “We already have the team and the stock; it’s just a question of doing up the store our way. Until the café opens, we plan to have a coffee machine in the bookshop so that it remains alive in some way,” she elaborates.Read: Good news for Capital’s bookworms: Bookstores will deliver to your doorstep amid lockdown 3.0The journey, which began with her mother Poonam Malhotra in the year 1998, has come a full circle, with the daughter now at the helm of things as the bookstore undergoes a journey of its own. “We started in Santushti. I was in college and would be there during my summer holidays. It was another world. People would browse, review books — it was a slower kind of world,” she reminisces. When the move came, her parents, and a couple of friends, set up the café, painted the walls.In the beginning, her mother would bake from home and this continued even at the Khan Market store. It was the early 2000s. Café culture was something people saw on American sitcoms or heard of from their NRI relatives. Commercial coffee chains were yet to mushroom. “You either had a five-star hotel to go for a cup of coffee, or a dhaba — it was that extreme. My mother thought how nice would it be to have a cup of coffee and read a book, but where does one do that here? That’s how it all came about,” she says.   You don’t need a special occasion to treat yourself to cake!

Each grew into the other, merging to create a space that went beyond the physical. “We have a gem of a team and they have been with us for ages. It’s really something special that’s been created,” she says.For many, the tryst with a bookstore is nothing short of an experiential journey. A journey taken across worlds, under a cozy nook we claim our own. A bookstore, then, ceased to be a mere physical entity.

The elderly man was allegedly tied to the hospital bed on non-payment of the hospital bill of Rs 11,270 three days ago, the police said.The charges levelled against the hospital by patient Laxminarayan Dangi, a resident of Ranara village in Rajgarh district, and his daughter Sheelabai were found legit by the district administration after which and an FIR was lodged with Kotwali police station. The patient had filed a complaint under section 342 (wrongful confinement) of Indian Penal Code (IPC), police officials said.Dangi and his daughter had alleged that the hospital staff tied his legs and hands to the hospital bed when they failed to clear the final bill of the hospital to the tune of Rs 11,270 before Dangi was to be discharged from the hospital on Friday.As a video of the patient tied to the bed went viral on social media, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan took note of the incident and assured strict action. An inquiry was instituted by district collector Dinesh Jain on Saturday night.Shajapur district collector Dinesh Jain said, “Prima facie charges against the hospital staff were found true, hence the FIR against the manager of the hospital Nitesh Sharma under section 342 of IPC has been filed. The hospital was sealed and its registration has been suspended. There was no patient admitted to the hospital at the time of the sealing of the hospital. The outpatient department (OPD)’s patients were moved to the district hospital.”The collector further added, “The hospital management in its defence said that they had tied the patient to the bed to administer medicines to him as he was having convulsions. But during the inquiry, it was found that the way the patient had been tied didn’t appear to be the case as the hospital management presented. Also, the hospital management’s logic didn’t appear to be convincing because the patient was admitted to the hospital on June 1 but was tied to the bed on June 5. If he was having convulsions he could have been tied earlier too. However, a final decision on the hospital will be taken later after due proceedings.”Kotwali police station in-charge Ajit Tiwari said, “Nitesh Sharma, the manager of the hospital who is a resident of Shajapur has been arrested. Since the crime committed under section 342 of the IPC is bailable, he was released on bail from the police station.”Despite efforts, owner of the hospital Dr Varun Bajaj could not be reached for his comments. He didn’t take phone calls and didn’t respond to text messages.(With input from Sunil Verma in Shajapur)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bhopal/old-man-tied-to-hospital-bed-in-madhya-pradesh-hospital-sealed-registration-suspended/story-aY1sVmbheztlBViMwx7afK.html
09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal BJP meets tomorrow to counter Oppn charge on health scam, reach consensus on state unit chief||The Himachal Pradesh BJP legistlature party will meet in Shimla on Wednesday to decide on the successor of Rajeev Bindal, who resigned as state unit chief after his name surfaced in the health department scam recently.Convened by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, the meeting at the government-run Peterhoff Hotel will chalk out the government and party’s strategy to neutralise opposition Congress’s escalating attack in the scam.Thakur, who heads the legislature party, also holds the health portfolio.The department came under a cloud last month when the then director, health services, Dr Ajay Kumar Gupta was caught on audio tape demanding a bribe of Rs 5 lakh from Prithvi Singh, the representative of a supplier of personal protective equipment (PPE) for the state’s corona frontline workers. The scam led to state BJP chief Rajeev Bindal stepping down on moral grounds due to his proximity with Dr Gupta and to ensure a fair probe.CONGRESS SHARPENS ATTACKThe development gave the opposition Congress a tool to hit out at the ruling party and demand a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) that too at a time when then state government is grappling to contain the spread of coronavirus.“State BJP president Rajeev Bindal resigned after Dr Gupta’s arrest in the health scam. Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur, who is at the helm, should have quit before Bindal. The government should clarify on the circumstances that led to Bindal’s quitting,” said leader of opposition Mukesh Agnihotri.After attending the party’s virtual rally at the state BJP office, Deep Kamal, members of the legislature party are expected to come up with a consensus candidate to take over as state Bharatiya Janata Party chief.Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and the chief minister will address BJP workers virtually amid the Covid-19 pandemic.State BJP chief spokesman Randhir Sharma, the chief minister’s political adviser and party general secretary Trilok Jamwal, Sundernagar legislator Rakesh Jamwal, Kangra Co-operative Bank chairman Rajeev Bhardwaj and party general secretary Ram Singh are frontrunners for the post.TWO CABINET BERTHS VACANTThe party is expected to discuss the cabinet expansion since two berths are vacant after food minister Kishan Kapoor was elected to the Lok Sabha and power minister Anil Sharma quit before last year’s parliamentary elections. The Congress had allotted the party ticket to his son Asheray Sharma from Mandi.The names of Nurpur legislator Rakesh Pathania and Paonta Sahib MLA Sukhram Chaudhary are doing the rounds for inclusion in the cabinet.Intra-party squabbles have also become a cause of concern for the ruling party with supporters of former chief minister Prem Kumar Dhumal stepping up activities in the politically sensitive Kangra district. Former irrigation and public health minister Ravinder Singh Ravi, Kangra Lok Sabha member Kishan Kapoor, former legislator Sanay Chaudhary and party leaders Ranvir Singh Nikka, Nirmal Singh, and Ghanshyam Sharma held closed-door meetings in Dharamshala recently much to the discomfort of Jai Ram Thakur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-bjp-meets-tomorrow-to-counter-oppn-charge-on-health-scam-reach-consensus-on-state-unit-chief/story-gCl405bhh6rNDifzusGpBI.html

An official statement by the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) had on Sunday said 208 migrant workers of Jharkhand would be airlifted from Leh in four batches this week. “Doosra jatha hawai marg se Ranchi pahunch gaya, un sab ko Johar (the second batch has reached Ranchi by air, salutations to them),” a CMO release quoted Soren as having said. According to the state government norms, all 55 migrant workers will have to undergo home quarantine for 14 days. The first batch of 60 migrant workers reached Ranchi from Leh via Delhi on May 29. The returnees, all residents of the state’s Santhal Pargana region, were sent home in sanitised buses. Soren had earlier thanked Ladakh Deputy Commissioner, officials of the Border Road Organisation, low-cost carriers Spice Jet, Indigo, Air Asia, and some local non-governmental organisations for their collective effort in sending the migrant workers home to Jharkhand from Leh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/55-migrant-workers-fly-home-to-jharkhand-from-leh/story-eYaxAzT8bxUvAvQSD69ccI.html

The state government is always ready to cooperate with the Defence Ministry,” the statement quoted the chief minister as saying.Thousands of workers from the Santhal Pargana region of the state have been going to Leh-Ladakh since 1970s for construction works, particularly roads on difficult terrains and peaks, it said.The workers, “through the local networkers of the BRO” go in two batches every year --in April/May and return in September and another goes in October/November and return in February, the statement said. “But this time the migrant workers were stranded due to the lockdown and they approached the call centres (set up by Jharkhand) and CMO,” following which the state government took initiatives to bring them back.The second batch of 55 migrants reached on Monday morning and three more batches are scheduled to fly back this week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/migrants-to-get-20-per-cent-wage-hike-other-benefits-after-jharkhand-bro-agreement/story-QPpFgEem5XOzB98fwRfX4J.html
09-06-2020||Kolkata||West Bengal’s Covid-19 deaths cross 400-mark but fatality rate improves||Even as West Bengal’s death toll due to coronavirus disease Covid-19 has crossed the 400-mark, its fatality rate has improved.With nine more deaths reported on Monday, the state’s death count now stands at 405, according to the state health department bulletin released on Monday night. Of the 405 deaths, 266 or 65.6% had co-morbid conditions.The last time the state had given data for comorbidity in the deaths of Covid-19 patients was on April 30, when the state attributed 72 of the 105 deaths, or 68.5%, to comorbidity.The fatality rate due to Covid-19 in the state has, however, significantly improved. On April 30, the state’s death rate stood at 10.19%, with 105 deaths among 1,030 Covid-19 positive patients. As on June 8, the state’s death rate stood at 4.7%, with 405 deaths among the total 8,613 persons testing positive for the coronavirus infection.This, however, is still higher than the national average. India’s fatality rate stood at 2.8% as of Monday morning, with 7,200 deaths reported against 256,611 persons testing positive for the disease.Only four states have recorded more deaths than Bengal, as of June 8 -- Maharashtra (3169), Gujarat (1,280), Delhi (874) and Madhya Pradesh (414). While Maharashtra has a mortality rate of 3.57% and Delhi has it as 2.91%, Madhya Pradesh’s mortality rate due to Covid-19 is at 4.29% and Gujarat at 6.22%. Among the districts, Kolkata reported a much higher fatality rate at 9% – nearly double Bengal’s average. The capital city accounted for 260 deaths against 2,886 persons testing positive. Kolkata and its neighbouring districts of Howrah and North 24-Parganas have long been the epicentre of the Covid-19 outbreak in Bengal, until a couple of weeks ago when migrant workers returning to the rural districts started testing positive in their dozens. “The death rate is low in the districts, first because most of the cases are new ones and secondly because most of the migrant workers are asymptomatic patients. In Kolkata, symptomatic patients made a large majority,” said a health department official while explaining Kolkata’s high death rate.Government officials also said a higher percentage of deaths in private Covid-19 hospitals has been noticed and it has been decided that a ‘death audit committee’ will look into such cases.As per the health department data, death rate has been lower among men, at 4.48%, whereas for women it stood at 5.4%. There is also a huge gap in death rate between the age groups of 1-45 years and above 45 years.The death rate is lowest among 16-30 age groups – at .17%. It is also low in the 1-16 age group at .69% and at 1.67% for the 30-45 age group. However, the rate is very high at 21.07% for those aged above 75. It stands at 15.39% for the age group of 60-75 and at 7.03% for the 40-60 age group..Bengal’s discharge rate stood at 40.2%, with 3,465 persons discharged from hospitals following recovery.Meanwhile, the West Bengal government on Monday extended lockdown restrictions in containment zones till June 30 in line with the Union home ministry’s guidelines. The restrictions were earlier in force till June 15.However, there would be certain relaxations outside the containment zones, where only essential services are allowed. A government order on extending lockdown said 25 people can attend marriages, funerals and places of worship at a time. The number was previously fixed at 10.“Norms of physical distancing and health hygiene protocol must be strictly followed. Any violation in compliance of norms of physical distancing, health hygiene protocol and wearing of masks shall attract penal action as per law,” the Bengal government order said.“It is reiterated that movement of individuals shall remain prohibited between 9 pm to 5am, except for essential activities. District administration and local authorities shall issue appropriate orders in this regard and ensure strict compliance,” the order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/west-bengal-s-covid-19-deaths-cross-400-mark-but-fatality-rate-improves/story-81xdMEW1pmkCdi62gDbs6I.html

09-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt’s decisions on Covid-19 were legally untenable: Opposition||The opposition parties on Monday welcomed lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal’s decision to overrule the state government’s order reserving hospital beds in the national capital exclusively for Delhi residents and stopping the testing of asymptomatic contacts of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients.Both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress said the government’s order was “legally untenable”. They said it was just a diversionary tactic by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to shift focus from his government’s alleged failure to augment healthcare infrastructure. The Aam Aadmi Party hit back, accusing the BJP of playing dirty politics and putting pressure on the L-G to pass such an order.Welcoming the L-G’s decision, BJP MP from New Delhi Meenakshi Lekhi said, “India is a union of states. The Delhi government’s order was legally untenable, as it was in violation of Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution. How can any state deny a person from another state access to medical care?”The Congress, which ran the city government for 15 years before AAP wrested power from it in 2014, said the government reserved the beds knowing fully well that the decision had no firm legal footing. Former Delhi MP Ajay Maken said, “The Delhi high court in 2018 had ruled against the government’s decision to reserve a certain number of beds in GTB hospital for Delhi residents only. Kejriwal can’t be oblivious to it. This was just an attempt to divert people’s attention from his government’s failure to augment the medical facility.” Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the decision to stop testing of asymptomatic contacts of Covid-19 patients was against the Centre’s guidelines. “Testing is crucial right now to prevent the spread of the disease. But this government is arbitrarily taking decisions and putting people’s lives at risk,” he said. Lekhi came down heavily on AAP on the issue of discrepancy in data about hospital beds, according to the Delhi Corona app, launched by the Delhi government itself. She said the five Ts (testing, tracing, treatment, teamwork and tracking) that Kejriwal said were essential for fighting Covid-19 are missing today.“Is this the time to mislead people? These are human lives; they are not some lab rats or insects on which you can conduct experiments,” the national BJP spokesperson said.The Delhi government had recently ordered that 20% of the total bed strength in private hospitals be reserved for Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-s-decisions-on-covid-19-were-legally-untenable-opposition/story-Ow4sEusBDMl7L14B0GqHSO.html
09-06-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Sweet sorrows in the times of corona||There is nothing exceptional about the sunrise views during these lockdown days. And yet, he is seeing them with new eyes. And perhaps also with a pang in the heart.Because the one who would care for sunrises “and other little things of life” is no longer by his side—for the time.“She is in Delhi, I’m here in Gurugram,” says Tarun Tahiliani from the isolation of his two-room home in Sector 23. He is chatting on WhatsApp video, the pictures are taken through the phone screen that connects him to this reporter.In the BC (Before Corona) era, when it wasn’t risky at all to move through the city, and as risk-free and casual to cross through the Gurugram-Delhi border, Mr Tahiliani would often meet his friend, who lives in Delhi. In his early 30s, he works in a travel company, and she too has a day job, he says.Over the seasons, the two friends have had their share of conflicts. “We have some fundamental differences in approach to life,” Mr Tahiliani notes amiably. “I have an easy-going attitude, while she reacts passionately to every big and small thing that comes her way.”To her, for instance, the morning means the shades of sunrise, and a propensity to gaze upon the freshness of flowers. To him, the morning means getting up, rustling out the breakfast and dressing up for office.These past few weeks when it was impossible to meet her in person, due to the lockdown caused by the pandemic, all he wanted was to be close to her, somehow. He says he would see her in his heart’s eyes, fiddling around in his empty apartment. “She would be looking into the mirror, getting ready for the day ahead... while I would be in the kitchen, pouring naariyal paani (coconut water) into her favourite pink-coloured glass.”Illusions apart, the fact is she isn’t here. We are amid a raging pandemic that is refusing to slow down. And though now one might move about with the lifting of lockdown, the danger of catching the infection stays.So, in order to have something of her tangible self in his immediate world, Mr Tahiliani has been trying to do the very things he never really cared for but which he knows she cares about. “I’m now more attentive to the sunrise.” Which certainly is easy these days because now, like so many others, he has been working from home and doesn’t have to face a hectic morning filled up with anxieties about the office commute.He has also started to carry out daily rituals that, he knows, she must be following in her Delhi residence. “I’m regularly watering the plants in the porch, I have kept water vessels outside for the thirsty birds, and when I go out to get groceries, I try to feed the area’s stray dogs.”It’s been more than two months since the two friends were together—their last meeting was the day before the Prime Minister imposed the junta curfew on 22 March. “We parted on 21.03.” This is the date that has all the three numbers—1,2, and 3—they think belong to the secret world of their friendship. “We both find anything with these numbers occurring in any permutation or combination as a good omen.”Stranded alone in his small house for so many days, Mr Tahiliani says he is realising afresh the importance of an embrace from a loved one. “Everything will be fine, once I hug her again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-sweet-sorrows-in-the-times-of-corona/story-CmSC0eRA6OVcmXRRjENnDO.html
09-06-2020||Mumbai||Researchers in India find evidence of Covid-19 genes in sewage||In what may be first evidence from India of the presence of the Sars-Cov-2 virus in sewage, the Indian Institute of Technology-Gandhinagar (IIT-Gn) has found non-infectious genes of the coronavirus in wastewater samples collected from untreated sewage in an outlet in Ahmedabad. Researchers said their finding highlights the need to introduce wastewater-based surveillance across the country to detect, monitor and control the spread of Covid-19 as well as identify potential hotspots before clinical diagnosis. Till date, Australia, Netherlands, France and United States have reported molecular detection of the Sars-Cov-2 virus in wastewater in scientific literature. In April, IIT-Gn joined a global consortium of 51 premier universities and research institutes to undertake surveillance of sewage water to help determine and quantify excretion of the Sars-Cov-2 virus, in an effort to build an early warning system for Covid-19.“Wastewater is an important source to monitor the presence and progress of the infection because the virus leaves the body of not only those who are symptomatic but also asymptomatic individuals through excretion,” said IIT-Gn professor Manish Kumar, who is leading the ongoing investigation. “Our result, which is in all likelihood the first from India, explicitly illustrates the variation of Sars-Cov-2 gene during the lockdown period, ie May 8 and May 27. Our finding effectively substantiates the ability of wastewater surveillance to enormously supplement testing individuals who are infected or incubating that virus which causes Covid-19.” Kumar will send the first set of findings of to an international scientific journal for peer review by the end of this week.  Also Watch | Covid ‘situation worsening’, says WHO as global cases cross 70 lakh-markStudies have shown Sars-Cov-2 is not infectious in wastewater. Additionally, temperature is an important environmental factor affecting the virus’s survival in water. For the analysis, Gujarat Pollution Control Board (GPCB) assisted the IIT-Gn team collect wastewater samples on May 8 and May 27, and each 100 millilitre sample was concentrated several times to extract genetic material for RTPCR, a technique that amplifies a targeted fragment of gene. “We extracted virus RNA [ribonucleic acid], amplified the dead genetic material and found all samples deterministically showed the presence of the three genes [ORF1ab, S and N genes] of the coronavirus,” said Kumar.The team, which includes post-doctoral fellow Arbind Kumar Patel, also found a clear effect of increase in Covid-19 patients in Civil Hospital, Ahmedabad, on the results of RTPCR. “The temporal difference in the results from the samples collected on the two days and tested with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction are so explicit that WBE surveillance must be implemented in every city with analytical capabilities,” said Kumar.Wastewater-based epidemiology has been used in the developing world, including India, to monitor spread of rotavirus that causes polio, as well as globally to trace the presence illicit drugs. “Similarly, testing waste or sewage water that contains the excreta of 1,000 or 10,000 people for the presence of novel coronavirus, even if non-viable, will indicate if the health of the entire local community is good or deteriorating, and not just that of an individual,” said Kumar. “Since testing everyone is not feasible for our country with its huge population and the virus is going to be around for a long time, the government must include wastewater-based epidemiology surveillance for better understanding of the curve of the pandemic,” he said. With testing protocol modified and ascertained by combined team of Gujarat Biotechnology Research Centre (GBRC) and IIT-Gn, results of wastewater samples can be out within a day and therefore, tests may be undertaken every day. The researchers said in cities like Mumbai and Delhi, monitoring sewage treatment plants daily may give the government a lead time before the infection peaks in a community.Rakesh Kumar, director, CSIR-National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute, said wastewater-based surveillance is a complex process in India where the situation can change quickly and consequently, the virus load would also greatly vary. “This method will also require massive amounts of sampling. Looking at the volume of water in India, it will be a much more difficult task, and therefore it has its own challenges to use this as a surveillance tool in Indian conditions,” he said. “Source-based interventions are need of the hour and may provide a possible robust way to address the way.” Chaitanya G Joshi, director of GBRC, said, “It was very difficult to analyse the genes from the wastewater samples. However, we are happy with the outcome which has great societal importance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/scientists-find-evidence-of-covid-19-genetic-material-in-ahmedabad-sewage/story-p8Gs9I1hQPxshtTnPNylHJ.html
09-06-2020||Mumbai||Not enough public space in Mumbai to follow social distancing||As the lockdown eases in Mumbai after 70 days, green areas and public spaces have seen overcrowding, offering a grim reminder that the city has precious little open space. According to Development Plan (DP) 2034, just 3% — or 15.37 square kilometres (sqkm) — of Mumbai comprises open space. With a total area of 458.28 sqkm and a population of 12 million people, this means 1.24 square metres (sqm) of accessible open space for each person in the city. A recent paper by Sayli Udas Mankikar of Observer Research Foundation (ORF) placed Mumbai just ahead of Chennai (0.81 sqm per capita), but far below Delhi (21.52 sqm per capita) and Bengaluru (17.32 sqm per capita). Mumbai also fared poorly in international comparisons — New York City has 26.4 sqm per capita while London has 31.68 sqm per capita. Pankaj Joshi, executive director, Urban Design Research Institute, said the recommended per person open space requirement is 10-12 sqm. “Lack of open spaces in Mumbai is a long-term problem which is now staring at us. In such a situation, citizens must exercise self-regulation,” Joshi said.Photographs of crowded public areas, like Marine Drive, have raised concerns of accelerating the spread of Covid-19. Mankikar said residential societies can identify community spaces in and around their premises as alternatives. “A building’s terrace or a green space near a building, community halls can be looked at by citizens who have the option.

The pandemonium forced the principal judge to leave his chamber and pacify the lawyers and assure them that no adverse order would be passed in case they miss the hearing.According to the lawyers who went to attend the hearing, there was confusion owing to restricted entries, even for the lawyers. Only those lawyers who had their cases listed were allowed inside the court. Ever since the lockdown was announced, security checking has been made strict for lawyers since the lockdown was announced in March.“The chaos began after 11am, as many lawyers turned up in the court. The security staff allowed only those who had their cases listed, while the rest were not permitted. This caused delay and chaos in the court premises,” criminal lawyer Anjali Patil said.Considering the situation, noted criminal lawyer Sudeep Pasbola, who represents Sheena Bora murder accused Indrani, wrote to principal judge over the chaos, calling for better management at the premises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/restricted-entry-for-lawyers-at-sessions-court-in-mumbai-leads-to-chaos/story-DpoP62oIR5U0gCTH2wG2jI.html
09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Panjab University changes question paper pattern for 2020||The examination branch of the Panjab University on Monday issued guidelines that in view of the pandemic, a new question paper pattern had been framed for the upcoming final semester examinations in July.The new guidelines that will supersede the existing ones state that students will not have to attempt questions on a unit basis and the duration of the examination will be two hours. All questions will carry equal marks and the questions will cover all syllabus. This year, the students of BA, BSc, BCom, BBA, BCA and all other undergraduate and honors courses will have to attempt only four questions including the compulsory ones. In the previous paper pattern, students had to attempt all questions.The students of all professional courses that include MBA, engineering, law, hotel management, science, pharmacy, and those in postgraduate courses will have to attempt any four questions including the compulsory ones. However, for Hindi elective (BA), any three questions out of the first four questions are to be attempted.Chairperson of physics department professor Navdeep Goyal said, “This will make question papers easy to attempt for the students. The pattern has been simplified and now students can attempt any four questions in the question paper.”EXAMINATION OF EXIT CLASSES IN FIRST PHASEDean of university instructions (DUI) RK Singla said, “For the conduct of examinations, a plan for minimum movement of students is being worked out. The semester examinations for the exit classes (UG and PG) will be conducted in the first phase, after the reassessment of situation by the authorities. Reasonable and sufficient notice of examination will be given to the candidates.”The PU-CET (PG) entrance test will be conducted on July 27 and 28 this year.MORE CHOICE TO STUDENTSPU controller of examinations Parvinder Singh said, “The pattern of paper has been changed so as to give a wider choice to the students, keeping in mind that full syllabus was not covered.”President, NSUI, Nikhil Narmeta said, “Finally the university has released guidelines without mentioning when the exams for terminal students are to be held. They must not include the entire syllabus for the exam as not many students were able to access online classes and our demand still remains the same: conducting exams in this crisis is not possible so promote all students.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/panjab-university-changes-question-paper-pattern-for-2020/story-K1upAQwNPLf3dUefU7PHfL.html
09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Soon, doctor’s consent will be necessary for physical consultation at PGIMER||Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research is planning to make prior consent by doctors through tele-consultation necessary for physical consultation in the outpatient departments (OPD).After the institute shut down OPDs post the coronavirus pandemic, the institute had launched tele-consultation services for patients seeking advice.PGIMER spokesperson Dr Ashok Kumar said that the institute’s new OPD model could be an example for other hospitals to follow.On Monday alone, PGIMER received close to 800 calls for tele-consultations services and those requiring more medical attention were given slots for physical examination. “The service has picked up. The number of people calling for our services is gradually increasing. We are working on making it a permanent process for the future,” Dr Kumar said.Dr GD Puri, dean, academics, said the tele-consultation service was a hassle-free approach for a tertiary care institute like PGIMER. “It is beneficial for patients as well as doctors. A patient does not need to be present here and will be called only if there is a need for a physical examination,” he said.He added that patients with referrals from the other hospitals will not need to go through this process. However, struggling with the huge rush of patients at the emergency ward, PGIMER has asked hospitals under the jurisdiction of Chandigarh health department to seek consent before referring patients to the institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/soon-doctor-s-consent-will-be-necessary-for-physical-consultation-at-pgimer/story-i754A4LHlwyhBVjbUmYKPJ.html

As a precautionary measure, more than 20 personnel, including the additional commissioner of police (crime branch), have been home quarantined. “All those who have been tested positive are asymptomatic are admitted to hospital. Their condition is fine,” a senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, who did not wish to be named.The police has said that contact tracing in this case is difficult, as the personnel had been on bandobast duty for Shramik trains and came across thousands of people. Till Monday evening, the total number of active cases in Mumbai Police stands at 1,035, even as 813 personnel have already been recovered. For the first time since the lockdown was imposed, the active cases in Mumbai Police came down by 79 from the 1,774 cases reported on Saturday.

He had been posted at Bhiwandi station, and may have developed the infection due to the Shramik train rush. On May 27, the personnel fell ill and his test report came positive on May 29. He was rushed to the hospital the same day and he was put on ventilator soon after being admitted,” said, Satish Pawar, senior police inspector of Dombivli GRP.“Even though those policemen who are aged above 55 years can choose to stay home, the ASI reported to work of his own wish, so we allowed him to work,” said Ravindra Sengaokar, Mumbai GRP commissioner. 19 booked, 9 arrested for lockdown violationsThe Mumbai Police on Sunday registered 11 first information reports (FIRs) against 19 people and arrested nine accused for lockdown violations. Four FIRs each have been filed against those gathering in public and not wearing masks. The remaining three are against shops for operating without permission.

09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Places of worship open to tentative response in Punjab, caution dominant sentiment||Amritsar/Ludhiana Gathering at places of worship resumed, but with a tentative touch, in the state on Monday. At the Golden Temple, Amritsar, which had remained open even during the lockdown, following all mandated precautions, the footfall was not as per expectation, said an official of the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC), on the condition of anonymity. The serving of ‘karah parsad’ and langar continued, defying government guidelines, with administrative officials evasive on the issue. Though no official count was kept, sources said around 30% of the normal footfall of around 1 lakh a day was witnessed during the day. Sukhbir Singh, manager of Golden Temple’s langar ghar, said the number of devotees was nearly double the figure seen during the lockdown. “During lockdown, there were two-three rows of devotees partaking of langar in the community kitchen. Today, up to five rows were filled at times,” he said, adding, “People are not coming out of homes due to covid-19.” At Durgiana Temple, the footfall remained low. “The number is disappointing. We expected more,” said temple committee president Ramesh Sharma. Here too, parsad and langar was served in defiance of guidelines, with authorities claiming to follow extreme precaution. Token system, distancing followed in Ludhiana In place of ‘parsad’ and holy water (‘charanamrit’), priests were armed with sanitisers and infrared thermometers and blessed devotees from a distance in Ludhiana. At the majority of places, the sanctum sanctorum was locked to prevent people from touching idols or sacred books. Circles were marked at Jama Masjid in Field Gunj to ensure social distancing. Shahi Imam Maulana Habib Ur Rehman Sani Ludhianvi said, “We have to maintain distancing today, so that we can embrace each other tomorrow.”‘Karah parsad’ continued to be served in gurdwaras across the city. President of Dukh Niwaran Gurdwara near Jagraon Bridge in Field Gunj, Pritpal Singh Pali said, “We are following government guidelines, while maintaining the rehat maryada (religious code of conduct) of the Sikh faith. There is minimal human contact involved in preparing ‘karah parsad’. Those distributing ‘parsad’ are also wearing mask and gloves and using a ladle to serve.” The management of Shri Durga Mata Mandir near Jagraon Bridge has introduced token system to limit entry to 20 devotees at a time. Sanjay Mahindru, general secretary of the temple trust, said, at least 250 devotees visited the temple on Monday. On a normal day, the number goes up to 5,000 and 15,000 on Tuesdays. Most devotees bowed their heads on the main gates instead of going inside temples. Pouring of water or milk on ‘Shivlings’ was prohibited. Shri Nav Durga Mandir, Sarabha Nagar, saw only seven devotees from 6am to 8am. Devotees were not allowed to bring ‘parsad’, flowers and milk from outside, and entered empty-handed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/places-of-worship-open-to-tentative-response-in-punjab-caution-dominant-sentiment/story-e6f7MvO4EZLkEV2nDBPUGO.html
09-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s Covid-19 hotspots, Worli, Dharavi now see decline in new cases||Worli and Dharavi, which emerged as the two major Covid-19 hotspots of the city in the beginning of the outbreak, are now witnessing a decline in the number of average daily cases and surge in doubling rate, giving hope to authorities. Worli reported an average of 60 cases in May, which has come down to 35-40 in June. In Dharavi, the average new cases have come down from 47 in May to 27 in June. The growth rates of Worli and Dharavi has come down to 1.9% and 1.7%, respectively, which are among the lowest in the city. The doubling rate of Dharavi has gone up to 44 days, while it takes 38 days for cases to double in Worli. The two areas have also reported a recovery rate of 50%. Kiran Dighavkar, assistant municipal commissioner of G North ward, that covers Dharavi, said, “We have separated suspected patients from the community on a timely basis, conducted screenings and aggressive testing and organised fever camps. We have identified people who were using common toilets and home quarantined them also.” Dharavi has reported 1, 924 cases and 71 deaths. On Monday, 12 positive cases were reported in the area.Dighavkar claimed that of the 1,924 cases, around 70% had been already quarantined by the BMC. “I don’t think that there will be a rise in the numbers after this as we are continuously screening more and more people and ensuring isolation of most of the people. We will keep doing that until there are zero cases in Dharavi.”Meanwhile, with 42 cases reported on Monday, the total cases in G south ward, which consists of Worli, has gone up to 2,390. The final death toll figures are yet to be updated. Initially, Worli was among the worst-hit areas in the city, with cases escalating speedily on a daily basis. Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner of G South ward, said, “Densely-populated slums such as Jijamata Nagar and Worli-Koliwada had the maximum cases being reported every day, but as of today, these slums have nil or minimal cases. We only focused not only on recovery but also on prevention.” BMC claims to have screened 87, 000 people in Worli and put 4, 500 residents in institutional quarantine. Ughade also attributed the decline in cases to people’s participation. Dr Om Srivastav, one of the doctors who are a part of the task force appointed by the state to bring down the mortality rate, said, “We will have to wait and see what kind of numbers come in the next two or three weeks. If residents continue to follow what they have been doing in the past eight weeks, such as wearing masks, sanitising hands and following social distancing norms, then we should be able to manage to flatten the curve.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/earlier-mumbai-s-covid-19-hotspots-worli-and-dharavi-s-cases-now-see-fall/story-BUKNcHQPwxyVmAhcpD4H1O.html
09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Take prior permission before initiating any fresh project: UT admn tells Chandigarh MC||The municipal corporation will now have to take prior approval of the UT administration before undertaking any new development work in the city.The condition was laid down by the administration on Monday while approving MC’s revised estimates for 2019-20 and the budget estimates for 2020-2021.A total of ₹67 crore have been made available to the MC for carrying out capital or new development works in the city for the current financial year. In the budget approval letter to the MC, the administration directed, “₹67 crore are expected to be available with the MC for development works, so MC should identify capital/revenue works to this extent only and submit the details of such projects before actually undertaking any.”“Many of the development works are going to suffer because of paucity of funds this year. No new project is likely to be started. Works like changing of the defunct storm and sewerage lines, and even works under the ward development funds are likely to be adversely impacted this year,” said a senior MC official requesting anonymity.‘SET PRIORITIES’The MC has also been directed to prioritise new development works and plan accordingly the spending of ₹67 crore available for them. Capital works already started in the earlier years need to be given priority for completion in this financial year before undertaking any other capital work, the administration has further directed.The new administration order, however, will have no impact on road re-carpeting work in the city. “Road re-carpeting will be made possible because of a special grant that the UT had issued in March. Work on last year’s pending road re-carpeting project has started. This financial year’s road re-carpeting work will start after monsoon,” said the official.In March this year, the UT administration had approved a special grant of ₹132 crore for the MC to help complete its pending projects, including broken roads.‘GENERATE MORE INTERNAL FUNDS’Even as the lockdown has aggravated the financial difficulties of an already cash-starved MC, the administration has asked the civic body to “improve the resource generation at its own level by adopting various measures.”“The corporation is in no position to make funds available for capital works planned for this fiscal. Our internal resources have depleted due to the lockdown,” said the official.NO 20% CUT IN MC SPENDINGThe UT administration has decided against levying a 20% cut in the committed grant for the MC in the first quarter. The central government had asked all departments to cutback on their first quarter spending by 20% in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. The administration has said it will instead absorb the 20% cut at its own level and ensure the MC gets 100% grant approved by the Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/take-prior-permission-before-initiating-any-fresh-project-ut-admn-tells-chandigarh-mc/story-oahpm8HbL0KcttAtz36PFP.html
09-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai’s coronavirus cases cross 50,000-mark; toll touches 1,702||The city on Monday crossed the grim milestone of 50,000 Covid-19 cases, and even reported the highest number of deaths (64) recorded in a single day so far. With 1,311 new cases, the count has gone up to 50,085 and the toll is 1,702. The number of cases is likely to see a surge in the coming week, as the city partially opened up in a three-phased plan that concluded on Monday. Of the 50,085, 26,345 or 52.6% of the cases are active. Of the 64 deaths, 43 patients had co-morbidities. Forty-four patients were men and 20 women; three deaths were of people below 40 years of age, 38 were above 60 years, and 23 between 40 and 60 years. The city’s mortality rate is 3.39%. It has a recovery rate of 43.9%, as 22,032 people have recovered and have been discharged. The doubling rate – time taken for the number of cases to double – for the city is 23 days. So far, Mumbai has conducted a total of 2,29,899 tests, with a percentage positivity of 21.11.BMC on June 2 issued a circular in tandem with Maharashtra government’s Mission Begin Again plan to kickstart the city and its economy post a 2.5-month-long lockdown. As per this plan, gardens and parks are open for joggers and morning walkers, between 5am and 7am, shops are open with restrictions on timings, private offices are working to 10% of their capacity with the remaining staff working from home, taxis and autoriskshaws are plying essential workers, and BEST bus services have resumed.BMC officials said easing these restrictions will bring more people on the streets, who will interact with each other, and lead to a spike. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani (who is in charge of health) said, “Our recovery rate is close to 50%. Although the number of total Covid-19 cases has crossed 50,000, our recovery rate is equally high.” Regarding the 64 deaths recorded in a single day, Kakani said, “We are analysing the death rate closely. We are strictly following the protocols suggested by the task force to reduce deaths.” Regarding a surge post staggered unlock plan, Kakani said, “We cannot call it surge. The number of cases may rise. We can say next 10 days are crucial for us and we need to analyse the trend carefully now. But we have augmented the bed capacity to handle it.” There are currently 775 containment zones in the city in slums and chawls, and 4,071 buildings have been sealed. The civic body has traced 9,47,424 risk contacts of patients, of which 2,36,068 are high-risk contacts. A total of 28,486 people are in institutional quarantine centres, as risk contacts. Of the risk contacts, 18,765 are suspected to be Covid-19 patients. Om Shrivastav, a senior city-based doctor part of the task force appointed by the Maharashtra government in April to bring down mortality, said, “We will know more in the coming few days. Our health infrastructure is ready. We will have to see what the burden on the public health system will be. We are doing the best we can do in these circumstances.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-s-coronavirus-cases-cross-50-000-mark-toll-touches-1-702/story-mLYGFQ2C24nzdHp0XVXGoK.html

09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Lukewarm response from devotees as places of worship open doors after 2 months in Chandigarh||A lukewarm response was seen from devotees as religious places in the city opened their doors for the first time since the lockdown was imposed on March 24. Manager of the Sector-34 gurdwara, Amarjeet Singh, said, “On normal days, we have around 100 devotees here but on Monday, only around 10 persons turned up. The Gugamari temple in Sector 20 also received only a few regulars for their morning pooja.Kishori Lal, a member of the temple’s management committee, said, “We are expecting more people to come on Tuesday to offer prayers to Lord Hanuman but it’s easier to manage a smaller crowd.”Bishop Ignatius Mascarenhas of the Roman Catholic Church, Shimla and Chandigarh Diocese, said there won’t be any congregations but devotees are welcome to come and offer prayers individually from 7.30am onwards. Maulana Imran, head of the Manimajra mosque, said, “Today, we read the namaz without the ceremonial dari as a safety precaution against the virus. Around 20 devotees had come in to offer prayers.”MANSA DEVI TEMPLE OPENS ON TRIAL BASISThe gates of the Mansa Devi Temple were thrown open on Monday to check the feasibility of online issuance of passes. On Monday, around 400 devotees had registered themselves and till 4pm, around 150 had visited the temple. “The temple will open from Tuesday and around 4,500 persons will be allowed per day.At Nada Sahib gurdwara, all caution was thrown to wind as devotees were seen roaming around without masks and one person was found offering prasad without wearing any gloves.The gurdwara had not been even closed during lockdown. An official from the gurdwara said: “At any given point, there are 10-20 people inside the gurdwara. We keep making announcements, asking people to maintain social distancing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lukewarm-response-from-devotees-as-places-of-worship-open-doors-after-2-months-in-chandigarh/story-3p1W7MeuHiTJbKuRvyLIVP.html
09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Donation has dipped by 90%: Pingwalwara society||All-India Pingalwara Charitable Society (AIPCS), which provides shelter to 1,600-odd destitute and disabled persons in its six branches across Punjab, is struggling to keep up its good work, with donations drying up due to the lockdown, imposed in view of covid-19.Donation, its major source of sustenance, has dropped 90% from the average Rs 3 crore a month it received before the pandemic struck, the society says. Contribution from abroad formed 80% of the donations; this has stopped. “Our society relies totally on donations, which have stopped almost completely. Few people are donating, but the amount is negligible compared to what we need. Earlier, on average we got Rs 3 crore a month,” said Inderjit Kaur, president, AIPCS.She added, “For the past nearly three months, we have using our savings to run the society. With a daily average expense of Rs 6.5 lakh that increases if patients are to be treated, our savings will exhaust soon. We have not laid-off any of the 861 staff and not cut salaries. We, however, have issued an appeal to them to donate from their salaries.” She added that with religious processions not allowed this year, they were not able to collect donations from NRI patrons in Canada, US and England as well. “During religious processions in these countries in 2019, we had collected around $60,000 (around Rs 42 lakh),” she claimed, adding an additional difficulty for the society was the increased cost of treatment in view of covid-19, as they had to provide medical equipment as well.She added local residents continued to support them with wheat and rice, but an appeal to donate on its online portal had not yielded much result. Chief administrator of the society, Col Darshan Singh Bawa said, “Donation from abroad, which was 80% of the total has dried up. Our donation boxes in gurdwaras are empty as there is hardly any footfall.” The society also runs special schools for deaf and dumb children. Its main branch, a three-storey building, is situated near Amritsar bus stand, comprising a female ward, children’s ward, rehabilitation centre, printing press, dispensary, medical lab, dental centre and a common kitchen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/donation-has-dipped-by-90-pingwalwara-society/story-c3yDjzl0Ti6G53uG7UvAJI.html
09-06-2020||Mumbai||Yes Bank case: ED raids 5 premises of Cox and Kings, claims firm defaulted on ₹3,642-crore payment||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) on Monday raided five premises belonging to senior management of global tours and travel company Cox and Kings Group (CKG), in connection with the Yes Bank money laundering probe. The agency has claimed that the firm defaulted on loan payments worth ₹3,642 crore.HT tried to contact CKG for their response over ED’s allegations, but till the time of going to the press, the firm did not respond to calls and messages.On March 8, ED arrested Yes Bank’s founder Rana Kapoor, who is currently in judicial custody. The agency has been scanning the transactions made by the bank to its borrowers.“During investigation, irregularities were also noticed in relation to the loan sanctioned to CKG. The Group had created multiple layer of onshore and offshore subsidiary across the globe through which the monies were siphoned off,” ED said in a statement on Monday afternoon.The travel company was sent to bankruptcy court last year in October, after it defaulted on payments to the bank.“Malvern Travel Limited, UK [United Kingdom] (an entity of CKG) was having outstanding of ₹493 crore which submitted the forged bank statement of RBS [Royal Bank of Scotland] Bank, UK; State Bank of India, UK, and forged end-use certificates of BDO LLP ( statuary auditor of the UK-based entity) to avail the said loan from Yes Bank. This forgery was pointed out by KPMG which is the administrator of this UK-based entity,” the statement added.The agency has alleged falsification of records. “In relation to Cox & Kings Limited (CKL), the company forged its consolidated financials by forging the balance sheets of the overseas subsidiaries. The same was informed to BSE [Bombay Stock Exchange]/NSE [National Stock Exchange] by the resolution professional in writing. The statutory auditor of the Prometheon Enterprise Limited, UK (PEL – a subsidiary of CKG) was Raffingers UK LLP and the financials of PEL were sent to India by fictitious domain name impersonating the current officials of Raffingers UK LLP. For this, Raffingers UK LLP filed a criminal complaint to the National Crime Agency, UK,” it added.After CKL’s default came into light, the lenders appointed PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) for forensic audit but the accused firm’s management did not cooperate, the ED alleged. However, based on the limited data available with them, PWC – which conducted the audit – confirmed the falsification of accounts, overstating of the sales figures and understating of the debt figures and fictitious transactions. PWC reported that from financial year 2015 to 2019, ₹3,908 crore were made to 15 fictitious customers, ED stated.“Majority of collection shown in ledgers from Ezeego (another group entity) was not found in the bank statements. Another 147 sets of customers are also suspicious and not existent, as per PWC report. As per the report, CKL diverted ₹1,100 crore to Alok Industries Ltd without any approval of board,” ED’s statement said.According to the agency, CKG sold Holiday Break Education Limited (HBEL), UK, a subsidiary of CKG, for ₹4,387 crore and instead of discharging the liability of bank, the entity siphoned off majority of the money, from which US$15.34 million was transferred to Kuber Investment Mauritius Pvt Ltd, which was controlled by one of the members of the senior management, whose premise was raided by ED on Monday.From Ezeego, ₹150 crore were diverted to Redkite Capital Private Limited which was promoted by two other members of the management. This fund diverted to Redkite was used to buy the controlling stake in Tourism Finance Corporation Of India Ltd, a listed non-banking financial company (NBFC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-case-ed-raids-5-premises-of-cox-and-kings-claims-firm-defaulted-on-3-642-crore-payment/story-Rsm9vrIqIGtCI2dZtawE9N.html

While cinemas and gaming areas remained closed, eateries opened only for take-away as dine-in has not been allowed by the government. With heavy security at entry points of malls for screening visitors, passes were also being issued at the entry of a few malls for restricting gatherings inside the malls. Visitors were not being allowed to enter the malls till they downloaded the COVA application in their mobile phones.At the Pavilion Mall, the security staff had kept 150 passes out of which only 97 were issued by afternoon. Similarly, passes were also being issued at the entry of the MBD Mall to keep a check on the number of visitors entering the mall at a given time.While a few stores were still closed in the malls on the Ferozepur Road, the staff members of other stores said that the situation would come to be normal in the coming days. They said they were already expecting low response on the first day as operations were also allowed till 7pm only.Gaurav, a staff member of a clothing store in the Wave Mall, said, “We were expecting low response on the first day. But, customers kept on trickling in till the last moment. Business is not the same as the buying capacity of people has also reduced. We are following all the guidelines issued by the government and hope that everything will come to normal soon.”A visitor to the MBD Neopolis Mall, Gurdeep Singh, said, “My wife wears clothes of a particular brand and we were waiting for the malls to open . However, things have changed and we also restricted any unnecessary movement in the mall.”Meanwhile, deputy commissioner of police (DCP-headquarters) Akhil Chaudhary also conducted a meeting with representatives of various malls in the city and directed them to follow all the guidelines issued by the government.MBD NEOPOLIS MALL SECURITY STAFF STAGE PROTESTExpressing resentment over their salaries not paid for the past three months (March, April, May), the outsourced security staff of the MBD Neopolis Mall staged a protest around 8 am on Monday.A security guard, requesting anonymity, alleged that there are around 70 security guards working in the mall and they have not been paid salary for the last three months. The outsourcing contractor rued that he has not been paid by the mall management, due to which he has not been able to pay salaries to staff. The protest was lifted around 10 am after getting the assurance that the salaries would be credited in their accounts soon.The mall authorities, however, claimed that it was an internal matter of the outsourcing company and the mall management has nothing to do with it as the security staff has been outsourced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/malls-in-ludhiana-get-tepid-response-on-first-day-cinemas-gaming-areas-remain-closed/story-yVSU26ZDc9u5sMT1oZntyM.html
09-06-2020||Mumbai||2 days after suspected gas leak, no source detected||Two days after suspected gas leak complaints were received by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) said it has not been able to find the source of the suspected leak. The MFB is also considering taking help from the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) for the same. It was earlier suspected that the leak was from a private factory in Govandi, however, MFB said that it could not establish the source. The Congress party has demanded a proper investigation into the incident, considering it was reported for the second time in less than a year.BMC’s disaster management control room, on Saturday night, received over nine complaints from residents of Chembur, Mankhurd, Ghatkopar (East), Ghatkopar (West), Powai, Andheri, Kanjurmarg and Vikhroli about a foul pungent odour, giving rise to the suspicions of a gas leak. However, no source for the same is established yet.P Rahangdale, chief fire officer of MFB said, “The suspicion of a leak from a private factory in Govandi is ruled out as we have not found any source. Also, we have not been able to find the source of the gas leak, for which complaints were received.”Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of Opposition in the BMC said, “There should be a proper investigation on the gas leak complaints considering such complaints were received for the second time in less than one year. Also, there should be a dedicated team in the BMC to detect gas leaks.”Earlier, a similar gas leak complaint was filed in September 2019, however, the source of the gas leak was detected. The BMC’s disaster management department had received around 37 complaints from over 15 locations, followed by over 50 complaints by MFB and few complaints by the Mumbai Police. Post the incident, the BMC had set up a committee to identify the source of the smell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/2-days-after-suspected-gas-leak-no-source-detected/story-8NHQPKkHee85l3U7PuhIkK.html
09-06-2020||Chandigarh||Dine-ins off to slow start in Chandigarh||Cautious residents sticked to takeaways and home deliveries even as several restaurants in Chandigarh resumed dine-in services from Monday, following the administration’s nod. Pal Dhaba in Sector 28, which normally sees a huge rush, saw virtually no dine-in customers today. Eatery owner, Amit Pal Singh, said, “The number of takeaway orders and home delivery requests were far more than dine-in customers. I suspect this is because people are still wary of stepping out.” Sindhi Sweets proprietor Neeraj Bajaj, too, saw a lukewarm response. “I have outlets in Sectors 8, 17, 33 and 32. We received the best response in Sector 17, but there is still a long way to go,” he said.The eateries in Sector 10, meanwhile, received a comparatively better response. Jannat Chadha, proprietor of Cafe JC’s, said that they had a promising start and their restaurant is now equipped with safety screen guards to ensure social distancing.Hotels too got off to a slow start. Proprietor of Hotel Aroma in Sector 22, Manmohan Singh Kohli said that they didn’t expect the sales to be very high on the first day. “The important thing was to get started. We are hoping the sales will improve by this weekend.”Meanwhile at Elante, movie theatres and restaurants remained closed and third floor of the mall wore a deserted look. Though other stores, such as those dealing in clothes, remained open, the mall saw hardly 10% of its normal footfall. The business remained slow too. Manager of the Westside store in the mall, Shah Nawaz, said, “We used to get between 2,000 to 3,000 customers a day but on Monday, we got only around 100 customers.” Store manager of Zara, Pavneet Kaur, said they have started a new policy to allow only 20 inside the store at a time.Meanwhile, the impasse between restaurant owners and the Elante Mall regarding their rent agreements still remains unresolved.In Panchkula, restaurant and hotel owners are still waiting for the administration to issue standard operating procedures (SOPs). “We are yet to receive the SOPs but we plan to resume services by June 11,” said Rohit Sharma, owner of Bisaat restaurant and Chugli cafe in Sector 5, Panchkula. The few restaurants that have already resumed operations also wore a deserted look.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dine-ins-off-to-slow-start-in-chandigarh/story-JSd27t9duAQfXQuAOnZlTP.html
09-06-2020||Mumbai||CM unhappy with banks over crop loan disbursement||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday expressed his displeasure over the approach by the banks on sanctioning crop loans to farmers and said he doesn’t want to listen any more complaints that the farmers are not getting loans from the banks. Thackeray held a meeting with ministers and senior officials from state cooperation, agriculture, food and civil supplies, and others to review preparations for kharif season. A senior official, who attended the meeting, said Thackeray was annoyed to know that nationalised banks disbursed only 7% crop loans to farmers against the target set for this fiscal year.Thackeray told the officials he would also be speaking to the heads of State Bank of India, Punjab National Bank and Bank of Maharashtra for smooth disbursement of crop loans so that farmers won’t have to face hardships.“To provide crop loans to farmers at the earliest, the nationalised banks should communicate orders of the state government to all their branches. I don’t want to listen to any more complaints from farmers that they are not getting crop loans,” Thackeray said in the meeting, according to officials. Thackeray was informed that nationalised banks have disbursed ₹2,300 crore, which comes to 7%, and district central cooperative banks have sanctioned ₹6,250 crore as crop loans, 46% of the target determined for this year. It was found that nationalised banks have refused to sanction loans to over 11.12 lakh farmers who were eligible to get benefit under state-run loan waiver scheme — Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Shetkari Karj Mukti Yojana — but could not get it as the state government is facing financial crisis owing to Covid-19 lockdown and it has expressed its inability to pay amount to the banks at present, said a senior official requesting anonymity. “This is despite the state government order issued on May 22 to provide fresh credit to defaulting farmers who are eligible under the loan waiver scheme, as the state takes guarantee to pay their loan amount with interest against the delay,” he said.The state government needs ₹8,100 crore to write off the debts.The loan waiver scheme promises to write off loans with an outstanding of up to ₹2 lakh for farmers from April 1, 2015 to September 30, 2019. The state has transferred ₹12,000 crore in the bank accounts of over 19 lakh beneficiaries so far, and the other 11.12 lakh beneficiaries are yet to get the benefit.For this fiscal year, the state has set the target for disbursement of crop loan of ₹45,785 crore to farmers. Of these, nationalised banks were expected to sanction ₹32,262 crore and district central cooperative banks were expected to disburse ₹13,524 crore.Thackeray further directed that there should not be any shortage of seeds and warned that those found selling bogus seeds will face strict action.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-unhappy-with-banks-over-crop-loan-disbursement/story-Ons4aoTirryvMVJjv3sXJK.html
09-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga: CM asks state officials to accelerate cyclone mitigation project||In the aftermath of the devastation caused by Cylone Nisarga in the coastal districts of Maharashtra, especially Raigad, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray asked state officials to accelerate works on the World Bank-funded National Cyclone Risk Mitigation Project (NCRMP) on a war footing. The 2015 project includes construction of underground power cables, building multiple hurricane-resistant shelters, strengthening houses and creating an early-warning dissemination system. As per the state records, works worth ₹203.77 crore are already in progress in Raigad, Ratnagiri and Palghar. The total project cost is about ₹398 crores. “Apart from underground cables which the chief minister has stressed on, the state is looking at setting up 30 shelters, rebuilding damaged houses using concrete slabs, and installing lighting arresters in areas prone to frequent power-outages,” a state official said. Around 11 shelters have been built under the project so far. Thackeray undertook a review meeting with officials from the state disaster management department and relief and rehabilitation units on Monday. Cyclone Nisarga made a landfall in Raigad district last Wednesday damaging lakhs of houses, trees, and electric poles. Power and water supply has also been hit in many parts of the coastal districts. In 2015, the World Bank approved funds for implementing phase-2 of the NCRMP to “reduce vulnerability to cyclone and other hydro-meteorological hazards of coastal communities in the states of Goa, Gujarat, Karnataka, Kerala, Maharashtra, and West Bengal.” In Phase-1, works were undertaken in the states of Odisha and West Bengal, the World Bank website states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-cm-asks-state-officials-to-accelerate-cyclone-mitigation-project/story-IKrMxc0DzIKil7wZfz5wKL.html
09-06-2020||City||3 arrested for killing Ghansoli civil contractor||Rabale police on Monday arrested three men in connection with the murder of a Ghansoli-based civil contractor Pravin Tayde who was shot dead over business rivalry, said police. The police have identified Jayesh Patil, 37, a civil contractor, as the main accused who allegedly conspired with accomplices Santosh Dora alias Guddu, 22, and Devendra Mali, 22. Inspector Girish Gore of Ghansoli police station said as Tayde was getting more contracts Patil got irked and decided to carry out the crime. “We are probing to establish for how long they were planning the murder,” he said. The incident took place on Thursday, when Tayde was riding his scooters with his friend Dattatrey Jognand in Talavli village. Patil arrived there with Dora and Mali in an Alto car, and upon spotting Tayde, Dora walked up to him and shot him in the face, said police. Mali also allegedly fired in Tayde’s direction from the car but failed. As the trio were trying to escape in their car, Jognand tried to stop them but Patil rammed the car into him which smashed the windshield, said police. “Knowing that the damaged vehicle would raise suspicion, the men abandoned the car at Varisht Chowk in Koparkhairane and boarded an auto for Kalyan. However, as they hopped from Thane, to Lonavala and then to Kamshet, they ran out of money,” said a police source.Meanwhile, with the help of CCTV footage and eye-witness accounts, the police recovered Patil’s car on Saturday while a police team chased the trio to Kamshet but failed to nab them.A police officer said following a tip-off that Patil and Dora would be arriving near National Institute of Fashion Technology (NIFT) in Kharghar to collect money, the police nabbed them.“We recovered two pistols and six live cartridges from their possession and later nabbed their third accomplice. They have been booked on charges of murder,” said Yogesh Gawde, senior inspector at Ghansoli police station.All three accused have petty cases of assaults against them. Police are probing where they procured the weapon from and are likely to make more arrests in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/3-arrested-for-killing-ghansoli-civil-contractor/story-KBA1Jj2PiCKqShKxdChFHO.html
09-06-2020||Mumbai||A first under FEO Act: Court nod for confiscation of Nirav’s assets||A special court on Monday ordered the confiscation of the properties of diamantaire Nirav Modi, the main accused in the ₹23,780-crore Punjab National Bank (PNB) fraud, under the Fugitive Economic Offenders’ (FEO) Act, 2018.The confiscation order against Nirav, who is lodged at a London prison while his extradition proceedings are pending, is the first under the two-year-old act.Special judge VC Barde ordered for the confiscation of the properties within a month, but exempted assets mortgaged and hypothecated with PNB and its consortium, Andhra Bank and Oriental Bank of India. Barde’s order will allow the Enforcement Directorate (ED) to confiscate properties of Modi, after which the money will be deposited with the Central government.The order also sees that the banks will be at liberty to file their claims with ED and tribunal authorities for their rights over properties.ED had listed properties, valued at ₹1,396.07 crore, which it claimed was purchased or owned by Nirav using proceeds of crime, for confiscation. However, in the order passed on Monday, the court has also made specific mention on the paintings seized by the income tax (I-T) department. The court has directed ED to attach the paintings within a month and proceed to confiscate them.Nirav was declared FEO under the new law on December 5, 2019, after which the court began the process towards confiscation of his properties. The court refused to permit Nirav to intervene in the process, but allowed banks to be heard.While declaring Nirav as FEO, Barde had observed that Nirav left the country under suspicious circumstances to “dodge the penal consequences of the acts he has done or committed while in India till the year 2017”.“It can be gathered that as on date when the respondent left the country, that is on January 1, 2018, he was in know of the fact of due dates of payments (to the bank) which was November 25, 2018, and left the country therefore in suspicion circumstances,” observed the court in the order passed on Thursday.Nirav had contended that he could not return to India as he was arrested in UK. They had also pleaded to keep the proceedings in abeyance. The court rejected their plea and noted that Modi was arrested by the UK police on March 19, 2019, after a long time subsequent to the filing of ED’s application under the FEO Act. The court held that there was ample time for him to return to India before his arrest in London.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/a-first-under-feo-act-court-nod-for-confiscation-of-nirav-s-assets/story-5sA7lNRY89W0t5FGkivLPM.html
09-06-2020||Chandigarh||FIR against ex-DGP Saini: Punjab Police question CBI move to weed out record in court||The Punjab Police has questioned the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) move to weed out record of a 1991 case of alleged abduction and fake encounter of Balwant Singh Multani, involving former state Director General of Police (DGP) Sumedh Singh Saini. Multani, who worked as a junior engineer with the Chandigarh Industrial and Tourism Corporation (CITCO), was picked up, allegedly, by two police officers after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then Chandigarh SSP, in which four policemen in his security were killed. Later, the police claimed that Multani, son of a former IAS officer, had escaped from the custody of the Qadian police in Punjab and his whereabouts, since then, are not known.On Monday, the state police filed an application before a Chandigarh court, submitting that in 2016, the Punjab and Haryana high court had returned a status report in the case in sealed cover to the investigating agency. The application added that the status report also included the documents, which the police are now seeking in the wake of an FIR registered against Saini and seven others for alleged kidnapping, causing disappearance and wrongful confinement in Mohali on the complaint of Multani’s brother Palwinder Singh Multani, last month. A Mohali court has granted bail to Saini. The state police have also questioned as to how the record was weeded out within four years of the CBI getting it from the high court.On Saturday, the CBI had told the court that it had returned the documents to the departments concerned or the same were weeded out as per policy, which mandates it to keep records for five years only. The agency’s response had come on an application moved by the state police, seeking documents of the preliminary probe, when the CBI was investigating the disappearance of Multani in 2007. The CBI had probed the matter on a direction from the high court. The probe, however, was closed in view of the Supreme Court quashing the high court order in 2011. The matter will now be taken up on Thursday by the court of the special magistrate, Ravish Kaushik, when the CBI is to respond to the issues that the state police has raised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fir-against-ex-dgp-saini-punjab-police-question-cbi-move-to-weed-out-record-in-court/story-cxjh74ujx6LTKw0qwbbagK.html
09-06-2020||City||Nilje ROB on Kalyan-Shilphata road to be closed from June 15||Nilje Railway over-bridge (ROB) over Diva-Panvel railway route, part of the busy Kalyan-Shilphata stretch, will be shut for repair works from midnight June 15, traffic police officers said on Monday.A safety audit of the 50-year-old bridge was carried out by the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), which stated the structure of the bridge is unsafe and should be closed immediately. It was said that in view of the safety of the railway as well as road traffic, it is suggested that the ROB be immediately shut for road traffic.Central Railway (CR) had in May decided to shut the bridge and informed the concerned officials of Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) and the traffic police. On June 5, the traffic police released a notification on closing the bridge and mentioned that the raffic would be diverted to the parallel new bridge.After a part of the Andheri’s Gokhale bridge collapsed on July 3, 2018, both the Central and Western Railway appointed a team of experts from IIT-B to inspect 445 bridges that cross the railway tracks in the city.“After the Andheri ROB incident, the railway had undertaken the audit of all ROBs. This (Nilje) ROB has been declared unsafe, based on which we have decided to shut it. The bridge will be completely shut for all vehicles from June 15,”said a CR official requesting anonymity.The 21-km-long Kalyan-Shilphata route, which connects Kalyan-Dombivli-Bhiwandi-Thane to Navi Mumbai, is a vital link and sees a major congestion during peak hours. The traffic police department said the closure of Nilje bridge would lead to increase in the congestion.“If the bridge is shut, the entire load will be on the parallel bridge. We will have to deploy more traffic cops to man the traffic. The congestion will be more,” said a traffic police from Kalyan (East) traffic unit.Followed by the decision to close the bridge, MLA Raju Patil appealed to MSRDC to repair the bridge and make it open to small vehicles during monsoon to ease traffic congestion.“The Patripool bridge on the Kalyan-Shilphata stretch has already been dismantled and a new bridge it yet come up, Durgadi bridge on this stretch is narrow. If this third bridge is also shut for traffic, then commuters will have to face lot of trouble during monsoon.”An MSRDC official requesting anonymity said, “There is a plan to build a new bridge after dismantling this unsafe bridge. Repairing the bridge and allowing small vehicles has not been considered yet. We have received a demand to repair the bridge and open for small vehicles which will be discussed with higher authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nilje-rob-on-kalyan-shilphata-road-to-be-closed-from-june-15/story-s8xrF31gB67DYU17mSPckK.html
09-06-2020||Mumbai||Matang leader moves HC seeking regulation of MLC nominations||Matang community leader Diliprao Agale has moved the Bombay high court (HC) seeking to regulate the Governor’s power to nominate members of the legislative Council (MLC). The Matang community is a scheduled caste in Maharashtra.In his petition, filed through advocate SB Talekar, the 58-year-old social worker has sought a declaration that clauses 3(e) and 5 of Article 171 of the Constitution are beyond the legal powers of Article 14 and the rule of law.Article 171(3)(e) empowers the Governor to nominate members on the legislative Council and Article 171(5) requires that the persons to be appointed have special knowledge or practical experience in literature, science, arts, cooperative movement, and social service. Article 14 prevents states from denying any person equality before the law.“No doubt enough guidance is provided as to the qualification or eligibility criteria of the nominated members,” stated the petition, adding, “However, there is nothing prescribing the mode and manner to nominate members on the state legislative Council.”Agale has complained that there are no parameters and tests in place to select the candidates for nomination.The Maharashtra legislative Council has 78 members, of which 66 are elected and the remaining 12 are nominated by the Governor.Agale’s petition stated that all proposals for the nomination of members on legislative Councils, under the Maharashtra Government Rules of Business, are required to be submitted to the chief minister, and the Governor nominates the members based on recommendations made by the chief minister.He further complained that no scrutiny is done to ascertain that the person recommended for nomination fulfills the essential requirements, or if he had incurred disqualification, as contemplated by Article 191.Besides, the persons to be nominated by the Governor are not required to make disclosures of their wealth and criminal past, if any, as is required in elections to the state and Central legislature.Therefore, according to Agale, the power to nominate becomes unfair, arbitrary, and discriminatory, as it is open to the chief minister to pick and choose persons to be nominated as per their whims and fancies.The power conferred on the Governor is thus, not only arbitrary but has no place in a polity governed by the rule of law. It is also a violation of the mandate of equality enshrined in Article 14, the petition stated.The actions of the chief minister, the Council of ministers or the Governor has to be fair, impartial, and based on the realistic assessment as to whether the person to be nominated has the required special knowledge or practical experience, by following due procedure, it added.The social worker mentioned that he was also aggrieved by the fact that there are thousands of individuals who meet the requirements for such nomination, but only those who are “close to the centres of power or those who enjoy the confidence of those in power” are considered for nomination on the Council.“The selection is done either on party lines or depending on who is close to or in the good books of the chief minister or high command of the party in power,” the petition stated. “Barring a few exceptions, most of those nominated were either active politicians or persons affiliated or associated with the party in power, or individuals enjoying political patronage,” it added.Agale has submitted that unless the concerns expressed by some members of the Constituent Assembly – that the nominations would be made on political lines rather than merit – are addressed and remedied promptly, the same will continue to perpetuate a corrupt system.Besides, he also complained about the disparity within scheduled castes in Maharashtra as regards the representation of various communities, contending that the major benefit of the reservation provided for the category is taken by the predominant Magar community, although their population is more or less the same.The petition will come up for hearing on June 16 before a division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Surendra Tavade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/matang-leader-moves-hc-seeking-regulation-of-mlc-nominations/story-ApkYv06fwDEe2hHgvR1t2N.html

Sharma is a resident of Gijhor village under Sector 24 police jurisdiction and is currently associated with Rashtriya Lok Dal.“He was present on the side of the expressway going from Sirsa toll to Dadri, opposite village Rampur Fatehpur. There were 15 to 20 other people with them who were celebrating someone’s birthday, while at least eight or nine vehicles had been parked on the side of the road. They were dispersed by the patrolling PRV,” stated the police complaint.The complaint further said Sharma and his associates violated all social distancing norms during the celebrations. Based on the complaint, a case was registered against them under sections 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant), 269 (negligent act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life) of the Indian Penal Code.Police officers said the matter is under investigation while all his associates are being identified.“Several factors such as how long they had been there for are a part of the ongoing investigation. The offences are bailable and due action is being taken,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 3, Rajesh Kumar Singh.The police said that Sharma and his associates were violating section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrpC) which has been implemented in the district till June 30 and prohibits the gathering of more than five people.Sharma, however, said he was not on the EPE to celebrate a birthday. “My mother-in-law had passed away, and I was on my way to Bulandshahr. The people with me were acquaintances from a nearby village who had come to see me. It wasn’t even my birthday,” the former MLA said.Gautam Budh Nagar police has so far arrested more than 7,000 people and registered nearly 2,000 cases against violations of the lockdown under CrPC section 188.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/former-mla-associates-booked-for-celebrating-a-birthday-on-expressway/story-8TOIKsLvSYTh2IZinyVb3J.html

He added the police have been conducting raids for the arrest of the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ludhiana-farmer-accomplice-attack-farm-officers-for-asking-him-not-to-transplant-paddy-before-june-10/story-giX10gGiHCIlj2oKNJVABP.html
09-06-2020||Chandigarh||After a brief lull, Punjab sees spike in Covid cases again||Punjab witnessed a surge in Covid-19 cases after a partial relief for some days, with 403 more people testing positive and eight persons succumbing to the infection since June 1. In past two three days only, the state recorded over 200 cases against 202 cases between May 20 and May 29. Of the patients found positive since June 1, around one-third (33%) are those who came from outside the state or returned to India from abroad in special flights. “The main reason behind this surge is that people have started taking things lightly. Also, they are not caring two hoots about the social-distancing norms,” state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said.28,785 PEOPLE TESTED IN 5 DAYSExperts believe that another reason behind the surge in cases was due to increase in testing as an average 6,000 people were tested daily in the past five days. Targeted sampling has increased in Punjab, say health officials, adding that patients are checked at all 214 flu corners in civil and sub-divisional hospitals. So far, the state health department has conducted 1,29,821 tests, of which 28,785 were done between June 4 and 8. “This is another reason why more cases are surfacing. We are planning to test 9,000 people daily,” said a senior health official. Also, only 60 patients (nearly 2%) of the total number of people infected in Punjab so far have shown acute symptoms after they contracted the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-a-brief-lull-punjab-sees-spike-in-covid-cases-again/story-spX1Qv1YotnjZiukefnumK.html
09-06-2020||City||All courts now functional in Gautam Budh Nagar||All courts in the Gautam Budh Nagar district have resumed operations from Monday.“Earlier only four courts were functioning virtually through video conferencing.

09-06-2020||Noida||Places of worship reopen, people refrain from visiting||Several places of worship in the district opened their doors to the public on Monday, nearly 80 days after they first closed on March 19. However, there didn’t seem to be too much footfall on Day One.According to government guidelines, all places of worship that reopen will have to ensure that they thermally screen devotees, sanitise the premises and that devotees follow social distancing norms. The places of worship cannot allow over five people inside at a time, or let footwear cluster. The guidelines also specifically allow only asymptomatic people to visit these places.Religious places in the district, except for those in containment zones, opened up on Monday morning.“Everything went smoothly. We followed all the government guidelines. There weren’t too many visitors in the morning. We allowed only five people inside at a time. We are not restarting the langar for now. We have asked all devotees to remove their footwear in their vehicles only,” Gurpreet Singh, part of the management of the Sector 18 gurudwara, said.Most of these places have marked the floor to ensure that visitors follow the norms of social distancing.“We have shaved off two hours from our earlier timings. Nearly 40-50 people came today, most of whom were families, which is less than the regular number of visitors, but things will pick up gradually. We held a havan first and then opened our doors to the public. Even Member of Parliament Dr Mahesh Sharma came to offer his prayers. We are ensuring that people wear masks. We are also cleaning the premises regularly,” Sanjay Bali, general secretary, Sanatan Dharam temple, said.Churches in the district will not open their doors up till the end of this month. The Iskcon temple in Sector 33 also didn’t reopen on Monday. Its board will decide when to open up later this week.The police said that there was no law and order situation nor was any place shut for violating guidelines.“We had met with representatives of all religions, who had assured us they will follow all guidelines. Senior officials also visited a few places. No one reported any incident. For now, even the public is refraining from going out and there are no problems,” Sankalp Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, said.Most mosques under the Sector 20 jurisdiction, including the Jama Masjid, did not reopen on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/places-of-worship-reopen-people-refrain-from-visiting/story-KUBng4WgjAga9MilbGT79I.html
09-06-2020||Noida||Delhi opens borders, commuters face Monday rush||Heavy traffic jams continued to persist during peak hours at the Delhi-Noida borders on Monday as the national capital lifted all restrictions on interstate travel.Entry into Noida from Delhi was regulated by Gautam Budh Nagar district administration and only people with passes were allowed to cross the border.The Delhi government had on May 31 announced that it will seal its borders with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana for seven days to contain the spread of Covid-19 infection.“The situation is terrible in the evenings. Noida police have set up barricades blocking the access for free movement of vehicles. The policemen just stand there without much checking. In the evening, traffic starts crawling from the Kalindi Kunj bridge itself. It is a daily struggle now,” said Vivek Krishna, who travels to Delhi’s Jasola for work from Greater Noida west daily.Some commuters also alleged that getting into Noida during evening and morning peak hours was much more difficult than getting into Delhi.“Even when Delhi had sealed the borders, movement into the capital was not an issue. But getting into Noida is a harrowing task everyday. Crossing DND takes more than 30 minutes. Today, the traffic was terrible during peak hours at Kalindi Kunj, so I turned back and then entered Noida via DND around 9.30am . A few of my colleagues came around noon and their experience was better. Peak hour traffic is a menace with Noida continuing with its border checking,” said Amrinder Singh, who travels from Faridabad to Noida daily for work.Commuters said there was clarity and some felt that restrictions would be lifted from June 8. However, Noida — which had sealed its borders with Delhi in April — continues to maintain a status quo.“The MHA guidelines have permitted interstate travel but Noida continues to keep the border sealed. This creates confusion for people travelling across the borders. Even the Supreme Court has now intervened. So hopefully the situation will change ,” said a commuter, on condition of anonymity.On Monday, to ease rush hour traffic Noida police had opened six lanes of the DND. According to regulations, only people with administrative passes and those providing essential services are allowed to travel across the border.Barricades placed by Delhi police at the Noida gate were also manned by the Gautam Budh Nagar district police on Monday morning.“This was done to ensure that people don’t go to Delhi without valid reasons and then don’t create chaos in the evening while returning. There are no changes in the regulations and until any further orders, the border will continue to be sealed,” said Sankalp Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, zone 1.Officials had claimed that traffic volume had gone down after Delhi sealed the borders last week. However, peak hour rush continues to be a problem.In an order of the district administration from May 31, it had been clarified that the border will remain sealed until further notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/delhi-opens-borders-commuters-face-monday-rush/story-0PQFyb4nm0FCqRdfBf881N.html
09-06-2020||Noida||Noida shopping malls open for business, but only a few visitors turn up||After the government permitted the reopening of shopping malls from Monday, a few of them opened for business in the city after being shut for over 70 days, owing to the nationwide lockdown from March 25 on account of Covid-19 pandemic. All necessary precautions to combat the pandemic were taken and marshals deployed to ensure social distancing among visitors.In Noida, while most of the major shopping malls, including DLF Mall of India and Great India Place at Sector 18 and Logix at City Centre remained close, a few such as the Gaur City Mall at Greater Noida West, Shopprix at Sector 61 and Wave Mall in Sector 18 opened on Monday.The malls, especially food courts, however, wore a deserted look with only very strolling around. Mall managers were hopeful that business will pick up within a week. For now, they said they are focused on building trust among customers. A number of shops in these malls were also closed and so were dine-in restaurants. Only fast-food and eatery chains were open for business but these too saw thin attendance.Compulsory hand sanitisation and temperature screening were seen at the entry gates of malls and all malls followed the ‘no mask no entry’ policy strictly. Extra staff were deployed on the premises to ensure social distancing among visitors.“We hope that in the coming months, visitors will start coming like they used to. Obviously, people are scared and wary due to the pandemic, so what we are doing is building up their trust in us. We had started preparations for reopening a few days back, including cleaning the mall, sanitising all spaces and training our staff in accordance with the norms given by the government. As a precautionary measure, we have also restricted entry of elderly people over 65 years of age and children below 10 years,” Vikas Tyagi, vice-president, Supertech Shopprix mall in Sector 61, said.At Gaur City Mall in Greater Noida West, the staff had deployed ‘Covid marshals’ to ensure that people keep their masks on and don’t hold hands.“These marshals will ensure people maintain the social distancing. Our main aim is to ensure that people start trusting that malls are a safe space, and towards that end, we are taking all safety precaution,” the mall manager at Gaur City Mall said, without wishing to reveal his name. Of a total of 150 shops at Gaur Mall, more than half remained closed. “All the store owners had been given a presentation on the standards that they will have to adhere to, including sanitising hands of every customer. Since this is the first day, we are happy to see even the thin attendance and are hopeful that things will get back to normal within a week,” the manager said. With posters reading ‘this toilet had been sanitised’ and ‘ dos and dont’s, the malls have also pasted stickers on elevators to ensure social distancing.Meanwhile a few shopping malls stated that they are not yet prepared and will take a week’s time to make all necessary arrangements to ensure public safety.“We are not ready yet to open and are taking all necessary preparations. It will take at least a week or so to restart operations,” Shamim Anwar, PRO, Great India Place (GIP) in Sector 18, said.The Logix mall at Noida City Centre said it will start operations from Tuesday.The state government’s standard operating procedure (SOPs) ask the malls to ensure social distancing, mandatory thermal screening, masks, staggered entries and operations of food courts at 50% seating capacity. Mall managers have been advised to have an isolation room to keep any worker or visitor showing symptoms of Covid-19, till medical help arrives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-shopping-malls-open-for-business-but-only-a-few-visitors-turn-up/story-YTpvbnigwzujtfQRhaC83J.html
09-06-2020||Noida||Noida: Private hospitals to keep track of cross notified Covid-19 positive cases||Alarmed with the rising coronavirus (Covid-19) disease positive cases in the district due to patients coming from other neighbouring districts and Delhi, the Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has decided to keep a tab on private hospitals. Since the testing in the district is easier than in Delhi, Ghaziabad, Bulandshahr and Meerut, many patients give the addresses and phone numbers of their relatives living in Gautam Budh Nagar to get their tests done, officials said. As a result of this influx of patients from other places, the number of cases has been increasing. On June 1, the state health department had stated in a report that in the last 20 days, source of infections of 42% of all the Covid-19 positive cases in the district has been tracked to Delhi. District magistrate Suhas LY has said that private hospitals have been asked to check properly the medical records of the patients coming from other states and districts to Noida. “We can’t ask any hospital for stopping the treatment of patients. But at the same time, we can’t risk the lives of our residents. Before coming for treatment of coronavirus from various places to the Noida district, the patients must have the proper letter of reference from competent health officials of their respective places,” he said.The DM further said that this scrutiny will not only smoothen the process of contact tracing, but will also reduce the number of patients being cross-notified to other places. “If we do not put a check on such cases, it will put an unnecessary burden on us. We have limited beds in our Covid-19 facilities in different hospitals for Gautam Budh Nagar residents. If those seats are occupied by others, what will we do for our own people,” he said.Of the total positive cases in the district on June 7, while 41 patients who tested Covid-positive were from Gautam Budh Nagar, 48 patients who tested Covid-positive were from other places, including 15 from Delhi and 7 from Ghaziabad.The DM also said that the Delhi-Noida border will continue to remain sealed and only essential services, having requisite documentation, will be allowed to move. Stating that the rising number of Covid-19 cases is a reason for the step, he said that after consultation and consent of health and police departments, it was decided in public interest that status quo shall be maintained with respect to inter-state borders. “As far as the Supreme Court’s instructions on Thursday regarding easing inter-state movement at all borders of the National Capital Region (NCR) is concerned, we are waiting for the fresh guidelines from the state headquarters and we’ll certainly follow them,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-private-hospitals-to-keep-track-of-cross-notified-covid-19-positive-cases/story-2000rStPRxVaIVujQGYPAK.html
09-06-2020||Gurugram||One killed, two injured in accident||A 44-year-old man died while his two friends were injured when their car rammed several poles in Dhankot village on Sunday evening. The police have registered a case against the car driver, who is recuperating at a hospital. According to the police, the deceased man has been identified as Jaswant Singh, a resident of Dhankot. The police said that around 7.20pm, Singh and his friends, Kartar and Anil, were on their way to Farrukhnagar from Dhankot. The police said Anil was driving the car, which suddenly veered into a non-motorable road at a high speed, and after about 300 metres, collided with some metal poles on a field. The airbags of the car deployed on impact and the car flipped on its side. A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said the victim was seated in the co-driver’s seat and succumbed to injuries on the spot. “Anil, who was driving the car, and Kartar, who was seated in the rear, suffered injuries and were taken to Civil Hospital for treatment. Their condition is stable. In his statement, Kartar said that Anil was speeding and despite their repeated requests, he did not slow down the car, resulting in the crash. A case has been registered against Anil,” the police officer said. A case was registered against him under sections 279 (rash driving or riding on a public way), 304 A (death by negligence), 337 (causing hurt by act endangering life or personal safety of others) of the Indian Penal Code at the Rajendra Park police station, the police said. In another incident, a 44-year-old woman was killed after a car allegedly hit her near Narsinghpur on National Highway 48 on Monday morning. The police said the incident took place around 7.30am when the victim, Nirmala Devi, was walking to her office. The police said the car, allegedly driven at a high speed, hit her and she fell. The driver abandoned the vehicle and escaped from the area. With the help of the police and passersby, she was rushed to a private hospital, where she was declared dead on arrival. The police said the woman was from Bihar and had been staying in Khandsa village. The abandoned car has been confiscated and the police are trying to trace the driver with the help of regional transport authority officials. A case has been registered at the Sector 37 police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/one-killed-two-injured-in-accident/story-j7f68FxTD4omXEoXhrdZdP.html
09-06-2020||Gurugram||Restaurants closed even as state issues reopening guidelines||Many restaurants in the city decided not to resume their dine-in facilities on Monday, a day after the government allowed them to reopen and released guidelines restricting the number of guests to only 50% of the total capacity. The government has not allowed the reopening of bars in restaurants.Though takeaway services through aggregators have been operational—food chains are open for this purpose in Sector 29, Sohna Road, Golf Course Road and Cyber Hub—restaurants wore a deserted look on Monday. Inderjeet Banga, the owner of Prankster and Pirates of Grill, and chapter head of Gurugram National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), said that reopening restaurants for dine-in services will not make any commercial sense with restrictions on serving liquor and timings. “It is not possible for the industry to resume business with just one day’s notice. We have to keep in mind the social distancing and new hygiene norms and make preparations accordingly,” he said.The restaurant owners said that it was too early to resume operations as most people are likely to only prefer eating at home given the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Satya Mohanty, a restaurant owner, said that they are keeping the restaurant closed to safeguard the health of employees and visitors. “With the increasing number of cases in the city, it is safe to not open the outlets until the situation is under control,” he said.There are about 300 pubs, bars and restaurants, and about 25 hotels wherein liquor is available as part of dine-in services in Gurugram. All these establishments have been shut since March 22, the Janata Curfew day, since the Covid-19 pandemic triggered a lockdown. The industry is seeking the government’s help to tide over their burgeoning losses.Pushpendra Yadav, director, Quaff microbrewery, said that the government should make it viable for them to reopen after the lockdown. “We expect revenue sharing-based rent, reduced excise fees, credit tax input and reduction in maintenance and electricity rates. All stakeholders need to walk hand-in-hand to come out of this unprecedented situation,” he said.Ishan Grover, a consultant brewer, said that in Haryana, microbreweries have received no relief from the government. “Our cost of operating is too high. Bengaluru, on the other hand, can manage because the state government has allowed the takeaway of beer in 2litre bottles from microbreweries,” he said.The excise officials said that unless the bars are reopened, they will play no role in monitoring the restaurants. “The bars are still closed and no one has permission to serve liquor in their outlets. If anyone is found violating the lockdown norms, strict action will be taken against them,” HC Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west), said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/restaurants-closed-even-as-state-issues-reopening-guidelines/story-sayWOLZVed2OrSxjq0wdLO.html
09-06-2020||Delhi||Few beds left for Covid-19 patients in Delhi even as govt app shows 50% availability||Most hospitals in the city – both public and private – do not have beds left for patients with coronavirus disease (Covid-19), especially those with severe infection in need of oxygen or ventilator support.Yet, even as people with Covid-19 struggle to find free beds in hospitals, the Delhi government app shows that nearly half of the 8,821 beds available in the city are vacant. As per the app, 4,487 beds are occupied.Only two of the 15 private hospitals across Delhi that HT called said they had beds readily available. One of the hospitals – Saroj Superspeciality hospital in Rohini – informed that they had started admitting Covid-19 patients only from Monday. Saroj hist social media stardom Monday after a circular issued by the hospital saying the minimum bill for a patient, irrespective of duration of treatment, would be Rs 3 lakh, going up to Rs 8 lakh for an intensive care unit bed. The hospital said it was an old circular. When HT called the hospital reception and asked for Covid-19 charges, the hospital said an advance of R 1.5 lakh would be required.Batra hospital in Mehrauli said only one bed was available. However the app, last updated Sunday afternoon, showed there were 11 vacant beds.Two other hospitals, Holy Family in Okhla and Park hospital in Vishnu Garden said all their beds with ventilator or oxygen support were occupied. One of the hospitals had 14 beds and the other 22 beds, according to the ‘Delhi Corona’ app.And NKS hospital in Gulabi Bagh and Primus hospital in Chanakyapuri said they would call whenever a bed became available.Primus hospital called back within a couple of hours asking for the patient ID .Two hospitals Max hospital in Saket and Sir Ganga Ram hospital could not be reached and the rest said they were out of beds. At government hospitalsHT also got in touch with five big government hospitals to see whether they had beds available for Covid-19 patients. Only the two Delhi government-run hospitals – Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur – said that the patient could be brought immediately to the hospital emergency.The person manning the phone at Lok Nayak, however, said “Please bring your patient here only if they are critical. The hospital admits only severe cases and if the patient is fine, they will be asked to go back.”Lok Nayak hospital is the biggest Covid-19 treatment facility in Delhi with 2,000 beds, which is followed by 1,500 beds in GTB hospital. Currently, there are 900 Covid-19 patients admitted to Lok Nayak hospital and 178 in GTB, which was designated as a Covid-19 hospital only on May 30.Government guidelines mandate that only those with severe disease -- an elevated respiratory rate of 30 or more (normal is 12 to 20 for an adult) or oxygen saturation of less than 90% (normal is 95 to 100%) -- would be admitted. Safdarjung hospital advised that the situation of beds was very dynamic, only a few are available at any given time. “You have to come here with the patient and check whether it is available. The app does not always show it accurately,” said the person manning the phone at central-government-run Safdarjung hospital. The app showed three beds were available at the hospital.At All India Institute of Medical Sciences, the screening centre said, “Please do not bring your patient here. All the beds are full, it would be better if you try going to other hospitals. Do not go to Ram Manohar Lohia as their beds are also full. You should try Lok Nayak or GTB hospital.” According to the Delhi Corona app there were 145 beds available at AIIMS Delhi.At RML hospital, the operator said: “Please come with all the patient details and meet the medical superintendent. There are no beds available currently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-beds-at-most-delhi-hospitals-yet-govt-app-shows-availability/story-mLSBIAfH54is3OTvCQIR9O.html
09-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi will revert to ICMR guidelines, asymptomatic contacts will be tested||With lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal on Monday reversing the Delhi government’s restrictions on testing for Covid-19, the tests for confirming the viral disease in the national capital will now be done on the parameters set by the country’s apex health research body – the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).On June 2, the Delhi government had released its own testing strategy, deviating from the strategy laid down by ICMR.There were nine categories of people who need to be tested, according to the ICMR guidelines. These include asymptomatic direct contacts (those living in the same house or working in close proximity to a positive person) who are to be tested between Day 5 and Day 10 of coming in contact with the infected person.Delhi government had tightened this criterion to exclude asymptomatic direct contacts who weren’t aged or had no co-morbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension and/or cancer.Monday’s order from the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), of which L-G Baijal is the chairman, said, “In order to contain the spread of Covid-19, it is essential to conduct a thorough contact tracing of affected persons, and as such, the ICMR strategy for Covid-19 testing should be followed without any deviation.”“Any deviation from the ICMR guidelines can result in inadequate contact tracing of affected individuals and can result in further spread of Covid-19 in Delhi,” the order further said.A person at one the laboratories conducting Covid-19 tests said on condition of anonymity, “Asymptomatic direct contacts must be tested as they are very likely to have the infection. What if the husband tests positive, and the wife is asymptomatic? As per Delhi government rules, she cannot be tested and may pass on the infection to others, who may become severely ill. Even the WHO says testing is the way to defeat the infection.”Earlier, in an interview with HT, director of All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria had said the testing threshold had to be lowered so that even if there is a slight suspicion that a person is infected, then (s)he should be able to get tested.The other categories set by ICMR for testing are – all symptomatic individuals with a history of international travel in the last 14 days; all symptomatic contacts of laboratory confirmed cases; all symptomatic healthcare/ frontline workers; all patients of severe acute respiratory infection; all symptomatic people within the hotspots or containment zones; all hospitalised patients who develop influenza-like illness; all symptomatic migrants within seven days of illness; and those in need of emergency procedure.Here, symptomatic means people with fever of more than 100°F, cough, and respiratory infection.“The testing strategies of ICMR so far have been based on the assumption that there was no community transmission. However, once there is community transmission, there is no point in contact tracing. Then, the strategy should change to testing all people clinically diagnosed to have Covid-19 to confirm the infection,” Dr T Jacob John, professor emeritus and former head of department of virology at Christian Medical College, Vellore, said.“Had the Delhi government removed the other restrictions -- symptomatic people have to be tested only if they have a travel history or only those residing in hotspots -- and tested all symptomatic patients, I would have called Delhi’s testing strategy more forward and similar to those in developed countries where there is community transmission of the infection. The country as a whole now needs to rethink the testing strategy,” Dr John said.NO COVID TESTS IN DELHI FOR SECOND DAYSeveral private laboratories did not collect Covid-19 samples for the second day on Monday. Of the 10 private laboratories that HT called on Monday, four didn’t answer, while five said they were not providing the service “temporarily”. One lab had a token system in place—patients had to come early morning to give their samples on a first-come-first-served basis.HT had reported on Sunday that most private laboratories in Delhi had either capped the number of people they test a day or were not collecting samples, making it difficult for patients to get tested for Covid-19.The labs that have temporarily stopped collecting samples include City X-Ray and Scan Clinic in Tilak Nagar, and Lifeline Laboratory in Green Park (which is at capacity and cannot test any more samples until it clears the backlog). Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute said it could collect samples only if the Conquest laboratory, the firm to which it had outsourced Covid-19 testing, was ready to test.The government banned eight labs from testing on June 5 for not following protocols, and, according to health minister Satyendar Jain, taking too long to report results. These include Dr Lal Pathlabs, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Prognosis laboratory, SRL reference laboratory, Fortis Hospital, Star Imaging Path laboratory, Pathkind labs and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The ICMR now recognises 23 private laboratories for Covid-19 testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-will-now-revert-to-icmr-guidelines-for-testing-even-asymptomatic-direct-contacts-will-be-tested/story-AObQKBiVbacVlS8Q472ulN.html
09-06-2020||Delhi||L-G’s order will pose a new challenge for people of Delhi, says Kejriwal||Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia accused the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which leads the ruling coalition at the Centre, of pressuring the L-G into overturning the Delhi government’s decision. He questioned if the BJP would take responsibility for the loss of lives of Delhi residents for non-availability of hospital beds.The BJP hit back, calling the Delhi government’s decision insensitive.Kejriwal said in a tweet on Monday: ““The L-G’s order has created a very big problem and challenge for the people of Delhi. Providing treatment for people coming from all over the country during the coronavirus epidemic is a big challenge. Probably it is God’s will that we serve the people of the entire country. We will try to provide treatment for all.” The L-G office did not comment.On Sunday, the Delhi government had ordered that beds in hospitals under it and private hospitals – barring those that conduct specialised surgeries in the fields of organ transplant, oncology and neurology – should be reserved for people of Delhi, even as it opened the city’s borders with neighbouring states. Hospitals under the central government were open for all.As proof of residence, the government had prepared a list of documents, including passport, Aadhaar card, voters’ card, drivers’ licence, electricity, gas and water bills, bank passbook, post office current account, among few others with a valid Delhi address.But on Monday, the L-G overturned the Delhi government’s decision, saying the government’s order did not conform with the “right to health”, which is an “integral part of Right to Life” under Article 21 of the Constitution.In a press briefing held hours after the L-G’s order, Sisodia said: “The BJP in the central government should rather coordinate with states rather than creating obstructions and not indulge in politics over the coronavirus pandemic. Delhi government had drafted a well-planned strategy regarding hospital beds. But the BJP pressured the L-G into overturning the government’s order. What if all beds in Delhi get occupied within 2-3 days by patients from other states and that leads to the death of a Delhi resident who fails to avail a hospital bed, who will take the responsibility?”“States ruled by BJP have failed in Covid management. In states such as Gujarat and Himachal Pradesh, scams over PPE are being reported. But still, they are hell-bent on politicising the issue. I demand that the central government rolls back the decision (referring to L-G’s order) and invest time and efforts in the management of the pandemic instead of politics. State governments followed the central lockdown. Now, when states take a call on healthcare infrastructure management, the central government should respect that and cooperate,” Sisodia said.In response to Sisodia’s allegations, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said, “The government’s decision was insensitive. The L-G has done the right thing by overruling it. In this hour of crisis, AAP should refrain from indulging in politics and focus on improving facilities for people. Their decision to stop testing of asymptomatic contacts of Covid-19 positive patients was against ICMR and Centre’s guidelines.

09-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt suspects community spread, may change strategy to combat Covid-19||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia Monday hinted at the drafting of a strategy for Covid-19 management in Delhi in the light of a possible community spread, even as city health minister Satyendar Jain estimated that the capital is likely to witness more than 56,000 fresh Covid-19 cases by the end of the next two weeks.In a video press briefing on Monday, Sisodia said the state disaster management authority’s (SDMA) meeting with health experts, chaired by lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal, is scheduled for Tuesday. Sisodia will represent the government in the meeting as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal went into home isolation on Monday evening after experiencing mild fever and sore throat.“Tuesday’s meeting will help us (Delhi government) ascertain if Delhi has entered the community spread stage of Covid-19. Our entire strategy to deal with the pandemic may change with that,” Sisodia said.Later in the day, Jain said the current doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in Delhi is 14 days. So the national capital, as per that estimation, is likely to see over 56,000 cases by the end of the next two weeks.Jain cited the government’s health bulletin issued on Sunday – when the number of coronavirus cases in the national capital crossed the 28,000-mark with 1,282 fresh infections, while the death toll climbed to 812.“The expert committee, which was set up by us earlier, has said the doubling rate is 14-15 days and currently the city has recorded 28,936 cases in total. So by the end of the next two weeks, it is estimated to rise to 56,000,” the minister told reporters.The Delhi government has so far appointed two five-member expert committees for guiding government policy on Covid-19 management. While the first committee, headed by Dr S K Sarin, helps the government in multiple aspects, the second one, headed by Dr Mahesh Verma, is guiding the government specifically in its healthcare augmentation plan after the city recorded 1,000 fresh cases a day for the first time on May 28. The Delhi government has issued an order to constitute a district core team for containing the spread of Covid-19 in the four districts—North West, Central, West and North—where a surge in the number of cases is being reported.In the past one week, Delhi has recorded more than 1,200 fresh cases a day on average, health department records showed.Asked about the Delhi government’s decision on Sunday to reserve beds only for residents of the city, Jain said, “Delhi and Mumbai are big metro cities which are facing the brunt of the virus. A lot of outsiders come to these cities, and had flights been grounded earlier, the infection would not have spread so much. But given the situation now, when for the past several days, over 1,000 cases are being reported every day in Delhi, city residents would need more space in hospitals.”The government’s decision, however, was overturned by the L-G on Monday evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-suspects-community-spread-may-change-strategy-to-combat-pandemic/story-ihYiGYQ6uVVl0189gr7ldJ.html
09-06-2020||Delhi||Malls, restaurants back in business after 3 months, but most patrons keep away||Delhi’s popular malls and favourite eateries Monday opened its doors for business -- after remaining shut for nearly three months owing to the nationwide lockdown on account of Covid-19 -- albeit with a thin customer turnout.Some of the restaurants, which before the lockdown had a long wait list with patrons cooling their heels outside their doors for a table, on Monday were largely empty with only a few customers walking in. Most establishments were geared up to the challenge of functioning amid the pandemic but with precautions. Floor-markings to ensure social distancing graced most restaurants, while staff members were fully decked in masks, gloves, face shields and protective covering.Sarvana Bhavan, a much favoured chain specialising in south Indian food with two outlets in central Delhi’s Connaught Place, started its services Monday, with all its staff members wearing masks and gloves. Even though the management has planned to allow seating on alternate tables, the low number of customers ensured ample space among the few customers.“Usually by noon, we would have at least 25-30 people waiting outside for a table. For the first time since we opened in Delhi,we had an almost empty restaurant at lunchtime. These are peculiar times and, maybe, business will pick up in a few days,” Saravana Bhavan’s Janpath outlet manager said, without giving his name.Another popular eatery in south Delhi’s Defence Colony, the 30-year-old Swagath Restaurant, also threw open its doors to diners. Anil Verma, the restaurant’s operations head, said business was resumed taking all precautionary measures such as frequent sanitisation of dining area and rearrangement of the seating plan.“We are following all norms laid out by the government. The cutlery and aprons are thoroughly sanitised and we are ensuring a 1.5-metre distance between tables,” Verma said.In malls too, visitors had to go through an elaborate sanitisation and screening exercise before entry. In south Delhi’s Select Citywalk mall, apart from screening visitors for temperature, automated hand sanitising machines have been installed at all corners for use by shoppers. Foot pedals have been installed for dispensing the sanitising liquid, so that contact with the bottle is nil.Many high-end brands selling clothing, apparel, watches and perfumes, which were operating in smaller spaces, have made arrangements of dedicated entry and exit routes, and rules of not touching the items on sale. “All shops are open but we did not get many shoppers today (Monday),” said a mall official.Fifty-three-year-old Tarun Sakhiya, a resident of Saket, was seen walking around the Select Citywalk mall with his wife, both wearing face shields and masks. He said the mall was their favourite haunt before the Covid-19 pandemic struck and they were excited to see it open on Monday after a long gap.“There is definitely uncertainty and fear among everyone now, but we need to accept that this is how life will be with this new virus. Our children don’t stay with us and we have been cooped up inside our house for so long that we needed this outing,” Sakhiya said.In Vasant Kunj’s Ambiance Mall, the footfall picked up towards evening, with a few families and couples seen walking around.“We are taking all precautions and for how long can one stay home. Offices and public transport have started then what is the point keeping malls closed?” Anumegha Roy, a 26-year-old resident of Vasant Kunj Block B, said.Some shopping malls remained closed on Monday to make the arrangements mandated by the government. DLF Shopping Malls said they will reopen their gates in a phased manner through the week. “We will take this week to open up our malls across Delhi and NCR, in a phased manner. All arrangements will be made to ensure the safety of shoppers,” a statement by the DLF read. Some restaurants also stayed closed as their proprietors were uncertain of the effect of opening their doors to public, especially when the Covid-19 cases were at an all-time high. Several iconic eateries such as Old Delhi’s Karim’s and Moti Mahal, Connaught Place’s Embassy Restaurant and the United Coffee House, and Khan Market’s Big Chill, chose to remain closed for the time being.“There are so many things that are beyond our control now. We can sanitise our staff and clean our premises but the carelessness of one person can shut the business off again. We are trying to work out a plan and we will take a few days before resuming operations,” Sunil Malhotra of Embassy Restaurant said.Popular restaurants in hotspot Nizamuddin West, such as Ghalib Kebab Corner and Al Quresh Restaurant continued to provide only takeaway and home delivery services.The members of the National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) said more businesses are likely to open in the coming days.“Restaurants are working out the nitty-gritty of reopening. There is no use in hurrying with this,” Anurag Katriar, president, NRAI, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/malls-restaurants-back-in-business-after-3-months-but-most-patrons-keep-away/story-OxzvNyoQCdKh0UNY8fAYwN.html
09-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s worshippers follow social distancing norms to keep Covid-19 away||Places of worship opened in the national capital on Monday with a new set of new rules, measures and markers to ensure strict adherence to social distancing as the city has reported around 1,000 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) since May 28. At various places, devotees were being allowed in only after thermal screening. Separate entry and exit paths were made, markers were painted on the floor to guide people so that social distancing is observed. Even though people kept pouring in at several temples and gurdwaras across the city, no place of worship reported a massive gathering despite opening after a hiatus of nearly two and a half months.Neha Gupta, 28, who lives in East Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar, visited the Hanuman Mandir in Connaught Place on Monday. “Every year on my birthday, I would start my day by offering prayers at the Marghat Mandir at Kashmere Gate. But since it was not open today, we came to the Hanuman Mandir. It was the best gift that I could receive on this day,” said Gupta, who had come along with her husband.The temple, which otherwise sees long queues on select days of the week, had a few people coming in. The devotees had to cross through a sanitising tunnel to climb up the stairs to reach the main hall. The temple bells were covered with a cloth, the steel barriers before the deities where devotees would usually bow down. were also out of bound for the people.Actor-turned politician and former Delhi-BJP chief Manoj Tiwari also visited the temple on Monday. A video of a man dressed as lord Hanuman dancing outside the temple was also widely shared on the social media. Suresh Sharma, the temple mahant (main priest), said, “We had requested Ram Chandra, a devotee, who dresses up as the deity on every Hanuman Jayanti and does ‘seva’ at the temple to come down today, as the temple had opened after over two months. We have taken all precautions to maintain contactless praying. Not more than four people were allowed in at a time. We are expecting more people on Tuesday, an important day for the devotees of lord Hanuman.” At the nearby Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, placards hung across railings with messages urging people to maintain distance and use had sanitiser. The entry to the gurdwara was through a sanitising tunnel. Outside the main hall, the sevadars poured sanitiser on the hands of the devotees. The langar (community feast) services within the premises have been suspended for a while.Anuj Khanna, 33, used his lunch break to come down from his workplace nearby to visit the gurdwara. “I used to come here every Sunday. When I saw the news that places of worship are opening up, I couldn’t wait to come out to pray for my father, who has not been keeping well,” said Khanna.Gurpreet Singh Bicky, in-charge of the arrangements at Gurdwara Bangla Sahib, said, “We have deployed 60-70 sevadars all around the gurdwara to manage the devotees coming in and ensure that there is no violation of norms. Not many people came in today but we are prepared to deal with even larger numbers” Some of the institutions such as the Sacred Heart Cathedral in central Delhi and Akshardham Temple, among others, though remained shut.Shashi Toppo, 24, had come all the way in a bus from Najafgarh to pray at the Valenkanni Church at Khan Market. “I used to come to the church every Saturday. I didn’t want to wait till the end of the week and thought to offer prayers for my family,” she said. At the church, the candle lighting stand outside did not have any devotees, wooden benches were placed to maintain distance from the altar while the holy water was not being given.At Old Delhi’s Jama Masjid, prayers for only three times --- zuhr, asr and maghrib --- were opened for the public. People were not being allowed for the remaining two -- fajr and ishaa -- in view of the night curfew timings. While fajr is offered early in the morning (around 4.30am), ishaa is performed in the night (around 9pm). A team of police guarded the main entrance to the mosque. “The gates are opened only around the time of the namaz to avoid crowding. People are requested to come after doing wuzu (ablution) at home so that time could be saved. Upon entry, hand sanitiser is being administered. Devotees will now have to on alternate blocks on the floor. Around 150-200 people offered namaz on the first day,” said a person associated with the Shahi Imam’s office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/places-of-worship-with-rules-to-keep-covid-away/story-oYYx4MUeYNfbDPrbftnx0O.html
09-06-2020||Delhi||East Delhi municipality adds two more crematoriums for Covid-19 victims||The East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) on Monday dedicated two more of its crematoriums for bodies of victims of Covid-19 confirmed and suspected cases .Municipal officials said that the two new additional crematoriums assigned for Covid-19 cremations are the ones located in Seemapuri and Ghazipur. The move comes after North Delhi Municipal Corporation on Monday asked the east Delhi municipality to identify additional crematoriums for Covid-19 related bodies in its jurisdiction in order to reduce the load on Nigambodh Ghat.According to civic body officials, as many as 748 cremations of Covid-19 positive and suspected victims were conducted at Nigambodh Ghat between March 14 and June 7. Out of 748 funerals, 556 were done through CNG furnaces while 192 cremations were done on wood pyres .The request to east Delhi was made after north corporation standing committee chairman Jai Prakash, along with the civic body’s health department officials, conducted an inspection of Nigambodh Ghat crematorium, near Kashmere Gate, on Monday. The inspection was conducted after complaints of irregularities and delays in the cremation of Covid-19 bodies. Nigam Bodh Ghat crematorium is among the largest facilities designated for the funeral of bodies of victims that test positive for the virus in the city.Prakash said that due to the infection spreading rapidly, there was a lot of pressure on Nigambodh Ghat. “We have urged the east and south Delhi municipal corporations to ensure arrangements of additional cremation grounds in their jurisdiction. The east municipality has designated Gazipur and Seemapuri crematoriums for the purpose. This will reduce some pressure on Nigambodh Ghat,” Prakash said.North Corporation is the nodal agency looking after the cremation of bodies of Covid-19 positive and suspected cases.Till now, only Karkardooma cremation ground was designated for funeral of Covid-19 related bodies. But now with the addition of Ghazipur and Seemapuri, there will be at least three cremation grounds available in east Delhi.Civic officials said that with the inclusion of the two cremation grounds, the total number of Covid-19 dedicated crematoriums, burial ground and cemeteries in the city will stand at 13.Out of these, only Nigambodh Ghat and Punjabi Bagh crematoriums are equipped with CNG-based funeral facility. “Only wood pyre based funerals will be conducted at newly added Ghazipur and Seemapuri crematoriums,” a senior civic official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/east-delhi-municipality-adds-two-more-crematoriums-for-covid-19-victims/story-K3N4GhDI0riWEllxgUCf7O.html
09-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Jamia committee, ‘mob led by women’ among accused in cop’s murder case||The Delhi Police on Monday filed four chargesheets in cases related to the communal riots which took place in northeast Delhi in February this year, including for the murder of their head constable Rattan Lal. These are the first chargesheets to be filed in the four respective cases.In the chargesheet in the Rattan Lal murder case, the police have said: “the north-east riots were not impromptu but were conspired with an intent to create communal strife, to malign the image of the country under the garb of democratically opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA)”.“Investigation has revealed that the protest site (where Lal was killed) was managed by the Jamia Coordination Committee (JCC),” the police said in the above chargesheet.The JCC, meanwhile, denied all charges, saying the allegations are baseless. “These are concocted stories and baseless allegations levied by the police. The JCC was only looking after the Jamia protest site. Locals were running protests elsewhere in the capital and JCC had no involvement in it,” said a JCC member, requesting anonymity.The other three charge sheets were filed in two murder cases – of Shahid, 25, who was found dead on February 24 and Maruf Ali on February 25 – and one chargesheet was filed in Ajay Goswami’s attempt-to-murder case.With these four new ones, a total of 85 charge sheets were filed til Monday in a total of 752 cases pertaining to the communal riots.Head constable Rattan Lal’s murder caseAccording to the police, on February 24 a mob “led by women” allegedly attacked the police team, which was being led by deputy commissioner of police (Shahdara) Amit Kumar Sharma at Wazirpur Road in Chand Bagh, where a sit-in protest was being held since mid-January. The DCP was severely injured and had been recovering in a city hospital; He was discharged around April and joined duty only last month. The police stated in the chargesheet that on February 23, the protesters had attempted to take out “an illegal march” to Rajghat but were stopped by the police. Subsequently, they sat on the main Wazirabad Road and disrupted traffic for hours. “On the same night, a secret meeting was held and the people were directed to prepare and arm themselves for the next day,” the police have said in the chargesheet.Police said in the chargesheet that on February 24, DCP Sharma found one Salim Munna at Wazirabad Road, Chand Bagh making an inflammatory speech and tried to dissuade him. Suddenly, a mob led by women fiercely attacked the police party, it said. “The mob indulged in rioting, causing massive loss to public and private property, and attacking the police party. Head constable was shot dead while many police personnel....were critically injured,” the police have said in the chargesheet. During the same time, an investigator, asking not to be named, told HT that the rioters barged into the nearby Saptrishi building and resorted to “indiscriminate firing and stone pelting.”“Later, the body of one of the rioters Shahid, 25, was found with a gunshot injury on the rooftop of the building. The bullet had pierced his body in a downward direction, suggesting that he was shot by someone who was firing from the rooftop itself,” said the investigator, asking not to be named. According to senior officials of the crime branch privy to the prove, 17 people were arrested and have been charged in the head constable’s murder case, while six have been arrested and charged in Shahid’s murder case. Officials said they more people may be arrested and named in the supplementary chargesheet, depending on the further probeAccording to the chargesheet in the Rattan Lal case, “the sit-in protest was used as a springboard to propel riots.” The ensuing riots snowballed into fierce rioting in various pockets of the north-east district. Initially, one community remained aggressive on February 24, which was followed by violent reaction from the other community the next day, the statement said.The chargesheet in Rattan Lal murder case, running into 925 pages, mentioning 164 witnesses, was submitted before a duty magistrate in a Delhi court, which fixed June 22 as the next date of hearing in all the four cases.Ajay Goswami attempt-to-murder case: On February 25, a bullet hit Goswami on his back outside Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) councillor Tahir Hussain’s house, from the terrace of which many people were allegedly firing indiscriminately. Goswami named two people – Gulfam and Tanvir – as the prime suspects and they, along with six others, including Tahir Hussain and his brother Shah Alam, were arrested in the case.Police said in the charge sheet that in January, Hussain asked Gulfam to prepare for a “big riot” and also gave him Rs 15,000 to “purchase fresh ammunition” for his licensed weapon. Before his arrest, Hussain had denied the police’s allegations and said that he was a victim and not a suspect. He had said this was a political conspiracy. On January 31, Gulfam purchased 100 rounds and he already had about 100 rounds stored with him, the police statement added. “Gulfam fired most of the 200 rounds on February 25 at the other party. When he finished, only seven bullets had remained with him,” another officer associated with the probe, asking not to be named said, quoting the chargesheet.Hussain has already been charged in two other riots-cases, including the murder of Intelligence Bureau official Ankit Sharma.Police said they have also charged six persons for the murder of Maruf Ali on February 25. Ali was standing with his neighbour Shamshad in Subhash Mohalla, north Ghonda, when a mob raising slogans in support of CAA resorted to firing and stone pelting. Ali was shot dead while Shamshad suffered a gunshot wound in the abdomen.At least 53 persons died while 400 others were injured during the violence which rocked parts of northeast Delhi in February.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-jamia-committee-mob-led-by-women-among-accused-in-cop-s-murder-case/story-ISNjVwwG4p8Tn7Fjb2QHtN.html
09-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt backs power discoms’ demand for loan from the Centre||The Delhi government has written to the Union ministry of home affairs to grant loans worth Rs 6,350 crore to the three private distribution companies under the Centre’s special loan scheme for discoms. While the demand to get a share from the Centre’s Rs 90,000 crore package as loans was raised by the discoms, the Delhi government backed their request, stating that the liquidation money would help the government recover outstanding dues of Rs 15,595.27 crores - which the power distribution companies owe to the Delhi government’s generation firms. But to avail the Centre scheme, a state guarantee is required for the loan to be granted, which is not possible in Delhi’s case because it is a Union Territory. As per government documents, discom BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (BRPL) has sought a loan of Rs 3,050 crore, BSES Yamuna Power Ltd (BYPL) of Rs 2,300 crore and Tata Power Delhi Distribution Ltd of Rs 1000 crore. “Since Delhi can’t be a guarantor, we have requested the Centre to give the state guarantee on behalf of the Delhi government. The loan is strictly to pay off the dues of power generating and transmission companies. So, it will help clear the dues which discoms owe to the two power generating units IPGCL and PPCL, and the Delhi Transmission Limited, the transmission company - all owned by the Delhi government,” said a senior government official. In her letter to the MHA, Delhi’s power secretary Padmini Singhla wrote: “Due to power purchase costs and a significant drop in collection efficiencies from consumers following the Covid-19 outbreak, the sector will require liquidity infusion for sustenance. Delhi discoms have requested a loan from PFC under the proposed liquidity injection package of Rs 90,000 crores for meeting the liquidity crunch due to the impact of Covid-19.”Singhla’s letter also stated that the power distribution companies of Delhi “are one of the best performing companies” in the power sector with their aggregate technical and commercial (AT&C) losses below 12%. Delhi had successfully met an all time peak demand of 7409 MW in July, 2019, it stated. Till lockdown 3.0 that lasted for two months, industries, shops and other commercial activities were shut, which meant low electricity consumption and lower revenue for the discoms. These activities were allowed to open only in the fourth phase of the lockdown which started from May 18. On April 26, HT had reported that the first month of the lockdown had not only decreased Delhi’s daily average power demand by 35% over the previous year, but it also turned out to be a period with the lowest average electricity consumption in the Capital over the last 11 years at least. Delhi was among the first cities to impose a lockdown which came into effect from March 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-backs-power-discoms-demand-for-loan-from-the-centre/story-mv4BlZbZZKEZPWc5cqKFpN.html

The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) says action will be taken “soon”.“We are identifying societies facing these problems and soon action will be taken against all the vendors who are selling vegetables outside these societies,” said Madhav Jagtap, anti- encroachment department head, PMC“Since the last two-and-a-half months, we have allowed these people to do business. However, now, social distancing is not followed and we don’t know from which zones these people are coming. I want PMC to take quick action,” said Dilip Shinde, a resident of Pune-Satara road.“Our society will be giving them one more week as we don’t want them to suffer in lockdown financially, but from next week, we have planned to stop them completely. They can do their business somewhere else,” said Deepti Mirdhe, a resident of Shivshakti Society near Chavannagar Arch near Padmavati, who asked not to be named.“We have stopped trucks coming into our society. Trucks used to come on alternate days, like fruits one day, vegetables the next; but now, we visit shops outside our society,” said Abhishek Shah, a resident of Rohan Leher society, in Baner.Vendor speak“Selling vegetables near housing societies helps as we know how much quantity is to be carried from our homes. It avoids unnecessary wastage. I hope societies allow us to continue. Once the situation is normal, we will return to the wholesale markets,” said Santosh Patil, who sells vegetables at Shivshakti Society, near Chavannagar Arch, Padmavati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/lockdown-s-supply-kings-now-viewed-as-high-risk-vendors-pmc-says-will-act-soon/story-6lUWE6i79HY9idPCHLrrSK.html

09-06-2020||Pune||Private offices in Pune play it safe as 10% staff resumes work||Many private offices began buzzing with activity on Monday with the Maharashtra government allowing offices to function with 10 per cent staff under the second phase of the Covid-19 unlock strategy.There was a heavy rush of vehicles on the roads during the morning hours with cars and two wheelers headed to various private offices.In Vimannagar and Kharadi, snack centres and kiosks were seen getting back to business as people resumed work. However, the PMC patrol teams asked them to shut shop due to the increasing rush. Employees who attended office from 9am to 5.30 pm expressed that severe restrictions were in place unlike the open atmosphere in the past.Ashish Shahpure who works at an IT company in Yerawada said, “We had to undergo thermal screening before entering the building. Despite the virus being at large, employees reported to work as they fear they might lose their jobs. We believe that the working conditions will be relaxed in the days to come.” Shahpure returned to his residence in Baner at 6.30 pm.Makarand Patil, an administrative officer who works at a private broadband company at NIBM road said, “I came to attend the office after two-and-a-half months and things have changed completely. My office has kept strict anti Covid measures in place. Precautionary steps will help us tide over this crisis,” he said.MCCIA director general Prashant Girbane said he was happy that finally the economic activities were ramping up. He said every organisation must invest in an IEC (Information, Education and Communication) campaign to keep the employees aware and awakened to the risks from Covid-19.Milind Patange, vice-president, sales, VTP Realty, said while their construction activities and sales site offices were closed during the lockdown, with the relaxation, the sales site offices have started operations with minimum strength. “We are following all the government norms like mandatory use of masks, temperature checks of each and every employee, visitors and labourers at the main gate, he said.”Niharika Singh, a resident of Vishrantwadi, who works in a transport logistics firm in Lohegaon said, “I worked from 10 am to 5.30 pm.

Our office has also asked us to mandatorily download Arogya Setu app.”Nitin Kulkarni, chief operating officer at Harbinger Group said employees had slowly started resuming office. “While doing so, both companies and employees need to take care of a few things. Companies need to ensure that they have created the right infrastructure and processes to ensure physical distancing and hygiene. Employees must follow the rules laid down by the company in terms of physical distancing and personal hygiene. In the coming months, companies need to open up their offices in a gradual fashion and encourage remote working for as long as possible, ” he said.Private offices have been advised by the government to ensure that employees use the sanitisers on entering the office, conduct meetings with clients or vendors strictly on appointment basis; hold internal meetings while keeping the social distancing norms with just three-four members in the meeting room; have lunch on individual tables and not in a group. Handwash in the bathrooms, cleaning of washrooms and seating areas at regular intervals and sanitizers on every table have also been advised.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/private-offices-play-it-safe-as-10-staff-resume-work/story-CpkMvGK4TAjfeaeGmFtwkK.html

09-06-2020||Pune||As migrants leave, construction community to train, engage local youth from nearby areas in Pune||Now that the lockdown is opening up and to ensure building and construction work resumes the builder community is making all efforts to engage labourers and jobless youths from nearby areas in and around Pune.The exodus of the migrant workers began when the Shramik trains began their service. “More than 80 per cent of the construction workers left for their villages,” said Bharat Agarwal, committee member, National Real Estate Developments Council, (Naredco), Pune. “Up until then we did our best to keep them on our sites, providing them with food and daily necessities,” he added.“Though work hasn’t started in full force since we have to have all our raw materials ready and some suppliers are in areas where transportation is presently not possible, we are keen that we have our workforce ready,” said Agarwal.“When we witnessed this large exodus we realised that it is important to have our workers from nearby areas in Pune. To do that we have launched a training programme where we aim to train our rural youth in different skills like masonry, plumbing, electrician, among others,” said Agarwal.“In any case, we have been doing that over the years all over India. But now our focus is going to be on the men and women from in and around Pune,” he said. To recruit jobless youth from the villages around Pune Naredco has tied up with Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh that has a large network in a majority of the talukas in Maharashtra.Chandrakant (Anna) Dhumal, president, Bharatiya Mazdoor Sangh, Maharashtra, said, “We have always focused on the well being of our contractor workers and we have our presence in more than 70 per cent of all the talukas in Maharashtra as well as India. We have set up help desks in every taluka that aims to help them with legal and other issues that the members may have.”“When Naredco informed us of their intention we have now sent out a circular to all the help desks with their offer,” he said.“We think it’s a great idea since in my estimate every taluka has at least 5,000 to 10,000 youths who are jobless. We will put out this offer where they can get training in various constructions fields like electricians, plumbers, tiling, POP work among others and then get employed,” said Dhumal.“Our aim will be to find people who live close to the sites so that they can visit their homes easily during times of family crisis or in the two to three months of farming. But in case that is not possible then they can stay on-site,” he said.Despite the construction industry employing on contract workers that the Sangh is not in favour of, Dhumal feels that “They will at least learn a skill. And with that skill, they can find employment easily on other projects or even become entrepreneurs if they so choose. It is a good thing for our young men and women.”For Naredco this is a long term plan. Says Agarwal, “The training modules are from one month to three, but we are in no hurry as such. If we can get at least 40 per cent of our workers from near Pune we are happy. At least you don’t get stranded like we are now.”Credai to get back workers from hometownsAs construction activity chugs back to normal Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (Credai), Pune plans to get back their workers from their hometowns, even as the efforts to train local youth will begin. JP Shroff who heads Kushal (the wing that skills construction workers and is part of Skill India), said, “We have put out advertisements in the local papers soliciting young men and women from Pune to come train with us.”While that may take some time the builders will need immediate hands on the deck. “To do that we have initiated talks with our other chapters across the country like Credai Patna, Credai Bhubhaneshwar among others to see how they can help us bring back our workers. We are collaborating with them to see how many are willing to come back and what we need to do to help them return and give them a job guarantee,” said Shroff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-migrants-leave-construction-community-to-train-engage-local-youth-from-nearby-areas-in-pune/story-iQ3E5fR3rHsByl85BjprSJ.html
09-06-2020||Pune||No home isolation of Covid-positive patients in Pune, says PMC chief||Contrary to directives from the state and central governments, Pune will not allow Covid-19 positive patients to quarantine at home.Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) chief Shekhar Gaikwad, on Monday, said the civic body has enough facilities to house Covid-19 patients and therefore, positive patients will be admitted to these centres only.“The PMC has a bed capacity of 10,000 in the city. Though the total number of Covid-19 positive patients has reached 8000, the actual number of active patients taking treatment is 2,484. Even the medical and paramedical staff is enough. Considering this, PMC expects Covid-19 positive patients to take treatment at these centres,” Gaikwad said.A health department officer, speaking anonymously, said, “Of the Covid-19 positive patients, 90 per cent are from slum areas. It would not be possible to allow home isolation in slums. As far as Pune is concerned, there are enough beds and institutional isolation is better.”The central and state government guidelines state, individuals who test positive for Covid-19, but with mild or no symptoms can be isolated at home if appropriate facilities are available.As per these guidelines Covid-19 patients are to be admitted to hospitals in a three-tier treatment system, according to the symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-home-isolation-of-covid-positive-patients-in-pune-says-pmc-chief/story-8Xyr3GZYgRBrf6HZf200KP.html
09-06-2020||Pune||Monday Musings: Decline in active Covid-19 cases in Pune is heartening||At the end of last week, the total number of Covid-19 progressive positive cases in Pune stood at 7,722 and the number of deaths due to the disease at 372.From a series of five lockdowns which stretched for a little over two months, we are now in the midst of a phased unlocking. In the non-containment areas, people have stepped out for their morning and evening walks; all kinds of shops have opened up and there is a determined revival of economic activity. From this week onwards, people from Pune are likely to be allowed into the neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal areas where many people go to work in the industrial areas.All of this is bound to increase the number of positive cases and that is what the headlines are going to reflect, day in and day out. At the same time, there is some heartening news too.Also Watch | Maharashtra’s covid cases go past China’s total tally, over 7 million cases worldwide For a good 12 days, from May 25 to June 5, the number of active cases has hovered in the 2,100-2,400 range. Active cases refer to patients who have not recovered from the disease and are undergoing treatment.In fact, from a high of almost 80% active cases against overall positive cases as of April 28, the number of active cases has dropped to less than one-third as of June 5.Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) data indicates that on April 28, there were 1,057 active cases (79%) among a total of 1339 positive cases. As of June 5, the number of active cases was 2,402 (32%) in a total of 7,447 positive cases. Pune measures very well on this parameter as compared to the state and national figures. As against Pune’s 32.25% active cases, Maharashtra stands at 52.63% and the national average is 51.36% as of June 5. Although the number of positive cases is rising, the doubling of positive cases is now 15 days as against 11 days one month ago and about one week during April 16-24.The mortality rate as of May 8 had dropped from a high of 9 per cent to 5.8 and stood at 4.96 per cent as of June 5. This was a positive sign for Pune given that the fatality rate in Mumbai and Ahmedabad was much higher said data analyst Sahil Deo. As of June 6, the fatality rate in Gujarat stood at 6.2% and West Bengal, 5.2%.The other positive trend is the sharp decline in positive cases in Bhavani Peth ward which has slipped to the third position with 865 positive cases as of June 5, after being the worst-affected ward ever since the pandemic hit Pune. As of June 5, Dhole-Patil Road ward is now the worst-affected with 1,560 positive cases, followed by Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori with 935 cases and Kasba-Vishrambaugwada with 646 cases. In terms of active cases, Bhavani Peth’s performance has been still better, having gone far below to the 10th position with just 121 active cases as of June 5.These are heartening developments for Pune even as the situation demands greater focus on the worrisome hotspots. As Mission Begin Again gathers speed with further relaxation in the Covid-19 (coronavirus) restrictions on public movement, we will need to be extra vigilant in guarding ourselves against the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monday-musings-decline-in-active-covid-19-cases-in-pune-is-heartening/story-8LwrTBXVunLH2lRIixRkuN.html
