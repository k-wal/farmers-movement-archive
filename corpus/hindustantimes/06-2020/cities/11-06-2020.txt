11-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Mumbai infra projects worth ₹2.63L crore affected by lockdown’||As many as 794 projects worth ₹2.63 lakh crore have been affected owing to the pandemic-ensued lockdown in Mumbai, a survey by project-monitoring organization Projects Today shows. Of the 794, 73% were government projects, while 26% were private projects, majorly real-estate developments.Apart from Mumbai, the top cities where projects have been affected include 539 projects in Bengaluru (worth ₹1.06 lakh crore), 607 in Pune (worth ₹89 thousand crore), 117 in Nagpur (worth ₹88 thousand crore) and 87 in Nellore (worth ₹71 thousand crore). “Together the five cities account for 29.3% of the total projects under execution in 108 hotspot districts,” the report ‘Projects Scenario Post Covid-19’ notes.The state government has been undertaking a massive infrastructure overhaul in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) with the plan to build a 337-km Metro network, the 22-km Mumbai Trans Harbour Link, and the coastal road connecting south Mumbai to the western suburbs. However, the works were stopped following the lockdown, and the agencies have also been facing issues with migrant workers leaving the city.“Most projects will face an overrun of a minimum of six months. Labour shortage and the upcoming monsoon season will prove to be a big hurdle for most of the infrastructure projects to restart properly,” said Shashikant Hegde, CEO, Projects Today. The organisation has been monitoring 74,000 projects across India from the time of their announcement.The report also notes that Maharashtra tops the list in terms of ‘Covid-halted projects investment’, the state is followed by Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, and Gujarat.The organisation also conducted a survey of 233 architects, contractors, and consultants from 14 states and 30 cities in May. When asked about the hurdles these projects will face post-lockdown, 56.2% of the respondents said that finding the requisite number of labourers is going to be the biggest hurdle. Around 53% of the participants said that financing the projects will be a major hurdle. Apart from this, sourcing raw materials, arranging transport, and policy decisions will also affect the revival of projects, the responders said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-infra-projects-worth-2-63l-crore-affected-by-lockdown/story-TIinIU5RWi2rtiduhz1qmK.html
11-06-2020||City||Covid-19: Health dept recommends second containment zone in Amritsar||The health department has written to the district administration and recommended to declare second containment zone in Amritsar’s congested walled city, keeping in view the rapidly rise in community transmission of the coronavirus. The administration on June 8 had declared the first containment zone in Amritsar after the district crossed 500-mark cases. The areas of the walled city, including Katra Moti Ram, Ganj Di Mori, Katra Parja, Bombay Wala Khoo, Gali Kandha Wali and Katra Moti of Ram Bagh, were sealed in the first containment zone, after 19 community spread cases were reported from there.So far, the district has reported 542 cases, including 14 deaths. “It is difficult to maintain social-distancing norms in the congested and populated walled city lanes, most of which are less than 6-foot wide. A letter has been written to the administration to declare Phullan Wala Chowk, Katra Charat Singh, Katra Bhai Sant Singh, Tunda Talab, Katra Dullo and Shakti Nagar as containment zone,” said civil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore.Amritsar additional deputy commissioner Himanshu Aggarwal said, “We conducted a field survey in these areas and have asked the health department to reassess the situation. If these areas are found vulnerable, we will declare the second containment soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-health-dept-recommends-second-containment-zone-in-amritsar/story-HbFqLPImBl3pj6gc7vefDI.html
11-06-2020||Mumbai||1,422 cases daily: Mumbai’s average from June 3-10||In the past eight days, the number of Covid-19 cases in the city has gone up by 27% – an average of 1,422 cases daily. The city’s doubling rate (time taken for the number of cases to double, which is indicative of the spread) is 25 days, against the national average of 16.According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) data, 1,268 cases were reported in Mumbai on June 3. The day’s count on June 4 was 1,441; 1,146 on June 5; 1,256 on June 6; 1,397 on June 7; 1,317 on June 8 and 1,015 on June 9. June 10 saw a jump with 1,567 cases. According to the state health department, the number of cases on June 10 was 52,667.BMC’s data shows that earlier the cases were restricted to the containment zones, but now they are spreading through the city and suburbs. Between June 3 and June 9, wards namely P/N (Malad), R/S (Kandivli) and R/C (Borivli) have recorded a gradual rise in cases. Bharat Marathe, deputy municipal commissioner of zone 5 (ward L, M/E and M/W), said, “Earlier, the infection was limited only to a few wards, but in the past 45 days, it has spread to almost every ward. Borivli and Gorai, which recorded the lowest number of cases earlier, have more active cases now.”Till June 9, Borivli West, which includes Gorai, IC Colony and LIC Colony, had 912 active cases, just a little lower than G/S ward (Prabhadevi, Worli), which has 1,231 active cases and tops the list of total cases in the city (3,618 cases). R-C ward of Borivli West has 1,330 cases. P/N ward, which covers Malad, has more active cases (1,712) than the third-most affected L ward, comprising areas namely Kurla, Sakinaka and Chandivli. L ward has 3,258 cases, of which 1,608 are active. According to experts, the design of a pandemic is such that it spreads like tremors, just like an earthquake that starts from an epicentre. “The situation in areas of Dharavi and Koliwada, which recorded one of the highest cases, has come under control. Now the virus is spreading vertically. The cases are therefore still high,” said Anant Bhan, global health expert. For the first time since the outbreak of the virus in April, the doubling rate in E ward (Byculla) and F/N (Matunga) has improved to 50 days. The doubling time has improved in most of the containment zones in wards such as G/N, which includes areas like Dharavi, Dadar and Mahim.Dr Archana Patil, additional director, state health department, said relaxation in lockdown cannot be the sole reason for the rise in cases. “There can be several factors such as increase in testing capacity and better screening, among others. We are studying all reports before we can come to a conclusion.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/1-422-cases-daily-mumbai-s-average-from-june-3-10/story-liRsErCrzEnzKEUAkmueXJ.html

11-06-2020||Mumbai||No clarity on rules as schools tell teachers to report to work||In the absence of clear guidelines about attendance of teachers in schools across the state, several schools in the city are now asking teachers to report for duty.As per the amendments to easing of lockdown restrictions issued by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation on June 9, schools and other educational institutes can only function for “non-teaching purposes including the development of e-content, evaluation of answer sheets and declaration of results”.A circular issued by the finance department, which states that the salary bills of government employees would be drawn based on their attendance from June, has been quoted by the office of the education inspector, north region for schools in Mumbai.With no clear guidelines from the education department, private schools have already started calling teachers for various reasons such as conducting online classes, finishing online assessments, and other teaching-related work.“We have been asked to report to work, citing the guidelines on the creation of educational content, and have been asked to conduct online classes. The school has made no arrangements for travel and they have asked us to carry our own sanitisers,” said the teacher of a private school in Kandivli.Anil Bornare, coordinator of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) teachers’ cell, said several aided schools have also asked their teachers to report to work from June 15. “The government circular, which mandates people to attend office on a rotational basis, is being misinterpreted by schools, which are asking their staff to be present because they are government employees. Staffers live far from the school in most cases, and it becomes difficult for them to travel considering there are no trains, and buses are already crowded. The government should give clarity on the issue,” Bornare said.Officials from the state education department said that zone-wise guidelines for the functioning of schools would be issued soon. The state education department had earlier declared that while the new academic year would commence from June 15, it would not mean schools could reopen. Schools would only be allowed to teach online classes until they are allowed to reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-clarity-on-rules-as-schools-tell-teachers-to-report-to-work/story-RRjNUydhudjxyrGH7t04dL.html
11-06-2020||Mumbai||Metropolis Labs barred from conducting tests for 1 month||For the second time in less than two months, Metropolis Labs has been barred from carrying out tests for Covid-19 after complaints that it took longer than 24 hours to submit test results. It had previously been sent a show cause notice for the same reason in the third week of April.On June 9, Metropolis Labs was barred from conducting Covid-19 tests for a month. Additional civic commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “On Tuesday, we sent a notice to the lab prohibiting them from collection and testing samples for four weeks. We have found out that the lab on several occasions has delayed in providing the reports.” In April, Metropolis’s permit to test for Covid-19 had been suspended for a week. “Since they repeated the same mistake, we were forced to suspend them for a month,” said Kakani.Civic officials said delay in submitting reports leads to sudden spikes in the number of cases and deaths on certain days. Delays not only result in Covid-positive patients becoming eligible for treatment later, but also increase the chance of others being exposed to the virus. According to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) testing protocol, test results must be submitted within 24 hours of taking samples. At present, BMC is conducting approximately 5,000 tests for Covid-19 daily.A spokesperson for Metropolis said it had cleared its backlog. “As the largest lab chain in Maharashtra with the highest capacity for Covid-19 tests, our only aim is to serve the testing needs of the city and the state. We have also extended our offer to do tens of thousands of free tests for those who are unable to afford [tests] and are awaiting formal approval,” said the spokesperson.While civic officials have criticised private labs for taking two to three days to deliver results, the latter have said BMC is not holding civic-run labs to the same standards. “BMC is just blaming us for late submission. Have they checked the timing of their own labs? We are all overwhelmed and overstretched. Closing down labs, even temporarily, will only add to the pressure,” said an official from another private lab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/metropolis-labs-barred-from-conducting-tests-for-1-month/story-jfm9lKJzkx6ccPBgvsFH5I.html
11-06-2020||Mumbai||Parel society to set up in-house ICU and quarantine unit||A housing complex in Parel plans to set up its own isolation facilities and intensive care unit (ICU). Ashok Towers, comprising four high-rise buildings which house around 650 families, hopes to use empty flats in the complex as well as the club house and party hall in its premises to set up medical facilities for residents.Dr Nilesh Shah, a member of Ashok Towers’s managing committee, said, “We are in the process of identifying space for setting up facilities up to ICU beds in our club house and party hall, and are in the process of procuring necessary apparatus for the same. Ours is a private initiative that in a way supports the government as we become self-reliant this way.”The initiative has been taken by around 20 medical professionals who live in Ashok Towers. While they are yet to finalise their plans, they hope to accommodate five isolation beds and three beds in the ICU. These facilities will not cater to critically-ill patients, but are intended for asymptomatic carriers and those with mild cases of Covid-19. The housing society’s members said that if a resident tests positive for the virus, medical facilities on the premises will ease the burden on private and government hospitals.So far, four residents of Ashok Towers have contracted Covid-19. Of these, only one required hospitalisation. According to BMC’s data, more than 50% of those who test positive for Covid-19 are asymptomatic, and not more than 10% require hospitalisation.Shah said, “We are drafting our own standard operating process, and it will be implemented with the assistance of around 20-25 medical professionals from our housing complex. If there is any regulatory process with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), we will get it done in the coming days.”Residents are also planning to set up quarantine facilities in the empty flats in the housing complex, for patients with mild symptoms or the asymptomatic. ICU beds would be set up in the club house and party hall. Society members said they have procured oxygen cylinders, and are in the process of procuring beds, basic medicine for treatment and other equipment.Sarika Poddar, secretary of Ashok Towers, said, “We are also housing our essential staff (security, gardening) in our club house to ensure there is no commuting of outsiders in the society. We are also planning to allow house maids to work in few houses that require help, owing to them housing senior citizens. However, all housekeeping staff will reside in our club house where we are arranging accommodation, and will also have to quarantine themselves after entering the society and reporting to work.”On Wednesday, Congress legislator and Mumbai city guardian minister Aslam Shaikh requested BMC to give permission to housing societies to set up isolation facilities in clubhouses and recreational centres on their premises. Shaikh had said asymptomatic patients from the a society can be quarantined there instead of at Covid care centres. The BMC is yet to regulate on this issue.Non-availability of beds for Covid-19 patients has been a persistent concern for the BMC, particularly in the last two weeks. While BMC has set up war rooms for each of the 24 wards in the city to facilitate bed allotment, the civic body has also appealed that citizens who test positive should consult BMC’s health officer to figure out whether they can quarantine at home or need to be admitted to either an isolation facility or a hospital.As of June 9, around 75% of the beds for Covid-19 patients were full. Of the 17,835 available beds, around 13,390 beds were occupied. Of the beds in ICUs, 99% were occupied and 96% of ventilators were occupied.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a Mumbai-based health consultant with a private hospital, said, “Medically, there is no problem in having isolation or ICU beds facility in a housing society, if it benefits the both the government and citizens. However, there should be round-the-clock availability of a medical professional to ensure the health of the patient is monitored.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parel-society-to-set-up-in-house-icu-and-quarantine-unit/story-lrJSnYIDNpGlgXC6l4mMEN.html
11-06-2020||City||Beekeepers failed to recover cost this season on export suspension||With export of honey suspended due to global lockdown to contain the spread of covid-19, beekeepers or apiculturists have had a disastrous season so far. The bee production season for mustard nectar, the most valued one for export, starts from October and lasts till February. Jagtar Singh, 43, a beekeeper from Sangrur’s Kanjla village, said earlier this season, 25-tonne honey derived from mustard flower nectar found no exporters. Later, lower than usual temperatures for summer and the lockdown meant honey production reduced to half of the average of 15kg per bee colony. This major disruption to the business cycle has meant that beekeepers were unable to recover cost invested in bee colonies, which is between Rs 90 and Rs 100 per kg. Now, producers are incurring the cost of cold storage. “As lockdown caused by pandemic suspended export activities to the US, most beekeepers are forced to spend Rs 2 per kg for using cold stores. I have no option than to wait till November when licenced middlemen resume placing orders for the US and European markets,” he said.With an annual estimated production of 18,000 tonne, Punjab is the third-largest producer of honey. According to National Bee Board data, Punjab has 2.7 lakh bee colonies.President of Progressive Bee Keepers Association Narpinder Dhaliwal said of total honey produced in Punjab, about 80% is exported to the US. “Honey derived from mustard flower nectar has a creamy texture and its crystallised form has huge demand in the West. About 10,000 farmers are engaged in producing export-oriented honey. Owing to global restrictions, about 80% mustard honey could not be exported and it landed in the cold stores,” he said.During lockdown, most apiculturists were unable to take bee boxes to other places for nectar collection as villages did not allow entry. “It resulted in the death of bees and production saw a significant dip. Honey collected in April is consumed in the domestic market, but the lockdown hampered packing work. As apiculturists had the past unsold stock of mustard honey, they succumbed to market pressure to sell honey at a lower cost in April,” said Dhaliwal.Another beekeeper for over 15 years, Jatinder Singh, of Kandhargarh village in Sangrur, said the period between June to September is crucial for the survival of beekeepers after two failed seasons this season. Bees are to be fed with sugar starting July and most producers are short of money. “Early this year, beekeepers were paid Rs 98 per kg for mustard honey and farmers hoped for higher pricing later for their export-oriented product. The global lockdown crashed hopes and lower temperature for a prolonged period in April-May further led to reduced honey production,” he added.“The state government should assist us with providing subsidised sugar to feed bees and financial credit from banks to keep the business rolling. Bees are instrumental in pollination and strengthen ecological balance,” Jatinder claimed. Strap/BlurbFarmers forced to bear cost of cold storage, nectar collection also suffered during the lockdown; most hope for revival of export demand from November||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/beekeepers-failed-to-recover-cost-this-season-on-export-suspension/story-51fDO22wfmQJ0BLwWMVddM.html

Sukhbir said he had received messages from many youth that they were ready to pay for their air tickets, but there were thousands of workers who had spent their savings and were not in a position to afford return tickets. “Such persons should be rescued and naval ships can be dispatched to bring them back home,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/repatriate-20-000-punjabis-stranded-in-dubai-sukhbir-to-centre/story-zUg55ycIVzTuBVpVCZwO1H.html

Some persons were injured in the incident as blunt weapons were used by both the groups.A case of attempt to murder was registered by the police against some persons of Valmiki Samaj on the complaint of Satish Kumar. Later, the Valmikis submitted their complaint against the colony resident and his accomplices following which police had registered a cross-FIR without adding Section 307 (attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code.Few members of the Valmiki Samaj today met SP (headquarters) Gursewak Brar and alleged they were not satisfied with the probe conducted by the Phase 11 police.They also alleged that the police have not registered the case under Section 307 of the IPC against the colony president and his accomplices. They said that the police were under pressure as Satish had some political links.One of the protesters, Kuldeep Kumar said, “The police are conducting a one-sided probe in the case. If they can add Section 307 of the IPC against us, then why can’t the same section be added against Satish, who along with his accomplices had attacked our people and also threatened the community in the past couple of months.” He said that the colony president had also hurt their religious sentiments by making objectionable statements against the community.The protesters also alleged that Satish Kumar was having a criminal background and was also into the drug business. Phase 11 station house officer, Jagdeep Singh said, “We are not working under any kind of pressure. The inquiry of the matter was marked to the SP (headquarter). We are investigating the matter as per the complaints submitted by both the groups.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/valmiki-samaj-alleges-one-sided-probe-in-group-clash-incident/story-j82KoTzcQqV5CJxAlPov7J.html

According to police, Leena pinpointed location of the prime suspect, about 2km away from the scene of the crime. Her feat also saved four innocent persons, who were the initial suspects in the case, from further probe and prosecution.According to police, the deceased man, identified as Vivek Kumar, was a contractual employee with the electricity department and was returning home to Kushaliya locality under the jurisdiction of Masuri police station area when he was killed. Midway, his motorcycle had hit prime suspect, Mohsin alias Kauwa, and he along with two accomplices, Adil and Salman, ended up strangling the victim and stealing the motorcycle, Kumar’s phone and other belongings.“Leena was roped in to track the killers after Kumar’s body was found in the fields on the morning of June 1. The body had a belt tied around the neck, indicating strangulation. Leena picked up the scent of his attackers ran to a primary school where she started barking and scratching the gate of the school. We suspected that the suspect(s) had a connection to the school,” Neeraj Kumar Jadaun, superintendent of police (rural), said.Leena, police said, was specially trained at the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) facility in Uttarakhand and had joined a team of six other dogs of the Ghaziabad police about four months ago.“Our teams fanned out near the school and found that Mohsin’s house was about 50 metres from the school and they had visited the closed school to consume alcohol on the night of the murder. Upon further investigation, we found that Mohsin has previous criminal cases against him. Finally, our teams tracked the three suspects and arrested them on Thursday. The clues given by Leena helped out teams solve the murder case and the suspects were nabbed,” Jadaun said.As a reward for her work, Leena got a new strap leash, a bed and utensils, besides a special dinner.The police said Kumar’s family initially suspected role of his four friends in the murder, and they were picked up for questioning by the police. With Leena’s ‘investigation’, the four men were cleared of all further probe.Police said Kumar’s bike hit Mohsin who was sitting with two other accomplices. The three suspects allegedly robbed him of his belongings, before Kumar to death and leaving his body in the fields nearby.“The investigation concluded that the keys to the locked school was with Mohsin’s relative and the three suspects often came to the school during in the evenings to consume alcohol.

The ESIC hospitals are run under the auspices of Union ministry of labour and employment.According to the order issued by Deepak Malik, deputy director (medical administration) of the ESIC, Dr Anish Singhal, was transferred with ‘immediate effect’ from the post of director of the ESIC Hospital. “He has been posted to the ESIC directorate (Medical) in New Delhi. Dr Balraj Bhandar has been appointed as new director of the ESIC Hospital, Noida,” the order stated. Singhal will be relieved of his charge by Thursday afternoon.Based on the probe report into the death of the pregnant woman, Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY’s had sought the immediate transfer of ESIC hospital’s director, apart from action against doctors, an ambulance driver and other medical staff, who were all deemed guilty of denying treatment to the pregnant woman who died on Friday. On June 5, the ailing woman was taken by her husband and relative to as many as seven different government and private hospitals in the district and also a private hospital in Ghaziabad. But all hospitals refused to admit her and she eventually died the same evening at a government hospital in Greater Noida.Since the incident brought into focus the issue of medical negligence and unavailability of care even during a pandemic, the district administration had immediately constituted a two-member inquiry team, led by district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri, to investigate the matter. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), on Monday, had also issued a notice to the state government seeking details of action taken in the case.The probe team found gross negligence on the part of different government and private hospitals. It held liable the doctors who treated her and referred her, and the driver of the ambulance who dropped her outside the district hospital. The DM then wrote the government seeking the immediate transfer of the chief medical superintendent of the district hospital and the ESIC hopsital director.The report said private hospitals “made up excuses” of not having beds and turned her away, and held the staff and management guilty of negligence. The CMO has been told to issue show-cause notices to these hospitals and to lodge FIRs against them.Despite repeated attempts through calls and text messages, Dr Anish Singhal was unavailable for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/pregnant-woman-s-death-noida-esic-hospital-director-transferred-to-delhi/story-DZvVAa9qAVIIAp6DgpUgeO.html

Our doctors will take care of you. They will call you, send an ambulance and shift you to an isolation hospital/facility,” Suhas appealed through his official Twitter handle on Thursday.On the other hand, the Noida authority, on Thursday, divided the city into two blocks and appointed an engineer in charge of each area to carry out deep sanitisation of hot spot areas, to prevent the further spread of Covid-19.“These two officials will carry out deep sanitisation in all hot spots over the next three days,” Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer, Noida authority, said.There are at least 150 residential sectors, 81 villages and at least 50 industrial sectors in the city. In block 1, assistant project engineer Rajendra Prasad will oversee the exercise, while assistant project engineer BP Singh will oversee block 2. The GB Nagar district administration will hand over the fresh list of hot spots to the Noida authority.The two officials along with their teams will be equipped with fire tenders, ‘Covid 19 Vajr Vahan’, hand spray machines and another high pressure disinfectant machines. The exercise will involve the spraying of sodium hypochlorite solution on all common spaces in hot spots in order to disinfect these areas.There are 96 containment zones of Block 1 and 62 zones in block 2, the administration said.The DM further said at present despite having fewer than 250 patients, different Covid-19 dedicated facilities in the district has around 900 beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “Not only that, many private hospitals, including Fortis, Jaypee and Yatharth, have given their proposals to start exclusive Covid facilities at their hospitals.

11-06-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Govt has no plan to keep tabs on migrant labourers reaching Punjab||Even as hundreds of migrant labourers are arriving in Punjab everyday from Bihar and Uttar Pradesh for paddy transplantation, the state government has no plan in place to keep tabs on them to ensure they do not add to the state’s Covid-19 tally. Harinder Singh Lakhowal, president of a faction of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU), said 1.5 lakh farmhands have already reached the state and the number is likely to double in the coming days. “Queues of luxury buses in the state’s countryside is a common sight these days. Farmers are left with no option but to use their own resources for quarantine, food and medicines for the labourers. The government has failed to come up with anything concrete to help them on this. I myself arranged labour from UP for transplantation of paddy and got their basic tests done besides providing them an isolated place to stay,” said Lakhowal.As per an estimate of state agriculture department, nearly 10 lakh migrant labourers worked in Punjab during the previous paddy-sowing seasons. Now, the state has only 1 lakh farmhands who are engaged in potato harvest in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, SBS Nagar and Kapurthala districts. BS Rajewal, who heads another faction of BKU, said, “Farmers are left to fend for themselves. Now, they have to look after the health of the labourers in the middle of the pandemic.”To deal with the problem of labour crunch, the state agriculture department has asked the farmers to adopt direct seeding rice (DSR) technique. Paddy transplantation began in the state on a slow note on Wednesday due to the shortage of labour.Principal secretary (health) Anurag Aggarwal said 9,000 response teams working in the state to attend to those found symptomatic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-govt-has-no-plan-to-keep-tabs-on-migrant-labourers-reaching-punjab/story-VMOSKPdlNkjQ4on2TlS7sK.html

The penalty amount will be deposited in Rera account. Penalty was calculated at the rate of ₹1000 per day of delay,” said Balvinder Kumar, UP-Rera member and presiding officer, bench 2 at Rera’s Greater Noida office. “Further if amount of penalty and refund is not paid by December 31, 2020 we will issue recovery certificate against the promoter to recover the amount. District administration will then recover the amount from the promoter. The promoter’s property will be attached and bank accounts seized.”On January 31, 2019, the promoter was ordered to give possession to buyers by June 2019 alongwith delayed interest, failing which the buyers would have the right to claim refund.In August 2019 ,complainants approached the authority for execution of the order, following which Rera issued notices to promoter who promised to give possession by January 2020, which too it failed to do.On March 16, 2020 both parties appeared on hearing date. Promoter sought time to refund buyers’ money in instalments but did not give affidavit. Bench had then ordered refund in instalments and the first installment was to be paid by April 30, 2020 and the compliance date was on May 4, 2020. The promoter again did not comply with Bench orders. No compliance was submitted with regards to payment of 1st installment by the Promoter.Promoter’s advocate Manendra Kumar said, “We will challenge the order at higher appellate authority in Lucknow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-rera-fines-developer-93-lakh-for-not-executing-ts-order/story-M67byqwcxr6RzxgyY9C6rO.html

When the couple’s efforts to get themselves admitted to isolation facilities in government and private hospitals in Delhi proved futile, they contacted the officials at the central armed police forces (CAPF) referral hospital at the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) Lakhnawali camp at Greater Noida.

As many as 19 Covid-19 patients have died in the district, out of the 565 cases reported in the district so far. According to the district health department data, on Thursday the death rate of Ghaziabad stood at 3.36%. This is higher than Uttar Pradesh’s death rate which stood at 2.85%. As per the records made available by the state surveillance officer, as many as 345 Covid-19 patients have died in the state out of the 12,088 total cases reported until now.“Till the last week of May, there were only three Covid-19 related deaths in Ghaziabad, but there has been a sudden spike now in the deaths. Out of the 19 fatalities, eight Ghaziabad residents died at an L3 category hospital in Meerut, while one death each took place in Noida and Delhi. So far, eights deaths have taken place at our L3 category facility at Santosh Medical College and Hospital, after it started operations about 10-12 days ago,” said Dr NK Gupta, district chief medical officer (CMO).The L3 category hospitals were set up by the state government under its three-tier Covid-19 healthcare structure. Unlike the L1 and L2 hospitals that deal with asymptomatic or patients with mild Covid-19 symptoms, the L3 category hospitals deal with patients who need critical care.Officials did not elaborate on the deaths at Santosh Medical College.“The hospital was earlier a quarantine facility and was later converted to an L3 facility. Since this is a government acquired facility, only the Ghaziabad chief medical officer will be able to officially comment about any issue,” said Dr Manish Sabharwal, chief medical superintendent, Santosh Medical College and Hospital.Ghaziabad district magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey also refused to comment and referred the matter to the CMO.“The L3 facility at Santosh Medical College is managed by the hospital team and we cannot comment over the number of deaths that took place there. Out of 19 deaths, about 70-80% of patients had comorbidities. Most of them were senior citizens who had also developed complications due to acute respiratory distress syndrome. There were some cases where the patients suffered heart strokes as well,” the CMO said.However, the health department officials are yet to officially confirm whether the deaths were due to Covid-19.“We are waiting for the death audit reports of the deceased, and once they arrive we will be able to know whether the deaths were a result of the ailments the patients were already suffering or were they purely due to Covid-19. We expect that Covid-19 aggravated the comorbidities in patients, however, the death audit reports will conclude the exact cause of death,” Dr Gupta said.On April 15, the state health department officials had announced that audit of Covid-19 related deaths will be carried out and the medical reports of all the deceased will be studied by a panel of doctors.One of the firsts Covid-19 related deaths in the district included a 60-year-old woman from Vijay Nagar. She died on April 30 at a private hospital, and later her test reports found her Covid-19 positive. Doctors at the hospital had then said the death was a result of a heart stroke.“We are yet to know the exact reason behind my mother’s death apart from the source of her Covid-19 infection. She was suffering from blood pressure issues along with thyroid problems and was on medicines. Just two days before her death, we came to know that she also had diabetes. After my mother’s death, my entire family went under 14-day institutional quarantine and followed by seven-day home quarantine,” said the woman’s son.“How my mother contracted the infection is still a big question. The health department needs to expedite the audit of her death all Covid-19 related casualties,” he added.In Ghaziabad, deaths have been reported from Khoda, Pratap Vihar, Jhandapur, Vaishali, Behrampur, Sahibabad, Nandgram, Daulatpura, Vasundhara, Chiranjeev Vihar, and Indirapuram, said, officials.According to the health department data, Ghaziabad accounts for about 5.5% of the total Covid-19 related deaths in the state.Meanwhile, Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home) said the state has achieved the target of testing 15,000 samples per day, and the chief minister has directed the officials to now strive for testing 20,000 samples per day.“The CM has directed officials to focus on districts such as Agra, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar, Aligarh, Bulandshahr, Moradabad, Kanpur, Firozabad, Basti and Kanpur from where many Covid-19 deaths have been reported recently and also has asked the death audit reports to be expedited,” he added.State health department officials said they have also launched a week-long initiative to test the most vulnerable sections and those who provide essential services.“The week-long initiative will focus on certain groups such as those at old age homes, orphanages and juvenile homes etc, and will also cater to people engaged in the delivery of food, milk, and newspapers among others. People in urban slums, pharmacists, and helpdesk staff in hospitals will also be tested randomly under the initiative,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health).TWO DEATHS, 24 NEW COVID-19 CASESTwo more Covid-19 deaths were reported in the district, taking the death toll to 19. “A 75-year-old man from Modinagar died at Meerut, and 63-year-old man from Maliwara died at Santosh Medical Hospital in Ghaziabad,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.As many as 24 new Covid-19 cases were reported on Thursday in Ghaziabad. The district now has 565 cases. The new cases include three cases from Vaishali, one from Crossings Republik and two each from Kaushambi, Vaishali, Indirapuram and Vasundhara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-s-covid-19-death-rate-of-3-36-surpasses-state-average-of-2-85/story-xIvH8mCYlf2zaK9Ym6v2uK.html
11-06-2020||City||Markets in sealed Vaishali and Khoda localities allowed to open||Traders of Vaishali and Khoda finally heaved a sigh of relief on Thursday after district officials announced relaxations and allowed markets to open up in the twin localities. The Khoda and Vaishali localities had been placed under sealing on May 10 and June 1, respectively, to check the rising number of Covid-19 cases.Ever since the localities were placed under the ‘sector scheme’ as part of the sealing activity, the traders had been demanding that markets should open up. The district officials finally relented on Thursday and announced relaxations for the markets to open up in Vaishali and Khoda.“SOme restrictions have been eased in Vaishali and traders can open their shops on alternate days between 9am and 9pm as directed in the earlier orders. Strict social distancing norms will need to be observed. If they follow all rules, then relaxations will continue.However, the markets under containment zones will remain shut,” said Aditya Prajapati, sub-divisional magistrate.The traders’ association expressed happiness and requested all shopkeepers to shut by 8pm.“We have asked our members to shut shop by 8pm so that there is no violation of the 9pm to 9am curfew which is directed by the authorities. We have also asked them to take precautions and follow protocols as mandated. Our markets opened up for a couple of days earlier in May, but soon after Vaishali was placed under sealing. So our employees again suffered and all the stocks that we had purchased was going to waste,” said Anirudh Vashishtha, general secretary of Vaishali Udyog Vyapar Mandal.The residents of Vaishali said that opening of markets was a welcome sign and more relaxations should be provided later.“The markets have opened up and some barricades have been removed from internal roads as well. However, residents face restrictions in terms of moving in and out of Vaishali. Administration should consider this as we and restrict the sealing to containment zones only,” said Mohit Sharma, resident of sector-1.The district magistrate on May 22 had issued directions for opening of 34 markets across Ghaziabad city on alternate days.The major markets located in Indirapuram, Vaishali, Sahibabad, Bajaria, Gandhi Nagar, Nehru Nagar, Mohan Nagar, Shastri Nagar and Turab Nagar, among others, were directed to stay open on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.The market which were to open Monday, Wednesday and Friday were the ones located in Vasundhara, Kaushambi, Raj Nagar District Centre, Kavi Nagar, Rajendra Nagar, Shyam Park, Raj Nagar Extension, Navyug Market, Ambedkar Road and those in Delta Colonies of Ramprastha, Brij Vihar, Surya Nagar and Chander Nagar.the administration on Thursday, allowed some lockdown restrictions relief to 15 different markets in Khoda, that were allowed to open.“We have allowed opening of 15 different markets in Khoda. They will be open from 9am to 9pm on alternate days. Opening markets has been a demand from local traders since the lockdown began and thereafter since Khoda was placed under sealing. Each market has been given two days to open on alternate days on an experimental basis,” said KK Bhadana, executive officer of Khoda Nagar Palika.“During these four days, we will observe how traders and residents follow social distancing and safety protocols. If the response is favourable, the district magistrate will allow the relaxations to continue,” he added.According to officials, there are estimated 2,500-3,000 shops in Khoda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/markets-in-sealed-vaishali-and-khoda-localities-allowed-to-open/story-9A01QCizPNnDszI9sWh4HN.html

11-06-2020||City||Delhi’s home quarantine norms not applicable in Ghaziabad, says DM||The Ghaziabad district magistrate (DM) on Thursday ordered the district chief medical officer (CMO) to trace those Covid-19 patients discharged from private hospitals in Delhi but were quarantining themselves in their homes in Ghaziabad.Issuing the order, DM Ajay Sankar Pandey said such patients ought to be admitted to the Covid-19 facilities in the district.“We have come to know that asymptomatic patients get discharge slips from private hospitals in Delhi and are staying in home quarantine in Ghaziabad. This facility is available in Delhi but not in Ghaziabad which is part of Uttar Pradesh (UP). So, I have asked the CMO to track such patients and get them admitted in our Covid-19 hospitals. Such patients are a potential risk to others. Home quarantine of asymptomatic patients is not allowed in UP,” said Pandey. “If such patients follow Delhi norms, they should make arrangements for their stay in Delhi where such guidelines are applicable. They must also disclose if they are staying at home in Ghaziabad. If they fail to respond and we track them, legal action will be initiated.”Health department officials said that they did not currently have any data on such patients in home quarantine in Ghaziabad.According to Union ministry of health guidelines, those who have been clinically assigned as very mild/pre-symptomatic patients, may follow home isolation provided they have the facility for self-isolation and quarantining family contacts, inform the district surveillance officer of their health status and agree to an undertaking for self isolation. The ministry also prescribes a number of rules for caregivers of such patients.“The state government has not issued any guidelines in this regard. If any patient is found Covid-19 positive, he/she will have to get admitted to a Covid hospital. This is applicable in cases even if the patient is asymptomatic. On Wednesday we came to know from RWA members in Vaishali that an old aged man who is positive was staying at home for past eight days. So we got him admitted to our Covid hospital despite resistance by his family members,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.The DM also directed the stricter implementation of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) norms and directed officials that test reports from private laboratories should be streamlined.“We have found instances where patients come to know of the reports before the health department. There are instances where test reports of private laboratories are positive but turn negative when tested through government labs. In more instances, we come to know of positive patient only through local residents and there is no information given to health department. I have called for strict implementation of guidelines otherwise action will be initiated,” Pandey said.Paramount Symphony sealingNearly a week after a 43-year-old resident of Paramount Symphony, a high rise in Crossings Republik, was found to be Covid-19 positive on June 4, sealing action remained pending on Thursday.The magistrate had issued and pasted the sealing order on June 7. But the officials found themselves in a fix after they were informed that the patient was not there. The present sealing guidelines remain silent on what to do if the patient had left the society before the medical report is declared positive. However, the society is mentioned under category 1 containment zone in an order passed on June 9 and qualifies a tower that had the case to be sealed.“We were told by residents that the patient had not been in his flat since May 30 or 31. Later, we received a list from the health department of the areas which were to be sealed and the name of the highrise was not there. So we sought clarification from the district malaria officer (DMO) who is in-charge of deciding on the areas to be sealed, but there has been no response as of now. Hence, proceedings are pending,” said Prashant Tiwari, the sub divisional magistrate who is in-charge of sealing activities in Crossings Republik.DMO GK Mishra said that he had information that the patient had left the high rise even before his test returned positive from a private laboratory.“His family also left the flat. This is why we were not inclined to seal the tower. But we have no specific guidelines on how many days after a patient leaves his house should the area be sealed. It is then left to the judicious decision of the magistrate. In order to authenticate whether the patient was present in his flat or not, help from police surveillance will be taken up,” he added.“In case the patient was present in his flat during the time his positive report came, we will take legal action against residents and even lodge an FIR for misleading officials during the work,” said Tiwari.The highrise has about 1100 flats and the resident who tested positive was a contact of a positive patient.Kshitij Singhal, one of the residents of the tower, said that residents came to know about the patient only on June 7.“When we called him he told that he has left his flat so that no other family member of his family catches the infection. It is now up to the administration to take a call,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-s-home-quarantine-norms-not-applicable-in-ghaziabad-says-dm/story-H3zatssHesWP7rq1uv9HKO.html
11-06-2020||Noida||SC order to reduce interest rate on land dues a setback for Noida, Greater Noida authorities||The Supreme Court order that the Noida and Greater Noida authorities should charge only 8% interest on default payments of housing land dues instead of the existing 15-23% will negatively affect their financial health, said officials of the two industrial bodies, reacting on the Wednesday order of the apex court. The landmark order, however, has made real estate developers happy as it would considerably lessen their debt burden. The real estate sector in Delhi-NCR has been reeling under huge financial pressure due to the economic slowdown and the losses incurred due to the imposition of the national lockdown to stop the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The Noida and the Greater Noida authorities, which together need to recover a sum of at least ₹30,000 crore in housing land dues from the developers, will have to bear huge financial losses if this SC directive, which capped the interest rate at 8%, is implemented. The SC order came after a Noida-based developer, ACE Group of companies, filed a petition, arguing that, if as per the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) revised by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), the interest rate has been capped at 7-8%, then why are the Noida and Greater Noida authorities still charging exorbitant interest rates on outstanding of financial dues.Reacting to the order, the chief executive officer of Noida Authority, Ritu Maheshwari , said, “We are seeking a legal opinion about the Supreme Court order.” The Noida authority spends around ₹2,000 crore annually on the maintenance of civic services. After this order is implemented, the civic amenities may be severely impacted as the authority will face huge monetary losses, said Maheshwari.The other industrial body of the area, the Greater Noida authority, said that the authority owes ₹7,000 crore in debt from different institutions. The SC order will pose a huge financial challenge for the authority to deal with. The Greater Noida authority, which spends at least ₹1,000 crore on civic amenities annually, may be affected as the revenue collection from the developers will come down drastically after the implementation of this order.“We have asked our legal department to examine the order so that the further course of action can be decided,” said Narendra Bhooshan, CEO, Greater Noida authority.The two authorities have allotted housing land after accepting 10% of the total land cost. The developers are supposed to pay the remaining 90% of the land cost in instalments. The two authorities are supposed to charge 11% interest rate on land dues. In case a developer fails to repay his land due instalments on time then the two authorities have been mandated to increase the interest rate. In cases, where the developer repeatedly defaults on payment of land dues, the rate of interest can go up as high as 23% and can keep on increasing.The ACE Group, in its petition, argued that the Noida authority is demanding an additional charge of ₹600 per square metre, while the Greater Noida authority is demanding an additional charge of ₹1,700 per square metre in order to repay the additional compensation to farmers for the plots alloted between 2010 to 2015. It said that due to recession, homebuyers could not pay up the extra cost and thus they are unable to bear the additional financial burden the high rate of interest.Meanwhile, Noida- and Greater Noida-based developers welcomed the order, saying that it revive the stalled housing projects, which were facing financial issues.“The order will help the market to pick up. The basic problem was that the exorbitant rate of interest made most of the projects economically unviable. As a result, no bank was ready to fund these projects. Once the order is implemented, it will revive the real estate sector and many stalled projects will be delivered to homebuyers,” said Getambar Anand, ex-national president of Confederation of Real Estate Developers Association of India (CREDAI), a builders group.The developers also said that two authorities will now restructure their outstanding of the land dues.“Once the Noida and Greater Noida authorities restructure their land cost dues and reduce the same it will make most of the stuck realty projects viable. It will help the developers to seek funding from banks and it will help the developers to deliver at least 1 lakh flats soon,” said RK Arora, president (Uttar Pradesh) of the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), a realtors group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/sc-order-to-reduce-interest-rate-on-land-dues-a-setback-for-noida-greater-noida-authorities/story-hb0TFzJMMup64eJPh6W7zO.html
11-06-2020||Noida||Weighed down by huge overheads, gym owners explore options to survive||After remaining shut for nearly three months now, gymnasiums in Noida are battling for survival with owners renegotiating rentals with landlords and exploring revenue-sharing models even as Covid-19 is bound to keep their members away art least for the near future.Gym owners and managers are contemplating a change in business models and are chalking out new plans such as online training modules, and fitness trainer services at doorstep, among others, to survive in a post-lockdown time.Health officials said gyms were among the first to be shut to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and they will be among the last to be permitted by the government. Gyms in Noida have been shut since on March 15, at least 10 days before the nationwide lockdown kicked in on March 25.According to World Health Organization experts, gyms are hot spots of Covid-19 infection as a large number of people use the same machines, weights, and other exercise paraphernalia.Gym users also constantly touching their face, water bottles and face towels, which invariably increases the risk of an infection spread. No matter how many times the gym administration sanitises the place, the chances of an infection are higher in the closed space environment.In such a scenario, gym owners are looking to the government for help, stating that even though their establishments were closed over the past three months, they still had to shell out ₹25,000-50,000 a month on fixed overheads, not to mention rents that vary from ₹1-5 lakh, depending on the location and exclusivity of the gym. “Currently, the major issues we face is that we pay ₹4.25 lakh as rent every month, which we are trying to negotiate down with the landlord. We had been paying salaries to our staff and are in touch with our clients who wish to join back soon. We are also in touch with a few vendors to procure face shields and glass partitions between machines to ensure safety of users. But unless the rent is brought down, we may be forced to close,” Deepa Ahuja, who owns Anytime Fitness – an American Fitness chain, in Sector 108, said.Anytime Fitness owns 100 centres across the country, of which nearly 40 are located in Delhi-NCR and four in Noida.“The landlords expect us to pay full rents, irrespective of whether we have business or not. Even after the government allows us to reopen, we will get fewer clients. So the minimum support we seek from our landlord, after opening, is a 30-50% reduction in rent or a revenue-sharing agreement. If the landlord persists in claiming the full rent, we might not open at all,” Ankur Arora, owner and founder, La Fitness, Sector 18, said.The central government, in an order on May 30, had said a decision on the reopening of gymnasiums and swimming pools shall be taken in the “third phase” of the Unlock1 plan. Although there is no time limit specified for the third phase, it cannot take place before July as state governments are yet to decide on the second phase, which includes the opening of schools and colleges.According to the officials, there are about 400 gyms in Gautam Budh Nagar.“They can operate once the district administration gives a go-ahead. But my department’s main priority would be to ensure that proper precautions are taken to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. Nothing is more important than human life,” Poonam Bishnoi, district sports officer, said.However, the gym owners say while they are all set protocols and precautionary measures to ensure safety of clients, it’s their own existence that’s currently at stake.According to the managing director of Anytime Fitness, the fitness chain is witnessing a revenue loss of ₹15 lakh per month per centre.“We desperately need relief from the government and landlords, because the rentals are a major chuck of our monthly fixed charges. Gym owners also had to pay the electricity charges varying from ₹25,000-50,000 even for the period when the gyms are closed. If the rentals are not revised, about 40% of all gyms will close and at least 50 families per centre will suffer a livelihood loss,” Vikas Jain, managing director, Anytime Fitness, said.Ranjan Ghosh, senior regional manager, Gold’s Gym, who operates a branch in Noida’s Sector 30, said after resuming operations the fitness chain anticipates a direct loss of 35% .Gold’s Gym is an American fitness chain with around 150 gyms across 94 Indian cities. In Delhi-NCR, Gold Gyms has 18 centres of which two are in Noida. “Even if we open around August, going by the trends seen at our branches in Mongolia and Egypt, where gyms have opened again, we expect an approximately 35% revenue loss,” Ghosh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/weighed-down-by-huge-overheads-gym-owners-explore-options-to-survive/story-4KVTDi8NVzUQ4MMTHCqiuN.html
11-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi heading towards being ‘corona capital’ of India: HC on spike in Covid-19 cases||The national capital is fast heading towards becoming the “corona capital” of the country, observed the Delhi High Court while expressing concern over the spike in Covid-19 cases and directed that all private hospitals equipped with labs to test for coronavirus and having ICMR sanction be permitted to conduct the test. A bench of Justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad observed that “corona capital” was “an epithet the city can well do without” and said it was need of the hour that all private hospitals equipped with labs to test for Covid-19 be permitted to do so without losing any more time. According to latest official figures, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi is over 32,000 including 984 deaths. The number of active coronavirus patients in the city is over 19,000. The bench made the observation after it was told by the petitioner that several private hospitals, including Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, have been prevented from carrying out Covid-19 tests.The Delhi government, represented by its additional standing counsel Satyakam, opposed the submission, saying 23 private labs have been allowed to conduct the tests apart from 17 public sector labs. The bench, thereafter, issued notice to the 23 private labs, mentioned by Delhi government in its affidavit, and asked them to file their replies clarifying whether they have been permitted to undertake tests for suspected Covid-19 patients and by which technique.“They shall also point out the difficulties, if any, faced by them on account of any bureaucratic red-tapeism,” the bench said. It also noted in its order that non-Covid patients, who are approaching private hospitals for admission to undergo emergent surgeries and other such procedures, are not admitted without a coronavirus test for which they are compelled to go elsewhere.“It is most unfortunate that non-Covid patients are being made to wait to undergo test for Covid-19 at labs other than those which are situated within the premises of the hospitals, that are equipped and authorised to conduct the said test,” the bench said.The high court directed that all the private hospitals that have been called upon to reserve 20 per cent beds for admitting Covid-19 patients, are equipped with labs to conduct coronavirus test and have sanction of ICMR to do so, “should proceed to conduct tests on symptomatic and asymptomatic persons, who seek admission in the hospital for undergoing surgeries and procedures of other nature as well”.It also impleaded Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) in the matter so that details of private hospitals authorised by it to undertake Covid-19 tests can be furnished to the court on the next date, June 18.The high court said that ICMR while filing its status report shall also indicate number of applications submitted by accredited labs in Delhi seeking permission to conduct Covid-19 test and the status of the same.The order came on the application by advocate Sanjeev Sharma who has contended there have been several instances where non-Covid patients needing surgery or emergent procedures are required to undergo testing before that, but hospital concerned is unable to conduct the test as they are not permitted to do so by Delhi government.The application, filed through advocate Rakesh Malhotra, has also sought a direction to the Delhi government and all the hospitals and nursing homes permitted to treat Covid-19 cases to daily publish on their respective websites the status of vacancy of beds so that patients need not run from pillar to post for the same. The application was filed in the main petition, by Malhotra, which had sought swift testing of Covid-19 cases and declaration of results within 48 hours.The high court had on May 4 disposed of the petition with a direction to the Delhi government to publish on their websites correct data of tests conducted, number of positive results and pending outcomes.The application has alleged that the high court’s May 4 direction was not being complied with properly by the Delhi government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-heading-towards-being-corona-capital-of-india-hc-on-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-HYHYWoqYxiNnct9q90K5TL.html
11-06-2020||City||For street food vendors in Nida, it isn’t business as usual||Noida: Though Sarita’s family of five was hoping to get back to their village in Bihar, they decided to stay put in Noida when one of her sons found a job at a local grocery store, thinking his salary would see them through till the time they got their two street vends back up and running. Their hopes of going back to business as usual, however, were not met.“Once the restrictions were lifted, we restarted our tea vend at the Sector 18 market. However, business has been very slow. Barely 10-15 customers come in and we are not earning even close to what our income was earlier,” said Sarita, who lives in the Atta market area.All family members used to run the roadside shop together but they are letting their son continue working at the grocery shop for the additional income.There are myriad street-food vendors Sarita across the district who are struggling to make ends meet as despite relaxations and being allowed to resume work last month itself, business has not been not picking up for them due to lesser footfall.When the national lockdown had first been announced from March 25, street vendors had lost their livelihood. Some of them being migrants had wanted to go back to their home states but the hope of getting back to selling their wares soon enough had kept them from going.Some vendors, meanwhile, say they have simply not opened up their shops as they know they will not have enough customers to keep the business running.“We had two outlets next to each other. From one we used to sell streetfoods like golgappe, chaat, samosas and even momos. From the other we sold basic vegetables. Once the lockdown rolled about, we knew that the demand for fruits and vegetables would go up and that is what we are continuing with even now. Our street food vend has been put on hold for at least another month or so. We know that there will not be enough customers. Hardly one person comes by asking when we will resume selling snacks. So it doesn’t seem worth the effort for now,” said a vendor in Sector 75, asking not to be named.For others, there is no option but to forge ahead despite the reduced clientele.“The last two months were very difficult. My brother works as an auto-rickshaw driver while I run a momo stall. We both lost our livelihood and could barely scrap by depending on residents of nearby societies for help with basic necessities. Though we are both back to work, the situation hasn’t changed much. People no longer want to eat outside food. Very few people come over and most of them just get it packed to take it home. It doesn’t matter that I ensure proper hygiene is maintained. People are simply scared of eating out. No one shop is faring well,” said Naresh, who runs a vend at the Sector 76 market.Footfall is proving to be a problem not only for street food vendors but markets and malls as well, as people are scared of venturing out unless absolutely necessary.“I want to go and enjoy all the foods and snacks that I used to eat two months earlier. But it just doesn’t seem worth the effort anymore when even stepping out of the house is an achievement in itself. Maybe the situation will change in a few months when the pandemic starts to subside and we know that every seller is ensuring proper hygiene and sanitisation measures,” said Ritika Singh, a resident of Sector 75.India had first gone on lockdown from March 25 and is currently in the first phase of the Unlock when most activities, except those in containment zones, have resumed, albeit with precautionary measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-street-food-vendors-in-nida-it-isn-t-business-as-usual/story-Tr1BTYSY9WckklbsPEgb9J.html
11-06-2020||Delhi||Three held for attack on Inderlok police post, several cops injured||Three men were arrested after they, along with four others, barged into the Inderlok police post in north Delhi on Wednesday night and attacked with sticks and rods the policemen present there.Police said one of the men also opened fire at the police personnel, but no one was injured. The in-charge of the police post was rushed to the hospital after sustaining injuries on his head. A few others sustained minor injuries, senior police officers said on Thursday. The arrested men have been charged with attempt to murder, among other offences. Narrating the sequence of events, police said that around 8.30pm, a man named Mohammed Akhlaq, who runs a bakery in Inderlok, came to the police post and complained against one Sadaqeen, the son of the land owner of his bakery, and two others. Akhlaq said the three tried to take away some of his bakery items and when he resisted they assaulted him.“On this, the personnel from the police post went to the suspect’s house and brought Sadaqeen and two others to the post for further questioning. After some time, all three were allowed to go and they left. But they later returned with three to four more men armed with sticks, rods and pistols,” a senior officer, who did not wish to be named, said. The officer said the men attacked the police personnel and threatened them for detaining Sadaqeen. “During this, one of the persons, later identified as Naved, opened fire at the police team, but the bullet did not hit anyone. At least four others were pelting stones on policemen from outside,” the officer said.To disperse the attackers, the police post in-charge sub inspector Pankaj Thakran fired two rounds with his service pistol.“The attackers then tried to flee, but the policemen managed to catch three of them, including Sadaqeen and his two aides Ashiqeen and Shahrukh. Naved, who had opened fired, however, managed to escape with five to six others,” the above mentioned officer said. A CCTV footage of the incident, showing the men attacking the policemen was also widely shared on social media on Thursday. Although HT cannot independently verify the authenticity of the video clip circulating on social media, the CCTV video shows two men entering the police post. They are followed by four others. The group starts attacking the police personnel outside the compound. As a clash breaks out, some more men can be spotted attacking the policemen with sticks and throwing stones at them. The clip also shows the attackers running away as the policemen chase and catch two of them.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj said they have identified the remaining suspects and efforts to arrest them are under way. “The arrested men have been charged with attempt to murder and under other relevant sections of the IPC,” Bhardwaj said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/three-held-for-attack-on-inderlok-police-post-several-cops-injured/story-aT8DyHtoLKhiTjC4gmjsbK.html
11-06-2020||Chandigarh||Four dists continue to remain Punjab’s pandemic hotbeds||The Amritsar, Ludhiana, Jalandhar and Pathankot districts continue to remain Punjab’s Covid-19 hotbeds, with the four reporting a lion’s share of the total confirmed cases in the state in the last two weeks.An analysis of the data available with the state health and family welfare department reveals that the four districts witnessed the maximum rise in cases since June 1 while the number of infections in Pathankot got more than double since.Of the total 624 cases in the state since June 1, as many as 387 were reported in these four districts. With an average 14 cases a day since June 1, Amritsar, which is already on top of the chart of total cases, has witnessed the majority of fresh cases at 152. The district has topped the state’s tally of infections for over one-and-a-half-months since a large numbers of Nanded-returned pilgrims were tested positive.Amritsar is followed by the state’s industrial hub, Ludhiana, which reported 102 cases during the same period.In terms of the total number of cases, Jalandhar continues to remain on the second spot with 71 infections since June 1.ACCOUNT FOR 68% OF ACTIVE CASES Of a total of 569 active cases in Punjab at present, Amritsar, Jalandahar, Ludhiana and Pathankot account for 68% infections at 160, 59, 111 and 57, respectively.Interestingly, the SBS Nagar and Mohali districts which stayed on the top of the chart of positive cases initially, have succeeded in flattening the Covid-19 curve. Since June 1, SBS Nagar recorded only 10 cases whereas SAS Nagar registered 29 fresh infections.Punjab health department’s Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “Violation of social-distancing norms has been the main reason behind the surge in cases. In the past 15 days, we have come across many instances wherein a positive patient infected 10-15 persons.”“Another reason behind the spike in cases is their early detection. Around 200 cases in the past 10 days are those wherein patients came from abroad or from outside the state. Also, a significant increase in testing in the last 10 days is also showing a surge. Today, we conducted a record 9,000 tests in a single day,” he added.The department has conducted 66,646 tests this month so far.14 DEATHS IN LAST 11 DAYSAs many as 14 infected persons have died in Punjab since June 1 even as the state continues to have one of the best mortality rates in the country. But health officials say in all these cases the patients were having serious co-morbidities and were aged above 60.The department also declines community spread in any part of the state.“In districts where cases are increasing in a large number, we are going to increase targeted testing to check if there is community spread,” said the nodal officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/four-dists-continue-to-remain-punjab-s-pandemic-hotbeds/story-9Quo3xzZgMT0Hn85dyJi4M.html
11-06-2020||Delhi||MCDs offer community centres, stadiums to govt for setting up Covid-19 treatment facilities||Owing to the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the city, the three municipal corporations of Delhi on Thursday offered the Delhi government all community centres, stadiums and other properties under their jurisdictions for setting up temporary hospitals to treat patients. In a joint press conference, the political representatives of the East, North and South Delhi municipal corporations said that the civic bodies are ready to “handover” their hospitals to the government for use as Covid-19 dedicated facilities.There are nearly 119 community centres, four stadiums and four sports complex under the North corporation. Hindu Rao is one of the largest hospitals in North Delhi with a 980-bed capacity. Kasturba Hospital has a 450-bed capacity.There are around 100 community centres under the South corporation, while the East corporation representatives also offered to “handover” its Swami Dayanand hospital and all 71 community centres to deal with Covid-19 pandemic.Jai Prakash, the standing committee chairperson at North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that it is a time to defeat coronavirus, for which the municipalities and the Delhi government will have to work in “close coordination”.“We are ready to give our hospitals, such as Hindu Rao and Kasturba Gandhi, to the government so that these could be developed as Covid-19 dedicated facilities and better treatment could be provided. Similarly, we are requesting the state government to use our community centres and stadiums for creation of temporary hospitals and isolation wards to fight the coronavirus pandemic,” he said.Bhupendra Gupta, the South corporation’s standing committee chairperson, said that the government in April had dedicated the civic body’s Tilak Nagar super-speciality hospital as a Covid-19 dedicated facility, where six coronavirus patients being treated at present. “If the government wants, it can make our 100-bedded hospital at Kalkaji a Covid-19 dedicated facility. We are also offering all our community centres to be converted into isolation wards to meet the demand. We want to support the government, but they will have to provide resources,” Gupta said.“Delhi’s private hospitals are charging arbitrary amounts from Covid-19 patients as their beds are full. The state government is saying that they need more spaces to create temporary hospitals and isolation wards, so we are offering them all our community centres for the same. If they want, they can also declare Swami Dayanand Hospital as a Covid-19 dedicated facility so that better treatment can be provided to the Covid-19 patients,” Anju Kamalkant, mayor of the East corporation, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mcds-offer-community-centres-stadiums-to-govt-for-setting-up-covid-19-treatment-facilities/story-YYXXmPqT0P9FgVjfyKkv0O.html
11-06-2020||Chandigarh||COMMUNITY SPREAD FEARS: Stricter curbs imposed on weekends, holidays in Punjab||Amid apprehensions of community spread of Covid-19 and projections indicating that the pandemic peak in Punjab was two months away, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Thursday ordered stricter lockdown on the weekends and public holidays, with movement to be restricted to e-passes holders.“All citizens, except medical staff and essential service providers, will be required to download e-passes from the COVA app,” Amarinder directed at a video conference meeting to review the pandemic situation and the state’s preparedness to handle the further spread. Industry will be allowed to function normally on all days, though. The CM’s directions came even as the doubling rate in the state worsened from 22 on May 31 to 15 on June 10, showing a progressive decline day by day.Directing director general of police (DGP) Dinkar Gupta to ensure strict implementation of these directives to prevent gathering of large crowds, the CM said such tough measures were necessitated on account of the spiralling Covid-19 cases across the world. He said stringent curbs could help delay the peak for as long as possible.The CM also asked medical and health experts to consider imposition of strict conditions, including mandatory testing certification, for entrants from Delhi, where the situation had assumed alarming proportions. On an average, 500-800 vehicles are coming to Punjab from the national capital every day, the DGP informed the meeting. A decision on stricter curbs on those coming from Delhi will be taken after a review by the experts, an official spokesperson said after the meeting.Pointing out that many of those who had come from outside had behaved irresponsibly and had not reported to the health authorities, Amarinder said tough measures would have to be taken where needed, as the spike was still continuing and was expected to escalate in the days ahead.The CM suggested that since it normally takes 3-4 days for the virus to show up, those coming from outside should be tested after a week and in the meantime, they should be strictly asked to home quarantine themselves. The DGP was directed to ensure strict implementation of the home quarantine.Referring to complaints received on social media, and through other channels, of private hospitals charging exorbitant sums for Covid hospitalisation and care, Amarinder directed the health department to ensure strict application of CGHS rates. All data on availability of beds etc should be put in public domain, he said, adding that there was no scope for complacency in the state’s battle against Covid.He said the state government’s efforts would need to be scaled up further, particularly in view of the health department’s projections suggesting that the peak of the pandemic was yet to hit Punjab, and it could happen towards the end of August if the doubling period continues to come down as per the current trend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/community-spread-fears-stricter-curbs-imposed-on-weekends-holidays-in-punjab/story-4SGsk0kOA6ycjLz76orHJL.html

Residents, in a letter to the Gurugram deputy commissioner, said that the location of the centre, set up in a guest house, on the main access road is a major cause of concern as the road is frequently used and sees a high footfall. With the rapid increase in the number of Covid-19 cases over the last 10 days, residents said that they want the administration to shift this isolation centre to a location distant from a large population cluster.Sainikhera village, near the Signature tower crossing, has a population of around 3,000 residents, a majority of whom are migrants living on rent. They work in the business establishments of Sector 29, and as helpers and drivers in nearby localities.“We have requested the district administration to look into the matter as this guest house designated as a Covid isolation centre is on the main approach road to the village. Many children, labourers and workers use this road and there is a chance that they could get infected,” said Ishwar Singh, a resident of the village.Residents of South City-1, which is adjacent to the village, said that a number of houses in their colony are also adjacent to this isolation centre, and expressed concern over a possibility of the virus spreading. “The government should establish such facilities in areas, which are less densely populated. It should also use its own guest houses, like the PWD guest house, and other facilities,” said RS Jakhar, a resident of the area.Also, residents of the area called for increased testing, with many expressing scepticism that no one has tested positive for Covid-19 in the area. “We have requested the administration to look into the issue and take action,” said RK Garg, another resident.Amit Khatri, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that he would look into the matter. “Let me check this issue and if there is a genuine problem, we will resolve it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/sainikhera-south-city-1-residents-want-isolation-centre-moved-from-access-road/story-YAFW7bvh1XuH4eQW9EikdL.html

This is the first Covid-19 related death involving police personnel in the district.Inspector Pradeep Dagar, who was working with the summon’s branch at the police commissioner’s office in Civil Lines for the past eight months, had been admitted to the private hospital after he suffered a heart attack, the police said on Thursday. According to the police, Dagar had not been keeping extremely well for the past few years and had also undergone an open-heart surgery last year. “He suffered another heart attack a fortnight ago and was taken to the hospital and underwent two surgeries at the hospital. On June 7, his condition deteriorated and was tested for Covid-19 at a private hospital. His results came back positive on June 8. On Wednesday, he complained of fever and cough,” said, Muhammad Akil, commissioner of police.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, confirmed the death. “The policeman was Covid-19 positive and died due to cardiac arrest.”Dagar, a Sector 15 resident, was working from home since the lockdown was announced, the police said. They added that he was going to retire on July 31 and was allowed to work from home as he was not keeping well. He is survived by his wife and two sons.Akil said all police personnel suffering from terminal illnesses are going to be put in quarantine and have been allowed to remain at home unless they are completely fit to resume duties.At least, 30 Gururgam Police personnel have tested positive for the deadly infection so far.According to police officials, the rising number of cases has triggered anxiety among the families of police personnel.“With the help of the health department, we are maintaining data of positive cases and tracing their close contacts. Those visiting containment areas are directed to wear protected gears and to ensure they maintain social distancing at all times. Our department will take all the necessary steps for the well-being of our personnel and their families.

11-06-2020||Gurugram||After wait of 6 years, Unitech Nirvana Escape in Sector 50 gets occupancy certificate||After waiting for almost six years, the residents of Unitech Nirvana Escape project in Sector 50 finally received the occupancy certificate(OC) on Wednesday, after the developer of the housing complex fulfilled all the necessary licence conditions, met the financial liabilities and settled other dues that had delayed the process. The issuance of OC will now allow the residents of the condominium to finally apply for water, sewage and other civic amenities from government, which were denied to them so far, said the residents’ welfare association (RWA) of the housing complex. The RWA has been pursuing this issue with the developer and the DTCP for the past six years.The Unitech Nirvana Escape project in Sector 50 is spread over 10.09 acres and the licence for the project was issued in 2006. The possession to the house owners was given in 2014. However, since then, the residents have been fighting for the issuance of the occupancy certificate.Santanu Chowdhury, president of the RWA, said that due the delay in getting the OC, the condominium was facing problem in accessing regular water supply, power and sewage connections, which had made life difficult for the 350 families living inside the complex. “Without the OC, the project was not considered a valid legal entity. As such, we faced problems in registration of property deeds, transfer of property, getting bank loans and insurance, etc. Additionally, we faced other infrastructure shortages. We pursued the matter with Unitech and District Town and Country Planning(DTCP) department officials and finally managed to secure it on Wednesday,” he said.Sudhir Jayant, secretary of the RWA, said that all apartment owners were happy at the positive development and hoped that quality of life will further improve after this.DTCP officials said that OC has been granted to seven towers, the EWS block, community building, swimming pool and eight shops after the licence requirements were fulfilled by the developer. “It was after a lot of efforts by the officials, the RWA and director-general of the DTCP that the OC could be granted. There were lot of legal requirements that needed to be completed. The residents will now be able to avail the necessary civic infrastructure from the government,” said RS Bhath, district town planner.Amitabh Das, vice president, business development, Unitech, said that the company obtained clearances from the DTCP, NOCs from other departments, and also cleared financial liabilities of around ₹2.25 crore, after which the OC was issued. “There was a financial crunch but despite that we worked to ensure that the house owners don’t suffer. We are committed to complete our other projects as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/after-wait-of-6-years-unitech-nirvana-escape-in-sector-50-gets-occupancy-certificate/story-4akXbIa7aeRlhaIhtYqY0J.html

The university has sought details about final-year students and the infrastructure and seating capacity for maintaining social distancing. Students in the first and second years will be promoted without an exam and criteria for the same is being decided, said officials.BS Sandhu, controller of examination, MDU, said that final exams for students will take place in the first week of July with physical distancing norms in place. “While the exact dates are yet to be decided, the exams will tentatively take place in the first week of July. We have written to colleges seeking details about the students and the infrastructure capacity which will help us to plan the standard operating procedure for conducting the exams,” said Sandhu.In a directive issued by MDU on Tuesday, colleges have been asked to provide the strength of final-year students in each course, the number of students from foreign countries, and the number of students living in and outside the state. Colleges have also been asked to share if their premises are being used by the government as a quarantine facility or for any other purpose. Further, colleges have been asked to calculate the seating capacity after factoring in physical distancing — one student on one bench, keeping one bench vacant between two students.Pooja Khullar, principal, Dronacharya Government College, said that the college had started compiling internal assessment data for first and second-year students. “While we await more details on the criteria that will be used for promoting first and second-year students, we have started creating a rough database with internal assessment details,” said Khullar.Meanwhile, Gurugram University (GU) administration on Monday said physical examination for final-year postgraduate students will start from mid-July to the first week of August.“We will be holding terminal semester examinations for final year students starting from July 16 with social distancing. We have around 140 students, who will be accommodated in different rooms for the examinations. The plan is to have 10-15 students in each room,” the public relations officer of GU said.The official added the decision to hold the examination might be reconsidered if the Covid situation worsens. “We are also keeping a tab on the coronavirus situation and if things worsen, the examinations may get called off,” said the official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mdu-affiliated-govt-colleges-to-hold-final-semester-exams-in-july/story-C9R8k5Z3pQS9RdAIrS7ALM.html
11-06-2020||Gurugram||Hoteliers request excise dept to replace expired beer with fresh stock||Hotels and restaurants in Gurugram have written to the state excise and taxation department requesting it to either buy-back the beer stock which expired during the nationwide lockdown or replace it with a fresh stock.City hoteliers and restaurant owners said they had procured enough beer stock before thew lockdown was announced, but the stock expired when all hospitality sector establishments shut down on March 25. They said with the stock expiring they have suffered a total loss of nearly ₹1 crore.Bhishan Singh Chauhan, liaison manager, The Leela Hotel, said the more than 2,400 cases of beer with the hotel have expired so far, and another 2,000 cases will expire in July. “We have already suffered a loss of more than ₹9 lakh and if the government does not consider our request we will suffer additional loss of ₹9 lakh,” he said.Sameer Singh, vice president (operations), Lemon Tree Hotels, said the government should either pay hotels for the expired stock or replace the old stock with fresh one to save hotels from suffering more financial losses.Aruna Singh, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (east), said after receiving a letter from hoteliers and restaurateurs, a representation to the senior officials in Panchkula regarding the matter was sent and decision is yet to be taken. “The expired beer will have to be destroyed as it cannot be exchanged, but we are under process of exchanging the stock which will expire in the coming months. The liquor vends can sell liquor, but bars in hotels and restaurants are still closed,” she said.Inderjeet Banga,head of Gurugram chapter of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) said many city restaurants, pubs etc had to destroy beer worth ₹50 lakh during the lockdown. “The expired beer is of no use to either the excise department or to us. Even the department will destroy the beer. Restaurants and hotels in the city have suffered huge losses in light of the lockdown,” said Banga, who owns Pranskster (a restaurant in Sector 29, Gurugram) and the restaurant chain Pirates of the Grill.Restaurant owners said if the excise department exchanges the stock, the saved capital can be used in setting up new arrangements after hospitality service providers receive a green signal from the government to open bars in their establishments.Hotels and restaurants across the country have been incurring losses since the nationwide lockdown came into force on March 25. These establishments had bought stock for routine consumption but have been barred for selling liquor for more than two months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hoteliers-request-excise-dept-to-replace-expired-beer-with-fresh-stock/story-yxDqSZvDf53nGHHac27TgM.html
11-06-2020||Gurugram||Beer dries up in Gurugram, people turn to Delhi for their liquor||Liquor vends across the city have alleged a shortage of stock of beer to serve their customers for more than a month, with some even claiming of having to go to national capital Delhi just to purchase their stock.The wholesale vends said they have not received their supply of beer for the last 40 days at least, despite regular follow-ups with the excise officials in the district and those in Panchkula.Excise officials, however, said that the delay in supply was owing to the Covid cess — between ₹10 and ₹30 on a beer bottle — that had been announced by the state government and which required labels on all bottles to be changed.HC Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west), said that every time there is a change in taxation or policy, the retail price changes as does the label on the product. “Every brand manufacturer has to get approval for these changes from the excise department before releasing their product in the market,” he said.Officials said that the manufacturers, after getting labels approved, supply the beer to the distributors, who then in turn take it to the liquor vends. The beer manufacturing factories are located in Dharuhera, Sonipat , Ambala and Beri near Jhajjar.Dahiya said nearly 9 lakh cases of beer are sold in a month across Haryana, out of which 4 lakh cases are sold in Gurugram alone. Each case of beer consists of 12 beer bottles. Rakesh Kumar, manager at a liquor store on Golf Course Extension Road said they had not received beer stock since the shops reopened on May 6 and have been suffering from loss of both revenue and customers. “We don’t have any stock of beer in our outlet. This has pulled down our sales by almost 50% on a daily basis,” he said.Another employee of a liquor vend in Sector 40 said, “We have absolutely run out of our stock of beer also in the shop and we have no idea when the situation will return to normal. A majority of our customers, during summer, prefer to buy beer. But for the last one month, we have not been able to get any stock of beer and this is causing heavy losses,” said Arun Kumar.The liquor vend owners said due to the shortage, their customers were turning towards Delhi, where beer is cheaper when compared to the city.A case of beer costs ₹3,000 (light) and ₹2,100 (strong) in Gurugram. Delhi, on the other hand, sells the same beer at ₹1,900 (light beer) and ₹2000 (strong beer) for a case. Shashank Kumar, another liquor vend owner, said that only a few brands, which are not so popular among his customers, lay on his shelves. “If the beer shortage issue is not resolved, Delhi will take over and we will suffer losses and the excise department revenues will be hit,” he said.The excise officials said that new beer labels , which have been approved by the excise taxation commissioner, were pending. “There is no deliberate delay from the department’s side and we have already issued all labels. The beer supply will be sorted out within a week and other issues related will be resolved at the earliest,” said Shekhar Vidyarthi, excise and taxation commissioner (ETC), Panchkula.Around 218 liquor shops located in Gururgam opened on May 6, after the state government announced a series of relaxations, following the implementation of Lockdown 3.0 in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/beer-dries-up-in-gurugram-people-turn-to-delhi-for-their-liquor/story-OZG7jSpxcZ0f29onrSVJgJ.html

Similar protests were witnessed outside many city schools last month as well.In the last 20 days, over 15 such protests have been staged by parents.The parents said their economic condition has taken a huge hit amid the lockdown and they can’t afford to pay the fees. They added that schools were charging for facilities like air-conditioners and electricity which are not being used as classes are suspended.Principal of Saint Soldier International School, Vijaya Siddhu said: “We are charging only monthly tuition fees and have reduced the amount according to government instructions. Many parents have appreciated the online classes conducted by the school. Our fee structure is extremely reasonable and most of the parents have paid the monthly fees and do not have any issue about it. However, some parents feel that they should not pay fees because children are not coming to school but we would hope for them to understand that our teachers are making immense efforts to continue the academic process through online teaching, which itself is a huge change for both teachers and students.”A joint complaint was also submitted by parents with 102 signatures to the fee regulatory body of Chandigarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parents-protest-against-chandigarh-school-for-charging-fees-amid-lockdown/story-POK1wvgithEL3JIIiWiybM.html
11-06-2020||Chandigarh||Harbir Anand appointed district education officer of Chandigarh||Harbir Singh replaced Alka Mehta as Chandigarh’s district education officer (DEO) on Thursday while Mehta was promoted to the post of deputy director-3.Besides, 16 principals were also promoted on Thursday.Monica Maini, who was posted as deputy director-3 was given the charge of deputy director-4. Ravinder Kaur will join as deputy DEO-1, whereas Neena Kalia will be deputy DEO-2.Thursday’s developments came in the background of litigation between former DEO Anujit Kaur and Alka Mehta. Anujit Kaur had, in 2019, challenged the appointment of Mehta as DEO in the Chandigarh Administrative Tribunal (CAT) after which Mehta approached the Punjab and Haryana high court which, on January 6, 2020, stayed the order of the CAT. The next hearing of the case is scheduled on August 17. SD Sharma, advocate for Alka Mehta, said the orders amounted to contempt of court.Arun Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, education, UT Chandigarh, said, “The four senior most officers have been posted as deputy directors and the next after them is posted as DEO. The same principle was followed when Alka Mehta was posted as DEO. So, there is no issue in following the same principle of posting Alka Mehta as deputy director when one position of deputy director is vacant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/harbir-anand-appointed-district-education-officer-of-chandigarh/story-ZYFboixNoz1J5Z0eZhey1O.html

Hence, we have decided to turn the almost ready Burns and Plastics unit into a Covid-19 centre. The block already has a built-in ICU and utility pipelines and can be utilised for the treatment of those with Covid-19,” Dr DK Sharma, medical superintendent, AIIMS, said. Currently, the hospital has 725 beds at its cancer centre in Jhajjar and 265 beds at the trauma centre on Ring Road. Of these, 533 beds at the Jhajjar campus and 214 at the trauma centre are already occupied, according to data provided on the ‘Delhi Corona’ app. As for critical care, AIIMS Jhajjar has 39 ICU beds, and the trauma centre 50. The ‘Burns and Plastics’ block will add another 30 beds to the intensive care unit.Doctors, nurses, and technicians from the main hospital will be rejigged to man the new block. Apart from instituting proper protocols for infection control, requirement of manpower for the Jhajjar centre and the burns block was one of the reasons for the hospital not reopening its out-patient clinics.The hospital had shut its OPD services, where over 12,000 patients used to come daily for consultations, at the beginning of the lockdown on March 25.With cases of Covid-19 on the rise, the Delhi government is working towards making 1.5 lakh beds available for those with a severe level of the infection by July-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/aiims-to-turn-its-almost-ready-burns-unit-with-100-beds-into-covid-facility/story-88SwSdqZQmrf5QHyXYvmdO.html

We are carrying out a door-to-door inspection of each beneficiary. I have ordered an audit of all anganwadi centres and payments to the agencies concerned will be stopped until the report comes. Strictest possible action will be taken against those found guilty,” Gautum said.

The matter is likely to be heard on Friday.The public interest litigation (PIL), filed by advocate Anirban Mondal and his employee Pawan Kumar, said the Delhi government itself has admitted that there would be around one lakh Covid-19 cases in the city by June-end and the number would rise to around 2.25 lakh by mid-July and over 5.5 lakh by July-end.Mondal’s plea also contended that given the situation, the government should consider imposing a strict lockdown in the city. The petition, filed through advocate Mridul Chakravarty, has also sought a direction to the Delhi government to consider constituting an expert committee of doctors, medical specialists and virologists to prepare a “detailed blueprint” for controlling or containing the spread of the virus.The petition sought imposition of a lockdown on the grounds that during the earlier lockdown period, the doubling rate of Covid-19 cases was low. It said by allowing the movement of people and economic activities in the national capital, “the spread of the virus has severely spiked, resulting in a sharp rise in numbers of daily cases”.“That, primary focus/efforts/ resources of the state, as of now should not be on the monetary/ economic aspects, but on health and safety of its people,” the petition read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/plea-in-high-court-seeks-reimposition-of-lockdown-in-delhi/story-qlpTuSZCwuWUv8oFtmcIhM.html

I have taken up the matter with commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal and both the departments would commence drives from June 25. Strict action would be taken against the violators and FIRs would also be lodged.”Patron of the Akalgarh Market Association Maninderpal Singh (Prince) Middha said, “The market shopkeepers are also facing problems due to encroachments by a few of the shopkeepers outside their shops. The encroachers cover most part of the road resulting in traffic bottlenecks.”The police department has also shared the information through its Facebook page urging shopkeepers and street vendors to remove encroachments from city roads.Agrawal said, “It has come to light that many shopkeepers and street vendors have again encroached upon the city roads in different areas of the city. FIRs would be lodged against the violators, if they fail to remove encroachments by June 25.”Earlier, in the last week of February, the police had announced the third phase of the anti-encroachment drive and 60 roads of the city had to be covered. The authorities had covered 40 roads in the initial two phases and lodged FIRs against around 100 shopkeepers and vendors.The drives were opposed by different vendor associations stating that the MC had failed to establish vending zones in the city and before removing the vendors from roads, the MC should set up a zone for vendors, where they could earn their livelihood.Sandhu said the MC was working on establishing permanent vending zones in the city. However, 100 proposed vending zones have been identified by the MC and the lists have also been provided to the vendors. The vendors could install their vends at these sites, he added||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/police-mc-to-restart-anti-encroachment-drives-in-ludhiana-from-june-25/story-541rItIUf0VSZ1ukYzffcJ.html

As religious places along with several other establishments, like shopping malls and offices, opened across the country on June 8, Bukhari asked governments to reconsider their decision in view of the rapid spread of the coronavirus. According to latest official figures, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi is over 32,000 including 984 deaths. The number of active coronavirus patients in the city is over 19,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jama-masjid-closed-till-june-30-due-to-critical-covid-19-situation-in-delhi-shahi-imam/story-mtWD4emXhD9qtdtSR4sAAN.html
11-06-2020||City||Srinagar MC mayor to face no confidence motion again||Srinagar mayor Junaid Azim Mattu on Thursday said a no-confidence motion has been moved against him at the behest of the Bharatiya Janata Party, and asserted that he enjoyed majority in the municipal corporation and would take on the challenge democratically and legally.“Been informed that BJP has sought a ‘Vote of No Confidence’ in the SMC against me. Those who have submitted the motion are either elected members/office bearers of BJP or unambiguously associated with BJP. This is the second such motion by BJP against me within six months,” Mattu said.In December last year, he had defeated a similar attempt by a group of corporators to vote him out of position. BJP’s media in-charge for Kashmir, Manzoor Bhat, said 27 corporators affiliated with the party have moved the motion and that around 15 more members have extended support to it. The SMC has 74 wards.Srinagar MC secretary also confirmed that a no confidence motion has been moved against the mayor by some corporators.In a series of tweets, he blamed the National Conference, Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) for joining hands to move a no-confidence motion against him. While hinting that the corporators of the three parties are coming together to topple him as the city mayor, Mattu tweeted:” If @BJP4India @INCIndia and @JKNC_ are actually coming together to vote me out — I wear it as a badge of honour! BJP and Congress have never allied in the country’s history and if they want to ally now against us, I couldn’t ask for a greater validation of my dignity.” Shortly after the SMC mayor’s tweet, the National Conference spokesperson had denied it. “The party has no understanding or inclination to have an understanding with the BJP. Neither in the SMC nor elsewhere,” the spokesperson said.BJP state spokesperson, Altaf Thakur said majority of corporators are not happy with Mattu and they want former deputy mayor Sheikh Imran as the SMC mayor. “We have nine members and they will support Sheikh Imran. This time, the no confidence motion will be successful as corporators of all parties are not happy with Mattu and feel he is neglecting their wards,” he said. Jammu and Kashmir Congress Committee president Ghulam Ahmad Mir said Mattu became the mayor with help of former governor Satya Pal Malik. “We have nothing to do with his position as a mayor. Some people having roots in Delhi are trying to dislodge him. A few months ago, he had managed to defeat the no confidence motion with the help of these corporators who are now trying to defeat him.”Mir said the Congress has 17 corporators in the SMC and they have nothing to do with the BJP. “The BJP has only three members. How can they bring him down. However, there are many disgruntled corporators in the SMC who want Mattu out because according to them he is not an able leader.”Mattu, 35, had resigned from the National Conference only to participate in the polls in 2018. A former financial analyst who returned from the US barely a decade ago to join politics, he is also one of the senior leaders of the People’s Conference led by Sajjad Lone.The term of the mayor and the deputy mayor is 30 months and both office bearers have to seek a fresh mandate from the corporators. They have more than 18 months to seek a fresh mandate within the corporation. Interestingly, Mattu had secured 40 votes to win the election in 2018 and the BJP corporators had supported him. He bagged more than 45 votes last year to defeat the no confidence motion and then deputy mayor Sheikh Imran who was in jail was also removed. However, Imran has been released and he is now trying to topple Mattu.With agency inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/srinagar-mc-mayor-to-face-no-confidence-motion-again/story-VgS1vGMz8Cb3ptJsgwOqoO.html

Two of them have promised me that they will organise Durga Puja next year and buy idols from my studio,” Prodyut Pal said.Kanchi Paul, one of the few female artisans in the potters’ hub, said, “The jinx has been broken. I have got confirmation from five Durga Puja committees in Kolkata. We will start work in full swing once the artisans return to Kumartuli from their villages.” “Other artisans are also getting orders for idols, albeit smaller in size, from local puja committees but the numbers so far are lesser than last year’s. We badly want things to look up,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/it-s-viral/kumartuli-artist-sends-durga-idol-made-of-fibreglass-all-the-way-to-australia/story-ceRryzKPpUcLSCBEEd8A4K.html

11-06-2020||City||Health scam, slow pace of development amid corona crisis dominate Himachal BJP meeting||Corruption in the health department and the slow pace of development amid the Covid-19 pandemic dominated the discussion at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) legislature meet in Shimla, which was convened to draw up a strategy to counter the opposition Congress after it escalated its attack on chief minister Jai Ram Thakur.The meeting held at the government-run Hotel Peterhoff on Wednesday evening lasted four hours. Thakur faced a volley of questions from BJP legislators over issues, including the bribe for health equipment scam that triggered the exit of Rajeev Bindal as state BJP chief after his name was dragged into the controversy.Thakur reiterated that the party is clean and said that his government has zero tolerance for corruption as legislators repeatedly sought clarification from him on Bindal’s resignation.“If the party has nothing to do with the graft case being investigated then why did the state president resign? The resignation has sent out a wrong signal,” a BJP legislator at the meeting said. Some even favoured Bindal’s reinstatement.Most legislators were keen that the party appoint the new party chief at the earliest. The names of former Naina Devi legislator and acting president Randhir Sharma, the chief minister’s political secretary, Trilok Jamwal, and Kangra Cooperative Bank chairman Rajeev Bhardwaj were discussed.RESUME DEVELOPMENT GRANT: MLASLegislators expressed concern about developmental works coming to a standstill due to the coronavirus crisis. They called for resuming the development grant that has been stopped since the pandemic broke out.A few legislators referred to the chief minister’s helpline, saying “it’s rather proving to be a boon for Congress workers who call up to complain about the works initiated in constituencies. Consequently, the officers take cognizance and works are stopped during these corona times,” said another legislator.ACTIVE CASE FINDING HELPEDThakur focused his address on the steps taken by his government to combat Covid-19. He highlighted the efforts to bring back more than 1.8 lakh stranded people of the state in other parts of the country. This did lead to a spike in Covid-19 cases, he said, adding that still the situation is under control as the state government has made arrangements to ensure people arriving from other states are examined and kept in institutional or home quarantine according to their travel history and medical status.He said that even Prime Minister Narendra Modi had appreciated the state’s active case finding campaign and asked other states to emulate the example. The chief minister also asked the legislators to counter the Congress campaign against the BJP after the pandemic gets over. It was decided that the legislators will hold press conferences in their constituencies for this purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/health-scam-slow-pace-of-development-amid-corona-crisis-dominate-himachal-bjp-meeting/story-DHiBxPHK0rySs4mIaxyXgJ.html

11-06-2020||Mumbai||Bars, restaurants allowed to do home delivery of foreign liquor in Mumbai||Mumbaikars have been allowed to order liquor from their nearest bars and restaurants via home delivery amid the easing of lockdown restrictions, which were imposed since mid-March to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, and the Maharashtra government’s Mission Begin Again campaign to restore a semblance of normalcy in the city, despite the pandemic.On Tuesday, the Bombay high court (HC) was informed by the state government that the collectors of Mumbai city and Mumbai suburban districts have issued orders, allowing FL-III licence holder bars and restaurants to sale liquor by home delivery in sealed bottles.Additional government pleader Abhay Patki, however, clarified that the permission has been given to clear the existing liquor stock of licenced bars and restaurants.Patki’s submission to the court was in response to a petition filed by the Indian Hotel and Restaurant Association, which had complained that home delivery of liquor by restaurants holding FL-III licences in a bid to clear their existing stock was prevented by the authorities, despite the state excise department’s order to that effect issued on May 19.The plea also pointed out that the collectors of Mumbai city and Mumbai suburban districts, however, issued an order on May 22, allowing liquor shops to do home delivery of foreign liquor to their customers.The plea, filed through advocate Veena Thadani, stated that though bar and restaurant owners across Mumbai have paid hefty licence fees, their businesses have suffered massive losses because of the prolonged lockdown restrictions due to the viral outbreak.The liquor items, which have sell-by dates, will become unfit for human consumption soon, the plea added.Later, advocate Thadani withdrew the petition after Patki informed the court that Mumbaikars have been allowed to order liquor from their nearest bars and restaurants via home delivery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bars-restaurants-allowed-to-do-home-delivery-of-foreign-liquor-in-mumbai/story-cilsQgQnzYhb5aMZZujRyK.html

With 16 century stands between them, the Indian duo are joint second with Adam Gilchrist and Matthew Hayden in the most hundred-run partnerships in the list led by compatriots Sachin Tendulkar and Sourav Ganguly (21).“I know him (Rohit) from U-19 days. He was a junior by one-two years and we have camped together. We trust each other and have a great friendship, it works for us,” Dhawan said in an Instagram chat hosted by his IPL franchise Delhi Capitals. “We both know each other’s nature and characters. I know how he is exactly. It’s a proud feeling that we have done so well for India.” The 34-year-old said their off-the-field chemistry has worked well for them.Also read: Windies cherishing test return after coronavirus hiatus says Jason Holder“It brings you positive energy and vibes when everything is in sync.

Both of are great legends, great captains. I learnt a lot about leadership quality from them, how they back their players and build the team,” said Dhawan. “They always gave the same attention to everyone, be it seniors and juniors, there was equal treatment to all.

11-06-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: Farewell, lockdown silence||It was never so quiet. So quiet that one could clearly hear the chirping of birds at noon time, as if this were a bird-filled orchard.For more than two months, the extraordinarily noisy Old Delhi went soundless. The coronavirus triggered lockdown sapped out all its voices. The Walled City lanes that never slept went into a long slumber. Residents would use the haunting word ‘sannata’ to describe the deathly stillness that would pervade the narrow alleyways from morning to night, and night to morning.But now the lockdown is officially over in the Capital and on Monday, for the first time in the area around Jama Masjid, non-essential shops opened—the cloth traders sat in their cramped stores with topi on their head and mask on their face.The lanes again stirred with the cries of itinerant hawkers, including of those men selling cheap masks from door to door.As the old life wafted back, there was also the sense of a renewed loss—felt at least by one Walled City dweller. Shaheena, who describes herself as a woman first and then as “a wife, mother and grandmother.”In her 50s, she lives near Matia Mahal bazar and admits she is relieved that things appear to be getting back to normal “but I had started liking the khamoshi (silence).”Talking on WhatsApp video, she recalls the recent afternoons of the lockdown days when “I would hear nothing, everything seemed peaceful.... just the opening of fridge by someone in the house would feel a sound too loud for the ears.”Shaheena spends most of her waking hours either in praying and reading newspapers or in cooking food for the family. “I feel sukoon (calm) these days”—she is of course worried about the pandemic but at least, for now, all her relatives and friends are reported to be well. In the pre-corona days, the bedroom window in her second-floor home would be shut “due to the noise coming from the street below... the cries of the machhli walla, kebab walla, biryani walla, kharbooj walla....”But these days she tended to leave the window open.“Late in the afternoon, just before the evening,” says Shaheena, “I would, without fail, start to hear the ho-ho sounds of people on rooftops flying their kabutars.” Pigeon-flying would take place in the pre-corona era too “but amid all the din during the old days, I would never hear that sound.”During the lockdown, the ho-ho would be as clear to her as if it were emanating from within her own home. Which can’t be ruled out because Shaheena’s husband, Guddu bhai, is a pigeon lover and is himself a proud owner of a vast collection of birds, that he lovingly maintains on the roof of their house.The only disconcerting bit of the lockdown silence, apart from the dreadful awareness of the virus that caused it, was the occasional “sobbing” of dogs in the area that would fill Shaheena’s heart with forebodings of fear. “We often used to hear their barking but never their crying.”Regardless, the old sounds of the BC (Before Corona) era are coming back, Shaheena says. “I will miss the silence.”But the next moment she partially contradicts herself, insisting that “silence is fine but I’m glad that the poor shopkeepers are finally able to open their businesses even if their shops are still empty of shoppers.... I’m truly happy for all the people who were fearing for their rozgaar (employment).”Now she stands by her window for a photo shoot, as her son holds the phone steady.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-farewell-lockdown-silence/story-ny0uria1KEpFeIxTu9yEYM.html

11-06-2020||Delhi||‘Save gyms’: Owners in Delhi say for 70% of them it’s now or never||Seventy per cent of Delhi’s gyms may shut down for good if they don’t resume business next month, a survey conducted by the Delhi Gym Association revealed.The survey, which was conducted over five days with the sample size of over 1,000 gyms, further stated that if gyms are not opened in August as well, as many as 87% gym owners will have to wrap up their businesses because of huge losses they incurred during the lockdown.Gyms and wellness centres in the city have been closed for over 80 days due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The gym association has appealed to the central and the state governments to allow these facilities to restart operations so the industry can survive. There are around 5,500 registered gyms across the city, including small, medium and branded ones.Gym owners have also demanded financial assistance from the government to tide over the crisis. Nearly 50 gym owners and trainers staged a protest at the Delhi Secretariat on Wednesday demanding that fitness centres be reopened and the industry receive a special relief package. “Gyms should be allowed to operate. It’s a matter of our survival,” Parvinder Singh, a member of Indian Gym Welfare Federation, the body which held the protest, said.The Delhi government is yet to decide on the reopening of gyms and fitness centres across the city. The central government, in an order on May 30, had said that they would take a decision on the reopening of gymnasiums and swimming pools during the “third phase” of the unlocking plan. Though there is no exact time specified for the third phase, it cannot take place before July because the state governments are yet to decide details of the second phase, which will deal with the reopening of schools and colleges, that month.Chirag Sethi, vice-president of the Delhi Gym Association, said that gyms were shut even before the lockdown was announced on March 25 and they have had no business for last 84 days. “Despite there being no business, owners have had to pay a hefty amount in rent, water and electricity bills, and maintenance charges,” Sethi said.“It will result in large-scale unemployment in fitness centres and gyms as owners will not be able to recover the financial losses,” the survey report stated.Nikhil Kakkar, CEO, Gold Gyms India, said that the Covid-19 crisis has impacted the fitness industry adversely across India, irrespective of the class and brand of gyms, and the road ahead is tough even for big fitness chains. “With steep rentals and payrolls, survival is tough in this crisis. Nearly 70% to 75% gyms will bear the brunt of Covid-19 if they are not opened soon,” Kakkar said.Smaller gyms are likely to be hit the worst due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Prateek Chaudhary, the owner of several small-scale gyms in Shahdara and Dilshad Garden, said that local gyms are more vulnerable as they have no financial backing. “At gyms, people build their immunity and strength, hence they should be considered as important as salons and restaurants. We are ready to follow all social distancing and safety measures along with proper sanitisation of our centres,” Chaudhary said.Jugal Kishor, head, community medicine, at Safdarjung Hospital, said, “Gyms can be made safer when social distancing norms are followed strictly.

He had a heart condition, diabetes, and also liver ailment. He was at home for the past three-four months, as he wasn’t keeping well,” Bukhari said.An official from the Shahi Imam’s office said on Tuesday night Bukhari had sought the opinion of the people on temporarily shutting down the Jama Masjid until the viral outbreak is reined in. “A message was circulated on Tuesday night seeking people’s opinion on the matter. Most people have been in favour of shutting down the mosque until the Covid-19 crisis blows over,” the official said.On Monday, around 200 people offered namaz at the Jama Masjid after it reopened following the easing of lockdown restrictions.“I’ve also urged other mosques to appeal to people to offer namaz at home. All social gatherings should be strictly avoided,” said Bukhari.Delhi reported 1,336 new Covid-19 positive cases till Tuesday night, as the overall tally rose to 31,309, including 905 deaths, the health authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bukhari-seeks-opinion-on-shutting-jama-masjid/story-LefNna2ckA22FtIgd7TlnJ.html
11-06-2020||Delhi||In rush to save lives, firefighters are exposed to Covid; 7 positive so far||On June 3, a 32-year-old personnel of the Delhi Fire Services (DFS), stationed at the Shankar Road fire station, tested positive for the infectious coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Over the next 48 hours, the fire station, located amid popular and busy markets, offices and residential areas, was cordoned off. But despite the risk, all personnel were asked to continue their duties.Till Monday, at least seven from the DFS had tested positive for the virus infection. Cases were reported from stations on Shankar Road, in Naraina, Paschim Vihar, the Fire Safety Management Academy in Rohini, and from the control room in Connaught Place.But unlike other government departments and emergency services, where if an employee is tested positive, large-scale contact tracing is carried out to isolate those at risk of infection before the building itself is shut, the fire department is only able to do the bare minimum to prevent the spread of the virus within its teams.The already short-staffed DFS is now facing the daunting task of managing an increased number of fire-related calls with several of its personnel benched.Officials said that along with the necessity of having to maintain close proximity with victims during rescue operations and the inability to wear personal protective equipment (PPE), they are attending to calls blindly with no information as to how many Covid-19 cases were reported from the fire spots. This, officials said, was putting them in danger of contracting the infection.Fire chief Atul Garg said even though it was inevitable that the infection would hit the fire department, unlike the Delhi Police or any other government agency, the fire services cannot afford to take any more personnel off active duty. The 2,700-strong department attends to nearly 40,000 to 50,000 calls a year, translating to nearly 120 calls daily. This number, however, increases to 200-250 a day during summer.“The number of Covid-19 infections has surged so much that we treat every call with caution. We are majorly short-staffed but we cannot ignore calls from containment zones. But we are facing a huge risk,” Garg said.Sukhi Ram, a fireman at the Narela fire station, said even though personnel are equipped with their uniform of overalls, gumboots and breathing apparatus while dousing a blaze, they are forced to touch unknown objects with their hands during cooling operations.“It is difficult to know who is infected because many could be asymptomatic. We go in blind with no information on whether the occupants of a burning structure are patients or carriers. Who will ensure our safety?” he said.On May 23, a fire at a Covid-19 hospital in South Delhi was attended by the DFS and it wasn’t until they reached the hospital that they were told that there were at least five Covid-19 patients in the building, who had to be evacuated. Of those in the building, three were critical and on oxygen support and had to be carried out by the rescuers.Senior fire officials said the chances of a fire personnel catching the disease are high not only because of the nature of their job and the number of calls they attend, but also because of the close proximity in which they have to operate with their team mates.Of all cases that have been detected within the department till now, the source of the infection is unclear and that worries them. “We have to work for 24 hours and then we are off duty for the next 24 hours. During our duty, we stay with our team members in a hostel-like set-up where beds are closely lined together and there is barely any scope for social distancing,” an official said, on condition of anonymity.The official said many DFS officials travel to and from neighbouring states, covering long distances. Exposure during travel has also become a concern.Citing the example of Mumbai, where at least 60 firefighters have already been infected, former Delhi fire chief SK Dheri said the period of duty can be increased for fire officials so that any symptoms that appear can be tracked.“At present, the duty schedule is 24 hours of duty and 24 hours off, but if we allow four or five days of duty and the next four or five days off, then they can assess the symptoms and use the leave period to quarantine themselves. While staying at the station, officials will also have to ensure ample distance among themselves. Meanwhile, since this infection does not look like it is going anywhere at least for some time, the administration can expedite the recruitment process of the DFS, which is so short of hands that it cannot afford to lose people,” Dheri said.The officials said with more and more pockets of the city being marked as containment zones, they are treating each call with extreme care. They are also sanitising their buildings and equipment themselves.Accepting the increased risk faced by emergency teams, a senior government official said the city is struggling with poor data management of the daily tally of Covid19 cases and the death toll from each area. This means that any information passed on to the DFS would be useless by the time it reached them. “We get data from hospitals and labs after a delay of one or two days. At least we manage to release the daily bulletin with updated figures,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-rush-to-save-lives-firefighters-are-exposed-to-covid-7-positive-so-far/story-9Za0I2HDZ0m1lo2xcq0o3H.html

11-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Missing’ woman found dead in hospital toilet||An 82-year-old woman from Bhusaval, who went missing from Jalgaon Civil Hospital on June 2, was found dead inside the toilet of the hospital on Wednesday morning.The woman, who stayed with her daughter-in-law in Bhusaval, had tested positive for Covid-19 on May 27 and was first admitted to a railway hospital at Bhusaval by her nephew and relative. “Her daughter-in-law died two weeks ago due to the virus, while her son is still in quarantine at Nashik. After her condition deteriorated, she was shifted to Jalgaon Civil Hospital on June 1,” said Akbar Patel, inspector at Zillapeth police station. “On June 2, she left her bed without informing the nurse or hospital staff. The family told us she was missing, after which we registered a missing person’s complaint on June 6. On Wednesday morning, a ward boy of JCH found her partially decomposed body inside the toilet. The family was informed and they identified her.”The body was handed over to the local authority and the last rites were conducted in the presence of her grandson. In a video message, her distraught grandson has appealed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to order a probe into the incident, reported IANS. Kishor Pawar, assistant police inspector at Zillapeth police, said: “We have filed an accidental death report and are questioning the hospital staff.

11-06-2020||Chandigarh||No touching, please: Decades-old Sukhna Lake akhada being tilled back to life in Chandigarh||After a gap of almost two-and-a-half months, the age-old ritual of tilling the soil, preparing it for wrestling and praying to the idol of Hanuman has returned to the Sukhna lake akhada—the only traditional wrestling centre in Chandigarh.Almost five decades old, the akhada lies on a roadside between the lake and the golf course and is the oldest active akhada keeping the tradition of mud wrestling alive in the tricity.Though wrestling is a physical contact sport, and has not been allowed after sports activities resumed in a post-lockdown Chandigarh, life is returning back to normal at the akhada. Except for slugging or doing group exercises in the mud pit, the wrestlers dressed in the traditional loincloth have started doing regular workouts outside the pit.“For a wrestler, akhada is a sacred place. So I am really happy to be back here after a gap of two months. Because of social distancing we can’t wrestle, but we are able to workout. Nothing can match the atmosphere of training at the lake akhada,” says 15-year-old Sahil, who competed in the 55kg freestyle event at the under-15 national championship held last year at Kota, Rajasthan.ONLY SENIOR WRESTLERS ALLOWEDBefore the lockdown on any given day there used to be an attendance of over 50 wrestlers, but now only 15-20 wrestlers are allowed in the morning and evening sessions.“We are only allowing senior wrestlers or the ones who have played at the national-level to come for training at the akhada. After the daily rituals, the wrestlers do their workouts outside the pit. Even during individual workouts we are taking care that proper distancing is maintained and there isn’t any sharing of equipment like weights, dumbbells, without sanitizing,” said Raja Phelwan, who works with Chandigarh Police and maintains the akhada.In the 60s, there used to be a police post adjoining the akhada and the personnel who were posted there started training here. Since then the akhada has been maintained by the Chandigarh Police. The country’s top wrestlers including Olympic medallists Sushil Kumar and Yogeshwar Dutt have trained here.“The akhada is almost fifty years old. Even the legendary wrestler, Mehar Din, used to train here. Even during the time of terrorism, our seniors used to prepare the akhada (by tilling the mud) on a daily basis. For the first time during the lockdown, the tradition was put on a hold. Time we even missed the Hanuman Jayanti on April 27, which otherwise is a time for celebration here,” added Raja Phelwan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/no-touching-please-decades-old-sukhna-lake-akhada-being-tilled-back-to-life-in-chandigarh/story-aKiuzxIhNNnfuZjoXuOqFK.html

11-06-2020||Mumbai||113-hectare Lonar Lake in Buldhana turns pink||The water at the 113-hectare Lonar Crater Lake in Buldhana district turned reddish-pink over the past week. A similar phenomenon was reported from the Talawe wetlands in Navi Mumbai on May 16 as one section of the wetland patch had turned pink. In the Lonar case, after local residents shared photographs with the Maharashtra forest department, the latter on Wednesday asked the National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI), Nagpur to assess why there has been a change in colour.“We will be collecting water samples and sending it to NEERI soon. We will know the exact reason within two weeks,” said MS Reddy, additional principal chief conservator of forests (wildlife) and field director, Melghat Tiger Reserve.Other officials said some local residents had informed the department about a similar change in water colour last year during this period as well. “The colour, however, was not this dense. Although this needs to be verified by scientists, but this is most likely due to algal growth. During late summer season when water levels reduce and there is high salinity, an algal bloom results in such changes in colour,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra.There are several examples of such a phenomenon across the globe due to high salinity and action by algae, but it needs to be confirmed based on scientific studies, said Reddy.In Talawe’s case, researchers and microbiologists had attributed the change in colour to vigorous growth of algae or bacteria (halobacteria) growing in an extremely high saline environment having beta-Carotene, which gives this type of characteristic colouration to the water.“The uniqueness of this lake is that it is alkaline as well as saline at the same time, and the water level parameters change as we move from one end to the other making it a complex ecosystem home to large biodiversity,” said Kakodkar.Located 500km from Mumbai and over 90km from Buldhana city, the oval-shaped Lonar Lake is a part of the 383-hectare Lonar Wildlife Sanctuary declared on June 8, 2000 as part of the Deccan plateau. The lake has an average diametre of over 6,000 feet, while it is 449 feet deep. According to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, it was said to have formed as a result of a meteorite impact that occurred between 35,000 and 50,000 years ago. It was identified as a unique geographical site by a British officer C J E Alexander in 1823, and also declared a notified National Geo-heritage Monument in 1979. A combined area of 366-hectare of Lonar Lake and surrounding regions was first proposed to be declared as a Ramsar site, a wetland of ecological importance, in 2017 by the state forest department. “The area is expected to soon be declared as a Ramsar site as the final documentation process is underway,” said a joint secretary from the Union environment ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/113-hectare-lonar-lake-in-buldhana-turns-pink/story-E87FKz9i4xRFaWDSR8bLEO.html
11-06-2020||Mumbai||Monsoon session of state pushed to August 3; plan to hold it online||The state government has decided to postpone the monsoon session of the legislature, scheduled for June 22 in Mumbai, to August 3, against the backdrop of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to contain its spread. The legislature is also preparing for an online mechanism to enable members to participate from their constituencies in the remotest areas of the state.A business advisory committee (BAC) which comprises chairman of the legislative Council Ramraje Naik Nimbalkar, speaker of the Assembly Nana Patole, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and leaders of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, decided to postpone the session by six weeks in its meeting held on Wednesday. The session is likely to be held for two weeks. Before that, the government may also call for a special session of a day to get supplementary demands passed, enabling expenditure on health care infrastructure amid the Covid-19 pandemic. The government expenditure needs approval of the legislature. The government has, however, not yet decided if the monsoon session will be held online or will it be a hybrid seating arrangement. The state legislature has, however, started preparations to hold the session online with a capacity of allowing 1,000 people to participate at a time. The legislature administration held presentations of at least five software companies over the past few days. “We have taken presentations from leading players providing videoconference platforms. Cisco, Google, Microsoft, Blue Jeans, Alcatel have shown interest in providing high-end platforms for such an online session. The platform will have facility of even voting on any motion if need be. The legislators will be able to participate from the remotest areas of the state or even by using video-conference facilities at district headquarters. Our system will be user-friendly, enabling legislators to participate using their smartphones,” said an official from the state legislature.The officer said that they expect the platform to incur much less expenditure than spent when the sessions are typically held with the physical presence of all members. He said that the total expenditure would not be more than ₹4 lakh, including the additional workforce needed to be engaged for it. The decision about the form in which the session needs to be conducted is expected to be taken next month. “It all depends on the pandemic situation by the end of July. If it is well in control, we may allow the members to participate physically, or otherwise only ministers and officials with mandatory physical presence will only be allowed to attend it personally. Others will be asked to participate online. Next meeting is expected to be held in the last week of July to take a decision over it,” an official from CMO said.Leader of Opposition in legislative Assembly and former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis suggested to hold a day-long session to get supplementary demands passed in the wake of the rising expenditure on the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/monsoon-session-of-state-pushed-to-august-3-plan-to-hold-it-online/story-KXvLXBEjzf4iZ56SnehIZM.html
11-06-2020||Mumbai||Plasma therapy trials soon for state’s serious Covid patients||In a significant development, the Maharashtra government received permission to conduct multi-centric trials of convalescent plasma therapy on Covid-19 patients. For the first time in the country, trials will be conducted by a state on serious Covid-19 patients. The trials will be conducted at 21 medical colleges across Maharashtra, which is the most affected state in the country, with 94,041 Covid-19 cases. Currently, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is conducting trials of convalescent plasma therapy on mild and moderate patients. In Maharashtra, they are being held at five government colleges and six private medical colleges.“There is no ongoing trial for serious patients. The state medical education department has decided to sponsor multi-centric trials for serious patients. Around 21 medical colleges have been shortlisted,” said Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary, medical education department. “The Drug Controller General of India has approved it. This would be the largest trial in the world for the use of convalescent plasma as therapy for severe patients. If it is successful, plasma therapy will become standard practice in treatment of severe patients.”In Mumbai, the trials will be conducted at Grant Medical College, Topiwala National Medical College at BYL Nair Hospital, KEM Medical College, Lokmanya Tilak Municipal Medical College at Sion, and Cooper Hospital Medical College.While Mukherjee will act as the sponsor, Government Medical College in Nagpur will be the lead institution and Dr Shushant Meshram will be the principal investigator.In convalescent plasma therapy, antibodies from the blood of a recovered Covid-19 patient are used to treat an infected patient. The process involves transfusion of plasma, a blood component, from a recovered patient to an infected patient. The therapy can also be used to provide immunity to those at high risk of contracting the novel coronavirus.“We will be building a facility to conduct the trials at the colleges. It means infrastructure will also be created there, which will come as another advantage for the state,” said Mukherjee. “We are all excited as it is happening in the country for the first time.”Officials said the trials will start immediately after approval from the ethics committee of the medical colleges. However, it will take 15-20 days to procure machines and equipment for places where it is not available. “Trials can be conducted on around 2,000 patients at a time in the beginning at all 21 medical colleges,” said a senior official, on condition of anonymity. “The process of making a list of donors, too, has already started.”Who can donate plasma?There are three criteria to make a person eligible to become a donor. The person has to have been infected with Covid-19 and completely recovered. He/she has completed 28 days from the time of testing negative for the virus and has haemoglobin level of 12.5 grams per decilitre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/plasma-therapy-trials-soon-for-state-s-serious-covid-patients/story-6bDqvXPNaF2cvK8uQsw5KI.html
11-06-2020||Mumbai||Maha sees sharpest one-day spike in cases and deaths||As Maharashtra recorded its highest single-day jump in Covid-19 cases yet with 3,254 fresh Covid-19 infections, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday reiterated his demand to resume local train services for those working in essential and emergency services. Thackeray also warned that relaxations would be withdrawn if norms to reduce crowding are not followed, adding that the threat of Covid-19 still persists.With the fresh cases, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra stands at 94,041. Maharashtra also recorded is 149 new fatalities, of which 66 occurred in the past two days, while the remaining 83 were recorded between April 18 and June 6.Mumbai recorded 1,567 new Covid-10 cases and 97 deaths, its highest for a day. Besides Mumbai, 15 deaths were recorded in Thane, 10 in Pune, seven in Aurangabad, five each in Navi Mumbai and Jalgaon, three in Ulhasnagar, two each in Vasai-Virar and Akola, one each in Beed, Amravati, and Gadchiroli. The state also saw 1,879 patients discharged on Wednesday, taking the total number of people recovered and discharged to 44,517. The active cases in the state stand at 46,074.Thackeray, while speaking to the media at Vidhan Bhavan, said the state government was insisting on the resumption of suburban services in Mumbai. “We have been demanding from the Centre the resumption of rail services. The hospital staff and other workforce engaged in essential and emergency services are finding it difficult to commute from far-off areas to Mumbai. Some of them are not even able to report for duty. The resumption of locals is very important for the facility of this workforce,” he said.However, senior railway officials in Mumbai have stated there have been no directions from the railway ministry on the starting operation of local trains. “There has been no discussion regarding local trains during any of the video conferences. The outstation train services that have been started are only after discussions and approval from the ministry of home affairs. A decision regarding local train operations will also be taken post discussion with the ministry of home affairs,” said a senior railway official who did want to be named.Thackeray had demanded the resumption of suburban railway services for Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), during his video conference with prime minister Narendra Modi a month ago.The chief minister said that the government is moving “cautiously” on unlocking the curbs it had put in March to contain the spread of coronavirus in the state. The current phase of the lockdown with restrictions will remain till June 30, he said. However, he warned that the government would be compelled to withdraw relaxations if crowding does not reduce and if norms are flouted.The statement comes after there was crowding seen in Mumbai and parts of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) after restrictions were lifted from Monday. Crowding was seen at bus stops, at promenades during morning and evening walks, etc.Mumbai, and MMR, which includes Thane, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Mira-Bhayander, Palghar, Panvel, Raigad, Kalyan-Dombivli, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi, was the latest to see relaxationS in curbs. Mumbai and MMR, which crossed the 70,000-mark, have been Covid-19 hotspots since the outbreak.“The threat of Covid-19 has not passed, it still persists. As we continue to battle corona[virus], we cannot put the brakes on wheels of the economy. We were shocked looking at the crowd on the first day. Outdoor physical activities are permitted for your good health and not to spoil it. People will have to keep physical distance [while stepping out]. Public transport, including buses and suburban trains, have not been started. The government is evaluating it. If we feel that the lifting of lockdown is life-threatening, then we will be forced to impose the lockdown again,” Thackeray said, adding that he is confident that the people of Maharashtra will continue to listen to the government’s rules and guidelines.Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital, said that the unlocking of activities would definitely give rise to the number of cases in the state. He added that the people should still continue to only venture if it is essential. “I think there would definitely be a rise in cases. The graph [of cases] is still upward. The unlocking should also be accompanied by adequate educating of people. Unlocking is an economic decision and not because we are confident that all is well. Unfortunately, people do not understand this; they assume that because restrictions are lifted they can go all out. The wise thing is to still step out only if one is doing essential work even though if it is not mandated by law. People are seen walking on promenades; this is luxury,” Pinto said.(with inputs from Aroosa Ahmed)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-sharpest-one-day-spike-in-cases-and-deaths/story-KNqN4PHOTRCRvE83WeioZL.html

11-06-2020||Mumbai||Families of Covid-19 patients stock up on oxygen cylinders||Amid the shortage of beds with oxygen facilities, families of Covid-19 patients are providing oxygen therapy at home, even as they wait for a vacant spot in hospitals. Doctors, however, have prohibited the use of oxygen cylinders at home without medical supervision or prescription.Almost 10% of patients, especially those suffering from asthma and cardiac ailments, need oxygen support as Covid-19 is a respiratory infection that affects the lungs, leading to low oxygen saturation levels. While oxygen saturation level for most healthy individuals is around 95% — meaning at least 95% of the blood in the body carries oxygen – it can drop to as low as 75% among Covid-19 patients and cause death. With the cases rising each day, most hospitals are flooded with patients. Currently, 3,424 of the 4,650 beds with oxygen are occupied across city hospitals. The scale of the outbreak has resulted in patients being forced to wait for hours – stretching to days at times – which can lower oxygen saturation among patients. Consequently, many families are stocking up portable oxygen bottles as a precautionary measure. According to the All Food and Drug Licence Holder Foundation (AFDLHF), the demand for oxygen cylinders and bottles in the past one month alone has gone up by 70%.Nidhi Salvi, a 61-year-old resident of Sion Koliwada, developed fever with breathlessness on May 29. She took over-the-counter medicines, but her condition started to deteriorate soon. On calling the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) helpline number (1916), Salvi was placed 53rd on the waiting list. “She was struggling to breathe. We then rushed to a nearby medical store and rented an oxygen cylinder to aid her breathing. The shopkeeper, through a video call, helped me set up the machine,” said Surendra, Salvi’s 39-year-old son. After waiting for 34 hours, she finally got a bed at the Lokmanya Tilak Municipal General Hospital, also known as Sion Hospital. Having received oxygen supply, her saturation level didn’t fall below 90%. “On hospitalisation, the doctor told that my mother had developed pneumonia, but she survived due to the oxygen provided,” said Surendra.Non-profit organisation NESH (Nobody Ever Sleeps Hungry) that supplies oxygen cylinders in five wards (A, B, C, D and E) stretching from Nariman Point to Mumbai Central receives more than 50 calls every day. “Other than hospital beds, finding an ambulance on time is a struggle. In order to save time, we started an oxygen facility. We guide families on how to use it via video calls. With growing awareness, we have also begun getting orders from people from far-off locations,” said Zohar Diwan, founder, NESH.NESH provides oxygen on the basis of doctor’s prescription. “Doctors mention the amount of oxygen required and we provide the cylinder accordingly and guide them,” said Diwan. “Family members are instructed to regulate the knob according to the markings on the cylinder.”A user has to give a refundable security deposit of ₹4,000 and a charge of ₹400 has been fixed for every cylinder. However, the service is free for people who can’t afford it. “The growing fear of Covid-19 is resulting in many people developing breathlessness, which further adds to the panic and leads to stocking up of portable oxygen bottles at home,” said Abhay Pandey, national president, AFDLHF.“If oxygen is supplied inappropriately, a patient can even die from oxygen toxication. Families of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease need to be more careful. I don’t recommend home-based oxygen therapy. Oxygen is a harmful drug,” said Dr Sundeep Salvi, director of Chest Research Foundation.“We are focusing on increasing ward-wise supply of oxygen. We have installed portable oxygen units at different wards. At K-ward, we have installed 15 oxygen concentrators for patients with breathlessness,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/families-of-covid-19-patients-stock-up-on-oxygen-cylinders/story-CLtoFZGcI6jStyyi5AwiBL.html

11-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh administration sets up committee to control overcrowding at PGIMER||The UT administration has formed a committee under the director of Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) to suggest guidelines for inter and intra state referral system among hospitals.UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta said so far there was no policy document laying down the categories of patients that should be referred from primary or secondary hospitals within Chandigarh and from the neighbouring states to PGIMER. The committee is expected to design a protocol and prepare a system so that overcrowding at the institute can be controlled. Health representatives from the nearby states will also be a part of this committee. UT spokesperson in a press release said that a committee with representatives from Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, and Government Multispecialty Hospital, Sector 16, has been approved by the UT administrator to formulate a protocol to ensure that there is no overcrowding or congestion of patients.The committee will also recommend how Chandigarh can be developed to emerge as an ideal medical hub for the northern region. Earlier, PGIMER had said that despite repeated requests, non-serious cases were still coming in from neighbouring states, including some infected with Covid-19. The UT adviser was then asked to take up the matter with other states, so that patients who could be locally treated needn’t be referred to PGIMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-administration-sets-up-committee-to-control-overcrowding-at-pgimer/story-jLxJFVe34LLxriIG0wogmJ.html
11-06-2020||Mumbai||Amid suspected Wuhan wet market link, Centre issues rules for import, possession of exotic species||The wildlife division of the Union environment ministry has issued rules for dealing with the import of exotic species and will assess the existing scale of possession within the country.The Centre intends to streamline the process by officially identifying those handling such species or involved in their legal trade, as per mandates of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which India is a signatory to. Exotic live species are both plants and animals that are moved from their source (original) habitat to a new one due to human intervention.The decision comes in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, its suggested linkage with wet markets in China, and the zoonotic factor, said Soumitra Dasgupta, inspector general of forests (wildlife), Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC). He added that the advisory, a copy of which HT has, is yet to be officially released to the public. “There are many reasons for creating these guidelines but the Covid-19 pandemic is the primary one. So far there was no mechanism to regulate this, with the chief wildlife wardens (from different states) not in the loop. Things were haphazard,” said Dasgupta. “We are now trying to develop a mechanism wherein genuine importers do not suffer and all levels of the government machinery are aware of the exotic species present in their jurisdiction. This will also allow us an overall control over the possible zoonotic disease transmissions,” he added.The advisory highlights a period of six months (from the date of the official order) to be given for voluntary disclosure for persons in possession of exotic live species in India. The disclosure needs to be made before the chief wildlife warden of each state.“Forest officials will physically verify the submissions, check whether the facilities where the species are being housed are safe, and issue online certificates to owners within another six months from the date of disclosure,” said another senior MoEFCC official. “State chief wildlife wardens have been given the power to take action as they see fit for any violations.”For import of live exotic species, a license needs to be obtained from the Director-General of Foreign Trade along with a no-objection certificate from the chief wildlife warden of the respective state. “Those intending to import have to obtain a health certificate from the national health agency of the country of origin from where the species is being brought, indicating that they are free from any diseases, and also carry health cards for each exotic species being imported,” the official said, adding that concerned authorities need to take note of submissions, ensure the safety of species, and avoid contact or breeding with any indigenous species. Prescribed formats for all processes will be provided in the Centre’s final order, and details will be made public on the ministry’s online portal - Parivesh.Experts said this is a welcome step towards curbing illegal exotic wildlife trade in India. “These regulations will act as deterrents for both, buyers and sellers. We hope more measures follow which further help strengthen these regulations,” said Jose Louies, deputy director and chief of the wildlife crime control division at Wildlife Trust of India (WTI).Dr Neil D’Cruze, head (wildlife research), UK-based group World Animal Protection, said, “Covid-19 is understandably bringing the import of wild animals for commercial purposes under increasing scrutiny. Any steps to improve information on exotic species imported into India should be welcomed. However, there will always be some degree of risk, both, to animal welfare and public health, when non-native species are imported.”Others said the regulations were needed long ago. “Some non-license holders may have been misusing this trade channel for a long time. It is long overdue that we needed to be aware of the source of exotic species being brought to cities without any safeguards, that may have a potential health threat,” said Ravi Singh, secretary-general and chief executive officer, WWF-India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/amid-suspected-wuhan-wet-market-link-centre-issues-rules-for-import-possession-of-exotic-species/story-kKmzOD5hRLqjDnLyiW4trN.html
11-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai-based consumer body urges aviation minister to issue fresh advisory for air travel refunds||Mumbai Grahak Panchayat (MGP), a non-government organisation for consumer protection, has written to aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri to issue fresh advisories to airlines and travel portals for air travel refunds in view of the June 4 United Nations (UN) guidelines. Referring to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)’s uniform guidelines for all UN member states, MGP on Tuesday requested the government to protect the rights of consumers by directing airlines to offer full refund on air tickets without cancellation charges on flights that did not operate due to government restrictions (even if the passengers have not applied for refund) and the ones who had to cancel their flight journey because of Covid-19. It also asked the government to offer credit vouchers with extended validity only if it is acceptable to passengers. Currently, airlines are offering credit vouchers that are valid up to one year for the same sector. For instance, a passenger who had booked a Mumbai- Delhi flight for May 15 can fly until May 15, 2021 with no change in the destination airport along with additional ticket charges if applicable. However, UNCTAD guidelines, issued last week, ask airlines to be fair to the consumers. MGP had earlier requested UNCTAD for the same in the interest of consumer rights. The NGO had requested UNCTAD to consider issuing uniform guidelines to UN member states to issue advisory for airlines protecting consumers’ right to refund and at the same time consider making the financial burden of airlines lighter by offering more flexible, transferable credit vouchers with longer validity without making it compulsory. MGP in the letter to the minister said, “We are very happy to inform you that UNCTAD secretariat has acceded our request and has issued guidelines dated 4th June 2020 for the UN member states (Copy enclosed herewith) which, in short, wants airlines to respect air passengers’ right to refund for flights cancelled due to lockdown and says that airlines should not deny refund of ticket amounts. Taking note of difficulties faced by airlines, UNCTAD guidelines also state that airlines may issue credit vouchers, on more attractive terms, for those passengers who are willing to accept the same.”The Union ministry of civil aviation (MoCA) had on April 16 directed airlines to refund ticket amounts to passengers without levying cancellation charges. However, the directions have not been seen to be followed by the airlines. MGP urged Puri to refund the amount for passengers who booked the tickets not only during lockdown but also pre-lockdown and extended periods. The body has, hence, asked Puri to issue new revised guidelines for refund on air tickets for the flights which could not operate during lockdown period and also for the passengers, who had cancelled their travel plans as per government’s advisories. MGP had conducted a seven-day online survey of air passengers from India, the UAE, Kuwait, Georgia, France, the UK, the USA and Canada. The findings of the survey showed that 86% of respondents insisted on cash refund only and rejected the option of credit voucher. “The Survey has also revealed that large numbers of air travellers are contemplating to go to court of law for seeking legitimate refund. We are attaching herewith the important findings of this survey for your information,” said advocate Shirish Deshpande, chairman of MGP. MGP also suggested that the minister arrange a meeting with all the stakeholders, including all domestic and international airlines, travel agents and travel web portals by the ministry, within a week to discuss a mutually-accepted solution in the passenger’s interest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-based-consumer-body-urges-aviation-minister-to-issue-fresh-advisory-for-air-travel-refunds/story-A1OYELSvbV9PvzOvXZseRJ.html
11-06-2020||Mumbai||Despite price cap, private hsopitals continue to overcharge Covid patients||While complaints continue to come in against private hospitals who are overcharging patients for Covid-19 treatment, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has tasked five bureaucrats with ensuring beds in private hospitals are made available to Covid-19 patients.On May 21, the state capped the treatment price for Covid-19 patients in private hospitals. The charges for a bed in isolation ward cannot be more than Rs 4,000 a day. The maximum charge for treatment in the intensive care unit (ICU) is ₹7,500 a day, and for those on ventilators, the charge is capped at ₹9,000 a day. These amounts include drugs, doctor’s consultation fees, nursing, food and bed charges, but exclude tests for Covid-19, personal protective equipment (PPE), the cost of expensive drugs like Tocilizumab, and certain scans.Despite this, some private hospitals are continuing to charge patients over ₹50,000 a day. One of the reasons for the inflated prices is that hospitals are ignoring the state’s guidelines and continuing to charge more than 10% of the net procurement cost for items like PPE, pacemakers, stents, catheters and medical implants.After 31-year-old homeopathic doctor Dr Mithlesh Singh succumbed to Covid-19 on Monday, his family was given a bill of ₹6,28,000 for 12 days of treatment. He had been admitted to KJ Somaiya Hospital on May 28 and was immediately kept under ventilation. Despite repeated calls and messages, Dr VA Sabnis, dean of the hospital, did not respond. On June 2, 36-year-old Asma Anwar Shaikh was admitted to MH Saboo Siddique Maternity and General Hospital at around 4pm. On June 3, approximately 19 hours after admission, she was declared dead. Shaikh’s family was charged ₹45,000. The charges in the hospital bill included Rs 4,000 for “disposable Covid”; ₹12,000 for “disposal kit”; ₹3,000 for disposable masks. In addition to charging ₹7,500 for a bed in ICU, the hospital charged ₹3,000 for the ventilator, ₹3,010 for oxygen and ₹3,000 for intubation.Dr Nazir, administration head of the hospital, said, “We have charged the patient according to protocol. We can’t pay the money for disposable items from our pockets.”Activist Jitendra Tandel of Rugna Kalyan Seva Samajik Sanstha, who has filed a complaint to the state health department about overcharging at private hospitals, said that there was a need for a protocol to monitor hospitals that are violating rules of the Epidemic Diseases Act. “The state health minister announced patients will be provided treatment free of cost, but it hasn’t been implemented yet,” he added.Dr Sudhakar Shinde, chief executive officer of Mahatma Jyotiba Phule Jan Arogya Yojana, said, “We are planning to start a helpline number for people to register complaints if they are charged more than the capped amount.” Shinde also said, “At present, district collectors are given the responsibility to hear complaints about overcharging at private hospitals.”Meanwhile, responding to complaints about the unavailability of beds at private hospitals, BMC commissioner IS Chahal has assigned five Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers with the task of ensuring private hospitals make beds available to Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-price-cap-private-hsopitals-continue-to-overcharge-covid-patients/story-oK3cEkkrP0VI2C8KeWNn9H.html
11-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai gets 500 more ICU beds||Anticipating a rise in Covid-19 cases in the coming days, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to add 500 more intensive care unit (ICU) beds to boost the capacity by 40% by the end of the month. The current ICU bed capacity is 1,164, with 99% occupancy. Experts feel the current capacity of ICU beds is not enough, considering the number of cases that require immediate ICU attention.Municipal commissioner IS Chahal said, “By the end of this month, we will add 500 more ICU beds to the existing capacity. A total of 300 beds will be added in the next 10 days and 200 will be added by June 30.”The city witnessed 97 deaths on Wednesday, the highest number of fatalities recorded so far, taking the toll to 1,855. It recorded 1,567 cases, which took the count to 52,667. Of the total, 26,178 cases are active.BMC, however, said the situation is under control, as the doubling rate has increased to 24.5 days from 11 days at the start of May.Clarence Pinto, a health activist, said, “As the lockdown is being lifted, the number of patients will definitely go up. At least 10% of the total cases [which would be 2,617, considering the total number of current active cases] would require ICU attention. There are cases where patients are travelling a distance in ambulances just to find ICU beds. The current capacity is definitely not enough.”The total number of completely or partly sealed buildings has reached 4,538. The highest number of sealed buildings, 443, is in F-North ward which includes Matunga, King’s Circle and Sion. The total number of containment zones has gone up to 798, of which a majority (116) are located in R-North ward, which comprises Dahisar and Borivli.In what seems to be a good sign, Dharavi continues to show a decline in the number of cases. On Wednesday, 11 cases were reported in Dharavi, bringing the total to 1,964. The G-North ward (Dharavi-Dadar-Mahim) has so far reported 3,111 cases and 100 deaths. After 10 days, two deaths were recorded in Dharavi and one in Mahim on Wednesday.Chahal also said Mumbai has not seen a single death due to unavailability of dialysis procedure in the past 20 days. Unavailability of dialysis procedure for Covid and non-Covid patients was a major cause for concern for BMC, and was adding to mortality in Covid-19 patients.The chaos was mainly due to lack of clarity among hospitals on handling Covid-19 patients who come for dialysis. The Union Health Ministry’s guidelines for dialysis of Covid-19 patients says they are a “vulnerable group because of their existing comorbidities, repeated unavoidable exposure to hospital environment and immunosuppressed state...”Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, said, “We have streamlined the entire process for those in need of dialysis, by issuing guidelines to hospitals and all others concerned. Due to our efforts, we have not got any complaints in the past 20 days. Complaints came earlier because there was no clarity, but we have worked on it.”By May 26, BMC had also started a dashboard for bed management for dialysis patients, so doctors could refer patients to those hospitals. In a video-conference with the media, Chahal had said BMC had managed to bring down the mortality rate in Mumbai, which hovered around 6% in March and April, to 3.2% by the end of May, due to reasons that included greater care toward Covid-19 patients on dialysis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-gets-500-more-icu-beds/story-K7pFIcwuPEFB0rCRoCWQsO.html

11-06-2020||Chandigarh||Paddy transplantation begins on a slow note in Punjab, labour cost goes up||Farmers in Punjab started paddy transplantation on a slow note on Wednesday due to the shortage of labour as the bulk of migrant workers have returned to their home states in the wake of the coronavirus-induced lockdown.Field reports suggested that the new method of direct seeding rice (DSR) was preferred by a large number of farmers over transplantation by traditional way of sowing saplings in puddled fields. Several farmers complained of increase in labour costs by at least 50% this time as they are relying on local farmhands who are demanding more wages. With a view to staggering paddy transplantation to contain the spread of virus, transplanting was allowed from June 10, advancing it by 10 days from June 20, as was done in the previous kharif seasons.In the last kharif season, the average rate for transplantation of paddy on an acre was ₹3,000, which has now has gone up to ₹5,000 this year.Secretary (agriculture) KS Pannu said, “Nearly 10 lakh migrant labourers worked in Punjab during the previous paddy-sowing seasons. Now, the state has only 1 lakh of them engaged in potato harvest in Ludhiana, Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, SBS Nagar and Kapurthala districts. But we will manage the operations comfortably and as did with wheat procurement even as we are facing acute shortage of labour.”“There is no doubt that paddy will be sown within the stipulated time, i.e. up to July 31, but the cost will go up for the farmers. Who will compensate for that?” asked Balbir Singh Rajewal, head of a faction of the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU).The DSR method of paddy sowing was recommended by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU), Ludhiana, due to labour shortage. The state agriculture department has proposed to bring 12 lakh acres under the DSR system. PAU has also suggested PR 126 as a DSR variety.“The farmers have welcomed the new method which will help save time, money and groundwater,” Pannu said.Also, the number of mechanised paddy transplantation machines has doubled to about 1,200 this year, said director (agriculture) Sutantar Kumar Airi.Also, the farmers are opting for crop diversification due to the shortage of labour. The area under basmati is expected to increase by 5-7 lakh acres, said agriculture department officers.The rise in demand for aromatic variety of rice in international markets will play a key role in growers increasing area under basmati.GFXAREA UNDER CULTIVATION• 66 lakh acre: Expected area under paddy cultivation this season• 72 lakh acre: Area under paddy cultivation in Punjab last year• 17 lakh acre: Expected paddy sowing with DSR method• 17 lakh acre: Area expected to be under basmati cultivationFARMHANDS:• 10 lakh: Migrant labourers engaged in kharif sowing till last year• 1 lakh: Migrant labourers available this year||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/paddy-transplantation-begins-on-a-slow-note-in-punjab-labour-cost-goes-up/story-l2MM7AbntMyzILkbUjoiGM.html

The 58-year-old had tested positive for Covid-19 two weeks ago and was on a ventilator at a private hospital in Mumbai since then.The Kalwa corporator’s death comes soon after a Shiv Sena corporator from Mira-Bhayander Municipal Corporation died from Covid-19 on Tuesday. “He had gone to the hospital to help a Covid-positive patient get admitted. Two days after this incident he developed symptoms like fever. He got a test done immediately and admitted himself to a private hospital in Thane. As soon as the reports came positive he was shifted to Mumbai. As he had comorbidities like diabetes and blood pressure problems, he was on a ventilator since the day he was admitted,” said an NCP worker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ncp-corporator-from-kalwa-in-thane-succumbs-to-covid-19/story-eLETDn379tm34PXMmZ5KTI.html
11-06-2020||Chandigarh||Screening returnees: Chandigarh wants common strategy for tricity||The UT administration will devise a common policy in coordination with governments of the neighbouring states of Punjab and Haryana to ensure screening of people returning to the tricity, which includes Chandigarh, Mohali and Panchkula.The decision was taken on Wednesday amid Covid-19 cases crossing the 500 mark in the tricity following a spike in infection reported among people arriving here through various modes of transport with easing of restrictions on interstate movement.Punjab governor and UT administrator VPS Badnore has directed the UT officials to coordinate with the neighbouring states to formulate the common strategy.UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said: “Chandigarh, Punjab and Haryana follow different policies regarding quarantine and testing of passengers. There is a need to have a synergistic policy to contain the spread of infection due to interstate movement of people.”Significantly, while Mohali has advised home quarantine to domestic fliers, the Panchkula administration has decided to test all people returning from red zones.“The policy will be devised for passengers coming through all modes of transport. After screening at different entry points to the tricity, including the airport, bus stands and railway stations, a list can be exchanged of such persons travelling within the three cities,” said Parida.UT health secretary will be heading the committee formed for the purpose, which will also comprise Panchkula and Mohali deputy commissioners besides and medical experts.The total number of Covid-19 cases in the tricity stand at 511. Chandigarh, at 328 cases, has witnessed a surge in infections being reported from outside containment zones, including Sectors 16, 18, 21 and 41.A similar trend is being seen in Mohali. For instance, of the three men reported positive on Wednesday, two have returned from other states. The total count stands at 140. Panchkula reported its first case on March 21 and was on the road to recovery when it witnessed a spike in the past one week with majority of the cases among people having a travel history. On Sunday, all the four cases had travel history. On Tuesday, two of the five cases had travel history. At present, the district’s total stands at 43.“Better coordination within the three districts will help to track people coming from different hotspots. The spread of virus within the community will be restricted by better communication and coordination within the tricity,” said Dr Ravindra Khaiwal, a community health expert at the PGIMER.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/screening-returnees-chandigarh-wants-common-strategy-for-tricity/story-tqSNqrWy4Ap3BPSiYCvztL.html

These police stations will become operational in January next year. Police said construction of Badshahpur and Rajendra Park police station which is planned in next phase will also begin soon.Police commissioner Muhammad Akil said that under the new stations are part of the force’s modernisation scheme. “These police stations required a modern facility and proper structure for police personnel. They were operating from very old structure and the condition was in a dilapidated state. The premises will be landscaped and electrified adequately for ensuring smooth functioning of the police station,” he said.The police infrastructure is being built by Haryana Police Housing Corporation at a cost of ₹114.34 crore at different locations and police lines across the state. The project includes the construction of 300 apartments for police personnel in Bhondsi, police lines Manesar and Gurugram.Akil said up-gradation of police infrastructure would also help in ensuring safety and security with the active cooperation of general public.The areas in the city are witnessing rapid urbanisation with thousands of residents moving in every year. The area’s population is expected to increase in near future as majority residential projects in the area have reached the completion stage, so we need to expand the police station area and facilities for the residents, said Akil.The project includes a double-story building and 50-space parking lot, nearly the size of 12,000-square-foot for each police station.The construction work had held due to the lockdown and have restarted last month, the buildings are likely to get ready before January 2021, said police.Last year, the state government had announced the construction of the police stations in the city. At present, there are nearly 6,000 police personnel serving in 41 police stations apart from special branches.Construction of a new and improved police station will feature an exercise room, crèche, and a recreational activity room, said police.The new police station will have around 50 personnel, including officers who have served with various crime units.Over the last year, the city police have been opening more police stations in newer areas of Gurugram because of large-scale expansion and urbanisation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-to-get-6-new-stations-by-january-under-modernisation-scheme/story-OFv2c07t38lU8MTqTcZUiI.html

The total population of nearly 50,000 in these 10 gram panchayats are safe from Covid-19 said, Dr Sushma Mullick, medical officer, primary health centre (PHC), Virar. “We took measures including putting a ban on entry from Mumbai and nearby areas as these villages often see crowding in the resorts during weekends,” said Sunil Gharat, a farmer from Khanivade. “We followed the lockdown with discipline and ensured that no one entered or left the villages besides sand carting and other small jobs,” said Gharat.The respective sarpanches of these villages started a campaign to educate the residents by putting posters, conducting door-to-door campaigns to educate people about Covid-19, said Pravin Nalawade, another resident. “We also told the residents to rush to the nearest PHC if they have any symptoms,” he said. He added that a majority of resort owners had called their families from Mumbai to stay in the resorts, but they were subsequently advised not to venture out of their homes for fear of spread of the infection. “We also advised them to be in self-isolation in the resorts itself as a precaution. The resort owners agreed and obeyed the gram panchayat orders,” he said.“We will continue to obey discipline and follow all instructions until the lockdown is lifted and ensure that the infection does not enter these 10 gram panchayats,” said Dr Mullick.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-virar-villages-remain-safe-with-zero-covid-cases/story-2UESg3cvwFcPcHNTtaIZ9I.html

Currently, the district has around 700 dedicated Covid-19 beds but with number of cases rising every day, the administration want to have additional beds ready to accommodate the patients.GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY said the fifth Covid-19 facility (L-1 category) at the Noida Institute of Medical Sciences (NIMS), with 200 beds, has been made operational recently. “We have already started the process to increase the number of beds from 50 to 150 at the Super Specialty Paediatric Hospital and Post Graduate Teaching Institute (Child PGI). Among other Covid-19 facilities, we have 200 beds at Sharda Hospital in Greater Noida, 150 beds at the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) and 100 beds at Kailash Hospital. With this, a total of 700 beds are already available for Covid-19 patients in the district and 100 additional beds will be available soon at Child PGI,” he said.Suhas further said the district administration will take care of Covid-19 patients in an effective manner. “To cope with any emergency, we have plans to take number of dedicated beds for Covid-19 patients to at least 1,000. Talks are already on with many super speciality private hospitals and nursing homes in the district in this connection. The hospitals have also shown keen interest in developing exclusive facilities for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. I hope that a systematic price cap will be determined for treatment in private hospitals,” he said.The DM also said all private and government hospitals have been asked to ensure that patients, coming to the emergency and other wards, must be treated without delay. “If any hospital has any difficulty in treating the patient, they can refer him/her to hospitals with better health care facilities. But, before referring these patients, that hospital will have to properly co-ordinate with the referral hospital so that the patients does not suffer. However, the standard protocol for Covid-19 will be followed at every step by all hospitals,” he said.The DM also said Dr Rakesh Gupta, director of Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida, has been assigned the task of training medical personnel on Covid-19 protocols.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/district-administration-to-increase-beds-to-1-000-in-gb-nagar/story-WZ1TzucEzRpTYwAx8kS4EM.html

However, its performance has dipped as the premier institute dropped 20 ranks in the list - from 152nd position in 2020 to 172 in the 2021 list. The QS World Rankings are announced a year in advance. Though overall rankings have been announced, other lists based on employability, subject-wise rankings will be released over the next few months. This year, QS revealed that their work was delayed due to the Covid-19 pandemic.The only two other institutes making into top 200 are Bengaluru’s Indian Institute of Science (IISc) at the 154th position from 184th rank last year and Indian Institute of Technology-Delhi on the 193rd position, down from the 182nd rank it held in the 2020 list.“While IIT-B is pleased to have retained the number one position in India, the drop in global rankings is something we are concerned about. It appears to be linked to the Academic Reputation (AR) portion of the rankings which constitute 40% of the total score. Our AR score remained close to last year’s so we will take this up with QS,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-B. He added that the institute’s student-faculty ratio has also dropped due to the introduction of the category for economically weaker section, which is likely to have affected the overall score.Surprisingly, University of Mumbai (MU) has no mention in the list this year. Last year, the varsity was placed between 801-850 ranking, but the university does not reflect anywhere on the list this year.The performance of universities is measured on various parameters such as academic reputation, employer reputation, citation per faculty, faculty-student ratio, international faculty and international students.Other institutes making it into the QS Rankings list this year include IIT-Madras and IIT-Kharagpur, both institutes witnessing a drop in their rankings. While IIT-Madras has dropped four spots and stands on the 275th rank this year, IIT-Kharagpur has dropped 33 spots from 281 to the 314 rank this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/iit-bombay-s-position-dips-in-qs-ranking-2021-mu-out-of-the-list/story-7nbMwCeY6NI2HhmJzLOXnK.html

11-06-2020||Noida||Despite open OPDs, hospitals witness negligible turnout of patients||Even as several hospitals and clinics have resumed their out-patient department (OPD) treatment, fewer patients are approaching them, said doctors in the district.The Uttar Pradesh government had relaxed curbs on movement that were in force since the nationwide lockdown from March 25, following central government orders allowing for these restrictions to be lifted in a phased manner in light of the coronavirus pandemic.However, people are still keeping away from places that are, in normal times, crowded. Doctors in Gautam Budh Nagar report that clinics now see mostly pregnant women, while those with other ailments prefer home treatment.Dr. N K Sharma, the president of Noida chapter of Indian Medical Association (IMA), said that people fear contracting the coronavirus disease at hospitals. “Online doctor consultations and prescriptions has increased. Presently only extreme emergency cases are coming to hospitals. Several patients have also delayed their surgeries as it has been mandatory now to conduct Covid-19 test before any surgery,” he said.Echoing similar views, Dr KC Sood, the president of Association of Medical Clinics of Noida, said that patients are refraining to visit even doctors’ clinics. “As per the standard Covid-19 protocol, Covid-19 test is mandatory before admitting a patient in the hospital,” he said.However, Noida-based gynaecologist Dr. Pratibha Singhal said that the OPD at her clinic was unaffected. “Many pregnant women regularly came for their check-ups. However, we are following all safety norms. We are screening their temperature, maintain social distancing and sanitisation measures,” she said. Paediatrician Dr VK Gupta who has his own clinic said that, anecdotal evidence suggested that even the routine vaccination of children has been down by 50% in GB Nagar district, during the lockdown. “Parents preferred to delay vaccinations. Even for other ailments in children, their parents are still not bringing them to clinics,” he said.Patients like 67-year-old Suraj Sharma of sector 34, said that they are now banking on home remedies instead of visiting the clinics and hospitals. “I had a knee pain. I prefer to exercise at home and apply oil. Since it has brought relief, there is no need now to go to hospitals,” he said.Rupali Gupta, another resident of sector 34, said that when her son had complained of stomach pain, she preferred to treat him with traditional home remedies like ajwain (carom seeds). “Earlier, I used to take him to doctor for treatment for any ailment. Now, I fear he may get Covid-19 infection there,” she said.Meanwhile, GB Nagar district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri, also admitted that turnout of patients in different hospitals have come down. “It is very natural during the pandemic times. And, if the patients are not visiting hospitals and clinics for petty issues, it is not a bad phenomenon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/despite-open-opds-hospitals-witness-negligible-turnout-of-patients/story-UcpeAYTxlegCLTHj8TlWpM.html

So far, there have been 31,309 cases of the contagious infection, which has also claimed 984 lives in the national capital.“Data shows Covid-19 cases will significantly increase in Delhi in the coming days; we have a big challenge ahead. Now, we will need a total of 1.5 lakh beds after factoring in those coming from other states. I will get started on this and go to stadiums, banquet halls and hotels to make arrangements. We will try everything, do whatever we can to ensure enough hospital beds in Delhi,” chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Wednesday.Not only is the government working on getting more private hospitals on-board, but it is also planning on expanding its own healthcare infrastructure to match the need.The government is in the process of procuring 30,000 additional beds, according to a senior official from Delhi’s health department. Of these, around 1,200 hospital beds will be in the three newly constructed hospitals in Burari, Ambedkar Nagar, and Dwarka, which are still to open.“The construction of the hospitals in Ambedkar Nagar and Burari are finished and the out-patient department of the Dwarka hospital is also ready to be opened up. So, around 1,200 of these beds will be placed in these three hospitals, with the rest being utilised for the make-shift hospitals the government plans to set up in stadiums, banquet halls, and AC halls,” the official said, asking to stay anonymous.A committee, headed by divisional commission Sanjeev Khirwar has so far suggested the possibility of adding the beds in Pragati Maidan, Talkatora Indoor stadium, Thyagaraj Indoor stadium, Indira Gandhi Indoor stadium, Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium, Dhyanchand National Stadium.

The government’s plan is to add 500 ventilators by mid-July. Of these, 200 are expected to come from the Centre.“The Centre has already provided 75 ventilators that are to be installed in Lok Nayak hospital. Another 75 of the 200 promised ventilators are soon to arrive. In addition, the Delhi government will procure 300 more ventilators. The ventilators will be placed in the hospitals, with oxygen concentrators and high-flow nasal canula attached to oxygen cylinders providing support in the make-shift hospital,” the first official said.Currently, there are about 306 ventilators in government hospitals, according to the first doctors’ panel set-up in March headed by Dr SK Sarin, director of the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.All such make-shift hospitals will be linked to existing hospitals for quick transfer of patients in case someone’s condition deteriorates. To provide oxygen in the make-shift hospitals, the government has already ordered 2,000 oxygen concentrators – a device which selectively removes nitrogen from the ambient air to concentrate it to 93% oxygen and provide a flow of about 5lts/min. “The government is also in talks with manufacturers of oxygen cylinders to ensure adequate supply,” the official said.The government has also ordered 15,000 pulse-oxymetres that will help the doctors in monitoring the oxygen concentration of patients not only in hospitals, make-shift hospitals, but also those under home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-government-to-double-beds-in-state-run-hospitals-by-july-15/story-YcyBhHWz4mzLmvGqYCp5uK.html

In a directive issued to chief secretary Vijay Dev on Wednesday, Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal also asked him to deploy officials to conduct random inspections across all hospitals to check malpractices such as overcharging or false refusal of beds. The L-G is the chairperson of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal is its vice-chairperson.The order read, “In order to increase transparency and to facilitate the public, all major hospitals, clinics and nursing homes of Delhi should be directed to display on LED boards in large letters outside their establishments, at the entry point itself, the availability of beds (both Covid and non-Covid, wherever applicable), along with charges including for rooms/beds and details of the contact person for admission.”Baijal also asked the Delhi health department to ensure the data displayed on the boards is reconciled with data on the Delhi Corona app and delhifightscorona.in web portal. “Further, periodic surprise checks may also be conducted by the officers deputed by the DDMA to ensure that correct data is displayed by hospitals/clinics/nursing homes concerned and no eligible/genuine patient is denied admission or is overcharged,” Baijal’s order further read. The L-G’s order will stand alongside a similar order issued by the state health department on Tuesday, in which the Delhi government had asked all hospitals with 50 beds or more to put up a 12x10-feet flexboard at the entry gate. At the same time, the order issued by the Delhi government on Tuesday stated that the flexboard has to say: “Important Notice. 1) For latest information on vacant beds in this hospital: Download Delhi Corona mobile app. Go to www.delhifightscorona.in/beds. Call 1031. If a hospital refuses a bed even though the app shows there are vacant beds in the hospital, you can call 1031 to file a complaint.”The message further reads, “2) If you have tested positive for corona and your symptoms are mild, then you can recover at home though home isolation. If you do not have sufficient facilities at home to undergo home isolation, you can be admitted to our Covid Care Centre. Only Patients with severe symptoms need to be admitted to the hospital. 3) If you have severe symptoms of corona but have not been tested yet, or if the results are pending, do not panic. Hospitals cannot refuse to admit a patient with severe symptoms of corona.

The stringent restrictions in the area — that was a containment zone for 70 days, after at least 1,080 people of the Tablighi Jamaat tested positive between March and April this year — were eased three days ago.The fear of the virus continued to loom large in the shadowsThe Markaz building, the headquarters of the Tablighi Jamaat from where close to 2,000 participants were evacuated, remains closed. Some civil defence volunteers were still deployed around the area.A majority of shops and eateries in the area remained shut in the area, with very little movement of people, as the area continued to be under ‘strict vigil’ of the district administration.Residents of the area, who had been demanding the opening up of the area for long, said that there was a sense of relief among them.One carriageway on Mathura Road leading to the Basti continues to remain barricaded.Even though the Basti has been de-sealed, the Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah, which attracts visitors from all faiths and is located a stone’s throw away, has decided to remain shut at least till June 13, as a precautionary measure given that the number of Covid-19 cases is on the rise.So far 32,810 cases have been reported from Delhi, as per the health bulletin released by the government on Wednesday, of which 19,581 are active . On April 16, Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain had said that at least 1,080 Covid positive cases were linked to the Tablighi Jamaat (Markaz ) event. Delhi so far has also witnessed 984 deaths (as per the health bulletin) due to the virus.In Nizamuddin, most of the flower and chadar shops (offerings bought by devotees to the dargah) have also remained closed. The market houses a number of eateries, books, perfume and flower shops. For a number of Basti residents, their livelihoods depend on income from these shops.The Basti, which houses at least 25,000 people, was a containment zone for more than two months after the area was declared a Covid-19 hotspot and sealed on March 30. On June 7, the south-east district authorities decided to scale down the restrictions, after no new cases were reported from the area. However, as per the relaxation order, a team of district administration officials, along with local police, were to maintain strict vigil for the next 14 days.Mohammad Saleem, owner of a small biryani outlet in the area, said that many who had rented shops have run out of their businesses. “We struggled to run our houses during the lockdown. Now that the area has been de-sealed, we hoped that people will start visiting again. But even now, shops are not being allowed to open. People have put measures in place but some of the outlets are too small to maintain social distancing. Many of those running eateries out of rented spaces had to shut down, as they couldn’t pay the rent,” he said.Many locals also said that though Urs — commemorating the death anniversary of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, a 14th century Sufi saint — is observed from June 9-13, when a number of people from all faiths gather at the dargah, this year the management committee has decided not to organise any celebrations.“All the entry-exits of the dargah complex have been closed and we have announced that people must pray at home. We will take a decision on whether to open the dargah or not after June 13. The situation is not getting any better and controlling the crowd will be challenging. We do not want another controversy ” said Altamash Nizami, member, Dargah management committee.Residents said that they are not just running out of jobs and savings, but are also faced with the stigma of belonging to a Covid-19 hotspot. “Even though there were no fresh cases reported from the Basti after March, the whole area was contained. Most people depended on NGOs for food and other essential supplies, as the arrangements made by the government were inadequate. The bazaar near the Markaz is still not allowed to be open. Even those who have started going out for work are looked down upon with suspicion,” said Abdur Rahman, a resident, who leads of group of volunteers from the area.Moinuddin Ahmed, a resident and social worker, said that even as the area was sealed, there were many people — employed at the shops and eateries — who started out on foot for their homes states. “During the night when there was less deployment of police, a number of daily wagers started walking for their homes, as they were uncertain for how long the area would remain locked. These have been the toughest few months for people living here,” he said.According to a senior police officer, who did not wish to be named, the barricading has been done as per a decision taken by the district administration for heightened vigil. “The shops can open. We haven’t stopped anyone from doing so. Only eateries, which do not have adequate precautionary measures in place, will not be allowed to open,” the official said.Yasmin Kidwai, the local councillor, said that despite de-sealing, there was a lack of clarity on the issue because of involvement of different agencies. There have been requests from people to allow reopening of shops. “I met the district magistrate in this regard. We had a positive meeting and we hope the issue will be resolved soon.”The sitting MLA from the area Praveen Kumar, too said that people were hassled because of not being able to resume their businesses. “We have requested the district magistrate to allow removal of barricading and reopening of shops after disinfecting the area.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nizamuddin-de-sealed-after-70-days-but-stays-shut/story-4Y0TL5CrUHYfrncV7E5sTK.html
11-06-2020||Lifestyle||Gurugram teens help migrant women keep menstrual hygiene amid Covid-19 pandemic||Zoya, Ishaan, Zaara, Tanya, Sana, Arjun and Aryaman — these 13-15 year olds are no ordinary kids. Unlike youngsters of their age, this group of seven, who are all classmates in Std IX, have started a fund-raising initiative called ‘We Stand by Her’. Zoya Sethi describes the initiative as an “effort to uphold dignity and comfort of migrant women who are making an arduous journey home, on foot.”The campaign aims to raise funds to provide hygienic reusable sanitary napkins to women. Ask how they came by the idea, the teenagers say that they had been constantly discussing the plight of the migrant workers with their parents while spending their days at home. “Many, we know, were helping out migrants with food, water, and ration kits, but no one was providing sanitary pads for women,” adds Zoya. “We did not come across any initiative that was specially for women who would probably get their periods while walking home,” says Sanaa while Ishaan Mittal, another young member of the campaign adds, “We wanted to provide reusable cloth napkins that are biodegradable because they can be used multiple times, and do not harm the environment since they are biodegradable.’’Their search for a partner, to help them in their campaign, led them to Udaipur-based not-for-profit organisation Jatan Sansthan, which runs project Uger — to locally source cotton that is stitched by women to make reusable cotton pads. “We understood that the regular challenges of periods were enhanced by Covid-19 for migrant women. So we subsidised our pads highly, so that they could reach the most marginalised women. Each cloth costs around ₹90 and can be used for 1.5 years,” says Smriti Kedia, co-creator of Uger. She adds that the project allows women to create pads at home, in a safe environment, and also breaks the taboo around menstruation.The group’s classmates and individual donors have rallied for the kids by sharing their initiative on social media. “So far, we have raised over one and a half lakh, and are inching closer towards our initial goal of two lakh. We have provided almost 600 sanitary napkins to the Red Cross Society, which is making kits inclusive of food and sanitary pads for the migrant women,” informs Tanya Malhotra. These kids have no intention of stopping anytime soon. Zoya shares, “We had initially planned to raise two lakh, but now we are gunning for more so that the campaign benefits as many as possible.” Author tweets @bhagat_mallika For more stories follow Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/gurugram-teens-help-migrant-women-keep-menstrual-hygiene-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-6Dknd0o20EDDrWj6o4qeOP.html
11-06-2020||Education||Govt should provide EWS students devices to attend online classes: Schools to HC||Four private schools in the national Capital have told the Delhi High Court that it is the responsibility of the central and the state governments to provide students from the economically weaker section (EWS) with logistics to help them attend online classes during the Covid-19 lockdown.In separate affidavits filed in the Delhi High Court, these four private schools said that they are not obliged to provide free devices such as laptops, smartphones and tablets and Internet facilities to students belonging to the EWS and disadvantaged groups. The submissions were made before a bench of justices Manmohan and Sanjeev Narula while they were hearing a plea filed by Justice For All, an NGO working in the education sector, which had contended that several students belonging to the EWS and disadvantaged groups (DG) were unable to access classes online due to the lack of the aforementioned devices. The court had, on May 8, issued notices to the Centre, the Delhi government, municipal corporations and 10 private unaided schools seeking a response on a plea.Advocate Khagesh Jha, the president of Justice for All and counsel for the petitioner, said, “The court, on Wednesday, directed the central government, state government and remaining private schools to file their responses within two weeks.”A detailed order of the hearing on Wednesday is yet to be uploaded on the Delhi High Court’s website. The matter will be heard next on July 15.A senior DoE official said that they are yet to receive responses of show-cause notices the government had issued on May 8 to 15 schools on this matter. This was following complaints from students that they were not getting any logistical assistance from schools to attend online classes, which had been started after the schools had to close down due to the lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19. In Delhi, the schools have been shut since March 16, but both government and private schools have continued holding classes online.Reacting to the affidavits filed by these four schools, a senior official in the directorate of education said, “We have already informed the court that it is the responsibility of private schools to provide all facilities to EWS/DG students under the Right to Education Act. We will comment only after the court pronounces an order on the matter. It’s still sub-judice.”Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act, 25% seats are reserved for children from the EWS and DG category at the entry-level classes —Nursery, KG and Class 1—in all private schools. The students are entitled to free education, books and uniforms till Class 8 as per the Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-should-provide-ews-students-devices-to-attend-online-classes-schools-to-hc/story-bVOsBL5iZ1YEABuuPdz5EL.html

11-06-2020||Pune||Dengue in the time of Covid: PMC, hospitals geared up to deal with dual health challenge||The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is now looking at another health challenge, that of dengue in the light of the Southwest Monsoon forecast to hit Pune this week.As city hospitals and laboratories are already burdened with Covid-19 cases, the monsoon-borne dengue disease brings a new challenge. Dr Sanjeev Wavare, the civic insecticide department chief said, “We have enough staff and also we have floated tenders to buy insecticide for fumigation to control the spread of dengue and malaria. We have enough manpower and machinery. Most cases start coming in by July and so we will start spraying insecticide in high-risk areas. For corona we spray disinfectants and for dengue and malaria we spray insecticide, so we need difference chemicals for which we are prepared.” As per data from PMC’s health department, in 2018 the city saw 2,943 suspected dengue cases of which, the NIV confirmed 682 samples and two deaths were reported.In 2019, the number of suspected cases went up to 6,040, of which 1,407 were confirmed cases and 10 deaths were recorded.In 2020, 123 suspected cases have been found as of March, of which seven were confirmed and no deaths have been reported as yet.Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director, Sahyadri hospitals, said, “I think that the city hospitals will be able to take the load of dengue, malaria and Chikungunya cases, which are reported annually. Most of these infections are not so severe and those who come to the hospitals come only in case of severe infection. They will be treated in non-Covid-19 wards.”Dr Rao did cite two cases of dual infection – dengue and Covid-19.“Sahyadri has two cases - dengue and Covid-19 infections. Both these infections have no particular medicines and have to be treated based on symptoms. However, the hospitals will be able to tackle the situation efficiently and labs will be able to deliver, as the process of identification for dengue and Covid-19 is completely different,” Dr Rao said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dengue-in-the-time-of-covid-pmc-hospitals-geared-up-to-deal-with-dual-health-challenge/story-tikAsOIiScqvRb04aSiD3L.html

11-06-2020||Pune||Pune man helps 5 grief-stricken Nepal nationals get home||It was a difficult morning for Joseph Monis on Sunday when he received a desperate call from the out-of-work migrants he had been sponsoring during the lockdown. “We can’t stay in this tiny room anymore. Please help us get back home,” said one of the five workers on the phone.​In a single room in Ramnagar area of Balewadi, a group of seven men from Nepal lived through three months of the lockdown. However, only five of them could make their way back home on Tuesday, after Monis arranged for their return. While one of them died in his sleep, another preferred leaving the only accommodation he had rather than spending another minute in the dingy room where one of his temporary roommates had died.​Vijay Parihar, 24, a native of Nepal looked sleep-deprived with swollen red eyes as he recollected waking up to the cold body of his roommate Chandra Monatat Chaudhury, 23, also a native of Nepal, on Saturday morning. His four nephews - Saroj, Prem, Milan and Vishal - looked to him for mental support. They called Monis for help after cremating Chaudhary’s body at an electric crematorium.​Monis, who works in a multinational company (MNC) in the city, posted for help on social media to arrange for five tickets to send these Nepal nationals back home. In two days, Monis was able to gather enough funds to buy bus tickets costing Rs 5,500 per person and finally helped the five workers from Nepal board a bus back to their country on Tuesday.​Vijay worked at restaurant-bar in Balewadi and knew Monis from when he had visited the place. “At 4am that day (Saturday), Chandra said that he wanted to go home and started feeling restless. The room where we stay is small and so, we all sleep close to each other. In the morning around 9am or 10am, we all woke up to find him immobile. I immediately called the person from his village in Nepal who also lives in Pune,” said Vijay.​“They called me early in the morning. I could only reach them after a few hours. Chandra is from the same village where I come from. He had a heart condition and died of a heart attack, the doctor later told me,” said Yamlal Damai, a man who works at a dentist’s office in Aundh and was the closest person Chandra had. ​Chandra had been taken to the Aundh Hospital where his post-mortem was conducted.The body of Chandra remained in the crammed room with one bulb and a barely functional fan as the boys - all below the age of 24 - waited for the ambulance to arrive. “When we realised what had happened, none of us could stop crying out of fear. It was scary to be in the same room. None of us have been able to eat or sleep since then,” said Milan. ​The five relatives were living in an accommodation provided by their employer before coming to this room when the lockdown began and the restaurant temporarily closed for business. The small room cost them Rs 6,000 per month.​“From living in a building, we were moved here. Then, a fellow national brought Chandra to us and one other person. The other person ran away when Chandra died. We would eat whatever little we could buy during the lockdown. Monis provided us some support with weekly supplies. We were hoping to stay back till work started again, but now we just want to go home. Even if we die in the process, at least we will die with family; not like this,” lamented Vijay, while fighting tears.​The boys have left for Nepal and will spend 14 days in quarantine once they reach their village. They hope to return to India some day under better circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-man-helps-5-grief-stricken-nepal-nationals-get-home/story-os65CumA9tAOUkqVJ5DjBL.html

The slums in Koregaon Park have also reported 486 progressive positive cases, of which 278 are active cases currently undergoing treatment. Active cases are patients undergoing treatment for Covid-19, yet to be declared cured and discharged.Progressive positives are total number of people who have tested positive for Covid19 once. This includes active cases, deaths and discharged cases. Under control?The city’s containment zones of Bhavani peth and Dhole Patil road, which were earlier reported double-digit positive cases on a daily basis, are now reporting between five-seven cases daily.PMC commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “This is due to various measures taken in containment zones, which also include early isolation and regressive testing in the entire area. We also focused on elderly patients, comorbid patients and pregnant women. We also provided timely ration kits to each house to ensure that there is restricted movement.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cases-reported-from-safe-zones-in-pune/story-8Mx95MtNVbNWRwrk6PsxLP.html

At the moment, the education department has no fixed time table for conducting classes and teachers are allowed to conduct sessions at any time of the day,” explained Shinde.The classes will be conducted via WhatsApp, YouTube channels, and blogs. The education department is also planning to deliver lectures via radio community channels. The channels will be operated internally by teachers to conduct audio classes. The PCMC education department has asked for its approval to the state government. If required, the PCMC education department will also use cable channels to deliver lectures.For teachers’ guidance, the PCMC education department has created WhatsAapp groups and teachers are being guided on how to conduct online classes.“Students will definitely benefit from online classes.

It is not a wide road - not more than 8-9 feet. There was a dog sitting on the left side of the road. In an attempt to ride past it, he (survivor) moved his vehicle to the right. But as the vehicle approached the spot where the dog was sitting, it got up and moved towards the vehicle. The man turned the vehicle towards the right where the well is situated,” said Mankar.While the woman and her son were sitting in the back seat, the man and their daughter were in the front seat of the car, according to the police.Mankar added that Sachin did not immediately realise that they had fallen into a well. The road is narrow and does not have streetlights or road shoulders near it.“His window was open so he could get out after some time. But he did not immediately realise that it was a well that they had fallen into,” he said. “Some of us (police) reached there and asked him what had happened. He said that when the car fell, he did not realise that it was a well. But as the water started gushing in from his open window, he got out through the window and tried to scramble for the back door but the car started drowning quickly. The back doors of the car were also sliding doors which did not open underwater. He rushed to the nearest inner surface of the well and used the stone-surface to come up. It all happened within split seconds, he told us. We do not know how deep the well is but it was filled,” said Assistant sub inspector Sadashiv Gaikwad of Lonikand police station who was present on the spot.After failed efforts to try pulling his family out of the well, Sachin raised an alarm following which locals gathered at the spot The bodies were recovered after hours of efforts by the locals who called for a crane and brought the car to the surface for long enough to pull the bodies out.However, the car remained submerged in the well until Wednesday afternoon, according to the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/2-children-among-3-of-a-famil-killed-after-their-car-falls-into-well-in-pune/story-Dn1i4OEwObBC3pdd2ng0wI.html
