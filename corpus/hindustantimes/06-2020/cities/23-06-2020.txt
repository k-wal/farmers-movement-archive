23-06-2020||Delhi||No clarity on exams of final year medical students, deployment on Covid duty||The Delhi government’s proposal to deploy final-year postgraduate medical and nursing students to manage intensive care units amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the capital is likely to face hurdles as these students are due to take the final exams, which will end only by mid-July.As at least three postgraduate medical institutes and eight undergraduate and postgraduate nursing institutes in the capital are affiliated to the Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University (GGSIPU), vice-chancellor Dr Mahesh Verma has been tasked with deploying the required number of final-year postgraduate medical students and undergraduate nursing students to hospitals for a period of six months.“We are looking for those who opted for specialities such as pulmonology, anaesthesiology and those who can man the ICUs. MS and MD students are currently appearing for their exams and we can deploy them only once the exams are over. As of now, we are only collecting data and exploring our options,” Verma said.While students of medical colleges affiliated to GGSIPU will take their exams from June 25, those from Delhi University have no clarity on when their exams will begin -- the scheduled exams have been cancelled and no new dates announced so far. Generally, the final-year exams are held in April, which have been delayed this year due to the pandemic and the lockdown it entailed.On Monday, the Delhi government also ordered that medical college students will make follow-up calls to Covid patients who are in home isolation for nine days. This comes a day after a meeting with home minister Amit Shah, wherein recommendations were made to engage third and fourth-year students to improve contact tracing and surveillance.“There are around 600 final-year postgraduate students from the three medical colleges under DU. Currently, none of them is working in any of the hospitals. There is little clarity on when exams will be held. This is a huge loss of manpower, especially during a pandemic,” Dr Saurav Kumar Sinha, member of the Federation of Resident Doctors’ Association (FORDA) and a final-year postgraduate student of Maulana Azad Medical College, said.Another final-year postgraduate student, Dr Sonali Malhotra, said they are stressed by the situation. “There is a lot of uncertainty and we don’t know if we should even be studying right now. We had prepared for exams while working in Covid-19 wards and then they were cancelled on the eve of the scheduled date,” a student of Lady Hardinge Medical College said.FORDA president Dr Shivaji Dev Barman said the association had written to the Medical Council of India, the apex body overseeing medical education in the country, requesting that it consider an internal assessment for declaration of results. “Students are disturbed by the repeated cancellation of exams and the stress of their Covid-19 duties. After the exams, they would go on to become specialists in their fields and this six-month (Covid deployment) period should be considered a part of their senior residency,” he said.VK Paul, the chairman of the board of governors at MCI, said, “Final year exams are important as they will decide the medical specialists we have in the future. We have come up with extended dates and a set of guidelines to hold the exams in the present circumstances, with the use of simulations and case scenarios. Other options can be looked into if the situation demands, but exams are being conducted successfully by several universities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-clarity-on-exams-of-final-year-medical-students-deployment-on-covid-duty/story-KPOqD1hTYCq9EDEFJFt3QN.html
23-06-2020||Delhi||Reluctant patients, burdened doctors at Delhi Covid care centres||For seven Covid-19 positive, but asymptomatic, patients brought to the Delhi government’s Covid Care Centre (CCC) in Narela on Tuesday morning for a clinical examination, the day seemed never-ending. “I have all the facilities for remaining in home quarantine. I don’t know what I’m doing here,” said Dinkar Chopra (36), a resident of Rohini’s Sector 17 and one of the seven patients brought to the CCC.Till evening, the patients remained at the facility even as doctors and district officials debated on whether to keep them at the centre or allow them to return to home isolation. The new round of confusion was triggered by a fresh set of SOPs (standard operating procedures) from Delhi’s lieutenant-governor Monday that mandates sending all mild and asymptomatic patients to CCCs for check-ups. Officials that HT spoke to, on the condition of anonymity, said the new guidelines were quickly turning into a logistics nightmare for the state. With nearly 3,000 new cases being reported every day for the past one week in the national capital, district officials say it is impossible to take so many patients, especially those who are asymptomatic, to the centre just for a screening.“This is a time-consuming process. We can allow these patients to be taken back home only after we get a report from the district surveillance team stating that patients have adequate facilities to remain in home quarantine. It took almost an entire day to get everything done,” Dr Ishrat Kafeel, the chief minister’s representative at the Narela facility, said.Chopra, who is asymptomatic, said he got his RT-PCR test done as a precautionary measure after a few people he came in contact with tested positive for the Covid-19 infection over the past few days. “I got the rapid test done and was advised home isolation after officials inspected and okayed my home. I then suddenly got a call and was brought to Narela for a screening. I have adequate infrastructure to remain in home isolation. I don’t want to stay here,” he said. At the Sultanpuri CCC, the district administration has sent nearly 30 asymptomatic patients. “We are yet to get the report on how many patients could be examined on Tuesday and how many of them were sent home by evening,” a district official, who is part of the surveillance team, said on condition of anonymity.But several CCCs didn’t get a lot of patients for clinical examination on Tuesday. “There have been multiple orders over the past three days. We are trying to streamline the system. We still have patients who were admitted to the CCC after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority ordered five days of mandatory quarantine.” a senior district official said. “Most of these patients want to return home. We are in the process of sending them back but for that, we need a report from the district surveillance team stating that these patients have adequate facilities for home isolation,” the official, quoted above, said.A senior district official said there are only a limited number of ambulances available and these have to be used to ferry serious patients. But the new protocol insists that officials spare ambulances for ferrying asymptomatic patients to CCCs. “Some of the centres are located in far-off places and we can’t take multiple patients in a single trip. These patients then have to wait till the ground report is cleared,” another district official said.At some CCCs, such as the two Delhi government schools at New Friends Colony, no patient was referred for clinical examination on Tuesday. So was the case with the centre at Bakkarwala, where Delhi government’s shelter board flats have been turned into a Covid care facility.District officials said the new guidelines increased the workload of the already overburdened district staff. “Our teams are going to a patient’s home and examining him/her. Today, not many patients were sent to CCC for examination. It is not possible to send everyone to the centre,” a third senior official said.A senior Delhi government official said very few cases could be taken to CCCs Tuesday. “At some centres, there were five patients, while some others had nearly 30 patients. The numbers taken to CCCs are very few when compared to the number of positive cases,” the official, requesting anonymity, said. The person, however, declined to give an overall figure of people taken to CCCs on Tuesday and said the data was being compiled.While screening has become more cumbersome, testing has become easier in the capital with the advent of antigen tests, a more rapid way for testing for Covid-19. At the testing centre in Pilanji village, patients were given reports within 30-45 minutes of sample collection.“Once we get the report, we examine patients and give them the Oximeter test ( to check oxygen levels in blood) to see if they are fit for home isolation,” Sarita Mittal, a doctor with the South Delhi Municipal Corporation and the in-charge of the facility, said.She further said, “I then inform the ASHA workers and surveillance officials who will visit the person’s home and assess if (s)he can be kept in home isolation.”The centre, started on June 18, has tested over 1,000 patients so far, Mittal said. Another centre in Shaheen Bagh, which too started on June 18, sees nearly 100 patients daily.On Tuesday, 16,952 Covid-19 tests were done in Delhi. Until now, over four lakh people have been tested for the virus infection in the national capital, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/reluctant-patients-burdened-doctors-at-delhi-covid-care-centres/story-mDbNejIBVpYSsaYe9ALwyN.html
23-06-2020||Chandigarh||16 years after being allotted Housefed apartments, 52 homeowners wait for possession||Mohali : They invested in category-3 houses in Sector 79 being built by the Punjab State Federation of Cooperative House Building Societies Ltd or Housefed in 2004, after paying full costs of the units, but 16 years later 52 homebuyers are still waiting for possession, forced to live in rented houses.Housefed, which had floated the scheme to build 632 apartments in five categories, promised to hand over possession in 2006.Even though all allottees paid for 140 category-3 apartments in Mohali’s Sector 79, a draw of only 88 apartments was conducted in 2014.The remaining 52 allottees were told that as Housefed did not have enough land to build the units it would hand over possession later. They were also told they could opt for refunds with 10% interest or pay additional costs in case of a price rise.All allottees agreed to pay the increased costs. So, the price of ₹9 lakh in 2004 for a unit went up to ₹19 lakh to ₹21.25 lakh in 2014 when the draw of 88 apartments was conducted.Possession of land in 2018Surprisingly, though Housefed got possession of land – which had been under litigation – to build the units in March 2018, it did not start construction work.“We have been forced in stay in rented accommodation for the last one decade. Despite getting possession of the land, Housefed has done nothing. We request the authorities concerned to sort out the issue,” said Ravinder Dogra, one of the allottees.The costs of the apartment have now increased from ₹20 lakh to ₹35 lakh and the allottees have been asked to pay up. “Why have the costs gone up? Was it our fault?” questions Naresh Trehan, president, Housefed Sangarsh Committee. When contacted, Amarjit Singh, Housefed managing director, said an agreement had already been signed with Punjab Markfed to build the apartments. “We hope to start the construction soon,” he said.About HousefedHousefed was set up in November 17, 1970, to tackle housing shortage in the state by providing financial assistance to individuals to buy/build homes in rural and urban areas.​||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/16-years-after-being-allotted-housefed-apartments-52-homeowners-wait-for-possession/story-wJqzlu2GRa7pDzL3pu20TO.html
23-06-2020||City||Gurugram: Three snatch phone from man, offer to return it for cash||Gurugram: Three men allegedly snatched a mobile phone from a 22-year-old employee of a private company when he was waiting for a commute at Vatika City in Sector 49 on Monday evening. The snatchers offered to return the phone for some money and took the victim to two ATM kiosks, eventually taking off with his handset and ₹11,000 in cash, the police said. The suspects are yet to be identified, the police said.According to the police, the incident took place around 6pm when the victim, a native of Palwal, was waiting for a shared cab near a park. The police said he was playing a mobile game when the three men approached him. In his police complaint, the victim said, “One of the suspects snatched my phone and another pushed me from behind. I assumed that they were armed. They started threatening me and said that if I gave them cash, they would return my phone. They took me to two ATMs. At the first ATM, I withdrew ₹2,000, but they asked for more money. In the second transaction, I withdrew ₹3,000 but they insisted on more and finally I gave them ₹6,000 more.”The police said after taking the cash, the suspects refused to return his phone and decamped in a car, which was parked near the park.Shahid Ahmed, station house officer, Sector 50 police station, said, “The miscreants snatched the victim’s phone and offered to return it for cash, which was a ruse. The suspects are yet to be identified. It is not certain if they were armed and we are examining the footage from CCTV cameras in the area. The preliminary probe has found that they escaped in a sedan.” A case was registered against the three suspects under sections 379 A (punishment for snatching) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of Indian Penal Code at Sector 50 police station on Monday, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-three-snatch-phone-from-man-offer-to-return-it-for-cash/story-uWF11KsfnLrAsGckwpl9TM.html
23-06-2020||Gurugram||Haryana government calls off final semester exams||The state government, on Tuesday, said that it had decided not to go ahead with both the terminal examinations for the final-semester students and those for intermediate-semester students across the state. Examinations for final-semester students in government colleges were earlier scheduled to take place from July 6 onwards.Students will now be promoted based on a combination of 50% weightage of internal assessment marks along with 50% weightage of marks from previous examinations. However, the students will have the option of appearing for examinations for improvement of grades later once normalcy returns to the state. The same procedure will also be applicable for all students of distance education and those studying in private universities.The directive issued by the state government on Tuesday also stated that if a university so wishes, it may conduct online examination, provided that it is fully prepared and equipped for conducting such an examination. The university will also need to ensure that all students are able to take the online examinations.The directive further stated that students with academic arrears in previous examinations may also be exempted from examinations and be promoted to the next semester. Students who are supposed to reappear for papers are to be given marks on the average of the previous examinations for promotion. For first-year students, internal assessment marks may be used for promotion to the next year.Satyamanyu Yadav, principal of Government College in Sector 9, welcomed the decision. Yadav said that the college had raised certain concerns with respect to the earlier decision of conducting physical examinations. “Our college is being used as a quarantine facility by the district administration. We would have required an alternative examination centre had the exams not been called off. The decision will especially help outstation students living outside Gurugram,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-government-calls-off-final-semester-exams/story-KOS3WPWPCuRKoLpOtgxQ8N.html
23-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab readies Covid contingency plan to deal with major outbreak||With the number of the Covid-19 cases and casualties on the rise in the state, the Punjab health department has come up with a contingency plan to deal with the possibility of a major disease outbreak. As per the plan, all asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms will be kept in hostels of various educational institutions. The district administrations have prepared a list of hostels for the purpose. A number of hostels have already been made ready to isolate the patients. Also, according to the plan, patients with co-morbidities (one or more additional conditions often co-occurring with a primary condition) will be immediately shifted to either of three government medical colleges in Patiala, Amritsar and Faridkot or the Punjab Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), Jalandhar, after testing positive for the virus. Patients with moderate symptoms will be treated at civil hospitals.Earlier, when the number of people testing positive for the virus was low, all patients were kept at district hospitals or the special Covid-19 treatment centres set up by the administration concerned. But after a sharp rise in the number of cases this month, the health department was compelled to change the strategy and spare space for patients with moderate and severe symptoms in the government facilities. The situation aggravated after June 1 with 2,098 new cases, including 61 deaths, recorded in the state since. So far, the state’s total tally of cases is 4,397, including 105 deaths. Even as the new guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) stipulate that asymptomatic patients can be kept in home isolation, the state health authorities have decided to keep such persons in institutional quarantine as some people tend to violate home-isolation norms, said a senior health department official tasked with Covid-19 supervision.“There have been instances when asymptomatic patients kept in home isolation broke the quarantine norms and later all of their e family turned out to be positive,” he said.“The idea of the contingency plan is to reduce the risk of keeping patients in a place where we don’t have facilities for the serious stages,” said Punjab Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.MoU SIGNED WITH 3 PRIVATE HOSPITALS The health department has signed a pact with three private healthcare facilities — Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMCH) Ludhiana, Amar Hospital and Sadbhawna Hospital (both in Patiala) to provide tertiary treatment of serious Covid-19 cases. “These hospitals will treat the patients and will be paid by the state government as per the Central Government Health Scheme rates,” said a health department official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-readies-covid-contingency-plan-to-deal-with-major-outbreak/story-cguC0Taa8e9UStBUkYX4GN.html
23-06-2020||Gurugram||Masked men steal ₹1.3 lakh from ATM in Badshahpur||Unidentified thieves stole ₹1.29 lakh from an automated teller machine (ATM) in Badshahpur on Monday night, police said. They added a preliminary probe suggests the suspects, who covered their faces with masks, had used a gas cutter to cut open the ATM.According to the police, the incident was reported to them Tuesday morning. They said around 10.30 pm on Monday, several masked men entered an ATM kiosk, near a bus stand at Darbaripur crossing, and sprayed some chemical on the CCTV to avoid being identified. A police officer privy to the investigation, requesting anonymity, said, “No security guard had been stationed at the ATM kiosk. On the complaint of the bank manager, we have registered a case in the matter. It seems a gas cutter was used to cut open the ATM from which a total of ₹1.29 lakh cash has been stolen.”The police said they were checking footage from CCTV cameras in the vicinity of the kiosk to trace the suspects. A case was registered under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code at Badshahpur police station on Tuesday. This is the third incident of ATMs being targeted in the city after the lockdown restrictions were considerably relaxed last month. Earlier on June 1, thieves had stolen ₹ 42.39 lakh from an ATM in a shopping complex in Sushant Lok. The probe had found that two masked men had entered the ATM kiosk on May 23 and tampered with the machine, eventually decamping with the cash. But the incident was reported a week later when the cash management company noticed a discrepancy during an internal audit. On May 25, masked men had allegedly stolen₹1.5 lakh from an ATM in Sohna. Preet Pal Sangwan, assistant commissioner of police, (ACP), crime, said, “The crime branch has made several arrests in the past two weeks, including a mastermind of the ‘Advani’ gang, who specialise in stealing money from ATMs. Three crime teams have been tasked with tracing the suspects responsible for Monday’s incident.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/masked-men-steal-1-3-lakh-from-atm-in-badshahpur/story-pGPn4pIXelmsJxQDG4uDxO.html
23-06-2020||City||Sanitation workers’ union demands dedicated quarantine centres for staff members||New Delhi: The Delhi commission for safai karamcharis has requested the state government to provide three dedicated quarantine centres -- in east, south and north districts of Delhi -- for sanitation workers who are in the forefront of the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.In two separate letters, sent to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and state social welfare minister Rajendra Pal Gautam on Monday, the commission said, “The safai karamcharis are forefront warriors in the fight against Covid-19 and the Delhi government has announced a compensation to be given to the dependents of safai karamcharis who died while working against the Covid-19.”“Keeping in view the increasing number of Covid-19 cases, we request you to issue directions for the opening three of quarantine centres (100 beds each) for safai karamcharis in south, north and east districts of Delhi. In case a safai karamchari is quarantined in a private hospital, then free-of-cost treatment may be provided to him/her,” the commission said in the letter.Sanjay Gehlot, the chairperson of the commission, said as many as 30 on-duty safai karamcharis have tested positive for Covid-19 and nine have succumbed to the virus so far. “The safai karamcharis cannot afford private hospitals. A worker was recently charged ₹9 lakh by a private hospital for Covid-19 treatment. A majority of these workers live in a oneroom set and they do not have space for self quarantine. We have requested the government to provide a separate facility for them,” he said.A senior government official said it won’t be possible to provide a dedicated quarantine unit in the prevailing circumstances. “The government is providing all possible help to the safai karamcharis. It has also announced a compensation for the families of those who died while on duty. We will give space to them in government facilities if required but separate centres would not be possible,” the official said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sanitation-workers-union-demands-dedicated-quarantine-centres-for-staff-members/story-WP9zRIxLf128dR8wB9COHP.html
23-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram relying on private hospitals to manage expected rise in Covid-19 cases||Facing an infrastructure constraint at government medical facilities in the fight against Covid-19, the Gurugram administration is focusing on building capacities at private hospitals in the district to meet an expected surge in positive cases, particularly after rapid antigen tests are going to start in coming days, officials said.In the next three weeks, that is by July 15, a total of 31 private hospitals in Gurugram are slated to have 252 ICU beds with ventilators, 260 beds without ventilators, 2,912 beds with oxygen and 3,336 isolation beds, according to a ‘preparedness report’ sent to the Centre by the administration on June 18. A copy of the report is with HT.This is up from the existing private capacity of 92 ICU beds with ventilators, 98 beds without ventilators, 785 beds with oxygen and 1,298 isolation beds. From 2,591 dedicated Covid-19 beds at present, Gurugram will have a total of 7,078 such beds by July 15, the district administration’s report suggests. At present, only 16 of 31 private hospitals are engaged in the treatment of Covid-19 patients, with 70 ventilator ICU beds, 61 ICU beds, 410 oxygen beds and 448 isolation beds in use. “The remaining resources will be put to use as the need arises,” said Dr Jai Prakash, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme’s district surveillance officer (DSO) in Gurugram.Meanwhile, four government facilities -- Civil Hospital in Sector 10, ESIC Hospital in Sector 9, a polyclinic in Sector 31 and AIIMS, Badsa (in Jhajjar) -- will remain at their existing capacities of 80 ICU beds without ventilators, 108 beds with oxygen and 130 isolation beds. Surprisingly, there is no ICU beds with ventilators in any government facility in the district, the report suggests. Though AIIMS, Badsa is in Jhajjar district, Covid patients from Gurugram are sent there for treatment, the officials said.The health department is also slated to receive 19 new ambulances, in addition to the current fleet of 31 (which are all under utilisation) by July 15.The officials said that building public health infrastructure is posing a major challenge in Gurugram. “This is true. The Civil Hospital building in Civil Lines is an unsafe structure, so we are operating from a new facility at Sector 10. But there is little space there to expand our bed facilities. In such a scenario, we have to rely on the private sector,” said Prakash.Prakash also clarified that of existing private and public medical facilities, neither are yet overwhelmed. “We have enough capacity to deal with the current active caseload. Even if it increases in coming days, we are prepared to deal with as many as 7,000 active cases by mid-July. With antigen testing going to start soon, we will be able to find even more positive cases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-relying-on-private-hospitals-to-manage-expected-rise-in-covid-19-cases/story-b9corCEu9uHtHPg7TZlL6L.html
23-06-2020||City||As exams near, DU’s visually challenged students keep fingers crossed||New Delhi: Deepak Kumar Gupta, a final-year postgraduate student studying English in St Stephen’s College who has complete visual impairment, is extremely worried as his exams will start from July 1 and he has no help.“Forget about scribes helping us write our papers. During this pandemic, nobody wants to help us cross the roads even. Even if we receive reading material now, we have only a week to prepare for multiple subjects,” he said while speaking over the phone from Nokha, a small town in Rohtas district of Bihar and his native place.“Colleges have said only students in Delhi can be helped with scribes. How can we come to Delhi when there is a visible Covid-19 spike in the city?” said the 23-year-old, who also secured his undergraduate degree from DU.With a week left for the university’s first online open-book exams, Delhi University on Monday asked its colleges and departments to provide assistance to visually challenged students with scribes, reading material, and assistive devices. “The principals of colleges and heads of departments will make their best efforts to arrange scribes for students of Visually impaired appearing for examination as per prior information received from such students as per date sheet notified in OBE mode for academic session 2019-20,” said the notification signed by Dean (Exams) Vinay Gupta on Monday.The development comes after the Delhi High Court last week asked final-year undergraduate and postgraduate visually impaired DU students to try to sit for the open-book online exam, while stating that the cost of any book or assistive device they buy for the examination will be reimbursed up to Rs 2 lakh.The court directed that “the visually impaired students may approach their respective institutes/colleges for any assistance required, including reading material/textbooks in an accessible form and assistive devices”. It said that visually impaired students should be allowed to take a second round of the open book exam in September if they want to improve their score.However, the implementation of the order is proving to be challenging, said SK Rungta, general secretary of the National Federation of the Blind, and a petitioner in the case. “Students have come to us with complaints that the responses they are receiving are not satisfactory and not all required reading material is available in an accessible format,” Rungta said. “They have not been able to study or even attend the online classes and are now expected to appear for their papers.”Preevi Singh, 20, a final-year undergraduate student currently staying in Varanasi, said visually impaired women students might find it particularly difficult to appear for their exams due to multiple reasons, including travelling to Common Service Centres (CSC) providing information technology support or navigating through domestic issues. The English student hasn’t been able to find out her nearest CSC using the link provided by the university since the notification itself is not in the accessible format and neither is the application.“During regular college days, we go to the university’s Equal Opportunity Cell and get our books scanned. That is not possible now. Our college has made efforts to help us but it isn’t enough,” said the Miranda House student. “The move to conduct exams will affect our higher education and employment prospects because the retest, if that happens, will take place in September. Till that time, we have to make do with these results, which will not work out well for us.”Dean (Exams) Vinay Gupta said, “We are coordinating with CSCs to arrange for scribes for students who will not be able to reach Delhi for their papers. As far as reading material is concerned, we have asked principals and heads of the departments to provide reading material to students and have made provisions for students to access Saksham, an NGO that provides online learning material for the visually impaired.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-exams-near-du-s-visually-challenged-students-keep-fingers-crossed/story-48D7BPpBeRKIv7YWDdZ6JM.html
23-06-2020||Delhi||Covid test of pilots delayed, 135 fliers from London stuck at IGI airport for 10 hours||As many as 135 passengers who had landed at the Delhi international airport from Heathrow airport, London, in an Air India’s Vande Bharat flight on Monday, had to wait for more than 10 hours inside the airport terminal as their connecting Air India flight to Chennai was inordinately delayed. While passengers said they were told the flight was delayed because results of the pre-flight Covid-19 tests of the pilots weren’t received on time, Air India maintained that “the delay was because of operational reasons”, without explaining the details.One of the passengers that HT spoke to, Uma Natrajan from Chennai, who had gone to meet her daughter in London and was stuck there because of the lockdown, said she boarded the Air India’s flight from the Heathrow airport around 7.30pm Sunday and arrived at Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport at 8am Monday.“It was a Vande Bharat flight and from Delhi, we had a connecting AI flight to Chennai. Our departure was scheduled at 10.30am. Soon as we landed, we were asked to sit in the waiting lounge and were told that the flight will depart at 12.10pm. After an hour, the time was changed to 2.30pm, then to 4.30 and finally, our flight to Chennai departed Delhi airport around 6.30pm, after a delay of over 10 hours,” Natrajan, a manager at a private firm in Chennai, said.Another passenger who was travelling on the same flight, but did not wish to be named, said because there was no clarity on the departure time and all 135 passengers were getting restless, around 4pm they demanded that the airline manager be called to address them. “The manager came around 4.30pm and told us that the flight has been delayed because the pre-flight Covid-19 tests of the pilots have not yet come in,” the passenger said. Another passenger, 22-year-old student Madhumithaa Sharmila Ramesh Kumar, who studies at a university in the UK, said this was her worst experience with Air India so far. “There were pregnant women and children among the passengers. One of the women had to attend her father’s funeral and she was pleading with airline staff to send her on any available flight, but they didn’t. If the airline officials had told us initially itself that the Covid-19 results of the pilots are awaited, we would have waited patiently. But they gave us no clear answers or explanations, which is unprofessional, “ Kumar said.An airport official, who didn’t wish to be named, also confirmed that the reason behind the delay was that the test results of the pilots had not come in.Air India later said the flight departed the IGI airport at 6.30pm and arrived in Chennai at 8.30pm. An airline spokesperson said due to “last-minute operational reasons, the flight had was delayed”. The airline, however, did not comment on the delay over the test reports.“There were 135 passengers in transit. All efforts were made to minimise the inconvenience to the transit passengers and they were provided refreshments,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/covid-test-of-pilots-delayed-135-fliers-from-london-stuck-at-igi-airport-for-10-hours/story-kAOD68UHKgEJVJfniILa2O.html

The Covid-19 help desks will primarily raise awareness on the disease and will also screen visitors for symptoms of the infection. According to the guidelines released on Tuesday, soon one desk each will be set up at every office of all the departments of the district administration. “One worker will man a help desk for two weeks on a rotation basis, and all the workers will be provided with all the necessary information. They will take all necessary precautions such as wearing masks and gloves, and will be instructed to maintain a distance of almost two metre while interacting with any other person,” the guidelines said.The help desk will be equipped with sanitisers, thermal scanners, and pulse oximeters, which will be used to measure oxygen saturation levels of people who show symptoms of the infection. Workers who will man the help desk will be trained to use the oximeters. “In case the reading on the pulse oximeter is less than 94% for a person, the help desk personnel will be asked to report the matter to the CMO(chief medical officer) office or the nearest CHC (community health centre) or district hospital apart from informing the district toll-free helpline immediately. After every use the device will be thoroughly sanitised with a solution of hydrogen peroxide,” said the guidelines.“Such help desks were already set up in offices of the district health department or the hospitals where Covid patients are being treated. Now they will be there in all government offices in the district,” Rakesh Chauhan, district information officer, said.The in-charges of all offices in the district have also been asked to ensure that any employee suffering from cough, fever, breathlessness, throat infections should be asked to refrain from coming to work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/all-govt-offices-in-gautam-budh-nagar-to-have-covid-19-help-desks/story-0ybFDNvc6E2PjKrMPRt99L.html
23-06-2020||City||No patient will be referred to Meerut without Covid-19 test, say health officials||Ghaziabad: The district health department has decided that it will not refer any non-Covid patients to the government hospital in Meerut without a Covid-19 test. Health officials said that if a patient turns positive for the virus, he/she will be treated at a Covid-dedicated hospital in Ghaziabad itself. The decision comes after 27 Covid-19 related deaths of Ghaziabad have taken place at LLRM Medical College, Meerut, which is also an L3 category Covid hospital. Till June 22, the Ghaziabad district had reported a total of 49 Covid-19 related deaths.“We have started referring only non-Covid patients to the Meerut medical college. These patients were earlier getting referred without testing, but now they will be tested for Covid-19 before any referral to Meerut. There have been cases where non-Covid patients got referred to Meerut and they tested Covid-19 positive there. Later, during the treatment they succumbed to medical conditions as a result of delays in early detection. Since Ghaziabad now has L1, L2 and L3 facilities, such patients will be referred to an appropriate hospital in case they test positive for Covid-19,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad.“Further, the medical college at Meerut is also overburdened as it is receiving patients from other nearby districts of western UP,” he said.Gupta said that for testing of such patients, the district has already started using True-Nat machine installed at Ghaziabad’s MMG Hospital.“True-Nat machine gives result in one hour. It is basically a testing for Covid-19 negative. If the test result is negative, then it is confirmatory negative patient. If the test indicates mild, moderate or highly positive, then confirmatory test has to be taken up through the RT-PCR method and samples need to be sent to a lab. However, we have received 200 kits which can further help us get a confirmatory test in one hour,” CMO said.At present, the Ghaziabad district has two smaller L1 hospitals at Sahibabad (with 76 beds) and Nandgram (60 beds), while Sanjay Nagar Combined District Hospital (100-bedded) is functioning as L2 category hospital. Besides, there is a 400-bed L3 facility at Santosh Medical College.Meanwhile, to enhance the testing capabilities, state officials said that they will be holding a training session for staff members of six districts of western UP, including Ghaziabad and Noida, for antigen testing.“The antigen testing will soon start in six districts of Meerut division, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).Further, in order to bridge the gap of rising number of Covid-19 cases and short availability of L1 category beds in Ghaziabad, the health officials on Tuesday inspected the ongoing furnishing works at Divyajyoti College at Niwari which is proposed to be made operational by Wednesday.“It is proposed for 250 beds. Also, there is a building near the college where we can come up with 150 more beds. So, it has potential to become 400-bed L1 facility and will suffice for another 15 days in wake of rising number of cases. Once it gets started, we will close down 60-bed L1 hospital at Nandgram and shift L1 patients to Niwari. The same team of health care staff will also be shifted to Niwari and we have made arrangements for their stay,” CMO added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-patient-will-be-referred-to-meerut-without-covid-19-test-say-health-officials/story-MPoeeWCzxWY6VCDHtWzIrN.html
23-06-2020||City||UP relaxes sealing norms for high-rises, restricts action to floor of infected person||In a move that would bring relief to thousands of high-rise residents in Noida and Ghaziabad, the Uttar Pradesh government has decided to relax the containment (sealing) norms that come into play when a person tests positive at a high-rise. The officials of the health department of the two NCR districts confirmed that the proposals to amend the rules have been put forward during a recent video conferencing of state officials.According to the proposal, in case a resident tests Covid-19 positive, only the floor of his/her residence will be sealed, as opposed to the current practice of sealing the entire tower. The guidelines have been discussed and forwarded to district officials. In case there are multiple patients, the tower will be marked as a containment zone and other exercises, as per the Covid-19 protocol, will be carried out,” an official from the Ghaziabad health department said.Earlier on May 31, Uttar Pradesh chief secretary RK Tiwari had issued directions relaxing containment area rules as part of the Union government’s Unlock1 plan.The directions said in case there were one or more cases on the same floor of a high-rise, then the particular tower will be sealed. It further stated that in case there were active cases in more than one tower, then the respective towers along with common areas such as gyms, swimming pool, park and banquet hall, etc. will be sealed.Later, on June 14, the state government also relaxed the period of containment, and reduced it to 14 days, from the earlier 21 days. These directions had come after residents raised repeated complaints to officials.Under the latest proposal, the officials said in case of single case, the area within a 250m radius will be marked as a containment zone, while an area within a 500m radius would be sealed of there are more than one case.Both Noida and Ghaziabad are part of the National Capital Region, and are among the 11 districts of Uttar Pradesh with a high number of Covid-19 cases.The health department has also made it mandatory that in every suspected Covid-19 case, the person’s sample for testing is to be collected within 24 hours of the person coming forward.“We are waiting for written directions from state officials regarding the revised containment guidelines,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said.Gautam Budh Nagar health department also said it was waiting for the new guidelines. “Until a written order comes, we cannot start implementing the new guidelines,” a senior health department official said.Residents have welcomed the proposal.“It was a hassle for residents of an entire tower to remain stuck at home, in the event of one person testing positive. Organisations and offices have resumed work and people run the risk of losing jobs if they are unable to move out of home,” Saurabh Kumar, a resident of Nirala Estate in Greater Noida West, said.The residents of the society had protested against the administration sealing an entire tower after a single case of Covid-19 was reported on June 18.The district currently has 282 containment zones most of which are in the urban areas. In Ghaziabad, the officials have identified 244 category 1 containment zones (having single Covid-19 case) and another set of 35 category 2 containment zones (having more than one Covid-19 case).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/up-relaxes-sealing-norms-for-high-rises-restricts-action-to-floor-of-infected-person/story-18DzlWpRRBCCCcSavvk9QI.html

The authority on Monday allotted four plots to private firms in these areas to tide over the growing economic crisis set in motion by the outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. As per officials of the Noida Authority, old industrial sectors of 1-11, 55-59, 63, 67, 82 and Phase-2 no longer have fresh plots for new business activities. The new sectors along the expressway that have better connectivity and infrastructure is likely to witness a substantial industrial growth in the coming months, said officials of the authority. “We have allotted 2,100sq m-sized plots to various industries and have earned a total of ₹12.34 crore in revenue. The four allotment will attract a total investment of ₹35 crore and will create at least 500 new jobs in the city. Sectors like 151, 155, 156, 157 and others along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway are all set to transform into industrial hubs in the coming months. The authority is also working on preparing more industrial land to be allotted ahead,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida Authority.The allotment is a part of a new scheme for industrial development launched by the Noida Authority on January 1, 2020. The scheme was suspended towards February-end and all new allotments were put on hold after the nationwide lockdown came into existence on March 25. The online land allotment scheme restarted in the first week of April “Now with the easing of the lockdown restrictions, we have started selecting successful applicants from a draw of lots. We have plots of several sizes, including 250 metres, 400 metres, 2,100 metres and 4,000 metres or above for this scheme. We will keep allotting plots along the expressway following due procedures,” said Tripathi.In addition to allotting plots, the authority is also carrying out development activities in the new sectors so that industrial units can be quickly set up.“We will start giving possession to those who will start paying the land cost,” said Tripathi.At present, the authority has at least 300 hectares of land for the industrial use. “We are identifying more plots and also working on creating a land bank,” said Tripathi.Apart from this the authority also allotted 4,000sq m plots via an interview process during the lockdown. The big industrial plots are allotted via interview unlike small ones, which are always alloted through draw of lots, said officials.Earlier, on June 16, the authority had earned a total revenue of at least ₹300 crore by allotting 212,745.68 square metres of land across nine industrial plots to different companies. These plots are expected to cumulatively generate over 5,500 jobs over the next two years.“With the earlier and fresh allotments taken together, the authority is expected to earn a total revenue of ₹300 crore, while the city will get around ₹870 crore in investments. These firms are likely to create over 5,600 jobs over the next two years,” said Tripathi.The new firms to whom the allotments have been made will produce sewing equipment, ready-made garments, packaging material, among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-authority-allots-four-new-plots-to-boost-industrial-growth/story-Q3FjEhku4bbfsBztMZjo7H.html
23-06-2020||City||In Bhiwani, nearly 60 recently infected patients traced to local lawyer||Bhiwani district has seen a sudden rise in Covid-19 cases with 108 new infections in the last four days. Most cases are being reported from BTM Line and DC Colony areas in the city.So far, 87 patients have recovered and 224 are active cases in the district.Bhiwani coordinator for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Kumar said nearly 60 patients from BTM Line and DC Colony areas were asymptomatic and contracted the infection from a local lawyer, who had tested positive for coronavirus disease on June 12.“The lawyer was told to home isolate but he moved freely despite having the infection. He even went to the court, following which his assistant also tested positive for Covid-19. Ignoring the health department guidelines, the duo moved freely in BTM Line and its adjoining DC Colony, ending up infecting close to 60 persons, mostly labourers working at the BTM mill,” said Kumar.The district coordinator said all these persons tested positive after sampling was conducted in the said localities after they received the input that the lawyer violated the home isolation rules.“Now, we have sent the lawyer to Bhiwani government hospital. We accept our mistake that he had not only violated the home isolation, but health department guidelines as well. We have not taken any action against the lawyer and his assistant yet. The persons who have come in contact with the patients from both the areas are being tested faster and we are making efforts to stop the spread of infection to other areas,” he added.ROHTAK SEES 97 CASES IN 6 DAYSRohtak has witnessed an outburst of Covid-19 cases as 97 new cases were reported in the district since June 17.Rohtak civil surgeon Dr Anil Birla said the new cases are mostly contacts of infected patients. “After witnessing a sharp rise in infections two weeks ago, the cases are now decreasing.

We have to take a strong position, and we should be clear that if we lose even an inch of land, we must hold them responsible,” he said at the Congress Working Committee (CWC) video-conference convened by the party’s interim president Sonia Gandhi.Amarinder also cornered the Centre over its failure to support the state in its fight against Covid, pointing out that all that Punjab had received so far from the Centre was its own Rs 2,800 crore for January to March period, and just a few other grants. He said that GST dues for April to June were still pending. Despite repeated pleas and memorandums, no help was forthcoming from the Centre to the state government for tackling the Covid crisis, he said, adding that the centre was not giving even the state’s own share.The CM said his government was forced to manage on its own to create resources for fighting Covid. “I am sure other states are in the same unfortunate position. Nobody is listening to us,” he lamented. He said with 2.33 lakh of the total 2.52 lakh industries in Punjab were now open and migrants were also back to the state but the units were currently working at 40% capacity and would take some months to return to their full strength.Speaking of the state’s economic revival plan, Amarinder said the Montek Ahulwalia committee set up to formulate the strategy was sharing its feedback with the government, which was accordingly charting the way forward. The committee has six working teams, of which the finance team had already submitted its report and the others were expected to come in soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/galwan-valley-incident-part-of-larger-chinese-design-amarinder-tells-cwc/story-zbnzmxaaw78e1SOWkqV4ZM.html

The doctors’ move came after health department advised the medical staff of the hospital that doctors should use personal protection equipment for their safety.Following the health department’s advisory, medical superintendent Dr Paras Pandove had issued a notice that doctors and other staff will face disciplinary action if they contract coronavirus ‘due to their negligence’.Dr DS Bhullar, president of the Patiala unit of the Punjab State Medical and Dental Teachers’ Association, said, “The faculty feels unwanted interference in functioning of Rajindra Hospital, which is a tertiary care centre, and receiving all types of cases even when government hospitals in city, which are directly in control of the health department, are not treating corona patients. The district health authorities should stop blaming doctors and medical staff of Rajindra hospital, which is demoralising.”“We strongly object to the allegations of the district health department that medical staff of Rajindra hospital is not adhering to safety guidelines and violating safety protocol,” said Dr Bhullar.Doctors criticise MS’s ordersCriticising the notice, the association leaders said the letter is demoralising for doctors and staff on duties round-the-clock and should be withdrawn. They said directly fixing the responsibility of doctors for getting infected by Covid-19 while performing their professional duties, may have strong negative repercussions.Dr Darshanjit Singh Walia, general secretary of the association, said, “The duty of the doctors and medical staff is to focus on treatment of patients and precautionary measures for public and potentials sources of infection coming to the hospital is to be looked after by the hospital administration, which is dragging its feet by issuing such dictatorial orders and shifting responsibility.”Designate RH or Mata Kaushayala Hospital as Covid hospitalDr Darshanjit Singh Walia said, “Keeping in view recent surge of positive cases in medical staff of the hospital, government should designate either Rajindra Hospital or Mata Kaushayala Hospital as covid hospital to segregate treatment of corona-related and normal patients to protect people and medical staff.Patiala civil surgeon Dr Harish Malhotra said, “We have only advised them to take precautionary measure. We haven’t done anything else.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/medical-education-health-dept-at-loggerheads-in-patiala/story-MoID2EvLPMw4KSM9g1Mc1I.html

For the last six months, there is no coordination between the private schools and UT administration.”50% staff may attend duty from June 29 in govt schoolsGovernment schools in Chandigarh may call 50 % of their staff for duty from June 29. Principals of various city schools have already issued instructions to their staff. However, formal orders from the education department are awaited.

The prison authorities on Tuesday while responding to a concern raised by petitioners that inmates were unable to instruct their lawyers, said that it was decided to allow inmates email access. The decision was part of the draft modified guidelines, pertaining to the safety and well-being of inmates in light of the Covid-19, spreading in some jails.The state also informed the court that postal correspondence with prisoners would also be permitted in non-containment zones, where postal services had resumed. The guidelines also stated that relatives and families of inmates who tested positive for the virus, would be informed within 48-hours and the inmate would be shifted to the quarantine centre set up in temporary jails where he/she would be treated for the infection.The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice MS Karnik while hearing a clutch of public interest litigation (PIL) through video conferencing, was informed by the state and prison authorities that the draft guidelines submitted in the earlier hearing had been modified, after considering the recommendations of the petitioners.Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni who was assisted by additional government pleader Jyoti Chavan informed the bench that the draft guidelines were consistent with the recommendations issued by ICMR and the state health department, from time to time.

He said that it was largely due to violation of social distancing norms.“We have to shun this attitude where rules are followed only if they are enforced. The number of case have risen as people started throwing parties and stopped following social distancing norms,” Dr Mohan said.Dr Bishav, who with Dr Rajesh Mahajan co-authored a book on preventing spread of the virus titled ‘Lets Defeat Covid-19’, said spreading awareness on the virus is the need of the hour.According to them, maintaining proper social distancing of at least one metre between yourself and others and wearing masks properly close to the bridge of the nose all the way under the chin are two most important factors responsible for controlling the spread of Covid-19.“The next 14 days are crucial. Everyone, including government officials, doctors and most importantly people have to show presence of mind. Besides maintaining distance, avoid large gatherings and crowded places. Regularly wash your hands, cover you face with cloth or elbow while coughing or sneezing,” Dr Mohan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/medical-expert-raises-alarm-says-next-14-days-crucial-to-prevent-covid-spread-in-three-punjab-cities/story-xggUFpspgzudNWl5FCwLxM.html

Owner of Basant Restaurants Bhupinder Basant said, “It is a relief for the sector, but the government should extend the timings as customers come for dinner only after 8pm.”The government had allowed restaurants to open on May 8, but only for home delivery of food and takeaways. The operations were allowed till 8pm only.Restaurant owners rued that labour shortage was also a major concern as around 50% of labour of restaurants comes from Nepal. Labourers from the country have also gone back to their home states.Owner of Spice Cube on the Ferozepur Road Inderpal Singh said, “Labour shortage and timings are a major concern for the sector. There is also another confusion. The government has allowed a gathering of up to 50 people for a party in banquet halls. But, the government has also stated that the area of the hall in hotels should be 5,000 sq feet. But, this much space is not available in most of the banquet halls.”President of the Hotel and Restaurant Association Amarvir Singh said, “We welcome the decision. There might be some constraints, but the business would slowly come back on the track. Allowing liquor in weddings would also provide relief to the owners having stocks of liquor or beer.”DECISION GIVES US A HOPE: MARRIAGE PALACE OWNERS Allowed to organise marriages in palaces with a maximum guest limit of 50 persons, owners rued that this would not bring the business back on track, but it is a relief for the sector, which was bearing fixed expenses such as salaries of staff, electricity bills, etc during lockdown.President of the Marriage Palace Welfare Association Amarjit Singh Sant said, “Palaces have been closed shut since March and owners were forced to bear the fixed charges. The future of the sector is gloomy but, with this relief, we will be able to earn revenue for meeting the fixed expenses and it has given us a hope that business would slowly come back on the track.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-eateries-give-thumbs-up-to-resumption-of-dine-in-facility-but-seek-extension-in-timings/story-paX26khsasuAdtOA2UQWmM.html

Though it had emerged as the principal opposition party, the performance was much below expectations and many in the AAP had attributed it to the party’s strategy of going into the elections without a CM-face, besides other reasons.Leader of opposition (LOP) Harpal Singh Cheema said the AAP leaders would attend the all-party meeting convened by the chief minister on Wednesday. “We will strongly register our opposition to the three anti-people ordinances passed by the central government in the name of agriculture reforms,” he said, demanding their immediate withdrawal.He also announced a protest against the state government’s move on Bathinda Thermal Power Plant and gherao of finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal’s residence in the city on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aap-to-contest-2022-assembly-polls-with-cm-face-says-jarnail-singh/story-6mipNW1FqANqR1NhHyGMEL.html

Most of the volunteers did not come to duty on Tuesday in protest.Volunteers lodged a complaint with commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal seeking action.Volunteer Rohit Kumar, 26, alleged the police had beaten him and his brother Shubham Kumar, 23, inside the Division number 4 police station.Rohit’s mother, Pooja, 45, of Vishkarma Colony, said, “I, along with my son, had gone to collect a payment of Rs 2lakh from Daresi on Monday evening. The police stopped us near the old vegetable market in Daresi and asked for vehicle documents. Shubham was not carrying the documents at that time, however, he called Rohit to bring them.”Pooja added, “Even after the documents were produced, the police personnel demanded Rs 200 to allow us to go. After Rohit introduced himself as a police volunteer, the cops started abusing us.”“When the police personnel used derogatory and vulgar language for me, my both sons objected to it. Meanwhile, inspector Satwant Singh, SHO of Division number 4 police station, came and took us to the police station,” she said.Rohit alleged the police personnel slapped his brother for at least 15 times at the police station and beat them up with sticks.He said as soon as other volunteers received this information, they gathered outside the police station and raised slogans.

He said that early identification has proved successful in containing spread of an infection. The health department has issued instructions to civil surgeons that high risk patients will not be admitted at covid care centres (CCC). “Patients at CCCs will be shifted to covid health centres only if they are mild to moderately symptomatic,” said the minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/19-covid-containment-zones-setup-in-8-dists-balbir-sidhu/story-KdFMywgM8LC79tV2h93l6M.html
23-06-2020||City||NCP was keen for alliance with BJP two years ago: Fadnavis||PUNE: Former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday claimed that the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) wanted to join hands with Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) to be part of the government when the latter was already sharing power with the Shiv Sena. The senior BJP leader was speaking to the media after visiting various hospitals and review the Covid-19 situation in the city.Fadnavis, also a Leader of Opposition in state assembly, said when the NCP wanted to join hands with the BJP, the latter’s central leadership was against severing ties with the Shiv Sena.“They (NCP) wanted to join us two years ago. There were meetings in this regard, but our senior leaders made it clear that the BJP will not sever ties with the Shiv Sena. So, the alliance plan hit a roadblock,” he said.The former chief minister said post assembly polls last year, the NCP and the BJP made an attempt to come together.“As we all are fighting against Covid-19, I do not want to raise a political issue but it is true that both BJP and NCP tried to come together. Two meetings were held and I was present at one,” said Fadnavis, adding that currently his party is not interested in pulling down the existing state government.Fadnavis said that he is planning to come up with a book that will give details about his party’s stand and what had happened during the government formation last year post the 2019 assembly polls.“I don’t want to comment more as I plan to pen a book and elaborate the details. I will be meeting deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar and share my observations on various issues related to Pune.”Reacting to Fadnavis’ claim, NCP spokesperson Ankush Kakade said, “His statement is out of frustration. The NCP condemns it. As the Shiv Sena-NCP and Congress are performing well, it is an attempt to create confusion among people even as his comments will not affect the Maha Vikas Aghadhi.”Kakade accused Fadnavis of being political while appreciating the Pune Municipal Corporation and criticising the state government. He said, “Fadnavis is appreciating PMC as his party is working here and criticising the state government. If the state government is responsible for increasing positive cases, the same principle should be applied at the national level. He should blame the prime minister for increasing numbers of Covid-19 cases in the country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ncp-was-keen-for-alliance-with-bjp-two-years-ago-fadnavis/story-ktTl1GFJ3kVqUyi4gKkGwI.html
23-06-2020||Chandigarh||HC refuses to stay mini-bus permit scheme in Punjab||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday refused to stay the Punjab government scheme of granting new mini-bus permits in rural areas.The petition was filed by the existing operators arguing that the proposed policy will lead to wholesale and unchecked grant of mini-bus permits, congest the rural transport market and upset the transport scheme in state.The government on Tuesday argued that the scheme has been floated to check monopoly and undue profiteering in the transport business. Additional advocate general Rameeza Hakeem had contended that the petition was nothing but a ruse to keep new operators out, cartelise rural transport, and maintain the monopoly of current bus operators, many of whom have been operating on routes for past 25 years without healthy competition.As state told court that June 30 deadline for receipt of application was merely for the purpose of administrative convenience, and that the process for granting permits is likely to take some time, the high court bench of justice Rajan Gupta and justice Karamjit Singh deferred the hearing till August 10.The scheme announced during the budget session this year envisages grant of stage carriage permits on 1,400 rural routes to buses up to 35 seats. It was initially notified on March 16 with a deadline of April 16 but later extended up to June 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-refuses-to-stay-mini-bus-permit-scheme-in-punjab/story-2jTNvJGQPCPGTplsTJklSL.html

However, now we have asked the doctors to go for a repeat test based on the symptoms and suspicion. Hopefully, it will help us maintain low level of infection spread among the frontline workers,” Dr Jagat Ram added. An official statement from PGIMER had said that a 42-year-old woman from Kapurthala in Punjab had been brought to the hospital in a critical condition and complaining of breathlessness on June 12. As she had a negative Covid-19 test report she was admitted to the intensive care unit for treatment.However, to verify her condition, the patient was retested at the hospital on June 14 and found to be positive in pool testing. A repeat individual test again came out positive on June 15.This led examination of 70 PGIMER staff and accordingly 17 doctors, 11 nursing officers, two operation theatre technicians and two hospital cleaners were quarantined.All high-risk contacts are quarantined for 14 days from the last day of exposure and will be tested between the seventh and 10th day of quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/retest-negative-cases-if-covid-19-suspected-pgimer-tells-docs/story-yQvacM9aPEVnEYbi5JWzQM.html

When the constable at the entrance checked his temperature with a thermal scanner, he was found to be running a fever.“He then told us that he was suffering from fever and has already been tested positive for Covid-19 by a private diagnostic laboratory. The laboratory informed him over the phone which made him nervous and he approached the police station. He said that he lives alone and got so nervous that he approached the police,” said Khalid.Upon the revelation of the patient’s health condition, panic gripped the entire police station. The man was asked to sit under the shade of a tree in a corner of the garage adjacent to the police station. The health department officials were immediately informed. The area was cordoned off till the ambulance arrived. The man was then sent to a designated Covid hospital.“The place where he was asked to wait has been properly sanitised, the entire police station has been sanitised too. As no police officials came in contact with him we have not asked anyone to go in quarantine,” said a senior official of the police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/told-over-phone-he-is-covid-19-ve-man-walks-into-police-station-for-help/story-QRYYziPOBs6te351qB4Q6O.html

The deaths of her husband Vimal and my younger brother Vipin will haunt us forever,” said Mimic Zadoo, the latter’s elder brother.Stating that ₹10 to 12 lakh could never compensate for a human life, Mimic said, “What about Vaibhav Zadoo?

Doesn’t he deserve to be compensated,” asked Mimic.Presently based in Greater Noida, Mimic is planning to come back to Jammu to look after his 75-year-old father.

The state government had approved a comprehensive plan for setting up an industrial park or a pharmaceutical park which will revitalise and rejuvenate the economy of southern Punjab, he said during a press conference, defending the government’s move.AAP MLAs, led by leader of Opposition Harpal Singh Cheema, staged a protest near the FM’s residence on Monday, accusing the state government of doling out hundreds of acres of the power plant through PUDA.Manpreet said that the state government will make a pitch for one of the three pharma parks being setup by the Centre or establish the industrial park where companies that are relocating from China will be invited.“Water bodies and lakes are spread over 164 acre. Bathinda relies on canals for its water needs and has an existing storage capacity of 10 days of water supply. With the addition of these lakes, Bathinda will increase water supply storage by another 60 days,” he said.The finance minister said that the 280-acre power colony of the thermal power plant will be used to accommodate civil and policy administration, ranging from deputy commissioner to Class-4 employees. He added that not a single employee of the Bathinda power plant, including those on contract or employed through outsourcing, was retrenched and all were accommodated.POWER ENGINEERS OPPOSES LAND ALLOCATION TO PUDA The PSEB Engineers’ Association criticised the decision to allocate land of defunct Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Plant, Bathinda, to PUDA. Association president Jasvir Singh Dhiman said, “The Bathinda unit was renovated from 2004 to 2014 as per CEA guidelines.” Association general secretary Ajay Pal Singh Atwal said the buildings constructed for power sector should have been used only for power sector activities and for further expansion to provide better services to consumers in state and not other purposes. The association said if state is determined to sell it, sufficient time should be given for disposal of valuable machinery installed in the plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bathinda-thermal-plant-move-manpreet-defends-move-says-industrial-park-on-land-a-windfall-for-state/story-Aia8mOcxVL9aaBpVxTiHCJ.html

Sources said the former MP, who is in hospital after falling sick recently, has communicated his decision to resign from the party post to top RJD leaders. “Yes, Raghuvansh ji has resigned from the party post. I cannot comment on it much,” said PK Choudhary, a close aide of the former MP.Earlier on Tuesday, five RJD MLCs -Radha Charan Shah, Sanjay Prasad, Dilip Rai, Md Kamar Alam and Ranvijay Kumar Singh- switched over to the ruling Janata Dal (United), leaving Lalu Prasad Yadav’s party with just thee MLCs in the state legislative Council.Prasad’s move is being seen as a ‘backlash’ as the 75-year-old leader, considered a Rajput face, is reportedly unhappy at the likely induction of former MP Rama Kishore Singh in the party in next few days.Rama Kishore Singh, another Rajput leader from Vaishali, has several criminal cases against him. Political observers feel that his entry –a move by RJD to consolidate its traditional Muslim- Yadav- Rajput combination in the forthcoming assembly polls- could further marginalise Raghuvnash Prasad in the party.On the other hand, Rama Singh said he was all set to join the RJD on June 29. “I will be joining the RJD on June 29. That is confirmed,” he said.Asked about the resignation of Raghuvansh Prasad from the party’s post apparently in protest against his induction in the party, Singh said it was just a ploy by the veteran leader to play pressure politics. “There are many good reasons why Singh is annoyed with my induction in the RJD. But it would not matter as I am a grass roots leader,” he said. He also scoffed at speculations that he or any of his family members could be given a RJD ticket from Mahnar in Vaishali. “I am not joining RJD with any conditions,” the former MP said.Reacting to the reports of Raghuvansh Prasad Singh’s decision to step down, leader of opposition in Bihar assembly, Tejashwi Prasad Yadav said on Tuesday evening that he will soon meet the ailing senior RJD leader once the latter recovers.“Raghuvansh ji is our guardian and nursed the RJD. He is very much in the party. I will soon meet him,” he said||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/miffed-senior-rjd-leader-raghuvansh-prasad-singh-decides-to-step-down-from-party-post/story-h8i8TAePZjIYAF6OW80jXI.html

He alleged that there appears to be “sinister moves” to push profit-making ventures into loss-making liabilities and “force non-J&K people and organisations” over the ventures on the name of revival and redevelopment.“The case of Jammu and Kashmir Cements Limited (JKCL), a profit-making venture of the state government, is an example of abject mismanagement, lack of vision and apathetic attitude of the government. Because of this, the PSU has gone down the hill. For the past 16 months, the employees have not been paid. How difficult it must be for the families to live can be anybody’s guess,” it said.The body said that after Article 370 was abrogated, it was decided by the Centre that the industries will be set up and the locals will get the preference. “But, on the ground, the situation does not seem to be anywhere near. No industrial policy had been yet framed for J&K. And whatever industrial infrastructure is existing currently, even that is being destroyed. It seems that a situation is being created to show that only outsiders can help revive and rejuvenate things here. This is not true. The government had promised employment generation, but if the existing industries are choked, how can the youth in J&K get the jobs?” the body said.“While abrogating Article 370 last year, Prime Minister and home minister promised the nation and to the people of J&K that they would ensure the rights of the people and land, jobs would be protected at all cost. Let us win the hearts rather than betray,” it said.The body said that if the government was willing it can save the JKCL plant which is an asset to the UT economy and turn it into a profit-making venture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kashmiri-pandit-migrants-body-alleges-sinister-moves-to-thrust-outsiders-on-j-k-s-industrial-ventures/story-iXWxeSbekN42v29ccjnAxO.html

In Shalkar, Jio had erected a mobile relay tower but left the work halfway after the lockdown was enforced. Other mobile service providers are yet to start erecting their towers.“Government talks high of digital India, but our plight is still worse. The country has reached the moon, but we are still lacking internet connectivity in the region,” said Puran Chand, head of Kunnu Charnag panchayat.“We were already reeling under Covid-19, and now due to India-China standoff, things are tense at Kinnaur border. Children in border villages are unable to attend their online classes and complete their home work and assignments in the absence of internet connection,” says Hishey Negi of district disaster management authority.Apart from this, due to low subscription rate and high spectrum cost, not many private cellular companies are keen on expanding their network in the region. Therefore, the government has urged BSNL to increase its mobile towers in the district.The army has also been pressing for upgrading the communication network, particularly in Shalkar and Chango villages, located close to the China border.Several army garrisons are located in remote and tribal areas of the district, and due to heavy snowfall, electricity supply often gets disrupted. As a result, they have to rely on diesel-run generators to meet their electricity needs and operate the communication systems.When contacted, Kinnaur deputy commissioner Gopal Chand said the Indo-Tibetan Border Police and Indian Army are manning the border areas of the district. “The district administration is in constant touch with the military authorities and ensuring that there is no dearth of essential commodities in the border villages,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amid-border-tensions-hp-villages-close-to-china-grappling-with-poor-phone-connectivity/story-XB3GmvSL2ZfDhmIMKOu37K.html

The state’s current growth rate is 7% and it will require raising it substantially for which a significant increase in the investment rate will be needed, besides improvement in basic infrastructure, the RFP document says.The consultant will have to do critical analysis of macro and micro economic sectoral data around GSDP, trade, investment, expenditure, saving, workforce participation, inflation, import and export between the four fiscals -- 2016 to 2020. The consultant will also have to compare the structural, institutional, financial and governance reforms carried out and outcomes achieved in top the three states of the country and top three countries across the world, with similarities to UP. Then it will have to develop a strategic framework for achieving the target, create implementation roadmap and design institutional reforms, also.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/up-sets-out-to-hire-consultant-to-achieve-1-trillion-economy/story-39twTn6ha3EEz3O6CgplxI.html

Kangra superintendent of police (SP) Vimukt Ranjan said a case was registered under Sections 403 (dishonest misappropriation of property), 406 (criminal breach of trust) and 34 (act done in furtherance of common intention) on a complaint filed by assistant registrar of co-operative society Pratyush Chauhan on June 21.

In a ponzi scam, fraudsters lure people to invest small amounts of money in schemes, offering alluring rate of return. Such schemes usually target gullible investors and in this specific scheme, investors were promised 19% interest rate. The scam was run under the name of Sarv Manglam Cooperative Society Non-Trading Company, which is registered in Dharamshala. The investors filed complaints against the company management after they stopped getting returns around 10 months ago. The accused made lame excuses to repay the money and closed the social media accounts. Meanwhile, the registrar cooperative society has seized bank accounts of the company and a complete audit is being done.

23-06-2020||Lucknow||We should have won gold at Jakarta: Vandana Katariya||With over 200 international goals, Indian women’s hockey forward Vandana Katariya’s hunger for success is well-known. Gold medalist at the 2017 Asia Cup and a silver and bronze medalist at the Asian Games, a former inmate of the Girls Hockey Hostel in Lucknow Vandana has been recommended for the Arjuna award by Hockey India though, she still rues the missed chances, which could have fetched India its maiden gold, at the Jakarta Asian Games in 2018. She spoke about her success journey with the Indian team so far.Excerpts:How did you feel after your hit was thwarted twice by the Japanese goalkeeper in the Jakarta Asian Games final, which India lost?It was tough to digest. We should have won gold and qualified for the Tokyo Olympics directly. I had sleepless nights because of the chances I missed, but the senior players, Rani and Savita, told me that this happens in sport and it wasn’t entirely my fault as everything depends on how the team is playing. However, it was great to qualify for the Olympics after defeating USA in the FIH Olympic Qualifiers. Clinching an Olympic berth in front of the home crowd was magical.What did you do to keep yourself mentally strong during the lockdown at Bengaluru?I think maintaining our fitness level has played a huge role in helping us stay mentally strong during this period. Our scientific advisor Wayne Lombard has devised some fitness schedules, which have been a blessing during this tough time. We were fortunate to be staying at the Sports Authority of India campus. We are a very positive unit and all the players and coaches have kept the spirits up among the group.Was it difficult to stay calm when there were no activities and players were apprehensive about COVID 19?We have carried out a host of activities during this period. It was great to have some time to focus on our hobbies such as reading and drawing. We watched footage of matches as well to get a sense of the techniques we need to improve on. Luckily, we found ways to keep ourselves busy and that helped to deal with the apprehension of the situation. I enjoyed the Hockey India Level ‘Basic’ Coaching Course online. It was fantastic to know about the history of the game and go through the rules of hockey.The Indian women’s team has been doing well, but don’t you feel the team needs to play more attacking hockey?I think we have improved our attacking game after chief coach Sjoerd Marijne has joined us. He has focused on improving our fitness levels and ensured we attack aggressively. However, being a good defensive side is equally important. If our defense is rock-solid then we have a chance to be more attacking and subsequently create more scoring opportunities. We have to work hard to maintain a balance in the side which helps the evolvement of the entire team.You have been named for the Arjuna award…It is fantastic to be nominated for the Arjuna Award. It’s a huge honour for me. I have been able to perform consistently only because of my teammates. They have always been there for me through ups and downs. How were your days at the Lucknow hockey hostel?I used to play hockey at the Roshnabad stadium in Haridwar before moving to the hostel in Lucknow. Unfortunately, we didn’t have a lot of facilities for hockey in Roshnabad at that time so it was great to start practicing in Lucknow where the facilities were much better. However, we still practiced on grass pitches in Lucknow, so it was a bit difficult to get used to the Astroturf, once I started moving up the ranks. But now we carry out most of our practice during national camps, so it’s great for me. I value my time in the Lucknow hostel. I honed my skills there and I have been able to achieve great heights only because of practicing there.Your take on the improving hockey standard in UP?Hockey has grown in Uttar Pradesh since the time I joined the Indian team. Many young girls from my village and nearby places like Aurangabad have started playing the sport. I have noticed that a majority of the players who have taken up hockey in that area are girls. Hockey has been one of the popular sports in UP as one of the greatest players in the history of the game, Major Dhyan Chand, is from our state. I am sure the game will grow even more in UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/we-should-have-won-gold-at-jakarta-vandana-katariya/story-GLrRJ46aB818AkQx3ibxWO.html

We have prayed before the court that the transfer application is not maintainable and requested the court to dismiss the same,” Dhanoa said.The application for transfer of case was filed after ADJ Monika Goyal’s court allowed interim bail to Saini in anticipation of the SIT adding Section 302 of the IPC to the earlier FIR.Multani was allegedly picked up by two officers in 1991 after a terrorist attack on Saini, the then Chandigarh SSP, in which four policemen in his security posse were killed.

23-06-2020||Kolkata||Bengal private bus operators demand fare hike due to diesel price hike, Covid restrictions||Private bus operators of West Bengal on Tuesday demanded immediate hike in fares owing to mounting diesel cost and Covid-19 related restrictions on the number of passengers that each bus can carry.Joint Council of Bus Syndicate’s General Secretary Tapan Banerjee said that the passenger transport business in West Bengal is facing a “natural death” owing to the situation where revenue from tickets sales is far lower than daily fuel cost.“In addition to this, there are other expenses like staff salary, insurance, road tax and bank EMI,” Banerjee said.He said that the state governments stipulation that only seating capacity passengers can be allowed to board a bus has led to a huge reduction in income.Now, the rising fuel prices are a further blow to the already ailing passenger transport business, Banerjee said.“In the present situation, bus fares need to be increased immediately. Otherwise, operators of private buses, who provide the bulk of passenger transportation facilities in the state, will have no choice but to take their vehicles off the roads,” he said.State transport undertakings the West Bengal Transport Corporation (WBTC), North Bengal State Transport Corporation and the South Bengal State Transport Corporation - are also suffering because of a huge gap in daily income from ticket sales and expenditure, an official said.The WBTC is, at present, plying buses in 135 routes in the city and the suburbs, the official said.Various private bus operators’ associations in West Bengal last week met an expert committee set up by the state government to discuss demands made by them, including a fare hike, for the survival of the private passenger transport business.The operators told the committee that running private buses with only seating capacity passengers as mandated by the government for maintaining social distancing norms, and rising fuel costs are causing operating losses for the owners, General Secretary of the All Bengal Bus Minibus Samannoy Samity, Rahul Chatterjee, said.The associations also asked for waiver of road tax during the lockdown period when no income was generated, saying it is difficult for the owners to pay it.Chatterjee said they have other expenses to meet such as bank EMI and vehicle insurance.The expert committee, which was set up on June 5, has been asked to submit its report to the government within a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/bengal-private-bus-operators-demand-fare-hike-due-to-diesel-price-hike-covid-restrictions/story-hiBKjwtI3oxgtm8hngYinO.html

It was informed that the project with an estimated cost of ₹50 crore under Pilgrimage Rejuvenation and Spiritual Augmentation Drive (PRASAD) has been submitted to the Centre for approval and funding.Murmu said that the UT administration is laying a special focus on the development of the places of spiritual and religious importance and called for synergised efforts by all stakeholders in this direction.Amid the prevailing situation due to Covid-19 pandemic, the religious places have been closed down for the devotees, but soon after the situation gets normal, the government will expedite the development process of religious places, he added.He said that the development of religious places like Purmandal and Utterbehni will attract more tourists which will ultimately give a fillip to the economy of the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/l-g-conducts-whirlwind-tour-of-purmandal-utterbehni-area-in-j-k-s-samba-district/story-gOih89rICFonVHAfRQWBfK.html

23-06-2020||Pune||77 unauthorised constructions identified as one of the reasons for Pune flash floods 2019 still stand||One hundred mm of rain in two hours in September 2019 set the Ambil Odha up to burst its banks and overflow. In a detailed post-mortem of the scenario in the aftermath of the devastating flash floods that killed 26 and destroyed property along the banks of the stream, it was found that illegal encroachments and unauthorised structures on, and along the stream, were a key factor in causing the flash floods.Nine months later, the monsoon has arrived in the city, on schedule, and most unauthorised structures are still standing. The situation, according to activists and local residents, is a perfect mix for inviting “havoc” again.After the floods, which caused a loss of Rs 400 crore, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) appointed a private firm, Pri-Move, to survey the stream. The firm identified 77 structures alongside the Ambil Odha which aggravated the floods. A separate committee of environmental activists and residents then prepared a report pointing to specific unauthorised constructions that contributed to the floods.Based on the Pri-Move report, the PMC served notices to all 77 unauthorised structures and razed 12 of them.“We had served notices to the 77 unauthorised structures which surfaced in the report and 12 such structures have been demolished so far. Action has been taken based on the recommendations made in the report,” said PMC’s engineering superintendent Rajendra Raut.Civic activists, however, questioned the PMC figure of 77 unauthorised structures along the Ambil Odha.“This is definitely not an honest assessment as 77 is too low a number. The illegal tenements are linked to a deeper nexus, which makes effective action difficult,” said RTI activist Vijay Kumbhar.Besides the PMC’s survey, a group of environmental activists independently surveyed a four-kilometre stretch, starting from Katraj lake till Sahakarnagar. The group, known as ‘Bhavtal’, found that illegal encroachments along with garbage had choked drains that created a hindrance to the flow of water during the floods.“Most illegal structures have been there for years and some of them were found to be the main obstacles to free flowing water,” said Abhijit Ghorpade, founder of Bhavtal, “Things cannot improve unless effective steps are taken for encroachment removal from the nallah beds by the PMC.”Stream width the hurdleThe Pune development plan (DP) of 1987 states that the width of Ambil Odha is 18 metres and permission for construction was granted accordingly.During its survey, Pri-Move considered the width of the stream as 20 metres, and used it as a baseline to calculate which structures were unauthorised.“In 2020, the width used in the survey became a legal issue with the PMC finding it difficult to take action against illegal structures due to political pressure,” said a PMC official, requesting anonymity.Civic chief Shekhar Gaikwad disagreed. “It’s not that PMC is not acting against unauthorised structures and illegal encroachments. We have already initiated the action before the monsoon; though because of the Covid pandemic now the focus has shifted. We plan to resume action once the Covid tide subsides,” said Gaikwad.Ground realityLocal corporators are squarely blaming the civic body for the inaction, citing “corruption”.The NCP’s Ashwini Kadam, corporator of Dhankawdi- Sahakarnagar, said, “It is the rampant corruption in PMC which has caused rolling back of tenders and inaction for the past one year against such structures. The monsoon has already set in and there is every possibility of flooding in the area.”Residents of areas affected by the 2019 flash floods agree. Shantanu Khilare, a resident of Gururaj Society in Sahakarnagar said, “These structures blocked the flow of water which led to the flooding of our residential societies. The PMC sat idle for an entire year and now the officials are saying that they are facing the Covid crisis.”Dhananjay Gaikwad, a resident of the Dandekar bridge area claimed that the PMC cannot evict residents from the tenements as they had voter IDs and paid taxes. “Any action by the PMC against the slums will destroy their homes and livelihoods and lead to a humanitarian crisis,” Gaikwad said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/77-unauthorised-constructions-identified-as-one-of-the-reasons-for-pune-flash-floods-2019-still-stand/story-tSQR4yOhSBtZUGywbhzBfI.html

23-06-2020||Delhi||Employees cannot seek enforcement of ‘normal’ employment terms: Delhi HC||The Delhi High Court has dismissed a petition claiming that the Air Force Civil Cooks are being forced to stay away from their homes for 28 days in a month observing that employees cannot seek the enforcement of “normal” employment terms amid the ongoing coronavirus pandemic.A division bench of Justice Rajiv Sahay Endlaw and Justice Asha Menon said that it appears that the petition has been filed without regard to the prevalent circumstances and the large-scale loss of employment and hardships being faced by those without assurance of employment.“The members of the petitioner though having a surety of employment are making grievances of inconveniences allegedly being suffered by them, again forgetting that the members of the petitioner, as cooks, if permitted to return to their respective residences after duty hours every day, are likely to bring with them the Covid-19 infection, when reporting back for duty, endangering the personnel of the Air Force,” the bench said in its order on Monday.“They cannot thus seek enforcement of employment terms as in the normal time when the entire country is going through abnormal times,” the bench said while dismissing the plea.The court was hearing a plea, filed by All India Association of Air Force Civil Cooks, claiming that the cooks are being made to reside at the Air Force Stations of their posting and a roster of 14+14+7 is being followed.“For the first 14 days they are kept in quarantine; for the next 14 days they are made to work as cooks and thereafter they are given seven days at home in which they visit their respective residences and thereafter again report to work,” the plea had submitted.It contended that it is not the term of their employment that they will be made to so stay away from their respective families and added that they are not being treated as ‘Corona Warriors’ and being thus not conferred benefits to which ‘Corona Warriors’ are entitled.The plea sought directions to allow the employees to be quarantined for 14 days at their respective residences.The court, however, observed that petition seeking to permit the members of the petitioner to home quarantine is again without application of mind as to how many members of the family are there, what kind of residential accommodation is available and whether home quarantine is even possible for each of the members.The suggestion made during the hearing, of the members of the petitioner being made to work in the kitchens wearing Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) is again totally illogical and without knowledge of conditions in the kitchen and the viability of using PPE, the court held.“We are also unable to see as to how the civilian cooks of the Air Force who are during the hearing described as Group ‘C’ non-industrial employees of Air Force, are entitled to be treated as ‘Corona Warriors’ and entitled to benefits thereof,” the order said.It said that while working in the kitchen at the Air Force Stations, the members of the petitioner cannot be said to be exposed in any manner to the coronavirus to claim themselves to be “frontline workers”.Meanwhile, the court also enquired from the counsel for the Centre, why the members of the petitioners cannot be made to reside at the respective stations for a longer period to reduce the time spent in quarantine.It also asked the counsel for the respondents whether a better arrangement can be worked out or the charges for the meals be dispensed on the petitioner’s grievance that they, while being made to reside at the stations, are charged for their meals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/employees-cannot-seek-enforcement-of-normal-employment-terms-delhi-hc/story-uqNUXnwqI2hhvQVcMJPxHK.html

The raids are aimed at collecting evidence in the case, they said.The agency in March had filed two cases to investigate the alleged funding of the Delhi riots - one against Hussain and another against Popular Front of India (PFI).Hussain, who is facing charges of killing an Intelligence Bureau official, has been booked under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).Hussain, who was an AAP corporator from ward number 59 under the Mustafabad assembly seat in Delhi, was booked by the police in the murder case of Intelligence Bureau (IB) staffer Ankit Sharma in North-East Delhi amid the violence over the new citizenship law that degenerated into a communal riot.He was arrested in March after an FIR was filed against him by Sharma’s family. The ED is probing Hussain’s alleged links with PFI.The Delhi Police’s crime branch had earlier this month filed charge sheets in connection with riots in North-East district of the city stating that Hussain had led the mob that killed IB staffer Ankit Sharma on February 25.One of the charge sheets alleges a “deep rooted conspiracy” behind Sharma’s murder in which 10 people have been arrested so far.Ankit Sharma, an intelligence bureau staffer, was killed by a mob during riots that broke out in north east Delhi on February 25 this year, when groups supporting and opposing the Citizens Amendment Act and the National Register of Citizens clashed with each other for close to three days leading to at least 53 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ed-raids-premises-of-aap-s-tahir-hussain-and-several-places-in-city-in-connection-with-delhi-riots/story-wDBkht7pz2pqRAU4lG19BL.html

23-06-2020||Chandigarh||Patients left in a lurch in Ludhiana as doctors protest against Clinical Establishments Act||Doctors in Ludhiana observed a complete medical bandh on Tuesday to oppose the implementation of the Clinical Establishments Act (CEA) in Punjab.Senior vice-president of the Ludhiana branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr Gaurav Sachdeva said all private hospitals and diagnostic centres, except Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC&H), Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H) and Civil Hospital Ludhiana, had been closed to oppose the ‘draconian law’.IMA (Ludhiana) president Dr Sunil Katyal said the new act, which will be implemented on July 1, was uncalled for and wrongly timed.He said doctors were already governed by the Punjab Medical Council (PMC) and National Medical Council (NMC/MCI) and hospital buildings were governed by building regulations. Many hospitals are also getting accredited by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare Providers (NABH). “The introduction of this act will achieve nothing except the harassment of doctors,” Katyal added. IMA Ludhiana honorary secretary Dr Dheeraj Aggarwal said the act was against people, patients, the poor and doctors.“It will lead to an increase in hospital charges and treatment costs. Private health care delivery in Punjab is already of a high quality as over 70% of the patients seek treatment from private setups than from government hospitals,” Aggarwal said. Punjab State governing Council joint action committee co-chairperson Dr Manoj K Sobti said, “The act will encourage inspector raj. The states where it has been implemented do not show any improvement in health care delivery.”“We had informed the authorities about the medical bandh on June 23. If the government does not address our issues, we will hold a meeting on June 28 to discuss further course of action,” said Dr Sobti.PATIENTS AT RECEIVING ENDThe strike inconvenienced several patients. Hajuria, a migrant labourer of Tibba Road, who was visiting Arora Neuro Centre on Mall Road with her seven-year-old son to collect a CT scan report was asked to return.“We have travelled almost 10km on foot to collect my son’s CT report but I have been told to return home as the hospital is closed. My son is suffering from a liver disease and is in great pain. I need the report urgently so that the further treatment can be determined,” Hajuria said.One Chander Kishore, who had come to the hospital from Jamalpur, said, “I had an appointment but on reaching here, I was told that the hospital was closed. All major hospitals are full of Covid-19 patients while the smaller hospitals are on strike. Where should a patient go?” 67-year-old Harish Kumar also faced a similar predicament. “I came to Deep Hospital in Model Town for treatment of my prostate. I was to be diagnosed today but on reaching here I was told to return on Wednesday.”WHAT IS THE CLINICAL ESTABLISHMENTS ACT?The notification under sub-section three of Section 1 of the Punjab Clinical Establishments (Registration & Regulation) Ordinance, 2020, brings all clinical establishments with a capacity of at least 50 beds under the provisions of the ordinance.This is in line with the decision taken by the council of ministers during its April 10 meeting.As per the official statement, “The ordinance will provide a mechanism for registration and regulation of clinical establishments in a professional manner, to ensure compliance of minimum standards of facilities and services, as well as transparency in the functioning of these establishments for fair and proper delivery of health services to the common man.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/patients-left-in-a-lurch-in-ludhiana-as-doctors-protest-against-clinical-establishment-act/story-fNfmt1PQwZXRHcSMdKiJOO.html
23-06-2020||Chandigarh||Patients left in the lurch as pvt hospitals remain shut in state||JALANDHAR/LUDHIANA/PATIALAPatients were at the receiving end as private hospitals and clinics remained closed across Punjab on Tuesday in protest against the Punjab Clinical Establishment (Registration and Regulation) Ordinance, 2020, that is coming into force from July 1. Terming the ordinance “anti-doctor” and “anti-public”, the protesters, under the banner of the Punjab chapter of the Indian Medical Association, said the government was trying to control the private healthcare sector.The Punjab cabinet had last month notified the ordinance, which would be applicable to clinical establishments having more than 50 beds. The ordinance provides registration and regulation of clinical establishments in a professional manner to ensure compliance of clinical standards and protocols and transparency in the functioning of these establishments for fair and proper delivery of health services to the common man.IMA president Dr Navjot Singh Dahyia said: “Around 10,000 doctors affiliated with the association are unhappy over two recent decisions of the state government - the PCE ordinance and the hike in MBBS fee.”“We want both decisions revoked and had issued an ultimatum to the government two weeks ago. A memorandum was also submitted to the administration and MLAs. However, the government failed to address our demands,” said Dr Rakesh Vig, convener of the IMA action committee.The agitating doctors said there was no need for this law as they were already regulated by the Punjab Medical Council and other laws.The government doctors could not join the protest owing to the Epidemic Act, but they expressed solidarity with their fellow doctors by donating blood at some places, including the Jalandhar civil hospital in Jalandhar.Senior vice-president of Ludhiana branch of the IMA Dr Gaurav Sachdeva said all private hospitals, diagnostic centres, except Christian Medical College and Hospital (CMC&H), Dayanand Medical College and Hospital (DMC&H) and Ludhiana civil hospital, remained closed. BOXXCM TO MEET IMA DELEGATION ON FRIDAYChief minister Capt Amarinder Singh will listen to the grievances of the IMA on Friday.“The CM will interact with our delegation through video-conference on Friday. We would request the CM to withdraw the Clinical Establishment Ordinance, which would only promote inspector raj,” said state president of IMA’s Punjab chapter, Dr Navjot Dahiya.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/private-hospitals-suspend-services-in-protest-of-punjab-clinical-establishment-ordinance/story-hgsQdNh6eV1Ol8ws0RWyuN.html

23-06-2020||Patna||RJD in turmoil, Grand Alliance in disarray ahead of legislative council polls||Lalu Prasad’s Rashtriya Janata Dal appeared to be in turmoil on Monday when a large number of disgruntled party leaders created a ruckus in front of the residence of his wife Rabri Devi, demanding ticket for legislative council elections in Bihar for a veteran leader.Biennial elections to the Upper House, for nine seats falling under the Vidhan Sabha constituency, are underway and the RJD has announced that it will be fielding three candidates whose names would be made public upon approval from Prasad who is currently in Ranchi, serving sentences in fodder scam cases.Speculations are rife that the party may give one ticket each to the upper castes, non-Yadav OBCs and the minorities in a bid to project an inclusive image ahead of the assembly elections due in a few months.However, hundreds of angry supporters from Raghopur the assembly segment formerly represented by Prasad and now by his heir apparent Tejashwi Yadav staged a demonstration in front of 10, Circular Road, the government bungalow allotted to Rabri Devi in her capacity as a former Chief Minister.The party workers were demanding that the RJD fulfil its “promise” of a Vidhan Parishad berth to Uday Narain Rai alias Bhola babu who had represented Raghopur several times in the 1970s and 1980s and given up his claim on the seat in the 2015 assembly polls to enable Tejashwi Yadav make his debut at the young age of 25.They got livid upon being told that Rabri Devi and Tejashwi Yadav, who lives at her mothers place, were ready to hold talks with a delegation comprising “not more than 15 people”.Terming the gesture as an “insult” the RJD workers left but told journalists present at the spot that they would have to reconsider their ties with the party and that “Tejashwi Yadav may have to pay the price in assembly polls”.Filing of nomination papers for the election will come to a close on June 25 and neither the opposition camp led by the RJD, nor the ruling NDA have revealed the names of their candidates.The election is scheduled for July 6.However, a broad understanding seems to have been arrived at in the NDA that Chief Minister Nitish Kumars JD(U) will field three candidates, and the BJP will contest two seats.In the five-party Grand Alliance headed by the RJD, the Congress is also expected to get one seat.However, developments are taking place which may queer the pitch for the opposition camp.Sulking Grand Alliance partner Jitan Ram Manjhi, who is the founding president of Hindustani Awam Morcha, held a meeting of his party at his residence amid speculations that he was planning a return to the NDA.A former JD(U) leader who fell apart with Nitish Kumar when made to step down as Chief Minister to make way for his patron, Manjhi fought the 2015 assembly polls as an NDA constituent, winning only one of the two seats he contested while all candidates of his party lost.He crossed over to the Grand Alliance in March, 2018 apparently discomfited by Kumars return to the NDA. Although the RJD rewarded him with a legislative council berth for his son Santosh Manjhi from its own quota, the septuagenarian enjoys a less than cordial relationship with Tejashwi Yadav.Bihar minister and JD(U) leader Ashok Choudhary said, “Nitish Kumar is a dependable leader and it should surprise nobody if people join us in the run up to assembly elections.If Manjhi returns, it will be homecoming for him though a final decision is to be taken by our national president”.Earlier in the day, Manjhi had dropped ample hints that his aversion to Nitish Kumar was passe, saying “nobody is a permanent friend or foe in politics”.He is, however, said to be hesitant over the condition put up by the JD(U) for his return that he merge HAM with the parent outfit.“I hope things will be sorted out in the Grand Alliance till June 25. If not, our party will meet on June 26 and I will follow whatever decision it takes”, Manjhi said cryptically.Meanwhile, the RLSP headed by former Union minister Upendra Kushwaha, raised alarm over the happenings in the Grand Alliance.“All is not well in the Grand Alliance. We must act before it is too late. Candidates for the legislative council must be announced while taking care that promises made by parties to each other were fulfilled”, RLSP national general secretary Madhaw Anand said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/rjd-in-turmoil-grand-alliance-in-disarray-ahead-of-legislative-council-polls/story-EHUbjZp2WH6mQJM5HKqe4J.html

23-06-2020||Chandigarh||Land compensation for road: Panel indicts minister Sodhi’s family for pocketing double compensation||A sub-committee constituted by Punjab government indicted the cabinet minister Rana Gurmit Singh Sodhi’s family for pocketing double compensation against a piece of land acquired by the state government for a road project. The family received ₹1.83 crore compensation in 2013 for the land after re-acquisition in 2012, which, as per records, was also acquired in 1962 and a sum of ₹7,384 paid. The said land at Mohanki Attar village had been acquired for the Ferozepur-Fazilka-Gurharsahai road.The land — 55 kanal and 6 marla of Rana Sodhi and 38 kanal of his nephew Jasdeep Sodhi (son of Hardeep Singh) — was re-acquired by the Punjab government and compensation was paid after the owners approached the court.The panel has recommended probe into the role of public works department (PWD) and revenue department officials to fix responsibility as the “whole matter smells of willful connivance with the beneficiaries”.“The land at Mohanki Attar was acquired twice, in 1962 and then in 2011-12, as the record were not updated,” says the report.The Milestones 2005 Rana Gurmit Singh files a suit in the court of civil judge (senior division), Ferozepur, demanding acquisition and compensation for the land. The suit was decided in his favour in April 2006. 2006 Department files appeal against the orders, which was dismissed in October 2007.2008 Guru Gurmit Singh, his nephews Prabhjot Singh and Jasdeep Singh through their special power of attorney Hardeep Singh make a representation with the government seeking compensation.2011 Punjab government issues acquisition notification; compensation awarded in 2012.2014 Family receives ₹1.83-crore compensation.As per the report, Hardeep Singh had given four representations to government as Special Power of Attorney (of his brother Rana Sodhi and three sons) in the year 2008 that the land on which road had been constructed was neither acquired nor compensation paid to them.The committee found that Hardeep Singh was in the know that the land was acquired in 1962 and he himself had admitted in his two letters to the public works department in 1963 that they had received the compensation. “…then how could he give a representations...this means that he held back the facts while giving representations,” points out the report.The report puts a questionmark on the role PWD and revenue officials. “Intentional negligence reflects on every aspect and the case has been grossly mishandled since beginning,” it says.“As far as beneficiaries are concerned, it has been established that at least Hardeep Singh was in the knowledge of all the facts regarding acquisition of land in 1962 since he himself had handled that acquisition on behalf of the family,” the report says.“Therefore, legal remedy should be sought from the court of competent jurisdiction to annul the subsequent acquisition proceedings,” concludes the report.In March this year, Punjab government formed a five-member sub-committee comprising special secretary, PWD; director consolidation-cum-director land records; land acquisition officer PWD (B&R), Jalandhar; district revenue officer, Ferozepur, and executive engineer, construction Division-1, PWD (B&R), Ferozepur, to examine the records.When reached over the phone, Hardeep Singh said, “We have neither any information about any sub-committee formed by the government nor aware of its findings. We were not even called by the committee. If they have facts then they should produce in the court as it is legal matter now.” He categorically denied having received any compensation in 1962 from the state.Cabinet minister Rana Sodhi didn’t respond to the calls and messages. Principal secretary, PWD, Vikas Pratap, too was incommunicado.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/land-compensation-for-road-panel-indicts-minister-sodhi-s-family-for-pocketing-double-compensation/story-1SMMSyz7N8aGgmsI1gYmyJ.html

Since the coronavirus scare has forced many to work from home, even after the lockdown, many are feeling trapped indoors sans the free AC of office and chilled drinks from the cafeteria. From whipping up frappés to wearing comfy clothes and even switching rooms to find cooler spots, they are doing it all! Recently, reports of maximum temperature breaching the 46 degree celsius mark, in some areas of Delhi, came in from the India Meteorological Department (IMD). For Manohar Venugopal, who works in Gurugram, it was all about changing into a comfortable ganji and shorts, and beating the heat in style. “The AC environment is certainly a miss but this can be beaten by working smartly and efficiently. Having said this, must admit that the afternoon hours are just unbearable! I ensure to find the coolest corner of the house to work, and also consume cooling foods that help such as salads and lemonade. The saving grace is to not to be asked to commute to office or be out in the heat, and having the flexibility to work in comfy casuals!”Badly missing the office AC, a tech executive, Vibhesh Kapoor, says, “I really miss the free office AC. Making do with a cooler at home for now. My AC required servicing and the guys were charging a bomb. Now, I barely get to switch it on during the night, usmein bhi light chali jaaye toh woh alag. Keeping cool by having khus sharbat.” And Mohit Chauhan, a banker, adds, “On one hand we have been saved from the scorching sun, especially those who have a sales or field-job profile like me, on the other hand we are missing the comfort that office air conditioning renders. Not everyone has aircons at home and thus looked forward to spending a few non-sweaty hours within the plush and comfortable office premises.”   45 degrees ☀️🔥☄️ . . . . . #ipadpro #summer #delhi #dillikigarmi #art #arte #artist #artwork #illustrationart #illustration #illustrationgram #dr#drowsy #drawing #littlestupid #fan #drawdaily #girl #india #instadraw #instagram #instalike #likesforlikes #likesforfollow #buzzfeed #buzzfeedindiaA post shared by  Rashi (@little_stupid) on May 14, 2017 at 1:36am PDTSwitching between one cool place in the house to another, Supriya Maulick, a city-based lawyer, says, “I was working at the dining table till the weather permitted, but finally moved into the bedroom when the heat got unbearable, since I don’t have an AC in the dining room.

23-06-2020||Delhi||Mango Festival 2020: Log onto social media to get a slice of the king of fruits||Mango – name it and the king of fruits brings memories of one of the most-loved festivals of Delhi, that is, Mango Festival. For those who have been to this annual affair, at Dilli Haat INA or Janak Puri, know that for more than three decades it has been a crowd-puller. But this time around, due to Covid-19 pandemic, the organisers have decided to take the fun-filled celebrations online. “While people will miss the thrill and sheer joy of the mango eating competition, ‘Sau hai daam, jitne khao aam’, we have decided to prioritise the safety of the visitors and mango growers; who have brought hundreds of varieties from across the nation,” says Manoj Kumar, manager, PR & Publicity, Delhi Tourism, adding that the festival is “going virtual” in its 32nd edition. It was a common sight to see almost 500 varieties of mangoes at this event every year. Devyn Kumar, a budding chef, says, “Sharing mangoes at the dinner table has been a vivid part of my childhood nostalgia. The event has been something we shared as a family for the last six years. My father was looking forward to the festival this time, and the quirky names that sellers give to their mangoes. But we’ll make do with the virtual event.”  So those of you who want to stay safe indoors and yet relish the vast variety of mangoes, check out the social media handles of Delhi Tourism. Manoj Kumar adds, “The mango eating contest has been a staple favourite for years. This year, people can cherish mangoes from the safety of their homes via our social media handles from June 24 to July 15. We have plans to share trivia on different varieties of mangoes with our social media users. Alongside, mango lovers can also indulge in fun contests and recipes that we will run online.” Mango lovers, who would earlier make a beeline for the cultural event, are tad disappointed with the festival going virtual. Take for instance a Noida-based student Purnima Verma, who loved participating in the various contests at the festival. “I come from a family of mango lovers! I remember memorising trivia for the contest where my friends and I would participate and try to outdo each other. We used to make a day out of it, taste as many varieties of mangoes as we could gorge on. It’s sad that the event has been called off this year. However, in the current scenario it is only logical to avoid crowded gatherings,” says Verma.So until next year, keep an eye for mangoes such as Modi aam or Virat aam, which had not just unique names – in the previous years of the festival – but even delicious taste to leave you wanting for more!

Gurukul Housing Society can utilise two more flats to quarantine residents if needed, its members said. The isolation centre was inaugurated by local parliamentarian Gopal Shetty on Monday.The office-bearers of Gurukul Housing Society had come up with the idea after many members, including doctors, started stepping out for work after ‘Mission Begin Again’ was announced. Though the society has not seen any case until now, they have decided to utilise the empty flat as an isolation centre with three beds, which can be extended to five beds if needed. Society secretary Rashmin Parikh said, “Some of us had visited a society in Kandivli [which has set up an isolation centre on its premises] to understand what precautions need to be followed and the standard operating procedure. We then converted one of the three empty flats into an isolation centre.”Manish Vora, one of the residents of Gurukul Housing Society, said, “Our society consists of around 200 members. Though there are no coronavirus cases among residents, we decided to take the step as a precautionary measure as a considerable number of members have resumed work. So any member showing Covid-19 symptoms can be isolated in the rescue flat for 14 days.”Last week, the civic body had decided to permit housing societies and complexes to set up isolation facilities in gyms and club houses inside their premises to quarantine Covid-19 residents who are either asymptomatic or showed mild symptoms. The civic authority had then stated that this move, in addition to helping authorities, will also give a homely feeling to the residents who are quarantined.“It is better to take precautions, especially because of the monsoon along with the outbreak. As of now, eight societies in my constituency have opened such centres on their premises,” said Shetty. HT had earlier reported that this society, which comprises of 190 flats in three wings, had removed chairs from the sitting area and increased security personnel during the lockdown in a bid to prevent a possibility of transmission in the society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/housing-society-in-mumbai-converts-flat-into-covid-19-isolation-centre/story-YKS1OnNbHmROOyYt8yOGtM.html

The report has stated that while the Centre had directed states to utilise ₹3,100 crore under the Building and Construction Workers Welfare Fund to support construction workers who have been left without any income owing to the lockdown, only 5.29% of those surveyed in 1,237 households had been registered with the Building and Other Construction Workers’ (BoCW) Welfare Board. It also stated that 94% of the workers surveyed found themselves unable to avail the benefits of this scheme.The state had also announced a payment of ₹2,000 to workers registered with BoCW through direct transfer in April. State labour commissioner Mahendra Kalyankar, however, said till date the state has disbursed ₹175 crore by depositing ₹2,000 in the accounts of construction workers. “We have also run many campaigns to get workers registered,” Kalyankar said. S Srirangam, chief executive officer of the state BoCW, said till June 12, more than 8 lakh workers have benefitted from the scheme.Pankaj Kumar, state development commissioner (unorganised sector), said, “As per the government’s directions, we had surveyed around 2 lakh migrant workers who were housed in relief camps across the state. We have also given 1.15 lakh workers temporary registration numbers. Once they are back from their villages, they will be registered with BoCW to avail benefits.” The report stated that in the 3,873 households surveyed, only 32.27% members had bank accounts in the names of women to avail the direct cash transfers announced by the Centre for women (as well as senior citizens, the disabled and widows) in March. The report further stated that although the Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana, which provides free cylinders to women, had been expanded in March as a relief measure during the lockdown, merely 6.36% of the 3,646 houses surveyed had availed of the scheme.In the six municipal corporations, only 1.13% of the more than 3,000 households surveyed have members who have been registered with the National Urban Livelihoods Mission (NULM).Pointing at the apparent limited outreach of these schemes, Yuva has also provided mid-term and long-term recommendations. Some of these include provision of emergency ration cards to help workers secure food and fast-track registration of construction and domestic workers to enable direct transfers. Marina Joseph from Yuva said, “No society, despite the best of funding or outreach can help all citizens. However, the state’s relief measures have to be strengthened. Despite introducing good schemes, the execution on ground is poor.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-centre-launched-schemes-but-the-poor-don-t-know-about-it-reveals-survey/story-k0Wmm5NdNj8V4rCTKSmx7N.html
23-06-2020||City||2 Kalyan-Dombivli corporators test positive for Covid-19||Two Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) corporators tested positive for Covid-19 last week. One of the corporators is admitted to Lilavati Hospital, while the other is home quarantined.“One of them has been tested positive on Friday, while the other on Saturday. We have traced the high-risk contacts of the corporators and asked them to remain in isolation. They will undergo tests. The low-risk contacts have also been quarantined and will go for tests on showing symptoms,” KDMC epidemic officer Pratiba Panpatil said.The duo had attended the standing committee meeting at the KDMC headquarters near Shivaji Chowk in Kalyan (West) on June 17. “We had followed social distancing norms in the meeting room, which was sanitised, but as a precautionary measure, all 15 of us will get tested. The two corporators had undertaken several activities in their wards to help the locals and may have contracted the virus there,” standing committee chairman Vikas Mhatre said.Meanwhile on Monday, 256 new Covid-19 cases had been reported in KDMC, taking the total number to 3,767, of which 2,092 patients are undergoing treatment, while 1,598 patients have been discharged. The four deaths reported on Monday has taken the death toll in the twin cities to 77.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-kalyan-dombivli-corporators-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-Wnv2VSxsCy1DUZkJkNRiFK.html
23-06-2020||City||Over 6 lakh passengers travelled by Mumbai local within a week after services resumed: Railways||week after the city’s lifeline was back on tracks on June 15, more than six lakh employees in essential services travelled to their workplaces on trains, the railways has said. Of these, around 2.8 lakh passengers travelled on Central Railway (CR) routes, owing to which it earned ₹1.06 crore, after issuing 91,000 tickets from June 15 to 22. Meanwhile, around 3.2 lakh passengers travelled on Western Railway, and it earned ₹52.13 lakh, after issuing 72,424 tickets during the same period.The railways has permitted only 700 passengers on one local, with around 58 passengers inside each compartment. However, it has been difficult to maintain social distancing inside the trains. “It is necessary to have staggered office timings to maintain social distancing, as fewer crowds will be seen inside compartments. More trains must also be operated,” said Subhash Gupta, president, of Rail Yatri Parishad, a passengers’ body. Meanwhile, there is no clarity over permitting bank and postal employees to travel on locals. CR officials said only employees who are eligible as per the list given by the state government are permitted. “However, only after an electronic pass is issued, will the passengers be streamlined,” said a senior CR official. The employees permitted by the state government for local train travel include those working with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), government and private hospitals, state government, collector’s office, municipal teachers, the police, Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) and the railways. The local train services had been suspended for 84 days owing to the coronavirus outbreak. On June 15, the services resumed with the first train operating at 4.03am between Panvel and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/over-6-lakh-passengers-travelled-by-mumbai-local-within-a-week-after-services-resumed-railways/story-u7L0o5ycHaXQEZ9niVnscJ.html
23-06-2020||City||1 of 5 major Covid-19 centres in Mumbai to be used as dengue, malaria facilities||With the arrival of monsoon, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided to convert one of the five jumbo Covid-19 centres into treatment facilities for dengue and malaria patients. BMC is in the process of establishing a centralised facility with around 800-1,000 beds for monsoon-related ailments at one of the centres. The five centres with 4,000-5,000 beds are located at Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC), NSCI in Worli, Nesco in Goregaon, Dahisar and Mulund. “As a large number of beds in jumbo facilities are lying vacant, we are planning to utilise the existing facilities to treat rain-related diseases under a single roof. However, we are most likely to reserve the beds with oxygen facilities for Covid-19 patients,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.The civic body has also allocated eight of its hospitals to treat only non-Covid cases and handle monsoon-related ailments, which are expected to surge by the end of June. At least 8,000 beds have been reserved in these hospitals to treat leptospirosis, dengue, malaria, typhoid and gastroenteritis patients.Kakani said non-Covid hospitals have also been instructed to set up a separate monsoon ward with necessary precautions. “Some hospitals, which partially cater to Covid-19 and non-Covid patients, have been asked to create a separate ward for monsoon-related diseases by following proper protocols to maintain sanitisation in the wards,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-of-5-major-covid-19-centres-in-mumbai-to-be-used-as-dengue-malaria-facilities/story-mzjhgNsvNxjiWU5W5UD6rL.html
23-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi fixes home isolation SOP but concerns remain||The Delhi health department on Monday issued a new set of guidelines for how patients will be assessed, requiring anyone who tests positive through a lab-based swab test to be taken to a Covid care centre where a medical officer will determine whether they are eligible for home isolation, and anyone who tests positive through a rapid antigen test be assessed on the spot at testing centres or in their localities. The guidelines ended confusion over the status of mild and asymptomatic patients after the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), headed by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, first made it mandatory on Friday that all Covid patients stay in institutional quarantine for at least five days, and then retracted the order the following day amid opposition from the Delhi government.Monday’s new guidelines – signed by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) -- appeared to reconcile some differences between DDMA and the state government on the issue of home isolation. “The new SOPs have been issued to ensure that everyone who qualifies for home isolation gets the best medical attention and anyone who doesn’t have facilities to do the same, gets moved to Covid care centres. Even if the patients are asymptomatic, we want to ensure they get regular medical attention and all the assistance they need,” said a statement issued by the government late on Monday.Just hours before that, however, the Delhi government (which has consistently pushed home isolation as a sustainable treatment option, particularly since a surge in cases could overwhelm the city’s hospitals), and DDMA appeared to be at odds over how to resolve two key questions surrounding home isolation.The first was whether all positive patients need to make at least one mandatory visit to a Covid care centre — it was part of the DDMA’s Saturday order but the Delhi government felt that it would potentially lead to a spread in infections. And the second was about a private firm that was so far handling the routine care management of Covid patients under home isolation, but whose contract was cancelled. The Delhi government roped in Portea Medical for the follow-up process with home isolation cases before the arrangement was called off by the DDMA. As part of a stop-gap arrangement, the private agency continued its followup calls till the SOP was announced on Monday.According Monday’s guidelines, follow-ups will now be carried out via telephone calls by a team “outsourced/from linked health centre/medical students from various medical colleges” for a period of nine days after a person tests positive. It was not immediately clear if the order paves the way for Portea to be engaged again. This difference in opinion manifested itself early on Monday, when deputy CM and interim health minister Manish Sisodia described DDMA’s Saturday order of mandatory assessment at a Covid care centre as impractical. “The L-G’s rule of taking all patients to CCCs is not practically possible. The district magistrates (DMs) have reported to us that they do not have enough ambulances to take patients to the CCCs. Their concern is valid also because in the entire city, we currently have only 250 government ambulances,” he said. Sisodia also said that the health department and DDMA was scheduled for a meeting around midday -- which the LG’s office denied. “There was no meeting notice issued. It is wrong on the part to the government to talk about an agenda on their own with the media first and later put it on the L-G,” said a spokesperson of the L-G office. Sisodia, the deputy chief minister, is temporarily looking after the health department after his colleague Satyendar Jain had to be hospitalised with the virus.Since Saturday, local health officials followed different rules. “Some have devised their own plan where they are continuing with the old system which was valid until Friday where a team led by the district surveillance officer (DSO) visits the house of the Covid positive patients and do all the required assessment. So, there is a lot of confusion, not just with the local teams, but more importantly, patients are also clueless,” Sisodia said earlier on Monday.While the new guidelines will likely bring uniformity on what the correct protocol is, officials at the district level say the logistical challenge will persist.“This order was given without any consultation with us. We are likely to face practical problems on ground,” said an official from one of Delhi’s 11 districts, asking not to be named. “Moving over 100 patients in each district to CCC (Covid care centre) and back will likely be a challenge. But, we will try to follow the guidelines given to us to the best of our abilities,” a second official added.The DGHS guidelines suggest every Covid positive patient will need to be assessed at a facility at least once. For those that test positive using the rapid antigen test kit – for which they are likely to have been at the testing centre or in their localities – the assessment of whether their health permits them will be made on the spot. A medical officer will determine in which category the patient’s Covid infection is – mild, moderate or severe – and check for any comorbidities. A patient with no symptoms but with an underlying health condition such as heart disease, diabetes or lung ailment will be made to stay at a Covid care centre. A separate team from the district surveillance office will determine if a person’s residence is adequate for home isolation. For people who test positive through a lab-based RT-PCR, district officials will first establish contact by phone. The patient will then be taken to a CCC for assessment, while a separate team will do a house visit.Experts said there are valid concerns on both sides of the debate on the mandatory assessments. “Home isolation is essential for managing Covid-19. The kind of care a patient gets at home he/ she will never get at a hospital. However, this is not fit for all and that is where the problem came in. 30% of Delhi lives in slums, where several people stay in the same rooms, home isolation is not feasible in such cases,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital.“But, you cannot have ten patients coming into the Covid centres just to get assessed. You would be exposing ten vehicles, ten ambulance drivers, and ten attendants to the infection. So for every ten cases, you are exposing 30 people. What is the point? Instead, sending one team with a doctor to a patient’s house is logistically more sound,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-fixes-home-isolation-sop-but-concerns-remain/story-9eMy0n0QgEfNmdT6TYxKCN.html

23-06-2020||Mumbai||After defeating Covid-19, Mumbai’s Wockhardt Hospital medicos donate blood for plasma therapy||Wockhardt Hospital, which was declared a containment zone in April after 82 members of its medical staff contracted Covid-19, has received approval from the Central government to conduct a controlled trial of convalescent plasma therapy.In April, Wockhardt Hospital was declared a containment zone after 82 members of its medical staff contracted Covid-19. More than 50 nurses were accidentally exposed to an asymptomatic Covid-positive patient. The hospital’s non-emergency services were closed till end-April. Earlier this month, the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) approved the hospital’s request for the trial of convalescent plasma therapy on 20 patients of Covid-19.Convalescent plasma therapy involves transfusion of plasma from the blood of recovered patients into those who are moderately or critically-ill. The plasma of the recovered patient contains antibodies that fight the infection. At present, 123 patients of Covid-19 are undergoing treatment at Wockhardt Hospital. Of these, 30 are in the intensive care unit (ICU).“Convalescent plasma therapy has been previously used in treating various infectious diseases such as Ebola virus outbreaks based on which we decided to initiate the trial,” said Dr Behram Pardiwala, principal investigator of the plasma trial at the hospital. “We haven’t selected a patient for the trial yet, but we will start the process soon.”Wockhardt Hospital has tied up with a blood bank where donors can donate their plasma. “We collect around 500ml plasma per donor and the dosing will be given by our clinicians asper our approved protocol. Moreover, a person can donate plasma once a month,” said Dr Parag Rindani of Wockhardt Hospital. So far, two doctors of the 82 recovered medical staffers from the hospital have donated their blood for plasma therapy.HT spoke to nurse Clera Menezes, 43, who was diagnosed with Covid-19 through cross transmission at the hospital on April 16. She resumed work on May 28 and on June 16, donated her blood. Menezes, who was asymptomatic, isolated herself at the hospital for almost 10 days and then returned to her home in Mira Road, where she again isolated herself. Menezes has two children, aged five and 12. “Every time I opened the door to keep my dishes outside, my children would come running to see me. My husband had placed the washing machine on the passage to my room as a boundary. It was so challenging to stop myself from hugging them,” she said. When she heard about the hospital conducting the plasma trial, she agreed to donate her blood. “I know the feeling of staying alone in an isolation ward. I decided to donate my blood for patients so that they can go home early to their families. I request other recovered patients come forward and donate their blood,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-defeating-covid-19-mumbai-s-wockhardt-hospital-medicos-donate-blood-for-plasma-therapy/story-MQKG8aWYHrzWFDWMzGXHmK.html

However, the status of final-year exams for professional courses and status of ATKT backlog of final-year students are yet to be clarified by the state.“Our first duty is to ensure safety of all...For professional courses, the chief minister has already written to the prime minister seeking guidance as these exams are national in nature and our students should not lose out,” tweeted cabinet minister Aaditya Thackeray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-defers-cet-for-engineering-pharmacy-architecture/story-cyp155R0d9ZeMQuPaUpK1J.html
23-06-2020||Mumbai||Jio TV, Sahyadri channel for online classes||The state government plans to use Jio TV and Sahyadri channel to impart online lectures to students from Class 1 to 12 amid the pandemic. The online teaching will begin in all state schools, aided as well as unaided, from the first week of July, using television channels, radio and other online platforms, including Google Meet, the state education department said in a meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday.Thackeray reviewed the status of online teaching and asked the department to begin these modules soon and ensure hassle-free connectivity. He was given a presentation on classes conducted using Google Meet. He has directed to take all the stakeholders into confidence before rolling out online education. This would be in addition to opening of the schools from July 1 for Classes 9, 10 and 12 in remote areas where the spread of Covid-19 is less. CM Thackeray directed the department to check the compatibility of online teaching on all electronic platforms. “The platforms should be technically foolproof with capability to resolve technical glitches immediately,” he said.“We will finalise the telecast of recorded lectures through these channels in the next four-five days. Sahyadri is charging us ₹5,000 an hour with an offer of free hours equal to the number of paid ones. Jio has dedicated two separate channels for Class 10 and 12 and has a provision of five separate channels for students from Class 1 to 12. Similarly, radio channels, too, are being engaged for online lectures, besides the use of Google Meet platform, where 250 students can join at a time,” said an official from the school education department.Shakuntala Kale, chairman, Maharashtra State Board of Secondary and Higher Secondary Education, said the HSC and SSC results will be announced by mid-July and end of July, respectively.At least 54% of Maharashtra households have smart phones required to conduct online classes, while 80% have television sets and 10% have radio sets. “We are covering almost all households with one or medium or the other, covering all 1.08 lakh schools in the state. The schools that are opening from July 1 are mostly private schools, including aided ones. Most of the areas with low Internet connectivity or no television are areas with minimum spread of the virus and the schools can open there,” the official said.The department told the CM that the Maharashtra State Council of Education Training and Research has started training teachers to conduct the classes online, at its Pune studios.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/jio-tv-sahyadri-channel-for-online-classes/story-BOjEL4WNsxBUvxa9VZwdSJ.html

This is true. Take for example Mulund and Bhandup. The main reason is there are many townships in these areas with big campuses. Residents walk and jog around in these campuses without masks. That is why the infection is spreading fast.”Chahal said the main advisory is wear masks even when stepping out of flats. He said, “Masks are not just for going out on the street. Masks are for when you leave your flat.”Residents must not interact with public without a mask other than family members living in the same household while still inside the house.Two days ago, BMC officials met with the registrar of co-operative societies that have direct control over these cooperative housing societies and townships. Chahal said the civic body has connected with the registrar over mobile messaging applications and on email, and will stay in regular touch with them.Another senior civic officer had told HT on Sunday that one of the main reasons for rise in cases in buildings is the easing of restrictions, and opening of several offices. “More people have started going to offices, and have begun taking their cars out. Interaction has increased. For example, they don’t know who is touching their car during the day. This is one of the reasons,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/wear-a-mask-every-time-you-step-out-of-your-flat-mumbai-civic-body/story-n1pa7CrB4g31WRnhQt5qYN.html
23-06-2020||City||Mumbai civic body on Mission Zero for 6 wards in city’s suburbs to curb Covid-19 cases||Civic chief IS Chahal on Monday launched ‘Mission Zero’, as part of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) rapid action plan to curb rising Covid-19 cases in the suburbs. He also inaugurated 50 ambulances given to BMC as part of a public-private partnership.Mission Zero is a 35-day action plan to increase surveillance in six suburban wards corresponding to areas of Mulund, Bhandup, Dahisar, Borivli, Kandivli, Malad and Dindoshi. It aims to reduce the growth rate of Covid-19 cases in these areas to around 1%- 1.7%, from the current 3%-3.7%.With the onset of the monsoon, BMC anticipates the number of cases will go up. “Corona cases are likely to rise in the monsoon. We are anticipating that and are prepared to handle it in terms of our bed capacity,” Chahal said.On the other hand, Chahal also said a large number of cases will be brought under control by July-end, through the rapid action plan.Speaking at the inauguration of the ambulances given by a collaboration of Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana, CREDAI-MCHI, and Desh Apanayen, Chahal said, “Over 60% of Mumbai’s cases come from these six-seven wards. The remaining 40% cases come from the other 18 wards. It will not be beneficial for us in the long run if we do not curb the rise in these areas. Cases from these suburbs will eventually travel to south Mumbai.”Chahal said BMC has instructions from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to pay more attention to these areas. He attributed the rise to Thane’s proximity to Bhandup and Mulund, and Mira Bhayander’s proximity to Dahisar and Borivli, especially since easing of restrictions has increased contact and travel. The ambulances will be operated in the suburbs by three organisations – Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana, CREDAI-MCHI and Desh Apanayen. They will act as mobile dispensaries, carrying out door-to-door screening of all residents in the suburbs for early detection of cases, and their separation from the community.Each ambulance will have a doctor and a laboratory technician. Screening will be done with an oximeter and a thermal gun. Swabs of any suspected patient will be taken immediately, and will be reported to BMC. At least 30,000 to 40,000 patients will be screened every week.“For every positive patient, we will trace up to 20 contacts. In the rest of Mumbai’s hotspots, contact tracing has been in the ratio of 1:15,” Chahal said. Bharatiya Jain Sanghatana is a Pune based non-government organisation working in the area of natural disaster response. It is headed by Shantilal Muttha. In Pune, and in rural Maharashtra, mobile dispensaries were started on April 1, and have so far screened 14 lakh citizens in 288 dispensaries. Eighteen mobile dispensaries are specially deployed for Dharavi alone.Chahal said, “Mr Muttha has promised to reduce growth rate in suburbs exactly like Dharavi and in other hotspots, and bring it to around 1.7% to 1.8%. If we contain the virus in these six to seven wards, then I think the battle is won. And our target is by June 30, it should be contained. We will have to be vigilant for four to six months for life to come back to normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-civic-body-on-mission-zero-for-6-wards-in-city-s-suburbs-to-curb-covid-19-cases/story-fX04AANxCrXAc43YQSJhVJ.html
23-06-2020||Mumbai||Grant provisional admission to RTE students: State||To ensure that more than one lakh students who have been allotted seats under the Right To Education (RTE) quota across the state do not stay out of school, the education department has asked schools to complete their admission process and grant them provisional admissions. Of the total seats in a school, 25% seats are reserved under RTE quota.In a circular issued last week, the department has asked schools to call parents of such students in phases, check their documents and grant provisional admissions as the new academic year has already begun on June 15. Conventionally, a screening committee scrutinises documents of students before sending them to respective schools. However, due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the department has decided to admit students for now and complete detailed verification later. “Parents of these students can be sent messages on their phones stating the date and time to report for submitting documents. Three chances should be given to them in case they are not able to be present on the first given date. Students should be enrolled for online classes even if the actual admission will take place later after verification of documents,” stated the letter issued by the department. For schools that fall under containment zones and those which were used for quarantining people, the process could take place a little later after the situation improves and the schools are sanitised, added the circular. An official from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s education department said admissions have not started yet. “It may take a week to start the process as the centralised online system is still being updated,” said the official. This year a total of 14,135 students applied for RTE seats in Mumbai, of whom 5,371 have been allotted schools through the online lottery. Over one lakh students were selected in a lottery for admissions to Senior KG and Class 1 under the quota across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/grant-provisional-admission-to-rte-students-state/story-wC0LUIALoPOY9Ycm8fFDGM.html
23-06-2020||Mumbai||State, Centre asked to clarify stand on ICSE and ISC exams||The Bombay high court (HC) has asked the state government to make it clear whether it would allow the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations (CISCE) to conduct its rescheduled ICSE and ISC board exams for Class 10 and 12, respectively, in July. The court has also asked the Centre to inform it about the decision of the home ministry which was directed by the Allahabad high court to decide on a representation seeking cancellation of rescheduled board exams in view of the pandemic. The high court also added that though CISCE has set June 24 as the deadline for students in Maharashtra to choose if they wanted to appear for the pending exams or be graded based on their previous performance, the interests of the students would be safeguarded regardless of the option they chose.A division bench headed by chief justice Dipankar Datta while hearing the petition filed by Arvind Tiwari, a parent and advocate, was informed by the counsel for CISCE that it had not prepared the formula for marking students as directed by the court in the earlier hearing. The council sought time which the bench allowed.The court had directed the board to clarify on the marking or grading method that they would adopt if students opt out of the rescheduled exams in July. The council had said either the students appear for the rescheduled exams or they would get marks for the board exams based on internal assessment or the pre-board exams conducted by the respective schools. Tiwari had, however, sought clarity on the same.The court then asked advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni to convey to the bench the state’s stand on whether it would allow the council to conduct the exams.The bench then directed the Central government, through additional solicitor general Anil Singh, to inform the bench as to what decision was taken by the ministry of home affairs after a writ petition filed before the Allahabad high court seeking cancellation of pending CBSE and CISCE board exams was referred to the ministry.Thereafter, while expressing apprehension about conducting exams amid the rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, the bench said till the CISCE submits the methodology, the parents and students need not take any decision on the options given by the board. The bench further assured that even if the students and parents do or do not decide on the option by June 24, they need not worry and posted the matter for hearing on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-centre-asked-to-clarify-stand-on-icse-and-isc-exams/story-sc8EEZGJdc4Ilr1zNZAjwL.html
23-06-2020||Mumbai||BMC set to increase bed capacity to 1 lakh||Anticipating a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) plans to increase Mumbai’s hospital bed capacity to 1 lakh by the end of this month. This number would include all beds in quarantine centres, dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and health centres; beds in intensive care units (ICU) and oxygen-supported beds. BMC estimates Covid-positive cases in the city may go up to 80,000 by the end of June.On Monday, Mumbai recorded 1, 098 new cases of Covid-19, taking the total number of infected cases in the city to 67, 586; and 630 patients were discharged. Dharavi reported 14 new cases on Monday, taking its total to 2,184. The city also recorded 66 deaths, taking the death toll to 3, 737. Of the 66 deaths, 20 were recorded in last 48 hours and 46 were from before June 19. The city’s doubling rate — the time taken for cases to double — has gone up to 37. According to BMC, 2.69 lakh tests for Covid-19 had been conducted till Sunday.Municipal commissioner IS Chahal said on Monday that BMC will increase bed capacity in the city from the current 84,000 to 1 lakh. “We are planning it in such a way that even if our cases double, our beds should be sufficient,” said Chahal. “Actual number of people admitted to hospitals and symptomatic is nearly 9, 500 out of the total active patients,” he added.Chahal said the strength of ICU beds in the city would be increased to 300 by June 25 and by July 5, another 200 beds would be added. “When I took charge, we had 3,500 beds including dedicated Covid-19 health centres (DCHC) and dedicated Covid-19 hospitals (DCH). Today, we have 12,000 beds. By June 31, it will increase to 15,000 and later we will scale it up to 20,000 by July 31,” said Chahal. DCHC are for those with mild to moderate cases of Covid-19 and DCH are for critical patients with comorbidity.Of the 84,000 beds for Covid-19 patients, 60,000 are at Covid care centres (CCC) 1 and 2. All high-risk contacts are being shifted to CCC 1, which are located in hotels, newly-constructed buildings and similar structures. Under the new rules, asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients are in CCC 2, which are government-run centres with doctors and nurses on duty round the clock.As per the new rules, patients get test results from the local ward office which also allots beds at a health centre. Chahal said, “The ward team then starts calling people, informing them of their test results and by 3pm of the same day, a bed is allotted to the patient.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-set-to-increase-bed-capacity-to-1-lakh/story-SjUJLPecDsLZqRO2RsswYJ.html
23-06-2020||Mumbai||Covid-19 patients to be allotted beds at private hospitals first, says BMC||To give a breather to doctors and staff at municipal hospitals and ensure all beds in private hospitals that have been handed over to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) are occupied, the civic body has decided to prioritise allotting beds at private hospital to Covid-19 patients first. Only after beds at private hospitals — 80% of their capacity — are occupied will beds at municipal hospital beds be allotted.“Private hospitals told BMC their beds are vacant often and they suffer financial loss. We told them BMC will fill private hospital beds first, and once 100% of the 80% beds are occupied, we will move on to allotting municipal hospital beds to patients. My municipal doctors are over-burdened. They will be relieved of some stress. Both will be happy this way,” said municipal commissioner IS Chahal on Monday.Chahal also recounted a recent conversation he’d had with the dean of BYL Nair Hospital. “The dean called me yesterday [Sunday] to tell me they had vacant Covid beds for the first time on Sunday. I told him, ‘By first week of July, you will have 25% beds vacant’. Whatever private hospital beds there are in BMC’s control, will be utilised first. Our doctors need rest. Our hospitals need to be relieved of stress,” he said.All doctors at war rooms at the ward level, who are in charge of calling patients who have tested positive and coordinating with them for hospitalisation or quarantine, have been given an ascending order: First fill up local beds; then private hospital beds; then semi-government beds; and then municipal hospital beds.Dr V Ravishankar, chief executive officer and consultant cardiac surgeon at Lilavati Hospital, said, “We are already accepting all BMC patients to full capacity, which is 80% of general Covid ward beds and 80% of Covid ICU beds. There is maximum utilisation as per notification and BMC auditors are in hospital every day to monitor this.”Dr Gautam Bhansali, chief coordinator of private hospitals with BMC, said, “Since the last two weeks, we have been managing bed allocation to patients this way. First, private hospital beds are utilised. When they are full, municipal hospital beds are allotted, through the main BMC dashboard. None of the private hospitals turn down any walk-in patient. The only condition is to inform BMC to reduce one vacant bed against the hospital’s name on the dashboard because it has been utilised.”Bhansali said this has ensured every patient is given a bed and there is no wait time for any patient. “No deaths should occur because a patient did not get a bed on time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-19-patients-to-be-allotted-beds-at-private-hospitals-first-says-bmc/story-0Au1E5OMggQKOZcO923VfP.html
23-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh admn put on notice on schools’ plea against collection of fee only||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Monday put the Chandigarh administration on notice after a plea was received from the city’s private schools, challenging UT’s move to allow schools to only charge tuition fee during the lockdown.The high court bench of justice BS Walia has sought response from UT by July 1. The plea has been filed by Independent Schools’ Association Chandigarh, a body of 78 private schools of the city.The body has sought quashing of the notification issued on June 3 by the UT adviser to the administrator under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, directing schools to collect only monthly tuition fee from students till further orders, without increasing it for the academic year 2020-21. The schools were also directed to neither stop payment nor reduce the monthly salary of the teaching and non-teaching staff.The association told the court that to ensure the students did not suffer, they had been making painstaking efforts in providing education and holding classes online. The members said the UT’s orders were without competence, as though the fees could be regulated, the UT had no legislative power under the 2005 Act and the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, 2016, directing schools to not increase the fee.The schools said that the fee regulatory body was a lawfully created entity, and in case of violations, it was the body that must act against the violator, and not the education department, the court was told.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-admn-put-on-notice-on-schools-plea-against-collection-of-fee-only/story-QumFOhkFHceZkBDZLGWp2N.html
23-06-2020||City||GMADA allots ₹83 crore for development of Pearl City’s Sectors 100, 104 in Mohali||The 1,300 allottees of the Pearl City project covering Sectors 100 and 104 of Mohali can now heave a sigh of relief as the Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) has finally prepared estimates of around ₹83 crore for internal development works in the two sectors.The fate of the allottees had been hanging in the balance since 2014, after its chairman-cum-managing director Nirmal Singh Bhangoo was booked by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in a ₹45,000-crore Ponzi scam.The CBI had also attached all properties of Pearls Agrotech Corporation Limited (PACL), including the mega housing project launched in 2006. After that the Supreme Court had tasked GMADA to develop the society.Around 160 families reside in both the sectors spread over 450 acres, where people have invested around ₹600 crore in plots. Yet these sectors neither have a sewerage system, nor proper roads, nor streetlights.BUDGET TO BE SUBMITTED IN SC SOON A senior GMADA official said, “We have prepared a budget of ₹83 crore for the internal development of both the sectors. The budget will be submitted in the apex court soon.”On March 4 this year, acting on the petition filed by the Pearl City Mohali Residents’ Welfare Association, the apex court had directed GMADA to prepare a detailed estimate plan for internal development works in the two sectors. During the hearing, the court also asked GMADA to submit details of members with pending payments and other related documents.Internal development comprises construction of internal roads, laying of sewerage lines, landscaping, electrification, construction of a sewage treatment plant and water supply lines.Association president Kulbir Singh Sidhu said: “We are hopeful that GMADA will soon start the internal development works of both sectors.”In February this year, GMADA had filed an affidavit in the apex court, stating that it is ready to do internal development works if the Lodha Committee provides them the funds. Following this, the court had directed GMADA to prepare detailed estimates and submit the report within a month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gmada-allots-83-crore-for-development-of-pearl-city-s-sectors-100-104-in-mohali/story-SxXduFP5IRdJi15orr66lM.html

23-06-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra allows rapid antigen tests||In a significant move, the Maharashtra government on Monday allowed rapid antigen tests. It has been allowed on patients with severe coronavirus symptoms, comorbidities and pregnant women, stated the order issued by health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas. The rapid antigen kits, called Standard Q Covid-19 Ag detection, provides results in only half-an-hour, which will help decide the further course of treatment for a serious patient at the earliest. It will also be used to know the prevalence of the pandemic among masses, officials said. The health department has also authorised municipal corporations to decide about using rapid antigen tests in large numbers in containment zones or hotspots. It is developed by South Korean company SD Biosensor. The testing method involves looking for antibodies, which are produced when the body is exposed to a pathogenApart from being quicker than lab-based RT-PCR tests, antigen tests are cheaper — one kit costs ₹450 — and differ in technology as they look for the specific protein associated with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19. The lab tests look for the exact nucleic signatures of the virus.Meanwhile, the number of testing laboratories has also increased in the state to 104 from 95. This has also led to increase in sample testing capacity of the state to over 25,000 tests a day. State health minister Rajesh Tope made the announcement.“We are preparing for the peak, which is yet to come. We will further increase our testing capacity to be prepared for any situation,” said a senior official, wishing not to be named.Wedding halls set to openThe state allowed wedding ceremonies at non air-conditioned wedding halls, open lawns, banquet halls and in the backyards of houses, in the presence of less than 50 people. “All social distancing norms should be strictly followed,” the order said. According to officials, it was issued after demands by various organisations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maharashtra-allows-rapid-antigen-tests/story-0prCW39Omta4imNQEiBOGK.html
23-06-2020||City||Now, Chandigarh has no containment zone||Chandigarh: After more than a month and a half, the UT administration denotified the last remaining containment zone in the city — Pocket No. 15 in Sector 26’s Bapu Dham Colony — on Monday.With this, no area in the city is a designated containment zone, though some house blocks, including in Bapu Dham Colony, continue to be quarantined after fresh Covid-19 cases have been reported there recently.For containing the spread of the virus, the administration had declared six areas as containment zones on May 2. Strict perimeter control was enforced in these areas, which included parts of Sectors 30, 38 and 52 besides Shastri Nagar in Manimajra, Kachi Colony in Dhanas and Bapu Dham Colony in Sector 26.On the basis of a report submitted by the affected area committee, UT administrator VPS Badnore on Monday decided to open up all pockets in Bapu Dham Colony, except for a few house blocks. With this order, perimeter control has also been removed from Pockets No. 7, 13 and 20, which were buffer zone. However, a few house blocks in Pockets No. 4, 5, 15 and 16 continue to be under strict perimeter control.Norms flouted as credit war ensues While barricades were being removed from Pocket No. 15, heavy jostling and sloganeering were witnessed with supporters of both the Congress and BJP trying to take the credit for relaxations.During the melee, social distancing norms were flouted with impunity. Police had intervene and separate supporters of both parties.City Congress president Pardeep Chhabra said, “The local councillor failed to turn up here for nearly three months while people were in trouble. Now, he has come to take all the credit for opening up of the area.”On the other hand, councillor Dalip Sharma, who belongs to the BJP, said: “Congress workers and their city president didn’t help Bapu Dham Colony residents all these months. We have worked for all the 20 pockets of the colony. Now, they want to take all the credit, where none is due.”Meanwhile, keeping in view reports of frequent violation of social distancing norms, the administration will start a special drive to impose on-the-spot fines on people found not wearing masks in public places and violating other rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/now-chandigarh-has-no-containment-zone/story-DJoE58X0zDeSdB9b5X3AQI.html
23-06-2020||Mumbai||87.92% Covid cases in Maha are from 19 cities||Maharashtra’s Covid-19 case tally on Monday jumped to 135,796 after 3,721 more infections were reported. The state currently has 61,793 active cases, the health department said, as officials expect cases to peak in July with the number of fresh infections likely to rise in the coming days. Monday was the 13th day the state reported over 3,000 cases.Maharashtra on Monday recorded 113 deaths, taking the toll to 6,283. Sixty-two deaths were from the past 48 hours, while 51 were over the past few days, health officials said.Mumbai, the worst-hit city across the country, recorded 1,098 cases as its count reached 67,586. Of them, 29,720 are active cases. The city toll stands at 3,737 after 66 deaths were reported. Most of the fresh Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra are coming from 19 cities — the nine municipal corporations of the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), Pune, Solapur, Aurangabad, Malegaon, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, Akola, Amravati and Nagpur. They constitute 87.92% of the total cases in the state.These cities have also reported a surge of over 50,000 cases in the past 19 days, since lockdown restrictions were eased. On June 3, the cities that were earmarked as red zones had 67,885 cases and on June 22, they had 1,19,402.As part of its ‘Mission Begin Again’ to ease the lockdown, the state government from June 3 had allowed outdoor activities such as jogging, running, cycling in open grounds and stadium. From June 5, it allowed shops and marketplaces to be opened and from June 8, it also allowed private offices to open with a strength of maximum 10 people.It further allowed inter-district movement in MMR and allowed BEST buses to ply in the region from June 5.“Going by the fresh projections, the peak is likely to come in July. If that happens, it will take another month for the cases to decline and by September, the situation may come under complete control. It also means that cases will rise further for the time being,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.“You know lockdown cannot be imposed forever and unlocking was the need of the hour. The state government was under tremendous pressure from all sides for relaxing restrictions. So, we augmented the health infrastructure and also allowed graded relaxations to ensure situation will remain under control,” said a senior official who was a member of the task force formed by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to tackle the pandemic.Chief secretary Ajoy Mehta said that the situation is in under control and the rise in number is also static. “I can say that the situation of Maharashtra is in control. After relaxations were allowed, fresh cases did rise, but by and large they are static in nature. I don’t think they will increase until more relaxations will be allowed,” Mehta told Marathi news channel ABPMajha on Monday.Another concerning issue is the rising case fatality rate (CFR) that reached 4.67% on Sunday. 45.59% of the total deaths in the country are registered in Maharashtra alone. By the end of May, the state had successfully brought down the CFR to 3.26% from 7.41% (with 148 deaths) on April 13. But it has started rising again.“Our CFR is increasing, but a lot of work is silently going on to control it. Clear instructions have been issued to admit patients immediately if found any symptoms. If patients are admitted early then the treatment can be started in the golden hour and he or she can be saved from slipping into a serious condition. Our taskforce of expert doctors is updating the line of treatment on a regular basis and very soon CFR will come down,” the chief secretary said.Last week, Thackeray, in a review meeting, directed the constitution of a taskforce comprising experts and senior doctors at district or division level to bring down CFR “The highest single-day toll of 186 deaths was recorded on June 21. According to the state, barring Mumbai, reconciliation of deaths in all districts and municipal corporations has been completed.The recovery rate reached 49.86% after 1,962 patients recovered in the past 24 hours. The total number of recovered patients is 67,706 On June 16, the state’s recovery rate was 50.99%The health department declared it has conducted 7,87,419 tests at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 651,623 people tested negative. It means 17.2% of the total samples tested positive, said an official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/87-92-covid-cases-in-maha-are-from-19-cities/story-IpsN004v4EwUTvKsy0cPKI.html
23-06-2020||Chandigarh||Now, 14-day home quarantine must for people visiting Chandigarh for over 72 hours||The UT administration on Monday made 14-day self home quarantine mandatory for all visitors to Chandigarh who intend to stay here for more than 72 hours. A visitor violating home quarantine will be shifted to institutional quarantine, and can face fine or even jail under provisions of the Disaster Management Act.The mandatory home quarantine will not be applicable to Mohali or Panchkula residents travelling to the city.Currently, the UT has open borders with only random screening at the city’s entry points and an advise for self quarantine. Those visiting the city from outside the tricity have to register themselves with the administration on its website, and carry an online self-generated form detailing their antecedents. Police can penalise visitors without the forms.WHY CHANGE IN POLICYThe decision came after, in the daily review meeting, UT administrator VPS Badnore expressed concern over the rise in number of Covid-19 cases. He noted that in the recent past, most positive cases have been found among people coming from outside.More than 50% of cases reported in the city in the past week have either been of those with travel history or their contacts. Also, with the lockdown restrictions removed, tracing community contacts of positive patients has become a tough task for municipal corporation teams.“Many casual visitors are coming here, keeping in view easy availability of medical facility and absence of mandatory quarantine conditions. We need to discourage such avoidable visits. Chandigarh hospitals need not get congested by crowds overflowing from outside the tricity,” said UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida.DETAILED ORDER AWAITEDBadnore directed Arun Kumar Gupta, principal secretary, health, to issue specific orders regarding the mandatory self-home quarantine for visitors. These are expected on Tuesday.Stating that visitors who violate the mandatory quarantine will be penalised, Parida said, “We will pick them up and put them in institutional quarantine. Under the Disaster Management Act, they can be fined and jailed too. Police will keep a tab on movement of visitors and on any such violation.”However, the administration is unlikely to paste quarantine notices outside houses of such visitors, said an official.Badnore also appealed to residents’ welfare associations, voluntary agencies and social activists to co-operate with the health and police authorities in monitoring the stay and movement of persons coming from outside.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/now-14-day-home-quarantine-must-for-people-visiting-chandigarh-for-over-72-hours/story-HLEWrY1neu241NKsj56qON.html
23-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram city has 100 containment zones||Gurugram city had a total 100 containment zones in the city as on Monday, as per the latest order issued by Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner. Health officials said that 20 new containment zones have been added to the list, while 10 areas had been de-notified. On Monday, 85 new Covid-18 cases were reported, taking the total tally of infected persons in the district to 4,512. Out of these, 1,820 are active cases. The death count in the district stands at 66.Besides 100 in the city ,there were seven other containment zones in the district located in Pataudi, Sohna and in Farrukh Nagar. Some of the new areas added to the city’s list are Jal Vayu Vihar, sector 56, 37, 49, DLF Phase 3, Uniworld Garden sector 47, Parsavnath Towers Sohna Road among others. Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner, said, “We are increasing the enforcement of norms in containment zones, as we have seen strict compliance often goes a long way in containing the disease. We are increasing the awareness campaign in the affected areas also.”A lane in a gated society or a tower in condominium is defined as a containment zone if five Covid-19 cases are reported within one kilometre perimetre of the area where the case is reported.By Monday, only 10 areas were de-notified. An area is de-notfied after a tentative period of 28 days post the discharge of the last Covid-19 patient. Dr MP Singh, nodal officer for containment zones said, “The list prepared by the health department is different from the one issued by the administration. It would be difficult to comment on which areas have been de-notified.” The district administration has also launched awareness vehicles – autorickshaws – that will roam in Covid-affected parts of the city creating awareness about preventing the spread of the virus. Twenty such autos will ply, out of which 10 will be covering thein containment zones of Gurugram, while five each will be deputed in Sohna and Pataudi.Last week, Vijay Vardhan, Haryana home secretary, also visited the city and directed the district administration to focus on strict vigilance in containment zones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-city-has-100-containment-zones/story-5s8I13oT3mcfjw1SBMQjrI.html
23-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Positivity-rate falls sharply in five days due to increase in private testing||The district’s test-positivity rate (TPR) between June 18 and June 22 dipped to between 12 and 18 percent, as opposed to significantly higher positivity —between 46 to 77 percent— between June 10 and June 17.This, experts and officials said, can be attributed to a sharp increase in private testing, which Gurugram has witnessed over the past five days.Between June 18 and June 21, around 69 percent of 2,027 samples collected from the district were by private laboratories, shows the district health bulletin data. During this period, Gurugram began testing upwards of 500 samples per day, as opposed to the preceding several weeks, when the district was testing between 300 to 350 samples per day. For comparison, between June 10 to June 17, only about 39 percent of the 1833 samples were collected privately (excluding data for two days when this metric did not figure in the bulletin).“The data suggests that the daily pool of samples being tested is growing, owing mainly to the private labs pitching in. If the government were to enhance its testing capabilities and do more targeted tests through contact tracing, you will likely see the test-positivity rate rise again,” said Dheeraj Singh, a data scientist who has been tracking Gurugram’s Covid-19 data.Health department officials seemed to agree. “We have seen that more and more people are choosing to get independently tested at private labs, especially over the last three to four days. This is a positive step. It shows that citizens are not averse to being tested. With Haryana reducing the price from Rs 4500 to Rs 2400 for a test, we expect private labs to be reporting even more samples in coming days,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.At present, there are seven private laboratories empaneled to conduct tests in the district, of which all are now operational, according to a ‘preparedness report’ submitted by the deputy commissioner to the Centre’s National Health Mission on June 18. A copy of the report was obtained by Hindustan Times on Monday. It states that these seven private labs are expected to have a capacity of 5,000 RT-PCR tests by the same date.“At present, private laboratories in the city have the capacity to test between 700 to 1,000 samples per day. By July end, they will be able to do up to 3,000 RT PCR tests per day, then 5,000 per day after that. If more people opt to get tested on their own, it would significantly complement the health department’s efforts,” said a district level official with the Integrated Disease Surveillance Program.Health department officials also stated that they are on their way to augmenting government testing facilities in the district as well. According to the deputy commissioner’s preparedness report, the health department is aiming to conduct 2,000 confirmatory RT-PCR tests daily by July 15. In addition to this, the department also plans to conduct at least 20,000 antigen tests per day by July end, with 46,000 tests per day by July 15, the deputy commissioner’s report shows.The representative of two private labs could not be connected for a comment by HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-positivity-rate-falls-sharply-in-five-days-due-to-increase-in-private-testing/story-XPYbGvpDYed8oechr1gHPJ.html
23-06-2020||Gurugram||Haryana Police’s Special Task Force arrests four people involved in stealing luxury cars||The special task force (STF) of Haryana Police, on Sunday, arrested four people — including three officials of the Regional Transport Office(RTO) posted in Meham in Haryana — for allegedly preparing fake documents and selling stolen cars in at least six states. They were involved in stealing cars in Delhi-NCR, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, said the police.The suspects were identified as Praveen Kumar of Dadri, along with Anil Kumar, Krishan Kumar and Sombir Singh of Rohtak. Kumar was allegedly driving a stolen car when he was arrested and revealed the names of the other gang members, who were arrested the same night, the police said. According to the police, there are at least 15 more gang members who re yet to be arrested. The police have allegedly recovered 14 SUVs from various locations that were stolen from Meerut, Delhi, and Rajasthan and have found forged documents from the possession of the gang members.The incident came to light after several people complained to the police of their respective areas that their newly bought cars had been stolen. During the investigation, it was found that stolen cars were sold with forged documents after their engine, chassis and registration numbers were changed.Satheesh Balan, deputy inspector-general, STF, said that they have seized documents from several agents which were prepared from the office of the RTO. “Investigation of these documents revealed that three RTO officers, including the computer operator, were preparing forged documents and were helping the suspects in selling their stolen luxury cars,” he said adding that they have been arrested. According to the police, the gang would conduct a reconnaissance of the residential areas in different cities and target newly bought luxury cars, which were sold at 50% of the original cost.“The gang members used to train agents to approach car dealers dealing in second-hand cars and even gave them a commission of ₹50,000 on each sale. They also used to upload pictures of second-hand cars on online advertisement platforms, and would sometimes place advertisements in newspapers in different states,” said Balan.The police said the suspects used to drive cars to Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan and sold them for at least ₹5 lakh each. Balan said several cases of vehicle theft have been filed against them in different states and they have sold nearly 2,000 cars so far. We do not have exact details of all cases, but the arrested men revealed that only a few vehicle- lifting cases were of Gurugram. We are yet to arrest 15 more members of the gang involved in vehicle-lifting who were part of this gang,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/haryana-police-s-special-task-force-arrests-four-people-involved-in-stealing-luxury-cars/story-NQHBK9wBzCP3C9RaFw9NHI.html
23-06-2020||Gurugram||HSVP to initiate action against illegal commercial encroachments||Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) has decided to take action against illegal vends, kiosks and other such commercial encroachments in the plots owned by the authority. Officials said that the decision was taken after complaints were lodged by concerned residents that milk booths and other such illegal vends had been set up in various HSVP plots without taking due permission from the authority. According to officials a survey has revealed that there are at least two dozen such booths across various sectors, such as 27, 28, 30, 31, 42, 43, 45, 47, 51 and 52. These booths and vends are being identified and soon action would be taken against them, said HSVP officials privy to the matter. HS Jakhar, sub-divisional engineer, said that no encroachment on the authority’s land would be allowed and strict action will be taken against such establishments. Earlier, the authority had taken action against similar encroachments in Sector 29, where people were found to be using HSVP land to run illegal commercial operations. According to HSVP officials, several city residents have lodged complaints against such illegal encroachments, especially in the green belts of the city. The chief administrator of HSVP will also hold a meeting with officials on June 25 to discuss various measures that have been taken in their respective jurisdictions to remove illegal encroachments and ensure the security of properties owned by the authority, said officials. “Several illegal vends and kiosks have been identified across the city and action is being initiated against them,” said Jakhar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/hsvp-to-initiate-action-against-illegal-commercial-encroachments/story-h2bCxTRmfrTxoLPyBfm3SN.html
23-06-2020||Gurugram||Only 60 patients in Gurugram under institutional isolation facilities||Gurugram may be witnessing an exponential surge in Covid-19 cases, but its isolation facilities — set up by the district administration in different hotels and guest houses of the city — have found very few takers.Data shows that only 60 — of Gurugram’s 1,820 active cases — are under isolation in selected hotels, where the district administration has already reserved more than 1,100 beds on a paid basis.As per the district health bulletin, 4,512 coronavirus cases have been reported in the city so far. Out of these, 1,820 are active cases. Out of the active cases, nearly 65% — 1,193 patients — are under home isolation, 106 are in the dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, and 461 are hospitalised in other private hospitals of the city. Only 60 patients — 3.2% of the total active cases — are in institutional isolation facilities set up at hotels as Covid Care Centres.Of the 60, at least 15 are in private paid hotels, while 45 are in government paid hotels. As reported by HT on June 21, senior doctors believe that reluctance of Covid-19 patients to stay in institutional facilities is adding to the number of patients requiring critical care. An institutional isolation facility is set up for Covid-19 patients who do not have enough space at home or can’t be home isolated, especially those with mild symptoms. It can also be opted for by those patients who do not want to transmit the virus to their family members or others in the neighbourhood. Recently, Delhi government had issued orders for five-day institutional isolation for all Covid-19 patients. The order was later retracted by the government as it was against the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. As per a district administration order, there are 13 designated hotels for self-paid isolation facilities. Over 464 beds have been reserved in these hotels for Covid patients with mild or moderate symptoms. Also, these facilities can also be used by patients who are asymptomatic but can’t be home isolated due to lack of space in their houses. Likewise, 1,132 beds have been kept aside in 26 hotels of the city, which are to act like government paid isolation facilities. As per the data shared by the health department, only 45 Covid-19 patients are availing the facility. In the government paid facilities, the charges are nominal and is set at Rs 700, including taxes, which includes three meal. In the self -paid facilities the charges vary from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,200. Patients who have opted for self-paid service are currently kept in Ginger hotel, sector 14, while others are in hotels of old Gurugram. Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner, who is also the monitoring in-charge for Covid-19 situation in Gurugram, admitted that people were hesitant in opting for institutional isolation.“Nearly 85% patients are asymptomatic and prefer home isolation. Our teams advise them for institutional isolation. Some people think it is expensive. Others have issues like homecare and home cooked meals. We will be advertising about our government-paid facilities to break the chain of transmission and to avoid patients becoming critical.” Currently, 129 patients are in a critical condition and on ventilator support in the city. The number of patients requiring critical care has increased in the city. Till June 15, there were 48 patients on life support system. Officials said that the figures were low due to poor feeding of data by private hospitals on the common portal, which is now being streamlined.Dr Dhruv Chaudhary of PGIMS Rohtak, who is also the nodal officer for Covid-19 tertiary care in the state, said, “Citizens are still getting an understanding of the disease. It is for this reason that they are confused where to be admitted if they test positive. Mandatory institutional isolation of patients with mild symptoms would prevent transmission along with better management of positive cases.”Nitin, owner of a hotel in sector 18, which has been turned into a government-paid isolation facility, said he has not had a single patient come stay till now. “Patients are referred to hotels by the health team. To avoid transmission of Covid-19, patients are put in one facility instead of being kept in several locations.”Health policy expert, Dr Preeti Kumar of Public Health Foundation of India, said, “Ideally home isolation is best for most Covid positive people as the large majority will have mild symptoms and can makefull recovery. Good home compliance will ensure that the infection is not transmitted to family members or to the community and is also good for the patients overall well being and mental health. This also does not put unnecessary strain on the already stretched healthcare system. However, in some cases, if the treating doctor feels that certain patients may not be able to self isolate, or have existing serious co-comorbidities, or are elderly, then they may take the decision to provide institutional or facility based isolation for better management.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/only-60-patients-in-gurugram-under-institutional-isolation-facilities/story-LDTmacozG8mr57mGtk5QEM.html
23-06-2020||Chandigarh||Nearly half of those who succumbed to virus in Haryana were below 55||Elderly persons in the age group 55-84 years constituted 49% of Covid-19 patients who succumbed to the respiratory illness till June 21 in Haryana. Due to decreased immunity, body reserves and multiple associated diseases, elderly persons being at an increased risk of infection and higher mortality is now an established fact. However, what has come as a surprise is that 40% (see graphic) of those who died due to Covid-19 in the state were relatively young (in 35-54 age group), according to the data analysed by the Haryana health department.Dr Usha Gupta, director, health services, Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP), said it is suspected that many relatively younger patients succumbed to the infection because of prevalence of comorbidities (an existing disease or medical condition) like diabetes and tuberculosis. “Also, there was an instance of a young drug addict dying due to coronavirus disease in Panipat,” she said indicating the role of substance abuse in fatality of young patients. About 60% of the total patients who died due to Covid-19 infection had comorbidites. However, Dr Gupta said a final conclusion in this regard will be drawn after an audit of the deaths is conducted.YOUNGER POPULATION MORE AFFECTEDQuoting statistics, health officials said 3,713 persons in 35-54 age group and 3,068 persons in 25-34 age group were infected by the contagion between March 17 and June 21. In comparison, only 1,623 elderly (55-84 years) got infected.“Younger persons are relatively more active and have higher mobility making them vulnerable to the infection. Most persons in the 25-34 and 35-54 age groups have to go out for work and have a higher rate of exposure,” said a health sector expert.PRIVATE EMPLOYEES, TRADERS MOST INFECTEDStatistics show that about 37% of the persons infected so far were either employed in the private sector or had their own enterprise.About 14% of those infected were housewives, 9% were students and 6 % were the health staff.About 6% government employees, including those in the police and defence forces, contracted the disease. About 3% farmers and labourers, 1% each vendors and drivers and 6% health staff were infected in the state. The department is still investigating the occupations of 12% patients, while 10% have been categorised in the miscellaneous occupations group.Health officials said 13 districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat, Rohtak, Ambala, Palwal, Bhiwani, Karnal, Hisar, Mahendergarh, Jhajjar, Rewari and Nuh — constituted the major part of total coronavirus cases in Haryana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nearly-half-of-those-who-succumbed-to-virus-in-haryana-were-below-55/story-Mk8kPvLXIqyi6icJIXusYM.html

23-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram police crack down on people not wearing masks in public||Gurugram police on Monday launched a massive drive to penalise people for not wearing masks in public places in the city. Each offender nabbed without a mask was penalised and given five masks by the police personnel, officers said.Police commissioner Muhammad Akil said that despite regular patrolling and public announcements, many people were not wearing masks due to which they were forced to crackdown and start a drive to penalize them. Every offender was given masks to keep in their vehicles, office and home so that they never venture out without one. “Earlier also we were distributing masks to the public. People, often after getting caught, claim that they forgot their masks at their home or in office,” Akil said. The offence is punishable with a fine up to Rs 500.A senior police officer said that at least 1,200 people were penalised on the spot on Monday. The aim of the drive, he added. was to ensure that everyone follows protocols to prevent the spread of Covid-19. Akil said he has passed an order in the district asking all officers to ensure all offenders are penalised on the spot and their family members are informed about their carelessness.The order stated that officials need to collect Rs 500 fine on the spot from the violator and hand him/her a set of five masks . They are also to be sensitised them about the importance of wearing masks.According to the police, since May 1 this year, at least 10,427 people have been booked under sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Epidemic Act, 1897 and the Haryana Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 Regulations, 2020 for not wearing masks while stepping out of their residences.The civic agencies had also started taking action against the offender under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code for disobedience to order duly promulgated by a public servant. Municipal Corporation Gurugram (MCG) had issued nearly 500 challans between May 15 and June 20, and collected a sum of Rs 2.50 lakh from people not wearing masks in public places.“We are fining people who are not wearing a face masks in public places. We want to ensure that this acts as a deterrent and people are more careful amid the coronavirus outbreak. We have also launched a seven-day drive starting Monday to fine people on a larger scale,” said Akil.On June 22, at least 85 new cases of Covid-19 were reported, taking the total tally of cases in the district to 4512. Gurugram has so far witnessed 66 fatalities from the disease. The district administration made wearing of masks mandatory on April 10. However,crackdowns were only launched after May 6, when a direction was issued to all municipal corporations across the state by the directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB), to start fining violators.The municipal corporations can fine a person Rs 500 if he or she doesn’t wear a mask under Section 381 of the Haryana Municipal Corporation Act, 1994. Officials said that action under Section 188 of IPC, which invites a penalty of Rs 200 and/or imprisonment of up to one month, could also be initiated, if the need arises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-police-crack-down-on-people-not-wearing-masks-in-public/story-n7Wx4qOJscw5ghHiLSvoAM.html
23-06-2020||City||Murdered man cremated as Covid-19 victim in Faridabad||Gurugram: The body of a 28-year-old man, who was allegedly murdered three days ago, was cremated by the Faridabad municipal workers who were handed over the body by the hospital staff, mistaking it of a Covid-19 patient, said police on Monday.KK Rao, commissioner of police, Faridabad, said that the man was murdered and his five relatives were seriously injured after they were allegedly attacked with iron rods, sticks and knives by a group in Subhash Colony of Ballabhgarh on Friday evening. According to the police, the deceased, identified as Sonu Khan, was rushed to a government hospital in Faridabad, where doctors declared him brought dead and his body was kept in the mortuary for postmortem.The next day when the deceased’s family members reached the mortuary, they found the body missing, said the police.“The family members have complained against the hospital staff for their alleged involvement in accidentally cremating the body of Khan. They are suspecting that the accused party had conspired with hospital staff and have demanded action against them,” said Rao.A case under sections 166 (whoever, being a public servant, knowingly disobeys any direction of the law), 166A (government official disobeying law) and 201 ( destroying evidence) of Indian Penal Code against the hospital staff and principal medical officer at Sanjay Gandhi Memorial Nagar police station on Saturday, the police said. Rao said they have handed over the investigation to crime investigation agency on Sunday and have asked to submit the report within 15 days.Raju Khan, brother of the deceased, said that his brother was stabbed to death by a rival group. He further said that the body was disappeared from the mortuary overnight. “When we reached the mortuary with investigating officer, initially they tried to mislead us and later informed us that they have cremated the body after being mistaken for Covid-19 death and started apologizing. The hospital staff told us that officials of the health department had taken the body for cremation,” he said.The police said that the body was mistaken for that of a coronavirus patient and handed over to the Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF) for cremation on Saturday morning. “We are conducting further investigations to confirm this,” said Rao.Yashpal Yadav, deputy commissioner, Faridabad, said that if any doctor or medical staff are found involved in the incident, strict action will be taken against them. “We are conducting investigation. The case has been handed over to the crime agency to investigate if any foul play is there in it,” he said. Notably, MCF comes under the office of deputy commissioner.Meanwhile, the police arrested four men in connection with the murder of Sonu on Saturday, said Rao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/murdered-man-cremated-as-covid-19-victim-in-faridabad/story-zfHKCBk8AZ2B71tbadFwcP.html
23-06-2020||Gurugram||RWAs in Gurugram unclear on norms for isolation centres||Even as the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and the district administration, over the last two weeks, have repeatedly encouraged RWAs in the city to set up isolation centres of their own, the lack of knowledge of the publication of prescribed guidelines has left the residents’ bodies in a lurch. The district administration, on Friday, formulated a set of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be followed and released it on select WhatsApp groups on late Sunday night. The absence of any proper media release or public notification regarding the same meant that several RWAs in the city were still unaware of their existence on Monday, when HT reached out to them regarding the matter. The district currently has 4,512 cases of Covid-19. Notably, the guidelines to be followed by the RWAs for establishing the isolation centres constitute a 19-page document, which is in possession of HT. Members of various RWAs (resident welfare associations) said they were procuring items for isolation centres and setting them up purely based on assumptions, and were uncertain about whether their facilities are appropriately equipped, even as cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) continue to rise in the city. In addition, the absence of clarity on who will foot the bills for the items and other facilities at the isolation centres for Covid-19 patients, and who will be held accountable in the event of any mishap in these centres has also added to the RWAs’ confusion.As many as 4,512 Covid-19 cases have reported in Gurugram so far.According to an estimate made by Vivek Kalia, nodal officer, hospital and ventilator management, if the number of cases increase to almost a lakh in August, the city would then require at least 37,000 beds and more than 2,000 ventilators.“The administration and the MCG are the ones who are on-ground and hence will know about all items that need to be stocked up in an isolation centre to ensure a Covid-19 is looked after properly. We have procured only those items for our own centre which we think are the most basic and essential. We weren’t aware of the administration’s SOP or else we would have arranged or procured any items that may have been left out before any resident needs this facility in our society,” said Puneet Goyal, president of Tulip Violet RWA.The RWA has reserved a four-bedroom vacant apartment as an isolation centre, which can accommodate eight people. The association, which has procured items such as— beds, masks, thermometers, a blood pressure monitor, a pulse oximeter, an oxygen cylinder, PPE kits, gloves, face shield, sanitisers—is also looking to identify one more apartment for the same purpose.Sudhir Sachdeva, a member of the Sushant Lok-1 RWA said although their governing body has started tying up with hotel chains and guest houses in their locality for setting up isolation centres, the uncertainty over the revenue model has had them scratching their heads. The RWAs has reserved at least 110 rooms for isolating residents in various hospitality centres so far.“There are a lot of issues on which the RWAs wants clarifications from the administration. Among them, the most important point is regarding the revenue model. We want to know from the SOP on who will bear the expenses for the isolation centre: will it be the administration themselves, the RWA or the person who will need to be isolated at the centre? We want clarity at the earliest so that we can arrange necessary funds for the same if the RWA has to bear partial or a significant amount of the total sum,” said Sachdeva.Another point of contention raised by RWAs was regarding accountability. “We are only building isolation centres in our respective areas as the administration has asked us to volunteer for it. However, we are not medical professionals. In the eventuality that a person dies inside the isolation centre or develops any health complications, we don’t want to be in a situation where we may face legal issues or our blamed for any mishap. The administration hence needs to issue the SOP and clarify who will be held accountable in such a scenario,” said Nilesh Tandon, president of Fresco Apartments RWA.All three RWAs said they were unaware of any official SOP issued by the administration.“We have released the SOP and have started circulating it in official WhatsApp groups where RWA representatives are also present. We have requested people to circulate it further,” said Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rwas-demand-clarity-on-norms-for-setting-up-isolation-centres/story-x8aqdtyOSTidnsM5cQ6DGJ.html
23-06-2020||Noida||Noida to create database of all non-coronavirus patients||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration has decided to prepare a database of all non-Covid patients, including senior citizens, across the district. The objective is to identify if they have Covid-19 symptoms and provide timely medical help, officials said.“We have asked all 300 small or big private and government hospitals to keep details of all those patients who come to them for treatment of ailments other than Covid-19. Our aim is to detect people with Covid-19 symptoms at an early stage, so that we can treat them on time and save lives. Also, we have asked residents’ welfare associations, apartment owners’ associations and other social groups to prepare data of non-Covid-19 patients in their respective areas,” said Narendra Bhooshan, who is nodal officer for Covid-19 preparations in GB Nagar.Bhooshan, who is also chief executive officer of Greater Noida authority, has interacted with office bearers of various social groups as to how they can help in fight with Covid-19 pandemic.“They can easily prepare a database of patients of non-Covid diseases and pass it on to us. We have set up a control room in Noida from where our teams will stay in touch with these patients and provide aid if need arises,” said Bhooshan.The administration has emphasized on collecting details of senior citizens who have ailments such as diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma, kidney problem and any cardiovascular disease.“Senior citizens who have non-Covid disease and have to visit a hospital are vulnerable to the infection. We need to take care of all of them. We are maintaining data of all of them with the help of social groups. Later, we plan to collect data from chemists too,” said the nodal officer. Residents’ bodies said that they had an interaction with the nodal officer about various issues related to Covid-19. “We have assured them of any help required in data collection. Apart from data collection, AOAs are ready to help the administration in handling the outbreak. We have appealed to AOAs to create a Covid-19 task force that will work in tandem with the health department teams,” said Rajiva Singh, president of Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA), an umbrella body of at least 70 housing societies’ apartment owners associations.“We will work together with the district administration for the safety of our residents. We have requested the administration to keep residents’ welfare associations of each sector in loop while taking decisions related with Covid-19 and measures to contain spread of the deadly virus,” said NP Singh, president of District Development Residents Welfare Association (DDRWA), which represents RWAs of GB Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gb-nagar-to-create-database-of-all-non-covid-patients-across-district/story-gqEPMu4u20seiZXaIpizqM.html
23-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad: 21-year-old TikTok ‘star’ arrested for killing woman days before her marriage||The Ghaziabad police on Monday arrested a 21-year-old man for allegedly killing a 19-year-old woman near Tila Morh in Sahibabad on June 17, days before the victim was supposed to get married. The police said the suspect is a ‘star’ on the content generation app TikTok with a following of over 4 lakh people.The suspect, identified as Sher Khan, was arrested with two alleged accomplices, Imran and Rizwan (single name), who were accused of sheltering Khan as he remained on the run since the murder. The police said on June 17, Khan had come with several other men on motorcycles to an area in Tila Morh where the victim was with her family and had a scuffle with her family members following which she sustained multiple stabbing wounds and succumbed to her injuries in a hospital in Delhi a day later.The police said Khan was a ‘stalker’ and killed the woman because she was getting married to someone else.“The man had been on the run since the day of murder and had been taking shelter in different parts of Delhi-NCR. The crime branch was also tracking him and eventually nabbed him in Sahibabad when he came to Ghaziabad. He told the police that he murdered the woman as he wanted to marry her, but she was getting married to someone else,” said Keshav Kumar, circle officer (Sahibabad). “The suspect had uploaded about 961 videos and has over four lakh followers on TikTok. During the period he was on the run, he had changed his dressing style and also had a hair cut to evade being arrested by police,” he added.The woman, Naina Kaur, was to leave for Indore with her family on June 22 for her marriage. After she was attacked, her mother Neelma Kaur had identified Sher Khan as the prime suspect in the complaint to the police. Khan had fled the crime scene along with his accomplices, police said. Naina, who lived with her family in Tulsi Niketan, was pursuing a nursing course from Delhi and had got engaged to a man from Indore. Upon complaint, the Tila Morh police lodged an FIR for murder against Khan, who is a resident Sundar Nagri in Delhi, and several of his accomplices. The added that soon after the murder, they had earlier arrested three more of the prime suspects’ accomplices— Salman, Asif, and Aamir.The police added that before the murder Khan had also prepared a video showing him holding a slate with words “Crime: murder” scribbled on it with his date of birth and other details. They added that in the video he portrayed himself as a Bollywood star who would break free from jail on a certain date and flee.The police also recovered a knife used in the murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-21-year-old-tik-tok-star-arrested-for-killing-woman-days-before-her-marriage/story-WunTwuQCviIjWSgRuhOQJJ.html
23-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt told to come up with fresh strategy for containment zones by Friday||The Delhi government on Monday issued an order which directed the district administration to come up with a revised plan for containment zones in the city by June 26 – an exercise for which the government has sought help of the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC).The order, issued by Dr Nutan Mundeja, the director general of health services in Delhi, on Monday asked the district administration to implement a “revised covid response plan”, which brings into effect a list of recommendations by Union home minister Amit Shah, who chaired a meeting on Covid-19 strategy on Sunday with Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal.In the meeting, Shah had recommended the Delhi government to come up with a fresh strategy for the containment zones by Monday – a date that was later modified in the order to June 26 – in light of the fact that over Friday and Saturday, Delhi accounted for around 24% of the total number of fresh cases and 25% of deaths in the country, senior government officials said.It was observed in the meeting that a fresh plan for containment zones was required since the city was reporting such a high number of cases. The home minister had also asked the Delhi government to set up district-level teams by Tuesday, to implement the fresh delineation exercise by Friday (June 26) and complete health survey of all individuals residing in containment zones by June 30. These dates find mention in Monday’s order without any change.“The divisional commissioner will prepare the plan in consultation with NCDC,” said a senior government official who did not want to be identified.NCDC is an institute for research on epidemiology and control of communicable diseases.The official further said, “District teams are ready for implementation of the new guidelines. The final plan will be ready by June 26 (Friday) and it will be implemented on the same day if needed. That way, we will not miss the deadline in terms of implementation. The deadline for the survey also remains unaffected. The order was drafted after consultation with members of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).”The DDMA is chaired by Baijal and the chief minister is the vice-chairman.As on Monday, Delhi had 261 containment zones – with the highest number of them in southwest Delhi (39) and the lowest in northeast Delhi (3).Earlier on Monday, suggestions were sought from the district magistrates in all 11 revenue districts of the Capital, and several of them have recommended that the strategy of fresh delineation should apply to the new containment zones and the existing ones should be left untouched for effective monitoring, said a second senior official who is privy to the details of a government meeting held on Monday.Jugal Kishore, head of community medicine department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “It is good that the government will consult the NCDC. The institute is better equipped with the knowledge of managing Covid cases. Containment zone demarcation strategy is a dynamic process and the requirements keep changing from time to time. The aim is to maintain an equilibrium between containing the disease by causing minimum inconvenience to people. This demands a scientific approach.”The director general of health services has also directed the Delhi government to strengthen district level surveillance teams and oversight system by roping in district commissioners of police, the commissioner of the concerned municipal body and epidemiologists registered with the government; to strengthen the surveillance and contact tracing activities; to use input of Aarogya Setu app and the Itihaas app, which was developed by the Union ministry of electronics and information technology.The government has been asked to conduct sero-survey of 20,000 individuals between June 27 and July 10 to gauge the burden of the disease; to engage civil society groups in the process and take adequate measures to protect transmission of Covid among healthcare workers. The district administration has been told to prepare a plan for house-to-house screening exercise to be conducted in the entire city (outside containment zones) by July 7. It also stated that cluster cases in highly dense areas will be sent to covid care centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-told-to-come-up-with-fresh-strategy-for-containment-zones-by-friday/story-2gKoE9gCQgc6hb5vHBBfUO.html
23-06-2020||Delhi||Doctors apprehensive about issuing ‘Covid-19 recovery’ certificates||Doctors have expressed reservations about issuing Covid-recovery certificates as mandated by the state government — the certificates state that a person “does not pose a risk to the community” — while discharging them from Covid-19 hospitals. The certificates,the Delhi government says, will help in countering the stigma that’s become attached to the disease. According to the June 15 order by the Delhi government, the certificate must mention, “This is to certify that I have examined …. He/She has recovered from Covid and does not pose a risk to the community. He/ She is asymptomatic at the time of discharge.”Under the Union health ministry’s discharge policy, those with mild to moderate symptoms can be discharged without testing after 10 days of symptoms appearing and/or being symptom free for three days.“How can a doctor certify whether a person is infectious or not without testing them? Although collective evidence from the cases, which have been treated so far, show that after 10 days the virus does not usually transmit the disease, but a microbiologist has to do a test in order to verify this,” said Dr Neeraj Gupta from the department of pulmonary medicine at Safdarjung Hospital.“In Delhi, we discharge asymptomatic and mild cases after their test reports come back and advice home isolation. Sometimes people are admitted for a couple of days and then advised home isolation. How can we give these people a certificate that states they are not a risk to the society?” asked Dr Mahesh Gupta, a city-based gastroenterologist .Even for those who stay at the hospital for longer, there is no way health care experts can determine whether or not patients will transmit the infection.“I can say a patient is free of symptoms at the time when he/she was examined. But, how can I say that they pose no risk to the society, especially when we are not even testing them at the time of discharge? The science on whether an asymptomatic person can transmit the infection is still unclear. Governments are going back and forth on what the ideal isolation or quarantine duration should be. In such a scenario, how can I issue such a certificate?” asked Delhi-based neurologist Dr Amit Shrivastav. “This is a legal document and doctors might be held liable in case even one of the discharged patients passes on the infection to their families or co-workers.”Issuing false medical certificate is an offence under the Delhi Medical Council Act, punishable by striking a doctor’s name from the state’s medical register and barring them from practicing medicine for a given period. “This is such a novel issue, there is no clarity on the rules about anything. However, if the doctors are following the government guidelines there shouldn’t be any reason for taking action against them,” said Dr Girish Tyagi, registrar, Delhi Medical Council. The government hoped that the certificate would reduce stigma against those who recovered from the disease. “People living in the same (housing) society and resident welfare associations become apprehensive, after a person living among or near them is discharged from the hospital. The certificate will help ease such situations,” Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director of Lok Nayak hospital, said on June 15 when the order was issued.Some officials also said that the certificate would help facilitate the rail and air travel of recovered patients. This is along the lines of immunity certificate, which the World Health Organisation warned against in April-end stating that there was no evidence to show that people who have recovered are protected from getting the infection a second time. Allowing immunity certificates for easing out of strict social distancing norms might fuel continued spread of the infection, WHO said then.Contacted, the Delhi government did not comment on the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/doctors-apprehensive-about-issuing-covid-19-recovery-certificates/story-tUT41Hk7VkDpTud3oA1yzK.html
23-06-2020||Delhi||Out of work, Delhi govt guest teachers selling fruits on cart, repairing bicycles to make ends meet||An English teacher is forced to sell vegetables on the road; a natural science teacher has set up a bicycle puncture repair shop; and a Sanskrit teacher has returned to his village to work on wheat fields. Many guest teachers working on a contractual basis in Delhi government schools and paid on a daily basis have been forced to find alternative livelihoods to make their ends meet after being rendered out of work for two-three months as schools remain closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic and amid little signs of them reopening in the immediate future.More than 20,000 guest teachers are employed in 1,030 government schools across Delhi. Paid between Rs 1,040 and Rs 1,400 per day, their contracts are renewed every year. They are not paid for Sundays, summer and winter vacations, or any national holiday. Some of them, though, do manage to find work even during summer vacation as teachers are engaged in summer camps and other activities. But the Covid-induced lockdown has made matters worse for them this year.On May 5, the Delhi government’s education department issued an order stating, “All guest teachers shall be paid up to May 8, 2020, and in summer vacation only if they are called for duties”. This time, however, no guest teacher has been called back to duty as schools are shut.Schools have been shut since March 19 in Delhi. Classes were shifted online and some guest teachers took part in virtual learning till May 8. The government declared summer vacations from May 11 to June 30 but online classes for classes 9 to 12 continued till May 28 and those who were taking part were paid on a daily basis till May 8.Then there are around 1000 teachers whose contracts were not extended after March 31 as they have not cleared the mandatory Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET). The test is generally conducted twice a year and next scheduled for July but this year there is uncertainty if it will be held due to the pandemic, forcing the teachers to stare at an uncertain future.Wazir Singh, 34 -- who was working at Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya in Sultanpuri H-block as an English teacher till May 8 – is an MA in English, and cleared BEd and the CTET. “We are being paid on a daily basis, due to which we are unable to save money. When our principal sent us a message on a WhatsApp group, saying we were relieved from duty till further orders, I had no savings. It was like a bolt from the blue. I am the sole earner for my family of five in Haryana’s Panipat,” he said.To feed his family, Singh hired a cart for Rs 2,000 per month and started selling fruits from 10 am to 6 pm near his rented one-room set in Sultanpuri last month. “I am earning Rs 400 to Rs 500 per day. I have to work to support my family. My father does not keep well and needs medicine. My three younger brothers are studying. I will continue to sell vegetables and fruits until the department calls me back. At least there will be some income,” he said.Among the non-CTET teachers who have been out of work since March 31 is Devesh Kumar, 40, who was teaching natural science at the government boys’ senior secondary school in Mehrauli. Kumar, who has done his BSc, MA and Bed, has set up a bicycle puncture repair shop near his rented accommodation in Ghaziabad. “I am the only earning member for the family of four -- parents, wife and a son. My son studies in class 3 at a private school. I could not pay his fee this academic session as I am out of work since April. I am repairing tyres to make our ends meet,” he said. Kumar, who runs a YouTube channel that imparts lessons on natural science, has been working with the Delhi government school since 2014.Ajay Veer Singh, general secretary of the government school teachers’ association, said many such guest teachers have been struggling to make ends meet amid the pandemic and the lockdown.“We have written to the education department and the education minister multiple times highlighting the plight of guest teachers. We had requested them to make some arrangements for the guest teachers during the lockdown since many of them are the only earning members. The government should also give some time to teachers to clear the CTET since it is expected to get postponed due to the prevailing situation,” he said. The next CTET is scheduled on July 5.Sanjeev Kumar, 34, a double MA in astronomy and Sanskrit from Banaras Hindu University, who has cleared the BEd, is out of work since March 31.Kumar was teaching Sanskrit at the government boys’ school in Nangloi before returning to his village in Himachal’s Bilaspur district in April. He has been working on his wheat fields since then. “I have not been paid since April even though I took online classes after the schools were shut. We don’t even have money to hire help for farming here. I’ve been working day and night to grow vegetables at home so that we do not need to spend on it. I have to support my wife and two kids,” he said. A senior DoE official, requesting anonymity, said, “Due to the prevailing situation government cannot accommodate so many teachers and pay them. These teachers will be called back when there is a requirement. There is enough time for them to clear CTET till then.”The Delhi government new norms make it mandatory for its teachers to qualify CTET, Binay Bhushan, director of education, said. “The guest teachers have never been paid during summer vacation. We will have to see if they are needed in July. We will call them back accordingly,” he said. Shoeb Rana, president of the all-India guest teachers’ association, said many guest teachers used to get work during the summer break at summer camps for Mission Buniyaad classes and remedial classes. “Around 70% guest teachers would be called for duty every year and were paid on a per-day basis. But this year, schools are shut and thousands of teachers are going through a tough time. There is uncertainty over the reopening of schools. Guest teachers will not get work until the schools reopen physically. The government should provide some assurance for our re-joining,” he said.Asked about the government’s plan to take back guest teachers, Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia said, “The matter is to be taken by the services department, which is under the Lieutenant-Governor of Delhi. Service matters are not discussed with us.”Despite several attempts, the L-G’s office did not respond to calls and texts sent for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/out-of-work-delhi-govt-guest-teachers-selling-fruits-on-cart-repairing-bicycles-to-make-ends-meet/story-iYL0YWV6Myr6eSXY7nvy3O.html
23-06-2020||Delhi||At Lok Nayak, patients’ families wait hours for update on their condition||Prabha Singh claims it took her three days to get an update on the status of her 63-year-old father who has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of Lok Nayak Hospital. “My father is a sugar patient and has severe breathing issues. All I need to know is whether a doctor is periodically checking on him and he is receiving medicines on time,” said Singh. On Monday, she was finally able to talk to a doctor treating her father after a person on the helpdesk called her from her father’s mobile phone and made the doctor speak to her. Singh’s experience isn’t unique. Despite a temporary helpdesk created to provide updates on the condition of patients, relatives of people admitted to the Covid wards of Lok Nayak say that it’s still very difficult to get one.Lok Nayak Hospital is Delhi’s biggest Covid hospital with 2,000 beds, of which 37% were occupied on Monday, according to data provided on the Delhi Corona mobile app. The 2,000 beds account for nearly 15% of all 13,377 beds currently available in Delhi’s hospitals. The hospital also has 64 ventilators, the maximum at any single Covid facility in Delhi. Over 78% of the ventilators at the hospital are under use.Rohit Kumar, said he had to wait for two hours before a security guard took him near the Covid ward where he handed over a bag of clothes for his 26-year-old sister, Rachna Verma, who has been admitted for 20 days.“I got a slip made at the helpdesk, but I couldn’t find the guard who was assigned to me,” Rohit Kumar said after finally meeting the guard and sending across the bag.A senior doctor serving in the Covid ward of the hospital said that while government doctors are trained to take on heavy case load and work for long hours, demands for updates from the relatives of patients are overwhelming. “The phone numbers of doctors are not shared with patients’ relatives, but we receive requests for updates from the coordination cell that caters to relatives,” added this doctor who asked not to be named. “But there are so many patients that it is not possible to repeatedly respond to each of their queries. Yet, we are doing all we can to inform them, and even help get across things they want to send to their patients,” said the doctor.A Delhi government spokesperson said that from Tuesday a “full-fledged” helpdesk will start operating from the hospital. “ From Tuesday, we’ll have a proper helpdesk where at least half-a-dozen people, from representatives of the chief minister to hospital doctors, will be stationed to cater to the queries of the kin of the patients.”The spokesperson added that a WhatsApp helpline number has been launched to cater to the relatives. On Monday, while posters of the WhatsApp helpline numbers were pasted near the helpdesk, relatives of many patients were seen waiting to collect slips from the temporary helpdesk so that they could either send across clothers or food, or have a word with the doctors.“We are doing our best under the current circumstances,” said a staff member at the desk, refusing to identify herself or speak any further. Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director (MD) of the hospital, said clothes are not allowed to be taken to the wards since there is a risk of them bringing infection. “We only allow eatables and water, etc brought by the family members.”As for the patients facing problem in speaking to their family members, he said most patients have their cell phones with them. “The problem occurs when they are on oxygen on ventilator support, which is true for most of our patients. We cannot remove the oxygen to allow the patients to talk to the family members.” The hospital MD said that with 10 tablets being pressed into service, relatives will be able to interact with their kin over video. “We have purchased ten tablets -- half of which will remain in the wards and the rest will be kept at the help desk. The relatives of the patients can come to the helpdesk for say two hours in the morning and two hours in the evening and communicate with them over video call. If successful, we will add the tablets to each ward,” said Dr Kumar.Many relatives said they frequently try the helpline numbers to receive an update on their kin. While some succeed, others said they often have to wait for hours to hear back.Nitin Kumar, whose 70-year-old father Hoshiyaar Singh, is in the hospital’s ICU, said the number is often busy, but admits that he does eventually get an update from the doctor. “They just tell me that he is stable and that he is eating well. In these times, that is all I want to hear.”  Pradeep Kumar, whose uncle is in the Covid ward of the same hospital, said he doesn’t receive a response despite waiting for hours.“I am told that I’ll receive a response in two minutes. That two minutes turn into two hours, but the response never arrives. My uncle has told me that there are two dozen wards, but only half-a-dozen doctors tending to them. So, I have decided to visit the hospital to directly seek response rather than dialling the helpline number.”Kumar requested staff at the helpdesk to give him a PPE kit and then take him to his uncle, but the staff turned his request down.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/at-lok-nayak-patients-families-wait-hours-for-update-on-their-condition/story-wjVKFcs0bh24BlD1eGWhcM.html
23-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh lags behind UTs in Covid-19 testing||A comparison of tests being conducted by all union territories (UTs) across India shows Chandigarh at the bottom of the list with the lowest number of Covid-19 tests. Among the UTs with a population of less than 15 lakh, Ladakh has conducted the maximum, with 43,816 tests per million and 837 positive cases till Sunday.Puducherry, with a population bracket similar to Chandigarh’s has conducted almost double the number of tests.Chandigarh, which is a major transit point for populations of at least three adjoining states is the only UT which has conducted less than 10,000 tests, averaging 68 tests a day, even though it’s close to the 100-day mark since the first case was reported here.‘Following ICMR guidelines’The UT health department has in its defence reiterated that tests are being done according to Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines. “Testing is as per the guidelines of the Indian Council of Medical Research and those fulfilling the criteria are being tested,” UT health secretary Arun Kumar Gupta had said recently.However, the poor testing rates have been criticised. “It’s beyond understanding why the testing numbers are being kept low, it should be made accessible to citizens” said Dr Neeraj Nagpal, convenor, Medico Action Legal Group.“This administration should understand that if the outbreak is not contained within the areas or clusters it can spread to the whole city. One possible solution is making testing accessible to all,” he added. Ramping up testing makes sense, says former PGIMER directorIn an ideal scenario where money is not a problem, as many people as possible should be tested, said Dr Yogesh Chawla, former director, Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER).“Till now symptomatic cases and their contacts are being tested but since the infection has spread, ideally we should test all keeping in view whether our resources permit it. But, its feasibility is an issue not only in India but abroad too. Still, we have some successful stories from South Korea and Taiwan. So, we should test as much as possible to stop the transmission,” Dr Chawla added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-lags-behind-uts-in-covid-19-testing/story-frumZ35NFFJJsv2zfUw5fJ.html

23-06-2020||Pune||Technical glitch affects Pune RTO work on first day of operation after lockdown||The Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO), which had been shut for three months due to the Covid-19 lockdown, resumed its operations on Monday. Learning and permanent licence tests along with other administrative services were offered to the residents. However, many had to wait for three hours for the learning licence tests due to technical problems at the transport office along with internet connectivity issues. Applicants who had reached the RTO at 10am, had to wait till 1pm when the tests began. “I work with a private company and had taken a half-day leave in order to appear for the learning licence test. When I came here at around 10am, I was told to wait as there was some system issue. However, I had to wait for three hours and at 12.30pm, the document verification, biometrics and other process started. I had to extend my leave to a full day due to the mismanagement of the RTO,” said Payal Sagale, an applicant.Sanjeev Bhor, deputy regional transport officer, said, “All the licence related works, tests and other administrative services were offered today (Monday). There was some technical internet connectivity issue due to which the learning licence tests were delayed. We resolved the issue and around 35 applicants appeared for the test today.”Another applicant Aryan Misal, a student, said, “If the RTO was planning to start the learning licence tests today, they should have made the arrangements for it before. During this pandemic, we need to reduce the amount of time we stay out of our homes and take necessary precautions. Such delays make us wait unnecessarily.”Meanwhile, other RTO-related works of transport and non-transport vehicles also started at the main office building at Pune RTO, Sangamwadi. However, common public was not allowed to enter the office premises and their applications and documents were submitted at the entry gate. Every person had to undergo thermal scanning and was given a sanitiser at the entrance gate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/technical-glitch-affects-pune-rto-work-on-first-day-of-operation-after-lockdown/story-JM443mjgm2wzp58QIaVDEL.html
23-06-2020||Delhi||Man arrested for duping Delhi Speaker on pretext of donating plasma||Delhi Police have arrested a 23-year-old man who allegedly duped Delhi assembly speaker Ram Niwas Goel and a friend on the pretext of donating blood plasma for the Covid-19 treatment of one of the friend’s family members.Police said the man targeted those looking for plasma donors on social media. He would claim to be a doctor who recently recovered from Covid-19, offer to donate blood plasma, and ask people for money to be transferred into his account for travel expenses. Once he got the money, he would be untraceable.The accused has been identified as Abdul Karim Rana, a resident of Pul Prahladpur in south-east Delhi, police said. The amount in the incident involving the Speaker was Rs 950.Police added that Rana confessed to cheating several people for petty cash using the same modus operandi soon after the national lockdown was imposed in March. “The forgery in terms of money may not be big, but the suffering that the patient had to face is what bothered us. When the man assured us that he will donate plasma, we were satisfied that we’ve got a donor, unaware of his real motives. I would advise people that they should be aware of such fraudsters and be extra cautious when dealing with such a situation,” Goel said.These days several people are looking for plasma donors for the treatment of their friends or family members, and “anyone manipulating such a situation in an illegal manner for his personal benefits, must face action”, he added.Goel filed a written complaint in the Civil Lines police station on June 20, detailing the sequence of events. “In his complaint, the Speaker said that his nephew had sought help in a social media post for the treatment of his father-in-law, and a person called Rahul Thakur contacted him. Thakur claimed that he was a doctor from Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) hospital, and told Goel’s nephew that he recently recovered from Covid-19. In the meantime, however, Goel’s nephew got another plasma donor,” said a police officer who asked not to be named.But, on June 19, when one of Goel’s friends was looking for a plasma donor for his father, who was admitted to a hospital in Gurugram, the name of Thakur, supposedly a doctor from RML, came up, the officer said. “When his nephew told him about Rahul Thakur, Goel contacted the man, who asked for Rs 450 as travel expenses to meet them in the hospital. The money was transferred to the account number given by Thakur,” the officer added.According to the police, Thakur later called Goel and said he did not receive the money, and had another Rs 500 transferred to his account by the friend. “After receiving Rs 950, Thakur could not be contacted,” the officer said.Deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj, said the details of the mobile phone numbers given by the accused showed that they belonged to Abdul Karim Rana, a native of Muzaffarnagar, who lived in south-east Delhi’s Pul Prahladpur. “His address was identified and he was arrested from his house,” Bhardwaj said. During interrogation, Rana said he made got fake identity cards made in the name of Rahul Thakur. Police said Rana’s bank accounts and mobile phone data were being examined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-arrested-for-duping-delhi-speaker-on-pretext-of-donating-plasma/story-xIce6OsgvMUIaXJo73xVBJ.html
23-06-2020||Pune||PMC to bear cost of Covid-19 tests in private labs||The spurt of Covid-19 cases in the city, 620 on Sunday, has moved the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to review its containment zones every seven days, instead of the current 15 days.The PMC has also decided to bear the costs of of all Covid-19 tests it commissions to private laboratories.According to municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, the Pune civic body has scheduled a meeting with the private labs to discuss bringing the costs of the tests down even further.“The Maharashtra government has fixed the cost of the Covid-19 test at Rs 2,200 for private labs. The PMC is planning to bring it down in Pune and has invited quotations from the labs. The PMC plans to bear the whole cost. A meeting for the same will take place on Tuesday,” said Gaikwad, who along with Pune divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar and district collector Naval Kishore Ram, held a joint press conference on Monday.The move will help the civic body increase its daily testing capacity by 500 samples, according to Gaikwad.Currently there is an average of 3,000 tests being conducted in Pune district daily, of which 1,500 to 2,000 take place in the city.The civic body has also changed its strategy for reviewing containment zones.“As per the existing policy, PMC is taking the review of containment zones every 15 days, but as the numbers are increase rapidly in non-containment zones, it has been decided to take a review every week. This way, we will announce new containment zones every week,” said Gaikwad.PMC also plans to restrict the entry for citizens at its headquarters, as more employees are testing positive.“I have given instructions to the security guard not to allow citizens into the headquarters. The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation has also banned visitors to its headquarters,” Gaikwad said.Migrants returningAccording to district collector Naval Kishore Ram, as many as 23,000 passengers de-boarded 144 trains passing through Pune, after the Centre started train services, partially.Of these 23,000 passengers, 8,963 have been identified as migrant workers returning to Pune.“As the city has started witnessing an influx of migrant workers, we have asked the labour department to keep a tab on labourers returning,” said Ram.Strict action for not wearing masksAction will be initiated in the city against the citizens not wearing masks,” said divisional commissioner Deepak Mhaisekar. Mhaisekar added, “The additional secretary has raised the same concern about the relaxation of citizens and instructed us to enforce mask wearing.”According to the divisional commissioner, the city police and the PMC will jointly start the drive in the city and impose the fine (Rs 500) against those not wearing a mask.District collector Naval Kishore Ram said, “It is a must to wear the mask. It is helpful for everyone and the government has asked citizens to wear masks. Despite making it mandatory, if the citizens are not using it, action needs to be taken.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-to-bear-cost-of-covid-19-tests-in-private-labs/story-rL3MFRsu1AmyrburL1mO2N.html

23-06-2020||Pune||Woman jumps off from fifth-floor hospital window in Pune||PUNE: A 36-year-old housewife on Monday morning jumped from the window of the fifth-floor room of a hospital, where her 13-year-old diabetic son was undergoing treatment, according to police.

23-06-2020||Pune||Four arrested for killing, burning, disposing of remains of 19-year-old in Pune||PUNE: Four men were remanded by a local court in Pimpri on Monday to police custody till June 25 for murder of a 19-year-old and destruction of evidence. The incident took place in March, but the murder came to light when the police were investigating a missing person case lodged by the parents of the deceased.The deceased was identified as Jasbeersingh alias Billu alias Vicky Gulzarsingh Virdhi (19), a resident of Milindnagar area along River road near Durga Mata Mandir in Pimpri.The arrested were identified as Niraj alias Dhosa Ashok Jangiyani (26), a resident of Pimpri Main Bazar area; Lalit Lalchand Thakur (21) Kamla Niwas in Pimpri; Yogesh alias Yogi Keshav Panjwani (31) Sanjay Library lane in Pimpri; and Harjotsingh Ranjitsingh Lohit (22) a resident of area near Vaishnav Devi temple in Pimpri, according to the police.“They all used to smoke marijuana together. The deceased and his elder brother had been in a fight with one of the accused hours before the murder. After that fight, the accused had lodged a complaint and a non-cognisable case was registered against the two Virdhi brothers that night. The fight was for a trivial reason,” said sub-inspector (PSI) DN Nikam of Pimpri police station who is investigating the case.Upon initial investigation, the four accused confessed to the crime. On March 7 at 11:30pm, the deceased and his brother, Sunny Virdi, had roughed up Jangiyani for reasons that are yet to be known. Jangiyani was hurt on his head. Enraged by the fight, at 12:30am on March 8, Lohit, who was at a paan stall located near Virdhi’s house, dragged the latter to a cowshed owned by Panjwani where the three others were waiting.On March 19, a missing person’s case was registered at Pimpri police station by Jasbeersingh’s mother Amreen Kaur Virdhi (34), who works as a domestic help and lived with the deceased.“The accused are habitual drug users. One of them has a history of drug possession case,” said inspector Rajendra Nikalje of Pimpri police station.According to the complaint, once they reached the cowshed, Jangiyani strangled Jasbeersingh while Thakur held his hands and Panjwani smashed the victim’s head with a stone. After the victim fell on the ground, one of the men hit him on the head again, causing his death. Lohit fled the spot when the three started hitting the 19-year-old.“The men sourced diesel and poured it on the body covered with dry grass, twigs, and dried cow dung from the cowshed, and burnt it. The body was half charred,” said PI Nikalje.The three men covered the remains with more dry grass and fled the spot only to return on the next day and wait until the pyre had cooled down, according to an official who is part of the investigation.“The exact number of days before they threw the body is still unclear,” said PSI Nikam.After the pyre had cooled down, the ashes were wrapped in a cloth and dropped in a river at Dapodi area. The police are trying to retrieve the remains and probing involvement of more people in the crime.A case under Sections 302 (murder), 201 (destruction of evidence) and 34 (common intention) of Indian Penal Code was registered at Pimpri police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/four-arrested-for-killing-burning-disposing-of-remains-of-19-year-old-in-pune/story-gnTkQwlV1erHYuz5sjnEvN.html
