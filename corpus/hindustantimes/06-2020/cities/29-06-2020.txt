29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Medical exams in Punjab to be held as scheduled: BFUHS V-C||A day after Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh announced postponement of examinations for the final-semester students in all universities of the state till July 15, the Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS) on Monday started theory examination for MD, MS, and postgraduate diploma courses. BFUHS vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur said the exams for the medical courses in state have not been postponed and the university will conduct the same as per the announced schedule. “There is confusion among the students but the CM has announced to postpone exams in the varsities accredited or affiliated to the University Grants Commission (UGC), while we are regulated by Medical Council of India (MCI), Dental Council of India (DCI) and Indian Nursing Council (INC). The UGC gives us grants only for research work,” he said.“We are conducting examination for medical, dental, super-specialty, specialty, nursing and physiotherapy courses as per the guidelines of the MCI, DCI and INC. The BFUHS have made all the appropriate arrangements to maintain social distancing. Keeping in view the safety of students, we have allowed them to opt for any of the designated exam centre near their hometown. Only the dental students who are not capable of clearing the exam are asking for postponement and seeking to upgrade them to the next semester, while none of the medical students have made such a demand,” he added.State medical education minister OP Soni said he is receiving a lot of calls from the students regarding the postponement of examinations. “I am looking into the matter. 400 students appear for exam at 5 centresOn Monday, more than 400 students of MD and MS courses appeared for examination at five centres. While the MBBS (first and second year) exams will begin on June 30, the third and final year exams of over 3,200 BDS and MDS students are scheduled to start from July 7.Amid the Covid-19 scare, the BDS and MDS students in 12 dental colleges of Punjab are demanding postponement of exams. Concerned over safety, they said they would have to face difficulty in reaching Punjab as many students belong to other states and there will be greater risk of getting infected while staying in hostels.After the CM’s announcement, the dental courses students took to social media to protest against the medical varsity to conduct semester examinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/medical-exams-in-punjab-to-be-held-as-scheduled-bfuhs-v-c/story-9eEzo10FPTucMJaqz91FcJ.html

The protests would also oppose deletion of lakhs of blue ration cards by the Congress government in state by keeping political considerations in mind.In a statement, SAD senior vice president and spokesman Daljit Singh Cheema said that during protests, the party leaders and workers will urge the Centre and the Punjab government to withdraw the hike imposed in prices of petrol and diesel.

29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Despite relaxations, buses run with 50% passengers in Ludhiana||Buses at the Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar Inter State Bus Terminal (ISBT) operated with 50% passenger load on Monday, two days after Punjab chief minister, Captain Amarinder Singh, announced lifting of restrictions on passenger capacity.With a notification awaited from the state department, operators have not been allowed to run at full capacity even though a few private services parking their vehicles outside the bus stand were seen taking a full load.ISBT, however, is reporting low footfall as people are staying away due to increasing Covid-19 cases in the state. Earlier, before lockdowns, buses would fill up in five minutes, “now we have to wait for 25 to 30 minutes,” says PEPSU Road Transport Corporation (PRTC) bus conductor Gurjeet Singh.Crowds had thinned out because of closure of schools and colleges, he added, and getting 50% passengers too was difficult, he said, adding “the transport sector has been hit badly due to the ongoing pandemic.” Earlier, about 2,500 buses departed from the station, now only 225 were operating, he added.Private bus operator Gurminder Singh said people like him were running a few buses because of low footfall. Interstate travel restrictions had taken a toll on the business, he added. “The state transport department has not issued the notification as yet for allowing bus operators to run the buses at full capacity. Also footfall is low at the bus stand with operators struggling to run at 50% capacity. Only inter district buses are being run and the operators have been directed to screen the passengers before they board the bus,” said station supervisor Kuljit Singh Sodhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/despite-relaxations-buses-run-with-50-passengers-in-ludhiana/story-jeVjfCQ0bXarRs1nBRnMAO.html

The party also said that it has identified 12 out of 243 seats in Bihar, where it intends to field candidates.Referring to the Jharkhand polls last year, JMM General Secretary Supriyo Bhattacharya said the Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) was allotted seven out of 81 assembly seats in the state, and one MLA, upon his victory, was also inducted in the cabinet.“We formally announce that the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM) will contest Bihar polls under (the banner of) ‘Mahagathbandhan’, which is headed by the RJD and has the Congress, Rashtriya Lok Samta Party, Hindustani Awam Morcha and the Vikassheel Inshan Party as allies,” Bhattacharya said.On the Election Commission freezing its symbol in Bihar during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections, he said the JMM has requested the poll panel to allow the party to contest this time with its ‘bow-arrow’ emblem.The poll body had derecognised the JMM’s symbol in Bihar last year, as it had similarities with JD(U)’s symbol.“We have identified 12 Bihar constituencies where we would want to nominate our candidates,” Bhattacharya added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jmm-to-contest-bihar-assembly-polls-under-mahagathbandan-banner/story-iPV3jk6O0ar49xZSbYvDwN.html
29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Cong leaders ride horse, bullock carts to protest fuel price hike||The Punjab, Haryana, Himachal and J&K units of the Congress on Monday held protest against the fuel price hike by the BJP-led Centre, with party leaders saying it is bound to have a cascading effect and burden the common people, including the farmers, who are already facing hardships due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar led the protests at Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar and slammed the Centre for raising the fuel prices repeatedly every few days despite the international crude oil prices remaining low. Jakhar along with MLA Angad Saini, Punjab Youth Congress chief Barinder Dhillon and other local leaders pulled a tractor with ropes.“When the Congress was in power in 2014, the price of crude oil was 104 dollars per barrel and the price of diesel was Rs 63 per litre. Now, crude oil is hardly 40 dollars per barrel but still the price of diesel has reached Rs 80,” he said, demanding an explanation from the Modi government. The 17-rupee difference between the rates during the Congress’ and Modi-government’s terms has put an additional burden of ₹7,000 on the farmers. The Modi government was fooling the farmers when it said that farmers’ income will be doubled.Similar protests were held in Amritsar, Sangrur, Patiala, Faridkot and Bathinda.The Haryana unit of the Congress too held statewide protests against the hike in fuel prices. Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja led the protest in Karnal, which is chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s home constituency. Several party workers rode bullock carts to protest against the hike in fuel prices.In Sonepat, Rohtak and Jhajjar, the protests were led by Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda. The Jammu and Kashmir Congress leader and former minister Raman Bhalla said, “The BJP government is fleecing people by imposing heavy taxes. A 20% hike on diesel and 258% on petrol is shocking,” he said. The Congress also protested against the rising prices of petrol and diesel in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh.Led by Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee general secretary Ajay Mahajan, the party leaders submitted a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind alleging that as the common masses are reeling due to Covid-19 outbreak, the BJP government was turning disaster into opportunity to make quick bucks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-leaders-ride-horse-bullock-carts-to-protest-fuel-price-hike/story-JthUouXcBqdaFxkAcBWuRI.html
29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 positivity rate in Haryana jumps from 2% to 5.6% in a month||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positivity rate in Haryana has risen from 2.01% as seen on June 1 to 5.56% on Monday, when 381 fresh cases were registered in the state and nine patients succumbed to the disease, health department’s data revealed. The national average is around 6.5%.Health experts say the rate of Covid-19 positivity is a significant factor that gives an insight into whether the tests in enough numbers are being conducted to detect the contagion. On June 1, the total number of samples Haryana health department had sent for examination till then was 1,21,779, while on June 29, the number stood at 2,60,341. Hence, Haryana in 29 days tested about 1,38,562 people. On an average, at least 5,000 fresh samples are sent everyday for testing in the state. On Monday, 7,985 samples were collected across Haryana. Dr Suraj Bhan Kamboj, director health services, Haryana, said the Covid-19 positivity rate is the ratio of positive cases to the number of tests conducted. “Undoubtedly, the Covid-19 positivity rate in Haryana is rising, but the fact is we have also increased the testing due to which more cases are being detected,” Dr Kamboj said.“There is no need to worry. The situation is better and well under control even as there is a surge in cases,” he added. Another positive factor in the battle against Covid-19, Dr Kamboj said, is that more than 50% cases in the state are either asymptomatic or showing mild symptoms. “In the beginning, we were sending samples to Pune, but now we have five government medical colleges and three district hospitals besides two labs in Hisar and Faridabad where samples are being tested,” he added.As per the data, on June 21, the state’s Covid-19 positivity rate was 5% and since then, it swiftly rose to 5.59% – the highest so far – on June 28 and dipped mildly to 5.56% on Monday. The recovery rate in the state, meanwhile, on June 1 was 44.78%, which by June 29 had risen to 66.87%. Also, the Covid-19 doubling rate has shown improvement as on Monday, it went up to 15 days after falling to an all-time low of six days on June 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-positivity-rate-in-haryana-jumps-from-2-to-5-6-in-a-month/story-M6spTj75GNU8XHx7EGbWCK.html

29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Khattar calls upon teachers to inspire students||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has called upon teachers to make valuable contributions in moulding the students as nation builders. Highlighting the importance of the role of teachers in self-reliant India, Khattar on Monday said the education should not remain confined to only basic school curriculum (reading, writing, and arithmetic). Instead, he said, the teachers should focus on the overall development of their students. “I am sure that in the discussion held today, we will get many ideas that help the students to become more cultured and self-reliant,” Khattar said while speaking at a webinar organised by the Haryana higher education council.He said the role of the teacher was “very important” in recognising the hidden skills and talents of the students and grooming them to become the nation builders. “The teachers should inspire the students. The role of any government is to build universities, colleges, and schools. It can make policies to bring reforms in the education sector, but the role of teachers in nation-building, shaping the future of their students and enlightening society is of paramount importance,” he said, pointing out that under the ‘Atam Nirbhar Bharat’ vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, education remains one of the focal areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/khattar-calls-upon-teachers-to-inspire-students/story-2tLNfYFFF3w3kZAgItMhdO.html
29-06-2020||Delhi||Now a Covid facility, Hindu Rao Hospital employees still grapple with basic issues||Non-functional air conditioning in wards, an inadequate doffing area and the non-availability of N-95 masks for health care workers are some problems the medical staff at the North Corporation-run Hindu Rao Hospital, which started operating as a Covid-19-dedicated facility on Saturday, are facing.Doctors and nurses said the emergency block that has been converted to a Covid-19 facility does not have functional ACs. They said wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) coveralls during 12-hour shifts, even with breaks, is suffocating and makes them dizzy.“We had met the hospital authorities on Saturday and they said they would resolve the issues by the first week of July. At present, three or four doctors have been put on rotating duty and are somehow managing, but this cannot be sustained when the number of Covid-19 patients in the ward increases,” Dr Abhimanyu Sardana, a senior resident and the president of the hospital’s resident doctors association (RDA), said.On Monday, the hospital had six Covid-19 patients, of which one is admitted to the ICU. The hospital, one of the biggest under the North Corporation, started operations with 50 beds for Covid-19 patients on Saturday, instead of the 200 announced on June 14 when the hospital was declared a Covid-dedicated facility. North Corporation mayor Jai Prakash, along with other officials, inspected the facility on Monday. “At present, we have logistics in place for 50 beds, so we started the process of admitting Covid-19 patients. Beds will be added in phases of 50 each and the number will go up to 200. We have decided to provide at least 50 beds with ventilator support. Right now, the hospital has 17 ventilators. We have roped in agencies under the corporate social responsibility (CSR) initiativeto provide us with ventilators to take the total number up to at least 50,” he said.The mayor said they were aware of the problems the staff was facing and had ordered 48 new air-conditioners while the old ones were being repaired. “We will install the new ACs by the first week of July,” he said.The staff on duty said that besides the doffing area for PPE kits not being adequate, health care workers in green and orange zones of the hospital such as corridors, nursing stations and the resting area have not been provided with N-95 masks, which is a must. This has caused a fear of infection among the staff.“The doffing area must be close to the Covid-19 ward so that the staff exiting the red zone can dump their kits without having to cross over to other areas. At present, we have to walk through the corridor to dump the kits. This could increase the chances of infection spreading to the orange and green zones,” a senior resident, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said.On Sunday, a 53-year-old housekeeping staff member of the hospital, Raju Singh Sonwal, died of Covid-19—the first Covid-19 death at the hospital after it was declared a Covid-19-only facility. So far, the hospital has reported two Covid-19 deaths. On June 19, a 56-year-old lab technician posted at the pathology lab here had succumbed to the virus. At least 76 staffers, including doctors, nurses, safai karmcharis and paramedics, have tested positive for Covid-19 at the hospital between April 25 and June 28.“There are issues with the dumping of PPE kits. Even when there were suspected patients in the isolation wards, there were similar issues and several staffers ended up testing positive. There is fear and anxiety of contracting the infection among the workers in such circumstances,” a nursing officer, who did not wish to be named, said. Reacting to this, Prakash said they have tied up with an NGO for providing their staff with around 1,000 N-95 masks. “The masks will reach the staff in a day or two,” he said, adding, “Also, we will be helping the family of Raju, who died fighting Covid-19, by appointing one of his children to the job so that the family is taken care of.”A senior North Corporation official, explaining the challenges in setting up of beds and doffing areas, said, “When we talk of a bed, it implies that other services such as specialist doctors, staff nurses, monitors, oxygen supply points, etc. too need to be made available for each of the Covid-only beds. Structural requirements such as separate donning-doffing areas, entry-exit points, dedicated operation theatres, etc. need to be created. To separate the Covid-19 area from the other buildings, we have started operations with 45 beds, five ICU beds and 84 isolation beds. We plan to add more as and when logistics and financial requirements are met.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/now-a-covid-facility-hindu-rao-hospital-employees-still-grapple-with-basic-issues/story-WBFFt4uuJuHEdglnS1cwPP.html
29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Congress protests against fuel hike||Up in arms against the recent fuel hike, Chandigarh Congress staged a protest against the central government in Sector 17 on Monday.Former Union minister Pawan Kumar Bansal and local party chief Pardeep Chhabra lashed out at the Narendra Modi government, saying it has “betrayed the trust of people” of India.Bansal said despite a sharp decrease in crude oil prices, petrol and diesel prices in the country have skyrocketed. “BJP leaders who used to create ruckus during the UPA regime, are now strangely silent and nowhere to be seen because they have no explanation for the rising fuel prices,” he said.Chhabra said crude oil prices during the UPA rule were almost 60% higher than they are today, but the Modi government is levying so many taxes that the public has to pay exorbitant prices as no benefit is being passed on to them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-congress-protests-against-fuel-hike/story-GNtMFKIKTnmXP0UGoRJQaJ.html
29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana Congress holds statewide protest against fuel price hike||The Haryana unit of the Congress on Monday held statewide protests against the hike in fuel prices, with party leaders saying it will put a burden the common people who are already facing hardships due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Haryana Congress president Kumari Selja led the protest in Karnal, which is chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar’s home constituency.Several party workers rode bullock carts to protest against the hike in fuel prices. They reached the mini-secretariat to submit a memorandum to the Karnal deputy commissioner demanding an immediate rollback in the fuel prices.Selja targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the NDA government at the Centre for increasing fuel prices despite a fall in the prices of crude oil.“Despite international crude oil prices being at their lowest, the Centre, instead of passing on the benefits to the common people by lowering the prices, is constantly hiking fuel prices,” Selja said.Accusing the government of charging hefty taxes on fuel she said, “We don’t want to talk about the ₹20 lakh crore economic package here but the government should tell us what have they done with ₹18 lakh crore revenue earned by imposing excise duty on fuel in the past six years.”In Sonepat, Rohtak and Jhajjar, the protests were led by Rajya Sabha member Deepender Hooda. “While the country is battling the Covid-19 pandemic, the central and state governments are increasing fuel prices. The hike in fuel prices at the time of cultivation has increased farmers’ expenditure,” the Rajya Sabha MP said.He also submitted memorandums addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the deputy commissioners of Rohtak, Sonepat and Jhajjar.In Ambala, Mullana MLA Varun Mullana said that he has been waiting for the BJP leaders to come out shirtless and join their protests, clearly hitting out at health minister Anil Vij whose shirtless pictures are currently doing the rounds on social media. Vij, an MLA from Ambala Cantonment had once led a nationwide protest against the UPA government due to inflation and rising fuel prices.SOCIAL DISTANCING GOES FOR A TOSSDefying social distancing and wearing of masks, Congress leaders Kumari Selja, Virender Rathore, Shamsher Gogi and others were seen glued to the bullock cart during the protest march. Since the gathering was also a violation of the Union Home Ministry’s guidelines, hundreds of party workers took out a protest rally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-congress-holds-statewide-protest-against-fuel-price-hike/story-297vcp09yHq858lxj7HVNL.html
29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Fall armyworm attack looms over maize crop||Punjab Agricultural University scientists have cautioned the farmers against fall armyworm attack on maize crop over 4 lakh acres in Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur, Ropar, Pathankot, Patiala and Fatehgarh Sahib districts. The invasive insect-pest was first spotted in Africa in 2016 and first time in India in 2018. Experts say the pest can destroy the crop completely if not controlled in time. Maize is already sown over at least 4 lakh acres in six districts of state and an addition of 2.5 lakh acres more is expected. “The pest attacks 10 to 40-day-old plant,” said PK Chhuneja, head department of entomology, Punjab Agricultural University (PAU). “It was spotted for the first time in Africa in 2016 and soon spread to 40 countries in the continent within a year. In India, the pest was first sighted in May 2018 in Karnataka, and within a year, it infested almost all the states. In Punjab, it was first spotted in August 2019 and damaged late sown fodder maize in various districts,” said Chhuneja.In an advisory, the PAU has urged farmers to complete sowing of maize by June 30 as rains help in reducing the pest load on the crop at its most susceptible stage. “Fodder maize sowing should be done by August 15. Fodder crop sown late, as experienced last year, has higher pest incidence,” said Chhuneja.“It caused huge damage to maize crop in Bihar last season. Its attack on maize crop is visible this time, but we are ready to deal with it,” said Punjab agriculture secretary KS Pannu. He advised farmers to be vigilant as the crop is currently at the most susceptible stage for the pest attack. He said the pest attacks only maize and there is no danger to any other crop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fall-armyworm-attack-looms-over-maize-crop/story-Cleg0R2Jd3Jis1JzLVFUSM.html
29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Cong workers protest in Ambala against fuel price rise||Workers of the Congress party on Monday protested in Ambala against the rising prices of petrol and diesel. The protest led by Mullana MLA Varun Mullana and Haryana Congress treasurer Rohit Jain was held near the Court Complex. Party workers rode a bullock cart and pulled a car with rope, symbolising how vehicles could not be used because of the rising fuel prices. Addressing the workers, Mullana said that he had been waiting for BJP leaders to come out shirtless and join their protests. He was clearly hinting at pictures of Haryana health minister Anil Vij in his younger days posing without a shirt that are currently doing the rounds on social media. Vij, an MLA from Ambala Cantonment, had once led a protest against inflation and rising fuel prices during the UPA government rule. Mullana and Jain also took a jibe at the popular slogan “Modi hai to mumkin hai (Everything’s possible if it’s Modi)” and compared the current prices with that of the UPA-2 government despite a sharp decline in international crude oil prices.Later, the workers handed over a memorandum to the deputy commissioner for the President of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-workers-protest-in-ambala-against-fuel-price-rise/story-xRj18vRO77cxMEH6NA7LbI.html

Even the routine maintenance works are going to suffer, he said.“There is also no chance of getting additional funds this fiscal as the Covid-19 outbreak has hit the revenues of both the UT administration and the central government,” said the MC chief.Though, he added, that certain works such as road carpeting, augmentation of water storage, street lighting and village development will be carried out as funds for these have already been separately allocated by the UT administration.MC HAS ONLY ₹581CR TO SPENDThe UT had approved a budget of ₹1,472 crore for the Chandigarh MC this year, of which, ₹1.072 crore was requested as grant-in-aid on the lines of the fourth Delhi finance commission. But the UT administration allocated grant-in-aid of ₹425 crore while the MC’s own revenue receipts were stated to be around ₹402 crore, taking the total funds available to ₹827 crore.However, in view of the Covid-19 outbreak, the MC revised its revenue estimates and brought it down to ₹321 crore. “Of this, around ₹20 crore has been set aside for the Covid fund, for which the Centre’s approval is required, and it is uncertain how it will be used. The MC gets ₹63 crore income from two petrol pumps, but, it fuel expense is ₹60 crore, so only ₹3 crore will be left. Consequently, the MC receipts stand at ₹241 crore, said Yadav.Earlier this month, the UT had also cut 20% from the ₹425 crore grant-in-aid in June and revised it to ₹340 crore. The 20% cut in expenditure was mandated by the central government in the wake of revenue loss on account of the Covid-19 lockdown.So, effectively, the Chandigarh MC is left with only ₹581 crore to spend.The MC has to pay ₹402 crore to its employees as salary, and ₹50 crore as employee pensions. In addition to it, around ₹120 crore is reserved for the MC’s electricity bill, and ₹25 crore as payments for petrol. Consequently, the civic body is left with a shortfall of ₹16 crore.BJP-CONGRESS BLAME GAMECongress councillor Devinder Singh Babla attacked the BJP from the onset of the meeting, stating that the BJP is solely responsible the MC’s financial mess. “The only solution to MC’s financial crunch is to remove BJP and bring Congress in control of the MC,” said Babla.In the midst of the heated exchange between councillors of both parties over Babla’s statement, BJP councillor and BJP’s city unit chief Arun Sood responded by listing some of the works done by the BJP, “29 MGD water has come, funds have been allocated for roads carpeting, dark spots, stray cattle management, and many other works. The financial mess is the legacy of the Congress’ mismanagement during its long rule in the MC. We are slowly rectifying it.”AGENDAS TAKEN UPIronically, even as the MC general house debated the financial crunch, the councillors rejected one revenue generation agenda in Monday’s meeting. The councillors said no to the MC proposal for renting the Mahila Bhawan in Sector 38. The MC was to rent out the first floor of the Bhawan for ₹2.5 lakh per month rent. The House, however, approved the agenda regarding display of advertisements on 55 public toilet blocks. Changes in current norms for allotment of some norms, such as giving allotment for five years rather than one year, was allowed. The agenda regarding waiving off license fee of kiosks till full lifting of lockdown at Night Food Street, Sector 14, was also approved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fiscal-deficit-chandigarh-mc-won-t-undertake-any-new-development-works-this-year/story-AG7GQXxqJsqTmisVyOlG3I.html

29-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt calls contempt plea over mismanagement of bodies ‘preposterous’||The Delhi government on Monday told the Delhi High Court that the city was facing a manpower shortage after four doctors succumbed to Covid-19 and thousands of healthcare professionals were infected. The government said that it was “preposterous” to move a contempt petition against it over the managing of bodies at such a time.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageAppearing for the Delhi government, Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain, told a bench of Chief Justice DN Patel and Justice Prateek Jalan that at a time when four doctors have succumbed to Covid-19 and thousands of healthcare workers have been infected, it was “unfortunate” and “preposterous” that a contempt plea had been moved even when the government is doing its best.The court was hearing a contempt plea moved by advocate Avadh Kaushik seeking action against the Delhi government and the medical director of Lok Nayak Hospital for allegedly not adhering to the undertaking given to the High Court with regard to handling bodies of Covid-19 victims. In his plea, Kaushik has alleged that bodies were lying in the same wards and corridors of the Lok Nayak Hospital where Covid-19 patients were admitted and kept.Additionally, the court was also hearing a plea which it had initiated itself on the piling of bodies at the hospital mortuaries and crematoriums. The court was hearing another matter by an NGO Mokshda Paryavaran Evam Van Suraksha Samiti through advocate Gaurav Bansal, offering its services of green cremations to the city.Advocate Akhil Mittal, the standing counsel of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, had, however, opposed the services and said that there would be confusion if this NGO was allowed to operate as there is already another NGO involved in the work.In a status report, the civic body also said that there is no piling or backlog of bodies and the work is going on smoothly.On Monday, ASG Jain told the court that the issue of body management is also pending before the Supreme Court, which had taken suo moto cognizance of the matter based on news reports. He said that the matter would be heard on July 20.Following this, the court posted the matter for July 29 for further hearing and said it would wait for the orders of the apex court in the matter before passing any direction or order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-calls-contempt-plea-over-mismanagement-of-bodies-preposterous/story-qBGI5GE1MMvuWKfml3CyvL.html

29-06-2020||Chandigarh||HC sets aside bail security of ₹100 crore imposed by Faridabad court||The Punjab and Haryana high court has set aside a bail bond condition of ₹100 crore imposed by a Faridabad court on a developer in a cheating case. The high court bench of justice Arun Monga termed the condition “unjust and unfair” and observed that the condition of bail should not be such which defeats the very meaning of bail. “Else, might as well decline the bail instead of giving an illusory one,” the bench observed.The court was hearing a bail plea of the promoter of SRS Group, Anil Jindal booked under Haryana Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishment Act, 2013 in March 2018 by Faridabad police in a cheating case of ₹2 lakh. Jindal was granted bail on March 27, but imposed with a condition of submitting security of ₹100 crore.He had told the court that he was behind bars since April 2018—more than 26 months. Were he to be held guilty post-trial, he already has undergone pre-trial custody equivalent to more than half (about 2/3rd) of the minimum sentence (36 months) against the offences he is suspected of. And in the appeal, he would have secured bail, but here he is in preventive custody. It was stated FIR is a result of the overall recession in the real estate sector.However, the state had argued that the amount of ₹100 crore security was justified as he had cheated a large number of people by collecting funds for about 300 companies. Further, there are 67 FIRs against him and his partners in 916 complaints and conditions have been imposed in view of these FIRs.The bench of justice Arun Monga observed that condition ought to have been determined to take into consideration the facts of this FIR with allegations though initially were of ₹2 lakh cheating now amount estimated at ₹2.75 crore due to more complaints.“Law permits curtailing the liberty of an individual suspect, but the purpose of using that power under the law is to prevent further harm to people at large in a civilised society, including the complainant(s). Liberty cannot thus be curtailed on grounds not envisaged in law or taking a rather tyrannical view on equity to impose undue conditions on liberty, as are incapable of compliance, as in the present case,” the bench observed.It added that when the accused had not pleaded for bail in all the FIRs, the court could not have taken into account other FIRs as those cases were not before it.The court, however, made it clear that this order pertains to one FIR only and he will have to apply for bail in other FIRs separately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hc-sets-aside-bail-security-of-100-crore-imposed-by-faridabad-court/story-CjJuu2rfwuWVibVIzqFZVM.html

Speaking on the topic ‘Resurrection of Punjab’ as part of the live #SpeakUpIndia NRI series being facilitated by the Indian Overseas Congress (IOC), the cricketer-turned-politician said, “I cannot be a silent spectator to the present condition of Punjab. For the last 25 years, the system has failed us.”Though he did not name anyone, the Congress has assumed power in the state twice (2002 and 2017) under the leadership of Captain Amarinder Singh in the last 25 years.“Hukamranan ne Punjab nu girvi dhar ditta. Punjab de haq maar k apne pet bhare gae, jis karke ye dubda chala gaya” (The rulers have mortgaged Punjab. Compromising with the rights of Punjab, they filled their own pockets and this is the reason it went on sinking).“Revenue from the state exchequer is going to private pockets. The power of people must return to people. Only 1% people are beneficiaries of this set-up while the rest continue to suffer,” he said in a 40-minute speech which was followed by a question-answer session.IOC president Mohinder Singh Gilzian, vice president Ravi Chopra and others gave the credit of the Kartarpur corridor opening to Sidhu. Satish Sharma, chairman of the IOC’s US chapter, told Sidhu, “We are happy to see you here. I would like to convey the message of Punjabis living in the US that everyone wants to see you as Punjab CM.”Sidhu also advocated setting up of NRI centres for encouraging those settled abroad to make investments in the country. He also called for establishing a tribunal to protect their interests and deal with the disputes related to their businesses and land.Among those who attended the session were IOC office-bearers from countries like the US, Canada, Australia besides Europe and the Gulf. Also, one-minute silence was observed in the memory of 20 Indian soldiers recently killed in the India-China faceoff at Ladakh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/successive-govts-mortgaged-punjab-says-sidhu-in-his-diaspora-address/story-XVpzOiaM1iTAqfDapZ2TuN.html

To start with, a mobile van of the municipal corporation (MC) started collecting samples in the city’s two containment and as many micro- containment zones. Thereafter, more such vans may be pressed into service in other areas, health officials said. “The residents of containment zones were reluctant to visit the nearby sample collection centres thinking that they might get infected if they came in contact with others. Due to this, the health department was unable to achieve the target of random sample collection in the city’s two containment zones. Two teams of doctors will be sent in the van at one time,” said assistant civil surgeon Dr Amarjit Singh.Amritsar mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu said, “This is the first initiative in Punjab to launch a door-to-door sample collection facility.

The commission said the number of crimes being reported against women on the helpline reduced for a while but picked up again after the lockdown was lifted. “Majority of the callers asked about lockdown rules, distribution of food and interstate movement. The commission received more than 20,000 such calls and provided assistance to the complainants,” said a statement issued by the commission on Monday. It added that fewer crimes against women were reported this year compared to the corresponding period last year. “For instance, domestic violence complaints for the period March to June in 2019 were 8188. Last year, during the same duration, 6909 cases were reported,” it said. DCW chief Swati Maliwal said, “The reporting of cases had decreased during the initial days of the lockdown. It has also been observed that the reporting of crimes also decreased during the lockdown when compared to the similar period last year. The commission has taken several measures to create awareness for better reporting of crimes against women. Such calls have started increasing now with the gradual reopening of the city.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/women-s-panel-got-20-000-lockdown-related-calls/story-WjcURFnUTyiakiqTGpn3GJ.html

It said the community is praying for permission to immediately shift the 65 foreign nationals from Meeraj International School to Texan Public School in Maujpur, a new accommodation suggested by them.The high court had on May 28 disposed of two petitions filed by different foreign nationals seeking to be shifted to alternative accommodation and stating that the financial burden will be borne by the community, Tablighi Jamaat. It warned that they should not shift to any other location without Delhi Police’s permission.The Delhi police had in March registered a case against th top management of Tabhighi Jamaat for allegedly defying government orders to contain the spread of Covid-19.

SC tells Centre to explain||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Monday asked the Centre to explain by Thursday if the visas issued to nearly 2,500 foreigners who had attended a congregation at the Tablighi Jamaat Markaz in Nizamuddin were revoked, why they were not deported yet. The court observed that the ministry of home affairs had blacklisted these 2500 foreigners yet they were allowed to “linger on in India”, stressing that it wants to see the official order against the Jamaat attendees. The Delhi Police have submitted charge sheets against 900 Tablighi Jamaat members, which also includes foreigners, accused them of allegedly attending the religious congregation organised in March by the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters, in violation of their visa conditions and the Indian government’s guidelines on the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.A three-judge vacation bench of Justices AM Khanwilkar, Dinesh Maheshwari and Sanjiv Khanna wished to know if the action against these individuals were based on a press release of April 2 and June 4 or whether specific orders were issued to the affected individuals. Senior advocates Chandra Uday Singh and Salman Khurshid informed the Court that the blacklisted foreign nationals want to return home but were unable to do so as FIRs have been registered consequent to which their passports were impounded by the local police.With solicitor general Tushar Mehta in attendance through videoconferencing, the bench observed, “We want to know if their visas have been cancelled, why they have not been extradited. Why are they still here? On this ground alone we can throw out these petitions.”Mehta sought a week’s time but the court directed the matter to be listed on Thursday. The bench told the petitioners that the court cannot proceed on basis of a press release and wished to see the specific orders cancelling the visas.The petitioners before the Court hail from Indonesia, China, Malaysia, Thailand, Fiji, Jordan, Sudan, Tanzania, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Kenya, Mali, Morocco and Tunisia. Many among them were released from quarantine in May but were later housed in facilities with restricted movement.Advocate Fuzail Ahmed Ayyubi who drafted the petitions for these foreigners said that the Constitutional right under Article 21 is available even to non-citizens and such right cannot be withdrawn unilaterally by the government without hearing them. The petitions stated that visa guidelines do not restrict visiting religious places or attending religious events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/why-were-blacklisted-tablighi-jamaat-members-not-deported-sc-tells-centre-to-explain/story-tO83hMKZWvFEHFC0viR7bP.html
29-06-2020||City||HC stays Delhi govt’s move to reserve 50% seats at National Law University||New Delhi: The Delhi High Court on Monday stayed the move by the Delhi government to introduce 50% reservation at National Law University, Delhi for students who have passed their qualifying exams in college or institutions located in the city while stating that it was not justified of the University to bypass the governing council and proceed to reserve seats on the strength of the decision of the vice-chancellor of the university.The Court said that it appeared that NLU, Delhi succumbed to the pressure by the Delhi government without waiting for the recommendations of the committee constituted by the governing council. It said that once the governing council had decided to constitute a committee to look into the procedure that may be followed on the issue of providing reservation for candidates clearing the qualifying examination from institutes situated in Delhi, there was no occasion to side step the committee and the vice-chancellor could not have decided the issue without approaching the governing council for appropriate sanctions.The governing council is the plenary authority in the University which formulates and reviews from time to time, the broad policies and programmes of University. The council is the supreme authority of the university comprising of the chancellor (the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court), the vice-chancellor, who is appointed under the NLU Act. It also comprises of several other members including two sitting Judges of Delhi High Court, chief secretary of Delhi government and chairman of the Bar Council of Delhi.In an interim order, a bench of Justice Hima Kohli and Justice Subramonium Prasad said that the decision for providing horizontal reservation has been taken by the NLU, Delhi in haste without acting in accordance with the NLU Act.It directed the NLU, Delhi to issue fresh admission notification before 2nd July and is also directed to publish it on its website. The main matter would be heard on August 18.The court’s interim judgment comes while hearing a plea by the students of the varsity challenging the decision of the NLU of reserving 50% seats for the students who have passed their qualifying exams in college or institutions in the city.“We are of the opinion that if the impugned notification is not stayed, grave prejudice would be caused to the students who would be applying for admission in the NLU, Delhi for the academic year 2020-21. In fact, staying the operation of the impugned notification insofar as horizontal reservation of seats for students belonging to Delhi has been provided for the academic year 2020-21, would result in inviting a larger section of students,” the bench said.The court also said that the Governing Council had constituted a Committee under the Chairmanship of Justice NV Ramana, Judge, Supreme Court, which included Chief Secretary, Delhi government and Secretary, Higher Education, Government of Delhi and the Registrar, NLU, Delhi. It said that this Committee was to examine the entire issue and forward its recommendations to the Governing Council.The bench said, that however nothing is placed on record to demonstrate that any recommendation was placed before the Governing Council, which is the only body is constituted to take decisions on all important matters relating to the University and its functioning.“Status quo ante as of the previous academic year shall be maintained for making admissions to the BA LL.B (Five Year Programme) and LL.M (One Year Programme) in NLU, Delhi, for the academic year 2020-21. NLU is directed to issue a public notice on or before July 2, informing the public at large about the decision taken above and granting a further period of one week from the date of issuance of public notice to enable interested candidates to submit their applications for admission.“The redrawn schedule will not interfere with the entrance examinations that are to take place in August 2020 The order passed shall also be uploaded on the website of the NLU, Delhi forthwith,” the bench said in a 23-page judgment.Appearing for the petitioners, senior advocate Neeraj Kishan Kaul and advocate Nipun Saxena, told the court that varsity’s move was unconstitutional since providing 22% reservation to OBC and 10% reservation to EWS category without increasing the total number is against the mandate of guidelines issued by Ministry of Human Resource and Development (MHRD).Ramesh Singh, Delhi government standing counsel, had contended that the decision to introduce reservation contended that NLU Delhi is not a Central institute of excellence and it is only a state university that came into existence on the basis of the Act enacted by the Delhi legislature. It was also contended that no student who intends to apply for admission in NLU, Delhi has challenged the notification or the admission prospectus and the reservation which is being extended to regional students will not prejudice the interests of the petitioners and, therefore, the said petition should be dismissed on the ground of maintainability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hc-stays-delhi-govt-s-move-to-reserve-50-seats-at-national-law-university/story-bVQ7iXG8Nv9SETNZk4JbDP.html
29-06-2020||City||BJP alleges discoms sending inflated bills||New Delhi: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Monday alleged that the discoms had sent huge power bills to both residential and commercial units for the lockdown period and demanded the Aam Aadmi Party government waive off fixed charges for commercial connections.Dellhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta there are complaints from RWAs and commercial units regarding provisional bills being sent by the discoms. The BJP said that instead of provisional bills, the government should direct discoms to send actual bills to people.Gupta said while the AAP government had made a budgetary provision of Rs 2,820 crore for subsidy, it was not reaching people. “The discoms were unable to conduct meter reading during the lockdown, but consumers received electricity bills for almost 94 days. In these bills, consumption is shown per month, but in the month where the consumption is less than 200 and 400 units, subsidy was not provided to the consumers,” Gupta said.Commercial establishments, especially small and big industries, were closed during lockdown but they have been charged huge bills along with fixed charges, the BJP said.“Almost two lakh small and big industries and seven lakh shops and offices were closed in lockdown. But still they were sent huge electricity bills and are being asked to pay fixed charges. We want the benefit of subsidy to be given to consumers and the fixed charge in electricity bills of commercial places should be removed with immediate effect,” said Gupta.A Delhi government spokesperson said, “There has been no increase in our policy or the subsidy we provide. If there are any specific cases, we will absolutely look into it and make sure the discoms fix any discrepancy that may have caused it. The BJP is always free to send details to the government about such discrepancies, and we will immediately act on it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bjp-alleges-discoms-sending-inflated-bills/story-IUQoddU5lCH0GyS6H8qebO.html

He said that since a large number of people from Kharar and nearby villages visit Morinda or Chandigarh University, Gharuan, on a daily basis, the people staying within 5-km radius of the toll barrier should be exempt from paying the fee.“The fee is hefty (₹65 per visit – one way), and those travelling to Ludhiana and back on the road are paying as much as ₹260 per trip,” Sandhu said.The MLA added that he has taken up the matter with Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan who said he would take it up with NHAI authorities. He added he will raise the issue in the forthcoming Vidhan Sabha session.MLA Sandhu pitches for war memorial in KhararSandhu demanded that a war memorial-cum-public park be constructed on the vacant 15-acre defence land opposite the church on Kharar-Mohali road.Speaking to the media, the MLA said he has written to Lt General RP Singh, general officer commanding in chief, Western Army Command, and district authorities in this regard.The letter says that flag hoisting on Army Day and other days of national importance can be observed at the proposed war memorial. “Names of all soldiers from Kharar who were killed in action can be inscribed on a plaque at the proposed war memorial,” Sandhu said. He suggested that the entire plot should be fenced, or a boundary wall be constructed around it, and besides the war memorial, a public park should come up on it. “The maintenance of the plot could be entrusted to the Kharar civic body under the supervision of the nearest Army sub-area. This will ensure proper utilisation of the land and benefit the people of Kharar,” the MLA added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kharar-mla-opposes-high-toll-rates-of-khanpur-toll-plaza/story-VrH5oEwV57ONIFpzLrbLbP.html

The Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) had initiated demolition of two vacant extremely dangerous building in its vicinity. The UMC has listed 30 buildings as extremely dangerous and 118 building as dangerous this year. Notices are sent to the residents of these buildings to vacate them.The civic body has initiated the demolition of two buildings, Ambika Sagar apartment at Camp-3 and Shanti Palace apartment at Camp-2. 25 families of Ambika Sagar went homeless after the incident.Moti Jagwani, 59, who lived in the Ambika Sagar apartment and now living at his relatives place said, “In May the civic body posted a notice on the building asking to demolish the structure in seven days or they will demolish it. We are homeless since after the incident and how can we arrange for the demolition of the building during the lockdown. The civic body never spoke about our rehabilitation and now they are razing the structure.” A three-year-boy had died and his grandmother was injured after a ceiling of this apartment had collapsed on July 27,2019.Another building Roop sagar, located in Ulhasnagar 3 in which six families reside and also three shops operate recently got a notice from the civic body asking to either repair or vacate the building.“At this point of time how can the civic body ask the residents to vacate or carry out the repair works of the building? The families in the building are clueless and are living in fear,” said Indar Varliyani, a resident of Roop Sagar apartment.“We have now found the contractor and hence initiated the work. Meanwhile other buildings which are in the list have been served with notice asking the residents and owners to vacate and demolish it voluntarily, “said Shimpi.Social activist from Ulhasnagar Sashikant Dayma said, “Serving notices to the residents and asking them to demolish the structure and vacate during the lockdown period is it not acceptable.

29-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi University admissions: Fewer applications under sports quota; officials cite difficulties in getting certificates issued||Delhi University till Monday — five days before its registration process for admissions to various undergraduate course closes — had received only a handful of applications under the sports quota.While some officials cited difficulties in procuring merit or participation certificates amid the Covid-19 pandemic as a reason behind the drop in applications, others added that a change in criteria for admission under the sports quota has also discouraged aspirants.In view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Delhi University this year has decided to skip the trials that are held for admissions under the sports quota. The candidates will be given admissions based on their merit and participation certificates only. In DU colleges, 5% supernumerary seats are reserved under sports and extracurricular activities (ECA) categories collectively in each course. This year, the university has decided to scrap admissions under ECA categories, excluding NSS and NCC, owing to the prevailing situation.According to data shared by the university’s admission branch, the number of applications received this year from aspirants opting for popular sports, such as athletics, football, basketball and cricket, is not even 30% of what it was last year, as of Sunday. For instance, the overall number of applications received under the sports quota from aspirants choosing football was 1,578 last year. However, only 317 applicants have applied under the discipline this year till Sunday evening. Similarly, the number of applications in athletics, basketball, cricket and volleyball stood low at 360, 344, 248 and 227 respectively, till now. Last year, the number of applications in these disciplines were 1,297, 1,223, 1,001 and 940, respectively.Pankaj Sinha, a member of the DU’s sports council, said that candidates are facing difficulties in getting their participation and merit certificates issued. These certificates are to be uploaded along with the applications. “The offices of schools, universities, federations and sports academies are closed for more than two months in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. Due to this students have not been able to get their merit and participation certificates issued. This is a major reason as to why many could not apply to DU as of now. It’s mandatory for the candidates to upload certificates with their applications. We do not allow letter heads or any slips. We are sure that the number of applications will increase in the next few days,” he said.Sinha said that around 700 students seeking admissions in postgraduate courses under the sports quota have also applied for the issuance of their certificates from the University’s council itself. “We have received many applications from the candidates requesting to extend the dates of registration so that they can get some more time to get their sports certificates issued,” he said.Several sports teachers in colleges across the University said that the changes in the criteria this year can also be a reason behind low applications. Mukesh Agrawal, assistant professor in physical education in Maharaja Agrasen College, said, “Every year we get so many students who either did not get opportunities to play above the zonal level or avoided participation in competition in order to focus on their studies after class 10. Many students last year did not have winning certificates but they performed well in the trials. This year, these students will get affected. Many students might not apply in the category thinking they won’t get admission.”For applying under the sports quota, candidates have to submit merit or participation certificates of the preceding three years. This year the certificates dated May 1, 2017, to April 30, 2020, will be applicable. Himanshu Panwar, 18, a resident of Haryana’s Hisar district, said that the latest certificate he has was for the year 2018. “My parents did not allow me to participate in competitions after class 10 and that’s why my last win was at the state-level in Judo in the year 2018. I was banking on the trials since they carried 60 marks till last year. There are no trials now. I am still thinking about what to do,” he said.Benu Gupta, associate professor in Physical Education at Kirori Mal College, said, “It’s possible that the students are unable to procure original certificates of the tournaments that had happened immediately before the lockdown was announced. In such cases, the administration should consider the letters issued by the concerned authorities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-university-admissions-fewer-applications-under-sports-quota-officials-cite-difficulties-in-getting-certificates-issued/story-epjdctxV4yCsVZTUR5ZU4I.html

Whenever the RJD asks me to join, I will,” said the former LJP leader, who was elected to the Bihar Assembly five times before being elected MP from Vaishali in 2014, where he trounced RJD veteran and five-term MP Raghuvansh.Earlier this month, Rama Singh, who had quit LJP in 2019 after being denied a ticket for the Lok Sabha election, had met RJD leader Tejaswhi Prasad Yadav and before that Lalu Prasad in Ranchi. A few days ago, he even announced his imminent induction into the RJD, following which Raghuvansh Prasad shot off his resignation letter. Both Rama Singh and Raghuvansh Prasad are Rajputs with sizeable influence in the community.While Tejashwi was not available for comment, RJD spokesman Chitranjan Gagan said Rama Singh’s induction was put on hold for the time being. ‘Raghuvansh Babu is our guardian and our entire focus is on his recovery. Today, we have got news that he has tested negative. After five days, there will be another test. Any decision regarding Rama Singh will be taken by the party high command,” he said.Rahuvansh Prasad, who was down with Covid-19, has recovered, though he will remain in hospital for another few days. He was admitted to AIIMS-Patna after testing positive on June 17.Last week, five RJD MLCs had left the party and joined the JD-U the same day Raghuvansh Praasad Singh resigned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/raghuvansh-sulking-rjd-puts-rama-singh-s-entry-on-hold/story-vCGMHMA6XUVb9qQB9l5nuL.html

He said the number of ‘saroops’ damaged in the blaze and due to water in fire control operation was 80 and the SGPC officials hid this truth. “The record of remaining 187 saroops was taken away from me by the SGPC officials. They did so to hide the 2016 incident,” he said.“Apart from forcibly getting an affidavit from me, the SGPC officials continue to harass me to make me keep my mouth shut. I want a case registered against the SGPC officials and a free and fair inquiry. I have evidence and will produce them before the inquiry officer,” said the complainant.On the other hand, the SGPC has termed the accusations as “misleading” and “condemnable”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/missing-saroops-ex-employee-files-police-complaint-against-sgpc-officials/story-q5kt5vPwszymHq6MSELaYN.html
29-06-2020||Bangalore||Stricter measures likely after July 7 to control Covid-19 spread in Karnataka||Karnataka Revenue Minister R Ashoka on Monday indicated that more stringent rules are likely to be put in place after July 7 to control the spread of Covid-19 in the city and other parts of the state, amid spike in cases.According to reports, the government was waiting for SSLC (class 10) exams to end on July 4 to take some stringent measures to control the infections. “For everything, I think you will have to wait till July 7 in the interest of the children.After July 7 Chief Minister will take decision to bring in several changes,” Ashoka said in response to a question about imposing restrictions like on inter-state travel, among others, amid increase in cases. The minister, who is also in-charge for Covid management in Bengaluru, said according to reports from experts in July and August cases will increase the world over, in India and similarly in the state and Bengaluru also, and in this regard, precautionary measures will be taken.Following the recent spike in cases, there was speculation last week that the government may reimpose lockdown and few ministers had even indicated about this, but the government subsequently ruled out any such measure stating that improving state’s economy and carrying out developmental activities were equally important.Karnataka on Sunday recorded a biggest single-day spike of over 1,200 new Covid-19 cases and 16 related fatalities, taking the total number of infections in the state to 13,190 and the death toll to 207.Out of 1,267 fresh cases reported in the state yesterday, 783 cases were from Bengaluru urban alone.The city also tops the list of districts with positive cases in the state, with 3,314 infections.Ashoka said he has visited dedicated Covid hospitals in the city, including Victoria Hospital, and has requested the Doctors and medical staff there to be mentally prepared to continue to work in the same way they are doing now for about six more months.He said the challenge before the government is making beds available for an increasing number of patients and providing them treatment. “All necessary measures are being taken in this regard.”In response to a question, he said both spread of virus and increase in testing has led to surge in number of cases getting reported.Noting that till now private testing centres used to directly inform the patients in case one tests positive, Ashoka said directions have been given asking them to first upload the information on BBMP (city civic body) and ICMR portals and the authorities will inform the patients along with instructions about what they should be doing next.“This is to ensure that patients don’t panic and don’t directly come to hospitals...health officers at ward level on getting the information will go to the patient, check whether they are symptomatic or not. If symptomatic, they will be sent to a designated hospital and those asymptomatic will be sent to Covid Care Centres,” he said.This will also ensure that there is no delay or hassle for patients during the process, he added. Noting that there are complaints about doctors at dedicated hospitals not visiting patients regularly and it is difficult to track with all staff there wearing PPE kits, Ashoka said “We have given instructions for doctors and staff to wear stickers and to maintain duty register.” He also said, beds are being numbered at Covid wards and will be linked to patient number, so it can be identified easily whenever they are vacant and new patients can be assigned to it easily.Pointing out that staff working at hospitals like lift operators, ambulance drivers, cleaning staff are working with apprehensions and some are even applying for leave, Ashoka said he has spoken to the Chief Minister and Chief Secretary to incentivize them in some way by increasing payment and encourage them to continue with the work. “It has also come to my notice about the quality of food being provided to patients at some hospitals,” he said, adding, measures will be taken to provide quality food.About 85 assistant doctors will be appointed on contract basis in BBMP limits in about three days and all are AYUSH and dental doctors and will work under the supervision of senior doctors, the minister said.A meeting of BBMP corporators belonging to all political parties will be called soon, Ashoka said. Keeping social distancing in mind, the meeting will be called in three batches, regarding managing the sealed areas in their wards.In every ward, NGOs will be identified and they will be tasked with assisting in sealing activities, shifting of patients to hospitals and creating awareness, among other things, he said.The minister said out of Rs 742 crore SDRF (State disaster response fund) with the department, Rs 380 crore has been released for Covid management, which includes- Rs 232 crore released to Deputy Commissioners of districts, Rs 70 crore for health department, Rs 50 crore for BBMP, Rs 12 crore for Home Department. A sum of Rs 362 crore is still available with the department, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/stricter-measures-likely-after-july-7-to-control-covid-19-spread-in-karnataka/story-15oqMkZXHV9bRakcwE3trO.html

The study, named ‘Rapid Online Perception Study about the effects of Covid-19 on children’, was conducted during the first and second phases of lockdown based on responses of parents/primary caregivers from all across the country, including Jammu and Kashmir.A total of 387 respondents from Jammu and Kashmir participated in the survey.Explaining the relevance and imperativeness of the study, Soha Moitra, regional director, CRY (North) said, “As immunisation programmes witnessed a major setback during the lockdown across the country, the results of the survey across 23 states and Union territories found nearly 50% of parents with children below five years of age unable to access immunisation services. The figure was considerably high in Jammu and Kashmir with 77.14% children below five years unable to get immunisation services.”According to the rapid online perception study, in J&K, nearly 35% of the respondents reported that their children had not received medical help during the lockdown, resulting in difficulties to cope with their children’s illnesses and health hazards.The study also talks about more systemic arrangements and logistical preparedness to ensure that children with no or compromised digital reach are not deprived of the right to education.With online classes introduced as a substitute for schools during the lockdown, access to education for children remained a major issue of concern, as many of them, especially the ones from marginalised and financially poor backgrounds found it difficult without smartphones and internet access.The survey findings revealed that in only 27.62% households in the UT, school-going children could access online classes on a regular basis, the national figures are equally worrying with children of barely 41% household could access online classes – thus raising a serious question about the justification of virtual classrooms as an alternative of school education on a long term basis, until every household is equipped with internet access and smartphones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/77-kids-below-5-yrs-in-j-k-couldn-t-access-basic-healthcare-services-during-lockdown-cry/story-xl1jr2Kc0t1LMiHoNzhFFL.html

Even when 302 was not added so far thus providing blanket coverage to the accused DGP.”They submitted that the court while granting bail had totally ignored that the case was 29-year old and it will be impossible to make headway in investigations without custodial interrogation. The prosecution also submitted that the court while granting anticipatory bail ignored the statement of eyewitness advocate Gursharan Kaur Mann, pertaining to illegal detention and torture of Balwant at Saini’s order.”A fresh FIR was registered against Saini at Mataur police station on May 6, accusing him of abduction of Balwant Singh Multani on the complaint of Palwinder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/abduction-case-against-ex-dgp-court-likely-to-decide-on-transfer-of-case-on-july-2/story-CHJTNwI1WLI6up7VQEUsMO.html

It was Maharaja Hari Singh, the then Ruler of J&K, who enacted a law on state subject in Jammu and Kashmir by a royal decree in 1927,” he stated in his petition.The purpose to introduce this law was to ensure the lands of poor farmers in Jammu, Kashmir and Ladakh, does not fall in the hands of big landlords and moneyed people from outside. It was this law which continued with the full backing of the people of Jammu and Kashmir from all regions and all classes and religious groups.Prof Singh expressed deep shock and anger on behalf of all permanent residents of Jammu and Kashmir on this dictatorial order that a tehsildar/employee from anywhere in the country can issue the domicile certificate to the outsiders.He warned that this recent declaration of the Centre shall not be accepted by the people of Jammu and Kashmir under any circumstances. He announced that the Panthers Party shall hold an urgent meeting of the representatives of all the political parties in Jammu and Kashmir to decide in this matter how to save this permanent residents’ status.He also had called an urgent meeting of the senior lawyers to decide an immediate legal action to stop J&K administration from issuing domicile certificates.Navin Kumar Choudhary, a senior J&K cadre IAS officer from Bihar, was among 25,000 people who have been granted a domicile certificate the other day.However, former bureaucrat Amit Kushari, who served in the Union territory for 37 years, was quick to take a jibe at Choudhary by saying “even if the certificate was given to me on a silver plate, I would never have taken it”.Replaced by PRC, the new domicile certificate guarantees the right to education, employment and buying land in Jammu and Kashmir.Sources said that over 36,000 applications have been received by the government out of which nearly 26000 have been issued domicile certificates so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/domicile-to-outsiders-in-j-k-unconstitutional-panthers-party/story-djNzY7iFSxhyiQatYmnAIK.html
29-06-2020||City||ASI among 3 booked for honey trapping, extorting money from Ludhiana realtor||Three persons, including an assistant sub-inspector (ASI) posted at Daba police station, have been arrested for allegedly laying a honeytrap for a 45-year-old realtor and trying to extort Rs 50 lakh from him. The accused, identified as ASI Dharminder Singh, Manjit Kaur, 30, of City Enclave of Dhandhra road, and Sukhwinder Singh alias Sukha, a cable operator of Dhillon Nagar of Lohara, had videotaped the realtor in a compromising position and were blackmailing him with it.Police have recovered Rs 7 lakh cash that the accused extorted from the complainant, besides a car and mobile phone used in the crime.WOMAN HAD COME IN TOUCH WITH HIM FOR BUYING A PLOTThe complainant told the police that he had come in touch with Manjit Kaur, who had introduced herself as Gurpreet Kaur of Jawaddi Kalan, a few months ago. She told him that she had separated from her husband and was interested in buying a 100 square yard plot. Though she did not buy any property, she remained in touch with the complainant over phone and even borrowed money from him, citing financial constraints. USED SPY CAMERA FITTED IN HANDBAG TO TAPE COMPLAINANTOn June 24, he, along with the woman, went to his friend’s office where she videotaped him in a compromising position through a spy camera fitted in her handbag.The next day, the realtor received a call from ASI Dharminder Singh, who asked him to meet him near a liquor vend. “When I reached there, the ASI, along with Sukhwinder Singh alias Sukha, who introduced himself as a scribe, demanded Rs. 50 lakh and told me that if I don’t pay them, they would circulate my video on social networking sites and also lodge a rape case against me,” he said.The realtor then paid them Rs 7 lakh in cash but later filed a complaint with the Daba police. Following the recovery of the cash from their possession, police registered a case under Sections 384 (extortion), 388 (extortion by threat of accusation of an offence punishable with death or imprisonment for life), 419 (cheating by personation), 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property), 166A (public servant disobeying law, with intent to cause injury to any person), 506 (criminal intimidation ) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code and Section 67, 67-A of the Information and Technology Act.ASI HAD BEEN RECENTLY PROMOTEDThe ASI, who has now been suspended, was additionally booked under Sections 13 (2), 13 (8) 67, 67 A of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Fuel price hike: Congress activists hold agitation across Punjab||The Congress organised a nationwide stir against the rising prices of petrol and diesel on Monday, demonstrations were also held in Sangrur, Patiala, Amritsar, Faridkot, Bathinda and SBS Nagar. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar led the protests at Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar. To lodge their protest against rising fuel prices, Jakhar accompanied by local MLA’s Angad Singh, Darshan Lal Mangupur and Youth Congress president Brinder Singh Dhillon pulled a tractor with ropes from Industrial Training Institute (ITI) to the deputy commissioner’s office. Jakhar said, “The tractor, an instrument of change that brought about the green revolution, has become a cart for farmers as they cannot afford the high prices of diesel.” “The Centre should applaud the work done by the farmers amid the Covid-crisis as Punjab has produced a bumper wheat crop of 1.27 lakh tones. Instead, the BJP has passed anti-farmer ordinances,” the Congress leader said. “The prices of fuel have been steadily rising over the last three weeks as the central government has been imposing excise duty on fuel. Thus, for the first time the prices of diesel have exceeded that of petrol,” he said. “When the Congress was in power in 2014, the price of crude oil was 104 dollars per barrel and the price of diesel was Rs 63 per litre. Now, crude oil is hardly 40 dollars per barrel but still the price of diesel has reached Rs 80,” he said, demanding an explanation from the Modi government. The 17-rupee difference between the rates during the Congress’ and Modi-government’s terms has put an additional burden of ₹7,000 on the farmers. The Modi government was fooling the farmers when it said that farmers’ income will be doubled. Referring to the farm ordinances and Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar’s statement asserting the system of offering minimum support price (MSP) will remain, Jakhar said, “The real question is whether the government will buy the crop or not. The MSP fixed by the Centre for maize is Rs 1,850 in Punjab but farmers were seen selling their produce for Rs 400-Rs 600 per quintal.” Jakhar and other leaders submitted a memorandum addressed to the President to SBS Nagar deputy commissioner Shena Aggarwal. YOUTH LEADERS RAISE THE BANNER IN SANGRUR Members of the Punjab Youth Congress and National Students’ Union of India (NSUI) staged a protest at the district administration complex in Sangrur. The protesters pulled a tractor with a rope to demonstrate the impact of the hike on farmers. Congress leader Daman Thind Bajwa said businesses had been badly affected due to Covid-19 over the past three months but the government of India had hiked petrol and diesel prices instead of helping the citizens.“The hike in diesel prices will directly affect farmers, who are already under debt, during the paddy season,” Bajwa said. ‘PRICES INCREASED 20 TIMES IN THREE MONTHS’ Protests were also held in the south Malwa region. Led by senior leaders, Congress workers submitted memorandums addressed to the President demanding withdrawal of the price hike.In Faridkot, Congress MP Mohammad Sadique said, “In a display of insensitivity, the BJP-led Centre has increased fuel prices around 20 times in three months.” Congress (urban) Arun Jeet Mal president said people were already suffering due to the Covid-19 outbreak and the fuel price hike was adding to their woes: “It is for the first time that the rates of diesel are higher than petrol. Around 70% diesel is used by the farming and transportation sector. The unprecedented rise in diesel prices will lead to a significant increase in prices of different goods and the common man will bear the brunt,” he said.NDA FAILED TO CONTROL INFLATION: PATIALA LEADERSCongress leaders and workers in Patiala handed a memorandum addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi demanding reduction of fuel prices t Patiala deputy commissioner Kumar Amit.Patiala district Congress committee president KK Malhotra said, “The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) has completely failed to control inflation at a time when people are facing an acute financial crisis due to Covid-19.” “The union government should immediately reduce fuel prices and give some respite to the common man. The government should lower taxes to control fuel prices,” Malhotra said. Patiala mayor Sanjeev Sharma Bittu said the crude oil prices were under control but the Centre was hell-bent on increasing fuel prices without taking people’s financial condition into consideration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fuel-price-hike-congress-activists-hold-agitation-across-punjab/story-s2e7rowuU5Q0yqscmgXo5I.html

Former minister Raman Bhalla said, “The BJP government is fleecing people by imposing heavy taxes. When they assumed power in 2014, the excise duty was ₹9.20 per litre on petrol and ₹3.46 per litre on diesel. In six years, it has increased to ₹23.78 per litre on petrol and ₹28.37 per litre on diesel. A 820% hike on diesel and 258% on petrol is shocking,” he said. Later, the leaders submitted a memorandum to the President of India via the Jammu district magistrate.The Congress also protested against the rising prices of petrol and diesel in Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh. Led by Himachal Pradesh Congress Committee (HPCC) general secretary Ajay Mahajan, the party leaders submitted a memorandum to President Ram Nath Kovind alleging that as the common masses are reeling due to Covid-19 outbreak, the BJP government was turning disaster into opportunity to make quick bucks. They said the government has burdened the people by increasing the excise duty on petrol and diesel.They said that the increase in fuel prices will result in rise in prices of essential commodities adversely affecting the lives of people. The party asked the Centre to cut fuel prices and extend benefits of low oil prices in international market to public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/congress-protests-against-hike-in-petrol-diesel-prices-in-j-k-himachal/story-ZAmdndPEFcpbLwRstySoCI.html

In 2019 Lok Sabha elections too, it had to drop the slogan after entering into an alliance with Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP).Singed with both the alliance experiences, Akhilesh has been reiterating that his party will go it alone in 2022 to hit the target of winning 351 seats in the 403 seats UP Assembly. On Thursday, the day after the union cabinet approved international status for the Kushinagar airport, Akhilesh tweeted: “SP’s work for people” and added “Congratulate those who initiated the Kushinagar airport work during the SP’s rule. Also approve the SP government’s time’s pending airport projects in Meerut, Moradabad, Chitrakoot, and Azamgarh.”On Tuesday (June 23), Akhilesh hash-tagged a video of Ghaziabad-Delhi elevated road as ‘Kaam Bolta Hai’; the day before--on June 22-- a picture of Jai Prakash Narain International Centre (JPNIC) and a video of Deoband-Saharnpur four land highway; on June 21, a video of Noida Shilp Hut and Bunkar Bhawan (the craft and weavers facility); on June 19, a picture of a fighter jet landing on Agra-Lucknow Expressway; On June 18-the Noida cycle track; and on June 14--the free laptop distribution scheme.“Akhiliesh ji’s government was synonymous with the big-ticket development works for the public--Metro, laptop scheme, expressway. And this government has done nothing except tall claims and lies. Now, people know the difference.

29-06-2020||Pune||Pune one of four knowledge devp clusters sanctioned in country||Pune city has been identified an one of four science and technology knowledge cluster development cities in the country. The official announcement is yet to be made, according to officials involved with the project, who, however, confirmed the sanction.The approval, which came from Niti Ayog, also includes Hyderabad, Bengaluru and Delhi.“Knowledge clusters would be a connection between industries and research institutes. The objective would be to provide visibility and understand the strength of the academic institutes and work together in product development,” said Prof Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), which is at the heart of the cluster in many ways.The proposal was initially undertaken by the Principal Secretary Advisor (PSA) of Government of India and the sanctions came during the lockdown period.Karmalkar said, “In Pune, all the academic institutes and industries were striving for the last one year and it has finally been sanctioned”“The concept of knowledge cluster city is the seat of excellence for academics and research and also there is industry. So coming together of both these sectors will provide visibility. Industries will understand the strength of academic institutes,” said Karmalkar.“There would be hand-holding and knowledge transfers which is the basic concept,” he added.“It is about the understanding of the requirements of society and industry. Accordingly, students can orient their knowledge or undertake research as per industry requirements. That, to an extent, will help the students with employment,” said Karmalkar.“It is a seamless integration of industry and all disciplines in the university campus and that is the working model. So during the lockdown period, we thought that we can help the local administration to curb the spread of this disease. And hence we are now concentrating on covid related projects,” he added.The Pune city knowledge cluster project is chaired by Somak Raychaudhary, director, Inter-University Centre for Astronomy and Astrophysics (IUCAA). Along with several research institutes in Pune, 30 industries have also been part of this cluster. The main aim of this project is to link academia and research institutes, governing bodies and industries. They will create a knowledge research base that can convert technology into products for society. Also, it will look for solutions to local, state-level and national.SPPU degrees will allow multi-stream subjects from other institutesAccording to Prof Nitin Karmalkar, vice-chancellor, Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) students can pursue one degree from one university and study a subject from another university. Karmalkar said, “It will be possible under this knowledge cluster project and the students will also get credit marks in his/her mark sheet for the subjects.”“Many things can be done under this project, like the involvement of multiple courses can run with industries partnership. The main aim of this cluster project is the seamless integration of industries and institutes, which we are currently lacking behind,” said Karmalkar.“SPPU is part of this project and there are several other universities, research institutes and top industries are involved in this cluster project,” he added. ..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-one-of-four-knowledge-devp-clusters-sanctioned-in-country/story-uYuAwUH0otAACjAgSS1AKN.html
29-06-2020||City||Undo damage done by fairness creams, give out a clear message that ‘Black is beautiful’||Hindustan Unilever, which perpetuated and reinforced deep seated racial, castist and colour prejudices in the Indian consumers’ psyche for decades through its skin whitening cream Fair and Lovely, thereby belittling and deriding dark skin, has decided to remove not just the word “fair” from the name of the product, but also stop using words like ‘ whitening’ and ‘lightening’. The manufacturer has said the company wants to adopt a holistic approach to beauty and celebrate all skin tones!If one wants to take a charitable view of this sudden change of heart, one can say that the strong global movement against racial and colour prejudices, following the death of George Floyd on May 25 at the hands of Minneapolis police in the United States, influenced this decision. The uncharitable view would be the manufacturer is taking pre-emptive action in view of the government’s proposal to prohibit all advertisements pertaining to products promoting ‘fairness of the skin’ under the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act. I do believe that it is the latter because this product has sold and garnered a big slice of the market on the strength of its advertisements, endorsed by film celebrities unabashedly brainwashing the viewers that you need to be fair in order be beautiful, to be successful and to find a spouse.In the last several years, many social activists and women’s groups have taken up cudgels against not just Fair and Lovely, but a host of other skin whitening, lightening products in the market, but without much success. Even criticism of film actors who endorsed such whitening products, did not have the desired effect. Last August, even the Indian Army took objection to these advertisements and said those depicting actors in military fatigues needed prior approval from the Army. One of the triggers was a shameful advertisement of a fairness cream for men, Emami Fair and Handsome, using actors in Army Uniform. It shows a cadet intending to join the army using his sister’s fairness cream and later when he joins the Army, Shahrukh Khan, as an officer, encourages him to use the Fair and Handsome cream, saying-“zindagi me dono zaroori hai. Dam bhi, handsome bhi”. Again -- the message is clear -- you are handsome if you are fair and you are successful if you are handsome.Finally, the government has stepped in and used the obvious route, the Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act to put stop to advertisements of fairness creams. The draft Amendment Bill, put out for public comments by the union ministry of health and Family welfare in February this year, basically plugs three main lacunae in the original Act. (1) It changes the definition of advertisement to include all media -- old and new. So unlike the original law, it covers advertisements on the electronic media, internet, websites, so that no media escapes the purview of the law. Equally important, the definition of advertisement also covers endorsement. So celebrity endorses cannot get away. Second, it enhances the punishment for contravention -- in case of first conviction, the penalty may extend to a fine of Rs 10 lakh and imprisonment of two years and in case of a subsequent conviction, fine up to Rs 50 lakh and imprisonment up to five years.But even more important, the law prohibits, among others, advertisements pertaining to products promoting ‘Fairness of the skin’. Thus the Bill, when it becomes a law, puts stop to any advertisement pertaining to products that promise to whiten or lighten your skin.Since Covid-19 has put a big question mark on when the Parliament will meet again, the government should bring in the amendment bill through the ordinance route, thus ending all advertisements of fairness creams at the earliest. Side by side, the government should also start a campaign to undo the damage done by fairness creams all these years and give out a clear message that ‘Black is beautiful’.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/undo-damage-done-by-fairness-creams-give-out-a-clear-message-that-black-is-beautiful/story-2PsjboPA2ELoDX0SdObqlK.html

Some of them wrote ‘suffer’ for ‘yatra’. This reflects their level of the knowledge of the language,” she said.She further said that majority of the students tend to ignore Hindi because they feel there is no need to study the language which does not offer future prospects.Board officials, meanwhile, said that the number of students failing in Hindi was around 10 lakh last year. Around 56 lakh students had appeared in the Board examinations of the UP Board this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/7-97-lakh-students-fail-in-hindi-in-up-board-exams/story-ejySIS0VkdDiNXEEYSDd5L.html
29-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi to get plasma bank to help Covid-19 patients: CM Arvind Kejriwal||The Delhi government will set up a plasma bank to help Covid-19 patients in the city, announced chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at a press conference this afternoon. It is likely to be the first such bank in the country. Use of plasma therapy involves injecting blood-component plasma extracted from a cured coronavirus patient into a positive case. The plasma of a cured patient is considered to carry virus-fighting antibodies which boost the immune system’s response to the disease. Plasma is the almost-clear liquid left behind after red and white blood cells and platelets are removed from the blood. The plasma bank – which will operate largely like a blood bank – will be set up in the Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS) hospital in south Delhi and the services can be availed by patients admitted in both government and private hospitals, but it has to be recommended by a doctor, the chief minister said.Watch l ‘Will build plasma bank in Delhi to help Covid patients’: Arvind Kejriwal “There is high demand for plasma therapy among people. Around two months ago, we were one of the first states to start plasma therapy trials. In the first phase, we conducted plasma trials on 29 patients (in Lok Nayak hospital). The results are good. It has been observed that plasma therapy helps stabilise respiratory rate of moderate to severe patients and it can save lives. But it cannot save patients with multi-organ failures, those in extremely severe conditions,” said Kejriwal in a press briefing.He further said, “The Delhi government has decided to set up a plasma bank in ILBS Hospital. This will probably be the first plasma bank of the country. Any Covid-cured individual would be able to donate plasma and active Covid patients admitted in both private and government hospitals would be able to avail it. But only a doctor can recommend plasma therapy and it cannot be randomly sought by any Covid patient. After recommendation, the concerned hospital has to inform ILBS for plasma.”The chief minister said that the government is working out the modalities of the plasma bank and they shall be finalised in another two days. “This will streamline the plasma therapy system in the city. The arrangement is in ILBS hospital because it is not a Covid hospital. The donors are safe and they will not be infected again. The government will also be paying for their conveyance,” said Kejriwal, urging more Covid-19 recovered patients to donate blood plasma in the coming days.He further said that the government will soon set up a helpline in which potential plasma donors can call up and health officials would also start calling recovering Covid-19 patients to donate plasmaJugal Kisore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, welcomed the move but recommended that the government should rather create a set of plasma centres in the coming days to ensure that there is no excessive stress on the infrastructure of one particular hospital.“Availability of plasma is a big issue. So far, both private and government hospitals which got approval for plasma therapy on Covid-19 patients maintained their own plasma banks. A centralised system would streamline the process and enable better monitoring, better data management and grievance redressal. However, having one such bank for the whole city can put excessive stress on the concerned hospital. The government, in the coming days, should create a network of plasma banks by setting up more facilities in accordance with locations of Covid-dedicated hospitals in the city,” Kishore said.Last week, the chief minister had said that plasma therapy in Lok Nayak Hospital has helped reduce death rate by around 50%. Data shared by the government on Sunday showed that the government hospital witnessed 51 deaths in the week between June 20 and 26, as against 100 deaths recorded between June 6 and 12. The Delhi government has also got the Centre’s approval for 200 more plasma therapy trials, following which they also roped in the Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-to-get-plasma-bank-to-help-covid-19-patients-cm-arvind-kejriwal/story-yT9IXryfQLxqr2eB2KjGAO.html

Parents also alleged that the school denied giving them school essentials unless they paid the hiked fees. A spokesperson from the school said in a written statement, “While the school is imparting online education to all its students irrespective of payment of fees, the school is not in a financial position to provide the study materials without the corresponding payment as the same has to be simultaneously procured by the school against a substantial cost.The school is not forcing, threatening any parent to pay fees, nor showing any bias towards any parent who has not paid fees, and any allegation in this regard is denied in its entirety.” Schools under the VIBGYOR group had hiked fees by 8-10% for each class in February this year and the hike is effective for the academic year 2020-21. A government resolution released on May 8 stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and have to allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was however stayed by the Bombay High Court on June 26 in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners. Parents said that while the hike was imposed in February, they started facing issues in payment due to the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak. “Many parents have lost their jobs and businesses while several others are working with huge pay cuts. At such a point we are only hoping that the school considers our plea on humanitarian grounds,” said the parent of the school’s Goregaon branch. Parents alleged that they were being denied school essentials and were asked to first get their fee receipts. “We have not heard from the school despite several emails and letters. On the other hand, the school has now started discriminating against students whose parents have refused to pay hiked fees by threatening to remove them from online learning groups and not giving them study material,” said another parent from Navi Mumbai. At the protest, parents said that they would collectively write to the school and the state education department requesting a hearing on their concerns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/parents-in-mumbai-protest-vibgyor-fee-hike-school-says-need-it-for-study-material/story-xVKEPnE91aZGW9MIGOrdWK.html

Cyber police officers have said that those visiting porn sites have been getting random emails, threatening to make their online activities public to extort money from them. The police have appealed to internet users not to visit porn sites, and to report to the police immediately if they get such mails.

29-06-2020||City||Thane to go under lockdown again?||Additional civic commissioner Ganesh Deshmukh on Sunday asked residents from 22 areas to stock up essentials, raising speculations of a lockdown at these places. Some of these areas include Balkum, Kolshet, Dhokali, Ram Maruti Road, Manpada, some parts of Ghodbunder Road, Lokmanya Nagar, Savarkar Nagar, Shanti Nagar, Kisan Nagar, Wagle Estate, Padwal Nagar, Warli Pada and Indira Nagar. With 341 new cases, the total number of Covid-19 cases in the city reached 8,168, while the death toll is now at 277, after 14 new deaths.“The increase in crowding in some areas and the sudden spike in the cases have led us to consider implementing a lockdown in these areas. The commissioner will take a final call on Monday, but I request residents to be prepared and cooperate with the civic body. Those in the hot spots [Kalwa, Mumbra, Kausa, Kopri and Naupada] have to be more careful and avoid stepping out of their homes except for essential services,” said Deshmukh.While essential services will continue to remain operational in these areas, the movement of residents will be restricted. “We deployed a strict nakabandi at all points within the Thane Commissionerate. If we find passengers in vehicles beyond the permissible numbers, we shall confiscate the vehicles. No one should be roaming unnecessarily,” said Amit Kale, deputy commissioner of police, Thane traffic division.Meanwhile, some malls and salons have reopened in the city after more than 100 days. “We have given time slots for our customers, and based on prior appointments they visit our salon. We have made all necessary safety arrangements, from providing sanitisers to ensuring everyone wears safety gears such as mask and gloves at the salon. We are also cleaning all equipment at regular intervals,” said Javed Shaikh, owner of Kraft Salon at Patlipada. Meanwhile, popular malls in Thane have made available time slots online for customers. Those who wish to visit malls have one have to take appointments, following which a QR code will be provided to them, through which they can gain access to the mall. This step is taken in a bid to ensure fewer inside the mall, making it easier to maintain social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-to-go-under-lockdown-again/story-b8tH4ENJYnbW61u1LtbohO.html
29-06-2020||Mumbai||Inflated electricity bills shock film, TV actors||After many citizens complained of receiving ‘inflated bills’ in June, Bollywood and TV personalities also took to social media on Sunday and stated that they were shocked a see a massive surge in their power bills.Actor Taapsee Pannu on Sunday said that she received a bill of ₹36,000 in June – a sharp surge from her May and April bills of ₹3,850 and ₹4,390, respectively. “3 months of lockdown and I wonder what appliance(s) I have newly used or bought in the apartment only last month to have such an insane rise in my electricity bill. @Adani_Elec_Mum what kind of POWER r u charging us for? (sic),” she tweeted. Pannu also claimed that the said apartment is vacant, which she visits only once a week.Actor Dino Morea also took to Twitter to complain about the bill he received. “Literally got a shock, pun intended. There was no surge in electricity, just the bill. @Adani_Elec_Mum,” the actor tweeted.Meanwhile, comedian Vir Das asked citizens in Mumbai if they too have received a bill that is three times more than what they usually pay. In reply to his tweet, actor Ashish Chowdhry tweeted, “Gosh I did. And yes, three times. It’s a massive jump. Went and checked all the geysers in the house if they were on for a month @TataPower.”TV actor Saumya Tandon claimed that she received a bill of ₹28,000, as against other months, during which she gets bills worth an average of ₹8,000.Over the past one week, citizens across the state expressed shock over their recent bills stating a two to three-fold jump when compared to the previous months’ amounts.Distribution companies, however, maintained that there have been no errors.Power officials said that as actual meter-reading was suspended since March-end owing to the lockdown, consumers were sent bills as per the average usage of December, January and February. However, consumption is on the higher side in March, April and May, owing to the summer season, combined with the lockdown during which citizens are confined to their homes and so consumers would have utilised more power.Following Pannu’s complaint on Twitter, an Adani Electricity Mumbai Limited (AEML) spokesperson said, “Upon receipt of the complaint, we have verified the meter reading and found (it) to be correct.”A spokesperson from AEML said, “This rise in electricity consumption has been witnessed by household consumers of all utilities due to the lockdown, and enhanced power consumption patterns was observed among such consumers. In some segments, power consumption has increased by two-three-fold.”In a statement released this week, Tata Power stated, “Tata Power would like the consumers to look for such lifestyle changes while reflecting over last 3 months of lockdown and compare it with lifestyle pre lockdown or last year same months.”AEML and Tata power supply power in parts of the city.The Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Ltd (MSEDCL), which received thousands of complaints, also set-up consumer grievance cells in all its offices to address queries.State will seek funds from Centre for MSEDCL State energy minister Nitin Raut on Sunday said that the government will soon write to the Centre seeking funds for MSEDCL. Earlier this week, Raut had stated that the state electricity distribution company suffered losses of more than ₹3,500 crore owing to lack of meter-reading and non-payment of actual usage charges during the lockdown. Apart from this, MSEDCL has also suffered losses owing to Cyclone Nisarga that damaged several cables and electric poles in the state, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/inflated-electricity-bills-shock-film-tv-actors/story-B5GzDrjCFO2FfowXxNMeHI.html
29-06-2020||City||Mumbai civic corporation increases Covid-19 tests by 11.4% in a month||To contain the spread of Covid-19, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has ramped up testing by 11.4% over the past one month. The number of tests went up to 1,33,493 between May 27 and June 26, from 1,19,825 tests between April 26 and May 26.Mumbai recorded 1,287 fresh cases and 87 new deaths on Sunday. Of the 87 deaths, 64 were not reported in the past 24 hours, but added to the total after figures were reconciled. The city’s case tally rose to 75,539, while the toll touched 4,371. The number of discharged patients was 43,154, with a recovery rate of 57.12%. Further, active cases stood at 28,006. The fatality rate was 5.78% and doubling rate 41 days. Dharavi, one of the earlier hot spots, has been showing signs of recovery, with only 13 new cases on Sunday, The total cases in the area now stand at 2,245. Currently, BMC claims to have a testing capacity of 8,000 tests a day. On an average, 4,306 people are being tested daily in the city. The city has carried out 3.14 lakh tests so far, according to BMC data. However, experts as well as the Opposition claim Mumbai needs to test more aggressively. BMC has now said with procurement of 1 lakh rapid antigen kits that will deliver results in 30 minutes, the testing capacity will go up by around 2,000-2,500.The city on an average conducted 4,306 tests daily between May 27 and June 26, compared to 3,865 between April 26 and May 26. The positivity rate in the city as of June 26 was 22.96%. The state conducted 2,73,825 tests between April 26 and May 26, compared to 4,81,705 between May 26 and June 26, according to the state health department data.Madhav Sathe, former microbiology professor at Nair Hospital, said, “The scaling in the number of tests has happened, but it is not enough considering the population of a city like Mumbai. However, we also need to consider the challenges to conduct such a large amount of tests. The test is micro. We are focusing on rapid testing kits to bring that pace. We should test around 20,000 samples daily. With BMC procuring rapid antigen kits, there will be a scope to increase the daily testing capacity to 10,000-15,000. This will help curtail the spread. Even western countries had to face many challenges.”BMC last week announced ‘Mission Universal Testing’ to procure 1 lakh rapid antigen kits. A BMC official said, “We will conduct 1 lakh testing using these kits in the city, and it is going to be game-changer to curtail the spread. We have allowed those above 70 years of age get tested without a prescription. Private laboratories are also allowing people to get tested based on e-prescription and high-risk contacts without any prescription. This will ensure testing increases.”Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task-force said, “Mumbai has increased its testing in the past two months, but we need to test more than what we are testing currently. We have been testing as per the protocols laid down by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and the method changes from time to time. One has to consider that we do not have to test the whole population of Mumbai. We are doing a sero-surveillance test, where a larger population is being covered.”Dr Joshi said, “We have to concentrate on areas or wards where the doubling rate is low. Sero-surveillance will help test maximum population.”The surveillance helps diagnose individuals with antibodies for Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19. The survey will be conducted in areas namely Tilak Nagar, Chembur, Matunga, Sion, Wadala, Dahisar and parts of Borivli. During sero-surveillance, residents will undergo blood tests that can detect the presence of antibodies. A total of 10,000 blood samples will be collected.Meanwhile, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on Friday alleged the government and civic body were deliberately testing less to ensure the city’s daily figures don’t show a spike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-civic-corporation-increases-covid-19-tests-by-11-4-in-a-month/story-v2XcsTbCpr2Pcpt5PDK1VL.html
29-06-2020||Mumbai||Have no cash for flight home: Byculla man in US seeks consulate’s help||A Byculla resident living in New Jersey, USA, who was laid off in March, has written to the Indian embassy in New York, requesting a waiver on his airfare to Mumbai, so that he can return before his employment authorisation document (work permit) expires.Aliasgar Merchant, a blockchain developer, said he does not have enough money to buy Air India’s “expensive” $1,361 (₹1,02,929) ticket to fly back under the Vande Bharat Mission. Merchant is waiting to hear from the embassy so that he can leave before July 12, when his work permit expires, to avoid staying illegally in the US.In March, Merchant was retrenched due to losses suffered by his company during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and has since been looking for employment opportunities. However, unable to find a job, he has exhausted all his savings. Merchant had gone to the US in 2017 to pursue a master’s degree in information technology and was working there since.“I am currently in no position to pay my rent for July. My work permit expires on July 12 since I have not yet found a job,” said Merchant. “When I initially approached the Indian Consulate in New York, my name was recommended on the flight scheduled to leave for Mumbai on June 29. However, Air India asked me to pay $1,361 for the flight ticket and directed me to contact the Indian embassy/consulate if I wanted the ticket charges to be waived due to my financial crisis,” said MerchantLast week, Merchant tweeted for help to the Indian embassy in New York when he was told that the airline could not waive the ticket charges.“I also emailed the embassy on Friday, asking for help on humanitarian grounds, so that I can return to Mumbai. I am now hoping that the authority can help me return on any of the flights before July 12,” he added.The US Consulate General of India in New York reverted to Merchant on Sunday night and asked him to submit his bank statement and salary slip. The email accessed by HT read, “In order to consider your case, you are requested to forward your bank statement for the last three months.... last three months pay stub before you lost the job. Once the same is received at our end, your case will be considered.” While a handful of flights are scheduled to arrive in Delhi from San Francisco and New York’s John F Kennedy (JFK) International Airport as part of the fourth phase of Vande Bharat Mission, more departing flights have been scheduled to these destinations. However, only three flights are scheduled to arrive from Newark to Mumbai in the fourth phase on July 4, 6, and 8.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/have-no-cash-for-flight-home-byculla-man-in-us-seeks-consulate-s-help/story-H6TKxWU70JlztrS4oK5gUM.html

He was directed to the railway’s designated Covid hospital, Jagjivan Ram Hospital in Mumbai Central after his swab test results came back positive.After 10 days at the hospital, he was asked to home quarantine for a week.“I was initially nervous and scared as to how, despite taking all the precautions, I got infected. My senior officers and the doctors motivated and helped me to stay positive and calm,” said Jaiswar.The virus, however, did not affect Jaiswar’s willpower, and he resumed work immediately after getting a fitness certificate from the doctors.“Work of RPF is very crucial in the operation of trains, and particularly during the coronavirus pandemic. I wanted to resume work immediately as I felt fit but waited for the doctor’s approval. I resumed work on June 6 and have been working on the movement of passenger trains,” he said.Jaiswar now asks passengers to regularly wash and sanitise their hands on the railway stations. “I tell passengers about my experience and how I overcame it. I tell them to eat healthily and regularly wash and sanitise their hands. One can fight the virus if one has strong willpower,” said Jaiswar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/covid-survivor-rpf-staff-guards-others-against-infection/story-D0pICaOPUVqmnk07iDsY2L.html

The ATMA screens will help limit physical contact between passengers and railway employees during the Covid-19 pandemic.ATMA digital screens will be placed at the entrance of railway stations and will take thermal screenings of passengers and check their tickets.The screens will be placed at Mumbai Central, Bandra Terminus, and Borivli railway stations and will be used for five years.“The digital screens will help limit direct contact, and monitoring of passengers will also be easy,” said a WR official.ATMA will also be able to check if passengers are wearing masks or not. Post the screenings, passengers will have to sanitise their hands, and only then will they be allowed to board the train. Presently, one digital screen has been introduced at Nagpur railway station, and Central Railway (CR) plans on introducing the screens at Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) and Lokmanya Tilak Terminus (LTT).The railways also introduced infrared cameras to conduct thermal screenings of passengers at CSMT and LTT, and a robotic system at Pune railway station has been set up for the same purpose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/automated-screens-to-check-tickets-screen-passengers-at-railway-stations/story-VFLprs4fzq1T2XUiDhK2DO.html
29-06-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s ‘alarming’ surge in Covid-19 cases due to relaxations, migration: Experts||On June 27, Maharashtra reported 6,368 new Covid-19 cases (after reconciliation of 1,050 cases), a record single-day spike not only for the state, but for India as well. This was the fourth consecutive single-day spike record for the western state, India’s worst-affected region that has seen 164,626 cumulative cases. From June 24 to June 28, excluding the record on June 27, Maharashtra recorded 3,890, 4,841, 5,024 and 5,493 new cases.In the past week, until June 27, the state has recorded more than 4,400 new cases a day on average, compared to 3,400 the week before that. The doubling rate of cases – the number of days it takes for a given number of infections to double – has dropped from 24 days a week ago to 22 days as of Saturday.The positivity rate, too, has shown no signs of slowing down. Two weeks ago, the state had an average positivity rate of 20.6%. Since then, it has slowly, but steadily been rising despite a big increase in daily tests — on June 27, the positivity rate stood at 22%. This means that the more samples that the state tests, the more the positive cases. Experts say it is an alarming sign.In the two other states with high caseloads – Tamil Nadu and Delhi – as the testing has been ramped up over the past two weeks, the positivity rate has declined. In Delhi, the average positivity rate has dropped from 30.7% two weeks ago to 18.7% on June 27. The corresponding number has dropped from 12.2% to 9.9% in Tamil Nadu.All three states have significantly ramped their testing in these two weeks. The number of average daily tests has increased from 14,000 to 20,000 in Maharashtra; 18,700 to 30,000 in Tamil Nadu; and 5,200 to 18,000 tests in Delhi in the past two weeks. Maharashtra tested 26,628 samples on Sunday, the highest since the first case was detected on March 9.While Maharashtra’s overall cases have shot up, Mumbai’s cases have plateaued, albeit with a caveat – the number of tests has not risen significantly. For the 10 days from June 15 to June 24, Mumbai tested only 40,110 samples, giving an average of 4,011 tests a day.However, even with a similar number of tests in May and June, Mumbai’s share in the state’s overall cases has fallen from 59.49% on May 28 to 45.89% on June 28. Simultaneously, districts like Pune, Dhule, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Nashik and Solapur among others have recorded almost 10 times rise in cases, say state-appointed district health officers.Relaxation in the national and state lockdowns and migration of workers are the main reasons behind the surge, they say.“In May, most cases were reported from Mumbai and Pune. We had eight orange and five green districts. Now, we don’t have any green districts due to rising Covid-19 cases,” said Dr Pradeep Awate, epidemiologist and state surveillance officer. “Districts like Nanded, Osmanabad, Beed and Bhandara have shown a 100% rise in the number of Covid cases in a month.”According to data provided by the Maharashtra health department, between May 28 and June 27, Mumbai has seen a 118% rise in cases, but other hot spots such as Pune, Dhule, Aurangabad, Nagpur, Nashik and Solapur have recorded almost 10 times that.For example, on May 28, Dhule had only 129 Covid-19 cases. On June 28, this surged to 962 cases. Jalgaon rose from 526 cases on May 28 to 3002 on June 28. Nashik went from 1,043 cases on May 28 to 3902 cases on June 28. On May 28, Pune Municipal Corporation had 6896 cumulative cases. On June 28, this rose to 20,870 cases. “Hundreds of people who were stuck in different parts of the country have returned, and this has contributed to the rise in numbers,” said Dr Awate.The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR), excluding Mumbai, has seen a similar alarming rise. Thane Municipal Corporation cases rose from 3226 on May 28 to 9264 on June 28. Palghar rose from 129 to 5,267 in the same period.“A large portion of Mumbai’s population travels to MMR as they are economically dependent on the area. So, we not only need to control the cases in Mumbai but also in MMR,” said Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state Covid-19 Task Force.HT spoke to 10 district health officers (DHOs), and each of them said the cases have surged primarily due to a relaxation in the national and state lockdowns and the human migration from metropolises to smaller cities and villages. Dr Aniruddha Athalye, (DHO), Satara, said, “We have recorded 42 Covid-related deaths, but 40 of them were migrants from Mumbai who died within a few hours of admission in hospitals due to delay in treatment.” According to him, Satara has 1004 Covid-afflicted people, but 80% of them are those who came from Mumbai, Pune and Uttar Pradesh.In Latur, of the 275 total Covid-19 cases, 95% are migrants. “With the relaxation in the lockdown, several migrants returned home. Gradually, asymptomatic infected people started spreading the disease to their family members. We had zero cases in the first week of May,” said Dr G Garaghe, DHO. Latur had 303 cases on June 28.In Dhule, people got infected while trying to provide food and water to the migrants on Mumbai-Agra highway. “Though it was a noble cause, 45 people contracted the infection,” said Dhule DHO Dr Shivendra Shagle. “Those cases were just the beginning. Soon, it started spreading among others.” Dhule has 962 cumulative cases on June 28, up from 129 a month ago.According to Dr Taranglushar Ware, DHO of Yavatmal, around 20 people who had visited the Tablighi Jamaat event in Delhi in April were the first patients from the district. All DHOs HT spoke to said the general public has not been following physical distancing norms ever since the government announced a relaxation in the lockdown on June 3. “The national lockdown relaxation was implemented for economic reasons, but people are behaving irresponsibly. We are therefore unable to break the infection chain. We have asked the state to extend the lockdown,” said Dr AR Gita, DHO of Aurangabad where cases have increased to 4,833 (June 28) from 1,370 (May 28).Apart from a lack of discipline, health activists blamed the state’s rigid testing policy behind the rise in cases. Dr Athalye said asymptomatic migrants didn’t qualify for a swab test for diagnosis. “Later, these carriers infected more people. If we had tested them earlier, we could have controlled the spread,” he said.Dr Abhijit More, co-convenor of Jan Aarogya Abhiyan, a pan-Maharashtra health sector NGO, criticised the state government for failing to test all the migrants even when they fell in the vulnerable category.He also claimed that due to an inadequate number of testing, thousands of cases are going unreported. “Though Mumbai has reached its plateau, the positivity rate is 22%. This means the number of infected people is high. Many districts may have reached their pandemic peak; so, if we run more tests then we can identify more cases,” said Dr More.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-are-maharashtra-cases-spiking/story-Li2abpW38ypGy5vH35caKP.html

His family claimed that since Tuesday, they had to visit several hospitals to get him treated.Six deaths due to the infection were reported in Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) limits on Sunday, taking the death toll to 107. The city also recorded 369 new cases on Sunday, taking the total count to 5,678.Earlier, a KDMT driver succumbed to the infection. This is the second death in the transport department.As per the family, the conductor, a resident of Ambernath, had to visit several hospitals for treatment before he succumbed to the infection at Thane Civic Hospital on Sunday morning.“On Tuesday, I took my father to the state-run Chaya Hospital in Ambernath where his swab sample was collected, and they asked us to visit Central Hospital in Ulhasnagar. When we went there, they asked us to go to Rukminibai Hospital as there was no doctor available. When we went to Rukminibai Hospital in Kalyan, they did not admit him, saying he is an outsider as he lives in Ambernath,” said the deceased conductor’s 28-year-old son.“We decided to go home as there was no point in roaming. Later, when his health deteriorated, we took him to Poddar Central Hospital in Badlapur, which is a private hospital, and got him admitted there on June 25. The hospital discharged him after two days, saying he was not behaving well. We again went to Chaya Hospital as he was unwell, and they sent my father to Thane Civic Hospital on Saturday evening, where he died the next day,” he added.A representative from Poddar Central Hospital, said, “The patient, who tested positive for Covid -19, was discharged on request from the family.”Epidemic officer of KDMC, Pratibha Panpatil said, “Rukminibai Hospital is a non-Covid hospital and Covid patients are not admitted there for treatment. If a patient comes to Rukmini Hospital, the staff there guide them to the nearest Covid hospital. We will have to look into what went wrong in this case.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmt-conductor-succumbs-family-claims-he-had-to-visit-several-hospitals-for-treatment/story-5hk5sX2nXG0CphUoYP56sL.html
29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Covid test reports delayed to extend stay in Punjab hotels, allege foreign returnees||Many foreign returnees lodged in Punjab hotels for quarantine soon after their landing in India have alleged fleecing at the hands of the hotels in collusion with the health department officials, claiming that their Covid-19 test reports are being delayed to extend their stay beyond the stipulated period. The health department, however, said those lodged in hotels can’t be forced to stay beyond one week. “Those coming from abroad are taken straightaway to hotels and we take their samples for the coronavirus testing after five days. The test reports in most cases come in two days. If a person is tested negative, they are allowed to go home immediately,” said state’s Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. As per the state government’s guidelines, those returning from abroad are required to stay in 14-day quarantine — first week in a hotel designated by the health department and second week at home if they test negative for the virus. Inderpal Singh Parmar, a software engineer who landed in New Delhi after his return from the US 10 days ago and was lodged in a hotel in Kharar last Saturday, said it has been five days since a medical team took his samples but report has not arrived yet.“I got no clarity about the test reports despite my repeated requests to the hotel authorities. I can’t speak to anyone other than the hotel staff. I am not allowed to go out of the room,” he said. Puneet Verma, who came back from the US after attending a training course, said, “We were taken to a hotel in Kharar on June 20. It has been nine days since but there’s no information as to when we would be allowed to go home.”“The hotel has already charged ₹27,500 from me for a week’s stay and is asking us to pay more for the stay of two days,” he added.Of those who travelled in the San Francisco-Delhi flight last week, 10 were from Punjab. Of these, at least six were lodged in a Mohali hotel.Hotels are charging an average ₹4,000 per day from those lodged for quarantine. The total bill for a week comes around ₹28,000 and but most people end up paying more by the time they check out due to delay in test reports, said another occupant under quarantine in a hotel in Mohali.Parmar said the similar issue cropped up in a Mohali hotel where travellers were lodged. “They were given their test reports only after they created a ruckus last night. Their stay was also delayed by at least four days on the pretext of non-receipt of test reports,” he said. Principal secretary (medical education) DK Tiwari said delay in Covid-19 testing is rare. “An average 9,000 tests are conducted daily by the three government medical colleges. We have given instructions that there should be no backlog and all test reports must be prepared the same day,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-test-reports-delayed-to-extend-stay-in-punjab-hotels-allege-foreign-returnees/story-ok2pbqcYgD1ydFcR745IZI.html
29-06-2020||Mumbai||For the poor, online learning a big obstacle||Vikram Adsul, a teacher from a zilla parishad school in Karjat Ahmednagar, is having busier days since the lockdown led to closure of schools in March. Adsul’s school, nested in a small hamlet called Bandgar Vasti, has students from the Dhangar community, many of whom have no access to mobiles and internet. “While many schools have smoothly transitioned from offline to online, students like ours who already struggle to get access to education are finding it difficult to adapt. Many do not have smartphones, and even the ones who have them have no internet range. We have to call students and talk to them or meet them every few days to keep their morale high in addition to teaching them,” said Adsul. As the uncertainty around physical reopening of schools continues with increasing number of Covid-19 cases, online learning has become the new normal for schools across the country. However, for lakhs of students from underprivileged backgrounds in cities and villages, online learning might be no learning, say experts. To begin with, data from the state education department early this month reveals that over 26% students in Maharashtra do not have access to even a mobile phone; which can act as a big barrier in online learning. “In remote parts of the state and the country, we cannot sustain with the online-only model for a long time. Children need schools not just for actual studies but also to have a conducive learning and growing environment which their homes often fail to provide. Schools are an empowering space, especially for girls,” said Hemangi Joshi, an RTE activist from Mumbai. “Things like midday meals are also big factors in drawing students to schools. Online-only learning would mean that a lot of these students are likely to drop out.” Barriers beyond accessWhile issue regarding access is a key concern, experts say it is just the tip of the iceberg. Even in cases where students have access to phones or internet, their parents who come from low income groups with little or no education are likely to find it difficult to support their learning at home. Padma Sarangapani, chairperson, Centre for Education Innovation and Action Research at the Tata Institute of Social Sciences (TISS), said a lot of the responsibility for a child’s learning will now depend on parents. “The question is whether parents have the time, bandwidth and orientation to support their children’s learning, and whether the government schooling system can put into place a system of supporting parents to learn and access resources for their children,” she added.Chetna Duggal, project director at the School Initiative of Mental Health Advocacy at TISS, said migration and resultant emotional distress among low income households due to the pandemic has an impact on the child’s overall wellbeing, thereby affecting learning. “Witnessing and experiencing parental distress, financial crisis, undergoing transitions, disruptions of routine, lack of safe spaces and inability to meet peers and supportive people can have deep psychological impact on children. This can interfere with their capacity to pay attention, concentrate and engage with learning new material or developing new skills,” she added. In Mumbai, the migrant exodus has displaced nearly 1.15 lakh or 21% of the total students enrolled in civic and private primary schools, data from the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation reveals. Rajkiran Chavan, a teacher from Solapur, said seeing and interacting with their teachers on a regular basis is key to learning for children from low income families, something that is disrupted during the pandemic. “Not all students have the bandwidth to see live videos. But even the preloaded content on various educational apps is not customised for their needs. They lose interest in the content due to language barriers and lack of subjectivity in content,” said Chavan. The way aheadWhile the state education department has announced the commencement of the academic year 2020-21 from June 15, the reopening of physical schools is likely to take a couple of months more. Sarangapani said the most important thing that schools need to do during these tough times is to not expect pedagogical outcomes from parents. “We don’t want parents to become teaching assistants and teach their children ‘literacy’ and ‘numeracy’. But we can expect them to do various kinds of interactive activities with their children, and make sure their children can read aloud to them. One possibility is to have a resource library accessible to parents who can access these for their children to use and get some advice on how to use and what to expect,” she added.Chavan and a group of 45-odd teachers in Solapur have decided to prepare a video resource library for students across the state where teachers aim to create over 1,000 educational videos in the next two months. “These will be short videos that can be opened with slow internet and will be easy to understand.”The role of school leaders and teachers is considered to be crucial in the interim. “They too might need support on how to get in touch with parents and have conversations over phone or chat to check on the wellbeing and safety of families and children, or develop skills in conducting emotional check-ins with students and opening up conversations with them about how they are coping at this time, and how to respond if children are in distress or at risk,” added Duggal. Duggal is now spearheading an initiative called ‘Back to School’ launched by the School Initiative of Mental Health Advocacy which aims to support emotional well-being of students by training and sensitising school leaders, teachers and counsellors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/for-the-poor-online-learning-a-big-obstacle/story-re2p66QtL9afsndF9qGsmL.html
29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Nobody from administration approached us for suggestions, allege Chandigarh RWAs||Though the UT administrator in his war room briefings had asked the administration to liaise with the resident welfare associations (RWAs) to control the spread of coronavirus, the RWAs have said that neither were they contacted nor were the authorities willing to listen to their suggestions.Chairman of Chandigarh Residents’ Association Welfare Federation (CRAWFED) Hitesh Puri said, “Nobody from the administration has approached us for any suggestions. Local BJP leader Arun Sood had held virtual meetings with us to understand what problems we faced during the lockdown, but that was that.”Echoing the sentiment, organising secretary of Federation of Sector Welfare Associations Chandigarh (FOSWAC) Sandeep Bhalla said, “Our communication with the administration is very one-sided. They approach us with surveys for smart city and waste segregation, but when we approach them with suggestions and complaints, they hardly pay heed.”Bhalla, who is also the organising secretary of the Sector-21 RWA where the first Covid case of the city was reported from, said the administration did not involve the RWA in any way after cases started coming up.General secretary of the Sector 33-B RWA Kuljinder Singh Sra said he told the authorities multiple times to monitor the vendors as they didn’t wear masks and moved without permits. “My complaints have not been taken seriously. I have even told the police beat officials but no action was taken,” he said.UT adviser Manoj Parida said, “RWAs are free to volunteer just as many local citizens’ bodies are doing. It would be helpful if RWAs could monitor and keep watch on residents in their own localities and inform health authorities about violations in social distancing. RWAs can play a great role in spreading awareness.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/nobody-from-administration-approached-us-for-suggestions-allege-chandigarh-rwas/story-O7kp0Gxl4ze0MiHZhcJdoO.html
29-06-2020||City||Moga farmer installs meter to gauge water usage via direct paddy sowing technique||A progressive farmer in Moga district’s Talwandi Bhangeria village has installed a meter on the pump irrigating his paddy fields to measure water usage through the direct seeding of rice (DSR) technique. Also, he has installed another meter to measure electricity consumed to pump water into the fields. A team led by state agriculture director Sutantar Kumar Airi recently inspected the fields of Harmanjeet Singh who has adopted the technique to sow paddy on 26 acres with a view to saving water. Plant protection officer Dr Jaswinder Singh Brar, who accompanied the team, said, “With the help of these meters, we will compare water usage after two months. This will give us the idea about the exact amount of water and electricity the farmer would save by using the new technique.”Harmanjeet told the visiting team that he was practisng the technique for the past eight years and had saved 25-30% water as well as electricity.Airi commended the farmer for his initiative and appealed to farmers to do away with the conventional technique and sow paddy directly to save water. “There are around 15 lakh tubwells in the state and their extensive use for irrigation has decreased the groundwater level drastically. Of 138 blocks, 110 are overexploited. In 1984, only 64 blocks were overexploited,” he said. Four of five blocks in the Moga district have already been declared ‘dark zone’ due to overexploitation of groundwater.Paddy sown on 4.5 lakh hectare with DSRAiri said the paddy is expected to be sown on around 27 lakh hectares, including 7 lakh hectares under basmati variety, in the state this season. “So far, 70% of sowing of paddy is over. The crop was sown on 4.5 lakh hectares with the DSR technique,” he added. Brar said the paddy fields with direct sowing method require irrigation once a week while those with traditional methods require irrigation twice a week. Some studies claim that directly seeding also reduces methane emissions and slows down climate change, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/moga-farmer-installs-meter-to-gauge-water-usage-via-direct-paddy-sowing-technique/story-8snMqphUHUtJrpiv2wDlkI.html
29-06-2020||City||Cong’s overseas wing picks Sidhu to address Punjabi diaspora in live series||Seen as having been sidelined in the party’s state unit following a tussle with chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu will address the Punjabi disapora in a live series being facilitated by the Indian Overseas Congress (IOC). The development is being seen as important in the party circles as only Sidhu has been chosen from Punjab for the international contact campaign. Some even see it as an indication of Sidhu’s resurrection as an active leader in politics.He will speak in the #SpeakUpIndia NRI (formerly known as Mera Bharat Mahaan) series aimed at strengthening link with the Indians living abroad, especially those based in the US, Canada and Europe. The session will start at 12.30 AM (IST) on Monday. Indian Overseas Congress president Mohinder Singh Gilzian, in an interview with a web TV channel, said, “He (Amarinder Singh) and Navjot Singh Sidhu are equally important for us. Under this campaign, we are promoting the top Indian leaders who are an inspiration for others.” “There is no denying the fact that Punjabis living abroad are really fond of Sidhu. Also, the NRIs from other states of the country like him. It is the high command’s prerogative to utilise Sidhu’s services,” he added. On March 14, Sidhu, who represents the Amritsar (East) constituency in the state assembly, had launched his YouTube channel ‘Jittega Punjab’ to speak on different issues concerning Punjab and the country. In the videos he has shared on his YouTube channel since its launch, the former Punjab minister makes no bones about his dissent against the Congress government in Punjab. The cricketer-turned-politician had remained incommunicado for long after his removal as local bodies minister of Punjab after the 2019 Lok Sabha elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-s-overseas-wing-picks-sidhu-to-address-punjabi-diaspora-in-live-series/story-MMBbOzpmv8b8fZE5u86HEN.html
29-06-2020||Mumbai||City may witness its lowest June rainfall in 5 years||A lull in rain activity over the past 10 days may lead to deficient rain in Mumbai for June with the possibility of the lowest June rainfall in five years.While Mumbai has so far recorded just over 340 mm rain in June 2020, June rainfall was 515.1 mm in 2019, 792.5 mm in 2018, 523.2 mm in 2017, 695.2 mm in 2016, 1106.7 mm in 2015, according to data from the India Meteorological Department (IMD).During June 2014, Mumbai witnessed its lowest June rain over the past 10 years at 87.3 mm, while the second-lowest was during June 2012 at 298.5 mm. The all-time lowest June rainfall was in 1972 at 0.2 mm followed by 1995 at 82.2 mm. This year, the Santacruz weather station, representative of the suburbs and Mumbai, has so far recorded 344.4 mm rain between June 1 and June 28 (5.30pm), against the normal rain of 449.6 mm or rainfall deficiency of 23%.It will take an additional 148.7 mm rain between Monday and Tuesday for the city to meet its monthly target of 493.1mm average June rainfall). However, the weather bureau has predicted only light to moderate showers for both days but an increase in rain intensity is expected between July 3 and 5.During the same period (June 1 to June 28 5.30pm), Colaba weather observatory, representative of south Mumbai, recorded 389.9 mm rain against the normal rain of 496.5mm, which means rain deficiency of 21.5%.Monsoon onset this year was declared on June 14, two days later than its new normal onset date of June 11. So far there has been only one intense rain spell on June 18 that led to 41 mm rain in the suburbs and 44 mm in south Mumbai.However, Maharashtra from June 1 to June 28 received 219.5 mm rain against the normal for the period at 177.1 mm, which is an excess of 24%.“Significant weather systems did not develop over the west coast of Maharashtra, especially towards Mumbai, that could activate monsoon currents due to the rapid progression of the southwest monsoon over north and northwest India, where onset was declared before the normal arrival dates,” said Mryutunjay Mohapatra, director-general, IMD adding, “However, the performance in July and August is likely to be much better as compared to June as monsoon currents will strengthen over the region.”Last year, monsoon onset over Mumbai was declared on June 25, most delayed in 44 years. However, the city witnessed its first very heavy rain spell as late as June 28 with 234.8 mm rain over 24 hours helping the city surpass its June average rain.Independent meteorologists explained that no significant weather systems formed near north Konkan, including Mumbai, resulting in insufficient moisture convergence and weak westerly winds, resulting in below-normal rains so far for June. “It is not due to cyclone Nisarga, since South Konkan has received above-normal rains. This is the inter-annual variability of monsoon, wherein every year it has a different pattern,” said Professor Sridhar Balasubramanian, department of mechanical engineering and IDP Climate Studies, Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay.Others said south Konkan received more rainfall due to the effect of Cyclone Nisarga and more active monsoon conditions than north Konkan. “The monsoon’s arrival in Mumbai was not that intense, followed by a considerable reduction in the rain due to reduced moisture. Since typical heavy rainfall events were missing for the Mumbai region throughout June, significant rain deficiencies have emerged,” said Akshay Deoras, independent meteorologist and PhD researcher at the University of Reading, United Kingdom.Both, Balasubramaniam and Deoras concurred with the IMD that as monsoon currents moved north, Mumbai rains went into a break phase. “Even though June is likely to end in deficit rains, the outlook for July looks very good with above-normal rains, which is likely to cover this deficit. “This is due to strong westerlies and a formation of an offshore trough near the west coast,” said Balasubramaniam.Deoras said, “Rainfall enhancement is possible after July 2. However, there might be subdued rainfall once again from around July 10 due to another possible break-monsoon scenario.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-may-witness-its-lowest-june-rainfall-in-5-years/story-cviyKhalmNs49ujpOhoYjK.html
29-06-2020||Delhi||No community spread of Covid-19 in Delhi: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Sunday said there is no community transmission of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Delhi, and added that he was confident the Capital would not see 550,000 cases of the disease by July 31, as predicted by the state’s  deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia earlier this month.In an interview to ANI, the Union home minister, who has been monitoring the Covid-19 situation in the national capital, said Sisodia’s comments created “fear” among people, and gave the Centre the cue to step in and coordinate the city’s response to the virus which has infected 83,077 people and killed 2,623 here till Sunday.“Around the second week of June, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that by July 31, there will be 5.50 lakh persons infected with the virus. He that there will be no place left, no beds left and the situation will be difficult. This created a lot of fear in the minds of people in Delhi. His estimate was based on figures. I do not want to go into whether estimate was right or wrong. But a situation of fear arose and some people started mulling an exodus (out of Delhi),” Shah said.“The situation regarding bodies (of Covid-19 victims) in Delhi was grim. Over 350 bodies were pending for last rites. We decided that within two days last rites of bodies will be done as per religion. Today, no body is left for last rites. Now last rituals are conducted same day,” Shah said.The Centre stepped in to manage the virus situation in Delhi on June 14, with Shah holding at least four meetings with central and state agencies so far, and visiting hospitals to assess their preparedness. “…After Manish ji’s remarks, I felt that the central government should not stay idle. Modi ji has accountability towards the country. The PM also told me that the home ministry should take initiative to move forward and help the Delhi government,” he said.The home minister stressed that there is coordination between the Centre and state in tackling Covid-19 in Delhi. “There is coordination...(Delhi CM) Arvind Kejriwal is always kept in the loop. Decisions are taken by involving him also,” he said.Reacting to the home minister’s interview, Sisodia in a statement on Sunday said, “Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal sought help and support of every agency to battle (the) corona (virus disease) in Delhi. We got tremendous support from the central government, religious organisations like Radha Soami Satsang, Akshardham Temple Trust, Terapanthi, various hotels, banquets halls, private hospitals and NGOs like Doctors for U, and others.” He added: “ For increasing testing, we sought central government’s assistance, and they helped us with procuring rapid testing kits. Since then, testing has been increased by four times. The Centre also provided us with oxygen cylinders, ITBP [Indo-Tibetan Border Police] doctors and nurses for Radha Soami Covid centre and guidance from domain experts. “The deputy CM himself hoped that the estimate of 5.5 lakh cases by the end of July would prove wrong and pointed out that the recovery rate in Delhi is now 62%. “We are hopeful that situation will improve in the coming weeks and will certainly not be as bleak as it looked in first week of June when domain experts predicted 5.5 lakh cases in Delhi by July 31.” Shah said a series of steps have been taken to stem the spread of the virus and ramp up medical facilities.“…I can say now with confidence that situation of 5.5 lakh cases will not come on July 31,” Shah said. He added that the situation would be in control by July 31 because the government has focussed on taking preventive steps, including more tests and contact tracing.“The evidence for or against community transmission in Delhi will come from the sero survey that has started in the city, and will be completed in next two weeks or so. It will be too premature to say anything before the results of the survey are out,” says Dr Sanjay K Rai, professor, centre for community medicine, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.Shah also referred to the Delhi government’s decision to reserve hospitals, except those run by the Centre, for residents of Delhi — which was overturned by Lieutenant Governor Baijal — and said it was untenable.“I am also from outside Delhi. Where will I go, if something happens to me? Delhi is the capital of the country. And people from different states stay here, come and go,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-community-spread-of-covid-19-in-delhi-amit-shah/story-QzBvyxS9jZoOBStuenTx5H.html
29-06-2020||Mumbai||Maha sees sharpest one-day case spike for 5th day in a row||The state on Sunday, for the fifth day in a row, recorded its sharpest single-day jump in Covid-19 cases with 5,493 more infections, even as chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said that the ongoing lockdown would not be lifted after June 30. The state case count went up to 164,626 and toll rose to 7,429 with the addition of 156 deaths on Sunday. Mumbai saw 1,287 more infections on Sunday, taking its total to 75,539. With the addition of 87 deaths, the toll of the city is 4,371. The state health department has, however, said that 60 of the fatalities added on Sunday were reported in the past two days, while the remaining 96 are from the past few weeks. Thackeray, who completed seven months as the CM on Sunday, said the ongoing lockdown will not be lifted after its fifth phase ends on June 30, although the government was mulling more relaxations under its ‘Mission Begin Again’ — a staggered plan to lift curbs.Thackeray said that as the government is opening up activities in a calibrated manner, cases are expected to rise in the coming days. Thackeray, in his address through Facebook live, said that the risk of Covid-19 and the battle against the virus has not passed yet, but the government is relaxing curbs in a phased manner. The state government is expected to decide on relaxations in industrial, commercial activities after the Central government issues its guidelines. Thackeray is scheduled to hold high-level meetings with his cabinet colleagues and top officials over the next two days. He also has warned that the government machinery will be forced to impose stricter lockdown curbs again if the guidelines were not followed by people. “I have been getting requests from a few civic authorities for permission to impose stricter lockdown, owing to the rising numbers. There are cases of violations of curbs in some cities such as Mumbai, Pune and even in rural areas. In case of violations of curbs, we will have no option, but to go for stricter imposition of lockdown in areas with rise in cases,” he said.Thackeray said that there will be a spike in infections in the next few weeks. “As we have been opening up activities to ensure the revival of the economy, we have been witnessing a rise in cases. As part of the relaxation, people step out of their homes, come in contact and spread the virus. Even in the near future, there will be a rise in cases as we open up more activities,” he said. State health department expects the rise in cases during July and August. “There will be a modulating trend in terms of cases for the next few weeks, before we expect the plateau in August,” the official said, requesting anonymity. After allowing salons and beauty parlours to open from Sunday in the fourth phase of Mission Begin Again, the state government is expected to extend more relaxations in transport facilities and industrial operations. It has also hinted at allowing more workforce in private and even government offices. State has been reporting more than 5,000 cases a day for the past three days. It has seen 32, 551 cases and 1,259 deaths in the past seven days, with a daily average of 4,650 cases and 180 deaths respectively. Mumbai’s growth of cases has comparatively improved as it reported 9,051 cases and 700 deaths during this period. State’s case fatality rate (CFR) dropped to 4.51% from 4.69% on June 16, the day on which there was an addition of 1,328 deaths as part of the reconciliation of data. The CFR was 3.79% on June 15. The recovery rate of the state has improved to 52.59% as 86,575 patients were reported to have recovered from the infection. Thackeray said that the state government is ready to take on the surge. “We have increased testing facilities. Instead of waiting for the virus to attack us, we have been chasing it. After it has proven successful in Mumbai, the ‘chase the virus’ drive is being implemented elsewhere in the state. It will help us in containing the spread. The government has received permission from the Centre for the use of remdesivir and favipiravin, the antiviral drugs, and they will be made available to citizens free of cost once adequate stock is procured,” he said. Thackeray said that the government was inaugurating plasma therapy testing centres in Maharashtra on Monday and it will, perhaps, help us Maharashtra become the top state to provide the facility with the highest number of tests for the therapy. We appeal to people who recovered from the infection to come forward for the test of therapy so that other patients can benefit from them,” he said. The CM also appealed to doctors from the private sector to come forward and guide their colleagues from the healthcare sector to treat patients effectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-sees-sharpest-one-day-case-spike-for-5th-day-in-a-row/story-RNyk6tKHDPZ7lOyZmoGdjP.html
29-06-2020||Mumbai||3,817 trees across tiger corridor to be destroyed?||For construction of the Chandrapur Greenfield airport, the Maharashtra forest department has issued preliminary clearances for tree felling and diversion of forest land at a recognised tiger corridor in Vidarbha.The project would lead to destruction of 3,817 trees and diversion of 75 hectares (ha) forest land (47ha reserved forest and 28ha protected forest) at Vihirgaon and Murti villages in Rajura taluka, an identified tiger corridor by Wildlife Institute of India (WII), Dehradun. The details were revealed after the forest department responded to a right to information (RTI) query filed recently by a wildlife activist. The activist, requesting anonymity, shared documents with HT. WII, which studied the wildlife impact of the project, said the airport would hamper the connectivity of the corridor and result in increased human-wildlife conflict. HT has reviewed WII’s report.Spread across 340ha, the Maharashtra Airport Development Corporation (MADC), appointed as the nodal agency for the project by the state government in 2018, intends to develop the first Greenfield airport in Vidarbha which would cater to Q-400, A-320 and smaller planes. It will accelerate economic development in the region by facilitating swift transportation from different parts of the country, MADC said. The Chandrapur forest department gave its nod in March this year. “The proposal was recommended subject to mitigation measures as proposed by WII, regularisation or compensating encroachments, and compensatory afforestation of 1,000 saplings per hectare at degraded forest land across 76.06ha in Chandrapur,” said SV Ramarao, chief conservator of forests, ChandrapurThe airport site is located in central Chanda, which is 32km from Chaprala Wildlife Sanctuary, 38km from the Tadoba-Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) buffer, and next to the proposed Kanhargaon wildlife sanctuary.WII said the project should be avoided. “The proposed site is known for its wildlife value, especially for tigers and its importance as a connecting corridor. The present site may or shall not be considered for the construction of the proposed airport. It will impact the functional connectivity of the corridor and may result in increased human-wildlife conflict in the district,” read the report by WII.WII had suggested mitigation measures in case there were no alternative sites for the airport. “The most important mitigation measure is for MADC to undertake restoration of 17 forest patches with mixed plantation to ensure connectivity of the corridor,” said a WII researcher.MADC said they received stage I clearance (from state forest department) under the Forest Conservation Act, 1980, and await stage II clearance (from Union environment ministry) before commencing construction. “All clearances from the state have been received. Once the Centre issues final clearance, WII’s mitigation measures will be implemented before commencing construction,” said Deepak Joshi, public relations officer, MADC.However, the state chief wildlife warden denied this. “So far, only the territorial wing has submitted its recommendation. The proposal is with the forest department’s nodal officer. It is yet to be examined by other departments, and will then be sent to the state government. Once the state clears the proposal, stage I clearance will be obtained. At the moment, this has not happened,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife). “The tiger corridor makes the project an extremely sensitive area, and the details have to be examined carefully.”Meanwhile, the project will be developed in two phases. Phase I includes development over 291.37ha, while phase II involves work on 48.57ha. “Land acquisition for the first phase is complete. The second phase will begin soon. The Covid-19 crisis delayed the process of receiving clearances,” said Joshi.Chandrapur district is home to about 170 of the state’s 312 tigers. “The proposed airport area has tiger, leopard, and wild prey occupancy. It will be not only disastrous for wild animals, but also dangerous for civil aviation. Such a site will be rejected as per international civil aviation rules,” said Kishor Rithe, former member of the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-817-trees-across-tiger-corridor-to-be-destroyed/story-Qs6mZRO7PGbQ1aKnKzHbSI.html
29-06-2020||Mumbai||35-year-old cheats, rapes 7 women; arrested||Rabale police arrested a 35-year-old sales manager of a private firm for allegedly cheating at least seven women by targeting them through matrimonial websites, establishing sexual relations with them and then refusing to marry them. The accused, who is already married and has a child, allegedly forced a few women to terminate their pregnancies, said police. He was produced before the holiday court on Sunday and has been remanded in police custody till July 1. The accused, Sachin Sambre-Patil, a 35-year-old from Thane, has married twice, the first in 2014 and the second in 2017, and has a son aged one-and-a-half year with his second wife, police sources said.The accused has been on the matrimonial website since 2015 and has been targeting women using different profiles. Sometimes, he would use Sachin Sambre and other times used Sachin Patil for his profile, said police.“The accused would register himself as a divorcee or in some cases as a bachelor. He has targeted at least seven women so far including an IT engineer, doctor, advocate and one from the police department. Currently, only a woman advocate has submitted a complaint to the police against him,” said a police officer adding that they are waiting for the other women to step forward and file complaints.After winning their trust, Sambre-Patil would meet the women and get into sexual relationship with them by promising marriage. In some cases, he also forced the women to get abortion when they got pregnant.A Rabale-based advocate, who was forced to undergo abortion, recently learnt that the accused is already married and filed a complaint with the police.Following the complaint, Rabale police have registered a case of rape and cheating against Sambre-Patil.

The objections were raised by the director general’s office after an inspection in January and February 2020.In a report accessed by Hindustan Times, the director general states that “as there was no requirement of funds lying unspent amounting to Rs13.96 crore and Rs2.97 crore for the financial year 2017-2018 and 2018-2019 respectively, hence the authorities withdrew the funds at the fag end and disbursed to the respective aided colleges.”This “irregular retention of Rs16.93 crore outside the government account” through “fixed deposit” was against the Central government account (receipts and payments) rules governing financial matters of UT, read the report.Rule 100 (2) of the same outlines: “No money shall be drawn from government account unless it is required for immediate disbursement.” It adds: “It is not permissible to draw money from government account in anticipation of demands or to prevent the lapse of budget grants.”The report mentions that during the test check of records at the office of the director higher education (DHE) for the financial years 2017-2018 and 2018-2019, it was found that the funds were released in March, each year, “on account of ‘advance’ grant in aid to meet the expenditure on 95% deficit for the next financial year.”Funds ranging from Rs46 lakh to Rs4 crore were distributed to all the private aided colleges of Chandigarh.Pawan Kumar Sharma, principal of DAV College, Sector 10, said he was not aware if the institute was given a special grant, adding, “We availed the grants as per the directions of the UT education department. “We availed what we were granted as grant-in-aid for colleges that the government pays, which is 95% of the deficit amount,” said Nisha Bhargava, principal of MCM DAV College, Sector 36.Confirming that payments were made, Balraj Thapar, principal of Goswami Ganesh Dutta Sanatan Dharma College in Sector 32 said, “I was not the principal at that time, it was Bhushan Sharma. I am told that this was advance grant paid to us which was later adjusted.”The audit report also mentions that no reply was furnished by the education department when the “lapse” was pointed out. When asked to comment, Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director, higher education (DHE), said “We will take it up with the audit department and also constitute an internal committee to look into the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/audit-objections-over-chandigarh-education-dept-s-17-crore-fund-disbursal-to-colleges/story-2DkISQI9b2r6sQwfnDv6AK.html
29-06-2020||City||Out of work, Delhi govt guest teacher stitches PPE kits to make ends meet||New Delhi: Surender Saini, who worked as a Hindi teacher on contractual basis in a government school in north-west Delhi till May 8, has been stitching Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits for the past one month to make ends meet.The 35-year-old was among many guest teachers working on contractual basis in schools run by the Delhi government. Many like Saini, who were paid on a daily basis, have been forced to look for alternative modes of livelihood after being rendered out of work, as schools remain closed due to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic. Schools in the National Capital are shut till July 31, as per the latest Delhi government orders.Before lockdown, which was put in place on March 25, more than 20,000 guest teachers had been employed in 1,030 government schools across the city and were paid between Rs 1,040 and Rs 1,400 per day. Their contracts are renewed every year. On May 5, the Delhi government’s education department issued an order stating, “All guest teachers shall be paid up to May 8, 2020, and in summer vacation only if they are called for duties”. This time, however, no guest teacher has been called back for duty as schools are shut amid the pandemic. Saini, who is differently-abled from his right leg, was working at the Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya (evening) in Nithari Village near Nangloi as a Hindi teacher till May 8. He has a Master’s degree in Hindi as well as a BEd, and has cleared the Central Teacher Eligibility Test (CTET).“I had to return to my home in Rajasthan’s Neemrana district after we were relieved from work. I had to find some work to feed my family of five. I can’t do physical labour either because of my leg. Finally I got work in a PPE kit factory here” he said.He now earns Rs 200 to Rs 250 per day. “As a guest teacher I earned Rs 1,400 per day after six hours of duty. Now, I barely make Rs 200-250 even after working for eight hours. I don’t know for how long I will have to do this since the schools are now closed till July 31,” he said.HT had first reported on June 23 how guest teachers, who were earlier employed in Delhi government schools, were forced to find alternative livelihoods such as selling vegetables and repairing bicycle punctures, after their services were terminated in view of schools being closed.When contacted, Binay Bhushan, director, Directorate of Education (DoE) said that “the guest teachers will be called back to work when their duties will be required.”Shoeb Rana, president of the all-India guest teachers’ association, said all guest teachers should be given salaries from July 1. “As per the Disaster Management Act, the government cannot remove anyone from the job. The government should pay us salaries from July 1 and give us work. The government should also continue employing non CTET teachers till their exam takes place this year,” he said.The contracts of around 1,000 teachers were not extended after March 31 as they have not cleared the mandatory CTET. The test is generally conducted twice a year and was next scheduled for July 5. However, the CBSE, which conducts the test, announced June 25 the postponement of the test till further orders in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.The Delhi government’s norms make it mandatory for its teachers to qualify CTET. A senior government official, requesting anonymity, said, “The Delhi government cannot change the norms of hiring teachers. It’s mandatory to clear CTET for teaching jobs in Delhi government schools.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/out-of-work-delhi-govt-guest-teacher-stitches-ppe-kits-to-make-ends-meet/story-gGZ7I47ZPqH70apLz9dk6K.html
29-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt to add 100 more ICU beds in Lok Nayak Hospital||The Delhi government is likely to add 100 intensive care unit (ICU) beds in Lok Nayak Hospital, central Delhi—the city government’s biggest Covid-19-dedicated hospital—taking the total number to 200, a senior government official said on Sunday.Data compiled by the Delhi government on Sunday showed that out of 5,777 Covid-19 patients who have been admitted to the hospital so far, 4,169 have recovered.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“We increased the number of ICU beds in the hospital from 64 to 100 earlier this month. A hundred additional ICU beds will be added very soon,” said the official cited above on condition of anonymity, adding that the hospital already has 80 ventilators and 2,000 beds, of which 384 have oxygen support.On Sunday evening, more than 1,300 of the 2,000 beds in the hospital were vacant, showed the government’s real-time Delhi Corona app.In the last three months, the hospital has also witnessed 114 successful child deliveries and 1,130 dialysis sessions of Covid-19 patients.“In most cases of childbirth, we found the babies to not be infected by Covid-19,” said the senior government official mentioned above.In June, the hospital witnessed a 50% drop in deaths, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said in a digital press briefing last week, attributing it to plasma therapy trials. Data compiled by the government on Sunday showed that the hospital witnessed 51 deaths in the week between June 20 and 26, as against 100 deaths recorded between June 6 and 12.The hospital has already administered 29 plasma trials in the first phase, according to government records, and received the central government’s approval for 200 more. “As most serious patients were admitted to Lok Nayak Hospital or have been transferred here, the doctors and nurses have had to face the tough challenge of dealing with the highest number of serious cases. To deal with this crisis, the chief minister had advocated the use of plasma therapy in April itself, at a time when this therapy was still being considered as a possible approach to treat serious Covid-19 patients in the country,” said a Delhi government spokesperson.In the last few weeks, the hospital has also witnessed additional facilities, such as the setting up of a special helpdesk personally monitored by the chief minister’s office and a video calling facility through tablets that enables patients to communicate with their relatives. Many relatives had complained that they had lost contact with patients after they had been admitted to the hospital. Also, rules do not allow non-medical hospital staff to enter the Covid-19 wards.A 100-bed Covid-19 health centre set up in a banquet hall in central Delhi has also been attached to Lok Nayak Hospital now.The government has also set up a team entrusted with calling up every admitted patient in the hospital everyday to enquire about their health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-add-100-more-icu-beds-in-lok-nayak-hospital/story-erigHPjliAyf8x7ZaFUamO.html
29-06-2020||Delhi||With Delhi schools set to reopen online, students set to face fight to stay connected||With schools in the national capital to remain closed till July 31 in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, students from economically weaker families continue to stare at an uncertain future in the absence of devices and Internet connections to help them learn through online education. While many parents, whose children could not attend online classes before the summer break, said they are trying to arrange devices now, some said they won’t be able to do so due to financial constraints and the challenges they have been facing since the lockdown. The schools will start virtual education and impart lessons online from the first week of July. Malkeet Singh, a resident of Tilak Nagar, has been out of work ever since the nationwide lockdown was announced in March to curb the spread of the spread of Covid-19. His daughter (7) and son (11), have not attended any online class since the academic session began online in April. His children are enrolled in two private schools in Rajouri Garden and Paschim Vihar — in Class 2 and Class 6 respectively — under the Economically Weaker Section (EWS) quota.Singh, who was working as a contractual driver in a private firm, said that he has requested some of his friends to help him buy a used smartphone now. “I have been out of work since March. We were thinking that schools would resume physical classes by July and our kids would be able to start attending their lessons. But due to the prevailing situation, it is unlikely that schools will reopen even after July. We are standing where we were in March. We still don’t know what to do. I have asked my friends for some financial help to buy a phone for them to study when the schools reopen (virtually) now,” he said. Singh is not alone. There are several like him who lost their jobs during the pandemic or are not making enough even after resuming their jobs. They now cannot provide their children with devices such as smartphones, laptops or tablets ever since the lockdown came into force. Schools in Delhi have been shut since March 19, though they have switched to online learning by conducting classes via video conferencing and sharing study material on WhatsApp groups. Both the government and private schools closed for summer break between May 15 and June 30. The government on Friday announced that all schools would continue to remain closed till July 31 and online classes would resume by the first week of July. Some private schools have already resumed online classes after the break.Lakshman (who goes only by his first name), a carpenter in Punjabi Bagh, said that he has not got any work despite the lockdown being lifted. His son, a Class 2 student enrolled in a private school under the EWS quota, has not been able to attend any online class yet since they don’t have a smartphone at home. “I am a labourer and I make sofas for contractors. No one wants to call us home for work fearing infection. Even if I buy a smartphone by taking some loan, I won’t be able to afford the Internet packages. I have to feed the family first. I seriously fear my son will lose an academic year to the pandemic. He has already missed the internal exams held online in May,” he said.Justice for All, an educational NGO, had, in May, filed a petition in the Delhi High Court demanding free devices for EWS students amid the lockdown. Responding to a notice issued by the court, the Delhi government’s Directorate of Education (DoE) had said that it was the responsibility of private schools to provide devices and Internet facilities to their students. However, schools have maintained that they are not obliged to do that. The matter is still sub-judice.The principal of a private school in south Delhi said on condition of anonymity, “It’s the duty of the state and central governments to provide the said equipment to the schools. Then the schools will provide them to their students. We cannot provide them to all students. Schools are under immense financial crises since the fee collection has dropped drastically amid the pandemic.”Similarly, thousands of students enrolled in government schools in Delhi also can not attend online classes or access e-learning material due to the logistical challenges. HT had, on June 19, reported that only 58.5% students enrolled in Delhi government schools could access e-learning in the months of April and May. Many government school students are also worried about online classes being resumed the first week of July. Ajay Kumar, a Class 12 student at Government Boys’ Senior Secondary School in northeast Delhi’s Karawal Nagar, said, “I could not attend any online class. The school would send links of uploaded lessons via SMS but I do not have a smartphone or laptop at home. I would visit a neighbour’s house to watch the lessons on their phones. I do not know for how long it will continue now. I had never imagined that I would have to study like this in the last year of schooling.”Binay Bhushan, the director of the DoE, said that the department has sought details of students who do not have access to devices and the Internet from all its schools. “We are planning to come up with a wider plan to cover most students from July. The government will soon unveil a plan to impart e-learning till the schools resume physically,” he said.Khagesh Jha, a lawyer and the president of Justice for All said that there was a need to change the curriculum this year in view of the unprecedented situation. “The government first should make online learning optional in both public and private schools. They should assure parents that these classes will be held offline once the situation normalises. It will bring a lot of relief for parents who are under immense pressure amid the pandemic,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/with-schools-set-to-reopen-online-students-set-to-face-fight-to-stay-connected/story-67PMmRzxrIhTr2pv1bmMsM.html
29-06-2020||Noida||Locust threat still looms over GB Nagar, district to remain on alert for July||A day after Gautam Budh Nagar had a close shave from an attack of desert locusts, another swarm of the menacing crop-eating pests passed around the district on its way to Aligarh. While the locusts’ columns did not enter the city on Sunday, officials believe that the threat of an attack by the insects is not completely over and they will continue to stay alert at least for the entire month of July. Favourable wind direction prevented the locusts— who had come from Palwal, in Haryana—from entering the city on Sunday, officials said, adding that with the current environmental conditions– high moisture and incessant rains— another swarm may enter the region soon.“Favourable winds and timing saved the day for Noida on Saturday, and on Sunday another swarm was outside the city doors, but because of the winds, the locusts did not enter the city and rather flew around it on their way to Aligarh,” said AN Mishra, deputy director, department of agriculture, Gautam Budh Nagar. “Since this is the favourable season for the locusts, they might enter the city again. We are on alert and will stay cautious for the month of July at least. The villagers have been cautioned, and have also formed WhatsApp groups to keep them updated. ,” said Mishra.He added that locusts attacks have been categorised as ‘disasters’ and thus, the losses incurred to the farmers, if any, would be liable for compensation. An invasion by locusts can flatten whole farms overnight. The country has been battling locusts invasion since they first entered parts of Rajasthan in April.“Even though the chances are less, more locust swarms may come into the region. Local teams will thus have to stay on alert for at least a month or two. However, if Rajasthan sees good rainfall, there is also a chance that they may settle there as these pests seek green vegetation,” said KL Gujjar, deputy director, Locust Warning Organisation (LWO). On Saturday, a large swarm of the locusts had entered the city during afternoon hours from Faridabad, flew over some of the district’s villages, made a pit stop at Muhamadour Jadaun village and later entered the Bulandshahr district.“The swarm of locusts that left the city yesterday had settled in the Aligarh region. On Saturday it made a pit stop at Muhammadpur Jadaun village, but the teams and the villagers were already ready and they were shooed away by making loud noises. But if they settle during the night time, we would require insecticide to tackle them,” said Mishra.The district administration had raised alarm on Saturday asking the district level locust control team— constituted in May as a precautionary measure following the outbreak in Rajasthan— to take adequate measures including using insecticides like malathion and chlorpyrifos on the pests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/locust-threat-still-looms-over-gautam-budh-nagar-district-to-remain-on-alert-for-july/story-62wTMu0jii130irCN9CYoI.html
29-06-2020||Noida||Noida: ₹ 5,000 penalty for dumping used masks, gloves at undesignated places||Noida authority on Sunday announced a ₹5,000 penalty on anyone found dumping used masks, gloves or personal protective equipment (PPE) at any place other than the designated disposal centres in the city. On April 8, the Uttar Pradesh government had made wearing mask compulsory while outside to prevent the spread of Covid-19 infection. The next day, the Noida authority appealed to residents to hand over used masks to the agency staff that is collecting waste from households. Even after repeated appeals many people continued dump their masks or gloves, which are hazardous waste, anywhere at their will, thereby creating risk to others, said officials. This prompted the authority to warn of the penalty.“We can fine only if we see anyone dumping the used mask or gloves. So far we have not imposed any penalty against anyone for the dumping used mask or gloves at undesignated places. But if we catch anyone doing so, there will be a ₹5,000 penalty. We need everybody’s support to ensure used masks are dumped in black coloured dustbins only so that these are treated scientifically,” said SC Mishra senior project engineer of the Noida authority heading the health department. Noida generates 25 kg waste daily that consists of used masks, gloves and PPE kits. A private agency was tasked with collecting the waste in black dustbins placed in vehicles that go door-to-door. “This hazardous waste is collected from all sectors and stored at a sector 25 facility. From sector 25, another private agency that handles hazardous waste transports the same to a Meerut based facility that treats this scientifically as per rules,” said Mishra.“We have requested that people should first sanitize the mask or gloves and wrap it in a paper before handing over the same to those, who collect it. We should do our duties responsibly so that everybody stays safe from infection during this tough time,” said PS Jain president of confederation of Delhi-NCR RWAs (CONRWA), an umbrella body of RWAs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-5-000-penalty-for-dumping-used-masks-gloves-at-undesignated-places/story-CIPb4nudEI6XKsLB2DblnL.html
29-06-2020||Pune||Salons, beauty parlours reopen after three months; rates go up||After a gap of three months, salons and barber shops reopened for business in non-containment zones in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad. However, customers’ relief was short lived, as most salons and parlours had increased the rate of their services, considering the financial burden they faced due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The Maharashtra government had permitted barber shops, salons and beauty parlours to resume operations from June 28 in the state, under its Mission Begin Again, unlock plan.Shop owners maintained that the rates had been increased considering the additional safety measures introduced at the premises in the light of pandemic as per government regulations.On the first day, most appointments were only for haircuts and hair colour as skin-related services have still not been allowed by the government. “Only select services such as haircut, dyeing hair, threading are allowed. Skin related services will not be permitted presently. This should prominently be displayed in the shops,” read an order from the state government.“Government’s decision has provided us a big relief. I assure the state government that all guidelines will be followed by salons and beauty centres. We will take care of each customer’s safety,” said Ganesh Walunjkar, working president of Maharashtra Nabhik Mahamandal.The customers in parlours are given a kit, which includes disposable spatula, gloves, mask, disposable shower caps, gowns, bedsheets and slippers. Owners will be sanitising their premises five to six times a day, he added.Leena Khandekar, founder and director, Lee’s Beauty Centre and Spa, Nal Stop, said that although the first day (Sunday) saw less number of customers, the footfall will eventually increase. “We started our parlour at 10am and were open till 5pm. Till 3pm, I had three appointments – two for haircuts and one for hair colour. We are following all precautions and wearing masks and gloves,” said Khandekar who has not increased the rates at her centre.“I will continue with the same rates which we had before the lockdown,” added Khandekar.Parlours and salons were also seen introducing temperature checks for staffers and clients. “Our staff has been given disposable aprons and hand gloves. Special training has been provided to our staff about all the precautions. Scissors and machines will be sterilized in the UV sterilizers,” added Khandekar who also has one more centre at Karvenagar.“We can do 15 haircuts at the same time, but now we are allowing only four customers following social distancing norms. I am only employing four members at work currently. My staff will continue to work on a rotational basis till the situation becomes normal,” added Khandekar.Appointment are taken using digital forms and payment modes will be also digital.Sangita Sutar, owner, Herbal Beauty Centre, Shahu Colony, Karvenagar, said, “I am yet to start my beauty centre and will resume operations in the next few days taking into account all the precautionary measures listed by the government.”For men too, haircut rates have been increased to Rs 200 from Rs 80-100 earlier, while other rates will be decided after the government allows other services.“Only haircut is allowed as of now, so we have not come out with a new rate card. I was charging Rs 100 for a haircut earlier and now, I will be charging Rs200. For my shop, I have not given out prior appointments and customers are served on first come first served basis,” said owner of Hair Affair, men’s parlour, Ramkrishna Pramhans Nagar, Kothrud.Sayali Karandkar, a salon customer said, “My haircut was pending for a long time. I was mentally prepared to pay a higher price so it did not shock me to pay 100 rupees extra.”Another customer, Kalyani Sakhare said beauticians have suffered a lot during lockdown. “I think we should support them. I am happy to get my hair cut,” Sakhare said.

29-06-2020||Pune||Trains, flights taking more passengers out of city than those arriving back||After lockdown, more people seem to have exited Pune through air and rail services amid a surging Covid tally, which on Sunday reached 16,125 positive cases with a total of 613 deaths in the city.According to data available with airport authorities, as many as 71,496 passengers departed Pune while 41,530 people arrived in Pune during a span of one month after May 25, when civic aviation ministry resumed flight operations in the country. As many as 618 flights arrived in the city while the same number of flights departed.On the other hand, around 22,000 people – mostly migrant workers – have returned to the city as against 37,800 leaving on the Pune-Danapur express, the only train starting from Pune after railways resumed partial operations on June 2. Passengers exiting the city by Shramik trains, a special service run by railways, are not included in this. The district administration dispatched around 1.25 lakh migrant workers through 100 trains and buses. “There are average 1,350 boarding Pune-Danapur express daily. The number of passengers arriving at Pune station by the same train is comparatively less,” said Pune Railway Division spokesperson.According to district collector Naval Kishore Ram, Pune is a hub of education and industry, people from various sectors and students, their parents, businessmen, labourers and have exited city by flights and trains.After declaration of a pan India lockdown by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, all flight operations were stopped since March 25. The Airport Authority of India (AAI) gave its permission to resume flight operations on May 25 after which flights started to Delhi, Bangalore, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Prayagraj and Udaipur cities from Pune.Lohegaon Airport Director Kuldeep Singh said “A total of 1.13 lakh passengers travelled through the airport during the past one month. The number of outgoing passengers is high when compared with incoming passengers during the Coronavirus period. Those passengers like students, businessman and other professionals seeking employment opportunities are higher in number in the arrivals category. We are following all the social distancing norms and guidelines issued by the government for passenger safety,” he said.He explained that medical teams were on duty to cater to the incoming and outgoing passenger traffic at the airport and the authorities were being assisted b by Customs and Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel in their transport duties.Ram said, “Those who were desperate to leave city went during lockdown only. Now people going through regular train are those with regular work purpose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/trains-flights-taking-more-passengers-out-of-city-than-those-arriving-back/story-xLrrdzHhuUqRBGG20L4daM.html
29-06-2020||Pune||Agressive testing has Pune Covid doubling rate at 17.6 days||The doubling rate of Covid-19 cases in the city has been revised to 17.6 days as against the June 19 forecast of 24 days by the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC).The city has been reporting a drastic rise in the number of Covid-19 positive cases for one week with the highest number of positive cases within 24 hours reported on Saturday. The city registered 822 fresh positive cases on June 27 taking the progressive positive count in the city to 15,602.This has led to an increase in the city’s doubling rate and a reduction in the number of days it takes to double the cases. Two weeks ago, Pune’s doubling rate had shown some signs of improvement.Additional Municipal Commissioner, Rubal Agarwal said, “We had estimated the doubling rate to be around 24 days when we were testing about 2,000 samples per day but now we have increased the test sample from 2,000 to 3,500 and so the number of cases has also gone up drastically. So it is only because of aggressive tracing and testing. If the number of active cases goes up, the doubling rate will also be affected.” The city reported over 500 cases within 24 hours for at least three times in the past one week which has led to a drastic rise in the number of active cases which has also reduced the doubling rate of the city.The city’s active cases have gone up from 2,528 as of June 10 to 5,892 on June 27. The proportion of active cases currently stands at 37.7 per cent to progressive positive cases which were 30 per cent as of June 10.The rise in the number of cases also shot up the graph of active cases which had flattened in the early week of June.The graph is now moving upwards thereby putting in pressure on the health infrastructure and civic administration.Dr Sanjay Dabhade from Jan Aarogya Manch, an NGO that works for public health said, “PMC’s poor tracing and testing is now resulting in the spread of the virus and causing more people to be infected. More testing at the right time followed by isolation and quarantine would have resulted in containing the spread of the virus. Also as time passes we are seeing that the fear of the infection is reducing. I was at market yard two days ago when I saw only 30 per cent of people wearing masks. The study by Lancet recommends wearing three-layered masks to contain the spread of the virus. The PMC must continue to create awareness and take strict measures against people not wearing masks in public places.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/agressive-testing-has-pune-covid-doubling-rate-at-17-6-days/story-dLGm3OwDhAlQSdmHGFpouL.html
29-06-2020||Chandigarh||Cong lies on end of MSP exposed after assurance from Tomar: SAD||The Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) on Sunday said the Congress party’s lies about the end of MSP had been exposed with Union agriculture minister NS Tomar announcing for the third time that the MSP and assured procurement of paddy and wheat would stay.In a statement here, former minister Daljit Singh Cheema said that with the announcement, the resolution by the Congress, Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and other political leaders on the all-party meeting last week stands infructuous.“With the Union agriculture minister making it clear that there would be no change in the MSP regime and procurement of foodgrains, the Congress party is in no position to carry on the lies to befool the farmers,” said Cheema.He added that it doesn’t behove of a chief minister to leave aside facts and rely on emotional appeals to force the opposition to believe the propaganda being spun by him.“SAD president Sukhbir Singh Badal presented irrefutable facts at the all-party meeting to prove that MSP and assured procurement would continue. The CM and state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar had no answer to these assertions and have now started falling back on emotional appeals to sustain their mischievous claims,” said Cheema.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-lies-on-end-of-msp-exposed-after-assurance-from-tomar-sad/story-qQ3QpUysZfMpug4RoLVKIO.html
29-06-2020||Pune||Pune-based ZSI scientist claims discovery of new moth sub-species||A scientist of the Zoological Survey of India (ZSI) has claimed to find the sub-species of a moth which was first discovered in Isreal in 2005. Upon further studies, the discovery of the sub-species could add to the 11 kinds of species known so far in the Olepa genus.“The species of Olepa moth are important as the larvae of the moths feed on various economically important crops like cotton, castor, sunflower, sesame, maize, ivy gourd, brinjal, sweet potato, banana, among others. Most of the species are morphologically cryptic (difficult to identify) and complex which hinders the taxonomic documentation process in deciphering the actual species diversity of the genus Olepa,” said Dr Aparna Kalawate, Scientist D at ZSI, Pune, in a written statement.The newly found moth is a sub-species has been named as Olepa Schleini Chandrai after the head scientist of ZSI, Dr Chandra.“I started working on moths around five-six years ago. I had collected samples in 2016, 2017, and 2019. I got series of olepa specimen. One of my specimens from Nandurbar matched exactly with Olepa Schleini while the one collected from Palghar showed a slight variation. Therefore, we put it though mitochondrial DNA barcoding and found 0.6% difference,” said Dr Kalawate.The first of the genus kind was discovered in 1980. However, the genus now has 11 different species - one of which was discovered in the Mediterranean coastal plain of Israel in 2005, according to the research paper about the discovery published in Journal of Threatened Taxa on June 26.“In such phylogenetic studies, numbers are arbitrary. If there are some difference, it needs to be studied. In our case, we found two population and one showed difference of 0.6% from the earlier one. Further studies are needed to see if it can be elevated to a new species category,” Dr KP Dinesh, Scientist D, specialising in phylogenetics DNA barcoding, who was a part of the study along with Shital Pawara and A Sahbnam.The geographical difference between India and Israel piqued the scientist’s interest as she found the Israel-based moth in Maharashtra.Once the samples are collected, taxonomic studies are conducted on them. If the studies do not help in identification of the animals, DNA barcoding is conducted, according to the ZSI scientists.“It is heartening to know about this discovery. Every discovery adds to the repertoire of the biodiversity and it’s well-known that the Western ghats are a mine of biodiversity. Generally, a taxonomy needs to be conducted to know the original source of the species or if the species is endemic, a relationship can be established. The more aware we become, the more equipped we will be to save them in-situ. Just the discovery is not enough, their behaviour, cycle, habits, and role in that particular niche also needs to be studied,” said Dr Kalpana Pai, head of Zoology department of Savitribai Phule Pune University, who is an independent expert and not part of the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/pune-based-zsi-scientist-claims-discovery-of-new-moth-sub-species/story-EYRtZPUpKfe0lj1MlPy4xL.html
29-06-2020||Pune||As monsoon hits state, Sangli residents brace for heavy rains||The much-anticipated monsoon has arrived in Maharashtra, but for the residents and administration of the city of Sangli, it is a grim reminder of the deadly floods of 2019 that ravaged most parts of the district.This year, the Covid-19 pandemic has added to the pre-existing fear of heavy rainfall and the ability of local administration to help those with limited to no means of survival.Last year, 43,043 houses and 1.25 lakh people living in Sangli city were affected, according to Nitin Kapadnis, commissioner of Sangli, Miraj, Kupwad municipal corporations.“We have made announcements through social media and local news channels, asking residents to evacuate when the water level crosses 25 feet as that is when it entered houses last year. We will install displays in every area, as a warning, if and when the water starts rising,” said Kapadnis.People have either turned to their relatives in other villages or started booking rooms on rent in nearby areas like Vijaynagar, Kupwad, and Miraj.“We do have temporary shelters planned in government schools and if need be, local wedding halls will also be roped in. But even so, with social distancing norms in place, we can accommodate around 15,000 people,” said Kapadnis.The residents in low-lying areas are bracing themselves for a possible impact of monsoon and are aware of the water-level at which they need to start moving. However, the fear of the virus is adding to their anxiety.“We received the notice a couple of weeks ago. The corporation officials had come here to serve the notice. Because of the last year’s experience, it is being used as a preventive measure - emptying houses when the water level hits 20 feet. One of them warned of police action if houses are not empty if and when the water hits 20 feet. The water came to our colony after the Irwin bridge mark crossed 40 feet. And they are asking us to leave at half the mark,” said Dattatray Shinde, a man in 40s, who is into cattle and dairy business. He lives in the Magarmach colony. The colony residents lived the flood days in 2019 in a nearby Ganpati temple last year when floods ravaged the city.“Most of the houses were 15 feet deep under water last year,” he recalls.“Our house is located at a height and the canal water level is clearly visible from here. The corporation officials who came to serve notices installed a camera and a sensor at our house. The water entered our house when it reached 45 feet. They have asked us to leave at 20 feet. They said they will provide for those who have no means at all. We are scared of the virus too,” said Imran Hajilala Mujawar, a resident of Suryavanshi plot, Jamwadi. Mujawar owns a grocery store in the area.“They gave us notice that our houses need to be emptied when the water reaches 20 feet. He told us to get a room or go to our relatives’ places. Everybody is scrambling to find accommodation. The lockdown has cut everyone’s income and the virus is a problem too. What if we go somewhere and the people there are coronavirus positive?” said Shaila Devphule, a resident of Suryavanshi plot who is a housewife with a family of five including two children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-monsoon-hits-maha-sangli-residents-prepare-for-the-worst/story-q7jC7cXsXrsH5tVO7kJf5N.html
