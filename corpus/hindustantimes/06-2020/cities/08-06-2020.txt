08-06-2020||City||Ghaziabad may rope in two private hospitals for paid Covid treatment||Officials of the district health department on Monday said that they have almost finalised modalities for setting up two paid private Covid hospitals, one each in the localities of Vasundhara and Vaishali. The officials said that the two hospitals will provide 160 Covid beds together and will serve the purpose of L1, L2 and L3 category hospitals.“We have almost finalised the modalities for these two hospitals. One private hospital in Vasundhara will have 60 Covid beds, while the other facility in Vaishali will have 100 beds for Covid patients. The two hospitals have ventilator facilities and will provide treatment for L1, L2 and L3 category patients, on a paid basis,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).“They will also cater to a large population from trans-Hindon region where we have seen a number of cases emerging from localities of Vaishali, Khoda, Indirapuram and Vasundhara,” he added.The need for more Covid beds is envisaged after Ghaziabad witnessed a spike in cases in the first week of June. Till June 7, 169 fresh cases were reported in first seven days of the month taking the total number of Covid-19 positive patients to 474.At present, Ghaziabad district has no private hospitals offering paid Covid treatment and the health department is running one hospital each of L1, L2 and L3 categories to deal with the Covid cases.The L1, L2 and L3 category healthcare structure is designed by the UP government. The L1 category hospitals are basic hospitals which deal with normal Covid-19 positive patients while the L2 category hospitals deal with patients having moderate symptoms. The L3 hospitals are identified to deal with patients requiring critical care.When asked about the row over Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s statement that Delhi hospitals are only for local residents, the CMO said, “If any patient from Delhi arrives and shows L1 symptoms, we will ask them to remain in home isolation, as the national capital has allowed home isolation of asymptomatic patients. If they require treatment in L2 or L3 category, we admit them as getting treatment is patient’s right.”On Sunday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced that beds in hospitals functioning under Delhi government and private hospitals – with exception of those providing specialised surgeries in certain fields – will be reserved for people of Delhi till the Covid-19 crisis subsides.On Monday, Delhi Lieutenant Governer Anil Baijal overruled the decision and said that no patient should be denied treatment for not being a resident of Delhi. Baijal impressed upon the state government that the Supreme Court has held in several judgments that right to health is an integral part of right to life.Kejriwal’s decision had drawn strong criticism from residents in Ghaziabad, from where hundreds of patients avail treatment in different hospitals of Delhi government.“It is unfortunate that Delhi CM started his career from Ghaziabad but he chose to ignore the needs of treatment for the local residents here. We are now happy that the L-G of Delhi has overturned his decision,” said VK Mittal, president of Kaushambi apartments RWA.In the meantime, Anil Agrawal, Rajya Sabha MP from UP and also a resident of Ghaziabad, has written to UP chief minister to dedicate some of the floors of Kailash Mansarovar Bhawan, being developed in Indirapuram, for setting up a healthcare facility.“I have written to the UP CM to dedicate upper portion of the building for pilgrims while the lower storeys of the building can be converted to a hospital. This will serve purpose for residents of trans-Hindon as we do not have any government hospital there. This will also be helpful for pilgrims as they will be able to get medical treatment there,” he added.In Ghaziabad, ESIC Hospital in Sahibabad is an L1 category facility where all the 76 beds are fully occupied, while the district hospital at Sanjay Nagar is a L2 category hospital with 100 beds. Another L1 category hospital at Muradnagar has 30 beds, but the facility is currently not operational, health officials said.Another 400 bedded L3 hospital has also started functioning but according to officials only 18 beds there have ventilator facility.The district officials have now contacted private hospitals and asked them for proposals for functioning as L1 hospitals.“Presently we have government facilities for Covid treatment. But we require more beds to deal with the rising number of cases. We have already planned for 4,000 Covid beds, which have been identified and will be reserved for asymptomatic patients. So we have asked for proposal from private hospitals to function as L1 category hospitals. They can also be considered under L2 category if they have proper facilities,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaziabad-may-rope-in-two-private-hospitals-for-paid-covid-treatment/story-quYGVjptbFOfioldcHJvdK.html

08-06-2020||Noida||Noida: 93-year-old Urdu poet Dehlavi beats Covid-19 in seven days||The winning instinct doesn’t seem to have ended for 93-year-old Urdu poet Pandit Anand Mohan Zutshi Gulzar Dehlavi, who beat Covid-19 in just seven days. The veteran poet was found positive for coronavirus on June 1 and was discharged from a private hospital in Greater Noida on June 7 after his report came negative. After being released from Sharda Hospital on Sunday evening, the nonagenarian poet said on Monday that it was the selfless services of the doctors that he has been able to see his family and friends again. Though feeling weak, the veteran poet narrated his war against the deadly virus in his typical romantic style over phone from his residence in Sector 26: “Wo kehte hain ye ghatak teer hai jaan le ke nikalega, main kahta hoon ye meri jaan hai mushkil se nikalegi (They say that the arrow of deadly disease will kill me, I say it’s my life which will not end so easily).”Expressing his gratitude for the round-the-clock care by the doctors of the hospital, Dehlavi said that they have given him a new lease of life. “Once I get completely fit, I’ll certainly invite every staff of the hospital for a dinner,” he said.Dehlavi’s son Anoop Zutshi said that his father is keeping well now. “He is feeling very weak and has some other old-age ailments also. But he is always a fighter as he had also undergone his open heart and brain surgeries a few years ago,” Anoop said, adding that once his father gets fine, he will take him to Pune. Anoop is based at Pune.The spokesperson of Sharda Hospital said that Dehlavi was on 10-litre oxygen at the time of being admitted to the hospital. “Since his position was very critical that time, as per the instructions given by our director, a special team headed by Dr Abhishek Deswal looked after him. Four doctors, in a shift of six hours, were also deputed to monitor his condition all the time in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the isolation ward,” he said.Dr Ashutosh Niranjan, medical superintendent of Sharda Hospital, said that symptomatic treatment of Dehlavi was immediately started. “For three days after the admission, he was kept on life support system and only fluid diets were given to him. But after that, he was shifted to general ward. He was tested negative on Saturday. And, since he was asymptomatic, we discharged him on Sunday. Our staff saw him off with flowers,” said Niranjan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-93-year-old-urdu-poet-dehlavi-beats-covid-19-in-seven-days/story-cLM50yYki8iE3qOWmf9ctK.html
08-06-2020||City||Officials alarmed as Covid-19 cases emerge in new localities of Ghaziabad||Amid the resumption of many commercial activities in the past few weeks, several Covid-19 cases have emerged in some new localities of Ghaziabad. Since June 1, the district has added 197 new Covid-19 cases to its tally, which stood at 502 till Monday. Officials of the district health department said that the virus has spread to some new areas as offices, industrial units, and markets have opened up.According to the officials, in March, the Covid-19 cases were mainly limited to areas of Raj Nagar Extension, Masuri, Pasonda, Bhopra and Loni. But, in April more areas like Indirapuram, Khoda, Vaishali, and Vasundhara, among others, emerged. In May, the majority of cases emerged from Khoda, Indirapuram, Loni, Jhandapur, Shalimar Garden and Sahibabad.However, Covid-19 cases now have started to emerge in localities like Crossings Republik, Naveen Park, Lajpat Nagar, Dundahera, Sain Vihar, Rampuri, Shastri Nagar, Raj Nagar and Maliwara, the officials said, adding that the cases in these localities have come in during the end of May and first week of June.“We now have cases which are also emerging from other smaller localities. This is due to opening up of industrial and commercial activities, such as markets, shops, and offices. We expect that positive cases will rise in June and July as more and more people come in contact due to opening of activities. The number of cases went up sharply in first week of June,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).On Monday, the total number of Covid-19 cases in Ghaziabad reached 502 with addition of 28 more cases. The figure of 502 includes 307 patients discharged so far and 11 deaths. Now, the district has 184 active cases, the officials said.“Two deaths have been included in the list today and total deaths now stand at 11 till June 8. One is related to a 28 year-old-man who died today while other is of a patient who was referred to Meerut Medical College and tested positive there. He had died on June 4 and had complaints of breathlessness. He was from Daulatpura locality,” said Gupta.According to the list of 28 patients on June 8, six are from Khoda, four from Indirapuram, three from Loni and one from Vaishali, besides other cases from different localities in the district. At present, the district has a total of 105 containment zones. “We already have 85 category 1 containment zones and the rest are category 2 containment zones where two or more cases have emerged. Cases have continued from Khoda, Loni, Indirapurm, Vasundhara, etc, and new containment zones will be created as a result of new areas added to the list of positive patients. We have also changed strategy to deal with the new situation and a pilot project has been initiated,” the CMO said.Gupta said that every locality of the city areas is covered under the jurisdiction of 50 different dispensaries and teams comprising about 650 urban social health activists (USHA) and accredited social health activists (ASHA) have been asked to initiate contact tracing and surveillance in their respective areas.“Now, USHA and ASHA workers will go in localities under their jurisdiction areas. They will do house-to-house survey of elderly persons and monitor their blood pressure, sugar levels and oxygen saturation levels. Further, they will also ensure contact tracing of positive patients and distribute hydroxychloroquine tablets,” the CMO added.These workers will also take up sampling of those having flu-like symptoms or severe acute respiratory infection (SARI), the officials said.Meanwhile, Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s principal secretary (health) on Monday said that it is vital to follow preventive measures in urban areas.“There are more cases in western UP areas falling under the Meerut division as activities have opened up and also because of the high population density. So, social distancing and frequent hand wash becomes essential part of daily life. The ‘mohalla nigrani samitis’ should also work actively in urban areas,” Prasad said.The mohalla nigrani samitis were formed in urban areas while the gram nigrani samitis were formed in rural areas to keep track of people under home quarantine and also for information of suspected cases to the government authorities.The Ghaziabad CMO further said, “About 80% of active cases in the district are asymptomatic, but have been identified after contact tracing. So, people in every locality must take all precautions as many of them may not have symptoms. We had two patients in our L3 hospital who were put on ventilator but they could not survive. There are 14 others who are presently on oxygen support.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/officials-alarmed-as-covid-19-cases-emerge-in-new-localities-of-ghaziabad/story-QT5UuTDMW3LVgUe7bhGC0M.html
08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab seeks modification in order allowing schools to collect 70% fee||The Punjab government on Monday sought modification in high court order which had allowed Punjab schools to collect 70% of school fee.It was on May 22 that high court, acting on the plea of Independent Schools’ Association, Chandigarh, with 78-member schools in Punjab and Chandigarh, had allowed schools to charge 70% fee from students for the academic year 2020-21. The court had also allowed schools to charge admission fee in two instalments in six months and further directed that teachers in these schools would have to be paid 70% of their salaries. Subsequently, 3,000 odd other schools too approached the court and were also granted similar relief. The decision resulted in widespread protests by parents in several parts of the state.Acting on the Punjab’s application high court bench of justice Ritu Bahri has sought schools’ response by June 12.State’s advocate General, Atul Nanda told court that most affected party in the case, parents were not before the court. Further, court asked schools to pay 70% salaries to the teachers, which affects teachers’ right to get full salary, he said. “They should also have been impleaded as party.

08-06-2020||City||Gurugram records five Covid deaths in a day, number of cases breaches 2K mark||GurugramThe district on Monday recorded five deaths — the highest single day spike in fatalities due to the virus so far — taking Gurugram’s Covid-19 toll to nine. Health officials said that in all the fresh deaths that were reported age and co-morbid conditions acted as a contributing factor.Gurugram on Monday also recorded 243 new cases of the virus, taking the total count of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus past the 2,000 mark .According to the state health bulletin, 2,165 cases have been so far reported in the city — 1,577 of who are hospitalized and 579 are discharged. As of Monday,, Gurugram’s contribution to Haryana’s Covid-19 burden was nearly 50%. More than 1,100 cases have been reported in the last seven days alone, making it one of the 38 districts in the country with the highest surge in Covid-19 cases.The sudden spike in the cases has also led to reshuffling in the district health department. A senior government official in Chandigarh confirmed that the district’s chief medical officer Jaswant Singh Punia has been transferred. “Orders for his transfer have been issued,” said the official who asked not to be named.Contacted, Punia however said that he was not aware of the development.On Monday, the district’s rapid response team confirmed two elderly patients, aged 85 and 80, had succumbed to Covid-19 in Medeor Hospital. A 56-year-old patient admitted in Park Hospital died due to multiple organ failure, and a 72-year-old succumbed in the same hospital with chronic pancreatitis. A 65-year-old admitted in Max Hospital also was reported to have succumbed to the virus. “In all the= cases, age and co-morbidity has been a contributing factor. This is the highest number of deaths reported in a day,” said Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer. Currently, at least 10 critical patients have been put on ventilator support in three hospitals of the city. It includes four in Medanta and three, each in Fortis and Medeor Hospital, he said. Data shows that in the last one week the infection has rapidly spread in the city. Gurugram had only 903 cases till June 1. However, in the next eight days at least 300 more people contracted the virus. Officials said that the growth rate in the infection has been almost 13% in just the last one week. The growing number of cases also indicates that the percentage of test positivity (the number of cases in ratio to the number of samples tested) in the city has exponentially increased from 3% on May 1 to almost 57% on June 7.The surge in number of cases started from May 28 onwards when 68 cases were reported, taking the total count to 405. The positivity rate was 24% at that time. It drastically increased to 53% on May 29 with 115 new cases. It was also then that for the first time new cases were reported in three-digit figures. Later, it fluctuated between 29% to 47%. With 230 cases reported on Sunday, the test positivity rate reached 57%, highlighting the rapid pace at which the virus is spreading.The Union ministry of health and family welfare on Monday held a meeting with the officials of 38 districts in ten states — Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Haryana, Rajastha, Gujarat, Jammu and Kashmir, Karnataka, Uttarakhand and Madhya Pradesh —witnessing a surge in cases. “We are again starting house-to-house survey for timely detection of cases and also the number of teams will be increased,” said the senior state official.“We are prioritizing high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients. In the meeting, it was discussed how vulnerable population like elderly or those with co-morbidities have to be focused upon to prevent fatality. Active surveillance will continue, testing will be increased and it will be ensured that patient gets the tertiary care as the symptoms escalates,” said a health official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-records-five-covid-deaths-in-a-day-number-of-cases-breaches-2k-mark/story-2FJubaJg8UbJMhoYfDSqbK.html
08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Power tariffs not to change in Haryana till 2021||Electricity tariff in Haryana will continue to remain unchanged for the 2020-21 financial year. As per Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (HERC) order on the power tariff for 2020-21 for the distribution and retail supply, the tariff for domestic consumers consuming up to 100 units per month has also been decreased from Rs 2.70 per unit to Rs 2 per unit if the monthly consumption is up to 50 units and from Rs 4.50 per unit to Rs 2.50 if the monthly consumption is up to 100 units.However, since energy charges in case of domestic consumers are telescopic in nature up to the consumption of 800 units per month, no slab benefit shall be admissible and tariff applicable will be 710 paisa unit for total consumption in case of consumption more than 800 units per month.The two power distribution companies (discoms) – UHBVN and DHBVN submitted that the power sales to industrial and commercial consumers is likely to be affected severely due to the lock down and possible delay in the resumption of full-scale economic activity. These categories have a lower distribution loss as compared to the other categories.As a result of the alteration in the consumption mix, the discoms are expected to incur a higher level of distribution loss as compared to the actual of the previous year instead of the loss reduction as proposed in the original filing. Further, due to COVID-19 lockdown, the vigilance activities and loss reduction activities will also be affected.The revised losses have been projected on the basis of estimated consumption of various major consumer categories.The power regulator in its order said that it has examined the true up for the 2018-19 financial year and the fuel surcharge adjustment (FSA) filings for the 2019-20 of the discoms. FSA is an amount the power distribution companies levy on consumers based on varying price of fuel or coal.“The FSA calculations by the discoms are at times not in accordance with the multi year tariff regulations. The the method and amount of FSA being recovered is not comprehended by the electricity consumers. This may lead to under or over recovery of FSA. Accordingly, the Commission directs the licensees to calculate FSA strictly in accordance with the multi year tariff regulations,’’ th HERC said.The Commission observed that the aggregate technical and commercial loss (AT&C) target of 18.91% and 15.03% for 2020-21 proposed by UHBVN and DHBVN respectively was on the lower side. “Under UDAY scheme Haryana DISCOMs were required to reduce AT&C losses to 15% up to 2018-19 to utilize the central grant but only DHBVN could achieve the target.The HERC directed the distribution companies to reduce AT&C losses of all urban feeders below 25% and rural feeders below 50% in 2020-21. The discoms have been asked to submit detailed action plan to achieve the target within two months of issuance of orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/power-tariffs-not-to-change-in-haryana-till-2021/story-iblgBE8ez1AxI75VLCFuMM.html
08-06-2020||Gurugram||Faced with acute labour shortage, industry owners woo migrants with better wages, sops||Industries in Gurugram and Manesar, which are struggling due to a shortage of labourers, are trying hard to reach out to migrant workers to facilitate their early return. At least 60-70% of the workers have returned to their home towns due to the fear of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. Their absence is forcing some garment exporters to pay higher daily wages to skilled craftsmen, while some others are making calls to their contractors in the villages, promising them better wages and free travel, among other concessions. The real estate developers, who are stuck with ongoing projects, are even ready to pay money in advance, rail tickets, but are still finding it hard to reverse the flow. The market rate for agricultural wages has also gone up due to a shortage of workers, say landowners. The automobile sector, however, is in a comparatively better situation, say vendors. This is because the demand for production is less and the sector has seen relatively fewer migrants return to their home towns. Around 6 to 7 lakh migrant workers in Gurugram, who worked in different sectors, have left the district since the start of the year when the coronavirus pandemic started to make an impact, say local trade union leaders. Due to the large scale migration, the factories in Udyog Vihar, which have resumed operations, are finding it difficult to resume full-scale production. They are being forced to hire labour locally at higher wages or contacting those who have gone home to return as early as possible.The paucity of labour is such that in most of the 1,900 industrial units that have resumed operations are functioning at 40 to 50% of their full capacity, said the Gurugram district administration officials on Monday. “The units which have more than 1,000 workers are mostly operational but the major impact is on export-oriented units where 100 to 200 workers are employed. As of now, only 50% of these units have become operational,” said the labour department officials. As on Monday, only 1.10 lakh labourers have returned to work in the automobile, garment manufacturing and exports, and other industries across the state, they added.Garment industrySatyender Singh, general manager, East-West Exports, a garment export unit based in Udyog Vihar, says that the majority of units are working with 30% of the staff as workers are not available. “Large companies, which have the financial muscle, are now hiring workers on a daily basis and paying them higher than the normal wages. In normal times, ₹360 to ₹400 was paid to a tailor. Now the market rate is ₹400 to ₹450 and money is being paid daily,” he said, adding that in such a scenario, workers are leaving smaller firms and opting to work as daily wagers for larger firms as the money is paid daily in the evening.As per the garment exporters, a large number of companies have either prior orders or have received new orders from Europe that have to be fulfilled on a priority basis. The season in Europe is around August and September and if we don’t work now these orders will get wasted. We are, therefore, contacting our workers to return to work as early as possible. The industry owners are ready to pay for tickets, advance cash and provide for other facilities,” said Manmohan Gaind, vice president, Manesar Industries Welfare Association.Across the National Capital Region(NCR), the labour situation is precarious says Dr Manipadma Datta, vice-chancellor, TERI School of Advanced Studies and the head of the department of business sustainability. “The NCR is staring at a major manpower crisis, which will impact the business in the long run. All stakeholders need to win back the confidence of workers, who need empathy, support and help. They will not return soon and it would be difficult to fill the shop floors,” he said.Real estateThe situation in the real estate sector, which is one of the largest employers and revenue generators in Gurugram, is equally dire as only 21,000 workers, out of an average of 2.5 to 3 lakh workers, are reported to have returned to work on 96 active construction sites, the district administration said.Real estate developers say that at any given time 2.5 to 3 lakh workers are engaged in construction activities and migration has had a major dampening impact on the trade. “We are trying to contact workers through labour contractors, calling them directly and have offered them various concessions. However, only a few of them have responded positively,” said Praveen Jain, vice chairman, National Real Estate Development Council(Nardeco), Haryana, adding that extension of project deadlines by six months needs to be further pushed back by six months. Another developer, who wished not to be named, said that they have approached labour contractors with offers of free rail tickets, air tickets and higher wages but the contractors say that the workers re reluctant to return. “There is fear among the workers as the situation is still fluid and there is no clarity as to how long will the pandemic continue,” he said.Rajender Saroha, joint secretary, Bhawan Nirman Kamgaar Union, who has been actively engaged with workers, says that workforce in the construction sector is feeling abandoned as not many real estate developers took care of them during the lockdown. “Workers are economically and emotionally hurt and will not return soon,” he said.AutomobileAs compared to garment and realty sectors, the automobile sector is faring relatively better, says Ashok Kohli, president, Chamber of Industries, Udyog Vihar. “The auto companies are larger in size and more organised so these were able to retain workers and the demand for labour in this sector is also less as production targets are lower,” he said.In the automobile segment, the labour department said that around 40% labour has returned to work and the situation is likely to improve in the coming days as demand for cars, motorcycles and other such products improves.A vendor, who works for a carmaker, said that they expect the production process to be ramped up in the coming months and likewise the demand for workers will rise. “Right now the auto vendors are comfortable with the present strength as a fewer number of cars and bikes are being produced,” he said, preferring anonymity.AgricultureThe migration of agricultural workers to their home states has made the work of paddy transplantation and sowing of vegetables difficult for the coming season. Deen Mohammed, district horticulture officer, Nuh (an area known for its vegetable production), said that cost of labour has doubled as workers have left. This will impact farm operations in a big way. “Many farmers are leaving their fields fallow. Some are choosing to plant mustard instead of vegetables. This will reduce production and increase the price of vegetables in the coming months,” he said.Satish Yadav, a progressive farmer from village Mankdola, echoed his views and said that almost all farmworkers have left barring those who are permanently employed. “The sowing of paddy crop is going to take a hit across the state and other farm operations will also get affected. The cost of labour has also risen and this will impact farming,” he said.The farmers are now waiting for the situation to return to normalcy as they neither have any agency nor the reach to call back the seasonal farm labourers. “Some of the farmers have tried to reach out to the labourers but nothing concrete has come out of it,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/faced-with-acute-labour-shortage-industry-owners-woo-migrants-with-better-wages-sops/story-Of80ZxC8lgbFgksIC5bjXJ.html
08-06-2020||Gurugram||Majority of parents not in favour of reopening of schools: Report||The district education department on Sunday said that there was a need to review the ever-changing Covid-19 situation and hold further consultations to decide on a time frame to reopen schools instead of on July 1, as decided earlier. The department said that most parents were not in favour of schools reopening at a time when coronavirus cases in the city are on the rise.In a report submitted to the directorate of education, the department also wrote that most stakeholders were in favour of continuing distance/online learning in view of the current situation. The report was prepared by the department based on a discussion with 62 parents, students, teachers and schools representatives that took place on Saturday.During the discussion, most members agreed that the situation could be reviewed again after every 15 days. Some members also suggested that the government could share with schools the standard operating procedure (SOP) so that they can make plans in line with the instructions. They also recommended the reopening of schools in a phased manner.Prior to the meeting, an internal survey was also conducted by the department to take into the views of the participants on the issue of reopening of schools. Around 80% of the participants said that they were not in favour of schools reopening, while 13% opted in favour of partial reopening. Around 65.4% members suggested that schools should be reopened later as per the situation, while 14.8% members opted for August as the month of reopening. Around 12.3% members suggested that schools should open in July.Aparna Erry, principal, DAV Public School, Sector 14, said she had been receiving emails from parents who were worried about an immediate reopening of schools. “Parents want the situation to stabilise before they can send children to schools. They have said that they won’t be sending children to school if they were to reopen in July. The number of coronavirus cases is increasing due to which parents are worried. They will be ready to send children to school only after number of Covid-19 cases come down,” said Erry.During the meeting, most participants from government schools said that maintaining physical distancing in government schools was not feasible with the available infrastructure and facilities in place. Some government school participants said that senior students could be called to school in a staggered manner. Members of private school organisations said that schools in other countries had reopened when the Covid-19 curve started going down, whereas in India, the curve was going up. While members said that online classes could be continued, participants from government schools raised their concerns regarding online classes. Members said that most government schools were struggling with online classes since many students were not equipped with necessary devices and high-speed internet facilities.District education officer Indu Boken said that most schools and parents were not prepared for the reopening of schools. “Members said that they were not ready to send children to school until the Covid-19 graph started flattening. Some students also said that even if the schools were to reopen, parents wouldn’t send them to schools,” said Boken.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/majority-of-parents-not-in-favour-of-reopening-of-schools-report/story-gE7jf0xkBH5IsG3R85A3BL.html
08-06-2020||Gurugram||With domestic help away, residents queue up to purchase dishwashers||Once a rarity in Indian homes, the dishwasher has acquired newfound importance in city households as well as in other urban centres in India. Recently, following the announcement of the lockdown, there has been an exponential rise in its demand, according to those dealing in electronic appliances. In fact, at least four city-based distributors said that there is a shortage of stock in the market, with people signing up on waitlists to purchase a dishwasher and prospective buyers numbering into hundreds in Gurugram.With manual chores becoming a more integral part of the everyday life, residents also that said they were happy to spend money on products to ease cumbersome household tasks, particularly as many are no longer employing household help, either by personal choice or due to neighbourhood or RWA restrictions. “We have all realised that washing dishes can be extremely tedious. Naturally, people will be looking for a more convenient way to get the job done,” said Jugesh Nanda, owner and manager of an electronic goods showroom on Golf Course Road in DLF Phase-1.“Since May 3, we have sold close to 30 dishwashers in the city, and have placed an order for another 30 units. Earlier, I used to sell not more than 25 to 30 dishwashers in a year,” Nanda added. Spokespersons for leading dishwasher brands in India have also publicly spoken of the rise in demand, which stands at between 400 to 500%, as per industry estimates. According to an employee of a leading home appliances company, “Yearly targets on the sale of dishwashers are being met in months, if not weeks. There will be a more concerted marketing push in India for sure.”Vishnu Kumar, 29, who lives by himself in an apartment complex in DLF Phase-2, and who recently purchased a dishwasher, said, “My RWA is not yet allowing domestic help inside. I was paying my help ₹5,000 a month earlier, whereas a dishwasher will end up costing me only ₹3,000 per month on my credit card. It definitely saves a lot of time.” Kumar said, adding that he has been getting by without any domestic help since March 25.Yashasvika Behlani, a resident of a condominium in Sector 30, said, “Our apartment came with a built-in space for a dishwasher, but we never considered it until now. Once the lockdown was eased on May 3, we bought one and it really optimises our time. My partner and I work forIong days, so we tend to rely on gadgets for cooking and cleaning.” Behlani added that her domestic help had chosen to return home to Rajasthan in the days immediately after lockdown. “Out of caution, we are taking care of the housework ourselves for a bit,” she added.Distributors also said there has been a marked shift in the profile of consumers purchasing dishwashers, which usually cost between ₹30,000 to ₹55,000. “Dishwashers have never been an active segment in Indian electronics,” said Ajay Sharma, a licenced distributor for Bosch-Siemens, whose combined share in the Indian dishwasher market stands at close to 50%.“Dishwashers were sold mainly to customers who returned to India, having lived abroad. There is also some demand among expats in Gurugram, but the common perception was that they are not suited to Indian vessels and cooking,” Sharma added. After the lockdown, he said, people who have never used or purchased a dishwasher before are doing so, while several others are considering it.“We get a lot of inquiries these days, particularly from homes where both parents are working,” Sharma said, adding that he has sold close to 60 units in the last month alone, and has at least a 100 people on the waitlist to purchase one. At least three other distributors HT spoke to said they have between 50 to 100 people on similar waitlists.“But there is a shortage due to a disruption in the global supply chain. Most major companies have liquidated whatever stock they had in godowns, and newer imports are uncertain. Unlike washing machines, dishwashers are not manufactured in India,” said Shlok Bansal, an employee of an LG distributor.Multiple distributors HT spoke to also confirmed that there has been an uptick in demand for other electronic goods, such as vacuum cleaners, microwaves, oven-toaster-grills, and hair trimmers. “Most kitchen appliances will also sell well for the next few months. So would juicers, sandwich grills and food processors,” said Nanda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/with-domestic-help-away-residents-queue-up-to-purchase-dishwashers/story-6zqmbhkMlfhTbMLJ83XX0O.html
08-06-2020||Gurugram||Cops monitor CCTV footage to crack down on people not wearing masks||People walking on Gurugram roads without a face mask are likely to be intercepted by a police patrol squad within minutes, as the police have started monitoring live feed of CCTV cameras to identify violators.The police said the decision to monitor the footage of more than 2,000 close-circuit television (CCTV) cameras was taken in view of the rising number of coronavirus cases in the city and after receiving several complaints about people not wearing face masks in public spaces. At present, the number of Covid-19 cases in the Gururgam has surged to 2175. Muhammad Akil, the police commissioner, said that despite regular patrolling and announcements to the public, many are not wearing masks due to which they started this drive to arrest them. “This is an offence where bail is granted at the spot. The offender is penalised by the court,” Akil said. According to the police, 1,278 people have so far been booked under sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Epidemic Act, 1897 and the Haryana Epidemic Disease, Covid-19 Regulations, 2020 for not wearing masks while stepping out of their residences.“Station house officers (SHOs) have been assigned the task to monitor all the CCTV cameras in their area every day and to check how many residents are stepping out without masks,” Akil said.On Monday, the police started monitoring live footage from 350 CCTV cameras at the Integrated Control And Command Centre (I-CCC), which is being used as a designated war room for Covid-19 surveillance. Akil said they are also monitoring CCTV cameras installed in residential complexes to monitor the movement of people and violations, if any.The police will monitor footage from the 2,000-odd cameras installed in residential societies, commercial hubs and in open spaces from 6am to 8pm. Upon spotting a person not wearing a mask, the staff monitoring the footage will send an alert and a screen shot of the footage to the police control room (PCR) vehicles. The crime units will also assist in tracking the unidentified violators.“Two policeman will be stationed in areas, such as condominiums, markets and commercial towers, facing the main road and monitoring live feed of the CCTV cameras. We have identified nearly 1,300 spots while 700 are pending,” said Akil.The police said they have distributed more than 500,000 face masks during the lockdown period and have asked people to collect one from the PCR vans or police stations, if they cannot afford one. “ We have got masks stitched as well, as wearing of facial masks can reduce the spread of coronavirus substantially,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cops-monitor-cctv-footage-to-crack-down-on-people-not-wearing-masks/story-IwYLmINZ5O8u6cwO17hrvL.html

08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Jhajjar sellers slam odd-even formula, dump veggies on road||A group of vegetable sellers on Monday protested against administration’s decision to adopt ‘odd-even formula’ to open shops by dumping their items on the road outside the Jhajjar vegetable market. Surender Singh, president of the vegetable market, said they were suffering huge losses since the government clamped the nationwide lockdown to tackle the spread of Covid-19.“The Jhajjar administration is imposing new rules on us every day and it is very difficult for us to survive by opening shops on alternate days. We are suffering losses and the administration should allow us to open shops every day so that we can earn our livelihood. We are even wearing protective gear and maintaining social distance, but the administration is not paying heeds to our demands,” he added. Jhajjar SDM Sikha said she has heard the grievances of the vegetable sellers and assured them of giving an alternative solution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jhajjar-sellers-slam-odd-even-formula-dump-veggies-on-road/story-sQDjBUHfvfaSERztrkphEK.html
08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Man shot at in Ambala, alleges Rs 20 lakh extortion bid||Ambala: A man was shot at an injured in Ambala on Monday early morning allegedly not paying Rs 20 lakh to an extortionist, even as police investigate a rivalry angle over gambling. The victim Sumit Kumar from Khatik Mandi and his friend, retired Army man Sunil Dutt, were on a two-wheeler when a car drove up alongside and six men attempted to kidnap Kumar, the latter said in his complaint to the police.As Kumar and Dutt resisted, one man “fired from a pistol, hitting Sumit on the side. The shooter shouted out his name and said Kumar owed him Rs 20 lakh, “another man robbed my licensed revolver and fled in the car,” said Dutt.The complainant also alleged that Kumar had told him that he had seen the car outside the house of a criminal who was out of prison on parole and that the man who had mentioned Rs 20 lakh had come to Kumar’s shop asking for the same amount as ransom money.Kumar was referred to Government Medical College and Hospital, Chandigarh from the Ambala Cantt Civil Hospital. An FIR was registered under various sections of the IPC and Arms Act against the three men mentioned in the complaint at the Ambala Cantt police station.“We understand that there is some old rivalry between these men over gambling money and we are investigating the complainant’s claim too,” said superintendent of police Abhishek Jorwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/man-shot-at-in-ambala-alleges-rs-20-lakh-extortion-bid/story-LN6UuN7xo6DDFLhzCFrGnJ.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Working from office is better than from home, say Mumbai officegoers||Barring the travel hurdles, most Mumbaiites, who returned to work on Monday after almost three months of lockdown owing to the Covid-19 pandemic, said working from office was easier than from home.“Not everyone has a personal computer at their place, and as exports come under essential services, it is easier to work from office. We have been asked to come in as and when there is work,” said Ameya Shirsat, who works for a shipping company. He said they have been asked to wear masks and gloves and carry sanitisers. Also, the three employees who reported to work on Monday, were asked to sit at a distance from each other.In most offices, those with private vehicles or staying close to their workplace could reach, while the others were given an option of working from home. Sandesh Gudekar, who works in the loan department of a bank, said there are guidelines for everyone reporting to work, wherein body temperatures of all employees is checked and they are asked to download Aarogya Setu mobile application. “Anyone who has close contact with a patient or any symptom is asked not to report to work. Although travelling takes time and is a concern, I think coming to office is better,” said Gudekar.Mehul Ramaiya, an investment banker, waited at the bus stop on Monday morning for almost an hour, only to return home. His office is at Fort and on a normal day, he would take a train from his home at Ghatkopar. “Only two people from our office reached today, one who stays close by and my boss in his own vehicle. If the government wants to open up the economy, the onus of ensuring transport facility must be on the employer,” said Ramaiya. “Buses were plying at a frequency of six-eight minutes. But they were full by the time they reached my stop,” said Ramaiya.Some organisations also decided to start a rotational working system with employees reporting to work only on specific days of the week.Some were happy as only a limited number of people could step out. “It usually takes me around 25 minutes to reach my workplace in Chembur. But today it took half the time. Also, just three of us reported to work. This is much more convenient, as offices are asked to shut early. So one will be back home on time and by early evening,” said Nirav Mehta, marketing consultant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/working-from-office-is-better-than-from-home-say-mumbai-officegoers/story-2x1p97JlGVFzaMex4LhnyJ.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||Opposition welcomes L-G’s order, slams Kejriwal for diverting attention from his govt’s failures||The opposition parties on Monday welcomed lieutenant-governor (L-G) Anil Baijal’s decision to overrule the state government’s order reserving hospital beds in the national capital exclusively for Delhi residents and stopping the testing of asymptomatic contacts of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients.Both the Bharatiya Janata Party and the Congress said the government’s order was “legally untenable”. They said it was just a diversionary tactic by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to shift focus from his government’s alleged failure to augment healthcare infrastructure. The Aam Aadmi Party hit back, accusing the BJP of playing dirty politics and putting pressure on the L-G to pass such an order.Welcoming the L-G’s decision, BJP MP from New Delhi Meenakshi Lekhi said, “India is a union of states. The Delhi government’s order was legally untenable, as it was in violation of Article 14 and 21 of the Constitution. How can any state deny a person from another state access to medical care?”Addressing a press conference earlier in the day, Lekhi said the decision had been taken by “someone who was born in Haryana, lived most parts of his life in Kaushambi (in Ghaziabad) and became the chief minister of Delhi”, in a veiled reference to Kejriwal’s antecedents. The Congress, which ran the city government for 15 years before AAP wrested power from it in 2014, said the government reserved the beds knowing fully well that the decision had no firm legal footing. Former Delhi MP Ajay Maken said, “The Delhi high court in 2018 had ruled against the government’s decision to reserve a certain number of beds in GTB hospital for Delhi residents only. Kejriwal can’t be oblivious to it. This was just an attempt to divert people’s attention from his government’s failure to augment the medical facility.” East Delhi MP Gautam Gambhir took to Twitter to welcome the L-G’s decision. He tweeted, “Excellent step by LG to overrule Delhi Govt’s idiotic order of not treating patients from other states! India is ONE and we have to fight this pandemic together! #IndiaFightsCorona (sic).”Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said the decision to stop testing of asymptomatic contacts of Covid-19 patients was against the Centre’s guidelines. “Testing is crucial right now to prevent the spread of the disease. But this government is arbitrarily taking decisions and putting people’s lives at risk,” he said. Kejriwal on Monday placed himself in home quarantine after he felt unwell. Lekhi came down heavily on AAP on the issue of discrepancy in data about hospital beds, according to the Delhi Corona app, launched by the Delhi government itself. She said the five Ts (testing, tracing, treatment, teamwork and tracking) that Kejriwal said were essential for fighting Covid-19 are missing today.“Is this the time to mislead people? You are playing with the lives of people. These are human lives; they are not some lab rats or insects on which you can conduct experiments. This is the time to deliver,” the national BJP spokesperson said.The Congress accused both the BJP and AAP of misleading people. “During such a crisis, the state and the Centre should ensure better coordination. But here, both are working in silos and are just misleading people,” Anil Chaudhary, Delhi Congress chief said.Maken said, “Of the 16,500 plus beds in Central government and municipal hospitals only 1,500-odd are reserved for Covid-19. Similarly, the Delhi government is using just 13% of its bed capacity for Covid treatment. Why can’t the two use their own infrastructure optimally?”The Delhi government had recently ordered that 20% of the total bed strength in private hospitals be reserved for Covid-19 patients. The BJP questioned why beds in other government hospitals are not reserved in a similar manner.AAP reactsThe AAP accused the BJP of playing dirty politics by putting pressure on the L-G to pass an “unconstitutional order”.Deputy CM Manish Sisodia tweeted, “The BJP-ruled state governments are busy in PPE kit and ventilator scams. The Delhi government is trying to manage this disaster by making honest efforts and careful planning. But BJP is not liking it and has done dirty politics by putting pressure on the LG. (sic)”AAP MLA and party’s national spokesperson Raghav Chadha tweeted, “BJP sponsored order issued by LG is draconian, unconstitutional & against spirit of democracy. How can LG,by merely writing a few paragraphs on his letter head,overrule the decision of a democratically elected govt’s cabinet. Moreover, this is an affront to the health of Delhiites.

While the hospital has 100 beds, half of the beds have been reserved for police personnel, confirmed Dattatray Shinde, superintendent of police (SP), Palghar. This is the second Covid hospital for police personnel in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) after the 1,000-bed hospital in Kalina, Mumbai was opened in May, said Shinde. “We had made a demand for a dedicated Covid health centre (DCHC) to Palghar district collector Dr Kailas Shinde, and the requirement was sent to Dr Kanchan Vanare, civil surgeon, who agreed to open the 100-bed hospital in Posheri,” said Shinde. He added that a few police personnel have already been admitted in the DCHC as a precautionary measure. The hospital will be equipped with all facilities to combat the virus and if needed, more beds will be added in phases in the next few weeks, Shinde said. The DCHC has three divisions for better treatment of patients, particularly police personnel in Palghar.Shinde added that Covid warriors such as healthcare, government and other staff can also seek treatment at the centre.So far, there have been 40 deaths, including a few policemen, reported in Palghar district and 1,236 patients have tested positive in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dedicated-covid-centre-for-cops-becomes-operational-in-palghar/story-SDbXflQuBgwvayKekGFyMM.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Not on their BEST behaviour, many crowd to board buses||Several instances of violation of social distancing norms were witnessed in Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses, as they began ferrying commuters on Monday as part of the state’s Mission Begin Again. As the state started to lift the lockdown owing to the Covid-19 pandemic in phases, BEST became the first public transport system to start operations. BEST is the second largest public transport system in Mumbai after the suburban train network. BEST authorities announced that only 30 passengers, including five standing, would be allowed and social distancing would be strictly followed. BEST operated 2,132 buses on 81 routes in the city. However, the administration received several complaints of passengers not adhering to social distancing, sitting next to each other and more than five passengers standing in the buses. “We request passengers to maintain social distancing. It could take time and passengers might have to wait, but we are operating extra buses to clear the rush,” said Surendrakumar Bagde, general manager, BEST.Passengers also complained of many BEST buses being cancelled. “People were standing in queue only to find the buses were cancelled. I wanted to go to Sakinaka and had to let 30 buses pass. Two buses were cancelled,” said Aarti Singh, a Vikhroli resident.Transport experts said increasing the number of buses could be a solution. “Operation of buses is a true test for the possible operation of trains. Social distancing will be easily possible if more buses are added and operated from multiple locations. School buses are lying idle with the management, which could be put to use,” said transport expert Ashok Datar. Meanwhile, the Navi Mumbai Municipal Transport (NMMT), too, resumed operations on Monday, with 215 buses making 858 rounds. NMMT was being used only for essential services since March 25, amid the lockdown restrictions. It had then been running 112 buses with 398 services on various routes within and outside city.Municipal commissioner Annasaheb Misal said, “The bus will be filled to a maximum 50% capacity and only 5 or 3 passengers, depending on the size of the bus, will be allowed to stand.”Inputs from G Mohiuddin Jeddy||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/not-on-their-best-behaviour-many-crowd-to-board-buses/story-CbR8SiQ6onFtyVP931zFMO.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Private labs must give Covid test results within 24 hours: BMC Commissioner||Private laboratories in Mumbai will not be allowed to function if they do not give Covid-19 test results within 24 hours, said Mumbai municipal commissioner, IS Chahal, on Tuesday. In an interview to a leading electronic media house, Chahal said, “Some Covid-19 testing labs have committed a serious crime by delaying test reports by 18 days. They deserve to be punished.” Chahal said, “When I joined, I found that April 4 swab results had come on April 22. We could not wait for 18 days to track high risk contacts. I told them unless you give me swab reports in 24 hours, you cannot function in Mumbai. Don’t chew more than you can digest.” Regarding altering testing guidelines in Mumbai, Chahal said, “We have gone beyond ICMR guidelines. We have said that for high-risk contacts of positive cases who are home-quarantined, their swabs can be collected at home, where as ICMR had said no to home collecting of swabs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/private-labs-must-give-covid-test-results-within-24-hours-bmc-commissioner/story-SnrYc7Gf1NuJk3Ok4AG42N.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||No Covid sample collection at several private labs on Monday||Several private laboratories did not collect Covid-19 samples for the second day on Monday. Out of ten private laboratories that HT called on Monday, four didn’t answer, five said they were not providing the service temporarily and one had a token system in place—patients had to come in early in the morning to give their samples on a first-come-first-served basis.The labs that have temporarily stopped collecting samples include City X-Ray and Scan Clinic in Tilak Nagar, and Lifeline Laboratory in Green Park (which is at capacity and cannot test any more samples until it clears its backlog). Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute said they could collect samples only if the Oncquest laboratory was ready to test as they had outsourced Covid-19 testing to them.The government banned eight labs from testing samples after pulling them up on June 5 for not following protocols, and, according to the health minister, taking too long to report results. These include Dr Lal Pathlabs, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Prognosis laboratory, SRL reference laboratory, Fortis Hospital, Star Imaging Path laboratory, Pathkind labs and the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC). The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) now recognises 23 private laboratories for Covid-19 testing.HT had reported on Sunday that most private laboratories in Delhi had either capped the number of people they test in a day or were not collecting samples for some time, making it very difficult to patients to get tested for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the capital.Delhi’s testing protocol is tighter than that of the Indian Council of Medical Research. Tests are restricted to symptomatic individuals. Even direct contacts of infected people can be tested only if they are senior citizens or have co-morbid conditions. Due to private laboratories not functioning, most patients will have to go to a hospital flu or fever clinic directly to get tested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-covid-sample-collection-at-several-private-labs-on-monday/story-qvpUuPjTDKwEaq8FFGk0WL.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai unlocks offices, makes a wary slow start||After three months of lockdown amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the city on Monday inched towards its return to normalcy, as private offices began working with 10% staff and Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses began plying, under the last leg of Maharashtra government’s three-phased ‘Mission Begin Again’ to kickstart the country’s financial capital. Sporting masks and carrying sanitisers, Mumbaiites were seen scrambling to board buses, to catch a bus or a taxi to office, with social distancing compromised in several cases, videos of which surfaced on social media.The third phase of the unlockdown began on Monday, with the traffic control room recording a moderate or dense traffic flow in many parts of Mumbai. Major arterial roads namely Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Road in south and central Mumbai, LBS Road in the eastern suburbs, SV Road in the western suburbs, and freeways such as the Western Express Highway and the Eastern Expressway saw considerable traffic. The entry points to Mumbai – Navi Mumbai toll plaza, checkpoints between Thane and Mumbai, and Panvel and Mumbai – reported slow vehicular movement. Private offices picked only those who have four-wheeler vehicles to come to work, as part of their 10% allowed staff, which added to the traffic on the road. BEST operated 2,132 buses on 81 routes, with only 30 passengers, 25 sitting and five standing. However, long queues were seen at the bus stops, and crowds, including those of essential workers, rushing to board, with blatant disregard to social distancing. HT too recorded a video of such an incident outside BMC headquarters. “The response from passengers has been welcoming. There were instances where passengers had to wait for some time, but the number of buses was increased. Extra buses were also operated,” said Surendrakumar Bagde, general manager, BEST. BEST also clarified that, “BEST bus conductors have been asked to ensure social distancing is maintained and only five passengers are standing.”While shops in the city were allowed to open from Friday, many couldn’t, owing to lack of staff, who could not report to work in the absence of transport. Such shops managed to finally open on Monday.Viren Shah, president of Federation of Retail Traders’ Welfare Association, said, “Many shops were either closed since Friday, or were not working at full capacity. Business started on Monday.”A few passengers also complained about buses being cancelled and delayed. “I waited for 40 minutes to get a bus from Ghatkopar towards Mulund. The buses were delayed and the ones that were arriving were full. I work as a security guard and today is my first day at work after lockdown,” said Akhlakh Khan, a Ghatkopar resident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-unlocks-offices-makes-a-wary-slow-start/story-GFvZqupHVGukkbn1uWMYlN.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||SC refuses to interfere with Haryana law making Hindi as official language of lower courts||The Supreme Court on Monday refused to interfere with the decision of Haryana government to enforce Hindi as official language in all subordinate courts and tribunals across the state. Some lawyers have moved the top court challenging the Haryana Official language (Amendment) Act of 2020, which makes Hindi as official language in courts and tribunals of the state. A bench of Chief Justice SA Bobde and Justices AS Bopanna and Hrishikesh Roy questioned the petitioners as to what was wrong with the law as around 80% of the litigants do not understand English. “There is nothing wrong in Hindi as the official language of subordinate courts in some states. Even, during the British Rule, the recording of evidence was done in vernacular language,” the bench said, observing that it is fair for the state to bring such law. Petitioner in-person Sameer Jain said he was not against conducting of court’s proceedings in Hindi or any other vernacular language but since he was from Delhi-NCR region, it would be difficult for lawyers to argue in Hindi in Haryana courts. He said it would be difficult for multinational companies to argue their cases in Hindi. To this, the bench said that the law under question does not exclude English language and it can be used with the permission of court. The top court, which was initially inclined to issue notice and seek reply from the state government, was told by additional advocate general Arun Bhardwaj that the state enacted the law under the powers vested in the state under section 272 of CrPC and section 137 (2) of CPC. He said the state was empowered to enact such a law to bring transparency and to enable the litigants understand what transpires in the court proceedings. The top court said that there is nothing wrong in section 3A of the said amendment as no fundamental rights is violated.The Chief Justice said that proceedings are done in Hindi/vernacular language in many states including Madhya Pradesh. Petitioners then sought to withdraw the petition with liberty to approach the Punjab and Haryana High Court. Five lawyers, including Sameer Jain, moved the top court challenging the state law which says that in all civil and criminal courts, in all revenue courts and rent tribunals of the state and any other tribunal or court constituted by the state government, work shall be done in Hindi language. They contended that Haryana Official Language (Amendment) Act of 2020 has unconstitutionally and arbitrarily imposed Hindi as official language to be used in lower courts across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/sc-refuses-to-interfere-with-haryana-law-making-hindi-as-official-language-of-lower-courts/story-Gh5lxuBxD85ljCTGLNPtlM.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Unlock 1: BMC employees with disabilities seek clarity from BMC on being exempted from coming to work||Employees with disabilities working with the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) have sought clarity on whether they would be exempted from coming to work after restrictions were relaxed from Monday onwards. There are 5,000 people physically challenged people, including around 400 visually impaired, working in the BMC.Visually-impaired BMC control room operator from G-North municipal ward Dilip Zanwar, 40, resident of Vangani in the outskirts of the city said, “Based on a circular issued on May 26 making 75% employee strength was made mandatory at BMC offices, it was told to us that paid leaves (for the entire year) would be deducted for the number of days if we did not report to work. Since the local trains are not functioning, there are fluctuating bus timings, and no transport facilities (carpool) being provided for us to reach our respective offices, it will be a huge risk trying it on our own.” Another physically challenged BMC employee said, “I am on the only bread earner in my family. If something happens during travelling, my family will not be able to manage under the present circumstances.” On June 4, the National Federation of the Blind (NFOB), Maharashtra chapter wrote to municipal commissioner chief I S Chahal seeking clarity on the matter. “We are insisting that a separate circular be issued for visually challenged and handicapped employees exempting from their services till local trains begin functioning again, and till such time their earned leaves not be deducted,” said DP Jadhav, general secretary, NFOB. BMC general administrative department clarified that employees with disabilities were exempted from travelling to work until further notice. “Based on the circular issued on April 21 by the state’s general administration department, a clause clearly mentioned special consideration given to employees with disabilities that need not report for duty. That concession continues in subsequent circulars issued by us. We have only followed the state’s dictate and no changes have been made. Any further alterations from the state administration will be replicated by us,” said Milin Sawant, deputy municipal commissioner (general administration) BMC. However, it was not clear what disabled employees were supposed to do if specific departments of the BMC issued separate directives. “If there is shortage of staff for health or solid waste management department, it is their prerogative to check the feasibility of employees with disabilities being called to work,” said another BMC official adding, “As far as leaves are concerned, BMC will implement what the state government finally decides.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/unlock-1-bmc-employees-with-disabilities-seek-clarity-from-bmc-on-being-exempted-from-coming-to-work/story-9aGlgSfCS9dC2leMRAurZK.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai officegoers are back on roads, so are traffic snarls||As offices in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) reopened after almost three months on Monday, under the Maharashtra government’s third phase of ‘Mission Begin Again’ campaign amid the Covid-19 lockdown, all main roads saw traffic during morning and evening peak hours.Suburban train services – Mumbai’s public transport lifeline – are yet to resume operations, which forced office-goers, traders and shopkeepers to use private vehicles to reach their workplaces.With the increased traffic movement on the Western Express Highway (WEH), a major north-south arterial road connecting suburban Dahisar to Bandra, many motorists took to Twitter to appeal for opening of flyovers on the busy stretch. “Kherwadi Bandra flyover needs to be opened, a hell lot of traffic at the junction towards Bandra Kurla Complex (BKC) and south Mumbai,” a commuter tweeted.A commuter travelling on WEH tweeted, tagging the Mumbai Police: “Guys entire Western Express Highway’s northbound is free-flowing, but for the bridge at Vile Parle Domestic Airport shut ... For no reason! Jam created !!! Mumbai Traffic Police please look into our inconvenience!” Another commuter tweeted: “As Mumbaikars hit the roads again, it’s time to wish us luck for a new start to this new world. But, unfortunately, our traffic remains the same.”Traffic snarls were also reported along certain stretches of the Eastern Express Highway (EEH), a north-south artery of Mumbai that connects its eastern suburbs and Thane; Sion-Panvel highway, Lal Bahadur Shastri (LBS) Road and Swami Vivekanand (SV) Road.By evening, the traffic on the Sion-Panvel highway was badly hit after a collision between a dumper truck and BEST bus. The bus was plying from Navi Mumbai to Wadala, when the accident took place around 5.15pm. The front portion of the left side of the bus was stuck to the dumper. A passenger was severely injured in the incident. Toll plazas at Mulund, Vashi, and Dahisar reported major traffic congestion even though the government has been encouraging the use of FASTag, an electronic and automated toll collection mechanism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-officegoers-are-back-on-roads-so-are-traffic-snarls/story-YGpGlQuey6LiRzBMWMSXbP.html

It varies from day- to-day and subject to subject,” he added.“After teachers come to school, they will track the data and also prepare plans for phase-wise reopening of the schools,” Brar said.However, he added that the final decision will be taken by senior officials and depend on government of India’s notification on reopening of schools.As per sources, not more than 25 % of teachers will be called to school and principal of each school will be authorised to prepare a roster.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-education-dept-planning-to-call-teachers-to-school-from-june-15/story-ft9WhvCaVoC34hTK8mLYdK.html
08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab water supply dept orders probe into Balongi gas leak||Mohali : A day after chlorine gas leakage from the waterworks facility at Balongi in Kharar led to the hospitalisation of 30 persons, the principal secretary, department of water supply and sanitation, Punjab, Jaspreet Talwar ordered an inquiry into the incident. In a report submitted by superintendent engineer, RP Gupta, on Monday said an old cylinder with 5 kg chlorine gas kept at the waterworks for several years had leaked as its insides had rusted.This raises questions about the authorities being unaware of the presence of hazardous material at waterworks and other sites which pose a risk to the life of people living nearby. “We got to know that most of unused cylinders are lying at various waterworks since 2010 and have asked the officials concerned to remove them immediately. Since the past several years, the department is not using gaseous chlorine and we use liquid sodium hypochlorite for the purpose of chlorination at all waterworks. The problem was all these gas filled cylinders have been kept at the waterworks since years and no one even cared to remove them. Now, I have ordered an inquiry and a senior officer will conduct it and the report will be submitted within a week,” Talwar said.The leakage caused panic after people living near the waterworks experienced nausea and eye irritation and 30 of them had to be rushed to the Civil Hospital in Phase-6. The department officials then instructed the officials concerned to remove all such cylinders at the waterworks since 2010.Giving details of the incident, Sahil Sharma, executive engineer, water supply department, Mohali said after the gas leakage the waterworks operator rushed to the spot, following which fire brigade was called. The cylinder was buried in open ground. Mohali civil surgeon Dr Manjit Singh had said on Sunday that the people affected by the leak had been stabilised at the hospital.All of them have now been discharged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-water-supply-dept-orders-probe-into-balongi-gas-leak/story-9uUzcldRiK1zVdbud8BMeM.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Only 2% restaurants provide home delivery, claim not viable option: Association||Despite the state government allowing restaurants and hotels to provide takeaway and delivery of food items, only 2% of such establishments in the city have started such services. The rest have remained closed and expressed reluctance to start operations citing a viability issue.The reason – lack of labour, reluctance of patrons to eat outside food, and various restrictions imposed by housing societies on the entry of delivery staff.According to the Indian Hotels and Restaurants Association (AHAR), of the total 15,000 hotels and restaurants in the city, hardly 300 have started their operations in providing parcels and home delivery.According to Shivanand Shetty, president, AHAR, it is not viable to run the delivery business. “There is no labour currently available in the market as these migrants have all returned to their hometowns,” said Shetty. Similar is the view of Kamlesh Barot, director, Vie Hospitality Private Limited which runs hotels like Revival in Chowpatty. He opined that it did not make business sense to start partial operations. “There are so many overheads incurred if the hotels start their operations. Parcels make up just 10% of any hotel business and it makes no sense to open for this only,” said Barot. “Currently, people are reluctant to eat outside food and this has badly hit our business. Many societies have also stopped home delivery of eatables and it is allowed just up to the society gates. This move has dissuaded many customers from ordering as they don’t want to step out of their houses,” he added.Though the state government has allowed shops to open on alternate days, this does not apply to hotels and restaurants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/only-2-restaurants-provide-home-delivery-claim-not-viable-option-association/story-u2NN8njXG7dRUCvf3qstUO.html

Kuldeep Khatri, president of the Shikshak Nyaya Manch Nagar Nigam, said teachers have not been given their salaries for the months of March, April and May. “We distribute ration and food to the destitute but due to non-payment of salaries our own survival has become tough. Today (Monday), dry ration was not distributed at any of the centres while cooked food was distributed at designated centres,” Khatri said. MCD teachers have been engaged in the work of dry ration and food distribution at municipal schools across north Delhi amid Covid-19 pandemic.However, Ramniwas Solanki, general secretary of the MCD Teachers Association—an umbrella body of all teachers’ associations— said that it was a “symbolic strike”which was staged to protest against non-payment of salaries. “We have given the government and the civic body time till July 14 to resolve the issue. Afterwards, we will go on indefinite strike for the fulfilment of our demands,” Solanki said. He also added that food and ration was distributed at some centres.A senior north civic body official said that the file regarding disbursing salaries of employees is being processed. “We are hopeful that salaries will be released within this month,” the official said.Avtar Singh, mayor north corporation, said that teachers’ problem is genuine but strike is not the way to push for their demands. “We are trying hard to give them salaries. We have asked for the funds from the Delhi government for the same,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/north-civic-body-school-teachers-strike-to-protest-non-payment-of-salaries/story-Aenw72IlqwjX4Rvllz2bNI.html

08-06-2020||Mumbai||Municipal school teachers get trained in new teaching tools||Even as most private schools have switched to the online mode of teaching in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, municipal schools in the city are facing a series of challenges as nearly 50% students do not have access to smartphones or the internet.On Monday, nearly 7,000 teachers from various municipal schools across the city were trained to tackle challenges that await them in the days to come. They were trained in new teaching tools online to ensure that students who have no access to computers or the internet get guidance on their phones.“In a 3-day-long training, we are helping teachers foresee the challenges that have arisen from the crisis, considering that the students who come to civic schools are from poor socio-economic backgrounds with low means. They have been trained to use the online mode of instruction along with offline exercises that can be assigned to students who do not have smartphones and the internet. The goal is to ensure not a single child is left behind,” said Mahesh Palkar, education officer at BMC.As per the data available with the civic body, nearly 50% students do not have access to smartphones or the internet which makes it a challenge for teachers to reach them during the current situation. “We have decided to send textbooks and other learning material to such student’s homes by the second week of June. Teachers would then stay in touch with them and their parents through the phone and would make sure that their learning does not stop,” added Palkar. The civic body would begin online classes for the academic year 2020-21 from June 15.Sainath Durge, member of BMC’s education committee said that while the penetration of smartphones and the internet is a real challenge, schools have to start some learning to ensure that confidence is instilled in the minds of students and their parents. “In many households, parents go out to work, and with this, children might find it difficult to cope without schools. Hence, if learning starts, they would be occupied and their parents would also not have to worry,” he added.Nearly three lakh students’ study in about 1,100 schools under the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). After the exodus of migrant workers and their families from the city, nearly 71,000 students enrolled in these schools have migrated, as per the civic body officials. This has also resulted in poor enrolments for the upcoming academic year, which makes things worse for the civic body as it already struggled to get students to BMC schools with enrolments having fallen by 50% in the last decade, as per the data shared by Praja Foundation.Principals said that they are trying their best to reach out to students. “We are calling to check on them and ensuring that the parents get all the instructions from time to time. Many calls, however, are going unattended as students are not in town or have no network in their hometown,” said the principal of a BMC school in Goregaon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/municipal-school-teachers-get-trained-in-new-teaching-tools/story-SmiASItMIXlcwkEdlVFngM.html

08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Hotels in Ludhiana draw a blank on Day 1||The hotels, which opened after over two-and-a-half months of lockdown on Monday in the city, wore a deserted look as the staff kept on waiting for customers.While luxury hotels, including Park Plaza, Hyatt Regency, Radisson Blu, etc kept their doors closed, the mid-segment hoteliers, that decided to open, rued that not a single customer stepped in till Monday evening.Relieved over the relaxation given by the government to open the hotels, hoteliers rued that the fear of infection among the people and the restrictions imposed on the inter-state movement were taking a toll on their business.Owner of Hotel Green on the Railway Station Road Amarjit Singh said, “Restrictions on the inter-state movement are affecting their business as the visitors, who come from Chandigarh and other districts, go back to their homes the same day. The customers, who visit the city for business from Delhi and other states, book rooms in hotels, but very few people are visiting the industrial town due to the pandemic.”With the government allowing the hotels to open, owners were expecting they would be allowed to organise events with a gathering of 50 people in banquet halls, but their hopes were not fulfilled. The hoteliers are also saving on fixed expenses by opening only a few floors,”Owner of Nagpal Regency on the Ferozepur Road Manjeet Singh said, “Even after hotels have been allowed to open, the scenario is similar to that of a lockdown. The administration has not allowed holding of events in the banquet halls even with a gathering of 50 people. However, customers are approaching us for organising events. We have taken up the matter with the administration, but no relief has yet been provided.” President of the Hotel and Restaurants Association Amarvir Singh said, “The situation will not become normal till the time trains run and the inter-state movement is allowed. All the 125 hotels, that opened in Ludhiana on Monday, received nil response till evening. However, we have taken all the precautionary measures.”The hotels have provided hand sanitisers at the entry points of all the hotels. A few of them have decided to allow entry to only a limited number of persons inside the hotel. At a few hotels, the security staff have also been provided with handy machines to sanitise the shoe soles of the visitors. The hotels have also decided to keep a record of telephone numbers of customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hotels-in-ludhiana-draw-a-blank-on-day-1/story-dOofThNPkCpHtFsCiJwOPL.html

He added that these “so-called reforms are in line with the recommendations of the Shanta Kumar Committee report prepared by a former BJP CM to dismantle MSP and FCI.”“Union minister for agriculture and farmer welfare Narendra Singh Tomar, food processing industries minister Harsimrat Badal and SAD president Sukhbir Singh had termed the three new ordinances as beneficial for farmers, especially those in Punjab. They said MSP will continue, but their statement hid more than it revealed,” he said.Jakhar said that the continuation of MSP is no guarantee that the existing system of open-ended procurement will continue. “Instead of replicating Punjab’s successful model of agriculture mandis, the Centre has allowed marketplaces without regulation, where 15 crore farmers will sell their produce,” he added, claiming that implications of these “tragic announcements” will be disastrous in Punjab.He said the state will lose around Rs 5,000 crore revenue and will not be able to carry out rural development works without mandi fee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/centre-s-ordinances-to-be-disastrous-for-farmers-jakhar/story-62U2MkomQFkNl54jwLVjsJ.html

08-06-2020||Mumbai||Despite government order, labs refuse to test high-risk contacts of patients||Despite an order from the health ministry and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) directing asymptomatic, high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients should tested for the infection, municipal and private diagnostic laboratories are refusing to do so. In some cases, laboratories also refused to test people with comorbidity. Meanwhile, BMC has decided to restart home collection of samples from high-risk contacts.In Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)’s revised testing protocol from May 18, it says, “Asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts of a confirmed case to be tested once between day five and day 10 of coming into contact.” This was reiterated by BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal in end-May. On Monday, additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “We will start home collection of samples of only high-risk contacts, so that they don’t infect others by going outside to give their samples.”Over June 6 and 7, HT called up BMC’s helpline (1916) and private laboratories, claiming to be a high-risk contact. All of them refused to conduct the test for Covid-19.The helpline directed HT to private laboratories. “Until we get the circular or direct instruction, we can’t do the test,” said an assistant on the helpline. Following this, HT called seven private labs, all of whom refused to do the test. Some claimed private labs aren’t “allowed” to test asymptomatic and asked HT to approach BMC. One lab asked for a prescription for the test even though this is not required.On June 1, a 49-year-old man from Borivli succumbed to Covid-19 at civic-run Bhagwati Hospital. He is survived by his 46-year-old wife, who is a cancer survivor, and their 22-year-old son. While she has been shifted to a Covid care centre (CCC-1), their son says BMC has refused to test her for Covid-19 even though she was exposed to the virus for six days. Her son says she’s complained of tiredness, but has not shown any symptoms so far. Cancer survivors are more vulnerable to infection due to their weakened immune system. “If she has the virus, they can start the treatment earlier, but the health officers are refusing [to do a swab test],” said Aniketh Salve, the son. In another case, the family of a 72-year-old man from Ghatkopar, who died of Covid-19 on June 3 at Rajawadi hospital, has been to get his 65-year old, diabetic wife tested for the virus. “When BMC refused, we called private laboratories which asked for a prescription. Now doctors are refusing to prescribe a test to an asymptomatic patient as it is against the rule and they can lose their license,” said a relative. On the issue of prescriptions to test for Covid-19, Kakani said, “A circular has been issued on this matter. With the submission of declaration forms, any high-risk contact of an asymptomatic patient can undergo the test. There is no need for a doctor’s prescription.”However, private labs have pointed out that it is not possible for them to verify someone’s claims of being a high-risk contact. “We don’t have the mechanism to cross-check if the person falls into the category of high-risk. And if mistakenly, we test anyone on such misinformation, BMC holds us responsible,” said a senior officer from a private lab.Last month, show-cause notices were issued to private labs Thyrocare and Metropolis for allegedly testing asymptomatic patients who were not high-risk contacts. BMC has since allowed the labs to resume testing for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-government-order-labs-refuse-to-test-high-risk-contacts-of-patients/story-NsDx2HvnrjhYGllGU4hKJO.html

Meanwhile, 11 residents of Bapu Dham Colony have been discharged from the Covid care centre, taking the total number of recoveries to 285. The recovery rate stands at 89% as compared to the national average of 48%. With five deaths so far, the number of active cases stands at 30.In the first case to be reported in Sector 41, a 25-year-old man, who works in Delhi, was found infected after he returned home on June 2. He has been admitted to the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research. His three family contacts, who were found to be asymptomatic, have been quarantined.In the past two weeks, there have been two more cases of infection found in people returning from other states or abroad — a 40-year-old man from Khuda Ali Sher who had travelled to Delhi and a 27-year-old woman of Sector 9 who returned from Canada. A 25-year-old man from Uttarakhand was also tested positive while visiting his mother in Chandigarh, but his case was not added to the local tally.A senior epidemiologist at the PGIMER, who did not wish to be named, said while symptomatic cases are being detected, there is a need to test asymptomatic returnees as well, as they can act as silent carriers of the virus.Meanwhile, in a case reported from Daria village, the 29-year-old wife of an infected Central Industrial Police Force (CISF) constable has also tested positive. The 33-year-old was posted at the Punjab Civil Secretariat. His three workplace contacts have been sampled. One tested negative while two reports are awaited.The wife of a Manimajra businessman who tested positive on Sunday has also contracted the infection. Their son, however, tested negative. Even as the wife’s case has been added to Chandigarh’s tally, the UT administration is insisting on counting the man’s case in Panchkula’s tally as he was diagnosed with Covid-19 at the civil hospital in Sector 6, Panchkula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sector-41-man-among-6-fresh-cases-in-chandigarh-take-total-count-to-320/story-se4CtaMYFQisITMf3BLqIJ.html

08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Stop misleading people over prasad distribution: Capt to Akalis||Stating that the SAD leadership’s was misleading the people on a sensitive religious issue, Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday held that the decision to bar distribution of prasad at religious places was of the Centre’s, of which the SAD was an integral part.“My government had never believed in interfering with the customs and practices of any religion, but was constrained by the guidelines of the Union home ministry,” said Amarinder, flaying SAD leaders for trying to incite minds against the state government through deceptive statements.How could the state government be held responsible for prohibiting prasad distribution at gurdwaras or other places of worship when the Union health ministry had issued the SOPs to be followed at religious places, the CM asked. It was the MHA that had taken the decision, under the National Disaster Act, to allow opening of religious and some other places from June 8, and had subsequently asked various central ministries to issue the necessary guidelines for the same, he pointed out.As a Union minister, SAD leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal and her party must surely have been consulted before the issuance of the SOPs on the reopening of religious places with effect from June 8, quipped Amarinder.Harsimrat should have put her foot down then, and insisted on allowing distribution of prasad, instead of protesting later and wrongly putting the blame on the state government, he added.“Infact, I had already directed the state’s additional chief secretary (home) to issue instructions for distribution of langar at the gurdwaras in conformity with the Centre’s guidelines. I would be writing to the Prime Minister to allow distribution of Prasad at religious places,” the CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/stop-misleading-people-over-prasad-distribution-capt-to-akalis/story-w9Ef4H0RP5RsZHrFrmYEmO.html

Interacting with mediapersons in Sangrur, Mann said the Badals’ have been directly or indirectly appointing the Akal Takht jathedars and the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) heads for years but the issue of Khalistan is usually raised when the Akali Dal is out of power in Punjab.“It seems that SAD is exerting pressure on the BJP through such statements. When the Badals ruled Punjab for 10 years, no Akal Takht jathedar ever raised the issue of Khalistan. We need to discuss the issues of our farmers, the youth and water. The state has already faced dark days due to political disturbance,” Mann said. “The BJP should also tell the people whether it will continue its alliance with the SAD over this issue or not,” the Sangrur MP added.“AAP is a secular party and we oppose demands like Khalistan. How will the Centre, which has already damaged the country’s federal structure, offer Khalistan?”PUNJAB GOVT HIDING INFO ON COVID PATIENTSSlamming the ‘Mission Fateh’ against the coronavirus, Mann alleged that the state government is hiding information on Covid-19 cases in a bid to project Punjab as virus-free.“There is no proper Covid testing in Punjab. The states like Delhi and Maharashtra are recording more coronavirus patients since they are testing more. The opposition parties and the media are not being provided proper information on positive patients. The AAP will form local teams to check patients in villages and cities,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/clear-stance-on-jathedar-s-remark-on-khalistan-mann-to-badals-bjp/story-41ypgpvqCWQjRzZWqgNUzM.html

The CM said capital expenditure in essential sectors such as health, education and infrastructure will be retained at ₹5,000 crore, notwithstanding the economic crisis facing the state, which was expecting a shortfall of nearly 30% in the total revenue receipts in the financial year 2020-21 due to the lockdown.Reviewing the economic situation in the state, the CM said the focus of his government was on ensuring that salaries and pensions continue to be paid on time, along with power subsidy to the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL). “No compromise will be made when it comes to funding for all frontline departments, such as health, police and the local bodies,” he added. To help the state tide over the economic slowdown, he underlined the need for fast-paced industries’ revival at Rajpura, Bathinda, Ludhiana, and Fatehgarh Sahib, etc. “The focus should be on attracting more investments, particularly from industries and businesses seeking to shift out of China in the wake of the pandemic,” he added.“Power subsidy to the farmers would continue. There is no question of the state government accepting the condition to replace it with direct cash transfer for availing the additional borrowing limit allowed by the Centre. This so-called power reform is in violation of the country’s federal structure,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-lockdown-capt-directs-state-govt-depts-to-rationalise-expenses/story-MR3nUfyLpGtRqKv6ldu8FN.html

Similar protests have been witnessed outside multiple city schools in the last month.In the last 15 days, over 11 such protests have been held by parents.The parents said their economic condition has taken a huge hit amid the lockdown and they can’t afford to pay the fees due to loss of jobs. They added that schools were charging for facilities like air-conditioners and electricity which are not being used as classes are suspended.Nitin Goyal, president of the Chandigarh Parents’ Association said, “There was an argument at Shishu Niketan, Sector 22, where about 15 parents wanted to submit a representation to the school principal. Since no official was available, they pasted it on the school gate.”“As many as 250 parents from St Joseph’s-44 have also signed a complaint which was submitted to the fee regulatory committee,” he added.“Over 100 complaints have been submitted by parents individually, however, some parents feared victimisation of their children by the schools. So we are now going to file joint complaints by parents. Today was the first against St. Joseph’s School. More complaints are going to be submitted in the coming days,” Goyal said.Principals of both schools did not comment on the issue despite calls and text messages||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parents-protest-against-fee-collection-outside-two-schools-in-chandigarh/story-DL59F4mLetmNiEc79CxfWI.html
08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Capt govt to blame for problems faced by private schools, students: AAP||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Monday held the Amarinder Singh government squarely responsible for the problems faced by the students, managements, members of the staff of private schools in the state which were fighting financial constraints triggered by the lockdown.In a joint statement, AAP’s state core committee chairman Budhram, chief spokesperson Baljinder Kaur, deputy leader of legislature party Sarabjit Kaur Manuke and Baldev Singh (all MLAs) said people wanted to know from the chief minister what the state government had done to mitigate the sufferings of millions of private school students, their parents, managements, teachers and other members of the staff in this distressing period.The AAP leaders asked the chief minister to make public where Rs 650 crore ‘reserve fund’ collected from private schools toward security, fees, etc. had been squandered away, since the state government had failed to provide financial assistance to private schools during the lockdown period. “What to speak of extending any financial or other aid to the parents of lakhs of students studying in private schools in the state during these two-and-half months of the extended lockdown, the government did not spare even five minutes to share the trauma they were subjected to undergo,” he said.The AAP leaders also questioned school education minister Vijay Inder Singla if he had convened even a single departmental meeting to work out modalities on state-level policy to address the problems faced by the parents of private school students in paying the fees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capt-govt-to-blame-for-problems-faced-by-private-schools-students-aap/story-SbJSqSjFupdl7eABvKfv1M.html
08-06-2020||Chandigarh||State eyes prime property in Bathinda to generate funds||The cash-strapped state authorities are exploring options to dispose of public properties, including residential accommodation meant for senior officials in Bathinda district, to generate funds.As part of this plan, district administration officials will hold a meeting on Tuesday to assess the feasibility to shift residences of government officers to the Thermal Colony of the now-defunct Guru Nanak Dev Thermal Power Plant (GNDTP), Bathinda. The GNDPT has been defunct since January 1, 2018. Government buildings around the district administrative complex are spread over 40-acre of prime land. Sources said authorities are exploring options on converting this area, comprising over 50 buildings, including the Circuit House, residences of DC, SSP and women police station into a commercial city centre. The idea was first mooted in January this year. “These residences are quite old and prone to acute water-logging. It may be a viable option to dispose of the zone for commercial activities after strengthening infrastructure. The Police Lines complex, located on a very prime location, may also be shifted. A commercial city centre could be developed,” says the source.Spread over 400-acre, the Thermal Colony has emerged as a preferred option, as it has 155 independent houses and over 1,000 flats, but many are in a dilapidated condition. A sizeable part of these independent houses is allocated to the employees of Guru Hargobind Thermal Plant at Lehra Mohabbat, with another section allotted to district officials.Deputy commissioner B Srinivasan said the administration was working to make a proposal in this regard, but there was no finality on the project yet. The move, however, has raised a question mark on the state government’s plan to revive the GNDTP. The closure of the 1,700-acre plant that was started in 1974 continues to evoke strong resentment from workers. Last year, the Punjab State Power Corporation Limited (PSPCL) had approved a plan to start two biomass (predominantly based on paddy straw) units with a capacity to generate 60 MW each.

He said earlier the Delhi chief minister had “forced lakhs of migrants to flee Delhi after denying them ration”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/sad-condemns-kejriwal-for-limiting-treatment-to-delhites-in-capital/story-osiXvGMY7siraO9ErU2uhL.html
08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana keeps power tariff unchanged for FY 20-21||Electricity tariff in Haryana will continue to remain unchanged for the 2020-21 financial year.As per Haryana Electricity Regulatory Commission’s (HERC) order on distribution and retail supply, the tariff for domestic users consuming up to 100 units per month has also been decreased from ₹2.70 per unit to ₹2 per unit if the monthly usage is up to 50 units and from ₹4.50 per unit to ₹2.50 if 100 units are used up in the same period.However, since energy charges in case of domestic consumers are telescopic in nature up to the consumption of 800 units per month, no slab benefit shall be admissible. If the usage exceeds 800 units in a month, ₹7.10 unit tariff will be applicable for total consumption.The two power distribution companies (discoms) – UHBVN and DHBVN – submitted that the power sales to industrial and commercial consumers is likely to be affected severely due to the lockdown and possible delay in the resumption of full-scale economic activity. These categories have a lower distribution loss as compared to the other categories.As a result of the alteration in the consumption mix, the discoms are expected to incur a higher level of distribution loss as compared to the previous year instead of the loss reduction proposed in the original filing. Due to Covid-19 lockdown, the vigilance and loss reduction activities will also be affected.The revised losses have been projected on the basis of estimated consumption of various major consumer categories.The power regulator in its order said that it has examined the true up for the 2018-19 financial year and the fuel surcharge adjustment (FSA) filings for the 2019-20 of the discoms. FSA is an amount the power distribution companies levy on consumers based on varying price of fuel or coal.“The FSA calculations by the discoms are at times not in accordance with the multi-year tariff regulations. The method and amount of FSA being recovered is not comprehended by the electricity consumers. This may lead to under or over recovery of FSA. Accordingly, the regulator directs the licensees to calculate FSA strictly in accordance with the multi-year tariff regulations,” the HERC said.The regulatory commission observed that the aggregate technical and commercial loss (AT&C) target of 18.91% and 15.03% for 2020-21 proposed by UHBVN and DHBVN respectively was on the lower side. “Under the UDAY scheme, Haryana discoms were required to reduce AT&C losses to 15% up to 2018-19 to utilise the central grant, but only DHBVN could achieve the target.The HERC directed the distribution companies to reduce AT&C losses of all urban feeders below 25% and rural feeders below 50% in 2020-21. The discoms have been asked to submit detailed action plan to achieve the target within two months of issuance of orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-keeps-power-tariff-unchanged-for-fy-20-21/story-w968naO5lsOzg19ws6MSCL.html

08-06-2020||Chandigarh||After remaining closed for 77 days, doors of religious places open amid precautions in Ludhiana||After remaining closed due to lockdown for 77 days, doors of various religious places were opened to devotees on Monday with social distancing.In place of ‘parsad’ and charanamrit, priests at temples were armed with sanitisers and infrared thermometers and were seen blessing devotees from a distance.At majority of the places, main sanctum sanctorum was locked to prevent the people from touching idols or sacred books. Circles were drawn at Jama Masjid in Field Gunj to ensure social distancing among people. Shahi Imam Maulana Habib Ur Rehman Sani Ludhianvi, after offering the afternoon namaz, said, “We have to maintain distancing today, so that we can embrace each other tomorrow.”However, ‘karah parsad’ continued to be served in gurdwaras across the city.The government guidelines do not allow serving ‘kadah parsad’ and langar at religious places, but gurdwara authorities, including president of Dukh Niwaran Gurdwara near Jagraon Bridge in Field Gunj Pritpal Singh Pali, stated that serving ‘kadah parsad’ is part of rehat maryada (code of conduct) of the Sikh faith. Pali said all necessary safety measures were,however, being taken.“We are following government guidelines while maintaining the rehat maryada of the Sikh faith. There is minimal human contact involved in preparing ‘karah parsad’. Besides, those involved in the distribution of ‘parsad’ are also wearing mask and gloves and using a ladle to serve ‘pardas’,” said Pali.At Sant Bhuri Wala Mandir near Bharat Nagar Chowk, the sanctum sanctorum of the temple was locked.“We have not opened the sanctum sanctorum to prevent people from touching the idol of the saint. Besides, we have deployed security guards to check temperature of the devotees visiting the temple,” said a sewadar at the temple.ENTRY WITH TOKENS AT DURGA MATA MANDIRThe management of Shri Durga Mata Mandir near Jagraon Bridge has introduced a novel way to maintain social distancing by initiating a token system so that a limited number of people could enter the temple at a given time.Sanjay Mahindru, general secretary of Shri Durga Mata Mandir Trust, said they were allowing only 20 devotees inside the temple premises.At least, 250 devotees visited the temple on Monday, while normally, the number of visitors goes up to 5,000, and 15,000 on Tuesdays.Most of the devotees bowed their heads on main gates of temples instead of going inside. Pouring of water or milk on ‘Shivlings’ was prohibited.Shri Nav Durga Mandir, Sarabha Nagar, received a footfall of only seven devotees from 6 am to 8 am. The devotees were not allowed to bring ‘parsad’, flowers, milk from outside and asked to enter the premises empty- handed.Inspector Jarnail Singh, SHO at Division number 8 police station, said the police had already passed on the instructions to managements of religious places. The police kept a tab outside these places to maintain social distancing among the devotees.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-remaining-closed-for-77-days-doors-of-religious-places-open-amid-precautions-in-ludhiana/story-tC8g6gnwdhekWFQn3B3ZiJ.html

I used to get calls from many people who were in quarantine which forced me to change my phone number,” said a student of the university.“Even my headphones and pen drives containing my pictures were stolen. The person who had stolen it could even misuse my pictures,” she added.The students accused the university administration of mismanagement while handing over the two hostels –H1 and H2 –of the varsity to district administration of Pulwama for administrative quarantine purposes. The two hostels have around 100 rooms.A student of the Jammu division studying at IUST said that the university did not inform them before handing over the hostel rooms for quarantine purposes.“When we came to know that the hostels were being used as quarantine centres, we called the authorities who assured us that our belongings would remain safe,” she said.The students were given two days to collect their belongings from the hostels.IUST controller examinations and in-charge of hostels, Mohammad Amin agreed that people in quarantine had stolen the belongings of the students and also leaked their phone numbers. “We took up the matter with the district administration and the police,” he said.Awantipora tehsildar, Zubair Ahmad said that the police have registered an FIR after a written complaint was given by a student who had been getting phone calls from strangers.“Regarding the missing belongings of students, we have reported the issue to the police after lockers of some rooms were broken,” said Ahmad.Pulwama deputy commissioner Raghav Langer did not respond to repeated calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/people-in-quarantine-centre-at-kashmir-islamic-university-steal-id-cards-clothes-other-things/story-UfIv5nPJOE0ffVHegxldKP.html

With 238 confirmed infections so far, the colony with 60,000 population accounts for 75% Covid-19 cases of Chandigarh.First, its Pocket No. 15 was notified as a containment zone on April 25. Maximum number of cases have been reported from here. Pocket No. 8 was also designated a containment zone on April 29, and a number of houses were quarantined. No case has been reported from this pocket so far. Now, besides a containment zone, the colony with 20 pockets is left with just seven buffer zones (No. 4, 5, 7, 13, 14, 16 and 20) with around 12,000 population, where perimeter control will remain in force. While buffer zone restrictions were removed from Pockets No. 1, 6, 10, 11 and 12, which are not having any active Covid-19 cases, on Monday, restrictions were relaxed in Pockets No. 2, 3, 9, 17, 18 and 19 last week.The administration’s decision came at a time when residents of the colony were up in arms over even “clean” areas (pockets from where no case has been reported) being under strict restrictions. They even threatened to go on an indefinite hunger strike.On Monday, the area affected committee comprising senior officials decided that there was no need to continue the restrictions. On the basis of its report submitted to the administration, the decision to remove perimeter restrictions was taken in the daily review meeting.Even as earlier restrictions imposed on entry and exit stand relaxed now, UT administrator VPS Badnore appealed to the residents to take proper care like social distancing, hand hygiene and wearing of mask in public places to avoid risk of infection.The administrator also appealed to others not to stigmatise the colony residents and give them full opportunities for integrating into the society. He directed the labour department to take up the matter with private employers, so that their pending wages could be paid and job opportunities increased.“The matter regarding exemption of water and electricity charges of areas, which were kept under containment zone is being examined. All symptomatic patients in Bapu Dham Colony have been medically treated. There should be no hesitation among the employees in accepting them back in their jobs,” said UT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/parts-of-bapu-dham-colony-dhanas-lose-containment-tag-in-chandigarh/story-WnmMfPos8rPnWuQ4DpSX7N.html

Commissioner secretary (health) Atul Duloo said that the administration has increased the bed strength of its Covid-19 hospitals in the UT. On Sunday, the Union territory reported the highest number of Covid-19 positive cases at 620, with most cases from Kashmir’s Baramulla and Kulgam district. A day before, 143 positive cases were reported and on Thursday and Friday, 182 and 285 cases respectively were reported from different parts of J&K.However, a surge in the cases has been from the Kashmir province with many healthcare workers and pregnant women testing positive. The surge in Covid-19 cases has led to a shortage of beds in some hospitals and so the administration is creating extra spaces to accommodate more patients. “The administration needs to change its strategy as the patient load is increasing. A special emphasis should be laid on home quarantine and asymptomatic patients should be quarantined in their homes which will reduce the burden on the system,’’ said a senior doctor posted at Government Medical College Srinagar.SKIMS medical superintendent, Dr Farooq Jan said that 60 beds have been dedicated for Covid-19 patients. “If the need arises, then more beds will be allotted to such patients.”Dr Salim Khan posted at Government Medical College who is also the nodal officer for Covid said that for asymptomatic cases, the government has Covid care centres which are either primary health centres or community health centres. ‘’Now such persons shall be shifted to these centres while main hospitals shall be kept for moderate to severe patients,” he said. Meanwhile, the administration has now eased restrictions in Kashmir districts which had been declared as red zone.

The tally of infected persons in Panipat increased to 83 from 62, in Kurukshetra to 52 from 31 and in Kaithal to 44 from 18 since June 1.Even the recovery rate has declined to 33.14% from 47.73% a week ago, creating more problems for doctors and paramedic staff.“No doubt the prevailing situation is worrisome, especially for doctors and other medical staff. But giving relaxations in the lockdown at this time has increased our apprehension,” said a senior staff nurse from Kurukshetra.Another nurse from Karnal’s Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College said, “There is a strong possibility that the cases may increase further. Let’s see how many months it will take to defeat this invisible enemy.”The ground-level employees also bearing the brunt of the contagion surge as their work has increased. “We don’t know why the lockdown was eased when the cases have crossed 2.5 lakh. We have been working day and night for the past one week,” said Asha worker Sudesh Rani from Karnal.Doctors are of the view that the cases may rise further in the next one month. “There is a possibility that cases will reach a peak in the coming days. But we are ready to deal with any situation that could arise,” said Dr Shailender Mamgain, medical superintendent of LNJP Government Hospital, Kurukshetra.Dealing with higher number of cases, the district administrations have appealed the citizens not to hide their travel history and come to get them examined.Reacting over the spike in the past week, Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said, “We are asking people to not hide their travel history and come forward for Covid-19 testing. It is the best way to contain the spread.”“We are well-prepared for any situation and testing around 250 people daily with focus on street vendors and sanitation workers,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/relaxation-in-curbs-amid-mounting-covid-19-cases-worries-frontliners-in-haryana/story-Kasn0B7P4Ri0Xr8ry18P3K.html

08-06-2020||Delhi||Shrines cautiously open doors for devotees, Nizamuddin dargah to stay shut||Following the relaxation in lockdown norms, the faithful are looking forward to revive their spiritual connect, with a visit to their favourite shrine. And the authorities managing temples, gurdwaras, churches and mosques are leaving no stone unturned to ensure the health and safety of devotees.However, with Covid-19 too omnipresent, a visit to the Capital’s places of worship is going to be a very different experience from what it was before the lockdown.At South Delhi’s Kalkaji Temple, sanitisation tunnels have been installed to ensure that pilgrims thronging the temple stay safe. Pt Mahant Surendranath Avdhoot says, “We resolve to follow government guidelines completely. We have pasted stickers on the floor to ensure social distancing, and the temple premises will be sanitised from time to time”.He also appeals to people with co-morbidities to not to visit temples at this time. “We also want to request devotes to avoid bringing elderly citizens, children and pregnant ladies to the temple for the time being, as their safety is paramount. We also urge all to use face masks and not to offer or exchange any prasad,” Pt Avdhoot adds.The Delhi Sikh Gurudwara Management Committee (DSGMC) is also gearing up with measures to ensure smooth and safe ‘darshan’ for all devotees, as the management believes that a visit to these sacred places will infuse the citizens with much positivity at this time of pandemic. “We are putting measures in place to make sure that the maximum number of people can take blessings in the shortest possible time. We don’t want people to wait in queues, as that often leads to flouting of social distancing norms. Hence, we are making more entry and exit points, besides installing sanitiser dispensers at multiple spots. For now, we won’t allow people to sit inside the gurdwara premises, they can come, have darshan and leave,” shares Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president, DSGMC.He, however, is not convinced with the rule disallowing distribution of ‘prasad’, which he feels is an integral part of belief. “How will we convince people that they can purchase sweets from shops, liquor from vendors, but can’t take ‘prasad’ from a place of their faith? We will raise the issue with the concerned authorities to find a solution,” he says, while adding that people derive their strength from such religious places and hence it is their duty to ensure that no one is deprived from seeking divine blessings in these troubled times.Sirsa also requests all non-Sikh devotees to carry their own head covers as they would be no longer provided at gurdwaras, owing to hygiene issues.Mosques in the capital are also taking necessary steps to follow social distancing during community prayers. Maulana Mohd Furqan Qasmi of Old Delhi’s Shahi Sunehri Masjid says, “Mosques have always been high on cleanliness and hygiene and these aspects will be in greater focus. Even as we allow people to offer namaz within our premises, no one will be permitted to stay any longer and proper social distancing will be ensured. Following the health advisory and guidelines of the government remains our top priority.”Meanwhile, the dargah of the revered 13th century Sufi saint, Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, is yet to take a call on reopening for devotees. “Chances are that we won’t be reopening it anytime soon. The Nizamuddin dargah premises houses monuments which are hundreds of years old, so apart from maintaining social distancing and the safety of devotees, we have the added challenge of ensuring the safety of these historical sites. We consulted experts and they told us that excessive use of hard chemicals can be counterproductive for such heritage structures,” says Sufi Ajmal Nizami, custodian of the dargah.He also reveals that the urs (death anniversary) of Amir Khusro, an acclaimed poet and disciple of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya, usually attended by thousands of devotees from across the world, will be a closed affair this year. “It will be observed from June 9-13, but the general public will not be allowed. A few select patrons will go through the rituals,” Nizami adds.Devotees on the other hand are divided over the prospect of finally getting to pray at shrines.“I usually visit Kalkaji temple in Delhi at least once a month. The sacred energy that one gets is amazing. It has been a long gap and I am really looking forward to praying there as soon as it reopens,” says Noida resident Pragya Sharma, agreeing it is going to be a very different experience now. “We have avoided venturing out for over two months. But this visit is long overdue and I will take all precautions while visiting the temple,” she adds.However, Janakpuri resident Ashok Singh, is sceptical about any such visit under the circumstances. “Paying obeisance at my neighbourhood temple has been part of my daily schedule for years. But since the lockdown, it changed as the temple was closed for outsiders. Now that it is going to reopen, I will desist from visiting it for the time being as it is better to avoid all unnecessary outings. God is omnipresent and I am happy praying at home.”Guidelines for those planning a spiritual outing in the Capital:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/shrines-cautiously-open-doors-for-devotees-nizamuddin-dargah-to-stay-shut/story-7bVkA4OReHOuUsLLezvxyJ.html
08-06-2020||Lucknow||India Post helped 30 lakh people with doorstep cash withdrawal||During the corona-induced lockdown I in April, Santosh Bansal, a marginal farmer of Sitapur wanted to withdraw Rs 5000 urgently for medical treatment of his wife. It was impossible to go to his bank located 15 kilometres away, so he called the postman in his village for help.In a few hours the village postman arrived at Bansal’s door on his cycle. He had a mobile phone in which he punched Bansal’s bank and Aadhar card details and handed him Rs 5,000.This service, called Aadhar-enabled Payment System(AePS) to dispense cash to those who cannot reach the nearest ATM or bank branch, is provided by India Post Payment Bank run by the Indian Postal Services. Anyone with an Aadhar-linked bank account in any bank across India can withdraw a maximum of Rs 10,000 in a day using AePS.The service is a blessing for people living in rural areas where a postman or post office is easier to access than the traditional banking facilities.Chief Postmaster General of Uttar Pradesh Kaushalendra Sinha said that his department made it a point to reach out to as many people as possible to provide this service during the lockdown.“Having money in hand makes things easier, specially corona times where people are told to remain at home,” said Krishna Kumar Yadav, director, Postal Services, Lucknow Headquarters region.With the help of 20,000 representatives, the postal service provided cash to people across the state during lockdown. The postman handed cash to a fisherman in his boat in the middle of Saryu river in Ayodhya, to a general store owner deep inside the forest in Bahraich and to farmers working in their field in east UP.“During the lockdown period we disbursed over Rs 496 crore to around 30 lakh people across Uttar Pradesh. Majority of these beneficiaries is farmers, daily wage earners and labourers,” said Sinha.Through the service, the department also disbursed cash benefits provided by the government under various schemes. “We disbursed old age pension, handicap pension and various schemes under DBT(Direct Benefit Transfer), directly to the beneficiary,” the officer said. “This not only made things easier for them but also protected them against going out and taking the risk of getting infected,” he added.Considering the ease of operation, several camps were held in over 20 districts across the state with help from the local administration. The camps were held in remote places. Villagers were able to withdraw money from their account via AEPS at these camps.The department has also trained the postmen to follow all precautions suggested by the government to prevent Covid-19 infection.Besides delivering cash to people, the postal department also ferried over 23 tonnes of medicines across UP. The department is also delivering essential items including, PPE kits, ventilators and Covid-19 testing kits to hospitals in UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/india-post-helped-30-lakh-people-with-doorstep-cash-withdrawal/story-3dbDY4f6ce2KEmG2q5mIfM.html

08-06-2020||Delhi||2.1 magnitude earthquake occurs near Delhi, 16th in 2 months||A 2.1 magnitude earthquake, too mild to be felt by most people, occurred near Delhi on Monday afternoon, according to the National Center for Seismology. The earthquake had its epicentre 13 km from Haryana’s Gurugram, the center said. This is the sixth earthquake to have its epicentre around Gurugram-Rohtak over the last 10 days. And the 16th quake to be reported in Delhi’s neighbourhood since April this year.Most of these, however, were very mild and only recorded by seismographs.The string of earthquakes or tremors have sparked concerns that a bigger quake could strike the national capital region. Seismologists say the increased frequency does not necessarily imply that a major one is coming but stress that monitoring them is key to being prepared. Unlike many other natural disasters, earthquakes cannot be predicted with any degree of certainty.The 2.1 magnitude earthquake on Monday occurred at a depth of 18 km, also one reason why it wasn’t felt by most people. Shallow earthquakes that occurred at a depth of a few kilometres often lead to greater damage than more powerful deep ones.AP Pandey, a seismologist at the NCS, last week told Hindustan Times that there had been numerous small earthquakes in Delhi and Haryana over the last three years.“The Himalayan plate is moving in the north-northeast direction and subducting beneath the Eurasian plate. So, there is a lot of energy along weak zones which are sometimes released through fissures and lineaments,” he said.A fissure is a crack or a fracture; a lineament is a linear feature corresponding to a fault -- such as a valley or a mountain range. There are several faults in and around Delhi: Mathura fault, Moradabad fault, Delhi-Haridwar ridge, Delhi-Sargodha fault, Mahendergarh and Dehradun fault.The NCS says most of the small earthquakes recorded around Delhi since April this year were along lineaments. “It is good that energy or stress is being released through these lineaments. Otherwise, there can be a big release which can cause widespread damage,” Pandey said last week.Delhi falls under the fourth-highest zone in India, making it vulnerable to earthquakes. But there haven’t been too many earthquakes which have its epicentre in the national capital. Delhi mostly experiences tremors when a quake hits regions as far as central Asia or the Himalayan ranges, known to be a high-seismic zone.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/2-1-magnitude-earthquake-occurs-near-delhi-16th-in-2-months/story-DHlkleLpM4IvLLXoE3TesM.html

08-06-2020||Lucknow||Delhi hospitals being reserved only for Delhiites is‘unfortunate’: Mayawati||Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) supremo Mayawati on Monday termed as “unfortunate” Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement that hospitals run by the Delhi government and private entities will only treat Delhiites during the novel coronavirus crisis.The BSP leader also demanded that the Centre intervene in the matter. Kejriwal on Sunday, while making the announcement, had also said that hospitals run by the Centre will have no such restriction, and if people from other states come to the national capital for specific surgeries, they can get medical treatment at private hospitals. The announcement came after a five-member panel constituted by the AAP government on Saturday suggested that the health infrastructure of the city should be used only for treating Delhiites in view of the raging Covid-19 crisis.In a tweet in Hindi, Mayawati said, “Delhi is the capital of the country. People from all over the country come here for work. If anyone falls ill and is being denied treatment because the person does not belong to Delhi and the Delhi government does not provide treatment, then it is very unfortunate.” In another tweet, Mayawati asked people to follow government norms for ‘Unlock-1’.  “In Unlock-1 people should follow government norms while visiting places and markets which have been allowed to open. They should avoid visiting these places unless very necessary. This is the BSP’s advice in people’s interest,” she said. ‘Unlock-1’ was initiated in the country from Monday under which the nationwide Covid-19 lockdown effectuated on March 25 will be relaxed to a great extent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/delhi-hospitals-being-reserved-only-for-delhiites-is-unfortunate-mayawati/story-1KiyIjtUQboyCcQ0mf1hyI.html

Delhi mostly experiences tremors when a quake hits regions as far as central Asia or the Himalayan ranges, known to be a high-seismic zone.Seismologists, however, say that it is not unusual for the epicentre of these relatively small earthquakes to be in Delhi and neighbouring Haryana, seismologists said.They also say that a larger proportion of people have been feeling the earthquake because most people are at home and there is far less noise associated with traffic movement due to the ongoing Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/low-intensity-earthquake-of-magnitude-2-1-hits-delhi-report/story-1UDwCq0FVXTdBXF8VtR2XO.html

If the Centre had stopped these (international) flights before the coronavirus outbreak spread in India, the situation could have been better and the disease would not have spread as much. Given that the number of cases are increasing rapidly, so we need hospitals to treat city residents,” Jain told news agency ANI.

08-06-2020||Chandigarh||‘Unprecedented efforts on to develop Covid-19 vaccine, parallel investments being made, too’||Chandigarh: The race against time for developing a Covid-19 vaccine and expediting its availability despite disrupting the routine immunisation services and increasing economic disparities are only some of the challenges the pandemic has thrown up. Deputy chief executive officer (CEO) of Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (Gavi), a Geneva-based international organisation, Anuradha Gupta, also a former Haryana bureaucrat who served in the Union health ministry, shared this while speaking on the Covid situation in India, the strategy to speed up availability of the vaccine and measures to prevent disruption of essential health services.How do you see the Covid situation in India?Given India’s large population, the situation could have been much worse had the government not acted in time. With relaxation of lockdown measures, the disease trajectory will need careful monitoring as a sharp spike can overwhelm health systems.Do you think we are prepared if there is widespread community transmission after the lockdown exit?Widespread community transmission of Covid-19 in India will be extremely challenging. Safe and effective Covid vaccines are the best bet to interrupt, and eventually stop, community transmission of the contagion.What’s the status of Covid vaccine development?Efforts going into Covid vaccine development are unprecedented. There are more than 100 vaccine candidates with eight technology platforms. A few are entering human trials. For the first time, parallel investments are happening in manufacturing scale-up so as not to lose time once safety, efficacy and appropriateness of a vaccine is established.How is Gavi contributing towards the Covid-19 situation?We have played a key role in establishing a Covid Vaccine Global Access Facility (Covax Facility). On June 4, Gavi launched an advance market commitment (AMC) for Covid-19 vaccines, an innovative financing instrument which provides volume guarantees with an aim to provide equitable access to low and middle income countries. AstraZeneca, which is developing a Covid-19 vaccine in collaboration with the University of Oxford, became the first vaccine manufacturer to sign up to the AMC with a guarantee to provide 300 million doses of vaccine upon licensure.How are you addressing the immunisation equity issue vis-a-vis children from the marginalised sections?We are supporting countries in preventing the disruption of routine immunisation services, restoring them as early as possible and catching up on children who might have missed their vaccinations because of Covid-19.How is Covid -19 affecting lives and livelihoods?To flatten the disease curve, countries resorted to lockdowns. The poor were the worst hit and many lost their livelihoods. Women, many of who work in the informal sector, are disproportionately affected and are at an increased risk of domestic violence. With economic slowdown, governments in lower income countries struggled to maintain public financing and provision of essential services, further exacerbating inequities. Disruption of essential health services such as immunisation could bring a real risk of losing hard-won gains, leading to resurgence of diseases.How has India fared in controlling the pandemic?Investment in primary health care and strengthening public health systems under the National Rural Health Mission has equipped the country with community-based structures and capacities, an invaluable asset in a pandemic. More than 10 lakh ASHAs and six lakh village health, sanitation and nutrition committees combined with over three lakh ANMs, and anganwadi workers, have enabled the country to do house to house outreach and mobilise community on a large scale.Do you see a collateral damage in the spread of the pandemic in India?Already we are seeing disruption of immunisation services which means 2.5 crore children born every year in India would be at risk of not receiving on-time vaccination against diseases such as polio, measles, diphtheria, pneumonia, diarrhoea. India successfully eliminated polio in 2011. We don’t want it to strike back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/unprecedented-efforts-on-to-develop-covid-19-vaccine-parallel-investments-being-made-too/story-CFigFCqzgDiDhq50OAG8mL.html

08-06-2020||Chandigarh||GNDU to plan architecture of Sultanpur Lodhi’s Pind Babe Nanak Da heritage village||The Punjab government has asked Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, to draw architectural plans for Pind Babe Nanak Da heritage village in Sultanpur Lodhi, Kapurthala. Pind Babe Nanak Da will be the replica of Rai-Bhoi-Di-Talwandi, the village where Guru Nanak was born, which is now in Pakistan.Sultanpur Lodhi MLA Navtej Singh Cheema had raised the matter during a video conference with Punjab chief minister (CM) Captain Amarinder Singh. The CM was told that Punjab chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh had held a meeting regarding the project with the stakeholders. Initially, the chief secretary was planning to loop in an international architect. However, the CM asked him to hire local architects: “An international architect will not know as much about Guru Nanak as our people,” the CM had said.“I think that they (GNDU architects) are the best,” the CM said. The state government’s group of ministers, which include Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa, Charanjit Singh Channi and OP Soni, have selected 70 acres of land behind Gurdwara Ber Sahib, Sultanpur Lodhi, as the site for the heritage village. Most of the land falls in Machi Zowa and Taraf Hazi villages. Officials said the land acquisition process was yet to begin.MUDDY EXTERIOR, HIGH-TECH INTERIORA seven-member committee finalised the concept for Pind Babe Nanak Da heritage village. The exterior of the village will be built of mud in a simulacra of a 400-year-old village. The interior, however, will be studded with modern technology, depicting Guru Nanak’s life between 1469 and 1539.Punjabi University head of Sri Guru Granth Sahib studies professor Sarbjinder Singh, who was a member of the committee, said, “The new village will have 13 ‘pattiyan’ (mohallas) like Rai-Bhoi-Di-Talwandi village had 13 pattiyan. Named after figures of Sikh history, they will meet at the sath (centre or commonplace), where Guru Nanak used to hold dialogue.”Former MP Tarlochan Singh, a member of the concept committee, said the four phases of Guru Nanak’s life will be showcased.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/gndu-to-plan-architecture-of-sultanpur-lodhi-s-pind-babe-nanak-da-heritage-village/story-HTQdOB14c2aEUxNj1hma4J.html

08-06-2020||Delhi||86-year old Delhi resident shines a ray of hope in these grim times by defeating Covid 19||“Jo dawaai dene vala hai, theek karne vala hai, voh paramatma hai. Janm aur maran uske haath mein hai, insaan ke haath mein nahi hai (The supreme power is the one who gives birth and takes life. This is something that we mere mortals don’t have any control over),” says Vishnu Bhagwan Chopra. At 86 years of age, Chopra has not only battled Covid-19, but inspired the world by defeating the virus with his sheer willpower.Towards the end of April, Chopra started having complications with his breathing, so his family decided to get him tested for coronavirus. The test results came positive on April 30 and he was admitted to RML hospital for a little over a fortnight. At first, he was in disbelief. “Main hairaan ho gaya kyuki main baahar gaya hi nahi tha. I was admitted in the ICU of RML hospital. It was clean and my treatment began. They gave me nutritious meals on time, and the quantity was more than enough for me,” he says. But despite the treatment, his results continued testing positive. He was shifted to MD City (Maha Durga Charitable Trust) Hospital in Model Town, which had been turned into a Corona-specific hospital. “I was put in an isolated ward and was very well taken care of. I don’t have any complaints with the way the doctors, nurses and my family have taken care of me,” says the octogenarian. Finally, on May 24, after almost a month, his test came negative. He is at home now and recovering well. “I am on my last leg, and I believe in chanting the lord’s name. Prabhu ka naam bahut bada hai; vohi ek dawaai hai (The lord’s name is very powerful; it’s a medicine). I don’t know if I have willpower. It is He who gives willpower. It is my children and my family who give me strength. They help me move my muscles and massage me, give me my medicines on time and keep telling me to eat,” he says. Dr Nikhil Makhija, Radiologist at MD City Hospital, says, “Coronavirus is a new disease for everyone, so whenever there is a positive case, a state of panic is bound to form. The most important facet is the patient’s willpower. It is important to put the patient at ease. When the patient is calm, 50% of the battle is won. In his case, despite his advanced age, he was very cooperative. That helped in his recovery. The efficacy of the medicines increases if the patient has the will. In addition to medical care, we have to give them emotional and mental care,” he says. When Chopra was discharged, the staff gave him a cheerful farewell, applauding as he was being wheeled out. “One thing that often gets sidelined is the staff. They get into this knowing full well that they are exposing themselves to the virus. It is important to keep them motivated and boost their morale. These are small instances and events that we do to keep the spirits up,” shares Dr Makhija.Interact with Etti Bali @TheBalinianFollow @htlifeandstyle for more||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/86-year-old-delhi-resident-shines-a-ray-of-hope-in-these-grim-times-by-defeating-covid-19/story-Srw0WxNbL9EFVCrZg05UtI.html

08-06-2020||Delhi||From Haryana to UP, people enter Delhi as borders open after curbs relaxed under Unlock 1||A day after Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal announced opening of Delhi’s border, vehicles were seen easily crossing into the national capital.From Haryana to Uttar Pradesh, there was relief for commuters who have to go to the national capital for work or other purposes. Till now, government officials and those with passes were only allowed to enter the national capital.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe border was closed after lockdown was imposed to check the spread of the coronavirus disease. The curbs were relaxed for a few days during the lockdown, but the Delhi government again sealed the border once the number of cases started increasing. Haryana and Uttar Pradesh governments had also imposed border curbs to stop the spike in cases.The announcement of opening the border was made by Kejriwal at a press conference on Sunday. Kejriwal, however, clarified that hotels and banquet halls will not open for now because such facilities could be used to treat Covid-19 patients with a rise in infections.Announcing relaxations as part of “Unlock 1”, Kejriwal had said that malls, restaurants and religious places in Delhi would open from Monday after more than two months since the coronavirus lockdown was imposed, but banquets and hotels would remain closed.After Kejriwal’s announcement, authorities at several malls appeared undecided about the reopening date. Restaurants in popular marketplaces such as Connaught Place and Khan Market said they will need some time to put in place all arrangements, such as change in seating plans.A spokesperson of a prominent mall in South Delhi said the shopping centre has drafted its own standard operating procedures (SOPs) in addition to the ones issued by the Union health ministry. “We will need at least two-three days to put all measures in places. A final date will be decided by tomorrow (Monday),” the spokesperson said on the condition of anonymity.Delhi, which imposed a shutdown on March 23 (two days before the national lockdown), has already allowed the opening of offices - both government and private - and marketplaces, except malls.A section of city residents expressed concerns over the government’s move. BS Vohra, president of Federation of East Delhi resident welfare associations, said, “The government should reconsider opening all markets and malls... the number of cases has increased manifold.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/from-gurugram-to-ghaziabad-people-enter-delhi-as-borders-open-after-curbs-relaxed-under-unlock-1/story-d2iE0fqzjXQm4JkecHf8SN.html

The bodies of Sharmistha Dey and her mother, Papiya Dey, were sent for post mortem examination and police said as of now foul play is being suspected.Police broke into the house after locals informed the Bidhannagar North police station on Sunday that nobody in the house at BE Block was responding to their calls. Officers from the police station said the women were found lying in a bed and were declared dead on arrival at a local hospital. Since residents told the police that both women were ailing, their swab samples were collected for Covid-19 test. Papiya Dey was admitted at a local nursing home recently, police came to know.Sharmistha Dey was earlier married to Surajit Kar Purakayastha, the former director general of West Bengal Police. The couple got divorced a few years ago.Dey had joined the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2014 but its leaders said on Sunday that she did not keep any contact in the last four years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/ex-school-principal-mother-found-dead-in-salt-lake-home/story-WUeNZrKDmBczLQLqLZhwFP.html
08-06-2020||Kolkata||Unlock 1: Bengal’s love for food awaits test as restaurants prepare to open today||Known for their love for food and kept away from eateries and restaurants for more than two months of lockdown because of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), Bengalis will have the option of eating out from Monday. But as some of Kolkata’s famous restaurants prepared to adapt to the new normal, unanswered questions loomed large over the business because of social distancing norms and people’s concern for safety.At Park Street, the Mecca for foodies in the state capital of West Bengal, Sunday was the busiest day in two months at restaurants, some of which date back to the British era, though tables were empty. “We are cleaning our kitchen and the premises. All Covid-19 related safety guidelines will be adhered to. We will operate with half the staff since only 50% tables will be used to ensure social distancing,” Romeo Hansel Bergeon, manager at Peter Cat, one of the oldest continental restaurants in Kolkata, said.Click here for Covid-19 coverage“We are not reducing our menu but a lot depends on the supply of raw materials. We may not be able to serve a dish or two. The big problem, however, is that most customers will ask for alcohol. The government has not allowed bars to operate,” added Bergeon.With around a dozen sit-in and takeaway outlets and famous for serving authentic Bengali cuisine for more than two decades, Bhajahari Manna will remain closed for at least a week because the management feels that the safety guidelines are too broad-based.“We are not talking about selling stationary here. We will serve food and people are going to eat it right there. I will never know if a customer walks in with the coronavirus or walks out with it,” said Siddhartha Bose, one of the managing directors of Bhajahari Manna.“We will watch how the industry operates and then take a decision. We may have to cut down our business by 50% given the loss we suffered,” Bose added.Peerless Inn on Jawaharlal Nehru Street will open only its multi-cuisine restaurant on Monday. “We will offer disposable crockery if customers ask for it,” said Asim Chakraborty, the manager. Known for its biryani and other Mughlai dishes, Aminia will use 50% of its seating capacity. “If customers do not want waiters around we will leave the serving bowls on the table,” said one of the managers. “In these two months I ordered food a few times from restaurants but I need time to gather enough courage to walk into one,” said Abhisek Dutta, a businessman. Shopping malls too will be opening on Monday and sanitization operations were on at full scale the day before.“We are opening our property in Howrah on Monday but will take a week or 10 days to put in place some safety mechanisms at our mall on Elgin Road. This is a new learning experience for us,” Rahul Saraf, the managing director of The Forum Group, said.“One of the aims is to keep the merchandise protected. Trial rooms will be closed but if a garment does not fit the buyer can always exchange it. The outlets will offer a credit note if the right size is not available,” Saraf said.State government offices, which now operate with 50% workforce, will have 70% of people from Monday. Private offices, too, can operate from June 8 with managements deciding the size of manpower, said a notification issued by the state government last week.“However, work from home should be encouraged,” it added.The lockdown has been extended till June 15 in containment zones but the West Bengal government allowed tea and jute industries, along with medium, small and micro industries and construction activities to start production from June 1 with 100% manpower.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/unlock-1-bengal-s-love-for-food-awaits-test-as-restaurants-prepare-to-open-today/story-D3DVYY9n4HDS3igo5qlMmI.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||Harsh Vardhan, AAP at odds over Delhi strategy||Delhi’s action against laboratories and hospitals over the past few days, stopping some from conducting tests, amid a spike in the number of cases and a spate of anecdotal reports about the difficulties of getting tested or finding a hospital bed, came in from sharp attack from the Union health minister who said the state is diluting the Centre’s guidelines and hiding numbers.His comments, made in an interview to HT, evoked an equally sharp response from the state’s Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government which termed it a “wrong assessment”.“Testing, contact tracing and isolating and treating should be the strategy but Delhi seems to be going reverse on the strategy. All states, including Maharashtra and Telangana, are religiously following guidelines to manage Covid except for Delhi, which seems to be diluting the issue,” Harsh Vardhan said.“The labs are being threatened. There is no need to hide numbers as the need is to actively look for people who are infected. Whether you place them under home quarantine, in Covid care centres or health centres depends on their condition; but you definitely cannot leave them undiagnosed and untreated as they will then be roaming around freely, then get sick and report to hospital late. Not to mention how many others they would have infected,” he added.His reference is to the Delhi government’s move to act against hospitals for not following testing guidelines, preventing some of them from conducting tests; and also to its new guidelines that say asymptomatic people who may be direct contacts of infected will not be tested unless they are senior citizens or have co-morbidities.“These people need to be far more serious and sincere and meticulous in their approach in dealing with the pandemic. They seem to be utterly confused in their approach — look at the way they are forcing private hospitals to treat both Covid and non-Covid patients. It runs the risk of cross-infection among patients and health care workers. What do they want to do; turn Delhi into Italy?,” Harsh Vardhan asked. Italy was one of the worst affected countries by the coronavirus disease, with a death toll of 33,899 from 234,998 cases.Delhi’s case load has increased by 5,560 in the past week (Monday to Sunday), with the state adding an average of 794 cases a day. And while, at 2018, the state has tested the most per million population among all Indian states, anecdotally, at least, it has become more difficult to get tested.The health minister added that Delhi is clearly mismanaging the situation, and claimed that he pointed this out to Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain and LG Anil Baijal during his review of the Covid situation last week.According to people present in the review meeting that took place through video conference on June 4, a war of words broke out between the union health minister and Delhi health minister on the issue of Covid management in general, and, specifically, allegations by Delhi government against Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital , including claims that its sample testing was full of errors.“All Central government hospitals in Delhi, including RML, are hospitals of repute and people there are working hard around the clock to handle Covid rush and then to allege they were fudging test results is abhorrent. Test results can change within days but it does not mean there was an error in testing. All our hospitals are trying to accommodate as many patients as possible to ensure there’s no inconvenience. We have created such advanced facilities in Delhi but they (the state government) seem to find fault with everything,” said Harsh Vardhan.The AAP refuted all of the allegations.“That’s a wrong assessment. Perhaps they don’t have complete data. We have acted against only 6 labs out of 42. Do they support wrongdoings by labs? Do they want Delhi government to turn a blind eye to wrongdoings? Or is central government trying to protect shoddy work done by RML lab where negative patients were declared positive?” AAP said in a statement issued in response to HT’s queries.“The Delhi government is committed to protecting the lives and health of its people and will actively take all necessary action if anyone plays with the lives of the people. The CM had mentioned in his press conference that some if these private labs and hospitals are powerful and have connections in all political parties. Therefore, we are not surprised at Union Health Minister’s statement,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/harsh-vardhan-aap-at-odds-over-delhi-strategy/story-WKpP5NsgQAQ6z4sBbAdPHI.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi nears 29,000-mark, death toll mounts to 812||The number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the national capital rose to 28,936 with 1,282 fresh infections, while the death toll climbed to 812, according to the health bulletin issued by the Delhi government on Sunday.The bulletin stated that there are 17,125 active cases, while 10,999 people have either been cured or discharged or have migrated to other states.Delhi had recorded its highest single-day spike in fresh cases—1,513—on June 3. The five-member committee formed by the Delhi government to augment healthcare infrastructure and strengthen the city’s overall preparedness of hospitals to battle Covid-19 has projected that Delhi is likely to see at least one lakh Covid-19 cases by the end of June. According to Dr Mahesh Verma, the chairman of the committee, “We have submitted our report to the government recommending they make an additional facility of 15,000 beds.”He added that Delhi would need about 42,000 beds by July 15.The Delhi government on Sunday issued an order appointing round-the-clock officers in all private hospitals with more than 50 beds in the city to ensure that each of them reserves 20% of their beds for Covid-19 patients and none of them admits patients with mild or no symptoms, who can be quarantined at home.“The undersigned (Delhi’s health secretary Padmini Singla) directs that all allopathic hospitals owned by the Delhi government or run under autonomous mode shall appoint one nursing officer in each private hospital round the clock (24x7)… The concerned private hospital management shall provide a separate room for the officer (sic),” read the order, which HT has seen.The order states that the decision was taken on two grounds – first, the rule reserving 20% beds for Covid-19 patients is adhered to, and, second, to ensure that patients with mild or no symptoms are not admitted without a doctor’s advice.The decision comes a day after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal warned private hospitals in the city against doing so and red-flagged alleged malpractices in the garb of artificial bed crisis.Sunday’s order assigns 68 officers in the 10 fully Covid-19 dedicated private hospitals in the city as well as those that have so far notified the reservation of 20% beds under the government order. Earlier, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had warned that private hospitals failing to follow the order would be converted into full-fledged Covid-19 hospitals.The government on Sunday issued another order setting up helpdesks in all government and private hospitals for the hassle-free admission of Delhi residents, in adherence to the chief minister’s announcement earlier in the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-nears-29-000-mark-death-toll-mounts-to-812/story-iOAFgU7OWgEkCPR9rDIFtL.html
08-06-2020||City||Delhiwale: This week of Amir Khusro||Places of worship are allowed to open from today—after being closed due to the lockdown caused by the pandemic. But the “mahamari” is showing no sign of weakening and the Sufi shrine of Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya in central Delhi will keep its doors closed to the public until at least June 30, informs Peerzada Altamash Nizami, a dargah gaddinashin, an ancestral descendent of Hazrat Nizamuddin. The youthful, soft-spoken gentleman is among a select group of men responsible for the daily prayers in the shrine even in these days of lockdown. Consequently, he says, there will be no qawwalis to celebrate the 716th Urs, or the death anniversary, of Hazrat Amir Khusro that starts tomorrow—his grave lies in Hazrat Nizamuddin Dargah. (The death anniversary of a Sufi saint’s death is not mourned but celebrated. Urs means “wedding” in Arabic, and it symbolises the union of the lover with the beloved, who is God.) On such a signification occasion, the fact that Hazrat Nizamuddin shrine will remain silent and empty is something that has never happened before in its centuries-old life—confirms Mr Nizami. He is talking over WhatsApp video this evening from the dargah’s empty courtyard, with a yellow mask hanging down on his crisp white kurta.Even so, one can still commemorate a figure of history who is not only important in the story of Sufism in India, but is also one of the most celebrated Delhiwallas of all time.At 72, the maker of Hindustani classical music lost interest in the world. Poet Amir Khusro, the 14th-century courtier to seven kings, was in mourning after the death of his spiritual mentor, Sufi saint Hazrat Nizamuddin Auliya.Khusro gave away his wealth, retired to Hazrat Nizamuddin’s tomb, died six months later in 1325, and was buried in the shrine’s courtyard.Perhaps it is a legend. How could one person is said to have simultaneously invented the tabla and sitar, produce the first raga and create the Sufi music of qawwali? The most likely is that Hindustani classical music came out of a civilisation, but Khusro’s poetic genius certainly gave that civilisation its Hindustani characteristic.Folksy and immediate, Khusro’s language – a mix of the courtly Persian and the colloquial Brij Bhasha – merged the ruling-class sophistication to the earthy sensibilities of the masses. His love poems for God shaped the possibility of the idea that Hindus and Muslims could not only co-exist but also celebrate each other’s cultures. Today, the soul of the subcontinent’s Sufi shrines lie in Khusro’s qawwalis. His verses steer many to spirituality, love and, occasionally, ecstasy.Over the years, Khusro’s appeal has seamlessly merged with popular culture. The film song, Zihal-e-miskin mukun baranjish (lyricist Gulzar, 1985 film Ghulami), was inspired from Khusro’s poem, which had alternate lines in Persian and Brij.Zihaal-e-miskeen mukon taghaful (Persian)doraaye nainaan banaye batyaan (Brij)[Do not overlook my misery by blandishing your eyes,and weaving tales; My patience has over-brimmed.]*Another famous Khusro song, Chhap tilak, is completely in Brij.This playful duality defined Khusro. Devoted to a Sufi who disliked emperors, he himself made his living by serving in their courts. It was a shrewd balance of sense and sensibility: day job in the court, evening spirituality in the shrine.Born in Patiali, a village in the present day Etah of Uttar Pradesh, Khusro’s Turkish father died when he was eight. His mother was Indian. He grew up in Delhi with his maternal grandfather who took him regularly to literary soirees. As a court poet, Khusro went on to produce works such as Mathnawi Miftah ul Futuh, Ghurrat ul Kamal, Khaza in ul Futuh, Ashiqa, Baqiya Naqiya and Khamsa. The voluminous Ijaz e Khusrawi is vivid with details of everyday life in 14th-century Delhi. Khusro also compiled a Hindi-Persian dictionary and composed several pahelis, the wordplay riddles.The modern-day tradition for devotees at Hazrat Nizamuddin dargah is to first pray at Khusro’s tomb, though he did not officially inherit Nizamuddin’s spiritual mantle in the Chishti order of Sufism, which went to Hazrat Naseeruddin Chiragh Dilli. Indeed, the poet’s special status in Sufism is linked to his creation of an extraordinary idiom, which devotees have used to articulate their passion for the divine. Above all, he was loved by Hazrat Nizamuddin, who occasionally wrote letters calling him Turkullah, God’s Turk. Those were said to have been buried with Khusro. Khusro’s Urs will be observed from June 9 to 13. In these exceptional times, it will be marked only with quiet prayers conducted across the five days by a small group of dargah’s khadims, or hereditary caretakers. The shrine will be closed to the public. During the ceremony, discloses Mr Nizami, “we’ll also pray for the health of all.”*Translation taken from a book on “languaging” by Ramanjaney K Upadhyay||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhiwale-this-week-of-amir-khusro/story-gftZb1UWLjr5iJqpTLje2O.html
08-06-2020||City||‘Covid-19 has certainly been a rejuvenating balm for planet’||Nobody told us there’d be days like these…strange days indeed!” Once the lockdown is lifted I look forward to going to concerts, embracing my friends, and not wearing a mask. Simple things, normal things. We all just want to get back to life as it was. Human beings weren’t meant to live in a socially distanced world, it’s simply not natural. But the way of living that we want so desperately to return to wasn’t so natural either. If you listen to the rivers, trees and birds today, they’re all saying the same thing: “We’re all much happier now, thank you!” The human pandemic has been good for them. The plants and animals can breathe again, and so can we, and soon enough without a mask.“Get the economy up and running!” “Let’s get back to business as usual!” That’s the vapid message of the world’s great nations. This seems like a tragic waste of a remarkable opportunity. In some ways Corona is a gift; it’s certainly been a rejuvenating balm for the planet. As we emerge from all of this, my biggest fear is that we will forget the good habits that developed during the lockdown: less fossil fuel consumption, more cooking at home, less long-distance travel, more family time, etcetera. It doesn’t seem natural to eat a mango in winter, but that is what plenty of people do thanks to agrotechnology and global trade. It doesn’t feel natural to get into a large metal cylinder and zoom into the stratosphere, but that is what so many of us do every day. And now we’re zooming around the world from the comfort of our homes! What are we doing? Where are we going? Are we rushing back to a dysfunctional way of living that ultimately led us to our present condition?Corona is a fated opportunity. Fated in the sense that it was inevitable: we abused Mother Earth so much that she was forced to strike back in her own way. Perhaps our species deserves this, perhaps our planet needs it. If we imagine our humanity and the entire planet as a single being, we begin to see that the earth has long suffered from the disease of our relentless, near-sighted avarice. Indeed, humanity is an invasive, fast-spreading and destructive virus upon the earth. And after taking this abuse for centuries, the earth has been forced to purge herself of deadly toxins. Corona is a fated opportunity. Opportunity in the sense that we can do things differently now. This is an unprecedented global moment: a time for all of humanity to pause, take a breath and take stock. And if we are to be honest, then the writing is on the wall, and it’s been there for a long time. Scientific studies aren’t needed for any conscientious citizen to plainly see that we’re destroying the planet, abusing precious resources and marginalizing millions of fellow human beings in the process. Change is always slow and difficult, but Corona has given us a chance to take a break and reassess our priorities, and, hopefully, to chart a new course for our collective future as a species on this tiny blue marble.I’m excited about living a more wholesome life in tune with nature. I’m so grateful that the lockdown has afforded me time and space to delve into more holistic ways of living. During this time, I learned how to bake yummy home-made baguettes, I started a garden and made a DYI compost for food scraps, and I spent hours observing and identifying local birds. These kind of things seem like supremely important forms of knowledge for anyone to learn. Fortunately, due to the awesome potential of the internet, I have also been able to continue teaching in universities around the world. It’s not ideal of course, but it shows us that we can live fully even while living with less. When the lockdown is lifted I’d like to have a sitar concert by the river. I want to see beautiful people sprawled out on the green grass in the warm sunshine, laughing, enjoying music and embracing each other. I know I’ll be happy, and I think the birds will be too. In the words of John Lennon whose lyrics started this piece: “There are two basic motivating forces: fear and love. When we are afraid, we pull back from life. When we are in love, we open to all that life has to offer with passion, excitement, and acceptance.” In this extraordinary moment for all of humanity, let us choose love. Love for self, love for other, love for the planet.Srinivas Reddy is a scholar, musician, poet and the author of RAYA: Krishnadevaraya of Vijayanagara.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-has-certainly-been-a-rejuvenating-balm-for-planet/story-O2FDoIMKlDs6ghZol6gc5K.html

Apart from ensuring social distancing and provision of hand sanitisers and infrared thermometers, as mandated in standard operating procedures (SOP), the various religious institutions are going the extra mile to make the devotees’ visit safe.IDOLS TO REMAIN OFF LIMITS AT TEMPLESPresident of the Sector 40 temple and chief of the Hindu Parv Mahasabha in the city, BP Arora said, “Idols will be kept off limits using barricades and ropes. People will also not be allowed inside the Shiv Mandir at any temple. They can pray outside only. Besides, we will not distribute prasad or langar for the time being.”Meanwhile, the ISKCON temple in Sector 36 will not be opening on Monday. City head Nand Maharaj said, “It will take us about a week to abide by the rules before we can open. We are short on volunteers to ensure social distancing within the temple.” POLYCARBONATE SHEETS FOR KNEELING AT GURDWARASAt the Sector 19 gurdwara, the management has placed polycarbonate sheets to facilitate people kneeling before the Guru Granth Sahib.“Unlike carpets, the sheet can be regularly cleaned with sanitiser. Also, we will continue to use disposable meal boxes for the langar service as we have been doing for a month,” said Tejinder Pal Singh, president of the Sector 19 gurdwara committee.The Sector 8 gurdwara has decided to do away with langar and prasad for now. “We will also stop water supply to taps so that people don’t touch them. Shoe room will remain closed, but racks will be placed outside the gurdwara to place shoes in,” said Ravinder Singh, president of the gurdwara committee.ONE PERSON PER BENCH AT CHURCHESFather Premanand, president of the Tricity Churches Association, said there will be a limit on the people allowed inside a church at a time. “Also, only one person will be allowed to sit per bench and children below 10 years and seniors over 65 years won’t be allowed entry,” he said, adding that the congregation will receive the Holy Communion while maintaining social distancing.INDIVIDUAL MATS AT MOSQUES Mosques, which stayed closed through the holy month of Ramadan, will also open up on Monday. Here, devotees will have to bring their own prayer mats, as the SOP discourages the use of common mats. Maulana Ajmal Khan, head of Jama Masjid in Sector 20, said, “We will ensure all directions in the SOP are followed. Devotees must wear face masks. Alcohol-based hand sanitisers will be provided at the entrance, but not kept inside.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/religious-places-in-chandigarh-ready-to-welcome-devotees-with-safeguards-in-tow/story-1CeDmh6ur3kaiLrXHGu6iO.html
08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Tender ‘tweak’ muddies the water for Buddha Nullah revival plan||The ambitious Rs 650-crore Buddha Nullah rejuvenation project, cleared by the state cabinet in January this year, has run into controversy, with an IAS officer accusing his superior and additional chief secretary (local bodies) of manipulating tender in violation of central vigilance commission norms to favour a particular firm.Ajoy Sharma, chief executive officer of Punjab municipal infrastructure development company (PMIDC), has put in writing his reservation to a file noting in March. In his objection, Sharma stated that the tender was restrictive and favoured a particular firm, with ACS Sanjay Kumar not recording the pre-bid facts properly. HT has accessed the file noting. The CEO’s observation has forced the chief minister’s office and chief secretary Karan Avtar Singh to intervene in the matter. It is reliably learnt that the CMO will monitor the tendering process of the project as a senior officer of the finance department has also flagged the same issue.As per documents, Sharma, while referring to a note in file, said it does not objectively captures the proceedings of the February 24 meeting wherein it was clearly told to the ACS that due to the certain pre-conditions in the tender, it had become restrictive. Due to restrictive conditions, most reputed companies --- Tata, Larsen and Turbo, Ramky, WABAG, Triveni and others --- will not be able to participate in bids”.As per the pre-condition, fixed by the local bodies department, the bidder has to secure a particular technology for which only one vendor was available in India. This made all the bidders dependent upon a particular vendor of having that technology. It is mandatory to tie up with the technology provider before filing the tender, reads the document. All major bidders raised objections to it and asked for using proven technology available within India and even worldwide to increase competition. However, the ACS remained firm on the technology provider pre-condition, said sources. When asked, Sharma admitted that he had reservations but refused to divulge details by saying, “I won’t give any comment to the media on this issue”.Sanjay Kumar was appointed as ACS, local bodies, on recommendations of local bodies minister Brahm Mohindra. Sources said the chief secretary had called both Ajoy Sharma and Sanjay Kumar and told the latter to address the objections raised in file. When asked, Kumar said: “The objections (raised by Ajoy Sharma and bidders) have been addressed, and fresh terms and conditions for bidding have been sent to the finance department for approval. Once approved, it would be uploaded on the department website to call technical and financial bids.”On tender condition of a tie-up with “technology partner”, Sanjay said: “The request for proposal (RFP) was made before I joined the department, so how can they blame me for that. Earlier, I was not aware that this condition would limit the competition. However, when the matter was taken up with me, I dropped the pre-condition. I have no intention to favour anyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/tender-tweak-muddies-the-water-for-buddha-nullah-revival-plan/story-alNrhz21jnIiBTe45x1h4M.html
08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh restaurants give thumbs down to 8pm deadline, most to remain shut||Allowed to resume business on Monday, most city restaurants have decided to remain shut, citing problems with UT’s SOP and rent demand for the lockdown period, besides anticipation of low footfall.UT’s standard operating procedures (SOPs) mandate that all restaurants close by 8pm and limit seating capacity to 50%, which restaurateurs say is not conducive for profits.“The fact that we have to take the last order by 7.30pm is bad for business. A large share of our earnings comes during the dinner service, especially in summer. Besides, we can’t seat more than 50% of our capacity. This is sure to translate into losses,” said Ankit Gupta, president of the Chandigarh Hospitality Association.With SOPs also banning serving of liquor, several restaurants in city’s major eating hubs — Sectors 7 and 26 — will keep their doors closed.“Liquor service is part of the ambience offered by restaurants. Absence of liquor sale will certainly affect their earnings,” said Gupta.Manager of Great Bear, Sector 26, Debdip Chaterjee said he will be opening shop only after the sale of alcohol was allowed. Ovenfresh in Sector 7 will be closed for two weeks, as it was being renovated, said Rohit Kumar, its proprietor.However, Social in the same sector and Swagath Restaurant and Bar in Sector 26 will reopen, offering food and non-alcoholic beverages, said Manish Goel, one of the directors of both outlets.In Sector 35, a hub of hotels and fast food joints, most eateries will continue only home delivery and takeaway services. Nikhil Mittal, director of Nik Bakers, Sector 35, said they will offer items on their menu through takeaway only. “We are looking at how the administration enforces the SOP before resuming dine-in services,” he said.The two outlets of Indian Coffee House in Sector 17 and 36 will follow suit, said manager Ramesh Dutt. “We will wait for a few days for clarity before we open up completely,” he said.Some fast food chains are also unlikely to offer dine-in services for now. A senior official from one of the leading fast-food brands in the city, requesting anonymity, said, “All states are going to have different SOP for dine-in restaurants. The management will go over all these before taking a decision on starting dine-ins.”However, chief marketing officer of KFC India, Moksh Chopra said they will be returning with a limited menu. “We have modified our restaurant design to ensure social distancing. A limited menu will allow us to work with a smaller team. We aim to provide contactless dining experience to our patrons,” he said. At Elante Mall, due to impasse over rent between the tenants and the mall owners, the restaurant owners have decided to stay shut on Monday. Sunveer Sondhi, proprietor of Pyramid and head of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), Chandigarh, said, “It is incredibly difficult for restaurant owners to pay the rent for April and May when the mall was closed. We are instead asking for a revenue share model based on footfall.” He said a meeting between the tenants and the mall authorities was scheduled on Monday.Some hotels will resume business on Monday, while others will return after ensuring adherence of the SOP.“The hotels reopening on Monday will follow the SOP and rent out only 50% rooms to maintain social distancing,” said president of the Chandigarh Restaurants and Hotels Association, Arvinder Pal Singh, who is also the proprietor of Hotel Metro in Sectors 35 and 43. General manager of JW Marriott, Sector 35, Ramandeep Marwah said they were ready to serve patrons. “Hotel rooms are available for booking and the dining area of restaurants will also be thrown open to public while adhering to the SOP for hotels and restaurants.”General manager of Hotel Lalit at IT Park, Imit Arora confirmed they won’t be reopening yet. “We first need to train our staff to follow the SOP released by the administration, and will return after that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-restaurants-give-thumbs-down-to-8pm-deadline-most-to-remain-shut/story-d4tUrFuhPTtYe4dSFpU2RI.html

08-06-2020||Gurugram||FIR against Medanta in land allotment case||The Gurugram Police has registered a case against Medanta Hospital, its chairman Dr Naresh Trehan and others for allegedly violating conditions of land allotment in 2004, officials said on Sunday.Following the direction of the Gurugram civil court, the police on Saturday registered the FIR over corruption and money-laundering charges against Dr Trehan, some of his associates and two senior officials of the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). The Medanta Hospital denied the allegations as “false, baseless and motivated”.The case pertains to the allotment of land to the hospital in 2004. The Haryana government, through HSVP, allotted 53 acre of land in Sector 38 along the Delhi-Jaipur road (NH-48) for the development of The Medicity.On official statement by Medanta Hospital said: “This complaint has been filed by a person who claims to be an RTI activist. However, it has been reported in the press that he has had an FIR for extortion registered against him. All the allegations in this complaint are completely false, baseless and motivated.”The FIR was registered after the complainant, Raman Sharma, a resident of Malibu Town, approached the district court. On June 5, the directed the police to lodge an FIR within 24 hours of the receipt of the complaint. It observed that without proper investigation, justice could not be ensured in the case.The complainant alleged that the accused, in connivance with government officials, obtained pecuniary advantage as “land meant for institutional purposes was used for pure commercial, speculative and self servient purposes” and several acres of land were allotted at undervalued rates. Sharma also alleged that the accused obtained occupational certificates based on misrepresentation, as there was no area on the premises that was allocated for medical and paramedical education, as advertised.Aman Yadav, assistant commissioner of police (ACP), Sadar, said: “As per the directions of the court, a case has been registered and we have initiated a probe. A total of 16 respondents including individuals and several companies have been named in the FIR.” Two senior officials of HSVP have also been named in the FIR.The case was registered under sections 406 (criminal breach of trust), 463 (forgery), 467 (forgery of valuable security, will etc), 468 (forgery for the purpose of cheating), 471 (using as genuine a forged document) and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code, and sections 11, 13 (1)d and 13 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act.

08-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai teen collects ₹2.1 lakh, distributes 1,200 masks to hearing impaired||While several groups and individuals have come forward in the past three months to do their bit in the fight against Covid-19 outbreak, 16-year-old Arnav Shah, a student of The Cathedral And John Connon School in Fort has been working to ensure the safety of those with hearing impairment. A month ago, Arnav invited funds for his initiative ‘Naqab’, through which masks designed for the hearing impaired are being distributed. Unlike other masks, these special masks have a layer of plastic around mouth, so that those with hearing impairment can lip read.Until Saturday, Arnav had distributed around 1,200 masks among non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and associations who work with those with hearing impairment.“I made an Instagram page and shared it with my friends on WhatsApp, and asked them to inform their family and friends about the initiative and support as as much as they can. Until Saturday, we have collected around ₹2.11 lakh,” Arnav said. Bandra-based Ali Yavar Jung National Institute of Speech and Hearing Disabilities is one of the institutes has received 500 masks through Arnav’s initiative.“Many recipients who will receive the masks belong to the financially weaker sections of the society. While the government is providing us with funds for sanitisation, they will not provide us with masks. So when we resume operations, we can provide these masks to those who visit the institute,” said institute director Suni Mathew, adding that while such masks have been in circulation at Dehradun and in some places abroad, this is for the first time that they have been made for the hearing impaired in Mumbai.The teenager came up with the idea when he saw his parents – both dentists – wear personal protective equipment (PPE) kits and masks to work.“As my mother is a paediatric dentist, I realised that children would be scared to see her in PPE kits and masks. But if they could at least see her smile, then they wouldn’t fear her,” he said. Arnav then approached Meemansa, a clothing manufacturing company, and requested them to make masks that are see-through. While each mask costs ₹25, Arnav has been providing them for free to the NGOs, and also intends to send some funds he has collected through crowd funding for rehabilitation of those affected by the cyclone.“While most of our workers had left for their hometowns, 120 of them had been stuck in the city. We had managed to provide them with food for some time, but after a point we had to work to be able to pay them. Manufacturing of these special masks had required a lot of research because we needed the right kind of plastic to make them. In the end, we were able to manage,” said Priyanka Bapna, owner of Meemansa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-teen-collects-2-1-lakh-distributes-1-200-masks-to-hearing-impaired/story-fbGyCsShXWJWZ8EG0IXgOO.html

The team inquired about the reasons behind the spike and the steps taken to flatten the curve. “The officials visited containment zones in Mumbra as well as the new hospital which is being set up at Kausa stadium. They also visited the containment zones and fever clinics in Lokmanyanagar area, where a high number of cases have been reported. The officials had also been to the Covid Care Centre in New Horizon School at Ghodbunder Road. They have taken a note of all the preventive steps and plan of action we have taken to deal with the increasing number of cases,” deputy municipal commissioner Sandeep Malvi said.The officials have asked the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) to ensure that all safety norms are strictly followed in the city, after they found that some of the workers deployed to set up a 1,000-bed hospital in Kausa had not taken proper measures and were without masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. An officer from health department said, “The team pointed out that some of the workers had not been wearing PPE kits and masks and asked us to ensure that everyone, especially medical staffers are provided with adequate protective gears. The three-member team had also asked us to carry out rapid testing in areas where the number of cases is more and to ensure that the high-risk contacts of positive patients are quarantined strictly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/centre-s-covid-19-team-visits-thane-s-containment-zones/story-XPOG1WquHMOCGv8z2bWRNP.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||9 ham radio operators come to the aid of district officials during Cyclone Nisarga||As all modes of communication collapsed in less than half-an-hour after severe cyclone Nisarga made landfall over Raigad district last Wednesday, a group of nine independent ham radio operators using wireless communication became the eyes and ears for the district administration. Their centres? A station without a roof in Shrivardhan, the district headquarters in Alibag and vehicles in Mahabaleshwar. The entire exercise from the afternoon of June 2 to June 5 evening (when mobile network availability returned in some areas) saw continuous relay of information about deaths, injuries, evacuations, scale of damage (trees loss, falling power lines, and network towers), relief and rehabilitation requirements, across low-lying areas in Shrivardhan, Mhasala, Dighi, Murud, Revdanda, Nagaon, Revas, and Alibag areas in Raigad from the police, local authorities and citizens to radio operators and in turn to the authorities across different parts.The 130-year-old ham or amateur radios is usually used to establish an emergency communication network during natural calamities. The technology developed in the early 1890s in Italy, and was extensively used for the first time before and during World War I (1914-1918).Pre-empting a collapse in communication lines due to the cyclone, the Raigad disaster management officials on June 1 reached out to Nitin Ainapure, a ham radio operator for the past 30 years. “When we were alerted about an impending cyclone, our biggest worry was what if we are cut off from all network connectivity? Ham radio came as an answer to this. We requested ham radio operators and they were more than willing to activate their network of volunteers. Their sets were set up in my office and all coastal tehsils. When the Nisarga hit Raigad, the telecom network was off in Shrivardhan, Murud, Mhasla and Tala. Ham radio volunteers played a pivotal role in ensuring constant information flow from the affected tehsils,” said Nidhi Choudhari, Raigad collector and district magistrate.Based out of Kolhapur, Ainapure was directed to assemble a team to keep wireless systems going before and after the storm. Ainapure was part of communications network during the Kolhapur-Sangli floods last year, 2005 floods in Mumbai, and during cyclone Phyan in November 2009.“Though cyclone Phyan was more intense, its movement was more over the sea before reaching Gujarat. However, it did not cause as much devastation as Nisarga,” said Ainapure.By June 2, teams were in place and trial runs began. The first team at Shrivardhan city included Amol Deshpande, Sunil Unde, Yogesh Sadare, and Chandu Chavan, the second from Wilson Point in Mahabaleshwar led by Ainapure and Bhau Chaugule, and the third from the collector’s office as headquarters in Alibag led by visually impaired ham radio operator Dilip Bapat, Amit Gurav and Mandar Gupte. “While Bapat only has 10% vision since 2015, his hearing ability is best among all of us. He can deduce codes, muffled messages, and relay them immediately to authorities concerned,” said Chaugule.On June 3 (day of landfall), the Alibag team used the police’s wireless system while other teams used antennae kept at a height of 10m for smooth signal transmission atop a hill in Mahabaleshwar and a building in Shrivardhan. The team at Mahabaleshwar and Shrivardhan were charging their systems using their vehicle engines as there was no electricity. “When the cyclone made landfall, one of the antennae in Mahabaleshwar broke, and the signal transmission to Raigad collapsed. A similar incident happened in Shrivardhan,” said Ainapurne, adding that amid the storm both groups ensured antennae were fixed. “Anything could have happened. We were lucky to have made it through,” said Deshpande, adding that the Shirvardhan station sustained severe damages with no rooftop and a partially dilapidated building due to the cyclone.Sagar Pathak, disaster management officer, Raigad said, “Using information given to us, we were able to direct the National Disaster Response Force to the spots, provide immediate restoration measures, and ensure major roads were functional again. As there was a blackout in communications post the cyclone, this information allowed us to prepare preliminary damage assessments.”Experts have mixed views about the technology. “Ham radios are not necessarily the only mode of communication during calamities. Satellite phones, very high and ultra-high frequency networks are all available modes. Ham radios are the last resort when everything else fails,” said Mahesh Narvekar, chief officer, disaster management cell, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation.G Padmanabhan, former emergency analyst, United Nations Development Programme, said, “Using ham radio is part of the standard operating procedure during any calamity. This is a robust system that does not easily get disconnected or disrupted during disasters. Where satellite phones and other equipment have their limitations, this remains a reliable and effective tool for communication frequently being used across Odisha, Kerala, and Maharashtra.” HOW THE TEAM WORKSEach team member is identified with a unique code. For example, Ainapure is VU2CAN while Deshpande is VU2YZO. “This helps us identify each other and the location faster. At the same time, rather than using long words that may or may not be comprehended, we use codes to ensure the message is received. When we say ‘QSL’ it means ‘did you read me?’, and if we get a response saying ‘QSL’, it means the message has been received. QTH means where do you live. One sided battery outage is reduced through this,” said Ainapure. Deshpande said the three-hour landfall completion over Shrivardhan to Murud was the ‘golden period’ when only the ham radio network was functioning and nothing else. “The cyclone had moved Shrivardhan first by splitting from the sea, and then again moving back into the sea, and finally making landfall over Diveagar. During this time, our antenna survived a massive wind speed of 120 kmph, while we were taking shelter in our vehicles,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/9-ham-radio-operators-come-to-the-aid-of-district-officials-during-cyclone-nisarga/story-WUM4gMzAjaLJoSxcJ7URZJ.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Mahrashtra Governor-CM tussle over exams: Colleges, students worried||A week after the Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that all final-year undergraduate and postgraduate exams have been called off and that students will be promoted based on aggregate scores in earlier semester exams, state Governor and chancellor of all state universities Bhagat Singh Koshiyari questioned the move. Koshyari said the cancellation of exams would jeopardise the students’ future and that exams should be held in order to promote students.Stuck in between the “political stand-off”, colleges and universities are looking at a mammoth task ahead. Conducting exams for close to 9 lakh students across the state, including 2.3 lakh students affiliated with the University of Mumbai (MU), can prove problematic, especially since exams will need to be held ensuring appropriate social distancing and taking into account lockdown regulations that could still be in force at the time.“We are talking about colleges spread across the state, and to ensure social distancing during exams, universities will need to add more education institutes as exam centres to accommodate all. What if students refuse to appear for exams still?” asked a former MU official, who currently holds a senior role at a management institute. He added that even if the universities and affiliated colleges ensure exams are held maintaining social distancing, conducting exams so late in the year will have adverse effects on the next academic year as well.Teachers too have raised concerns over how the assessment will take place and how much time the process could take. “For MU alone, teachers will end up assessing over 13 lakh answer sheets that need to be scanned and uploaded on the software, after which they reach teachers for assessment. It will be impossible to ensure that all exams and results will be announced within a month,” said a senior professor at a suburban college. The Maharashtra Federation of University and College Teachers’ Organisation (MFUCTO) has already written to the state government as well as the MU about their concerns of how the delay in conducting exams and the wait for eventual results will affect students’ prospects.“The university is an autonomous body with its own set of statutes to follow in any type of emergency, and the university has the power to decide how they want to conduct examinations. Since the current scenario is grave in nature, he university has the authority to seek help from Maharashtra government to help with their decision. The governor, on the other hand, is a nominal entity and shoudl not dictate the working of a university,” said Tapati Mukhopadhyay president MFUCTO. She added that a university takes two-three months to prepare for examination and since university as well as colleges have been shut for almost three months now, it’ll be impossible for the university to conduct examinations next month. “We stand by the CM’s decision,” she added.Engineering institutes too have expressed concern about holding examinations and in the bargain, further delaying the start of the next academic year. “All final-year Bachelor of Engineering (BE) students who were offered jobs earlier this year are now worried because the employers are expecting students to join their workforce. Without a passing certificate or a temporary replacement for the document, this process will be difficult for all. We urge the government to clarify its stand soon,” said Gopakumaran Thampi, principal of Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra.Several student organisations have asked that the health and sanity of students be prioritised. “A degree certificate is awarded to students based on their performance throughout three years and not holding one final exam will not change much. This insistence on final exams during a global health crisis needs to be reconsidered by the government, especially keeping the lives of students in mind,” said Salman Ahmed, president of Student Islamic Organisation (SIO), South Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mahrashtra-governor-cm-tussle-over-exams-colleges-students-worried/story-4xOGWvoCHMCfR0uhcofDDJ.html

08-06-2020||City||‘Beware of scamsters posing as Covid lab personnel’||Vighnesh Sudhir Worlikar, 27, a resident of Roadpali in Navi Mumbai escaped becoming the victim of fraud by sheer due diligence. Worlikar, an engineer with a shipping company, was made to take a mandatory Covid-19 test before resuming work but was later contacted by a fraud posing as a lab personnel, who claimed he had tested positive for the virus and would need to allow access to his home for disinfection. “I had to join my shipping company from Monday and before joining the office, a mandatory Covid test was to be done through a lab in Andheri. I got my test done on Friday and was waiting for the reports which were expected to be released on Saturday,” said Worlikar. On Saturday, he received a call from an unknown caller who claimed he worked with the testing lab. The person asked for Worlikar’s entire travel history of the past few months and then told him that according to test reports, he had Covid-19.The caller claimed that since the 27-year-old did not reflect any symptoms and was asymptomatic, he would only require an injection and for his entire house to be disinfected.“Unknowingly, I shared my address, details of whom I was staying with, etc. I told the caller that before they come to my house I need to inform the office that I will not be able to join as I had tested positive. I immediately called my boss who laughed at what I said and told me that he had copies of the reports and that I had tested negative,” said Worlikar.He then called the person posing as a lab employee to inform him that his reports were negative and question why he had claimed that they were positive. The unknown caller later switched off his phone for the rest of the day.Though Worlikar did not file any complaint with the police, he did inform them of the incident. Police officers are now appealing to people to be aware and not fall into such traps.Satish Gaikwad, senior inspector, Kalamboli police station, said, “Though there has been no formal complaint, there has been a discussion about the same. The antisocial elements are making this pandemic an opportunity to try and cheat people. The only valid agency to make a call in such cases is the civic body or police. People should ensure that they cross-verify such callers and inform about such calls to the nearest police station immediately,” said Gaikwad.The officer went on to explain more preventive steps that can be taken in such instances. “Don’t let unknown people enter your home or society. Till now, there has been no injection for treating Covid infection. To get authentic information about the Covid infection, line of treatment and hospitals, call the helpline numbers given by the civic body and police,” he said.People have been advised to ask for a valid identity card if somebody walks in for disinfecting the society or home. Society committee members should always be kept in the loop and call the police immediately if they suspect fraud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/beware-of-scamsters-posing-as-covid-lab-personnel/story-WGvD3E4DGj512DXt3HfdXO.html

08-06-2020||City||KDMC issues guidelines for housing societies||Residents of Kalyan-Dombivli can now refer to housing guidelines published by the Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) regarding allowing domestic help to resume work during the Covid-19 pandemic along with other safety measures. KDMC published the guidelines on its website and social media. The guidelines comprise of measures to be followed at the main gate of housing complexes, how to use the elevator, how to check common places, directives for domestic help, how to deal with persons returning from other states or cities. “Recently a family returned from Madhya Pradesh and we were clueless about whether to allow them inside the society without any checking. We called up the civic body and one doctor arrived and checked them and allowed them inside the society,” said Mangesh Borade, 47, a resident of a housing society in Rambaug, Kalyan (West).KDMC commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi has appealed to housing societies to keep a thermal gun and pulse oximeter at the entrance and check every person returning to the society from outside.“Those coming from outside the state or from other cities can be allowed inside the housing society once they get screened at the gate,” said Suryavanshi.Residents have also been unsure about the quarantine period for those returning from outside the city.“There is no need for quarantine if the person doesn’t have symptoms. Also, when people are travelling from other states they are already tested for any symptoms at state checkpoints. In case of any symptoms, they should approach KDMC without delay or visit the nearest primary health care center for a test,” said KDMC epidemic officer Pratibha Panpatil.Some of the other guidelines by KDMC for housing societies include setting up banners and hoardings on wearing masks and using sanitisers inside the complexes. Societies have been instructed to display emergency helpline numbers for residents, set up handwash stations, and designate a common delivery room near the gate.Yogesh Singh, 33, a resident of Guru Atman Residency, Gauripada, Kalyan (West), said, “Residents had pointed out that infection could spread from the housekeeping staff, so we fixed the staff for our wings and they are screened regularly. We have fixed the entry and exit points at the main gate as well.”House-help have also been asked to clean their hands and legs before entering the house, use a dedicated tray for their belongings, wear a mask while working, and in case the house-help has symptoms, they should remain home for 14 days.Plumbers, electricians, and mechanics visiting housing societies should also wear masks while working, clean their hands and legs, avoid unnecessarily touching any objects in the complex, and opt for e-payment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kdmc-issues-guidelines-for-housing-societies/story-8L4VQqZluObGhR6tL8nAcM.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Air India subsidiary to provide jobs for relatives of staff who succumbed to Covid-19||Air India’s ground handling subsidiary, Air India Airport Services Ltd (AIASL), will provide jobs to a family member of employees who succumb to the coronavirus, said a notice issued by the company on Saturday.The notice comes after a 58-year-old Air India (AI) pilot, who retired in April this year, died on June 5 due to suspected Covid-19. Though the retired employee’s family is not eligible for a job, unions had raised the demand. The notice signed by the general manager (personnel) read, “In view of this national crisis, it has been decided by the competent authority of AIASL that the company, on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, will render support the family of the deceased employees [due to Covid-19)] from AIASL, Air India or its subsidiaries, by giving suitable employment to a family member.”The letter stated that during the nationwide lockdown due to the Covid-19 pandemic, AIASL staff have handled around 1,895 flights from March 25 to June 4, and have been supporting cargo operations under the Central government’s regional connectivity scheme — Udey Desh Ka Aam Naagarik (UDAN). The staffers have also handled flights under the Vande Bharat mission.AIASL, headed by ex-Air India executive director Ashvini Sharma, also announced that the employment provided will be as per the terms of engagement in the company and at the airports which are served by the company.AIASL offers ground handling services to 81 airports in the country. JB Kadian, general secretary of Air India’s largest employee union — Air Corporation Employees Union (ACEU) — had written to the airline’s chairman and managing director Rajiv Bansal on May 30, urging AI to include staff members attached to its subsidiaries in the medical insurance cover for Covid-19 frontline warriors.“Air India and its subsidiary staff do not find any mention in the scheme announced by the government and equally surprising is the fact that they do not find any mention in the welfare insurance schemes of the airline. We would request you to be kind enough to include these staff of Air India and ensure implementation of the insurance scheme in line with and in the same manner as is announced by the government for Covid-19 frontline warriors,” the letter stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/air-india-subsidiary-to-provide-jobs-for-relatives-of-staff-who-succumbed-to-covid-19/story-m25oEkUgT6r79VbiyukaTL.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Another blow after the storm: No water to drink in cyclone-hit areas||Four days after severe cyclonic storm Nisarga made landfall in Raigad, residents of semi-urban and rural areas in the affected talukas are still facing drinking water crisis.Shrivardhan, Murud and Mangaon areas, which are close to the cyclone landfall site, are facing a shortage of safe drinking water, said district officials. “There is a serious shortage of drinking water supply to most areas, mostly because of electricity being badly affected,” said Nidhi Choudhari, district collector and magistrate, Raigad. “Based on discussions with the state electricity board, we expect power resumption in another four to five days in majority of the eight affected talukas.”While pipelines carrying water to homes across major towns have been damaged during the cyclone, pumping water from borewells is also no more an option since there is no power.Saurabh Kudekar, a resident of Tala town in Mangaon, said for the last three days he and his 68-year-old father Rajendra had to walk for two hours to get water from an uncontaminated well in the outskirts of the town. “We have now decided to rent a generator which costs ₹1,000 for two hours with an additional cost of diesel. With already having to pay for house repairs, machinery for cutting and removing fallen trees as well as the fear of Covid-19 pandemic, this is a disastrous period for us,” said Kudekar. “Some people in our town have also bought power generators for drinking water supply,” he added.However, for residents of isolated villages closer to Murud and Shrivardhan, power generators were not an option, said residents. “The local administration had told each household in our village to stock up on drinking water for at least two to three days after the cyclone. We had done that but now we are running out, and so far not one person from the district administration or local tehsildar level has come to our aid yet,” said Dattatreya Karanje, a resident of Aravi village, Shrivardhan.Sadanand Wagre from Rajapuri in Murud taluka said several power generators, which are used during television and film shooting, are available. “Authorities can use them for the time being to supply electricity in affected areas for drinking water. Also, dysfunctional tubewells in villages far from the coast need to be fixed as they are not even aware of how long electricity or mobile networks will not be available to them,” Wagare said.The district collector said the provision of providing generators across affected locations had begun from Sunday under the regional rural water supply schemes. “The process to supply generators is underway for remaining areas as well. We are also sending tankers to fill the village wells. Water quality checking of these wells is being done by gram panchayats before advising anyone to use them as drinking water source,” said Choudhari.The two National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) officers, who were injured during tree removal operations on Saturday, are both out of danger, said officials.“On Sunday, we carried out a massive exercise of clearing all village roads in Shrivardhan. We have already established a minimal mobile phone network there, and hundreds of generators have been sent under the water supply schemes. By Monday, we expect to finally assess final property damages, loss of trees and electric lines,” said Choudhari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/another-blow-after-the-storm-no-water-to-drink-in-clone-hit-areas/story-gMDlXcz03v3vkDZHEWjygP.html

Raut claimed Sood was a BJP stooge and prospective star campaigner for the party.In his piece titled ‘Ekta Sonu Sood Khara’ (Only Sonu Sood Is Real), Raut indicated that it was the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) which was helping the actor from behind the scenes to make him a “Mahatma”.“What machinery did he [Sood] have to send thousands of workers to their home [states]? The one who was behind this is Shankar Pawar. He is the chief of the Rashtriya Banjara Seva Sangh but he is merely a face,” Raut wrote in his weekly ‘Rokhtok’ column.BJP has slammed Raut for his comments. Party leader Ram Kadam said Shiv Sena’s statement on Sood is “condemnable” and “unfortunate”.“The MVA government led by the Shiv Sena has failed in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic in the state. And when it [the work] is being done by an actor like Sonu Sood, who is on the roads and helping people with his own money, you will make false charges against him,” Kadam said.The Congress party also criticised Raut for his remarks. National party spokesperson Abhishek Singhvi, in a tweet, said that citizens who help should be welcomed and encouragedThe Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) did not comment on Raut’s column but commended Sood for his work. “We will appreciate whoever takes such good initiatives, be it Sood or anyone else,” said state home minister and NCP leader Anil Deshmukh.On Sunday evening Sood met chief minister Uddhav Thackeray at his Bandra residence ‘Matoshree’. He was accompanied by Aslam Shaikh, guardian minister of Mumbai city.“They all are very supportive. It was not about any political party. We have to support all the people. There was no misunderstanding. Everyone wants to do good for the country and we are here for them,” the actor said after the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shiv-sena-leader-sanjay-raut-criticises-mahatma-sonu-sood-bjp-hits-back/story-WVaF5jEyERjCUbjiovpLZM.html

Last month, 73 cases were registered under similar charges on the complaint of 76 people deported by the US. On June 2, another flight with 66 people from Haryana had landed in India. While 22 FIRs have been registered in Karnal, 12 were filed in Kaithal, 11 in Ambala, nine in Kurukshetra and four in Panipat. Karnal IGP Bharti Arora, who is heading the seven-member special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe these cases, said, “Sixty-two more FIRs have been registered against travel agents on the complaint of people sent back from the US in the second flight.” “Six such agents have so far been put behind bars and as the investigation progresses, more arrests are likely,” she added. The IGP said most of the complaints were received from Karnal, Kaithal, Ambala and Kurukshetra districts. “The SIT is also collecting details of all pending cases of illegal immigration in the state as per the directions and the travel agents involved in illegal activities will face action,” she added. On the violation of the Emigration Act by the deportees, the IGP said the police will not take any action against them as most of them had lost everything and even sold their land to pay the travel agents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/immigration-fraud-62-more-firs-registered-against-travel-agents-in-haryana/story-1uslfyvPPbNpuAJh0jFaZK.html

08-06-2020||Chandigarh||Outstation students in a tizzy over examinations at Panjab University, affiliated colleges||As chaos and confusion persists amid surging cases of Covid-19, the outstation students studying at Panjab University and its affiliated colleges in Chandigarh say that they are worried about how and when examinations will be conducted.In Chandigarh, sizeable number of student belongs to Haryana, Punjab, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu and Kashmir. In the city’s 11 colleges, around 25,000 students are outstation candidates whereas in PU, the number stands around 9,000, as per the recent National Institutional Ranking Framework data.Rishabh Kumar, a second year student from Himachal Pradesh said, “Right now we are confused over when the exams will be conducted. I don’t know when I have to start going to college.”Simran Kaur from Punjab said “My friends and I decided to vacate our paying guest accommodations as they were empty for months. Now if they declare that they are holding the examination, we will have to find a place to live immediately.”“My parents are worried as Covid-19 cases are increasing at an alarming rate and we will have to visit Chandigarh which is a red zone,” she added.Saurav Sharma, another student from HP added, “Not only are students worried about shelter and food, but no online classes have also been held. The syllabus is incomplete and students are not prepared to take exams. Many of us are worried that we will fail. The anxiety and fear is very real.”PU, on the other hand, says that they are doing their best to reach out to students.Parvinder Singh, PU’s controller of examination, said there are more than 200 distress calls for clarification at the helpdesk daily. He said around 800 to 900 queries have been dealt with already.“I have instructed my staff to classify all queries into categories including genuine, priority, regular and fake which will be put up on the university’s website,” the registrar said.The distress among students has been further aggravated by multiple fake circulars and posts about exams that are doing the rounds on social media. Singh said multiple FIRs have been registered against those spreading such fake news. “In fact, in one of the fake circulars, my signature was also forged,” he said.He further clarified, “In line with the government of India guidelines, examination for outgoing classes (final year students) will be conducted now. Considering the academic loss, students will be given 70 % choice in the examination,” Singh said. “At least 20 days time will be given to students before the examination starts.

08-06-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra Covid-19 count crosses China’s tally||Maharashtra on Sunday recorded 3,007 more coronavirus cases, a day before private offices in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) open after being shut for close to three months, under the third phase of the government’s Mission Begin Again. With its second single-day spike of over 3,000 cases ( the state had reported 3,041 cases on May 24), India’s worst-hit state’s tally now stands at 85,975 cases, taking it past China’s total of 83, 036 cases, according to data by worldometers.info.The city of Wuhan in China is the original epicentre of the coronavirus outbreak late last year. Maharashtra’s first case was reported on March 9 this year.The death toll of the state also breached the bleak 3,000 mark after 91 casualties were reported on Sunday.From Monday, the state government, under a staggered plan to unlock Maharashtra. has allowed private offices to operate with 10% strength or 10 people, whichever is more, with the remaining working from home. It has directed that all employers will have to take up a sensitisation program to educate employees about adequate precautions on returning home so that the vulnerable group, especially the elderly, is not affected.Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) is also resuming its bus operations from today after a gap of three months to facilitate office-goers, said officials. Around 2,000 buses are expected to ply on the roads, while maintaining social distancing between commuters inside the buses. The new commuting conditions state that only 30 passengers are allowed to board a BEST bus from Monday, which will include 25 sitting and five standing. One passenger each will be allowed to sit on the left and right sides of the bus. Of Monday’s reported deaths, 30 of them were in the past two days, while the rest were between May 3 and June 3, clarified the state government. Mumbai has recorded 61 deaths, highest in a day so far. On Saturday, the city has recorded 58 deaths, which was the highest till yesterday. The city’s toll reached 1,638. The worst-hit Indian city also saw addition of 1,420 infections on Sunday, which took its count to 48,774, of which less than half — 21,190 — are active ones. The state has 43,951 active cases.State officials are expecting a surge in cases in the wake of the fresh relaxations, but are also hopeful that the curve will flatten in around 10 days. Dr Sanjay Oak, head of a task-force comprising 11 doctors constituted by the government for the clinical management of critically ill patients, said the flattening of the curve is expected by June 17. “I look at Wuhan where the flattening of the curve was witnessed on the 72nd or 76th day of the lockdown. By that parameter, we are expecting it in the next ten days. We also expect herd immunity to develop among people in the next few days,” Dr Oak said.“There will be a rise in cases over the next ten days in Mumbai owing to the fresh relaxations and resumption of activities, but there is no need to worry as our health infrastructure is ready to deal with the situation,” he further said. The state has asked authorities to brace for a spike in cases, with relaxations including inter-district travel within MMR and re-categorisation of red zones to only 18 cities. “Most of the patients who tested positive for the virus in the rural parts and semi-urban areas of the state are those who have travelled from big cities such as Mumbai and Pune. The authorities have been directed to monitor the influx minutely to contain the spread from these travellers,” said a senior official, wishing not to be named.State health minister Rajesh Tope, however, said that the recovery rate has been improving as 39,314 patients have recovered and been discharged from various hospitals so far. “The recovery rate now has reached 45.72%. On Sunday, 1924 patients have recovered,” Tope said.The health minister said 5,51,647 tests have been conducted at various public and private facilities across Maharashtra. Of them, 4,65,672 people tested negative. It means, only 15.58% of the total cases are positive.Meanwhile, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has made significant changes for Covid-19 testing and has issued fresh guidelines on Sunday. “All direct and high-risk contacts of confirmed cases quarantined at home are to be tested between the fifth and tenth day of coming in contact with a patient. All such patients can directly approach the laboratories for home collection of swabs, for which no prescription will be required,” said the guidelines.“If any of the direct or high-risk contacts of patients develops symptoms in less than five days of coming in contact then he or she can be home tested immediately by giving self-attestation. Hospitals requiring Covid testing of suspected patients shall be entitled to do so directly through the laboratory and test reports can be shared with the hospital directly. However, laboratory shall have to inform the epidemiology cell as well,” it stated further.The BMC has also directed all laboratories to ensure that the results of all swabs taken by them are received within 24 hours only. This shall be observed with zero tolerance by the BMC.State currently has 3,654 active containment zones. A total of 18,515 survey teams, comprising doctors and assisting staff, have screened more than 69.60 lakh people.So far, 28,504 people have been kept in institutional quarantine in the state and over 5,58,463 people have been put under home quarantine.The state health department on Saturday, allowed home quarantine for Covid-19 patients with no or very mild symptoms. The norm, which was applicable in Mumbai, has now been allowed across the state. Patients with adequate facilities for home isolation will be allowed to home quarantine for 17 days, starting from the day samples are taken for the test. The home quarantine can be ended if the patient is not developing fever in ten days. Dedicated caretaker for such a patient has been made mandatory, said the notification issued by health secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-19-count-crosses-china-s-tally/story-ycVETembsmwzKay1zSKDNM.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Source of foul smell in suburbs not known yet, says civic body||A day after the mysterious foul smell was reported from some parts of the eastern and western suburbs on Saturday night, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) said it was unable to identify the source of the odour.After an extensive search for the source of the smell, suspected to be a gas leak, which went on for four to five hour in localities from where the complaints were received, the Mumbai Fire Brigade called off the inspection on Sunday early morning. The fire brigade had deputed 17 fire engines and senior fire officers for an investigation and searched areas in the periphery of up to two kilometres from the location of callers’ addresses.Regarding an investigation into the Saturday’s incident, a senior civic official said, “No decision about it has yet been taken. We will look into the matter.” BMC’s disaster management control room on Saturday received nine complaints from residents of Chembur, Mankhurd, Ghatkopar (East), Ghatkopar (West), Powai, Andheri, Kanjurmarg and Vikhroli about a foul pungent odour, giving rise to the suspicions of a gas leak. In a series of tweets on Saturday, BMC said, “Situation is under control. All necessary resources have been mobilised. Origin of the smell is being investigated. Seventeen fire appliances are on field equipped with a public announcement system and ready for a response if required.”The civic body had earlier suspected that the smell originated from the US Vitamin Company near Indira Apartment in Govandi (East). However, chief fire officer P Rahangdale said, “We investigated the entire premises and nearby areas of US Vitamin Company but could not detect a leak.” US Vitamins later on Sunday issued a statement and said, “We wish to clarify that no foul smell emanated from our Govandi facility, as reported by certain sections of the media. The facility was fully checked by our safety team. We request media to refrain from linking our name to this episode.”The Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Limited (HPCL), Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited (BPCL), Mahanagar Gas Ltd (MGL), Rashtriya Chemicals & Fertilizers (RCF) and Mumbai police have been asked to remain on alert.This is the second incident in the span of less than one year, where residents of Mumbai’s suburbs complained of a foul odour. The civic body’s disaster management department had received 37 complaints from 15 locations of suspected gas leakages in September 2019 and the fire brigade had got 50 calls. Some citizens had also reported about a suspected gas leakage to the police. However, the source could not be confirmed following a thorough investigation by a special committee set up for the purpose last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/source-of-foul-smell-in-suburbs-not-known-yet-says-civic-body/story-M0mef7jChAxjJy814nyqDO.html

Three people battling Covid-19 died in Faridabad district, while one person died in Panipat. Gurugram continued the trend of throwing grim figures as 230 fresh cases were recorded in this NCR district on Sunday, followed by 73 in Sonepat and 56 in Faridabad, the other two NCR hotspots. At least 72% (359 cases) of new infections recorded in Haryana on Sunday came from Gurugram, Sonepat and Faridabad. At least 25 cases each were reported in Rohtak and Narnaul. In Nuh, 17 cases were detected, while 15 people tested positive in Bhiwani and 11 in Panipat. Among other districts, Karnal saw eight cases, followed by Ambala (7) Palwal, Panchkula and Fatehabad (5 each), Hisar (4), Rewari (3), Jhajjar (2), and Jind, Yamunanagar, Sirsa, Kurukshetra and Kaithal (1 each). VIJ HITS OUT AT KEJRIWALHealth minister Anil Vij on Sunday said Haryana government will also treat Covid-19 patients of other states. He said Haryana will not be “harsh” like Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who has announced to reserve the hospitals run by the Delhi government for locals only. “We cannot deny treatment to anyone…who is from outside Haryana... We cannot be harsh like Kejriwal,” Vij said, pointing out that in past few days, many people had contacted him informing that they were not getting beds in the national capital. Responding to a question, Vij said there was no community spread in any districts of the state. Though the health bulletin only mentioned four deaths, a 70-year-old man from Rajound succumbed to virus at the Khanpur Kalan medical college. Kaithal chief medical officer Rakesh Sehl said the patient had gone to the hospital a few days ago for treatment. He was diabetic and was tested positive on June 4. A 64-year-old woman from Sunshine County area admitted to Bhagat Phool Singh medical college also died of Covid-19. Sonepat DC Shyam Lal said she had tested positive on June 5. Mahendergarh, meanwhile, witnessed 25 new cases as well.165 NEW CASES EMERGE IN SONEPAT IN THREE DAYS Emergence of 165 new Covid-19 cases in last three days has placed Sonepat on the list of worst-hit districts in Haryana after Gurugram and Faridabad. The district’s tally climbed to 424 on Sunday. Sonepat civil surgeon BK Rajoura said most of the cases have been reported from Rai, Kundli and Ganaur areas. “The new patients are either Delhi-returnees or their contacts. Majority of the contacts of infected people who tested positive are asymptomatic,” he added. The civil surgeon said they were prepared to tackle the sudden surge in cases and have facilities with total 820 beds ready for patients in various parts of the district. “We will add 500 more beds by next week,” he added. Sonepat deputy commissioner Shyam Lal Punia said, “We have decided to turn two hostels of Bhagat Phool Singh Medical College for Women into Covid healthcare centres. The health department has already constituted block-level teams for sampling.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-logs-new-high-of-496-cases-in-a-day-47-from-gurugram-alone/story-7ZOyITbWqBkp6uiQxVewrJ.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Break-in at mobile phone shop in Kurla, items worth ₹8 lakh stolen||The Kurla police on Sunday registered a house-breaking and theft case after unknown robbers broke into a mobile store in Kurla. The robbers used a gas-cutter to get inside the shop and took away 52 mobile phones and accessories worth ₹7.99 lakh. According to the police, the theft took place at Top-10 mobile shop at the station road in Kurla (West). The incident took place in the night between Saturday and Sunday. “The thieves used a gas cutter to cut the shutter of the shop. They took away 52 mobile phones and accessories worth ₹7.99 lakh,” said a police officer. According to the police, the complainant, Vivek Navin Satra, 28, is the manager of the shop. The incident took place in-between 4pm on Saturday to 10am on Sunday. “Total 52 mobile phones of different companies, 19 demo mobiles phones, mobile accessories, ₹5,000 cash and DVR of CCTV footage was robbed,” said a police officer. The owners claim that the shop was closed since the lockdown started in March. “We suspect some local or known person who was aware of the shop may have committed the crime. We are trying to get CCTV footage, but are yet to get,” said a police officer. Senior police inspector Dattarey Shinde along with police inspector and staff visited the spot after the incident. The case is being investigated by police sub-inspector N Patil. A case was registered under sections 454, 457 (house-breaking) and 380 (theft) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/break-in-at-mobile-phone-shop-in-kurla-items-worth-8-lakh-stolen/story-qVhtMerhW89vPcCTedahxH.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Fever cases drop by 64%, civic body says referred patients to special clinics||Fever cases in the city have reduced by 64% in the last two months, states the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). For the first time since 2016, Mumbai has reported as low as 1,700 fever cases in a month. The civic body claims that such a dip was because people with fever were referred to Covid-19 fever clinics for symptomatic treatment. However, activists claim that due to the lockdown, several patients failed to reach hospitals.According to the data provided by Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), in the first five months, the city reports an average of 3,000 fever cases. After an initial rise in the number of fever cases to 4,749 in March this year, it dropped steeply in April to 1,703, a 64% decrease. In May, the number marginally increased to 1,745.As fever is considered the main symptom of Covid-19, suspected patients rushed to hospitals in a large number.“The inflow of patients with fever-like symptoms doubled at civic and private-run hospitals. In the initial days, several societies and officers were also demanding non-Covid certificates from people with fever. Thus, we decided to form fever clinics to bifurcate the suspected patients,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC.When fever clinics started coming up in the city, all symptomatic patients were referred to these centers. “All patients with fever were referred to these clinics for examinations. Thus, we witnessed a dip in fever patients,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.However, health activists have refuted the civic body’s claims. They state that due to unavailability of vehicles and closure of OPDs, the patients were forced to take medicines over the counter.“With the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, people got scared and they even refused to visit a hospital for treatment because of the fear of getting quarantined. Also, all the nearby private clinics closed down, they had to be dependent on chemist shops for medications,” said Dr Ravikant Singh, a city-based health activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fever-cases-drop-by-64-civic-body-says-referred-patients-to-special-clinics/story-9uqxrpDyg37kAo0sORmQiJ.html
08-06-2020||City||As Covid pandemic rages, fashion industry adjusts to the ‘new normal’||As state governments relax Covid-related lockdown conditions and allow commercial activity, many clothing stores have opened their doors, promising safe shopping experience, but there are no takers.When it comes to clothing, most people prefer brick and mortar stores to online shops, because they would like to touch and feel the fabric and try on the clothes before they buy. After all, it is not necessary that a dress that looks beautiful on a model or a mannequin will look good on you . However, today, the fear of catching the dreaded virus is holding back consumers from visiting these shops. Consumers worry about how many people may have touched the clothes and tried them on and whether any of them was an asymptomatic Covid positive individual. Besides, trying on dresses and tops that you pull over your head is also fraught with danger as the fabric comes in contact with your eyes, nose and mouth - unless you are wearing a mask and a plastic face shield (that may well become a new normal for trying on clothes) . The fact that there is hardly any information on the transmission of Corona virus through clothing or fabrics is also a factor.There is evidence of the virus remaining stable for a few hours to days on various surfaces - on stainless steel and plastic surfaces for two to three days, on cardboard for 24 hours, as per the study published in the New England Journal of Medicine. But on fabric surfaces, unfortunately, there is scant information on how long the virus may remain. Scientists do say that the virus does not survive long on porous material like clothes , unlike non-porous surfaces like plastic. Besides, porous surfaces tend to trap the virus, making transmission tough. In fact the virus becomes inert and disintegrates relatively faster on porous surfaces , they say.But that’s no consolation for consumers worried about their safety, because authentic and accurate information in this area is still lacking and nobody is ruling out the possibility of contamination of an apparel -even for a relatively short duration – if an infected person coughed or sneezed on it or touched it with contaminated hands. In fact experts warn against shaking any fabric that may be contaminated, as it can release the trapped virus into the air.Since no one knows how long the virus will continue to haunt us, fabric and clothing manufacturers are trying out various options to get the consumers back. A suiting material manufacturer for example, has come up with fabric that inhibits the growth and retention of micro organisms-both bacteria and viruses- up to 50 washes. The fashion industry is also trying various ways of sanitizing clothes - with ozone, ultra violet rays, to mention a few. More recently, an apparel brand has been offering its clients, one-on-one exclusive virtual shopping experience. Here, you shop from the safety of your home , yet experience the joy of visiting a brick and mortar store , including the interaction with the shop assistant to help you choose what you want , without the risk of Covid-19, through a video call from the store at a time and on a day convenient to you. Whatever you buy is sent home in a factory-sealed packet.These are certainly difficult times for everyone and it will take considerable effort on the part of the fashion/apparel industry to get consumers to buy clothes-either online or through video shopping - in these times of economic slowdown, earning losses, lockdowns and fear of the virus. Besides, in the absence of socializing, consumers are mostly not interested in buying new clothes. So it’s really a tough challenge for the industry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/as-covid-pandemic-rages-fashion-industry-adjusts-to-the-new-normal/story-iZhxvyx1MbAfRWwFJJ4djN.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||Covid-19: Why is it so difficult to get tested in Delhi?||Most private laboratories in Delhi have either capped the number of people they test in a day or are not collecting samples for some time, making it very difficult to get tested for the coronavirus disease in he capital. Some laboratories said they will start collecting samples from Monday.On Sunday, HT reached out to all 23 private labs recognised by the Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) to check on testing: three said they were closed for Covid-19 testing because of “technical reasons”; two said they had a token system with people coming in early in the morning to give their samples on a first- come-first-served basis; two others had an online appointment scheduling system; eight said they could schedule a test on Monday or later; seven didn’t answer ; and only one said the patient could come and get tested right away.Delhi’s testing protocol is tighter than the Indian Council of Medical Research’s. Tests are restricted to symptomatic individuals. Even direct contacts of infected people can be tested only if they are senior citizens or have co-morbidities. Coronavirus outbreak: Full coverageUnder current rules, a senior official in the chief minister’s office explained, the first stop for a symptomatic individual should be a flu clinic (these are located in all government hospitals and the 10 private hospitals that have so far been identified by the government). There, a doctor inspects the symptoms and recommends a Covid test. A laboratory will accept any application for test only with a doctor’s recommendation.“If the symptoms are mild, the person is assigned home isolation till the result is out. If moderate or severe, then either institutional quarantine or a hospital is recommended, depending on age and presence of co-morbidities. No patient with symptoms can be refused diagnosis by any hospital under an order issued by the (state) health department,” said the official.Delhi currently has 42 labs for Covid tests, of which eight are temporarily suspended from collecting fresh samples.Once the person tests positive or negative, the same factors – nature of symptoms, age, co-morbidities, etc – determine whether the person is assigned home quarantine, sent to institutional quarantine or admitted in a hospital, the official added. It sounds simple on paper but isn’t: people who want to get tested will have to go to a doctor for a prescription for a test, get a referral form signed by that doctor, and then look for a laboratory that will test them.Max Super Speciality Hospital in Saket and BL Kapur Memorial Hospital on Pusa road said they have a token system for tests. At Max hospital, patients have to reach at 7.30am at gate number 3 where samples are collected from the first 40 patients. At BL Kapur, 45 patients are tested, starting at 8 am.City X Ray and Scan Clinic in Tilak Nagar and Lifeline Laboratory in Green Park were not collecting samples on Sunday. The rest said tests can be scheduled depending on whether documents are in place. Some asked for the prescription, Aadhar card and ICMR referral form to be sent on WhatAspp before a test can be scheduled on a later date.Few labs didn’t answer calls—including Genestrings Diagnostic Centre in Sarvodaya Enclave; Gen X diagnostics in Sarvapriya Vihar; Aakash Healthcare and four others. Some of them had a book a test provision on their websites.Eight laboratories in Delhi were banned from carrying out tests after the government pulled them up on June 5 for not following protocol, and, according to the Delhi health minister, they were taking too long to report results. These are Dr Lal Pathlabs, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, Prognosis laboratory, SRL , Fortis , Star Imaging Path laboratory, Pathkind Labs and National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) .That leaves Covid-19 suspect patients with little option but to head to a government hospital where they can get screened and tested. Or the other option is to go to the nearest mohalla (neighbourhood) clinic where a doctor can recommend a test based on severity of symptoms; these tests can happen at the 16 Delhi government test centres. But many may not choose to go directly to a government hospital for the fear of contracting the infection there.Sambhav Bhalla (26), a banker, has locked himself up for the past four days; he suffers from fever, body ache and chills. He developed fever last week on Tuesday. He has called up many hospitals and private labs since then but none agreed to test for “technical reasons”. “I called up a few labs and they said they can’t do the test for now. I will go to a hospital if I feel my condition is deteriorating. I am not even calling government hospitals because I know the situation will be worse there as one of my friend’s uncle passed away and got his Covid test result a week after his death,” he said on Saturday. Bhalla spoke to HT on Thursday but didn’t answer calls on Sunday. He tweeted last week about the difficulties in getting tested.“There are two issues—individual rights and public rights. The individual has the right to get tested in a private facility if he or she feels the need to. In a government facility the government can have a policy to prioritise which cases it will test as public money is being spent. If both sides collapse it’s not good. Whether you finally get tested in private or in a government hospital they should counsel you on what you are supposed to do next based on the results. That is crucial in further spread of the infection,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head, department of community medicine, Safdarjung Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-why-is-it-so-difficult-to-get-tested-in-delhi/story-SoPwKc2l6wZ0UHDjZpJ6TN.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||For now, Delhi hospitals only for city residents: CM Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Sunday beds in hospitals under the Delhi government, and private hospitals — with the exception of those providing specialised surgeries in certain fields — will be reserved for people of Delhi till the Covid-19 crisis subsides, even as he announced that the city’s borders with neighbouring states will be opened on Monday.People from other states can still be treated in the national capital’s hospitals that come under the central government. These include the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Safdarjung Hospital and Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital.On June 1, Kejriwal ordered the closure of Delhi’s borders with Uttar Pradesh and Haryana. On the same day, he sought suggestions from the city’s residents on whether the Capital should open its borders, citing the capacity of Delhi’s health care infrastructure, which he said could get burdened if people from other states were admitted.Citing the feedback from the city’s residents, Kejriwal said on Sunday that around 750,000 people responded, of whom more than 90% said that hospitals in Delhi should only cater to the residents of the city till the pandemic subsides.In a digital news briefing, Kejriwal said the government’s move was aimed at “striking a balance” as Delhi opens its borders with neighbouring states at a time when the city-state is reviving business and economic activities, and restarting public transport, even as daily new cases continue to remain over 1,000 in the recent days.“There will be utter chaos at the hospital’s emergency unit if we were to check the ID card of each patient that lands up here,” said a senior administrative official of a city hospital, asking not to be identified.Other hospitals said they needed to read the formal order to know the exact details of the directive.“We are yet to get the order, and will be in a position to respond once we get the notification,” said a spokesperson for Apollo Hospital. A Fortis Hospital spokesperson, too, said they awaiting the formal order “and will act according to the details”.Dr Sanjay Mehta, unit head and VP, BLK Super Speciality Hospital, also said they were waiting for the formal order to implement the directives. The Delhi government clarified that the directive was not applicable to central government-run hospitals.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has said the Centre’s hospitals in Delhi are trying to accommodate as many patients as possible. “Our hospitals such as AIIMS, Safdarjung, RML and Lady Hardinge are handling a lot of patient load in Delhi, including Covid-19 cases,” he said.The Delhi government, on Wednesday last week, set up a five-member advisory panel headed by Dr Mahesh Verma, vice-chancellor of Indraprastha University, to guide the government with its health care augmentation plan amid an increasing number of Covid-19 cases.Citing the findings of a report submitted by the body to the chief minister’s office on Saturday, Kejriwal said: “The five-member committee assessed the situation and found that by the end of June, Delhi will require around 15,000 beds to treat Corona patients. There are around 10,000 beds each in Delhi government and Centre-run hospitals. The five-member committee has also said that if people from other states are given access to Delhi government hospitals, around 9,000 beds can get occupied within three days.”“So far, the people of Delhi never refused treatment to those from other states, who, at any given point, comprise 60-70% of total patients in Delhi government hospitals. But Covid-19 cases are now rising in the city. The panel has suggested that the beds should be reserved for a few months. The cabinet decided that there is a need to strike a balance. So, we will open up borders and reserve beds in Delhi government hospitals. And the Centre-run hospitals will be for people across the country. The private hospitals will also be reserved for Delhi’s people,” Kejriwal said.“But those conducting specialised surgeries, which are not available elsewhere, especially in the fields of organ transplant, oncology and neurology, will be allowed to admit patients from other states. This balance will protect the rights of people of Delhi as well as those from other states,” he added. Senior officials said the government is in the process of preparing a list of such private hospitals.Delhi has five Covid-19-dedicated government hospitals and 10 such private hospitals. So far, the Capital has a total of 8,049 beds to treat Covid-19 patients.The government has also shortlisted some stadiums, hotels and banquet halls in the city to be used as extended hospital facilities for space augmentation in the days to come. Government records showed, as on June 7, the 15 hospitals collectively had 8,049 beds, of which 4,250 were occupied. These hospitals collectively have 480 ventilators, of which 237 were occupied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/for-now-delhi-hospitals-only-for-city-residents-cm-kejriwal/story-MfokDfbjDy2L7wgelDsk0H.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||Voter ID, drivers’ license among papers required for treatments in Delhi hospitals||The Delhi government on Sunday night issued a list of documents that would make a person eligible to be treated in either a state-run or private hospital, with the exception of those that provide specialised surgeries.The documents are — voter ID; bank or post office passbook, ration card, passport, drivers’ license, income tax return; latest water, telephone or electricity bill issued to the patient or close relative such as parents or spouse; proof of postal department’s posts received with the patient’s name in the given address; Aadhaar card issued prior to June 7; and any such document issued in the name of any of the parents if the patient is a minor, said the order.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Sunday that beds in the city hospitals, including the private ones -- with the exception of which are providing specialised surgeries -- will be reserved for “people of Delhi”. The order, signed by the Delhi health secretary Padmini Singla, reads that the “private hospitals and nursing homes shall ensure that only bona fide residents of Delhi are admitted for treatment in these hospitals.”According to records of the city government’s planning department, the city currently has a population of around 19.1 million, of which, records of the election commission suggests, 14.6 million are eligible voters. The gap, senior officials said, are either minors or residents of the city who vote in other states.The order will now be sent to the office of Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal for approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/voter-id-drivers-licence-among-papers-to-prove-eligibility-for-treatments-in-delhi-hospitals/story-GCVLkLfhf0MvI1z0dZyyFO.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||Liquor to be cheaper in Delhi as govt removes 70% corona fee||The Delhi government from June 10 will withdraw the special 70% coronavirus fees that it has been levying on the maximum retail price (MRP) of liquor, a senior government official said Sunday. The decision was taken in a cabinet meeting chaired by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday. The cabinet note, which HT has seen, further said, value added tax (VAT) on liquor sold in Delhi will be increased from 20% to 25%.VAT is applicable on all Indian manufactured foreign liquor and country liquor. Prices of imported liquor – on which several other duty fees are levied – are likely to witness no change in MRP after June 10.The special ‘coronavirus fee’ was imposed by the Delhi excise department on May 3, the day government liquor shops in the city — which are not located in markets and shopping malls — were allowed to open after around six weeks of lockdown. Around 100 shops that were allowed to open witnessed massive crowds and rampant violation of lockdown norms.Between May 18 and 22, more shops, including those in markets and those owned by private enterprises, were allowed to open, but on alternate days based on the shop numbers.Between May 4 and June 3, excise department records showed, the Delhi government had earned around Rs 200 crore through the special coronavirus fee on liquor.From June 1, around 700 liquor shops in the city out of 864 have been allowed to function all days a week. From Monday onwards, those located inside shopping malls will be allowed to function too, said a senior government official.Vinod Giri, director general, Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies, welcomed the Delhi cabinet’s decision.Giri said, “We had repeatedly pointed out that such steep increase will turn to be counter-productive as it would lead to fall in liquor sales and government revenues. We are indeed very pleased to note that the government has responded promptly to remove the cess and substitute it with tax increase, which is reasonable and within our recommendations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/liquor-to-be-cheaper-in-delhi-as-govt-removes-70-corona-fee/story-El5cAdtqJ6UypfhvYe5Z1J.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||Cases of vector-borne diseases from Jan to May lowest in five years: Data||Due to the Covid-19 lockdown, cases of dengue, malaria and leptospirosis in the city have dropped by 54% in the first five months of this year, compared to the corresponding period for the last five years, stated the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).Though there has been a worry that the lockdown can affect BMC’s disease control measures before the monsoon, data shows that in comparison with the last five years, this year till May, Mumbai has recorded the lowest number of mosquito and vector-borne diseases.Data revealed that between January and May of 2016, 1,762 water and mosquito-borne disease cases were reported but this year till May, the number fell to 809, a drop of 54%.In the first five months of 2016, as many as 114 dengue cases were recorded but this year cases decreased to 37. There has been a fall of 71% in the reporting of mosquito-borne diseases. Similarly, in the same period in 2016, Mumbai reported 1,628 malaria cases which plunged to 753 this year.The city recorded 19 cases of leptospirosis till May 2020 compared to 20 in 2016, in the first five months.Health officials said that drop in construction activities could have reduced malaria and other vector-borne diseases. “The movement of people during lockdown has been restricted by 90%, which helped to control their exposure to mosquito breeding spots. People aren’t going to parks and playing grounds. Due to restriction on construction sites, discarded items that hold water have decreased,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.As the civic body is expecting a rise in the number of mosquito-borne diseases during monsoon, they have prepared non-Covid hospitals for treatment of such patients. “Patients with dengue, malaria or leptospirosis will be sent to peripheral hospitals along with KEM (King Edward Memorial) Hospital,” added Kakani.Symptoms of coronavirus infection, malaria, dengue and fever are similar, especially fever. This often causes panic and confusion among patients and physicians.“Before getting the swab test report, we can identify the patients with other symptoms which are uncommon in dengue or malaria, like loss of taste or smell, discolouration of fingers and toes. Also, an X-Ray helps in getting a quick check into the condition of lungs,” said Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist at Hinduja Hospital.But on previous occasions, doctors have encountered patients coinfected with Covid-19 and dengue. Dr Om Srivastava, an epidemiologist, who is part of the state task force for Covid-19, said, “We have received a few cases where a Covid-19 patient also had dengue. In such cases, the health complications further increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cases-of-vector-borne-diseases-from-jan-to-may-lowest-in-five-years-data/story-x8u2BMueoRewoojGGtKdlI.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||Ganga Ram to contest govt FIR against it for violating norms||The Sir Ganga Ram Hospital on Sunday described the Delhi government’s first information report (FIR) against it as “unwarranted” and “harassment” and asserted that it would even go to court to get the complaint quashed.The Delhi government had filed an FIR against the hospital located in Rajendra Nagar for not following protocols for testing patients. The government had asked the hospital to stop testing patients on June 3, citing violations of the ICMR guidelines. The FIR was filed under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. “We will contest the FIR as it is totally unwarranted. How can an FIR be filed for not providing data in the format that government wanted? We may not have followed their format but we have been regularly updating Covid data and sending it across to the authorities concerned. So we will ensure that the FIR is quashed even if that means we have to approach the court,” said Dr D S Rana, chairman, board of management of the hospital. “Even though we are not at fault, I went and apologised for any oversight that may have occurred inadvertently and asked to stop this harassment. There was shortage of data entry operators during lockdown so there was difficulty in feeding data in a particular format. There is no criminal offence committed from our side.”A Delhi government spokesperson refused comment on the hospital contemplating to move the court. The copy of the FIR against the hospital read: “The order of Health and Family Welfare Department regarding guidelines for tracking and monitoring of every Covid-19 suspected cases tested in various accredited labs across Delhi wherein it was mandatory for the labs to collect sample only through the Delhi government’s RT-PCR App. Further CDMO (Chief District Medical Officer) cum mission director, Central, mentioned that Sir Ganga Ram hospital is still not using RT-PCR app even till today (03/06) which is a clear violation of direction issued under Epidemic Disease Covid-19 regulation 2020.” Rana said the management is also working on implementing the state government’s June 3 directive to turn the hospital into a dedicated Covid-19 facility. “We are working towards it and have so far managed to convert about 40% of the main hospital into a Covid hospital,” said Rana.The 675-bed hospital is increasing its ventilator bed count to 60 to treat critical patients. However, the primary concern of the hospital is to find space for its sick non-Covid patients. “Creating a dedicated Covid-19 facility is not easy as you have to assign staff, change ventilation, among other things. No hospital can turn do this overnight; much less a busy hospital like ours. It requires time as there are about 200 seriously ill patients, mostly cardiac, neuro surgery and nephrology patients who are not fit to be discharged yet. Where will I send them? We do not refuse to help in the pandemic, but at the same time we can’t let non-covid patients die,” said Rana.The hospital has already allotted two of its subsidiary hospitals- the 140-bed City Hospital and the 40-bed Kolmet Hospital- for treating only Covid-19 patients. “Apart from that 20% of our bed capacity in the main hospital was also assigned for treating Covid-19 patients, so what more did they want?,” said Rana.The government on June 3 had also ordered the hospital to stop testing for the coronavirus for violating Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) guidelines. The hospital said it had to refer about 200 people to other centres from its fever clinic since.Seema Singh, 46, who was in the hospital for dialysis, was running a fever. She was asked her to tested for the virus. “I asked them to test my sample but they said they could not as the hospital had been barred from doing so for the time being. I come all the way from Ghaziabad and am not sure if I will find a facility to test for Covid there. It’s too much inconvenience for patients,” she says.The hospital is only testing those samples already under process. “It will only impact overall testing process as other labs will be overburdened and will send results late, more so for government testing labs that anyway are dealing with a huge sample load of their own. Ultimately, patients will suffer and we are helpless,” says Dr Rana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/ganga-ram-to-contest-govt-fir-against-it-for-violating-norms/story-oRuES5faCHOTsHhNvW2MNP.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||Containment curbs eased in Delhi’s Nizamuddin Basti after 70 days||After almost 70 days, residents of Nizamuddin Basti could step out their locality, as the Delhi government on Sunday scaled down the containment measures.The Basti was declared a containment zone on March 30, days after close to 2,000 people were evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters.According to Delhi government officials, the area continued to be a containment zone for this long as a middle-aged woman tested positive on May 5.As per Delhi government officials, no case has been reported in the last 28 days and they decided to de-seal the area.Mohd Yamin, secretary of the Hazarat Nizamuddin Council, said, “We are thankful to the government for listening to us and de-sealing the area. With mosques being allowed to open from Monday, we are happy that now we can go and offer prayers.”DEFENCE COLONY But just a few kilometres away, a lane comprising 11 houses in Defence Colony was declared a containment zone on Sunday. Many residents in the area questioned the decision to declare such a small area a containment zone. According to a senior Delhi police official aware of the development, “There are 7-8 cases reported from the lane. There are two houses where there is more number of cases.”The area was declared a containment zone after Covid-19 cases were reported from households in C block. As per the order passed by Harleen Kaur, district magistrate of South East Delhi, public movement in the lane has been restricted.Col (retd) Ranjit Singh, the president of the Defence Colony RWA, said, “There are about 14 people in these three homes, of which two are in hospital and rest are quarantined at home. Several sanitisation measures are being taken in the area.”Kum Kum Malhotra, a resident of C-block, said she is in home-quarantine after her sister tested positive on May 29. Her sister was admitted to a hospital in Gurugram on May 30. “I don’t know why this area has been declared a containment zone. We have been in home quarantine ever since my sister tested positive. She has almost recovered and will be home soon. I hope they scale down the measures soon,” Malhotra said.Malhotra said her sister must have got the infection from their driver, who is in home quarantine after he tested positive. “There are seven members in our family. While my sister tested positive, the rest have all tested negative for Covid-19,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/containment-curbs-eased-in-nizamuddin-basti-after-70-days/story-orZDsgM2kH8LGY2pu9iERI.html
08-06-2020||Delhi||North East Delhi riots: Charge sheet filed in murder of 85-year-old woman||The Delhi Police on Sunday filed a charge sheet in the rioting and murder case of 85-year-old Akbari Begum, the only woman among the 53 people killed during the communal riots in north-east Delhi in February. Six men, including two brothers, have been charged for allegedly killing Begum by setting her four-storey house at Garmi Road in Bhajanpura on fire on February 25, crime branch officials associated with the probe said.The 606-page charge sheet was filed before a duty magistrate in a Delhi court in the afternoon. The court has fixed the next date of hearing on June 21. All the men are presently in jail.Officials said that on February 25, a “riotous mob” barged into Begum’s house, on the ground and first floors of which her family members ran a garment workshop. The mob set the flammable items in the workshop on fire. The blaze soon reached the two upper floors where Begum and her family members were.“While her family members climbed onto the rooftop and locked themselves, Begum could not escape due to her old age and subsequently died of suffocation (asphyxia due to inhalation of smoke). Her body was found on a folding bed on the second floor,” deputy commissioner of police (crime) Rajesh Deo said.The firemen and the local police personnel safely rescued 13 people—Begum’s family members and others present in the building. The mob had also ransacked the building. A case was registered at the Bhajanpura police station on the complaint of Begum’s son. The case was later transferred to the special investigation team (SIT) of the crime branch.During the probe, an investigator, requesting anonymity, said they had learned that many people had captured videos and images of the violence at Begum’s house on their cellphones. The videos soon went viral on social media. The videos were procured and taken on record. The cellphones on which the videos were recorded were seized and the statements of 53 witnesses were recorded, the officer said.“We found CCTV camera footage in which the mob that entered Begum’s house and set it on fire was seen. Six men, mostly living in Begum’s neighbourhood, were arrested on the basis of videos, statements of witnesses and technical evidence,” the officer said.The arrested men were identified as Arun Kumar,26, his brother, Varun Kumar,22, Vishal Singh,29, Ravi Kumar,24, Prakash Chand,36, and Suraj Singh,28. They have been charged for rioting, murder, attempt to murder, dacoity with murder, arson, house trespass, and destruction of evidence under various sections of the Indian Penal Code.Crime branch officers said that 752 cases were registered in connection with the north-east Delhi riots that claimed the lives of 53 people and left over 400 injured. Until Sunday, the police had filed charge sheets in 81 cases, in which more than 520 people were charged with various offences, including rioting, arson, murder and attempt to murder.The police have also prepared their charge sheet in the murder case of head constable Rattan Lal, whose death was the first reported casualty when incidents of stone-pelting in north-east Delhi on February 23 turned into a full-blown riot the next morning. He had received a bullet wound, apart from multiple injuries to the head and body during one of many incidents of stone-pelting that took place that day. A deputy commissioner of police (DCP) was also critically injured at the same spot where Lal’s body was found. The charge sheet may be filed on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/north-east-delhi-riots-charge-sheet-filed-in-murder-of-85-year-old-woman/story-y8XvmJHOEmBaDzZ1YmKrxK.html

The man who assaulted and threatened him with a gun has a criminal history and is said to be an associate of another criminal, who is lodged in a Gurugram jail in connection with a 2018 murder case. Investigators are looking for the attacker and his associate who recorded the incident on his cellphone, the police said.The police added that they have come across a few facts, one of which may be the reason for the assault and intimidation.“There could be several reasons for which he was assaulted—he had made a TikTok video in which he posed as a woman; he had stopped his friend from uploading a particular photograph as his social media profile picture (the friend is posing with the jailed criminal in the photograph); he is friends with a girl,” a police officer, requesting anonymity, said.In the 45-second video, a man, wearing a pair of shorts and covering his face with a white towel, is seen holding the boy by the collar and threatening him in Haryanvi. He refers to a TikTok video while pointing the gun at him. Another man, who has been identified as the boy’s cousin, arrives and asks the man what the issue is.The boy is seen apologising after the man asks him to do so. “Sorry bol dobara (Apologise again)”, the man says in the video as he slaps the boy a couple of times and asks him to leave.The person who uploaded the video on social media also sought police action, saying that the teenager did not file police complaint out of fear.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Anto Alphonse said that a case of threatening, common intention and use of firearms has been registered under sections 506 and 34 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 25 of the Arms Act.“We are looking for the two suspects. They will be caught soon,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tiktok-artist-assaulted-in-viral-video/story-SkJy0KPfFwsVtl4dgN8kKI.html

08-06-2020||Delhi||8,000 north MCD teachers on Covid-19 duty not paid salary for three months||Nearly 8,000 teachers in the 714 North Delhi Municipal Corporation-run schools, who are currently deployed at the government’s food distribution centres amid the Covid-19 pandemic, have not been paid salaries for the last three months. While many said that they are not being able to repay their loans and school fees of their children, some are struggling to even provide the basic necessities to their dependents. Niket Giri, a teacher at a municipal school in Mangolpuri, said that he has two loans to repay and five dependents to look after in the family. “I am working during a pandemic without thinking twice about the safety of my family. This is when I am not being paid (salary) for the three months. It’s become so difficult to survive now. I had to pay instalments of Rs 30,000 per month to the bank. For the last three months I have been borrowing money from friends’ and relatives to repay the loan,” he said.The teachers had last received the salary of the month of February in April. Another teacher working at the civic body school in Sultanpuri said he had used up all his savings on his wedding in February. “Within a few days after the wedding, the lockdown was announced and the schools were shut. I literally had nothing left. After waiting for two months, we received the salary for the month of February in April. It also came after the tax deduction. We have not received even a penny after that. I can show anyone that my bank account is zero since the last month. I get panic attacks when I think about how I will repay all the loans I have taken from my relatives and friends,” he said, requesting anonymity.A 35-year-old teacher working at a school in Budh Vihar said he is unable to even purchase groceries and shops are refusing to give items on credit. “We are distributing ration and cooked food among those in need but who will take care of our families?” he said.The MCD teachers association has warned the government of going on indefinite strike against the non-payment of salaries immediately after the lockdown is lifted. In the last three months, the association has written multiple letters to Delhi education minister Manish Sisodia, north MCD officials, members of the opposition party in the Capital and even to the Prime Minister Office seeking intervention. “While the teachers of east and south MCD schools have received their salaries, those working in north MCD schools are not being paid since March. We can’t go on strike amid the lockdown since it’s prohibited under the Delhi Disaster Management Act. We have also started sending out messages to the parents of our students seeking support,” said Ramnivas Solanki, president of the association.When contacted, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds education and finance portfolios, said, “We have given all dues till May. MCD should tell where they have used the money.”Authorities at North corporation said that they have not received funds from the Delhi government to pay the salaries. Avtar Singh, mayor of the North Delhi Municipal Corporation, said that the municipality has been trying to explore all the options to generate revenue to pay the salaries of their employees. “We understand the issues teachers and their families must be facing. We have been requesting the Delhi government to release all our pending funds. They should, in fact, give us extra funds keeping in mind how these teachers are risking their lives and working amid the pandemic,” he said. Solanki said that the government and the MCD should not let the teachers suffer. “The Delhi government always says it’s paid the money but the MCD maintains that they have not received sufficient funds. They should not let 8,000 families suffer because of their politics,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/8-000-north-mcd-teachers-on-covid-19-duty-not-paid-salary-for-three-months/story-G4g9zwnnl8HPhPwqHef7bO.html
08-06-2020||Mumbai||CRZ 2019 looks at coast as an industry, mulls real estate, port development: Experts||Coastal communities along the Indian coastline have raised concerns about the safety of their livelihood as natural disasters are becoming frequent.Ahead of World Oceans Day on Monday, Goa-based coastal marine policy researcher Sarita Fernandes compiled a report on how all coastal states and union territories along the country’s 7,600 km coastline have objected to the coastal regulation zone (CRZ), 2019, norms through legal mediums, protests, and research publications over the past year.“Rather than having a strong coastal policy to protect ecosystems and stakeholders, the CRZ 2019 looks at the coast as an industry with promising real estate and port development as key stakeholders,” said Fernandes. “Rough estimates say at the CRZ 1991 was amended 25 times and 2011 rules were amended 15 times which clearly shows that the instruments which are easily mouldable cannot instil confidence for sound coastal and ocean management.”The report highlights how the fishing community and citizens in Maharashtra have moved the Bombay high court and Supreme Court (SC) against proposed projects that received CRZ clearance such as Coastal Road, bullet train and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj’s statue in Arabian Sea that propose to reclaim mangroves, wetlands, fishing beds and marine wildlife habitats like reef building corals, that are all protected under CRZ 2019 itself.Mumbai-based activist BN Kumar said, “Maharashtra cannot think about a blue economy scheme without maintaining blue waters properly.”Goa has challenged the entire policy itself seeking protection to ecologically sensitive areas such as Khazan lands and turtle nesting sites. “India’s coasts have for long been vulnerable to climate change impacts and localised disasters,” said Kanchi Kolhi, an environmental governance expert with Delhi-based Centre for Policy Research.“The recent cyclones are the newest reminders of this. However, the CRZ 2019 has been designed to claim most vulnerable coastal spaces for highways, industry, airports, real estate and even sewage treatment plants. It has assumed that these are empty lands, either devoid of environmental risks or where vulnerability can be circumvented with technology,” said Kohli.Karnataka and Tamil Nadu have objected CRZ clearances issued for major ports affecting lakhs of traditional fishers, the report said adding that citizens groups from Vishakapatnam have petitioned the government on the omission of the hazard line in the new CRZ 2019. “India’s coastal and ocean management really needs a rehaul,” said Sanjay Upadhyay, Supreme Court lawyer. “As far as regulatory instruments are concerned a notification issued as early as 1991 in the form of CRZ 1991 later amended in 2011 and now in 2019 clearly suggests that a loose instrument cannot be appropriate for sound coastal and ocean management,” Upadhyay said.Odisha and West Bengal, which recently witnessed cyclone damage, have raised an alarm about the reduction of the high tide line and NDZ risking the safety of more citizens along major beaches, that also happen to be the country’s largest turtle nesting grounds (Odisha). “Between 1991 and 2019, the only positive thing to happen was the introduction of CRZ IV (area covered between Low Tide Line and 12 nautical miles seaward). Apart from that there have only been relaxations to allow commercial exploitation of the coast,” said environmentalist Debi Goenka.A senior environment ministry official said, “CRZ 2019 was nothing more than enhancing previous coastal protection norms and combining sustainable development through tourism and livelihood opportunities, which is helping us achieve a balance and the concept of blue revolution.” Sanjai Jalla, from the Society of Integrated Coastal Management (SICOM) under the Union environment ministry said, “The overall supervision and monitoring from the high tide line onwards has become very active over the past six to seven years. There is a dedicated team working on this, which is developing state project management units. Their primary job is to protect the coastal regions and not to allow uncontrolled activities and illegal developments. This is getting further enhanced under CRZ 2019.”What the CRZ 2019 rules say?The norms, based on recommendations of Dr Shailesh Nayak-led committee, relaxed previous CRZ norms (1991 and 2011), to allow development closer to the coast. It increased floor-space-index for coastal cities, up to 15% FSI for no development zones (NDZ). It reduced the width of the creek from the high tide line to 50 metres from the earlier limit of 100 metres. It limited CRZ to the first 500m of land from high tide line (extent till which coastal waters can reach the farthest on land) and not till the hazard line (natural changes along the shore due possible impacts of climate change). Eco-tourism activities were allowed in ecologically fragile areas, mining activities could be regulated, redevelopment of fishing villages, and identifying open spaces and parks as NDZ among many other decisions.Coral bleaching along major coastal zones in India during May: BNHSMumbai: Pre-monsoon bleaching of coral reefs (schedule-I species) under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972, took place during the month of May across the Gulf of Mannar, Gulf of Kutch, and Lakshadweep, said Bombay Natural History Society (BNHS). “Significant bleaching was expected as sea surface temperatures ranged between 30-32 degrees Celsius. We have images from all these areas with 50% tridacna (giant saltwater clams), which was indicative of high bleaching,” said Deepak Apte, director, BNHS. Corals can survive narrow range distributions with temperatures ranging from 18-24 degrees Celsius. “Beyond 29 degrees Celsius continuous incidents of bleaching will take place,” said Apte adding that the next assessment of the marine ecosystems will be taken during the post-monsoon period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/crz-2019-looks-at-coast-as-an-industry-mulls-real-estate-port-development-experts/story-glsDDM3VvMK6hz388303fO.html

The Sena leader also questioned how Sood managed to arrange for buses and flights when many state governments were found to be helpless during the lockdownOn the issue of migrants, Deshmukh said that so far 12 lakh migrant workers have been sent to their respective states through the special “shramik” trains and claimed that the entire cost of the journey was borne by the state government.Deshmukh was in Pune to review the Covid-19 situation in the city.“Till now, around 12 lakh migrant workers have been sent to their respective states in special trains. Around 5.5 lakh migrant workers were transported to their respective borders in state transport buses. The railway ministry announced that they would be bearing 85 per cent of the ticket fare of migrant workers’ homebound journey but not a single penny has been received from them,” he said.He said that the entire cost around Rs 100 crore was spent from the CM relief fund for sending the migrants to their states.“We made all the arrangements of the migrant labourers including giving them food and all these people upon reaching to their states are appreciating the state government,” he said.Replying to a question on the leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis criticising the state government, Deshmukh said that all people from all walks of life, NGOs, all political parties are coming forward and helping in the fight against Covid-19 and in this time, in such situation, a leader like Fadnavis engaging in politics is not good.“Fadnavis should stop dreaming,” said Deshmukh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/home-minister-deshmukh-counters-ally-sena-on-sonu-sood/story-jpssrgVVwePo3ZjbxUhz4J.html

The number of active cases in the ward is now lower than the Dhole Patil road (509), Yerawada-Kalas-Dhanori (289), Bibwewadi (213) and Sinhgad road (204) wards.The Bhavani peth ward has also a reported 3,078 co-morbid patients and 378 pregnant women, both categories of whom are vulnerable to the infection and are being kept a close watch on.The ward administration which keeps a check on the ground took basic measures and ensured strict implementation which has resulted in the ward slowing down the rate of infection. Assistant municipal commissioner Bankar Somnath Haribhau said, “We have ensured maximum contact tracing as per the ICMR guidelines. We have also sealed the entire building of the slum lane when we found positive cases and also took swabs of all the residents, symptomatic and asymptomatic, which ensured that we could contain the spread of the virus. The restricted movement of PMC staff, most of who lived in this area was providing essential services, helped.”According to Haribhau, the PMC appointed dedicated officers to each of the micro-containment zones and also a police officer to ensure that social distancing and safety measures are followed, including wearing masks at all times when one steps out of the house.“Even today we have our officers to ensure that social distancing is followed at all shops which have opened again,” he said.A PMC health official working on the ground in Bhavani peth, requesting anonymity, said, “When Bhavani peth was at its peak, we were reporting about 30 cases per day which have now come down to five to seven positive cases daily. We could achieve all this because of the house-to-house survey to look for anyone who showed any possible symptoms of virus. We also cleaned the public toilets at least three times a day with sodium hypochlorite and started early contact tracing, which meant whenever we got the list of positives in our ward we started contacting at least six close contacts and collected their swabs within two-three hours, which were sent for tracing. Till the time the results were out they were either quarantined at home or in an institution, depending on if there were an attached toilet and a separate room in the house.”The official further added that while there was resistance initially from the locals as the awareness grew, they become supportive and came forward if they found any symptoms similar to flu.He further added, “We also started distributing homeopathic medicines which we delivered to each house. We also distributed masks to everyone. We conducted door-to-door surveys looking for vulnerable senior citizens who had any reported comorbidity and asked the home members to keep a close watch on them and report to the PMC in case of any symptoms of flu.”The ward has one swab collection centre at the Savitribai Phule municipal school and also has a mobile swab collection centre, run on a bus.The civic body has also supplied ration kits in the ward to restrict the movement of people within the ward.As of June 4, about 16,131rations kits have been distributed in the ward, of which 15,731 have been distributed by the PMC and remaining by NGOs.The ration kits provided to the citizens include essential items like sugar, flour, sweet oil, pulses, rice, flattened rice, salt, soap, chili powder, tea powder, and milk powder.Similar measures were taken at the Patil Estate slum which was the most affected in the Shivajinagar-Ghole road ward.
