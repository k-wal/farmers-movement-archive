16-06-2020||City||60-year-old dies after being denied admission by Ghaziabad hospitals||A 60-year-old man, who had recently retired as a senior technician from the Indian Railways, died on Tuesday after allegedly being denied treatment by three private hospitals and one government hospital in Ghaziabad. The family of the deceased, who was a resident of Vijay Nagar, Ghaziabad, has, however, filed a complaint with the district magistrate (DM) against two private hospitals only.The deceased, Umesh Kumar Sharma, who had retired on May 31, had complained of severe breathlessness on June 14, his family said, adding that he was first taken to a local nursing home where the doctors advised the family to get him admitted at a hospital.“On June 14, we took him to Yashoda Hospital in Kaushambi where he was kept in the emergency ward, but later the hospital denied him admission and said that the patient had symptoms of coronavirus (Covid-19). We requested them to keep the patient overnight, but they refused to give treatment and asked us to go to a Railway Hospital. We then brought him home. The next day, we again went to a government acquired Covid hospital in Nandgram and a private hospital in Kavi Nagar and he was denied admission at both places,” said Jitesh Sharma, nephew of the deceased.He said that on June 15 morning they took him to Columbia Asia hospital in Kavi Nagar. “There he was kept in the emergency ward for some time, but they also denied him admission. Then we rushed him to the MMG Hospital, but he collapsed there,” Jitesh said. Despite being denied treatment at four places, the family has so far submitted a complaint against Yashoda Hospital and Columbia Asia Hospitals to the DM. “The two hospitals, Yashoda and Columbia Asia, could have admitted my uncle and treated him. We have submitted a written complaint at the DM’s office, and demand that an explanation should be sought from the two hospitals. We don’t want that such incidents should be repeated with anyone else,” the nephew said.Officials of Yashoda Hospital, Kaushambi denied laxity on their part.“The family’s allegation that the deceased was not given proper treatment is incorrect. The patient was given treatment in the emergency ward and was stabilized. He had typical Covid-19 symptoms. Since our isolation ward was full, we could not admit him there. The record of the occupancy of the isolation ward has also been submitted to the office of chief medical officer (CMO). We referred him to Northern Railway hospital in Delhi and it was the family’s decision to not take him there,” said Dr Sunil Dagar, spokesperson, Yashoda hospital.The Columbia Asia hospital authorities said they did not find any records of the patient at their hospital. “We have gone through our records and to the best of our knowledge, no patient named Umesh Sharma was registered on June 14 or June 15 at Columbia Asia Hospital, Ghaziabad,” said a hospital spokesperson.Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, said the complaint given by the family to the DM will be routed to his office.“Once we get a copy of the complaint we will initiate a detailed inquiry in the matter and explanations will be sought from all hospitals. Thereafter, a due course of action will be decided. If laxity on the part of a government acquired hospital surfaces, then action will be taken against it as well,” he added.Earlier in June, a 30-year-old pregnant woman from Khoda in Ghaziabad after she was allegedly denied treatment by at least eight government and private hospitals in Noida and Ghaziabad due to non-availability of beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/60-year-old-dies-after-being-denied-admission-by-ghaziabad-hospitals/story-fKDNLj9QUb0ycu3fiFUTnJ.html

The department in May managed to generate only 16% revenue in stamp duty and property registration compared to that of March, officials said on Tuesday.After a gap of over a month, the property registration restarted in the district on May 4. According to the officials, those who want to get the registry of property done are given a fixed time slots based on the appointment acquired through telephone.During the 26 days of May, the total revenue generated was Rs 20 crore, against about Rs 125 crore in 24 days of March, the officials said, adding that the department, on average, earns a revenue of Rs 150 crore per month in normal days. The collection for the month of February was also around Rs 125 crore, the officials said.Notably, the registration of property is a major source of income for the state government. The officials said that while commercial property registrations were negligible, only 2,500 registrations could be done from May 4 to June 15. This is a meagre number considering that the department usually does about 15,000 registrations in a month, they said. “Total revenue generated till date (from May 4 to June 15) is Rs 30 crore, which is very less considering the amount generated in a month’s time before the lockdown. Of the total revenue generated during the said period, most have come from the rural areas. The registration of apartments and commercial property is almost nil,” said SK Tripathi, assistant inspector general (registration), Gautam Budh Nagar.“The main reason is the Covid-19 pandemic. People are very cautious, and are not making any investment. Only those in need are selling or buying property,” he added.Tripathi said that most of the registrations were of agriculture properties from areas like Dadri and Jewar.There are six registration offices in the district, of which three are in Noida, and one each in Greater Noida, Dadri and Jewar.“In normal days, the number of total registrations is at least 500 per day in the district, which has now shrunk to 100 to 120 a day. The property business is really poor due to the ongoing pandemic,” said Pradeep Asthana, senior registrar, GB Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-stamp-and-registration-department-generates-just-16-revenue-in-may/story-VVDJDDyjSd4HlWlAoKqTDM.html

The budget has been earmarked for 267 different works, including the development and maintenance of green spaces, including parks, green belts along roads and plantations at suitable sites, officials said.“The move will help to make Noida green, clean and beautiful. The Rs 88.10 crore will be spent on new developmental work, maintenance of existing green areas and plantation of trees. We will carry out developmental work and maintenance of green areas in both villages and sectors so that we can make the city a better place to live in,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer of the Noida authority.Noida is spread across 20,000 hectares on the agricultural land of 81 villages.The authority had in April decided to complete all tender and selection-related formalities in May so that work can begin on ground in June. The authority wants to start with horticulture because plantation of saplings and developmental work in parks in the coming rainy season will prove to be more productive, officials said. The authority said that the money will help vendors and contractors engage daily wage workers, who were left jobless due to the nationwide lockdown imposed on March 24 to prevent the spread of Covid 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-to-spend-rs-88-10-crore-on-horticulture-activities/story-TWSwpijL0YhQa32k31apmN.html

16-06-2020||Noida||GB Nagar health officials asked to chalk out plan to control Covid-19 surge||The nodal officer appointed by the state government to take stock of the Covid-19 containment measures in Gautam Budh Nagar district on Tuesday asked the district officials to focus on bringing down the rate at which the infections are rising since June 1.According to the district’s health department data, out of the 1,038 cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) reported till June 15, as many as 615 cases were reported since June 1 alone. As the cases surge, the district also has the highest number of cases compared to other districts in the state. A total of 14,598 Covid-19 cases have been reported in Uttar Pradesh so far.Appointed by chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday, Dr Jiledar Rawat, a neonatal surgeon at King George’s Medical University (KGMU), Lucknow, has been assigned to accelerate and monitor efforts by the health department in breaking the chain of infection and combatting the coronavirus spread in Gautam Budh Nagar.During a meeting with district health officials on Tuesday, Dr Rawat directed them to identify the major factors contributing to the recent spike in the number of infections. “He has also asked us to analyse the surge in positive cases and identify the areas, where infections are increasing at higher rates. He also discussed the control measures taken in the containment zones. Dr Rawat will soon submit his report to the superior officers in the matter,” Dr Deepak Ohri, chief medical officer (CMO), Gautam Budh Nagar.  The district has as many as 163 category 1 containment zones and 123 category 2 containment zones. Of these, 30 areas were declared containment zones in June. Areas in containment zone category 1 have one positive case and a perimeter of over 400 metres, while category 2 containment zones have more than one positive case and a 1km perimeter.The CMO added that Dr Rawat has asked all the health officials to focus on systematic surveillance system and speed up the setting up of required infrastructure to tackle the rising numbers. “He also took stock of the surveillance system and management of different Covid-dedicated government and private hospitals in the district. We also gave him a comprehensive report on Covid-19 cases in the district,” said Dr Ohri.Apart from Gautam Budh Nagar, the chief minister has appointed nodal officers to monitor Covid-19 cases in as many as 10 other districts in the state, including Ghaziabad, Agra, Meerut, Kanpur City, Aligarh, Moradabad, Firozabad, Bulandshahr, Jhansi and Basti.Meanwhile, the CMO also said all the suspected Covid-19 patients in the GB Nagar will be tested in laboratories in the district itself even if they are not permanent residents here. “As per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) protocol, even the persons belonging to other districts and states will not be prohibited from being tested for Covid-19 here,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-health-officials-asked-to-chalk-out-plan-to-control-covid-19-surge/story-hPZnjZn2JrMw8sRDiukxeN.html

The officials of the district health department said none of the minors who contracted the virus needed to be shifted to L2 or L3 category hospitals, where only serious or critical cases are treated.According to officials, 22 minors have tested positive for Covid-19 so far in the district, and a majority of them have recovered while the rest are undergoing treatment at the L1 Covid hospital in Sahibabad. The youngest of them was a newborn while the oldest are about 17 years of age.“The recovery rate of minor children is very high, maybe because they have higher immunity levels. Most of them responded well to treatment at L1 hospitals. In contrast, the aged -- in the age group of 40 years to over 60 years -- make up most of the fatalities. These included people with pre-existing health conditions that got aggravated due to Covid-19,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said.“As far as minors are concerned, we have no instance of a minor going into a critical state so far. Most of these children acquired the infection from their immediate family members or relatives,” Dr Gupta said.According to the officials of the L1 Covid hospital at Sahibabad, only four minors are currently undergoing treatment at the hospital.“The four children are recovering fast and responding well to treatment. Their recovery rate is high and this is very encouraging,” Dr Pramod Kumar, medical superintendent of the Sahibabad hospital, said.“My wife along with my newborn twin daughters was admitted to a L2 hospital in Sanjay Nagar, after my wife tested . positive for Covid-19. The newborns stayed with the mother. After a couple of days, I brought home one of the twins while the other remained with her mother at the hospital. They got discharged on May 3. Both of my daughters are safe and did not contract the infection,” 30-year-old resident of Siddharth Vihar, not wishing to be named, said.The tally of Covid-19 positive patients stood at 638 as on June 15.According to official estimates, the age group of 0-20 years is the least affected in the district with only 9% of total the cases falling into this category. The age group of 21-40 years accounts for 49% of all cases. The age group of 41-60 years accounts for 31% of cases, while those over 60 years of age chalk up the remaining 11% cases.Meanwhile, Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has directed that Covid beds in the districts under the Meerut division of western Uttar Pradesh be doubled.“The NCR areas are highly sensitive in terms of higher number of Covid-19 cases and Adityanath has directed that the beds capacity of all hospitals be doubled to deal with a further escalation in cases. The district magistrates and police have been asked to take all steps to contain the infection,” Awanish Awasthi, additional chief secretary (home), Uttar Pradesh, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/recovery-rate-of-minors-is-very-high-says-ghaziabad-health-dept/story-tZ3VJWmsqzMv9ZSOTvgUwI.html
16-06-2020||City||Relief for 10 lakh residents as sector curbs lifted from Vaishali, Khoda and Loni||Ghaziabad: The Ghaziabad district administration on Tuesday decided to do away with its sector scheme implemented in areas of Vaishali, Khoda and Loni. District officials said that the scheme will now be applicable only to the containment zones in these areas.The move comes as a big relief to about 10 lakh people living in these areas as their movements had been restricted due to the sector scheme which was implemented in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases. “Earlier the sector scheme was implemented for entire Vaishali, but now it will be applicable only in containment zones. We have done this as part of guidelines issued by the Centre and the state government, and will be applicable for Khoda and Loni too,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.On June 12, the Supreme Court, hearing a petition on sector scheme, had directed that the Ghaziabad district magistrate should ensure that central guidelines are followed. Mohammad Fuzail Khan, the petitioner and a Vaishali resident, had moved the apex court with two contentions – removal of sealing of his high-rise, Gateway Tower, and scrapping of the sector scheme. Khoda, Loni and Vaishali had been placed under the sector scheme since May 10, May 27 and June 1, respectively, and entire periphery of the localities were barricaded with restriction on the movement of residents.“The localities of Vaishali and Kaushambi have about 10-12 containment zones. The sector scheme will now be applicable only for specific areas in Vaishali,” said Aditya Prajapati, sub divisional magistrate and incident commander for Vaishali.“Now, the barricaded entry/exit points will also be opened up while the local police will take a call with respect to traffic and crime situation,” he added.Ajay Kumar Singh, SHO of Kaushambi police station, said that out of six routes in Vaishali, three have been opened up. A part of Vaishali comes under the Kaushambi police jurisdiction.“A call will be taken up for other routes in coming days. The three routes opened so far include the route near Max Hospital which leads to UP Gate (Delhi-Ghaziabad border). This will benefit Vaishali residents who wish to go to Delhi,” the SHO said.Meanwhile, officials of Khoda Nagar Palika said that they have also opened up 10 routes. After Khoda was sealed on May 10, the officials had barricaded 50 out of 52 entry/exit points.“The routes which have been opened up include five towards Noida, four towards NH-9 and one towards Delhi. More routes will be opened up once we receive further directions,” said KK Bhadana, executive officer, Khoda Nagar Palika.On June 11, a day before the hearing at the Supreme Court, the district officials had announced relaxations and directed opening of markets in Khoda and Vaishali. The markets in Vaishali and 15 markets in Khoda were directed to be opened as per previous directions for opening on alternate days.“Through our petition, we have been trying to say that restriction should be in place in containment zones and not in other areas. If the administration has finally taken a decision, it will bring relief to many residents in the three localities,” said Khan, the petitioner. Meanwhile, Manoj Goel, councillor from Vaishali Setcor 1 and Kaushambi, said that he had met the Ghaziabad district magistrate on Monday and held discussions about the sector scheme. “The DM had directed for relaxations in the sector scheme and asked the sub divisional magistrate to open up Vaishali locality. The routes are also opening up and we expect that more relaxations will be given soon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/relief-for-10-lakh-residents-as-sector-curbs-lifted-from-vaishali-khoda-and-loni/story-x6KfE3HnrUcSUdO72nt25H.html
16-06-2020||Gurugram||MCG to formulate water bills based on property tax records||Using property tax records as a reference, the water supply division of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is working towards formulating water bills for nearly 3.3 lakh residents across the city. While the water supply division only has records of 67,000 water connections in the city, the MCG’s tax branch has a record of 3.97 lakh buildings on which it levies property tax annually.Amit Sandilya, an executive engineer in the water supply division, said that the department is now using details mentioned in property tax records such as the size of the building, exact address, and the name of the taxpayer to generate water connection bills and issue them to 3.3 lakh residents, for the first time, starting next month. “We have procured details from the tax branch and have started working towards generating fresh water connection bills for the first time for more than 3 lakh residents in the city. This will not only help increase the cash reserves of the MCG but also help us keep a check on illegal water connections,” Sandilya said.Since January 2018, the MCG has started taking over the responsibility of providing water connections within residential sectors from the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP). During the same time, MCG also took over 37 HSVP sectors.In May last year, MCG, HSVP, and the Haryana government had a meeting regarding the situation of water connections in the city. Even though the MCG was providing connections to about 67,000 registered residents, water bills were being paid to HSVP. The Haryana government subsequently directed HSVP to transfer all data and relevant details of the registered water connections to MCG.As per MCG officials, water is charged at a flat rate in the city—the first 20 kilolitres are charged at ₹8 per kilolitre and for every kilolitre thereafter the charges are ₹10 per kilolitre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/mcg-to-formulate-water-bills-based-on-property-tax-records/story-nUkeqkS3kzppakTog8nUtL.html
16-06-2020||Gurugram||Lack of public transport options hassles office-goers||A lack of public transport options and lockdown restrictions amid a spike in the cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has made it increasingly difficult for people—mostly office-goers from the city’s neighbouring districts—to commute to work. At key junctions on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway, such as Iffco Chowk and Shankar Chowk, where private shared cabs and buses used to swarm before the lockdown, only a few shared cabs now operate. Commuters say that the limited number of passengers they carry to adhere to norms of social distancing further adds to the hassle.At Iffco chowk on Monday evening, Sanjeev Kumar, 45, a private company worker, approached at least five cabs for a drop to Mahipalpur in Delhi, eventually opting to wait. “Since fewer cabs are available, the route varies. Earlier, one could get a cab to Delhi from here in five minutes. I have been waiting for an hour. The cabs are also fleecing customers, charging anything between ₹100 to ₹150 for a drop to Mahipalpur against the earlier fare of ₹30 to ₹40. I cannot afford to take an Ola or an Uber every day and other options like buses and the Metro are restricted,” Kumar said.Kumar was among a dozen commuters at the junction, who haggled with drivers of several private cabs, and on occasion, asked for a lift from private vehicles.“I have been travelling from Mayapuri in Delhi to Manesar daily for the past seven years for work. I rely on shared cabs along the highway as they are cheap and convenient. Since I joined work last week, the waiting time at the junction has increased. Also, we are apprehensive about sitting in a crowded cab due to the fear of the infection. But the cab drivers also want to fill all the seats. So, it is a problem,” Nishant Yadav, who works as a supervisor in a factory in Manesar, said. Shankar Chowk, another major junction which serves as a transit point for people to commute to the city from Delhi, Faridabad, Nuh, Palwal, Sohna, also witnessed a similar wait for cabs on Tuesday morning. A crowd of about 30 people stood in close quarters, with little social distancing, waiting for a ride to their respective workplaces. “It is relatively easier to get a commute in the morning but one has to pay more and wait for a few minutes since cabs are limited. Due to fewer options, people leave for work earlier in the evening. After 7pm, there are hardly any cabs. Autorickshaws are not ideal for long distances across borders,” Brajesh Mishra, an accountant from Sohna, said.HT had earlier reported that as the government eased the lockdown restrictions, criminals started targeting commuters along these junctions by robbing them after offering shared cab rides. At least three incidents of snatching were reported last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/lack-of-public-transport-options-hassles-office-goers/story-j8fFgic25ZlCWnvikITrUL.html
16-06-2020||Gurugram||City RWAs gear up to fight Covid-19; build isolation centres||With the number of Covid-19 cases breaching the 3,000-mark last week, several residents’ welfare association (RWAs) across the city have started establishing isolation centres of their own. Gurugram alone accounts for 41% of the Covid-19 burden of the state. Over 7,722 cases have been reported in the state so far, out of which Gurugram accounts for 3,477 cases. Of these 3,477 cases, at least 1,664 are still active in nature. As per an estimate made by Vivek Kalia, nodal officer, hospital and ventilator management, if the number of cases increases to almost a lakh in August, then the city would require at least 37,000 beds and more than 2,000 ventilators.  In an official release by the administration on Tuesday, deputy commissioner Amit Khatri sought the cooperation for increasing the number of isolation centres in the city. “RWAs and gram panchayats are being approached to make a list of suitable places in their areas, where patients can isolated. RWAs have been asked to make isolation centres in their respective areas so that asymptomatic patients can be kept at these centres. By doing so, the spread of virus can be checked,” said Khatri.Khatri added that isolation centres in both urban and rural areas are being mapped and medical officers will be assigned to each of them so that they can regularly monitor the health of the patients who are kept in isolation centres. “If the health of a person in an isolation centre worsens and he or she needs to be admitted to a hospital, then arrangements can be immediately made after consulting with the associated medical officer,” said Khatri.Khatri specified that most Covid-19 cases in the city are asymptomatic in nature and that the administration, along with the health department, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), and the Gurugram Police, are coordinating and conducting an area-wise mapping of Covid-19 infected patients. A few of the RWAs in the city have already started making arrangements in this regard. The RWA of DLF Phase-2, for instance, has designated eight guest houses in their area that can accommodate more than 60 people. The RWA is also taking the help of private hospitals and clinics to procure medical supplies, such as oxygen cylinders, nursing staff, masks, gloves, and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. “We want to provide residents with an alternative option for isolating themselves if they contract the disease. Eight guest house owners in DLF Phase -2 have already come forward and we are also in the process of arranging the necessary medical equipment. We are expecting to have operational isolation centres in another two weeks,” said Gaurav Wahi, president of DLF Phase 2, RWA.At the Tulip Violet society in Sector 69, the RWA has reserved one vacant apartment as an isolation centre, which can accommodate eight people. The association is also looking to identify one more apartment for the same purpose.“Our first isolation centre will become operational from Saturday onwards. The builder has allowed us to use a four-bedroom vacant apartment as an isolation centre, while one of the residents who owns a furniture shop has arranged for eight beds. In addition, we have also managed to arrange for medical supplies from a private clinic,” said Puneet Goyal, president of Tulip Violet RWA. Goyal further said that the RWA is also speaking with the district administration for information on government-sanctioned medical clinics and hospitals through which they can purchase the necessary equipment and arrange for checkups for infected patients.The RWA is also looking to arrange for one more apartment in the condominium for isolation.At the Godrej Summit society in Sector 104, residents have tied up with a charitable hospital and established an isolation centre at a building in the society that was earlier reserved for creating a playschool. The isolation centre is due to become operational on Sunday.“Residents wanted to create a separate isolation centre within the condominium so that senior citizens, children, or other vulnerable residents can be immediately be quarantined. Presently, we have reserved four beds at the centre and can increase the capacity to 20,” said Bajrang Jain, a resident. Jain added that one of the residents who owns a charitable hospital in Sector 4 has arranged all the necessary medical equipment and has also promised to provide nursing staff and doctors if required. In DLF Phase-1, the RWA is also looking at establishing their community centre as an isolation centre. However, they are waiting for approval from residents living in its vicinity for approval. “We have identified a community centre in Block-F that can accommodate more than 35 people. Residents living next to the community centre have voiced some reservations on the matter.

While the clusters in-charge will be chosen from among the officials of the district administration, other government officials will serve as incident commanders. These officers will ensure the restriction of unnecessary movement of people in the existing 98 containment zones in the city to prevent the spread of Covid-19. As per official guidelines, a containment zone is declared only after five Covid-19 cases have been reported within the one-kilometre perimeter of an area from where the first case has been reported. Within the perimeter of the affected region, the incident commanders will coordinate with the local police officers to ensure that people are duly following the norms of social distancing. “The incident commanders will ensure, among other things, proper barricading of the area with only single entry and exit points. The team will also be required to maintain a movement logbook of medical emergency or essential services,” said an official of the district administration, privy to the matter. According to the official, strict measures need to be taken in the affected zones to break the chain of transmission. “For this, we will have to check the free movement of people in the area to contain the spread of the disease,” he said.The incident commanders will report to clusters in-charge, who in turn will submit regular updates regarding the enforcement of containment measures to the district administration. The decision to appoint officers for containent zones comes after the district administration increased the number of containment zones from 66 to 98 last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/district-administration-appoints-cluster-in-charge-for-containment-zones/story-3s0aC4TmGPtEQBOJuPRGGO.html

These are tough times. The coronavirus disease is spreading fast. We need to fight it together. This facility will be ready in another 2-3 days with 120 beds. Soon, the capacity will be ramped up to 250-300 beds,” said Kejriwal, who was accompanied to the five-star hotel by deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia and a group of doctors from Holy Family Hospital.“Similarly, around 30-35 more hotels in the city will be converted into hospitals. We aim to create around 3,000-3,500 beds in hotels alone. In this augmentation drive, all agencies are working together,” the CM said.Kejriwal had earlier said Delhi would need 150,000 beds as the number of Covid cases is expected to go up to 550,000 by July 31.Delhi on Tuesday recorded 1,859 new cases, taking the tally to 44,688. The government’s bulletin recorded new 93 deaths on the day as well.The chief minister’s visit lasted for 30 minutes – between 12.15 pm and 12.45 pm.This was the chief minister’s first such inspection and it came a day after the Delhi High Court allowed the government to use two city hotels as extended Covid facilities – Crowne Plaza in Okhla (attached with Batra Hospital) and Hotel Suryaa (with Apollo). Both hotels had moved the court against the government’s decision, following which the court had appointed a two-member committee to assess all factors and submit a feasibility report. The committee had on Monday said it was possible to use the hotels as Covid care centres for asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms.On Monday, Union home minister Amit Shah had visited Lok Nayak Hospital, Delhi’s city’s biggest Covid hospital, and on Sunday, lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal visited the premises of a spiritual organisation in south Delhi’s Chhattarpur where a shed is being converted into a makeshift hospital with 10,000 beds.“This is the beginning of a series of such inspections,” said an official in the chief minister’s office. In the next two weeks, around 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls, other than several sports complexes, will be converted into hospitals and quarantine centres. On Tuesday, the Delhi government issued two specific orders directing Hotel Surya and Taj Man Singh to be converted into Covid facilities, attached with hospitals.A senior government official privy to the augmentation drive said, “Currently, a portion of Hotel Surya that has 90 rooms, including 25 twin bedrooms, will be transformed into a Covid facility, available only to patients with mild symptoms referred by Holy Family Hospital. No direct admissions will be entertained as per protocol. In most cases, patients in the recovery stage will be referred so that hospital beds are available for severe cases.”An employee in the hotel management who did not wish to be identified said a batch of its 70 employees – ranging from housekeepers, laundry service providers and waiters to chefs, receptionists and managers -- will undergo a seven-day training starting Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-inspects-hotel-suryaa-says-will-make-space-for-300-beds/story-fGRrYq6ZV02OufwojbDXdI.html

The organisation offered to create a total capacity of 850 beds across these facilities to help meet the growing demand for hospital beds in the national capital amid a surge in Covid cases. Delhi on Tuesday recorded 1,859 new cases, taking the tally to 44,688. The DSGMC president wrote to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal in this connection, saying all facilities would be free of cost and that they just need the government to attach these to nearby hospitals so that doctors, nurses and paramedic staff could look after patients.With a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, the Delhi government has been preparing to turn hotels and banquet halls into makeshift hospitals, a move that is expected to add over 15,800 beds to the city’s health care infrastructure. “We have requested the government for its sanction and support so that we can start offering these services immediately. We will take care of all meals, drinking water, general medicines, oxygen cylinders as well as haematological and biochemistry laboratory services for the admitted patients,” said Manjinder Singh Sirsa, president, DSGMC. The facilities are proposed to be set up at Gurudwara Nanak Piao Sahib, Guru Harkrishan Yatri Niwas, Guru Arjan Dev Yatri Niwas, Guru Hargobind Institute of Management and Information Technology, Guru Har Kishan Public School, Gurudwara Damdama Sahib, Guru Tegh Bahadur Polytechnic Institute and Guru Nank Sukhshala. “This is a time of crisis and we wish to help people in anyway we can.

16-06-2020||Delhi||Satyendar Jain tests negative for Covid-19||Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain was admitted to Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital (RGSSH) on Tuesday after he developed a fever and his oxygen level dropped. He tested negative for Covid-19 later in the day, senior government officials said.“Due to high-grade fever and a sudden drop of my oxygen levels last night I have been admitted to RGSSH. Will keep everyone updated,” Jain tweeted on Tuesday morning.A senior government official said, “The minister has regularly been visiting hospitals and hot spots, and travelling around the city for Covid-19 management-related work. Tracing his contacts would have been an extremely difficult task. The chances of him being infected with the virus could also not be negated because around three weeks ago a staff member at the camp office outside Jain’s residence tested positive Covid-19, after which the office was sanitised. Such factors got everyone worried.”His swab samples were collected at the hospital around 11 am and the result was out by 1pm. Jain, however, is still in the hospital with oxygen support and he is likely to undergo another covid test tomorrow, “just to dismiss all possibilities or a false negative test result”, said the government official quoted above.Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had isolated himself at home after a bout of fever and a sore throat. He also tested negative for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/satyendar-jain-tests-negative-for-covid-19/story-TiIoXtDs0NSEX6S0idYxIK.html

In May, the university had said it would conduct offline exams for final-year students only if the Covid-19 situation in the city improved.However, the standing academic council last week decided not to go forward with the offline exams as cases are rising in the city. “The conduct of examination in the offline mode was found to be non-viable as the same may further compromise the well-being of students who are from different states,” the committee noted while referring to the increased number of Covid-19 cases in the city.The assessment of all final-year students, including undergraduate, postgraduate and MPhil, as well as PhD scholars, would be done on the basis of online exams. Teachers can use different modes of evaluation such as assignments, dissertations, or objective questions. Practical exams will also be conducted online via interviews and viva voce. Teachers have been asked to upload marks on the portal by June 20, media coordinator Ahmad Azeem said.A senior university official, requesting anonymity, said, “We had kept both online and offline modes in mind while planning the evaluation. During the online classes that were conducted earlier, we had asked teachers to collect online assignments and evaluate students based on those. This plan was put in place so that teachers could use these marks in case offline exams are not held.”Students of intermediate semesters are already being evaluated on the basis of online assignments. The university said that according to the University Grants Commission guidelines, no request for redressal or re-evaluation shall be admissible from such students.Discussions on our class group mostly revolved around concerns that there will be no re-evaluation or redressal. Students who had internet issues managed to submit their assignments with the help of friends,” said Shruty Yadav, a final-year undergraduate student, who is submitting around 20 assignments. The number of assignments submitted by students varied from course to course.“Students who could not appear for their papers as part of the odd semester exams held in the month of December 2019 and February 2020, owing to disruption due to walkout/boycott shall also be allowed to appear in a special examination held in September and October along with compartment exams,” the controller of exams said in a notice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/jamia-cancels-pen-and-paper-exams-will-assess-students-online/story-p1ifrCFHmzHNsv3WZVHEWM.html

16-06-2020||City||Behbal Kalan police firing: Advocate who aided cops in fabricating evidence against protesters held||The special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 police firings on people protesting the Bargari sacrilege in Faridkot have arrested the advocate who allegedly aided in making fabricated bullet marks on the escort vehicle of Charanjit Singh Sharma, former Moga senior superintendent of police and an accused in the Behbal Kalan case. It is the first arrest made since inspector general of police Paramraj Singh Umranangal was held in the Kotkapura firing case on Feb 19, 2020, and second in the Behbal Kalan firing after the SIT held Sharma in January last year. Inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who is a senior member of the SIT and recently took charge of the Behbal Kalan inquiry in addition to the Kotkapura case that he had been probing, said Sohali Singh Brar, a Faridkot-based lawyer, was arrested on Tuesday and will be produced in court on Wednesday.Two youths had died in police firing at Behbal Kalan on October 14, 2015, while protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari on October 12. Police had also opened fire on protesters at Kotkapura, leaving many injured, the same day.The SIT in its probe found that Charanjit Sharma conspired with three other police officers — Fazilka superintendent of police Bikramjit Singh, inspector Pardip Singh and sub-inspector Amarjit Singh Kular — to cover up facts related to the Behbal Kalan firing.SIT has claimed that to fabricate false evidence against the peaceful protesters, Charanjit’s escort Maruti Gypsy was taken to the advocate’s house, where Bikramjit and a car dealer had fired on it to make bullet marks. The same day, Kular, who was the Bajakhana station house officer, recorded the statements of Sharma, Bikramjit and Pardip Singh among others, in which they claimed that police fired in self-defence after protestors attacked them. According to the SIT, Sharma’s driver Gurnam Singh, who was behind the wheel in the escort vehicle, has confessed that protesters had fired no shot on the Gypsy. A case was registered against the unknown cops under Section 302 (murder) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code on October 21, 2017. Names of the four cops, including Sharma, were added in the FIR on August 11, 2018. Even as the SIT filed a challan againt Sharma in April 2019, the remaining three cops, who are out on bail, have not been chargesheeted yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/behbal-kalan-police-firing-advocate-who-aided-cops-in-fabricating-evidence-against-protesters-held/story-jGKunAcoMfEqk1RZJRFx8I.html

Addressing mediapersons, he alleged that the state government was taking this crisis lightly. Referring to the impending assembly bypoll for Baroda seat, the MP said “the BJP was already in election mode while the state was in the SOS mode”. “What is the BJP celebrating by holding political rallies across the state? Is the fight against coronavirus over?” he asked. Deepender said despite the fact that Covid-19 cases were increasing at a fast pace in Haryana, the state government was more interested in political propaganda than focusing on the deteriorating situation. “The BJP is more worried about the Baroda assembly bypoll than the safety and lives of the people. BJP MPs and ministers are flouting MHA guidelines by holding political meetings in Baroda and Gohana,” he alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bjp-jjp-govt-not-doing-enough-to-control-covid-deepender/story-RFeA0CupU7w1eRBa5pDhuL.html
16-06-2020||Chandigarh||Kurukshetra University raises students’ concern with government||Following the Haryana government’s notification directing all higher and technical education institutions across the state to conduct exams of final year students from July 1 to 31, Kurukshetra University has written to the government about the concerns raised by students appearing for exams. Less than two weeks are left for exams to commence, making it difficult for universities and colleges to make arrangements for students as many of them will be returning from other districts and parts of the state. Since the guidelines for exams were issued on June 12, students had been sending emails to the vice-chancellor and their teachers expressing their concerns about safety as well as inability to reach exam centres with several restrictions on movement still in place. They say even the syllabus of most of the courses has not been completed as the universities and colleges were shut in the first week of March. “We had on Monday held a meeting in this regard where we decided to raise all concerns of the students with Haryana government. We have already written to the government and waiting for its response on the problems highlighted by the students in their e-mails,” said Brajesh Sawhney, director, public relations, Kurukshetra University. He said the next decision will be made as per the guidelines of the government. According to a senior teacher of university, who sought to remain anonymous, besides transportation and accommodation issues, students are worried about pending syllabus. “As several top institutions of the country have already decided to promote their students, the Haryana government should also follow them as it is very difficult to conduct the exams,” he added. A senior functionary of Rohtak-based Maharshi Dayanand University, on condition of anonymity, said, “How could the exams be conducted in the prevailing situation. There is no clarity on the transportation and stay of the students coming from the different parts of the state. It is very risky for students to appear for exams as Covid-19 cases in most of the districts are on their peak.” Thousands of students studying in the colleges associated with state universities are waiting for the formal guidelines as well. “We are making arrangements to conduct exams of at least 1,000 final year students as per the government’s direction, but we are still waiting for the guidelines from Kurukshetra University,” said Abha Khetarpal, principal of DAV Girls College, Yamunanagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/kurukshetra-university-raises-students-concern-with-government/story-b24C2ZmW5otgL3LRPY4RxK.html

His statement demanding withdrawal of the ordinance is nothing but a ploy to inflame sentiments and play politics over a sensitive matter which concerns the welfare of the farmers,” he said.The SAD chief said instead of trying to divert attention from his own failures, the CM should take back the steep increase in value added tax (VAT) on petrol and diesel if he was really worried about the welfare of farmers and the common man.“While a hike of ₹2 was effected on both petrol and diesel on May 6, the government further announced an increase of ₹1.20 per litre on petrol and 0.53 paisa on diesel on June 15,” he said.Sukhbir accused the Congress and its president Sonia Gandhi of adopting double standards. He said while the Congress chief had written to the Prime Minister protesting against the hike in fuel prices, she seemed to have forgotten to tell her CM in Punjab not to profit from the misery of the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/don-t-mislead-farmers-on-agri-reform-ordinance-sukhbir-to-cm/story-Q9UuVDa1UgeI1iCXmS7KsK.html

Later, they called up the shop’s owner, Ajay Kumar, and threatened to kill him if he failed to pay ₹15 lakh by Thursday,” the SP said.“They were operating on the directions of a gangster Kirpal Singh, who is lodged in Sangrur jail. Further investigation is on. Police teams are conducting raids to nab the other accused,” he added.

In the fresh appeal in the HC, he said all charges against him were concocted due to some personal grudges and differences. But the state government opposed his plea, saying there is strong evidence against him and he was filing unnecessary petitions to delay the trial.On June 10, the Kottayam trial court took up the case after a long gap due to the lockdown and expressed serious reservation over Mulakkal’s continued absence and asked him to appear on July 1.The former bishop’s counsel had informed the court that he was not able to travel as there were no domestic flights from Jalandhar and he will have to undergo 14-day quarantine as per the government guidelines. But the court had asked him to make necessary arrangements in advance to appear on July 1.The case surfaced two years ago when the nun (43), a mother superior, filed a police complaint in Kottayam that Mulakkal raped her several times between 2014 and 2016. The nun is a member of the Missionaries of Jesus congregation in Punjab.A special investigation team (SIT) formed to probe the case arrested Mulakkal in September 2018. He was granted bail after spending 40 days in jail and was removed from the post of bishop later.The SIT filed the chargesheet against him last year. The nun had also complained that some of the witnesses were threatened by his supporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ex-jalandhar-bishop-moves-kerala-hc-seeks-quashing-of-rape-case/story-KYjwGzrkOBD3kWp1Iq2IAO.html

16-06-2020||City||State owes fund-starved Punjabi University ₹76 crore||The Punjab government has failed to clear ₹76 crore dues owed to Punjabi University, Patiala, which is toiling hard to meet its committed expenses. The pending dues include ₹46 crore related to postmatric scholarship for scheduled caste (SC) students, ₹21 crore for the varsity’s constituent colleges and ₹9 crore of the monthly grant.Amid the fund crunch, the university has failed to release salaries and pensions to its 5,800-odd present and former staffers for the month of May.Registrar Manjit Singh Nijjar says the university has again pressed upon social welfare and higher education departments for clearing the postmatric scholarship and constituent colleges funds at the earliest.“The social welfare department has audited records of SC students a number of times, but still the funds have not been cleared. We can only request the government for early disbursal,” he says, adding that the university is hopeful of receiving the monthly grant of ₹9 crore by the end of this week.The monthly salary budget of the university is pegged at ₹33 crore. However, the varsity’s fiscal health is not in a good shape. As per budgetary proposals for this fiscal, the varsity expects an income of ₹380 crore, while the expenditure is pegged at ₹676 crore, leaving a massive ₹296-crore deficit.Meanwhile, the government has added to its miseries, as not a single penny of ₹46 crore funds under the postmatric scholarship scheme has been paid since 2015. This includes funds meant for its neighbourhood campuses and regional centres as well. Earlier, the inordinate delay was due to faulty records sent by various departments and regional centres. Even as an audit cleared the discrepancies in 2018, the funds are still awaited.Vice-chancellor BS Ghuman, on his part, says the university officials are working round the clock to arrange funds for monthly expenses.Despite repeated attempts, minister for social justice, empowerment and minorities Sadhu Singh Dharamsot and Kirpa Shankar Saroj, additional chief secretary of the department, could not be reached for comment on postmatric scholarship scheme dues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/state-owes-fund-starved-punjabi-university-76-crore/story-NlhXNxftDGWzgyd7eNzquL.html

16-06-2020||City||J&K HC quashes PSA detention of NC leader Sagar||The Jammu and Kashmir high court on Tuesday quashed the detention of National Conference general secretary Ali Mohammad Sagar under the Public Safety Act, his lawyer and party leaders said on Tuesday.Sagar was detained along with dozens of other leaders on August 5 when J&K’s special status was revoked by the Centre and the region was split into two Union territories.The NC leader’s counsel Shariq Reyaz and his son Salman Sagar confirmed that the high court has quashed the preventive detention order. “Extremely happy to let all of you know that the PSA against Sagar sahab has been quashed by the J&K high court after the court proceedings which took six hearings,” Salam Sagar said. NC president Omar Abdullah tweeted: “The J&K high court has quashed the detention of my senior colleague @JKNC_ General Secretary Ali Mohd Sagar. Thankfully he challenged his detention even when those around him were reluctant to. This once again highlights the unjust and indefensible nature of the August 5 detentions.”Sagar, who has served as law, parliamentary affairs as well as rural development minister in J&K assembly, spent these 10 months in three temporary sub-jails—Centaur Hotel, MLA Hostel and finally at M5 government quarters on Gupkar Road. He was shifted to Gupkar in the first week of February after he was booked under the PSA following completion of his six months detention under preventive custody.On June 3, the J&K administration had revoked the PSA against bureaucrat-turned-politician Shah Faesal and two leaders of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) Sartaj Madani and Peer Mansoor. However, Faesal was put under house detention immediately after his release.Now, only three prominent leaders are under detention, including former chief minister Mehbooba Mufti and former ministers Nayeem Akthar from PDP and Hilal Akbar Lone, son of senior NC leader and sitting MP Mohammad Akbar Lone.Buoyed by the court judgment, Omar Abdullah urged Mehbooba Mufti to approach the Supreme Court. “I hope @MehboobaMufti’s legal team take heart from today’s judgement in the J&K high court quashing Sagar Sb’s PSA detention to pursue Ms Mufti’s case in the Supreme Court with increased determination and vigour. She deserves to be freed without further loss of time,” he said in another tweet.“Although Nayeem Sb & Hilal haven’t challenged their detentions in court, I hope the authorities see the writing on the wall and realise their continued PSA detention is indefensible. They must be released as must all others under illegal ‘house arrest’,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-hc-quashes-psa-detention-of-nc-leader-sagar/story-75DdYlQKCQXD4DvFyYJL4K.html

The accused have been identified as Ashad Shaikh, 24; Danish Shaikh, 21; and Tapaskumar Rai, 31. The police are on the lookout for one more accused in the case. The victim – Satish Rajbhar – was a resident of Chandivli. He had been for a walk and reached a commercial construction site at Sakinaka in Andheri (East) around 11 am, when the four accused, working there, spotted him. “The four accused thought that Rajbhar was a thief. They tied his hands and legs and assaulted him with plastic pipes and asked him why he had entered the premises. Rajbhar repeatedly told the accused that he had come for a walk and inadvertently reached the construction site. However, the accused assaulted him for around four hours,” said Kishor Sawant, senior inspector, Sakinaka police station.When Rajbhar passed out, the accused thought that he had died and fled the spot, said Sawant. A site supervisor who later visited the spot saw Rajbhar lying unconscious and immediately informed the police, following which a team of officers rushed him to Rajawadi Hospital at Ghatkopar, where he was declared dead on admission. “We learnt that the accused were migrant workers and immediately sent our teams to Bandra, Kurla and Andheri railway stations to trace them. The trio were arrested from Andheri station while they were buying tickets to return to their homes in Bihar,” said Sawant.The accused have been booked under sections 302 (Punishment for murder), 341 (Punishment for wrongful restraint) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/24-year-old-dies-after-4-assault-him-with-pipes-in-mumbai/story-N2JtZr2B86YZ5xzW1PbGrI.html

16-06-2020||City||Farmers, local labourers at loggerheads after migrant exodus in Amritsar||The exodus of migrant labourers due to the coronavirus pandemic has led to a change in relationship between farmers and local labourers in villages across Amritsar district.Agriculture in Punjab largely depends upon migrant workers who come from states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Their return to their home states has enhanced the importance of local labourers, who are mostly from scheduled caste communities and over the years had opted for other professions.With the paddy sowing season starting earlier this month, farmers are forced to hire services of these local labourers at much higher rates.It has also led to souring of relationships between farmers and local labourers, as is being witnessed at the border village of Pandoor in Ajnala subdivision.The village panchayat had passed a resolution fixing ₹3,000 per acre labour charges for sowing paddy, a decision that did not go down well with local labourers, who are demanding up to ₹4000 per acre. In fact, migrant labourers were ready to work for even ₹2,500 per acre. Due to the labourers’ “hefty demand”, farmers did not engage them, says sarpanch Baljit Singh, adding that in turn the labourers, including women, are not even willing to do domestic work for the farmers. Robin Masih, a local labour union leader, alleges that farmers, who are from Jat community and are in majority in the village, have been threatening the labourers, who were already hit by the lockdown. Locals say the two groups even clashed on Sunday, during which even shots were fired. The authorities say those who opened fire will be booked.Baldev Singh Pandori, a state committee member of the labourers organisation Dihati Mazdoor Sabha, says as migrant labourers were ready to work in the fields for lower wages, farmers had stopped hiring Punjabi labourers. “Now, they have to return to them. Upliftment of Punjabi labourers in natural in such a situation,” he says.However, farmers complain that due to their lack of experience, local labourers take more time to sow paddy.Gurpreet Singh is one such labourer who is trying his hands at sowing paddy at Bal Sikandar village after the lockdown hit cabbies in Amritsar. “I am a taxi driver. But the lockdown has left me in the lurch. With tourists not visiting Amritsar, I am struggling to even buy groceries. I have to pay loans too. So, I decided to go for paddy sowing to earn some money,” he says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/farmers-local-labourers-at-loggerheads-after-migrant-exodus-in-amritsar/story-T8RsAYl6kTRKl8nTP0QYZL.html

It was the state’s moral duty to bring them back. These people were evacuated in buses and thirteen special trains.“This, however, has resulted in sharp increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in Himachal, but couldn’t have left our own people to their fate,” said Thakur.He said all people coming from other parts of the country have been kept under institutional or home quarantine, and Himachal’s overall situation was far better than the neighbouring states.Thakur added that the Prime Minister had appreciated the state’s strategy of Active Case Finding (ACF) campaign to trace infected persons.He thanked the people of Jaswan Pragpur for contributing about ₹35 lakh towards the HP Covid Response.Apart from donations, the people of Jaswan Pragpur distributed about 65,000 masks and 1,800 Modi Kits to the needy.Speaking on the occasion, Union minister of state for finance and corporate affairs Anurag Thakur said the six-year tenure of the Narendra Modi government has paved the way for a new, strong and vibrant India. He said the Union government has announced a ₹20-lakh crore economic package that envisages support to every section of the society for their economic revival. He also detailed various developmental programmes launched by the Union government.Industries minister and local MLA Jaswan Pragpur Bikram, Dehra district BJP president Sanjeev Sharma and Jaswan Pragpur block president Vinod Sharma also spoke on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/covid-19-forced-governments-to-rethink-and-reframe-policies-himachal-cm/story-VZv8gyqbHzAs6zMg4n0jUN.html

These PACS include 1,914 fair price shops and 1,374 fertilizer depots.He said efforts should be made to strengthen PACS so that state’s farmers get maximum benefits.He revealed that two integrated cooperative development projects (ICDP) were being implemented in Solan and Mandi districts with the block cost of ₹73.15 crore and ₹89.58 crore respectively.He said the state government was also planning to constitute a three-member committee of cabinet ministers to look into the amendments in the HP Cooperative Societies Act, 1968, to make it more viable and practical, keeping in view the present scenario.Thakur also expressed concern over the non-performing assets (NPAs) particularly in case of Kangra Central Cooperative Bank.Cooperation minister Rajiv Saizal, chief secretary Anil Khachi, principal secretary finance Prabodh Saxena, principal secretary to CM J C Sharma, secretary cooperative Akshay Sood and registrar cooperative societies Dr Ajar Sharma was among others present on the occasion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-govt-mulling-to-promote-agricultural-cooperatives-as-multipurpose-service-centres/story-B7bzOYnWubX65lyLTU8IHM.html
16-06-2020||City||Junaid Azim Mattu loses no-confidence motion, removed as Srinagar mayor||Junaid Azim Mattu was on Tuesday removed as the Srinagar municipal corporation (SMC) mayor after he lost a no-confidence motion moved against him by some corporators. The People’s Conference leader, whose election as Srinagar mayor had generated controversy two years ago, took to Twitter to announce his defeat. “The vote of ‘No Confidence Motion’ against me, and the @JKPC_ (Jammu and Kashmir People’s Conference) has been passed in the SMC with 42 votes out of 70. The @BJP4India, @JKNC_ (Jammu and Kashmir National Conference) and some independents have polled against the @JKPC_ and @INCIndia abstaining whip where 28 corporators abstained,” Mattu tweeted soon after losing the no-confidence motion at the city’s banquet hall. “I respect the verdict of the corporation,” he said. Mattu, who has survived a no-confidence motion in the past, claimed the Bharatiya Janata Party and the National Conference have joined hands in Srinagar. “The seemingly unthinkable seems to have happened as @JKNC_ and @BJP4India have come together in Srinagar,” he tweeted. Mattu said he is taking the verdict with humility and his chin up. Also, the National Conference expelled four corporators from the party for voting in a no-confidence motion which resulted in Mattu’s removal as mayor of the SMC. “Ghulam Nabi Sufi, Danish Bhat, Neelofar and Majid Shulloo have been expelled after they defied the party whip to abstain from voting on the no-confidence motion,” NC spokesman Imran Nabi Dar said in a statement. “They have been expelled from the basic membership of the party for violating the whip,” he said.Even after the expulsion of NC corporators, Mattu was critical of the party. In another tweet, he said: “After a near unanimous resolution of the council to remove the former deputy mayor who had joined hands with the BJP during his incarceration—the @JKPC_ officially extended support to @INCIndia for the post of deputy mayor. And here is where things get interesting: The @JKNC_ yet again refused to be a part of the greater- @JKPC_ @INCIndia, and JKNC ‘alliance’ limited to SMC when the current deputy mayor (an NC nominee) thwarted the JKPC-INC alliance by engineering two factions within @INCIndia in the SMC—with an eye on the post.”He further tweeted:…“Didn’t want to speak about technical realities of today’s floor test in SMC and it’s result but the record needs to be set straight about @JKNC_’s exclusive and facilitatory role in ensuring the success of the BJP-engineered, orchestrated and backed ‘No Confidence Motion’.”“Today’s ‘No Confidence Motion’ is an eventual consequence—yet again instigated by the National Conference in SMC. You can’t claim votes against BJP nominees and then join them post elections!’’ The BJP said it had nothing to do with the no-confidence motion. However, political analysts say that this move was jointly taken by independent legislators with the support of BJP.The Congress, which has 17 corporators, had issued a whip asking its members not to take part in the no-confidence proceedings. Mattu, 35, had resigned from the National Conference only to participate in the polls in 2018. A former financial analyst who returned from the US barely a decade ago to join politics, he is also one of the senior leaders of the People’s Conference led by Sajjad Lone.The term of the mayor and the deputy mayor is 30 months and both office bearers have to seek a fresh mandate from the corporators. They have more than 18 months to seek a fresh mandate within the corporation. Interestingly, Mattu had secured 40 votes to win the election in 2018 and the BJP corporators had supported him. He bagged more than 45 votes last year to defeat the no confidence motion and then deputy mayor Sheikh Imran who was in jail was also removed. However, Imran has been released and is now on the forefront of becoming the new Srinagar MC mayor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/junaid-azim-mattu-loses-no-confidence-motion-removed-as-srinagar-mayor/story-TLY0fFHBl1eQpRT6F4d0VN.html

Soon after shooting his uncle Sukhdev Singh, the 22-year-old accused Judgevir Singh shot himself. He is being treated at a private hospital in Tarn Taran and his condition is said to be stable. The incident took place at around 2 am when the victim Sukhdev and other family members were asleep, police said.

The clinical exam for clinical science subjects tests the knowledge and competence of candidates undertaking independent work as a specialist or teacher. For this the candidates have to examine a minimum of one long clinical case and two short cases, according to the Postgraduate Medical Education Regulations for MD, MS degrees and postgraduate diploma courses.Now, alternative methods of skill evaluation such as simulation and case scenarios can be used, MCI secretary general Dr Rakesh Kumar Vats has said in a letter released on Tuesday.The state government had suggested to the MCI-BoG to consider modifying the conduct of the practicals amid the pandemic situation for the safety of the students. Dr Vats in his letter said due to the Covid-19 pandemic, most of the medical colleges had expressed their difficulty in adhering to existing regulations to examine the candidates by giving a minimum of one long or two short cases. Since the objective of the practical examination was to ascertain skills relevant to the specialty as outlined in the respective course curricula, alternative methods of skill evaluation which may include simulation, case scenarios etc. may be used in lieu of clinical cases, wherever the latter is not feasible as provided for the regulations referred above for the examination to be held in 2020. “This is a one-time exception,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/mci-relaxes-rules-for-md-ms-clinical-course-practicals/story-9vyFSxshjPLB9SUW5C3UuK.html

State revenues have declined drastically, we are unable to pay the instalments this quarter. The government pays nearly Rs 800 crore in quarterly instalments for various loans for developmental activities to the Centre. We have to keep some money in our coffers as buffer,” said the finance department official who wished to remain anonymous.With a budgetary layout of ₹49,131 crore this year the government was expecting an 11% increase in revenues this year before the Covid-19 outbreak sent the economy in a tailspin.SGDP also likely to see a dipThe state gross domestic product (SGDP) is also likely to see a dip as most businesses have been closed for about three months.An analysis of the state’s expenditure reveals that the government will be spending ₹13,099 crore on salaries, ₹7,266 crore on pensions and ₹4,931.92 crore on repayment of loans and interests during the current financial year.Besides, several state-funded projects are at the execution stage. Income in the first quarter of this fiscal is negative.The only relief Himachal received was the revenue deficit grant received from the Centre of ₹950 crore each for May and June.GST share of ₹612 crore was also received in February and now revenues from liquor sales have started coming in.Borrowing limits have also been increased by 3% through an amendment in the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM) Act.Shopkeepers want electricity, water bill waiverWith business almost at a standstill after the Covid-19 outbreak, the business community in Shimla is demanding waiver on electricity and water bills. Shimla Beopar Mandal president Inderjit Singh said, “As we are hardly getting any business, the government should waive off water and electricity bills. It should also defer EMI payments. Hoteliers in Shimla have refused to resume operations since there are no tourists.”Hoteliers have already approached the government asking them to waive off electricity and water bills. They have also demanded waiving off the sewerage cess.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/economy-hit-by-covid-19-crisis-hp-govt-struggling-to-repay-rs-800-crore-loan/story-Vf2islxYwjQhqtw9ZSAX8J.html

After the government informed the court that it had issued a notification on Monday, stating that schools for students up to Class 2 will not be reopen till September, the court sought to know about the status of commencement of classes for children up to the 14 years of age as sought by the petitioner.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice K K Tated, while hearing the PIL filed by a non-governmental organisation (NGO) Ezra Foundation, through video conferencing was informed by advocates Shashikant Chaudhari and Manoj Kumar Singh that the health and well-being of the students between six and 14 years will be put to risk if they are asked to attend school during the coronavirus outbreak. The petitioners also argued that asking them to attend classes online for elongated periods would also pose a threat to their health and many parents would also not be in a position to provide facilities for children to attend the online classes. In the light of these submissions the advocates sought directions to the state to refrain from starting schools for this age group till September.The petitioners also submitted that due to the financial problems being faced by parents during the lockdown, the state should frame guidelines for a “common fee structure” for private schools for the academic year 2020-21. Their advocates also informed the court that there were many schools that were forcing parents to pay fees for the academic year 2020-21 though there were no classes being held and hence there should be a court-monitored committee for framing guidelines of opening of schools across the state and preparing a list of erring schools that are charging fees and revoking their registration.The court then wanted to know the status of reopening of school for students upto the age of 14 years, to which advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni said the state will file its response by Friday to which the court agreed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/when-will-schools-for-children-between-6-14-years-start-bombay-hc-asks-maharashtra-government/story-nJ0l9eEkpXccBp4WGfZmbI.html
16-06-2020||Chandigarh||IMA Punjab calls medical bandh on June 23 to protest Clinical Establishments Act||Doctors on Tuesday said they will observe a complete medical bandh on June 23 to oppose the implementation of the Clinical Establishments Act, which is to come to force from July 1. The move comes even as the state is grappling with the Covid-19 crisis. The Ludhiana branch of the Indian Medical Association (IMA) also burnt the copies of the act.IMA Ludhiana president Dr Sunil Katyal said the act was completely uncalled for and mistimed.He said doctors were already governed by the Punjab Medical Council (PMC) and National Medical Council (NMC/MCI), and hospital buildings are governed by building regulation norms and many hospitals are being accredited by National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare Providers (NABH). “The introduction of this act will achieve nothing extra, except for the harassment of doctors,” Katyal said. IMA Ludhiana honorary secretary Dheeraj Aggarwal said the act was against people, patients, the poor and doctors.“It will lead to an increase in hospital charges and treatment costs. The private health care delivery in Punjab was already of high quality as around 70% patients seek treatment at private setups than from government hospitals.The states where the act has been implemented do not show any improvement in health care delivery,” Aggarwal said. Punjab State governing Council joint action committee co-chairperson Dr Manoj K Sobti said, “We are opposing this act completely. Today a memorandum was given to the Ludhiana additional deputy commissioner AS Bains and it will be given to different leaders and officials. IMA Punjab has announced a complete medical bandh on June 23, if their demands are not met. If the government will not address their problems then a meeting will be held on June 28 to discuss the future course of action,” said Dr Sobti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ima-punjab-calls-medical-bandh-on-june-23-to-protest-clinical-establishment-act/story-tZ985xyVq3q2VdtfoWGNMJ.html

The poem, which was published on YouTube and Facebook in collaboration with ‘Sounds of Sahit’, urges women to not let the society stunt their ambition or impugn their worth. Gill writes, “Do sone de kadde pa o hathkadi pahnonge, tu sone warg khud nu banona aa, Oh shayad teri kadar na paa sakan dhiye, par tu apna mul app hi pana hai (They will give you two gold bangles to imprison you like handcuffs, but you must polish yourself like gold; they may not understand your worth but you must determine your own value)’On her inspiration for the poem, the 32-year-old poet, says, “The cause is close to my heart. It is a gift for my two daughters aged seven and two.”On her tryst with Punjabi poetry, Gill says she was inspired by the writings of her grandfather Gurnam Singh Tir, a humorist and writer of the popular ‘Chacha Chandigarhia’ column, and her mother Bubbu Tir.Her writings primarily focus on women-centric issues. “I don’t write poetry very often. But when I do, it is in Punjabi and on subjects close to my heart.Gill has penned around eight poems so far and plans to release an anthology someday.Catch it Live: https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=148750086772114&id=101854821461641https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=brJWJ9nPgcs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/poet-seerat-kaur-gill-s-poem-diamonds-on-earth-encourages-women-to-achieve-their-potential/story-BmOQGecdDY5zgQM2L8KnTO.html
16-06-2020||Pune||Covid-19 likely to put Pune’s 4 mega projects like HCMTR on hold||To efficiently tackle the strain on city’s health infrastructure due to the Covid-19 pandemic, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has decided to tighten its purse strings. Mega infrastructure projects like the high capacity mass transport route (HCMTR), redevelopment of Sarasbaug, two grade separators and flyovers are likely to be put on hold by the civic body.​According to Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad, a recent circular by the state government asked civic bodies, including PMC, to avoid starting new projects.​“It’s a fact that Covid-19 has resulted in reduced revenue for PMC and the state government. Recently, the state government issued a circular to civic bodies and instructed them to avoid kick-starting new projects. The state government instructed government departments to keep projects on hold if they are not needed urgently,” Gaikwad said.​Some civic body departments have received instructions from senior officials to go slow on new projects, a PMC official said. The civic body had proposed some of these projects in its annual budget for the ongoing financial year. “The list of projects which are likely to go on hold is yet to be made, but our efforts are to include projects considering the estimate of the upcoming revenue. Projects like HCMTR and Sarasbaug can be executed later and so, PMC will be able to focus on important issues such as health,” Gaikwad said. ​HCMTR is a 30-year-old project also known as the inner ring road worth over Rs 5,000 crore. The proposed project promises to ease traffic congestion in the central parts of the city. The Sarasbaug redevelopment was proposed this year on a public-private partnership basis through which PMC proposed to build an underground parking lot and develop a food mall. ​Besides HCMTR and the Sarasbaug project, a grade separator at Kasba peth and two flyovers proposed by PMC are also likely to go on hold. ​PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne had made a Rs230-crore provision for proposed flyovers and grade separators in the city. One flyover is proposed near Market Yard and a grade separator has been proposed at Kasba eth. At least Rs20 crore has been proposed for a cultural academy at Kothrud.PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasne, said, “It is true that the state government issued a circular for not taking up new projects, but the financial year has just started. The lockdown has only affected economic activity over the past two months and now, businesses are starting. Being the standing committee chairman, I took a lot of effort to get more revenue for the civic body by introducing new resources. If projects like HCMTR are passed, it would require very little expenditure in the first year. The administration will require at least six months for the tender process to complete.”​Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “While putting projects on hold the administration should keep in mind that a project like the HCMTR has already been delayed. If it is delayed further, the project cost would increase. It is better to keep the process going on.”Civic activist Vijay Kumbhar said that many schemes proposed in this year’s financial budget were unwanted like erecting foot overbridges at various places. “The concept of foot overbridges is not popular in the city. It is good that considering the Covid-19 situation, PMC has decided to concentrate on key issues rather than beautification and unnecessary projects.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/covid-19-likely-to-put-pune-s-4-mega-projects-like-hcmtr-on-hold/story-MAWjcMus1ZaWq5E4gqfgVI.html

16-06-2020||Chandigarh||PU researchers look into methods of reusing PPEs||Researchers at the Panjab University (PU) department of microbiology are looking into methods of reusing personal protective equipment (PPE) as medical waste has been increasingly accumulating in the wake of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Disposable surgical masks, N95 respirators and surgical gowns are made of non-biodegradable polypropylene, polystyrene or polyethylene while the face shields and goggles are made of polycarbonate or acrylic. Their single-use generates tonnes of waste everyday. The department is researching methods to decontaminate PPEs.PU dean science Prince Sharma said, “Ordinary methods such as washing the waste with detergent, alcohol, sanitisers or bleach have failed. It is not an easy task and while readying the disposed-off PPEs for reuse; care has to be taken to decontaminate the pathogen and ensure its validation. There should be no change in the filtering and material properties or any deformity in its fit.”Sharma and Dr Naveen Gupta of the microbiology department are already testing different methods that can be used for making PPE kits reusable.“We are testing methods such as mild heat, UV irradiation and mild chemicals such as hydrogen peroxide for treating used masks, respirators, face shields and gowns so as to reuse them,” he said.“The reuse of PPEs is a matter of environmental concern and safety, besides being economical,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/pu-researchers-look-into-methods-of-reusing-ppes/story-hdYXVlP1KasU1EhBsRIO7J.html

DB Sharma, the deputy director of the Gangotri National Park, said the footage of the snow leopard was captured by the park’s staff in Sonam area on Sunday.“The video shows a snow leopard climbing a rocky mountainside in the park. This shows that snow leopards are flourishing in the park and hopefully their numbers have increased,” Sharma said.“This has brought us some cheer as last week we had lost one snow leopard in the park, whose carcass was spotted by the patrolling staff,” he said.He was referring to the seven-year-old female snow leopard, who was found dead near the Nelong Valley in the Gangotri National Park on June 9.Watch: Snow leopard climbs rocky cliff in Uttarakhand’s Gangotri National ParkA video clip of a snow leopard crossing a road near the Nelong Valley was captured in August last year by an Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) official, who shared it with forest officials. The leopard was sighted at the Naga tri-section point, around 10km ahead of Nelong valley at an altitude of around 4,000 metre.Four snow leopards, including a pair, were seen on camera traps in Nanda Devi National Park between January to March this year.Similarly, four snow leopards were caught on camera traps in January by the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) in the state’s Gori Valley in Pithoragarh district. WWF, working on community conservation of snow leopards in Gori Valley, had shared the images. Snow leopard (Panthera uncia) is facing threats due to poaching and habitat destruction. It inhabits the Himalayas at elevations ranging from 3,000 to 4,500 metres. A Schedule I animal under the Wildlife Protection Act of India, it is listed as “endangered” by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India (WII) has made an estimate on the population of snow leopards based on an extrapolation from their habitat quality and their density. S Sathyakumar, a senior scientist with WII, has said India likely has around 516 snow leopards, with the current estimated distribution of these animals across Himalayan states to be around 86 in Uttarakhand, 90 in Himachal Pradesh, 285 in Jammu and Kashmir, 13 in Sikkim and 42 in Arunachal Pradesh.Gangotri National Park, established in 1989, is located in Uttarkashi district in the upper catchment of the Bhagirathi River and covers 1,553sqkm area in the altitude ranging 1800 to 7083 metres.

He found that diesel was illegally being transported on the tractor-trolley. Singh, who was on a motorcycle, asked the accused Dhanpat Patel and Pramod Patel, both residents of Chitrakoot district in Uttar Pradesh, to follow him to the police station with the tractor-trolley.Iqbal said the accused followed Singh for some distance but suddenly turned towards Uttar Pradesh. When the constable tried to stop them he was run over by the accused and killed.

16-06-2020||Chandigarh||Reinstate 1,983 physical training instructors: Surjewala to Khattar govt||Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala on Monday urged chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar to reinstate the sacked 1,983 physical training instructors by issuing an ordinance and ratifying it later through a Bill passed by the Haryana assembly. A single bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court had in 2012 set aside the 2010 selection of such instructors on account of changes made in the selection process. An HC division bench had upheld the decision of the single bench. The Supreme Court had on April 8 also upheld the HC decision.In a letter addressed to the Haryana CM, Surjewala suggested a draft Bill for providing security of service to physical training instructors in the ‘interest of justice’. “I urge upon you to take immediate steps to ensure that these 1,983 physical training instructors and their families are not abandoned to the vagaries of unemployment. They and their families will suffer disproportionately given the circumstances that Covid and the lockdown have created as also the fact that all of them are overage and unlikely to secure any other employment,” Surjewala said.Calling their removal insensitive, he said the teachers were innocent and the court has not held them guilty for any corruption or procedural lapses by the recruiting authority. The Supreme Court neither found corruption in the selection process nor any malicious act by any of the selected teachers, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/reinstate-1-983-physical-training-instructors-surjewala-to-khattar-govt/story-Hyv6rAwgBLMoZuNzuF8f1J.html

16-06-2020||Patna||Nitish Kumar nudges banks for better credit flow||Chief minister Nitish Kumar Monday asked bankers to ramp up the annual credit plan (ACP) with a view to improving the credit flow in the state to aid government’s efforts to create adequate job opportunities for migrant workers who wish to stay back and work here.The chief minister, who was addressing bankers at the 72nd state level bankers committee meeting, said people of the state are inclined to deposit their savings with the banks. “But against a deposit mobilization of Rs 3,71,783 crore in 2019-20, banks have disbursed loans worth Rs 1,52,257 crore in Bihar and deployed the rest in developed states. Bankers must reverse the trend and contribute in bolstering economic activities and job creation by pushing up the dismal C:D ratio of 43.03% somewhere near the national average,” he said.The first step would be to increase the ACP target and, at the same time, augment their branch presence at the panchayat level to ensure that none of the 8,386 panchayat remains without a bank branch. “We are ready to provide space in panchayat bhawans and government buildings as banking presence will help boost credit flow into labour intensive micro, small and medium enterprise sector, along with agriculture and allied activities (animal husbandry), handicraft and handloom sectors for creating job opportunities,” he said.The chief minister’s remark came in the backdrop of a continued slide in C:D ratio, from 45.38% in 2017-18 to 44.04% in 2018-19, and, now, to 43.03% in 2019-20 and a stagnation in the ACP targets for financial year 2020-2021--the same as FY 2019-20--at Rs 1,45,000 crore at a time when the state was in the midst of a pressing need to accommodate its non-resident workers in the wake of a reverse migration triggered by Covid-19 induced lockdown.Kumar said banks must take up the task to open an account for everybody and also increase the credit limit for over 9.5 lakh self-help groups (SHGs) to Rs 3-10 lakh from the current limit of Rs 1-5 lakh. “Similarly issuance of kisan credit card (KCC) should be stepped up as only 50,000 new KCC have been issued, against 3.70 lakh fresh applications. The access to subsidized credit invariably goes a long way in spurring agriculture-related activities,” he said.The CM appreciated bankers for carrying out banking operations, during the lockdown period, which, he said, helped the state in ensuring direct benefit transfer into the accounts of beneficiaries to the tune of Rs 8,500 crore.Deputy chief minister-cum-finance minister Sushil Kumar Modi, in his video interaction with media persons, said the government has laid down its expectations from the banks, as it was the first SLBC meeting of the current fiscal and major part of the first quarter remained under lockdown.As for the loan disbursal of Rs 1,05,400 crore that stood at 72.69% of the ACP target of Rs 1,45,000 crore for 2019-20, Modi said that the bankers attributed it to prevailing slowdown and beginning of the imposition of lockdown in the month of March. “We are in the process of mitigating their concern regarding verification of land possession by providing then direct online access to land records for loan purposes,” he said.Deputy CM said that as many as 17 banks have been identified as laggards in loan disbursal and the ACP achievement in 27 districts have been found to be way behind the average performance. “We will keep a close watch and also ensure that nearly 12 lakh dairy farmers, who are also the members of COMPFED, are provided KCC to have access for soft loans for expanding their business,” Modi said.Besides them, 74,000 street vendors have been identified for providing financial assistance of Rs 10,000 and 23,951 collateral free loan beneficiaries are being sanctioned Rs 638 crore as part of the initiative to provide them 20% additional working capital to tide over the crisis caused by lockdown. “The extension in moratorium period for farmers, from June to August 31, will benefit 11.39 lakh KCC holders,” the deputy CM said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/nitish-kumar-nudges-banks-for-better-credit-flow/story-68T7DcBdjEbxpJXkXfkVAN.html

16-06-2020||Jaipur||Rajasthan offers Covid testing facility to neighbouring states||With Covid-19 cases increasing in neighbouring states, the Rajasthan government has offered testing facilities of up to 5,000 samples daily to neighbouring states.“In times of this crisis, neighbouring states which are overloaded with patients and short of testing facilities can get tests done in Rajasthan,” Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said at a meeting to review the pandemic situation in the state. Gehlot said States such as Delhi, Haryana, Gujarat, Punjab, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh could get tests for their patients done in Rajasthan.“If the government has testing facilities then why don’t they use it for people of Rajasthan first before trying to win cheap popularity by offering it to other states,” he said.He said if 25,000 tests were actually being carried out, Rajasthan would have been able to control coronavirus till now.Jitendra Chaudhary, head of the lab technicians association at SMS hospital, said using the CB-NAAT machines and pooled testing technique has helped to ramp up testing capacity in the state. There are 72 CB-NAAT machines being used for Covid testing. ICMR approved these diagnostic machines which are used for testing TB to be used for Covid testing.Dr Virendra Singh, a member of the CM’s advisory committee on Covid-19 said that Rajasthan has more capacity to test than the samples received and so for a limited time period, testing facility can be extended to other statesHe said while the testing capacity is adequate, the government should try to shorten the time lag in testing and providing reports. “Reports should be available to patients within 6-8 hours instead of 2-3 days.”While the state is increasing testing capacity across districts, it is declining in Jaipur because there is pressure of testing from other neighbouring districts in the Covid-19 testing centres. Of the total samples, 34% are those from other districts such as Tonk, Dausa, Karauli, Alwar and Bharatpur.Till now, some 1.3 lakh Covid-19 samples have been tested in five centres in Jaipur. Of these, 89,000 tests were of Jaipur and the rest were from other districts.Currently testing is being carried out in 16 districts in the state though the chief minister and health minister have said that testing facilities will soon be developed in all 33 districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/jaipur/rajasthan-offers-covid-testing-facility-to-neighbouring-states/story-HPzjLazNMFIZ2XyjeBFOGI.html

16-06-2020||City||This academic year, no online sessions till Class 2 for students in Maharashtra||Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in a meeting with state education minister Varsha Gaikwad on Monday, approved the standard operating procedures (SOP) submitted by the education department on June 12 to reopen schools and regulate online learning.As per the SOPs, the new academic year for students across the state will commence from June 15 and schools begin online learning for the first few months. Both private and government-aided schools will not be allowed to conduct online classes for students up to Class 2. These students can be asked to listen to radio programmes and TV content on education once the state government rolls it out. Students of Class 3-5 can only be asked to sit for up to an hour a day, Class 6-8 can be asked to attend up to two hours a day and Class 9-12 can be held for a maximum of three hours a day. Schools will also have to ensure that students are given enough breaks between two classes. “We understand that parents might be under stress due to the current situation and the resulting uncertainty. We have released these SOPs to bring more clarity about what the government is going to do to ensure that students do not miss out on learning even in places where schools cannot be reopened soon,” said Gaikwad at an event held by the Maharashtra State Council of Educational Research and Training (MSCERT) on Monday afternoon.The department plans to initiate phase-wise reopening of schools in areas where there has not been a single Covid-19 case for at least a month from July. Schools can first start sessions for Classes 9, 10 and 12 in July, followed by Classes 6 to 8 from August and Classes 3 to 5 from September. For Classes 1 and 2, a decision on reopening schools can be taken by the school management committee in consultation with the local administration. First-year junior colleges will start after the admission process is complete, after Class 10 results are declared. Decisions with respect to physically reopening schools in containment zones will be taken by the local administration. From June 15 to June 29, schools have been asked to conduct online meetings with school management committees, coordinate with local managements, create awareness among parents, contact vulnerable children who are at a risk of dropping out, brief parents about online learning and stay in touch with students on a day-to-day basis. For schools in the Vidarbha region, this process would begin from June 26, as schools usually reopen there two weeks later. On Monday, several schools started their online classes for students. “It was a good experience and everyone is learning to adapt to technology,” said Uday Nare, teacher and Hansraj Morarji Public School in Andheri.

16-06-2020||City||Mumbai sees rise in Covid deaths||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has another cause for concern in the battle against Covid-19 this month – the rising fatality rate. On June 1, there were 3.2% deaths compared to the number of cases; the percentage rose to 3.5 on June 10, 3.6% on June 12 and 3.7% on June 14, 3.79% on June 15, according to data from the Maharashtra government. On June 1, the number of cases in Mumbai was 41,099, with 1,319 deaths. On June 14, Mumbai had 58,226 cases and 2,182 deaths. On June 15, the city saw a total of 2,250 deaths with 59,293 cases.“We are watching the rise in daily deaths and are studying the patterns and likely causes. There are multiple reasons why fatalities are on the rise,” said a member of the state government’s task force formed in April to curb Covid deaths.BMC officials were unavailable for a comment.Experts have attributed the rise to delay in reportage, especially in cases of co-morbidities; lack of bed and ambulance availability, which force patients to wait for hours, leading to loss of precious time. They said another factor is overcharging by private hospitals, despite the government cap, which discourages patients from approaching any available hospital.On May 26, in a video conference, municipal commissioner IS Chahal said he aimed to bring down the deaths to 3% from then 3.2%. “We have managed to bring down Mumbai’s death rate to 3.2% from the high figure of more than 7% recorded in April. This happened due to targeted measures taken by the civic body. In a few days, the rate will drop further.”Mumbai was successful in bringing down the numbers earlier, thanks to contact-tracing and early detection of high-risk co-morbid persons, shifting such persons to government facilities for observation, detecting elderly and co-morbid patients with low oxygen saturation, streamlining rules of dialysis, Chahal had said.Madhav Sathe, retired professor of microbiology at Nair Hospital, said, “There are many reasons. Firstly, people do not have the confidence to report Covid-19 symptoms for reasons such as overcharging by private hospitals or the long wait in queues to get a bed, as reports have suggested so far. Second is lack of beds and ambulances. New treatment modalities – Remdesivir - an antiviral drug, and Tocilizumab - an immuno-modulant drug needs to be introduced urgently.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-sees-rise-in-covid-deaths/story-aSKni1RTUMNnoXN1tlXWUP.html

A Mumbai-based caterer, who until March was supplying food for major events, started organising and distributing food for the needy in Mumbai. Bandra-resident Ashfaaq Shaikh has been distributing 1,800-2,000 meals every day in areas around Bandra, including Behrampada and in Khar Danda. “When the lockdown was announced, we were quite devastated, considering the losses we will face,” said Shaikh, who founded his catering business in 2015.“I thought about the countless others who would have lost their jobs. So I got in touch with my family and friends and started arranging for meals,” he said. Shaikh’s team prepares meals like dal-rice, rajma-rice, khichdi, veg pulao and egg-biryani, which they then distribute among the needy.Shaikh has also volunteered with Khaana Chahiye, a city-based initiative that has been providing food for migrant workers, the homeless and underprivileged residents of the city. Shaikh said, “With the Khaana Chahiye team, we used to distribute close to 800-1,000 food packets in Mahim, Bandra, Vile Parle and Juhu.”Led by the non-governmental organisation (NGO) Project Mumbai and the Litmus Test Project collective, Khaana Chahiye began its activities on March 29 and has distributed 37 lakh meals so far. Chief executive officer (CEO) of Project Mumbai, Shishir Joshi said, “With Khaana Chahiye, we grew a strong volunteer base of 150 people from diverse sectors who came out to help. We also created a map where people who could fill in details about those who needed help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ht-salutes-caterer-in-mumbai-distributes-2-000-meals-daily-to-the-needy/story-Txb4Pe9sbNMZ4J1kS0ZuWI.html
16-06-2020||Mumbai||Change in colour of Lonar lake: Bombay HC convenes special sitting to issue directions to authorities||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Monday passed a slew of directives to protect and preserve the 113-hectare Lonar Crater Lake in Buldhana, after it turned pink, owing to a rise in the PH (acidity) and salinity levels of lake water, was reported earlier this month.During a special sitting on Monday, the HC directed four senior lawyers, including senior advocate CS Kaptan (counsel for petitioner Anand Parchure), state pollution control board’s standing counsel Ravi Sanyal and amicus curiae Ashutosh Dharmadhikari, to visit the crater and submit a status report.The state forest department in its report informed that the samples of the lake water were collected with the help of microbiologists and sent to the Pune-based Agarkar Institute and the Nagpur-based National Environmental Engineering and Research Institute (NEERI). The division bench of justice Sunil Shukre and justice Anil Kilor then directed the experts from NEERI to examine the findings on glass surface on the Lonar Crater Lake and submit its report within four weeks. Agarkar Institute was also asked to submit its report.The bench also directed the irrigation department to collect the water from the lake on a regular basis as well as from the nearby dam at the upper level and make it available for an explanation for comparative analysis to arrive at the conclusion.Apart from these bodies, the public works department as well as the Buldhana collector were directed to file a report about the possible alternate site for the Lonar-Kinhi Road passing through the ecologically-sensitive zone. If a possible site cannot be found, the court directed the two authorities to take all necessary precautions.As far as the non-functioning of a nearby sewage water treatment plant and the delay in shifting of 400 tenements and slum dwellers from the area is concerned, the court directed the departments concerned to expeditiously look into the two issues and submit a report on the same. HC directed the police and administration to take necessary action against open defecation with the help of non-governmental organisations (NGOs). The bench also directed PWD to hand over the rest house building in a protected zone to the forest department as early as possible.The shortage of water supply faced by the Lonar Municipal Council and residents owing to the old supply line was also highlighted before the bench and the council was directed to submit a fresh proposal to Maharashtra Jeevan Pradhikaran within the next 10 days.HC in previous instances, based on several petitions, issued a number of directions to sort out all difficulties in protecting the lake. However, owing to the sudden colour change, questions were raised over the steps taken for the preservation, prompting the court to convene the special sitting.The 77.69-hectare lake area is a part of the Lonar sanctuary that expands over 3.66 sqkm. It is famous as the world’s largest basaltic impact crater.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/change-in-colour-of-lonar-lake-bombay-hc-convenes-special-sitting-to-issue-directions-to-authorities/story-N4ytTBe9P4A27MmloAqnjO.html

16-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab and Haryana HC for alternative mechanism to hear cases of runaway couples||The Punjab and Haryana high court has opined that an alternative mechanism should be evolved to hear petitions of runaway couples seeking protection in high courts. The bench of justice RN Raina stated, “I believe it to be the most demeaning childlike-work the high court judges have been forcibly tasked with by a creation of the ingenious bar and a solution needs to be devised to cast the burden on some other alternative mechanism of redress, including by amending the law and conferring such power on the subordinate judiciary etc.” He added that it was just a suggestion and it is for the legislature to find solutions.Even during lockdown period, 30-40 such petitions are being taken up by high court these days. Lawyers say, on an ordinary day, the number of petitions would go beyond 100 cases. A large number of these marriages are performed at religious places in the tricity itself following which protection petitions moved in the high court. It may cost anything between ₹50,000 to 1.5 lakh, a lawyer said. The petitions are filed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which guarantees protection of personal life and liberty.The bench was hearing a petition of a Punjab couple. In fact, the court’s attention had gone to the matter over photographs of ceremonies being attached with the petitions. Now, the court has directed that the practice be done away with. The bench observed that the photographs of the couple do not even show the maulvis, granthis and purohits/pandits etc who performed the “ceremony” and shows just the couple, these days wearing masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-and-haryana-hc-for-alternative-mechanism-to-hear-cases-of-runaway-couples/story-Tp72XdmnZBavU7feAyHIpI.html

16-06-2020||Chandigarh||Soon, artificial intelligence to solve Chandigarh’s traffic woes||In 18 month’s time, artificial intelligence (AI) will be resolving the city’s worsening traffic woes and running a host of public grievance redressal processes.AI and machine learning technology-based adaptive traffic control system (ATCS) will monitor real-time traffic conditions in the city. It will improve the signal timing and help in easing traffic snarls. In the first phase to be completed by December 2021, the system will be installed in 40 junctions across the city.The ATCS is one of the components of the Integrated Command and Control Centre (ICCC). The Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) on Monday signed a contract worth ₹295 crore with Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL) paving the way for the construction of an ICCC Complex, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems for all utility services and Police Command Center (PCCC).KK Yadav, MC commissioner-cum-chief executive officer (CEO) of the CSCL, said, “These command centres shall act as the brain of the city, with an on-premise data centre hosting all relevant solutions for all following field systems, and data analytic tools for informative decision-making, better disaster management and smarter governance.”MORE THAN 1,000 CAMERAS TO BE INSTALLEDICCC will monitor the smart field elements like CCTV surveillance cameras. For real-time surveillance of traffic junctions and other important city buildings like water works, parks, government hospitals, community centers, parking locations, schools etc, more than 1,000 cameras will be installed at 285 locations.The ICCC system will include an advanced video analytic system and will generate automatic event alerts. This will help in real-time surveillance of the city and shall generate alarms for specific incidents on the intelligent traffic management system (ITMS).“The monitoring and issuance of the challans for violations of different traffic offences will go automatic through the AI-based traffic enforcement systems (TES),” said Yadav.TES includes red-light violation detection in the first phase supported at 40 Junctions, speeding violation at 10 locations, automatic number plate recognition at 40 junctions and at the city’s 20 entry and exit points.“This will help in making roads safer and reducing accidents,” said Yadav.IMPROVED PUBLIC ADDRESSING SYSTEMAlso part of the improved traffic management system will be a public addressing system and variable message signs. For communication, city-wide optical fiber cable of around 250 km will be laid.“A host of other services provided by the administration and the MC will be integrated with the SCADA system. A dedicated call centre will also be a part of this project to help residents get real-time information of the services provided under Chandigarh smart city project. Services, too, will be monitored and the data center will collect and analyse their quality and delivery. This will help in better decision-making, and consequently improve customer service,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/soon-artificial-intelligence-to-solve-chandigarh-s-traffic-woes/story-XNkY29n5JJ9DstUzvxwLbP.html

However, no temporary prison has been opened yet.The report also mentioned that jail superintendents have been instructed to purchase additional mobile phones to allow inmates to speak to their families and lawyers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/269-inmates-73-jail-staffers-across-state-prisons-covid-positive-report/story-x5mfIDWtWxyS4R2p44fycK.html

Patil has decided to propose the same in the general body meeting on Tuesday. “The number of Covid-19 cases in Bhiwandi is rapidly increasing, and yet there is no social distancing to curb the spread of the infection. There is a need to have complete lockdown in the city,” said Patil. “In several areas, people are not willing to come forward and get them checked even if they have symptoms. People are not cooperating. A lockdown will help curb the spread in the city,” she added. The mayor will propose this to the general body of BNCMC for discussion and emphasise on implementing it. “Even if the state government has initiated unlock 1.0, local civic bodies can take individual decisions considering the situation in their vicinity,” said Patil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-mayor-to-propose-complete-lockdown-in-bhiwandi/story-nwcRHzCNj3PSmOhgKkac6O.html

16-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Direct airlines to provide cash refund to passengers’||Former chief minister and member of legislative Assembly Prithviraj Chavan and member of Rajya Sabha from the Shiv Sena Anil Desai have written to aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri to clarify the ministry’s stand on passengers who could not fly due to the nationwide lockdown. The letter also seeks Puri to direct airlines to provide a cash refund to passengers who had booked their tickets before March 25 for travel dates during the lockdown. Chavan in his letter dated June 14, requested clarification on refund policies and to direct airlines to prevent abuse of consumer rights and provide a choice of cash refunds with settlement in a specific time period. His letter read, “Indian consumers who had to cancel their flight tickets after announcement of the lockdown are entitled to receive cash refunds.”Citing the Consumer Protection Act, Chavan added, “The contract between the airlines and the consumers gives the right to consumers to seek cash refund. Many airlines, including Air India, are not honouring this contract and are compelling passengers to accept vouchers...not all consumers are willing to accept a voucher for future travel.”On similar lines, Desai in a separate letter dated June 10, stated that passengers who booked their air tickets before March 25 for their travel have not been covered. His letter read, “The idea that air travel is only for the economically well-off is outdated and no longer holds true. Consumers from all strata of society now use air travel and with the imposition of the travel ban have suffered undue hardships for no fault of their own.”Pointing out the directives issued by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) to member states after consumer rights organisation Mumbai Grahak Panchayat (MGP) sought their intervention in bringing about uniform regulations in the issue, Desai asked the government to direct airlines to design voluntary satisfactory voucher schemes for those who are frequent fliers and are not seeking refunds on their cancelled tickets. He also asked the minister to ensure a transparent process for confirmation, cancellation, return and refund of products and services. “The woes of consumers who are excluded from the specified period ought to be addressed by the civil aviation ministry by either refunding the ticket money or by extending the validity of such tickets till resumption of normal commercial flights,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/direct-airlines-to-provide-cash-refund-to-passengers/story-3cqzZRRWaEEoaHAmWBkNhM.html

Idol makers said transporting larger idols will be difficult owing to the lack of enough manpower, as they have not received any directions on how many people will be allowed to gather for the celebrations owing to the coronavirus outbreak. Some members from the association have raised concerns over the non-allotment of space by the civic body to set up their stalls. Until last year, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) would issue permissions three months prior to the festival to sculptors to make Ganpati idols at designated footpaths and other public spaces.“We met the police commissioner and he expressed his concerns over idol makers facing losses this year owing to the lockdown. As of now, we have asked our members to restrict the height of the Ganpati idols. We are also instructing them to make idols of clay so that devotees can carry out immersions at home if outdoor provisions cannot be made owing to the outbreak,” said Gajanan Tondwalkar, president of the association.Tondwalkar added that they got clearance to bring five containers of shadu clay from Gujarat only last week.“Though we have finally got shadu (clay), we don’t have workers nor do we have colours to paint the idols. Also, if the orders come like they did in the past years at the last moment, I doubt if we will be able to meet the demand. All these years, we would make additional idols, but this year due to the lockdown, we have limited number of idols,” said Rupesh Narvekar, who owns Om Morya Chitra Mandal workshop at Chembur. Though they had started making idols for this year’s celebrations, the lockdown has delayed their work. “We now make idols at home as we can’t go to the workshop due to the lockdown. Despite working from home, these idols will not dry soon due to monsoon,” he said. Some communities have decided to even postpone celebrations at their home, but many are keen on holding the celebrations with limited family members.Each year, around 11,000 large idols and 1.6 lakh household idols are made in the city using Plaster of Paris (PoP), while 75 large idols and 40,000 household idols are made from clay. Around 250 paper idols are made for the 11-day festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/limit-height-of-ganesh-idols-for-mandals-to-5ft-city-association-tells-sculptors/story-HtGR5iZEaB7tr2b5sBfl5I.html

The Enforcement Directorate has now been asked to submit its reply on their plea by June 20.The Wadhawans were arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in connection with the YES bank fraud case on May 14. The agency initiated proceedings against the Wadhawans based on a first information report (FIR) registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on March 7 against the two brothers as well as the bank’s promoter Rana Kapoor.As per ED’s allegations, YES Bank had invested ₹3,700 crore in DHFL’s short-term non-convertible debentures between April and June 2018, for which Kapoor had received kickbacks worth ₹600 crore as loans to DoIT Urban Ventures (India) Private Limited. Kapoor’s daughters hold 100℅ stake in DoIT Urban Ventures Private Limited.The two brothers have in their bail plea questioned the allegation of payment of kickbacks given to Kapoor. They have said that no other ‘defaulter’ has been arrested by the agency. The Wadhaans in their plea have claimed that their company is now under a court-appointed administrator and hence, there is no question of them tempering with any evidence related to the company records, if they are granted bail.The court has now asked ED to submit its reply on the brothers’ bail plea and scheduled the hearing for June 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/yes-bank-fraud-wadhawans-seek-bail-on-merits-of-the-case/story-F2tGZXXYgMeFJ9ZybtW3aJ.html
16-06-2020||Mumbai||Feels different, but much safer, say commuters on train services||There was none of the chaos and thundering of a thousand feet on the platforms, when Mumbai’s local trains restarted operations on Monday. There was something like the usual chaos outside the railway stations, though.People with e-passes that let them drive around during the lockdown, thought they could finally hop on a train and go to their workshop / cousin’s house / check on their business (they couldn’t). Others with bank employee IDs headed there hoping to finally cut commute times. They weren’t allowed in either.While communication had been sketchy, security was airtight. You only got as far as a booking counter if you had a special railway e-pass or an ID that identified you as a specific kind of essential worker — state or civic employee; doctor, hospital or BEST staff; police personnel.On the platforms, it was another world. There was an eerie silence as everyone waited, masked and gloved, in ones. Then filed in quietly and were guided through the new seating norms — one person per berth; no more than 700 on a 12-car rake that usually carried over 5,000.Those leaving the station after a train ride were still elated. “I got on a train after three months and I’ve never experienced anything like this, but what a relief,” said Vaibhav Wadenkar, 29, a health department employee who lives in Andheri and works at Virar. “I’ve been taking buses all these days. The train has saved me one hour today already.”Shivaji Sade, 50, who lives at Amboli and works at Nair hospital in Mumbai Central, said the commute felt safer too. “There’s more distance between people here than on the buses. The compartments have been cleaned, railway staff are checking your temperature and ID. I felt safe.”For some, the whole thing felt more surreal than they’d expected. “The route is the same, the trains are the same, but everything felt different,” said Dr Virendra Yadav, 28, a general practitioner headed from his clinic in Dahisar to his home in Jogeshwari. “I hope they keep the numbers like this though. Because if the crowd grows, the risk of the virus spreading is too frightening to think about.”The constables stationed at every railway station would agree. Even with Monday’s stringent rules, the numbers took some handling. “People are constantly coming to us and asking whether they can take a train, when they can take a train. A lot of bank employees were insisting they be allowed in. But we have our orders and our lists. We hope things will be clearer in the future,” said a policeman who’d been on duty since 5.30 am, outside Andheri station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/feels-different-but-much-safer-say-commuters-on-train-services/story-H4kTr4ozrHInYS89MZcnXL.html

As a precautionary measure police personnel have also been asked to take hot water steam before coming to police station to ensure they have clear respiratory track.(With inputs from Vijay Kumar Yadav)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/three-constables-succumb-to-covid-19-on-monday/story-Pad2eWElQExKDppM9oLJJI.html
16-06-2020||Chandigarh||Unavailability of food, medicines worries the elderly in Chandigarh||On World Elder Abuse Awareness Day, which was observed on Monday, many senior citizens in Chandigarh pointed to a new kind of abuse — difficulty in getting supplies and medicines amid the Covid-19 lockdown.As per the 2011 census, of the 11.3 lakh population of Chandigarh, there were 83,952 senior citizens in the city and as per the 2019 Lok Sabha registered voters list, seniors formed 7.4% of the city’s population.As per president of Second Innings Association RK Garg, many seniors who lived alone couldn’t walk to the market to get supplies. “We had to look after seniors with Alzheimer’s who didn’t even know about the lockdown. Families being locked together led to arguments and many times we had to intervene,” he said.Gurnam Singh, a member of Chandigarh Senior Citizens Association (CSCA), who coordinates with the UT administration regarding cases of elder abuse said no cases of abuse had come up during the lockdown. Former president of CSCA Brig (retd) Keshav Chandra added that the stigma attached with Covid had kept many seniors from seeking help even if they were suffering from Covid symptoms.Vice-president of the Senior Citizen Welfare Association of Modern Housing Complex, Sector 13, Manimajra, SC Luthra said they helped arrange medicines for seniors living alone and those undergoing dialysis were taken to the hospital.Speaking about the administration’s role in helping seniors during the lockdown, UT social welfare secretary Yashpal Garg said, “For seniors living at the old age homes in Sector 15 and Sector 43, we had identified two separate rooms for Covid screening and provided them ration for two months so the premises could be sealed. Nobody from the outside was allowed to enter the premises,” he said, adding that the 1090 helpline for senior citizens was also working to assist seniors.Deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Charanjit Singh Virk said, “The police had reached out to hundreds of senior citizens living alone in the city through the police control room. We would call the seniors and ask them about their well-being. We would also supply groceries and medicines to them if needed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/unavailability-of-food-medicines-worries-the-elderly-in-chandigarh/story-jnQ5AMuIyQhBN605o7x6pJ.html
16-06-2020||Mumbai||Cyclone Nisarga: Central team set to survey losses||Amid a visit by the Central team, the state government is expected to soon submit a memorandum to the Centre for relief for the Cyclone Nisarga-hit coastal districts, including Raigad and Ratnagiri.Agriculture and horticulture crops on more than 30,000 hectares have been damaged in Raigad and Ratnagiri, where spot assessment is still being carried out.The Central team, led by joint secretary and advisor of National Disaster Management Authority Ramesh Kumar Ganta, comprises five other senior bureaucrats from various other departments. The team arrived in Mumbai on Monday evening and will visit Chaul, Diveagar and Kashid in Raigad on Tuesday and seven villages in Mandangad and Dapoli tehsils of Ratnagiri on Wednesday. They will hold meetings with district collectors during their visits. After its study, the team will submit its report to the Centre.Officials of the relief and rehabilitation department, which has prepared the memorandum, is expected to meet the Central team on Thursday. “We have prepared a memorandum for Central assistance. The final data on losses to crops, houses and livestock is yet to be accumulated. During our meeting, we may submit preliminary estimates,” said an official from the department.According to the preliminary estimates, in Raigad alone, 1.63 lakh houses have sustained damage, of which 3,120 pucca-kutcha houses have completely collapsed. Perennial crops, including mangoes, chikoos, betel nuts, on more than 22,000 hectares have been destroyed. In Ratnagiri, horticulture crop on 5,500 hectares and 40,000 houses have been damaged.Government structures, including schools and primary health centres, too, have collapsed. Electricity connectivity in hundreds of villages in Raigad is still disrupted. The Raigad district collectorate said that 85% of connections affected in cyclone have been restored. Raigad district collector Nidhi Chaudhari said, “We restored mobile connectivity in 24 hours and road connectivity in 72 hours. About 2 lakh of 6.5 lakh people are still without electricity, but it will be restored soon. More than 2 lakh trees have fallen and actual losses are worth more than ₹450 crore. Spot assessment of the damages to the houses and crop losses is expected to be completed now.” The state has already announced ₹100-crore relief for Raigad, ₹75 crore for Ratnagiri and ₹25 crore for Sindhudurg for repair of houses and infrastructure. The state has also tweaked the existing norms for the ex-gratia for losses to crops and houses. The ex-gratia for losses to trees has been increased to ₹50,000 from ₹18,000 per hectare, while the relief for partial loss of the houses has been increased to ₹15,000 from ₹6,000 and ₹1.5 lakh for fully damaged houses from earlier norms of ₹95,100.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cyclone-nisarga-central-team-set-to-survey-losses/story-i4FGRwif0LRTyG0ia6U7YN.html
16-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai airport to add 50 more flights from Tuesday||Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) will be handling 50 more flights from Tuesday, taking the total number of flights handled each day to 100. The airport commenced its flight operations from May 25 with 25 departures and arrivals each as per restrictions from the state government. The airport operator, Mumbai International Airport Ltd (MIAL), said, “Starting June 16, the airport is permitted to cater to a total of 100 domestic commercial passenger flight movements which includes 50 departures and 50 arrivals.” Unlike other airports, the city airport was seeing 25 departure and 25 arrival flights as the state government had not permitted more flights to operate to and from the city. This was done as a precautionary step to avoid spread of Covid-19 to and from other states. The 25 departure flights mostly operated to places like Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru, Varanasi, Kochi, Gorakhpur, Jaipur, Patna and Hyderabad. “The move will see an increase in the sectors that we are currently handling. We are glad about the new progress that has come in favour of CSMIA, and we continue to relentlessly work towards ensuring the safety of our passengers and smooth functioning at the airport,” a MIAL spokesperson said. “The airport operator has alerted all the airlines about the development and a revised schedule of flights that will be operated on Tuesday will be made. This relaxation in the restriction is a big relief to all the stranded passengers who have not been able to fly back,” said an airport source.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-airport-to-add-50-more-flights-from-tuesday/story-dnYagH8TwtDVhNYDjXJnhK.html
16-06-2020||City||Man cheats over 2,500 women of ₹7.74 lakh, held||Manor police on Monday arrested a man for cheating 2,580 widows in Palghar taluka of ₹7.74 lakh. The accused Rahul Vadu, 25, from Kurje Dagdipada, promised them ₹40,000 each to start small businesses. Vadu would tell the women that he worked for a reputed charitable organisation, and asked them to pay ₹300 as ‘application fee’. The accused worked as a housekeeper in a city-based hospital.Vadu had quit the job in October 2019 and decided to cheat the widows, said assistant inspector Pratap Darade of Manor police station. He formed a 11- member team who fanned in the hamlets to lure victims. Vadu would tell the women to make a ₹300 demand draft as ‘application fee’ and in return they would get ₹40,000 as startup funds to start small businesses. He put up banners of the organisation all over Jawhar, Vikramgadh and other areas to win confidence of the victims, said Darade. He would also assure that the organisation will also construct roads, provide electricity, drinking water and would show slides of the projects undertaken, said Darade.One of the victim, Rajshri Tandel complained to police as Vadu did not return her Aadhar card, bank passbook, her husband’s death certificate, ration card and other documents.“We have arrested Vadu and booked him for cheating and impersonation and other allied sections of the Indian Penal Code,” said Darade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-cheats-over-2-500-women-of-7-74-lakh-held/story-nqtViqY7oVlUkXyBlvz9XP.html
16-06-2020||Mumbai||Final-year students’ job prospects likely to be hit||The Covid-19 lockdown has not only affected the regular academic calendar but also many graduating students are now facing delay in job prospects. The situation is, especially, stark for final year students who are currently unclear about the status of their examinations. In many cases, companies have already started online training of new entrants, while in other cases, companies have delayed their hiring process by a month or two, hoping their final year is cleared and normalcy in daily life is restored. “Some companies are currently in the process of getting graduates on board for training as well as other online exercises, whereas some companies have delayed joining dates to September and October,” said Nainesh Koli, placement coordinator of NM College, Vile Parle. He added that in some cases, colleges are in talks with recruiters to find a feasible solution to the ongoing problem to ensure students don’t lose job and training opportunities.Several higher educational institutes, including the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs), were worried about companies, especially international recruiters, pulling out of their deals made during campus placements in Mumbai. Most technical institutes were, however, surprised to see recruiters reaching out to colleges to hire, even when the city was grappling with the second and third phases of lockdown. In many cases, colleges were holding Skype interviews for their final year students with interested companies in April and May 2020 as well.“Many IT companies have allowed students to join them with a mutual understanding that students will be relieved if and when their examinations are scheduled. While other companies are ready to hold their end of the deal for a couple of months and let students join them by August. We are trying our best to ensure our students are not at a loss,” said the spokesperson of a city-based engineering institute.The deal, says many principals, depends on how long the partial lockdown will be extended and the status of the virus spread by the end of this month. “While some companies are agreeing to defer joining dates for the recruited staff, we worry that even after lockdown ends, if the state insists on examination, that process will take another month or two, and that could be a problem with the investment and banking or consulting companies based out of the United States and Europe. The government should understand the plight of final year students,” said Gopakumaran Thampi principal, Thadomal Shahani Engineering College, Bandra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/final-year-students-job-prospects-likely-to-be-hit/story-VjafYW8meCDxfvhwUNTAMK.html
16-06-2020||Mumbai||City’s lifeline back on slow, wary track||After 84 days of lockdown, local trains in the city began operations for essential workers on Monday. The first train operated at 4.03am, between Panvel and Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT). Distancing norms were observed and passengers were screened before boarding trains. Train services for the general public remain suspended.Late on Sunday night, the railways had issued a notification allowing Central (CR) and Western Railway (WR) to resume select suburban train services for essential staff, as identified by the state government. On Monday, approximately 60,000 passengers travelled by local trains, according to CR and WR. The state government and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) submitted a list of who would travel from their respective stations to the railways. Nearly 40 thousand railway tickets were sold on Monday.To board trains, passengers had to undergo thermal screening and show their identity cards. Entry and exit points at stations have been limited and are being manned by Railway Protection Force (RPF), Government Railway Police (GRP), Mumbai Police personnel and railway ticketing staff.A total of 700 passengers were allowed on board each train, with approximately 58 passengers inside each compartment. “The number of passengers boarding from the railway stations was received from state government and BMC. Employees were asked to report early. The timings of local trains have also been coordinated with office shift timings,” said a senior CR official.There was some confusion regarding which essential services qualified for train travel. Those working in the banking sector, media and postal services were not allowed to enter railway stations. “I work for a bank in Andheri and was not allowed to travel by local train. As I reached the railway station and showed my identity card, the police personnel told me that I’m not permitted to travel,” said Dominic Rebello, a Virar resident.On Monday afternoon, WR’s divisional railway manager (DRM) clarified on Twitter that train services were running for BMC, the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking, Mumbai Police personnel as well as those working at Mantralaya and in government and private hospitals.For commuters, the experience was different from their pre-pandemic experiences on local trains. “The journey was nostalgic and very overwhelming. I have never seen trains this empty. There was strict scrutinising of passengers outside railway stations,” said Ghatkopar resident Anjana Choudhury.The expected estimate of essential service employees who would commute by local train is approximately 1.25 lakh. Officials expect more commuters to use the train today. “Limited number of people were aware of local train services restarting on Monday as the approval came in late at night. Scrutinising, screening of passengers and maintaining social distancing could be a challenge from Tuesday,” said a senior railway official.The railways have asked BMC to issue e-passes with QR codes to essential service employees. E-passes will be issued by BMC in coordination with Mumbai Police’s IT cell.BMC has been appointed the nodal authority to draw up lists of essential workers from BMC, BEST, Mantralaya and private hospitals. Other agencies, including Mumbai Police, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), and Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation, will supply details of their employees directly to the railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-s-lifeline-back-on-slow-wary-track/story-VpPU2AHWH0nmS3uggXwwsK.html
16-06-2020||City||Train services reduce travel time for essential workers||Central Railway (CR) has resumed around 130 services along the Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus to Kasara, Karjat, Kalyan or Thane route for those identified by the state government as essential workers. These trains halt at major stations and the train timings have been scheduled to match working hours. For commuters like Vilas Shankar Dattatray, 52, who travels daily from his home in Kalyan to his office in Ghatkopar, this came as a great relief. “For the past week, I have been struggling to get to work, the long queue and the traffic would lead to three hours of travelling one way. Today, thanks to the railway, I managed to reach Ghatkopar station within 45 minutes,” said Dattatray, who is a state government employee.Commuters who travelled on Monday said processes worked smoothly at the stations. “All entry and exit points at stations were sealed and only one common entrance was kept open. At various spots, police and ticket checking staff were deployed to ensure smooth functioning. Only limited people were allowed on trains, ensuring distancing,” said Kalyan resident Deepak Dubey.However, the queues and crowds at bus stops continues to be large. “The frequency of buses was fewer than other days, which led to longer queues at bus stops. Although train services have resumed, they are only for government employees and essential services. Private sector employees continue to travel by bus. We need more services and a proper system in place at bus stops as well,” Ditya Chachad, 26, who has to travel from Dombivli to Churchgate.Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation said its buses made between 400 to 600 trips between Mantralaya and places like Thane, Kalyan and Badlapur. “Depending on the number of drivers we have each day, we provide trips on this route. This is the reason why on some days we have fewer trips and the frequency of buses decreases, keeping everyone waiting for longer. But we adjust by ensuring that in the morning hours there are more buses plying towards Mantralaya and in the evening towards Badlapur,” said an officer from MSRTC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/train-services-reduce-travel-time-for-essential-workers/story-F1rFkRFG6pkKwORDfCbX3O.html
16-06-2020||Mumbai||Civic body has not listed 950 deaths, alleges Fadnavis||Former chief minister and leader of the Opposition Devendra Fadnavis in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday alleged the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had allegedly not registered as many as 950 deaths caused due to the pandemic as Covid-19 deaths.Until Sunday, the city had recorded 2,182 deaths due to Covid-19 with fatality rate of 3.7%. Covid-19 fatality rate has increased from 3.2% on June 1 to 3.7% on June 12.Fadnavis, who released the letter to the media and also tweeted about it, said the death audit committee set up by BMC had declared 451 deaths caused by the disease as non-Covid ones. The committee has been formed to scrutinise all such deaths before those are officially recorded as Covid-19 deaths.“All these deaths were caused by coronavirus as per Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) norms. Under whose pressure did the audit committee not show these deaths as due to Covid-19? Will the state government take action against the committee? Now after this has come to light, the government has belatedly asked BMC to update the data,” read the letter.Fadnavis claimed that of these 451 deaths, 356 deaths were declared non-Covid while the remaining were pending for scrutiny. He further alleged there are another 500-odd deaths that took place in private hospitals due to Covid-19 but were not referred to this committee at all. “Both of these instances are extremely serious in nature and criminal in intent,” said Fadnavis.There was no official reaction from the BMC on Fadnavis’ allegations. A senior civic official said, “There could be a pendency of cases before the committee, but there is no pressure or any attempt being made to stifle Covid-19 death numbers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/civic-body-has-not-listed-950-deaths-alleges-fadnavis/story-ZtQ2zIIiTFzCfT3fQrm6AL.html
16-06-2020||Noida||Covid-19: Noida sector 94 cremation ground being sanitized daily||In the wake of Covid-19 pandemic, the Noida authority is conducting regular sanitisation drives at the cremation ground in Sector 94, officials said Monday. According to the NGO, Noida Lok Manch (NLM), which maintains the cremation ground, on average 300 bodies are cremated a month during the lockdown. “The Noida authority sanitizes the ground daily with sodium hypochlorite solution to keep it virus free. And we are disinfecting the facility daily on our own too to ensure that people visiting the cremation ground do not face any infection risk,” said Mahesh Saxena, general secretary, NLM.The cremation ground located near Kalindi Kunj Barrage on Yamuna is spread over 13 acres along the embankment road.In view of the Covid-19 crisis, one of the two CNG chambers that was not working earlier has been repaired, said the NGO.“As of now, there is no waiting time or pressure on us because the facility has the capacity to cremate at least 30 bodies daily. We can cremate 12 bodies with the help of wood and the remaining in the two CNG chambers,” said Saxena.For the cremation of a Covid-19 positive body, the staff use personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow the protocols of the health department, said an employee at the facility. There are 27 staff members, including four gardeners, at the facility to take care of the operations.“We have recently got 200 PPE kits, apart from the 50 kits we already had with us. We use a PPE kit once and then dispose of it scientifically. If we cremate more than one body at a time, then the PPE kit is disposed of once our work is over,” Saxena said.Noida authority officials confirmed that they are disinfecting the cremation ground on a daily basis.“Apart from this, we also take care of the sanitation work at the cremation ground,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-sector-94-cremation-ground-being-sanitized-daily/story-r4TJmJP0dn4Lh91M8D7zhO.html

Of the last 15 days, Maharashtra has recorded over 100 deaths, except on June 1 and June 7, when 76 and 91 fatalities were recorded, respectively.The health department official said that the number of fatalities seems high in the daily reports due to reconciliation. The percentage of fatalities has remained the same as the number of cases, but the absolute number of deaths has seen a rise in the last fortnight, said Anup Kumar Yadav, state health commissioner.Yadav said the department is expecting that the fatalities would reduce in the coming days as they have strengthened the health infrastructure and are focusing on “bed management”.“The mortality rate is almost the same as it is earlier. The absolute number of deaths has increased therefore it is reflecting higher. By and large, the composition of fatalities remains the same — comorbidities, people arriving late for treatment and the virus manifesting in a different kind of conditions. Comorbidities in the higher age segment is the main reason. Now it [the fatalities] should gradually come down. We have prepared our infrastructure in terms of dedicated facilities, ICU beds, ventilators; we have got more manpower, including doctors and nurses. We are focusing on bed management; aiming to provide a bed to anyone who has any symptomatic condition, we can control the fatalities through this.”Of the fatalities recorded on Monday, 69.34% of the people had comorbidities, including diabetes, high blood pressure, heart diseases, etc. Of them, 91 people were over age of 60, 74 people were between 40 and 59 years, the data provided by the public health department stated.The state government is expecting cases to rise in the next 15-20 days and the state would see a peak in Covid-19 cases by early next month. Officials said that they had anticipated the rise and have prepared for it.A senior health department official said, “After the lockdown has been relaxed in Mumbai and Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) cases here have increased. It was expected to. The last five days before Monday consecutively saw over 3,000 new cases in the state. We are preparing that the ‘unlock’ (referring to relaxation in lockdown) doesn’t make ouR battle too steep.”Yadav added that with the movement of people, a complete redistribution of cases will begin. “The virus is following its natural course. With the increased movement of people after [lifting restrictions], it is only going up. A complete redistribution of cases is happening. It is expected to go on for about a month after which it will settle down. We will see a peak by July.”Meanwhile, 5,79,158 people are under home quarantine, while 28,084 are at institutional quarantine facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-covid-toll-crosses-4-000-recoveries-exceed-active-cases/story-JoJslkbqAWyYIr5QOmQxvO.html
16-06-2020||City||Nodal officers want Ghaziabad to focus on reducing Covid-19 deaths||The nodal officers appointed by the state to oversee the Covid-19 containment measures in Ghaziabad district have asked the district officials to focus on bringing down the death rate of Covid-19 infections which is on the rise since June 1. The nodal officers have been assigned by the chief minister to 11 districts, including Ghaziabad, which have a high incidence of Covid-19 cases.According to official records, till June 14, Ghaziabad has a total of 625 cases, of which 320 have been recorded since June 1. Of the total 22 deaths due to Covid-19, 18 were in the month of June.As a result, the death rate in Ghaziabad stands at 3.52%, which is higher than the state average of 2.93% (till June 14). During a meeting on Monday, the two nodal officers for Ghaziabad -- Senthil Pandian C chairman of the power utility board and Dr Anil Chandra, professor of neurosurgery from King George’s Medical University, Lucknow -- directed the Ghaziabad officials to come up with a strategy to reduce deaths due to Covid-19.“The officials have asked us to undertake a detailed investigation of every death case and provide a detailed report on each such case. This is to help have a better understanding of case and disease management in the future. Further, L1 category Covid hospitals (those treating non-critical patients) are overburdened. Around six patients from a L1 hospital were directly referred to L3 hospitals (facility for critical cases) after their condition deteriorated.They should have been referred to L2 hospitals ( for serious cases),” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO), Ghaziabad, said.The officials said treatment imparted at L1 hospitals needs to be improved. Of the 22 deaths reported from Ghaziabad, nine have taken place at Ghaziabad hospitals, while 11 others died in Meerut and one each in Noida and Delhi.The officials also discussed the rising number of cases. About 246 of the 625 cases reported so far have links to Delhi. “There are 246 cases which are related to patients who have travelled to Delhi or have acquired the infection while undergoing treatment in Delhi. The figure also includes close contacts of such patients. The officials have told us that we need to have 4,000 Covid beds ready in order to deal with the rising number of cases,” CMO added.The Ghaziabad officials said they would require about 1,300 additional health care professionals, including 240 doctors, 360 staff nurses and about 350 ward staff and an equal number of cleaning staff. The proposal for 4,000 new Covid beds has been chalked out and 13 colleges in the district have been identified where these beds can be set up.Despite the rising number of Covid-19 cases and deaths, the Ghaziabad district has a good recovery rate with 40% patients recovering in March, 66.66% by the end of April and 76.39% till the end of May. The overall recovery rate at present is 62.72% (till June 14).Apart from Ghaziabad, nodal officers have been appointed to Gautam Budh Nagar, Meerut, Agra, Firozabad, Kanpur City, Aligarh, Moradabad, Bulandshahr, Jhansi and Basti districts.“The officers have been issued detailed instructions. They will conduct inspections for better management of hospitals, equipment such as ventilators, oxygen cylinders and PPE kits, besides reviewing cases, implementation of infection prevention protocols and a review of L1, L2 and L3 Covid hospitals,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nodal-officers-want-ghaziabad-to-focus-on-reducing-covid-19-deaths/story-7IBE1RSQznsKqASjpzxwyO.html

16-06-2020||City||Rumours of another lockdown trigger rush back to home towns||Rumours that the government might implement another lockdown, to contain the rise in Covid-19 cases in Delhi-NCR, led to a rush for seats on Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) buses in the second week of June. According to data maintained by the UPSRTC for the Ghaziabad region, state-run buses ferried at least 1,45,201 passengers out of the district between June 8 and June 14, as compared to 53, 247 passengers ferried between June 1 and June 7 from Ghaziabad to various towns in the state.“In the past week (June 8 to June 14), there has been a sudden increase in the number of passengers travelling on UPSRTC buses from the Ghaziabad region. When we spoke to some of the passengers, they told us that they are heading home as there could be another lockdown in the region soon. During the past week, thousands of people have reached the bus terminal in Kaushambi and boarded buses to their home towns in Uttar Pradesh,” AK Singh, regional manager, UPSRTC, said. The Central government has recently refuted some social media posts hat a lockdown would be imposed in Delhi-NCR again from June 18, while Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday categorically said there will not eb another lockdown. “Many people are speculating whether another lockdown is being planned in Delhi. There are no such plans,” Kejriwal tweeted.As many migrant workers wanted to return home, the UPSRTC had to be rope in more buses to accommodate the rise in number of passengers, officials said. While over 2,444 trips were made from June 1 to June 7, the number more than doubled a week later with 5,115 trips being made between June 8 and June 14.“There were a lot of talk in my neighbourhood about another lockdown, and I did not want to get stranded the way I was during the first lockdown. When I tried to go back home during the first lockdown, there was a heavy rush at the bus terminal and I could not leave. So I am heading home now,” said Mahipal, a 42-year-old garment factory worker. Mahipal, who lives in Loni, was at Kaushambhi bus terminal and was heading to his home town Bareilly on Monday afternoon.The first nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25 to check the spread of Covid-19, and was extended four times with considerable relaxations made in the last two phases. Currently, the lockdown is only effective in containment zones until June 30.Shakeel Ahmad, a daily wager who works at Muzaffarabad in Delhi, was also at Kaushambhi terminal looking for a bus to his home town Mahoba. “The first lockdown was announced all of a sudden, and I could not go home. Now when news about another lockdown is doing the rounds, I am heading home. I will try to return when the situation becomes normal,” he added.Of the total 7,559 departures made by state-run buses between June 1 and June 14, a large number of passengers boarded buses from the Kaushambi terminal. The terminal accounted for 4,480 bus departures which ferried at least 14, 1396 passengers of the total 198,448 travellers, according to the corporation’s data.For the past one week, Kaushambi terminal has been packed with passengers with many private bus operators also trying to get long-distance travellers. “Besides hundreds of UPSRTC buses at Kaushambi, many private buses were parked in our township lanes. They were regularly ferrying passengers to their home towns. We had to seek help from the local police, and no private buse was seen on the internal lanes on Monday,” said VK Mittal, president, Kaushambi Apartments’ RWA (residents’ welfare association).The Kaushambi terminal, opposite to Delhi’s Anand Vihar, had witnessed a large outpour of migrant workers since the first lockdown was announced. The UPSRTC officials said after Centre’s announcement refuting rumours, they are expecting the number of passengers to go down. “To cater to the rising number of passengers over the past week, we had deployed more buses. We now believe that there will be a decline in passengers numbers in the coming days,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rumours-of-another-lockdown-trigger-rush-back-to-home-towns/story-Hked99x2Hbg8KSC6gXehiJ.html
16-06-2020||City||20% surge in sale of foreign liquor in Noida after shops reopen on May 4, beer sales drop||Noida: The city consumed more liquor after the model shops were reopened last month on May 4, with the excise department recording a 20% hike in foreign liquor sales in the month of May 2020 as compare to the same period last year.Officials said liquor worth ₹64.31 crore was sold in May 2020 as compared to ₹62.77 crore sold during the month of May in 2019, which works out to a 2.45% hike in the overall sales. The department officials said the profit came despite a 40% drop in the sale of beer and an 8% drop in the sale of county liquor. Model shops were shut on March 25 in the wake of nationwide lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic. They were reopened on May 4, with restrictive timings (which were extended to June as well) and limited stock, even as most shops remained closed as they were located in containment zone (area from where Covid-19 cases were reported).“More revenue was generated in May even as the sale of beer and country liquor fell. That was because the sale of foreign liquor surged by 20% and made up for the low sale of from beer and country liquor,” RB Singh, district excise officer, Gautam Budh Nagar, said.“There is no clear reason as to why there was a spurt in the sale of foreign liquor,” Singh said.However liquor vend owners believe that the spike in foreign liquor sales was mainly due to the availability fact or -- since stocks of Indian-made foreign liquor and beer were low, people had no option but to buy the more expensive foreign liquor brands.“We are seeing more customers from Noida and Greater Noida buying foreign liquor as compared to earlier months. These people earlier used to purchase liquor from Delhi. However, with the lockdown and sealed borders, residents started buying from the local shops,” Ashok Yadav, a liquor shop owner in Greater Noida, said.Officials attributed the reduction in the customer base of beer to bars, colleges and IT companies remaining closed due to the pandemic. They said there were no directions from the state government as yet on the opening of bars.“A number of migrant labourers also went back home, and they are the major customers for country liquor,” Singh said. Of total ₹64.31 crore generated, ₹16.34 crore was generated in May through the sale of county liquor.Meanwhile, the excise department expects sale to pickup once more as adequate stock have reached liquor vends and more shops are reopening in the city.“The total number of liquor shops in the district is 520 and of this, 22 are in containment zones and thus closed while rest are all functional,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/20-surge-in-sale-of-foreign-liquor-in-noida-after-shops-reopen-on-may-4-beer-sales-drop/story-3ge8HW2GRHjNEhAn4jSvNP.html
16-06-2020||Noida||Peak-hour traffic snarls continue as Noida Police monitors both entry and exit of vehicles||Commuters travelling between Noida and Delhi continued to face traffic congestion during peak hours on Monday as the district police started monitoring both exit and entry of vehicles from and to the city.Noida Police from Saturday had started checking both entry and exit points to the city to better regulate the flow of the traffic and prevent the entry of those who do not have the necessary permission to travel. However, several commuters complained of traffic congestion, especially between 9.30am to 11am and 5pm to 7pm. “It took me more than two hours to travel from Noida to Daryaganj via DND flyway. We started around 10am and reached our destination at around 12.30 pm. Earlier, there used to be checking by Noida Police while entering the city. Now they are monitoring even while exiting the city,” said Rishi Oswal, a resident of Delhi, who owns a showroom in Sector 18 in Noida. Gautam Budh Nagar had sealed its border with Delhi in early April to avoid the spread of Covid-19 in the city. According to the data released by the district health department on June 1, at least 42% of the cases in the district have been traced to sources in Delhi. As such, the district administration continues to maintain status quo on the issues of sealing of borders with Delhi. In an order passed on May 31, the district administration had clarified that the border will continue to remain sealed until further orders. Delhi, on the other hand, had not initially sealed its border. However, on June 2, the national Capital closed its border, only to remove restrictions within a week. Police officials claimed that the traffic volume has been lower ever since the monitoring of vehicles has started. “There was slightly less traffic on Monday. People who did not have the requisite passes or were not essential services providers were asked to turn around. This has helped to ease the traffic entering Noida. The movement of the traffic only slowed down during the peak hours. We are, however, unable to comment on how long will the sealing of the border with Delhi continue,” said Sankalp Sharma, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-1. Some commuters, however, welcomed the decision of monitoring vehicles on both sides, given the rising number of cases in Noida.“The border should continue to remain sealed. The number of Covid-19 cases in Noida is relatively lower compared to Delhi. If interstate movement is stopped, the situation will be easier to handle,” said NP Singh, a resident of Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/peak-hour-traffic-snarls-continue-as-noida-police-monitors-both-entry-and-exit-of-vehicles/story-lN5cTOWHcaTjvHPJGkCg6J.html

Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“We have formed a Covid task force that will help those who seek medical help as many feel that visiting a doctor or hospital is not safe in these times. So, we arrange a doctor on video call and try to help the patients comfortably at home. If the doctor suggests a Covid-19 test, then further help can be sought from the district administration,” said Rajiva Singh, president of Stellar Kings Court AOA.The Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA), an umbrella body of about 70 housing societies’ apartment owners associations, has suggested other societies to arrange doctors for residents and also for domestic helps, security guards, drivers and others.“Many residents who suffer from a normal fever, cough, pain or other symptoms might feel they have Covid-19. In such a case, a doctor on video call can provide the right advice,” said Singh, who is also president of NOFAA. In some housing societies like Prateek Wisteria in Sector 77, doctors are providing free medical advice to domestic helps.“We have tied up with a doctor who lives in our society to help those who need medical help. He suggests medicines via video call to patients. He charges them a reasonable fee but provides free medical assistance to domestic helps,” said Amit Gupta, president of Prateek Wisteria AOA. The Gautam Budh Nagar administration said it is happy that the apartment owners are making efforts to arrange doctors for residents and others.“Although we appreciate the sentiments, we want to assure them that our bed availability is sufficient to cater to their needs. We have more than three times the number of beds required for active Covid-19 patients in the district. We are in touch with RWAs regularly and their feedback is routinely sought,” said Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-residents-bodies-arrange-doctors-via-video-call-for-medical-advice/story-xd0NUBsuAmhGMxr10ZFFNN.html
16-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi sees a dip after recording over 2k cases three days in a row||Delhi saw a dip in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases after recording over 2,000 a day for three days in a row. The city reported 1,647 new cases on Monday, taking the total number of cases to date to 42,829.Delhi recorded 73 deaths due to Covid-19 on Monday, taking the city’s total toll to 1,400, according to data provided by the Delhi government in its daily bulletin. This puts Delhi’s case fatality rate at 3.2%.The number of active cases—or those still living with the infection—rose to 25,002 on Monday. Of these, there are 5,420 patients with severe symptoms, such as elevated respiratory rate of 30 or more (the normal is 12 to 20 breaths per minute) or oxygen saturation below 90% (the normal is 95% to 100%) admitted to hospitals.The Delhi government data shows that 794 patients, or 3.17% of active cases, continue to be in the intensive care unit. Of these, 197 patients, or almost 0.8%, need ventilator support.The Delhi government plans to augment its ventilator strength by 500 in the coming month, of which 200 ventilators are being provided by the centre. The government estimates the need for 1.5 lakh hospital beds by July-end.Currently, 18,215 people are in home isolation—this accounts for almost 73% of those living with the infection.With several laboratories in the city resuming testing for Covid-19, the number of tests a day has gone up in Delhi over the last two days, with 7,353 samples being tested as per June 14 data and 6,105 as per June 15 data. Last week, on average, 4,900 samples were being tested daily.With the increase in the number of samples, the positivity rate has also started coming down. The positivity rate— or percentage of people who tested positive among those tested—stood at almost 27% on Monday. The highest positivity rate of almost 37% was recorded on June 13 when 2,134 people among the 5,776 tested turned out to be positive.“This just means that currently the numbers are on a rising trend and there is transmission happening in the community. There is no other way that the city could record so many cases every day. However, the increasing positivity rate could also be a result of the labs testing only those with symptoms. If you test only the people who are likely to have the infection, the positivity rate will, of course, be high,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Mohalla Clinic doctor diesA doctor working in a mohalla clinic in Najafgarh, Dr UC Ghosh, died of Covid-19 on Monday. He was 65.He had started working at the clinic just three months back, after his wife died of cancer in March this year. “He was lonely and depressed after his wife died. He had given up his practice to take care of his wife. The clinic came as a welcome respite to him. But, he was likely infected there,” Dr BK Dey, 65, his family friend, who works in Maharshi Valmiki hospital, said.Dr Ghosh was diabetic and hypertensive, according to a Delhi government official.“We have asked our senior doctors to not reopen the clinic as of now. However, there are still several volunteers who want to work there,” the official said.According to his friend, Dr Ghosh started losing his sense of taste and smell about 12 days ago and also felt lethargic. “He would come home from the clinic and just go to bed. His daughter did not think too much of it, but maybe that’s when he got the infection,” Dey said.Dr Ghosh started vomiting and developed a high-grade fever four days ago and had to be admitted to a hospital in Dwarka, where he lives. “He was admitted to the ICU and was put on the ventilator a couple of days ago. His test came back positive yesterday, but by then his condition was already deteriorating,” said Dr Dey, who continues to go to the hospital in the absence of a written directive asking those who are aged to stay at home.Dr Ghosh is reportedly the second doctor who died of Covid-19 in the city so far. Earlier this month, Dr JN Pande, former head of the medicine department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences had succumbed to the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-sees-a-dip-after-recording-over-2k-cases-three-days-in-a-row/story-LILnNCbTn0RULm7KSIaNbP.html
16-06-2020||Delhi||Vigilance department probing if Delhi cops misused Section 188||Did Delhi Police misuse Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code to harass people while enforcing the lockdown? That’s what the department’s own vigilance cell seems to think according to a circular issued. In the circular, a copy of which has been seen by HT, the cell asks all station house officers to “scrutinize arrests made or to be made” under Section 188 (the technical phrasing is “disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant”) and to “exercise provisions of the section judiciously”.The lockdown lasted 68 days and ended on May 31 although some restrictions still continue. Delhi police data accessed by HT shows that between March 23 and June 8, Delhi police registered 25,679 cases under section 188 . At least 25,000 people were also arrested in the same period and released on bail.The data also shows that in the same period, police detained 3,97,836 people for violating lockdown under section 65 of the Delhi Police act (the technical phrasing is “persons bound to comply with the reasonable directions of police officer) and impounded 41,021 vehicles.A police officer, who asked not to be named, said offences under section 188, in the current context, may lead to six months of imprisonment or Rs 1,000 fine or both.In the circular dated May 28, the joint commissioner of police, vigilance, said that “many complaints have been received against police officials regarding misuse of section 188 during enforcement of lockdown guidelines. It has further been observed that section 188 is being misused sometimes as a tool for unnecessary harassment.”The circular adds that the commissioner of police has taken “a serious view of this and directed that all station house officers shall scrutinize all arrests made or to be made in the FIRs registered under section 188 and ensure that the provision for arrest are exercised judiciously.” Delhi police spokesperson, deputy commissioner of police MS Randhawa said the station house officers have been asked to monitor the situation at their level and ensure zero harassment to the public.The police did not share the number of total complaints received against policemen misusing section 188 of the IPC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/vigilance-department-probing-if-delhi-cops-misused-sec-188/story-vNctjEI63QBeadjW1q4p4L.html
16-06-2020||Delhi||Govt to rope in 12,000 more civil defence volunteers by weekend||The Delhi government is looking to rope in around 12,000 more civil defence volunteers as part of its drive to scale up the city’s hospital bed capacity to 150,000 by July 31 to combat the raging Covid-19 pandemic.“As many as 11,930 individuals have applied between June 1 and June 14 to enrol as civil defence volunteers in Delhi. We are trying to officially induct them by the end of this week,” a senior government official said on condition of anonymity. The official further said, “In normal circumstances, a month-long training programme and a thorough police verification process follow the application. But the Delhi government has requested the office of the directorate of civil defence to postpone both the training and verification process at least till the Covid-19 pandemic subsides. We need volunteers urgently.”As part of the current augmentation drive, volunteers familiar with computers shall be engaged as data operators, assistants to digitise health records and perform other back-end tasks, while others will primarily help guard the facilities, ranging from banquet halls and hotels to sports complexes and sheds in open grounds, facilitate the movement of patients before admission and after discharge, and assist in healthcare logistics among other tasks, a senior official in the government’s revenue department, who did not wish to be named, said. Delhi is sanctioned around 238,000 civil defence volunteers, according to the Union ministry’s website. However, senior government officials said the city has only 46,000 enrolled volunteers, of which around 13,000 are on active duty. The volunteers are not bound by any job contract and are paid an emolument of around ₹730 for a day’s duty.“The new induction is likely to take the number of active civil defence volunteers to around 25,000. After this, we will still need 25,000 more volunteers by mid-July,” the revenue department official said.During Sunday’s meeting with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, Union home minister Amit Shah had said that volunteers of the National Cadet Corps, Scouts and National Service Scheme shall be deployed for Covid-19 management in Delhi. “This can be immensely helpful, but, so far, there is a lack of clarity on the volunteer strength that will be available for Delhi,” said the revenue department official.Delhi’s revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said: “Civil defence volunteers continue to play a major role in the capital’s fight against Covid-19 — from manning barricades at containment zones to the doorstep delivery of essentials, the distribution of food at hunger centres, the distribution of ration and the adherence to government guidelines in public buses. In the next few days, we are looking forward to more recruitment.”“We will need more helping hands as the city gets ready for an intense exercise focused on augmentation of its healthcare capacity in the next two months,” Delhi’s chief secretary Vijay Dev said.Technically, the revenue department official explained, the induction of civil defence volunteers is a round-the-year exercise. But whenever there is a specific task, the government publishes advertisements, anticipating bulk applications.The last such advertisement — published on May 23 — faced heavy criticism as it mentioned the state of Sikkim as part of a neighbouring country. The advertisement led to the suspension of a senior officer in the directorate of civil defence (headquarters). The correct version of the advertisement was re-published on May 25 in several publications.On Sunday, when HT visited the premises of a spiritual organisation in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur, civil defence volunteers were spotted guarding a shed which is being converted into a 10,000-bed capacity makeshift hospital. Kuldeep Nagar, a volunteer at the site, said that he was earlier deployed at a ration distribution centre for crowd management to ensure social distancing, and that all beneficiaries in the queue wore face masks. “I have also guarded a containment zone that was de-notified in the first week of May,” he said. Dharamveer Nagar, another volunteer deployed currently in east Delhi, said: “The spike in the number of Covid-19 cases, especially among those working on the frontlines, is a cause of concern. Will we be given beds in the temporary hospitals being set up if one of us contracts the disease?”Jugal Kishore, head of community medicines department in Safdarjung Hospital, said: “The participation of volunteers plays an important role in any public health initiative. They not only help the administration in a wide range of works, but also do better to change the perception of the people, which is much needed, as the number of Covid-19 cases is going up exponentially now. However, there is no substitute for proper training.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/govt-to-rope-in-12-000-more-civil-defence-volunteers-by-weekend/story-n40R00KF4DKpt6YkymK2xK.html
16-06-2020||Delhi||Restricted entry into stations, destination-specific queues likely in Metro reopening plan||The Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) is working with the Delhi Police and the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) officials to work out a list of standard operating procedures (SOPs) to be followed before restarting train services, officials with direct knowledge of the matter said. Metro services in Delhi have remained suspended since March 22, when the janta curfew was observed. While other modes of public transport have been allowed with restrictions during the gradual easing of lockdown norms, Metro services have remained suspended. Before it was halted, Delhi Metro carried 24 lakh passengers daily. Officials said some of the ideas under discussion include restricting the entry of passengers at the station gates, marking separate entry/exit gates and maintaining queues based on the destination. HT had reported last month about several other measures that are being taken by the DMRC as preparations to restart train services. These included increasing the stoppage time at each station, marking seats for commuters to sit alternately inside the trains, earmarking space on station floors, including platforms, for passengers to stand while in queue, etc. These measures are based on guidelines provided by the Union ministry of housing and urban affairs (MoHUA) to all Metro corporations in the country to drafting SOPs.While no senior officer, who is authorised to speak to the media, wished to comment on how the Metro may start its operation, HT has learnt that the three agencies -- DMRC, Delhi Police and CISF -- have agreed on some protocols. “Entry inside the platform will be restricted. The Delhi police will be responsible for ensuring social distancing of passengers outside the gates. It will be a joint effort. The CISF, which handles security inside the station, will inform police in real time about the status of crowd inside so that they could allow gradual entry of passengers. It was unanimously decided in the meetings that every effort will be made to ensure no crowd on the platforms,” a police officer, who did not wish to be named.A senior DMRC officer, privy to the discussions, said at major stations which witness high footfall every day, the entry gates will be changed to destination specific gates. This means, the officer explained, at a station where the trains go to different stations, separate queues will be maintained for different destinations. “Every person standing in a queue outside the station will be standing in a destination specific queue and entry gate. Hand sanitisers will be made available at each gate. The CISF personnel will also record the temperature of the passengers using the thermal scanner. It has to be a coordinated effort between the three agencies in real time,” the officer added.The CISF may also install glass curtains near the X-ray baggage scanners. At the airport and railway stations, the CISF and the Delhi police are already using such glass curtains. It has also received a good feedback, a police officer said. The Ministry of Home Affairs, in a notification issued last month, said it will take a call on restarting metro services in the third phase. Under the first phase, markets, malls, shops and religious palces were allowed to open. Phase two envisages reopening of schools, colleges, coaching centres after the Centre holds consultations with the state governments. The decision on reopening these institutions will be taken in July based on the scale of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the national capital region (NCR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/restricted-entry-into-stations-destination-specific-queues-likely-in-metro-reopening-plan/story-fZGPaB7u9okUYLOQKnM7dO.html
16-06-2020||Gurugram||Haryana CM constitutes committee to cap Covid-19 treatment cost in private hospitals||Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who was in the city on Monday, constituted a committee to put forward recommendations regarding a price cap on the escalating on the treatment costs of Covid-19 patients in private hospitals of the city. With Gurugram being largely dependent upon the private healthcare sector to tackle Covid-19 crisis, cases have been reported where people are paying more than ₹80,000 per day for the ICU facility.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“The chief minister has constituted a committee under the chairmanship of the divisional commissioner to give recommendations on the treatment cost of Covid-19. These recommendations have to be submitted within a week,” said VS Kundu, CEO, Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), who is also the monitoring in-charge for Covid-19 in the district. Another senior official present at the review meeting held on Monday evening, said, “Currently, private hospitals are charging ₹80,000 per day for ICU facility. The proposal is to reduce the charges to ₹23,000 per day. However, some private hospitals have raised objections to this proposal. Therefore, a committee has been constituted comprising the divisional commissioner, MCG commissioner and chief medical officer(CMO)to submit the final report.” The state government in the last two months has issued a series of orders on fixing the package rates of Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals and colleges. As per the order, government employees, pensioners and their dependents would avail the treatment as per the state government’s reimbursement policies. Any patient who has public or private health insurance will avail the treatment as per the policy. The beneficiaries of Ayushman Bharat would be covered under the scheme. As per the rates defined under the Ayushman Bharat scheme, per day cost of an isolation bed is ₹2,000 and ₹5,000 for those hospitalised in the intensive care unit, having ventilators and other facilities.On May 22, the state health department issued another order for patients who do not fit in the mentioned categories. In such a situation, Covid-19 hospitals will have to charge as per their existing rates and state government would reimburse the expenditure as per the Ayushman Bharat scheme. The balance amount would be paid by the patient. Out of the final medical bill, the details regarding the portion to be covered under the Ayushman Bharat scheme would be submitted to the civil surgeon. The bills submitted by the private hospitals will be reimbursed to the private hospitals, only after verification by the committee chaired by the civil surgeon, or the chief medical officer and the district nodal officerDuring the review meeting, a proposal was also placed before the CM to impose lockdown in order to break the chain of transmission as the number of cases are increasing, confirmed the senior officials present in the meeting. “A decision regarding the reimposition of a lockdown is yet to be taken,” said the senior official privy to the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cm-constitutes-a-committee-to-cap-the-covid-19-treatment-cost-in-private-hospitals/story-VcMuLUxgLtASztlYZxtSlN.html
16-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram records 183 new cases; Covid-19 count inches closer to 3,500||With 183 new coronavirus cases being reported on Monday, the district’s total Covid-19 tally touched 3,477 cases, as per the data revealed by the district health department bulletin. Six people succumbed to the infection on Monday, with the death toll reaching 37. Out of the 183 new cases, 162 cases were reported from Gurugram city block, 14 cases from Pataudi block, four from Farukkhnagar block, while three cases are from Sohna block.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageGurugram currently has 1,702 active cases of Covid-19, of which 157 are under care at dedicated Covid-19 hospitals (DCH). Of the remaining number of active cases, 364 patients are under care at dedicated Covid-19 healthcare centres (DCHC), while 76 are under watch at the district Covid-19 care centres (DCCC), based on their symptoms. The remaining are in home isolation. However, Gurugram’s chief medical officer(CMO), Dr Virender Yadav, said that a significant majority of those testing positive for Covid-19 continue to be either asymptomatic or display mild symptoms. As of Monday,1,068 patients have been kept in home isolation. “Home isolation is a more effective containment measure. If their symptoms worsen, they will be taken to any one of the DCH, DCHC, or DCCC facilities, depending on the severity of the symptoms,” said Yadav. The district conducted 308 new tests on Monday, up from 169 tests conducted the previous day. The test positivity rate(TPR), although high at 59.4%, was down from 69% on Sunday. The district’s cumulative TPR worked out to be 18%, up from 17%, on Sunday. Gurugram’s cummulative TPR is four times that Haryana’s, which stands at 4.19%. “The cumulative TPR numbers in Haryana and Gurugram are showing an upward trend in the past few weeks. This is also the case in many other states with a high case load. This indicates that testing in the state and the district has not been able to keep up with the spread of the virus and that a large number of cases remain undetected within the population at large,” said Dheeraj Singh, a city-based data scientist, who has been tracking the state and district data.Meanwhile, Haryana recorded 514 new cases on Monday, marking the biggest single-day jump in the number of positive cases so far. Gurugram contributed the largest share of this increment, followed by Faridabad, which reported 128 new cases, and Sonepat, which reported 63 new cases. The tally of the state now stands at 7,722 cases, with close to half having recovered from the infection. With 562 new discharges on Monday, Haryana’s recovery rate now stands at 46%. Monday’s bulletin also provided data, disaggregated by sex. Of the 7,722 cases, 5,293 are male, while 2,429 are female. Of the 100 deaths recorded in the state so far, 68 are males, while 32 are females. The state’s current doubling rate is eight days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-records-183-new-cases-covid-19-count-inches-closer-to-3-500/story-zxVTIoxzX9PkZDhOxHh26L.html
16-06-2020||Gurugram||Many shut shops while others seek reduced rent at Gurugram markets||Owners of establishments, such as retail outlets, gyms and standalone eateries, in city’s popular markets are renegotiating their rent agreements and seeking suspension of payments as the three-month-long lockdown has created uncertainty over their businesses.Many business owners have also vacated their shops at markets in sectors 22, 23 and 31, and other markets of the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP), seeking relief for the next few months, till the situation normalises. While occupants of some establishments have been able to get relief, a majority of them have been left in limbo due to the tough situation, according to market associations.A majority of the shop owners in HSVP markets sign leases, which are notarised, for 11 months and pay monthly rent in the first week of the month.Rakesh Malik, the president of the Sector 22 market association, said that in view of the prevailing situation, they had held a meeting with owners and tried to convince them to reduce and even remit rent in extreme cases. “We haven’t approached the government yet and are trying to manage the situation on our own, but if things go further downhill, we might seek help from authorities,” he said.Shabnam Manchanda, who runs a state-of-the-art gym in Sector 22, says that besides paying ₹2.5 lakh per month in rent, she has to pay electricity bills, maintenance costs and salary of her employees. “Right now, the rent and electricity bills are the biggest worries and we have requested our owner to reduce it so that we can survive the tough situation. The government should also help by either remitting the power bill or offer a large discount,” said Manchanda, adding that even when her gym opens, there is no certainty that members would return.The worst-hit establishments are small cafes, eateries and restaurants, as the business has remained negligible even after resuming operations.There are 134 shops in the sector 22 market, out of which 15 to 20 shops have either vacated or are in the process of shutting shop.Inderpal Singh, who runs a popular eatery in Sector 22, said that he used to pay ₹70,000 in rent for two shops, but with business down to just 10% of the pre-Covid days, he is vacating the larger shop to cut down on rent. “I come from Delhi daily, have to pay salaries and other overheads. The government must change restaurant timings so that people can order food for dinner and this is how the industry can survive,” he says.Shops have been left without customers as around 15,000 IT and ITes employees, who used to live in 428 paying guest houses (out of the 619 total plots) in Sector 22, have returned to their home states, says Rakesh Malik, president of the Sector 22 market Association. “This huge population used to visit the restaurants, gyms, juice shops and other establishments in sector 21, 22 and 23 markets and adjoining areas. Now, they are gone and business is in a lurch,” he said, adding that one of his tenants also vacated a shop, while another has asked for heavy remission of rent.The situation is similar in Sector 31 as well, says Abhinay Baweja, who runs a restaurant and food business. “Almost 10 to 15% of the shop owners, especially those who were new, have vacated the shops as they could not pay rent. Others are trying to get their rent reduced and remitted, but these efforts mostly are not very successful,” he said.There are around 200 shops in the Sector 31 market, of which 30-40 shops are in the food business. Around 12 to 15 shops in the market have vacated and many tenants are trying to negotiate reduced rents with the owners.Baweja says that the property owners should take a reasonable view of the situation and handhold business owners in these difficult times. “All of us paid rent on time, but the situation at present is unimaginable, as no one can predict what will happen,” he said.In Sector 23, shop owners say that not many have vacated shops. “The situation is no doubt bad, but we are trying to manage,” said a shop owner on the condition of anonymity.Satinder Yadav, general secretary of the market said that in Sector 23, there are around 150 shops. The market association has tried to ensure that those businesses, which can’t pay rent, are given relief. “We are asking everyone to be reasonable in these difficult times and as such, only a few shops have vacated,” he said.In Palam Vihar, property owners said that there has not been an instance of owners vacating shops, but that tenants are requesting for major rent remissions. “No shop owner has yet vacated the premises but if the situation remains similar, this is also going to happen,” said Gaurav Kumar, who owns a chemist shop.Harender Rana, the president of the Palam Vihar Market Association said that small eateries and takeaway shops have shut operations, but larger shops are surviving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/many-shut-shops-while-others-seek-reduced-rent-at-city-markets/story-X10mMCYibeijUSAjRfy9SO.html
16-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi High Court allows two hotels to be used as Covid facilities||The Delhi High Court on Monday allowed the Delhi government to attach two city hotels as extended Covid-19 facilities after a two-doctor court-appointed committee said it was possible to use them as Covid care centres for asymptomatic patients or those with mild symptoms.The court had on June 11 formed a committee comprising AIIMS director Randeep Guleria and Niti Aayog member VK Paul to submit a report on the feasibility of using the hotels as extended Covid facilities. The hotels -- Crowne Plaza, Okhla and Hotel Surya, New Friends Colony — had moved court against the Delhi government’s decision to convert them into hospitals.The committee in its report submitted on Monday said even though the hotels have not been designed as hospitals and the guest rooms do not have oxygen supply, patient monitoring devices, etc, they have banquet halls, which can be appropriately equipped and converted into dedicated Covid health centres, if need arises, on account of an acute shortage of hospital beds in the capital.Justice Navin Chawla allowed the government to use the hotels after additional solicitor general Sanjay Jain, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government advocate Gautam Narayan and the petitioners agreed with the findings of the report. The report said medical care must be provided to Covid patients in these hotels by the attached hospitals in line with the requirement as these are primarily to be used as Covid care centres for asymptomatic (with no facility of home quarantine) patients and mild cases. Crowne Plaza is attached with Batra hospital and Hotel Surya with Apollo.“The triage and initial evaluation for all patients being admitted to these hotels should be done at the attached hospital and the responsibility of clinical care of all patients admitted in these hotels shall rest with the hospital. A telephonic assessment of all admitted patients’ general status should be done at least once in 12 hours and physically once daily,” the report said.The committee recommended a slew of steps for the hospitals that would be attached with the hotels, including training of hotel staff in infection-control practice, including donning and doffing, a process of removal and disposal of contaminated PPE kits. It said the hospital should ensure availability of hydroxychloroquine and adequate PPE for all its health care workers and hotel staff.The report said the hotels should actively support the hospital and deploy their medically and physically fit staff for patient care activities after training by the attached hospital. It said the Delhi government should identify nodal officials as a single point contact for these hotels and the attached hospitals to facilitate any requirement such as additional manpower, outsourcing of services, help in arranging common provisions, etc.The committee did not make any recommendations on the concerns of the hotels such as loss of business, their financial condition, non-functional support systems and non-availability of manpower and left it to the Delhi government to examine.The court asked the hotels to give a representation to the Delhi government on the unaddressed grievances and posted the matter for July 29. The counsels of both hotels refused to comment, stating that the matter was subjudice.The Delhi government had on May 29 ordered five hotels to be used as Covid facilities to meet the requirement for beds in view of the spike in coronavirus cases.  The hotels are Crowne Plaza (attached with Batra Hospital; Hotel Surya (Apollo ); Hotel Siddharth (B L Kapur Memorial Hospital); Hotel Jivitesh (Sir Gangaram Hospital); Sheraton Saket (Max Super Speciality Hospital).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-high-court-allows-two-hotels-to-be-used-as-covid-facilities/story-nTFxC15q5z3IVMqyTAZg5J.html
16-06-2020||Delhi||Respond to plea quashing FIR against Ganga Ram Hospital: HC to govt||The Delhi High Court on Monday asked the Delhi government to respond to a plea by Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, which sought the quashing of an FIR lodged by the Delhi Police against it for allegedly violating Covid-19 regulation norms. The FIR was based on a complaint filed by the city government.Justice C Hari Shankar issued a notice to the Delhi government and said that it would hear the interim application seeking a stay on the proceedings of the FIR on Tuesday.Appearing for the hospital, advocate Rohit Aggarwal told the court that they were seeking the quashing of the FIR lodged on June 5 at Rajendra Nagar police station under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code and the proceedings initiated thereafter.He contended that the FIR registered against them was “vague” and did not show that any offence was committed under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). He said that the FIR did not say as to how disobedience, as alleged by the Delhi government, caused obstruction, annoyance or injury to any person.Advocate Rahul Mehra, standing counsel (criminal) for the Delhi government, sought some time from the court, following which the argument on the stay application was listed for Tuesday.The Delhi government had filed an FIR against the medical superintendent of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Rajendra Nagar for not following protocols for testing patients with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The FIR was filed in June on the basis of a complaint by the deputy secretary of Delhi’s department of health and family welfare, Amit Kumar Pamasi.The FIR has been filed under Section 188 of the IPC that allows the punishment of one month’s simple imprisonment and/or ₹200 fine or six months imprisonment and/ or ₹1,000 fine if the offence puts human life at risk. The section of the IPC can be invoked under the Epidemic Diseases Act that has been in force in Delhi since mid-March as the city battles the Covid-19 pandemic.On June 3, the hospital was asked by the Delhi government in an order to stop Covid-19 testing, citing violations of ICMR guidelines. However, on Saturday, the Delhi government had again granted them permission to start testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/respond-to-plea-quashing-fir-against-ganga-ram-hospital-hc-to-govt/story-vVQJvPFzumIVNbP7ikXj7H.html
16-06-2020||Delhi||Commuting remains a challenge in a city slowly crawling back to life||After waiting for nearly 35 minutes at a Barakhamba Road bus stop, Neeraj Kumar (25), a resident of Moti Nagar, manages to get on to a Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) bus headed towards his house. Three buses to his destination did not stop at the stand; they were full as per social distancing norms set by the Centre, he says.“This is the new normal. Commuting has become a big problem, as the Metro is not working and buses often don’t stop as they are full,” said Kumar, who works as a field agent with a chartered accountancy firm.Anita Devi (45), a resident of Sultanpuri, said it took her two-and-a-half hours to reach the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital. While waiting at the bus stop outside the hospital, she said: “I came here after almost three months to get medicines, but neither could I meet the doctor nor get the medicines. I have been waiting for 45 minutes. But the buses are also not stopping at the stand.”As the national capital opens up from a lockdown in a phased manner amid the Covid-19 outbreak, commuting has become a hurdle for many. The Delhi Metro is yet to resume services and buses are operating only in limited numbers. DTC has a fleet of 3,724 buses and the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) has 2,830 cluster buses. While DIMTS officials say that all its 2,830 buses are operating, DTC has been able to press into service only about 50% of its fleet.With nearly six million passenger trips daily, the Delhi Metro is the transport lifeline of Delhi-NCR. With no word on when the Centre will allow the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to resume operations, the state-run bus system is the only cost-effective option available to people.According to a senior official in the transport department, close to 700 buses are on police and special duty. “Of the remaining 3,000, nearly 1,800 buses are plying on the roads. We have not received any complaints so far about shortage of buses,” the official said, asking not to be named.When asked why fewer DTC buses were operating, the official cited multiple reasons. “There are many reasons. Some of our drivers are not able to come as they live in neighbouring states which have strict border restrictions. Some others are 55 and above in age. Some of our staff has also tested positive for Covid-19 due to which others had to be placed in home quarantine. But we are trying to work out a way so that sufficient numbers of buses are on the roads.”Commuters say they now plan their work keeping in mind the time it takes to reach home, as there is a curfew in place after 9pm. “We now have to plan our work schedule according to the availability of buses,” said Mahinder Singh, an IT professional.Due to the restrictions imposed to check the spread of Covid-19 — curfew from 9pm, limited number of passengers in buses and e-rickshaws and inadequate public transportation — Singh said commuting was proving to be a challenge.“Earlier, I would visit 4-5 places for work. But now, I don’t take any assignments after 4pm, as I have to plan my trip back home. Now, we have to wait for a minimum of 30 minutes for buses. I can’t afford to take auto-rickshaw every day as I have to visit multiple locations,” said Singh, who lives in Rajouri Garden.Transport expert Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director at the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), said that efforts should be made to ensure availability of adequate public transport system so that people don’t switch to private vehicles. “People are switching to personal vehicles due to safety reasons and also due to a shortage of public transport. The capacity of buses has further gone down due to the restrictions of 20 passengers. Like they do during the odd-even scheme in peak pollution season, the government should pool resources to meet the requirement of public transport.”A senior government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: “So far, there is no plan to rope in private players. But we are trying to ensure that 90-95% DTC buses are out on the roads, especially during peak hours.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/commuting-remains-a-challenge-in-a-city-slowly-crawling-back-to-life/story-lChJPqiY0ICvpBEjF0T23L.html
16-06-2020||Delhi||Bodies piling up at Lok Nayak hospital was an ‘unfortunate’ incident, govt tells HC||The Delhi government on Monday told the Delhi High Court that piling up of the dead bodies at Lok Nayak hospital mortuary last month was an “unfortunate incident” because of “unavoidable circumstances”. The government also stated that it is now working on a war footing to clear the backlog of bodies.The submissions to the high court were made by advocate Sanjoy Ghose, additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, while hearing a plea which the court had initiated. The high court had filed a public interest litigation on the basis of a May 27 Hindustan Times report that highlighted how bodies were piling up at the mortuary as the four CNG furnaces at Nigambodh Ghat CNG crematorium lay defunct. Most bodies were being returned to the mortuary. The Delhi government in its submission also informed the court that a team from the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) took stock of the ground situation at the hospital and gave its preliminary report stating that on their inspection last week, they found no bodies lying in the corridor and also emergency patients being attended to. The NHRC had visited the hospital last week, after residents took to social media to complain that there were no beds for patients at the hospital. On Monday, advocate Ghose told the court that the NHRC’s preliminary report said that no critical patient is being denied admission in the hospital and patients are allowed to carry mobile phones and home cooked food. He also said that from May 30 to June 12, at least 338 bodies were sent to the crematoriums. The government in its submission also presented data of the total bodies cleared from the mortuary since May 30. He also said that free of cost ambulance services were being given by the Delhi government for transporting bodies to the crematoriums.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Sanjay Jain told the court that the Supreme Court has also taken suo moto cognizance of the reports of bodies at Lok Nayak hospital. He urged the court to wait for the order of the Apex court and sought for an adjournment. Following this, the court posted the matter for further hearing on June 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/bodies-piling-up-at-lok-nayak-hospital-was-an-unfortunate-incident-govt-tells-hc/story-bpJ2HTeIYiZhnOBTCz1MtK.html
16-06-2020||Delhi||No plan to bring back lockdown: Kejriwal||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday said there was no plan on any further lockdown in the Capital, dismissing speculation about reimposition of restrictions in the light of a severe spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi.“Many people are speculating whether another lockdown is being planned in Delhi. There are no such plans,” Arvind Kejriwal tweeted, soon after senior Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders Sanjay Singh and Pankaj Gupta attended an all-party meeting chaired by Union home minister Amit Shah to discuss strategies to fight Covid.According to Monday’s health bulletin, Delhi recorded 1,647 new Covid cases and 73 more deaths in the last 24 hours, taking the cumulative total to 42,829 and 1,400 respectively.Last week, Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain had dismissed as rumours all speculation about Delhi witnessing another lockdown from June 15. The Centre had also said there was no plan to reintroduce restrictions.On June 1, the Delhi government had relaxed lockdown norms, allowing markets and industrial areas in the city to operate all day and reducing curfew timings. On June 8, the government allowed shopping malls, restaurants and religious places to reopen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/no-plan-to-bring-back-lockdown-kejriwal/story-xCEmkUJ1g1VnqKIkCLB0vN.html
16-06-2020||Delhi||Confusion at Anand Vihar amid news of isolation coaches||Confusion prevailed at Delhi’s Anand Vihar Railway Station amid reports that train services would be stopped from the station on Monday as all platforms would be reserved for Covid-19 isolation coaches.A day after the Centre promised assistance in mitigating the shortage of beds across the capital to tackle the Covid-19 crisis, the Railways on Monday announced that 500 railway coaches converted into isolation wards would be deployed in Delhi—of which around 180 would be stationed at Anand Vihar. Earlier, the Railways had deployed 50 coaches at the Shakur Basti Railway Station (which are unused so far). “Around 50 coaches containing 900 beds have already been deployed at Shakur Basti. Around 170-180 coaches will be placed at Anand Vihar by Tuesday and the rest will be placed at other stations. Around 20 more coaches will be stationed at third station by Tuesday. The name of the third station will be finalised by Tuesday morning,” Deepak Kumar, chief public relations officer of Northern Railways, said on Monday.“These refurbished coaches can be used to isolate suspected and confirmed cases. The Railways will provide water, electricity, charging facilities and three oxygen cylinders per isolation coach. We have installed ramps and drawn circles to ensure social distancing,” Kumar said.However, unlike Shakur Basti, where the coaches are deployed in the washing area and have not interrupted train services, the five trains running to and from Anand Vihar will be operating from the Old Delhi Railway Station, until further orders, beginning Tuesday. Railways officials at Shakur Basti said the entry-exit of patients is from a different area and the functioning of trains will not be disrupted.However, passengers outside the Anand Vihar Railway Station were confused on Monday. “We got to know through news reports that trains to and from Anand Vihar would run from Old Delhi Railway Station from Monday. So we went there first. But we were told to go back to Anand Vihar. Due to this confusion, we had to travel extra miles in this weather unnecessarily,” Vijay Kumar, who works as a contractual driver in a private firm in west Delhi, said.Railways officials said that the notices were issued while keeping the “journey commencing dates” in mind. “For instance, trains coming from Muzaffarpur, which started today, will terminate at Old Delhi Railway Station on Tuesday instead of Anand Vihar. The journey commencing date from the other end had to be taken into account,” said a Railways official, requesting anonymity. The station bore an empty look on Monday, barring sanitation workers and very few functioning food stalls. “We visited the Anand Vihar Railway Station on Monday to take stock and formulate plans regarding security once the coaches arrive tomorrow,” said DCP (Railways) Harinder Kumar Singh.At the Shakur Basti Railway Station—where the first Covid Care Centre was deployed on May 31—the Railway Protection Force is in charge of guarding these coaches. Any untoward incident is to be taken care of by the local police, officials said. So far, there are no Covid-19 patients in these coaches. On Monday, the Railway Board Chairman said that Covid isolation coaches are meant to be used when the health infrastructure of various states is exhausted due to the spike in Covid-19 cases across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/confusion-at-anand-vihar-amid-news-of-isolation-coaches/story-frHZbwMfaAKwRdk52obIKL.html
16-06-2020||Delhi||Mohalla clinic doctor dies of Covid-19||A doctor working at a mohalla clinic in Najafgarh died due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Monday. He was 65.The doctor, UC Ghosh, had started working at the clinic just three months ago after his wife died of cancer in March this year. “He was lonely and depressed after his wife died. He had given up practice to take care of his wife. The clinic came as a welcome respite for him. It is likely that he got the infection there,” said Dr BK Dey, 65, his family friend, who works at Maharshi Valmiki hospital.Ghosh was diabetic and hypertensive, according to a Delhi government official. “We have asked our senior doctors to not open clinic at present. However, there are many who still volunteer to do so,” the official said.According to his friend, Ghosh started losing his sense of taste and smell about 12 days ago and was very lethargic. “He would come home from the clinic and just go to bed. His daughter did not think too much of it, but maybe that’s when he got the infection,” Dey said.Ghosh started vomiting and developed high-grade fever four days ago and had to be admitted to a hospital in Dwarka, where he lives. “He was admitted to the ICU and was put on ventilator a couple of days ago. His test came positive yesterday, but by then his condition was already very bad,” said Dey, who continues to go to the hospital in the absence of a written directive asking the elderly to stay at home.Ghosh is reportedly the second doctor to have died with Covid-19 in the city so far. Earlier this month, Dr JN Pande, former head of medicine department at All India Institute of Medical Sciences, had died due to the viral disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mohalla-clinic-doctor-dies-of-covid-19/story-XvfThrytBpHEIWGJEPZuqK.html

16-06-2020||Mumbai||BMC’s focus areas: Reducing deaths; quicker medical help||The city will soon be able to bring down its mortality rate to 3%, from the current 3.2%, and on a par with the national average of less than 2%, assured Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) chief IS Chahal on Tuesday.“We have managed to bring down Mumbai’s mortality to 3.2% from the high figure of over 7% in April. This was a result of targeted measures taken by the civic body. With the measures in place, in a few days, mortality will further go down to 3%,” Chahal said at a video-conference with the media organised on Tuesday evening.As of Tuesday, Mumbai has a total of 32,974 Covid-19 cases, with 1,065 deaths. According to data from the BMC, there are 22,912 active cases in Mumbai (total cases minus the number of deaths and discharged patients). Mumbai has so far conducted 1.75 lakh tests, with 13,000 tests per million of the population. Among the measures taken are contact-tracing and early detection of high-risk co-morbid persons, shifting such persons to government facilities for observation, detecting elderly and co-morbid patients with low oxygen saturation, streamlining rules of dialysis. “We cannot let the number scare us. We have to gauge Mumbai’s situation by our health infrastructure’s ability to handle a surge. We have to see if we have doctors, nurses, beds and equipment such as critical beds, ventilators, and oxygen beds.”Contrary to the projection that Mumbai will have 44,000-46,000 cases by the end of May, the city is expected to have 26,000 to 27,000 active cases by the end of May, the municipal commissioner said. In comparison, Mumbai will have 14,000 hospital and healthcare beds by May-end, and already has 29,949 beds for mild symptomatic patients, called Covid Care Centres - category 2 (CCC2) facilities, he said.Following reports of delays in bed and ambulance allocation to critical patients, with allegations of deaths of such patients due to delay, the BMC has decided to revamp its bed management system. Chahal attributed the delay to BMC’s cycle of reporting cases and preparing a bed demand chart, over-burdened 1916 helplines, and private labs relaying information of patients upto 4 or 5 days late. “The earlier cycle of reporting patients was 2pm to 2pm. Labs would report cases up to 4pm. Hence, the final list of patients would be compiled by 7pm. Bed allotment would start after 7pm, and go on till 1.30am or later. Doctors were tired, and patients were receiving calls of bed availability in the middle of the night.” With the new cycle, the list will be prepared overnight after reporting is completed at midnight and bed allotment will start at 8am, with a deadline for bed allotment to these cases till 12 noon. Reporting and bed allotment will also happen at 2pm, 3pm, 5pm, and 9pm, said Chahal.Private labs have been instructed not to delay in reporting names of Covid-19 positive patients, that must be submitted on the same day. At the end of the day, there should be zero pending cases to be reported to BMC. If this procedure is not followed, labs can lose their licence.BMC has decided to increase the number of 1916 helplines. To ensure ambulance services are received on time, ambulances will be fitted with a GPS tracker, and will be centrally allotted to nearest persons based on their location. “Citizens will also be able to Uber an ambulance very soon,” Chahal said.“Based on the CM’s request for Covid warriors, 3700 doctors, nurses and paramedical staff responded for Mumbai. We asked them for a choice of where they want to work”, Chahal said. “Of these, 570 doctors and nurses have chosen jumbo facilities, or Seven hills hospital, and received their appointment letters on Tuesday.” BMC needs their help in opening clinics for non-Covid patients, because facilities for Covid patients are being managed well. To ensure all satellite medical services are fully functional, Chahal said, suburban trains should be started on a “skeleton basis” during work hours of 7am to 10am and 5pm to 8pm, to ferry workers home. “Presently, staff from neighbourhoods of Mumbai such Nerul and Panvel travel to Mumbai by road, and spend up to six hours per day changing buses and commuting to and from work.” This is reduced to 2.5 hours per day by local train. If trains cannot be started, BMC has decided to increase the frequency of BEST buses.It has also launched ‘Chase the Virus Mission’ to trace upto 15 high-risk contacts per positive person in slum areas, up from the earlier target of 10 high-risk contacts per positive person.Will continue giving HCQS to frontline workers, high-risk contacts: State govtThe state government has clarified that it will continue administering Hydroxychloroquine (HCQS) given to high-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients and the frontline workers, as per the Indian Council For Medical Research (ICMR) protocol. The government officials said that the doses given in the country are milder in quantity than the World Health Organization (WHO) trial and the concerns raised by the WHO were not applicable here.“We have been giving two tablets of 400mg in the first week and then one tablet of 400 mg each for the next six weeks.WHO was giving two tablets of 800mg each in the first week and 800mg in the subsequent six weeks. The benefit of the HCQS is outweighed by the potential risk in people to whom the doses are administered,” said Pradeep Vyas, principal secretary, public health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bmc-s-focus-areas-reducing-deaths-quicker-medical-help/story-ESgUzQWTamMu8TRsyXNjiM.html
