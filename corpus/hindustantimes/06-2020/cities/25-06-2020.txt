25-06-2020||Gurugram||182 people covered under Covid-19 sero-survey, 32 found to have developed antibodies||The district administration has till Thursday tested at least 182 people as part of its serological survey to check for the undetected community transmission of Covid-19.The health department on Thursday collected samples of 90 people to check for coronavirus antibodies in their blood serum. The sample was collected from Tigra, one of the worst-affected areas in the district, which has reported more than 226 cases. Till now, tests showed, at least 32 people had developed antibodies against coronavirus.Earlier this week, the health officials had collected 92 samples from pockets like Dundahera, Sirhaul, Pataudi, sector 14, among others, for antibody testing.A serological survey includes IgG Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) test. It estimates the proportion of population exposed to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The IgG test is not useful for detecting acute infections but it indicates episodes of SARS-CoV-2 infections that has happened in the past. The test is approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for its high sensitivity and specificity. The test has been conducted in 75 districts across the country as part of a study. It was found that less than one percent of the population – 0.73% - in non-containment zones was found to have contracted the virus.The sero survey has to be done in 460 people across different pockets of the city. Along with Gurugram, four other districts – Faridabad, Ambala, Panchkula and Sonepat – are also being covered in the survey. Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer of the district, said, “Blood samples of only those people have been taken who have had high exposure to the contagious infection. It includes people who came in contact with a large group of people on a daily basis, such as health workers, police personnel, taxi drivers and sanitation staff among others.”For conducting the survey, five mililitre blood samples is collected from the subjects. It is then put in a machine where blood and plasma are separated. The plasma is then used to detect antibodies developed against Covid-19 in the body. The city has received five sets, having 92 kits each, for conducting the survey. Ambala and Panchkula have got two sets each, while Faridabad and Sonepat have got five sets each. Each kit can be tested together in a single run of two and a half hours.Yadav said that the sero surveillance was started earlier this week and 50% of the kits are being used on patients who tested positive in the last two weeks. The remaining will be used on people who confirmed negative. “Out of 92 people tested, 32 had IgG antibodies,” said Yadav.The team had collected 92 samples earlier this week, which included samples of 50 people, who had recovered from Covid-19 in the past. The remaining 42 samples were of those who had no history of Covid-19. Of these 92 samples, only 32 — 26 in the first set and six in the second — were found to have IgG antibody in their blood serum. Studies shows, the IgG antibodies start appearing two weeks after the onset of infection.Gurugram is about to breach the 5,000 mark in Covid-19 cases, and going by the future projections it can reach 7,000 mark by the end of June. Yadav said that the results of sero-survey, the rapid antigen detection test and routine RT-PCR will help in identifying the appropriate health intervention required to control the surge in numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/182-people-covered-under-covid-19-sero-survey-32-found-to-have-developed-antibodies/story-U6MoLpbTLLIKrApQ7dbL2J.html

25-06-2020||Gurugram||Pvt hospitals tie up with hotels to set up isolation facility||The district administration on Thursday gave its nod to five private hospitals in the city to set up paid isolation facilities in hotels located in their vicinity. As per an order issued by Amit Khatri, deputy commissioner, on Thursday, five hotels have been notified as paid isolation facilities after they tied up with hospitals — such as Medanta Medicity, Max Hospital, W Pratiksha, among others. “We have asked hospitals to reserve beds in hotels for confirmed Covid-19 cases, who do not require critical care. But they will have to ensure proper medical facilities are provided to people with mild symptoms, who will be referred to such facilities. These hotels will be like step down medical facilities, where the hospital will be responsible for proper medical supervision of patients,” said Sonal Goel, CEO, Gurugram Metropolitan City Bus Limited, who is also the nodal officer for hospital management.An institutional isolation facility is set up for Covid-19 patients — those with mild symptoms — who do not have enough space at home or can’t be home isolated. The order stated that this move was likely to reduce the pressure on families, help protect them and their immediate neighbourhood and give comfort to the coronavirus infected patients. According to officials, there is no dearth of beds in the city at present but if Covid-19 cases increase in the coming months, the paid isolation facilities set up by private hospitals will help in dealing with the surge.Max Hospital has set up the facility at Vista Signature in South City 1. Similarly, Columbia Asia has tied up with Hotel Desire, sector 23 A, Paras Hospital with Bawa Residency in Sushant Lok sector 43, W Pratiksha Hospital with the Aurora Paradise near Nirvana Country and Medanta Hospital with Prani Health Solutions guest house. According to Goel, six other hospitals have also reached out to the administration for setting up paid isolation facilities. Dr Sandeep Budhiraja, group medical director, Max Healthcare, said, “A dedicated Covid health centre for patients with mild to moderate symptoms is a much-needed addition to the healthcare infrastructure of Gurugram in the times of a pandemic. By segregating Covid patients from the general populace, it will not only lower the risk of infection for everyone but also reduce overcrowding at hospitals, leaving more space for the treatment of non-Covid patients.”Max hospital has fixed a charge of Rs 9,500 per day for those availing their hotel facility. It will include 24x7 medical supervision, including round-the-clock availability of doctors and nurses on premises for patient care, a comprehensive Covid care plan, daily visit by a senior consultant, daily in-person monitoring by trained nurses, video consults by psychologists, oxygen support for stabilising patients, and ambulance transfer in case of an emergency. Meanwhile, a representative from Paras Hospital, said, “Our employees are also getting quarantined in the hotel we have tied up with. As patient load increases, we will be shifting some of them to the designated hotel.”The district administration too has tied up with several hotels in the city for self-paid and government paid Covid care centres. There are 13 designated hotels for self-paid isolation facilities. Over 464 beds have been reserved in these hotels for Covid patients with mild or moderate symptoms. Likewise, 1,132 beds have been kept aside in 26 hotels of the city, which are to act like government paid isolation facilities.Currently, 72 patients are in these centres. In the government paid facilities, the charges are nominal and is set at Rs 700, including taxes, which includes three meal. In the self -paid facilities the charges vary from Rs 1,000 to Rs 2,200.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/pvt-hospitals-tie-up-with-hotels-to-set-up-isolation-facility/story-Uov4u47LqhHrPq077LLj0J.html

Their samples have now been collected for RT-PCR test.” The health team will be conducting antigen test in Chakkarpur on Friday. Dr Virendra Yadav, chief medical officer, said that they are identifying areas from where maximum cases have been reported. “Through Aarogya Setu app and data of positive patients fed on the ICMR portal, we are able to figure out areas where Covid-19 clusters are emerging. Over 15 such places have been identified so far, where antigen tests will be conducted,” said Yadav. Since the district has received 8,000 antigen kits, Yadav said that a detailed plan will be prepared on utilising these kits in affected areas. As the district administration plans to have extended containment zones, which clubs together several Covid-19 affected areas, these kits are likely to be used in those zones to break the chain of transmission of the virus.On Thursday, 89 people tested positive for Covid-19 (including RT-PCR and antigen test), taking the total count of infected persons in the district to 4,851.

The antigen kits have been provided to western Uttar Pradesh districts for speedy testing for the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.“The DM has directed for formation of 30 teams comprising lab technicians and has asked officials to scout for premises such as schools buildings where testing will be taken up, where a part of the area will be converted into a holding area from where patients will be transported to healthcare facilities after tests,” said Dr NK Gupta, the district’s chief medical officer (CMO).With the help of these kits, the teams will be carrying out random sampling in containment zones and also target cases having symptoms of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory illness (SARI).“If the patients are found positive, they will be asked to wait in the holding area and ambulances will arrive to take them to healthcare facilities. The teams will carry our testing in containment zones as well as of high risk patients, besides those affected by ILI and SARI symptoms,” the CMO added. The district currently has 297 containment zones.According to officials, the Meerut division – which includes the districts of Noida and Ghaziabad – has been provided with 30,000 antigen testing kits.Initially, five districts in eastern UP were given the antigen kits for testing purposes. The western UP districts have been given the antigen test kits in the second phase, by the state government.Health department officials said teams deployed for antigen testing will be able to take up about 450-500 tests per day and will enhance daily testing capability up to 900-950 samples. At present, the health department takes up about 450 samples per day.According to the Indian Council for Medical Research’s (ICMR) guidelines, suspected individuals who test negative for Covid-19 by rapid antigen test should be definitely tested subsequently by RT-PCR to rule out the infection, whereas a positive test should be considered true positive and does not need reconfirmation by RT-PCR test.In the meantime, Ghaziabad DM Ajay Shankar Pandey also appointed six nodal officers who will keep in touch with residents who are receiving Covid treatment at various hospitals in Meerut, Noida and Delhi.“These are patients who are residents of Ghaziabad but are taking treatment outside the district. Our officers will keep in touch with them and will ensure they do not face problems during treatment. Likewise, we have deployed magistrates who are in touch with patients getting treatment at our hospitals. We have also deployed nodal officers for keeping in touch with patients who are now receiving paid Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals in Ghaziabad,” Pandey said.According to officials, there are about 16 Covid patients in Meerut, 27 in Noida district, 28 in Delhi, two in Aligarh and one in Lucknow, who are residents of Ghaziabad.GHAZIABAD RECORDS 86 FRESH CASES IN 24 HRS, NO DEATHSOn Thursday, the tally of Covid-19 cases in the district stood at 1,175, as against the total of 1,089 till Wednesday.

It involved leveraging resources at the block, district and state levels to immunize all children under five. The features of the plan includes pro-active surveillance of the population, estimating resources, recording and reporting cases and strict monitoring.Till now, patients used to inform district administration of their symptoms following which they would be tested. But with this new plan, the administration hopes to reach out to every household and monitor every case. Announcing this plan, district nodal officer (Covid-19) and senior IAS officer Narendra Bhooshan said it would be executed in containment zones. “As many as 800 teams will be constituted to monitoring and necessary action in the containment zones in the district,” he said.The district on Thursday reported the total case count at 1,811.

The facility will have 200 beds for patients and a team of 24 medical personnel. The date for the opening of the facility is yet to be decided. The building was constructed in a record time of 25 days as a collaborative project between the district administration the corporate social responsibility (CSR) team of the Tata Group.A doctor present on duty at the site said that medical personnel at the facility will work in three shifts.“There will be two doctors present, along with one pharmacist, one ward boy, two nurses and two sweepers in each shift who will administer to the patients coming here,” said the doctor, seeking anonymity.The seven-storey building was initially meant to be used as an office space but has now been converted into a hospital facility to treat the surging number of Covid-19 patients in the district, said the doctor.“The facility will have 200 beds spread across three floors, where L-1 or asymptomatic patients of Covid-19 will be administered. All arrangements have been made and we are ready to start operations soon,” said Dr Akansha Kanaujia, a shift doctor present at the site.The district magistrate had inspected the site earlier and had given instructions to curb the sources of noise around the facility.District administration officials said that all arrangements for medical services, food, housekeeping and sanitisation have been made. The district information officer said that without requisite permissions no one will be allowed to enter or exit the facility.The building is spread across 70,000 square feet of area and will be handed over by the Tata Group to the district administration for a period of at least six months. A senior health department official said, “The facility is ready to take patients and shall be opened soon.” “If the need arises, the administration can use the building for a longer period of time. Electricity and food will also be provided,” a representative of the Tata Group present at the site said, adding that the handover will happen in a day or so.On Thursday, Gautam Budh Nagar had a total of 1811 Covid cases. Treatment for Covid-19 in the district is being provided by four private hospitals, namely Yatharth, Jaypee, Kailash, Fortis, along with government facilities, such as District Hospital in Sector 39, Child PGI AND GIMS, and Sharda Hospital that has been acquired by the government.

25-06-2020||City||Targeted sampling of ILI & SARI, high risk patients leading to spike in Covid-19 cases||For the first time, Ghaziabad reported more than 100 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) a day on Tuesday, according to data released late on Wednesday night, taking the tally over the 1,000-mark. It recorded 114 new cases on the day.On Thursday, the district reported 86 fresh cases in the preceding 24 hours. In total, Ghaziabad recorded 1,175 cases, 551 patients discharged and 49 deaths till Thursday. Health officials say they expect a rise in cases with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the apex biomedical research institute in the country and also the nodal body for Covid-19 in India, revising the guidelines on testing.On Tuesday the Council expanded the testing norms, advising that all hospitals, offices and public sector units be enabled to conduct rapid antibody tests, and recommending the deployment of rapid antigen tests in all containment zones, and hospitals and private labs across the state. This meant that symptomatic patients, and not just close contacts of confirmed cases, could now be tested.“There is sudden increase in number of cases at present and it is primarily because of two reasons. First, we have changed strategy and focussing on targeted sampling of high risk groups which include close contacts of positive patients and, second, we are now focussing more on patients of influenza-like illness (ILI) and severe acute respiratory infection (SARI). So, we have more of such cases turning positive,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer.ILI cases are those with symptoms of fever and cough, and SARI are ILI cases that require hospitalisation.“We expect that the trend of high number of cases will continue and it is likely that about 1000 more of such cases can arrive in next fortnight or so. However, once the patients are detected and sent to healthcare facilities, the number of cases will start declining. But we expect that the trend will continue in July as well,” CMO added.According to the data from the state surveillance control room, the district had just five cases in the March. This was followed by 61 cases in April alone and another 239 fresh cases in May alone.In the first 24 days of June, the district registered 784 fresh Covid-19 cases.Sampling teams are now focussing on collecting more samples from containment zones where surveillance measures too have been increased. According to the latest figure, the district has 297 category 1 (having one case) and category 2 (more than one case) containment zones.In March, only 149 samples were taken up followed by 2,729 and 7106 in April and May, respectively. Including data till June 24, the total sampling figure has now reached about 16,500.According to official estimates, the district is presently taking up about 450 sampling per day and focussing on high risk group along with cases of ILI and SARI. At present, about 20-25% cases out of 100 are turning positive which mostly include cases of ILI & SARI while it was about 5-6% till last month, said health officials.Ghaziabad is one of the 11 sensitive districts in the state with respect to rising number of Covid-19 cases.Recently, the district administration had also directed for enhancing the surveillance activities in non-containment zones and also for early detection of ILI and SARI cases. The district magistrate has roped in 3048 block level officers and 237 supervisors who are tasked to carry out house to house survey on the basis of voters’ list.According to the state Covid-19 figures till June 24, the Ghaziabad district stood third after Agra (85) and Meerut (76) in terms of high number of Covid-19 related deaths across the state. However, the discharge rate is also better as Ghaziabad is fourth, after Gautam Budh Nagar, Agra and Kanpur City, among 75 districts which have high discharge rate of Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/targeted-sampling-of-ili-sari-high-risk-patients-leading-to-spike-in-covid-19-cases/story-Oc2VBtmew9EZxpFCNfHuVO.html
25-06-2020||Mumbai||3 cops die, Mumbai Police toll touches 37||Three personnel from the Mumbai Police died of Covid-19 on Thursday, taking the toll of the city police force to 37. The toll of the state police force is 57.Naval Bajaj, joint commissioner of police (administration), confirmed the development to HT. In the past two weeks, 15 personnel have succumbed to the disease in Mumbai, including four deaths reported on June 13.Of the four deceased police personnel, one was an assistant sub-inspector attached to Marine Drive police station. He was undergoing treatment at SevenHills Hospital, Andheri since June 14. He died on Thursday.In the second case, a head constable of Dadar police station, aged 54, died at Hinduja Hospital. He was suffering from hypertension and was battling Covid-19 since May 25, said Viresh Prabhu, additional commissioner of police (Central region).Another 54-year-old constable attached to Samta Nagar police station succumbed to the disease the same morning. Raju Kasbe, senior inspector from Samta Nagar police station said, “He was on leave since June 13 and he started facing health issues on June 19. After he tested positive, he was admitted to Gurunanak Hospital, Bandra (East) on June 22. He felt better on Wednesday but his health condition worsened on Thursday and he succumbed around 7am.”The constable is survived by his wife, son, daughter-in-law and a daughter.The police department said they are yet to ascertain how the three cops contracted the virus.So far, 2,550 policemen from the city police force tested positive for Covid-19. Around 1,750 of them have recovered completely, Bajaj said. In Maharashtra Police, including Mumbai, more than 4,100 policemen have been infected, of whom nearly 3,000 have recovered. Of the 37 deaths of policemen in Mumbai, more than 80% are aged above 50, said a police source.Senior police officers believe that quicker response, setting up four dedicated Covid care centres, raising awareness about sanitisation among cops, strictly following social distancing norms and providing financial and moral support to policemen are some of the key measures for the speedy recovery of policemen.A senior IPS officer, however, said despite all these efforts deaths are continuing unabated and added that while drugs like Remdesivir or Tocilizumab are unavailable to most patients, the department put in extra efforts and arranged for it for the patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-cops-die-mumbai-police-toll-touches-37/story-QU8FnaCZprLZgOIRgRuSyM.html
25-06-2020||Mumbai||City crosses 70,000-case mark; 2,000 frontline BMC staff infected||The city crossed the 70,000 Covid-19 case mark, with 4,000 deaths recorded till Thursday. Frontline workers of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) made up 2,026 of the cases, and 80 casualties. The maximum of these deaths was from the solid waste management (SWM) department, with the second-highest toll from civic-run hospitals and the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB).On Thursday, Mumbai recorded 1,350 fresh cases and 98 deaths. The city’s case tally rose to 70,878, while the death toll touched 4,062. The total number of discharged patients in Mumbai was 39,149, with a recovery rate of 55.23%. Further, active cases stood at 27,659 and the doubling rate is 41 days.“The doubling rate has reached 41 days which was 30 days on June 16. This means that the duration of doubling of a patient in a period of 10 days has increased from 30 to 41 days. At the same time, the average percentage of daily growth in the number of patients is also declining day by day, from 2.30% on June 17 to 1.72%,” the civic body said in a statement.In the case of overall deaths in Mumbai, the toll crossed the 500-mark on May 10. It crossed the 1,000-mark 15 days later on May 25, followed by the 2,000-mark 17 days later on June 12. The city crossed the 4,000-mark within 13 days on Thursday. The mortality rate as of Thursday was 5.72%.According to data released by the general administration department (GAD) of BMC, of the total 80 deaths among frontline workers, 21 are from the SWM department, followed by 16 deaths from civic-run hospitals. Seven deaths were recorded from Sion hospital, three from Cooper Hospital in Juhu, two from Bhabha Hospital in Kurla and one each from GTB Hospital in Wadala, Shatabdi Hospital in Govandi, Rajawadi Hospital and Savitri Bai Phule Maternity Hospital in Malad.Eight deaths were reported from the Mumbai Fire Brigade and seven from the security department of BMC. Nine administrative ward offices of the city reported 16 deaths followed by one each from other departments like markets, mechanical and electrical, stormwater drains, development plan, sewerage, water supply, and maintenance.“There are more deaths in the SWM department because we are on ground continuously and the environment in which the cleaners work is also challenging. Despite giving apparatus like sanitisers, masks, and gloves, many of them do not bother to use them. Also, we have allowed all workers to report on the field and directly go home after work, but many of them may not be going home directly,” said an official from the SWM department.“Many of the cleaners reside in slums and chawls which have common toilets. They also use public transport, hence, the high number of deaths. In the case of health workers, maybe they are less affected because they are more aware of the situation,” the official added.BMC had around two weeks ago announced a compensation of ₹50 lakh to the families of BMC staffers who died due to Covid-19 while discharging their duty. The GAD, in a reminder earlier this week, wrote to all departments of the BMC stating, “As it is necessary to give immediate assistance to the family of the deceased employee, all departments are requested to process the claims as early as possible.”Milind Sawant, joint municipal commissioner of GAD, said, “We are in the process of clearing claims for all the families. Many claims are pending due to paperwork on the part of the family, owing to them being under quarantine. In many cases, the departments are also in the process of furnishing required documents for the claims to be approved by insurance companies.”BMC anticipates that with the procurement of 1 lakh rapid antigen kits, the cases within the civic body can be detected early. “The kits will be used for frontline staff, considering it gives results in 30 minutes. We can detect the cases earlier and can also have frequent testing for elderly staff members,” said a BMC official.Meanwhile, Dharavi, one of the critical hotspots in Mumbai, reported the third-lowest number of cases since the first week of April. On Thursday, only 11 new cases were reported, taking the total count to 2,210, with 81 deaths. On Tuesday, only five cases were reported in Dharavi, the lowest since April, and the second-lowest single-day count of seven was reported on Saturday.Further, on Thursday, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar launched BMC’s ‘Doctor at Your Doorstep’ initiative in south Mumbai, similar to the Rapid Action Plan being launched for areas in the suburbs where more cases are being reported. Through seven mobile clinic vans under ‘Mission Zero’, doctors will conduct door-to-door screening of patients, and swabs from suspected individuals will be collected on the spot. The vans will function in Worli, Antop Hill, Dongri, Wadala, Charni Road, Girgaon, Fort, Colaba, and Dadar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/city-crosses-70-000-case-mark-2-000-frontline-bmc-staff-infected/story-GpFvfPbVGCeDZoVPMZNB3I.html

25-06-2020||Mumbai||Over 50% fliers want to wait six months to a year before resuming air travel: IATA||Gaining passenger confidence in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic will pose a major challenge for the aviation industry, as fliers are reluctant to resume air travel, revealed an international survey conducted by International Air Transport Association (IATA).The results of the survey, which were released by the trade association of world’s airlines as part of a webinar on Thursday, were based on the responses of 4,700 individuals from across 11 countries including India and the US.“More than 50% of air travellers said they would resume air travel only after waiting for at least six months. Whereas, 95% of the respondents said they would resume air travel in a year,” said Amitabh Khosla, IATA’s director, at the webinar titled ‘Restoring confidence in air travel’ organised by US-India Aviation Cooperation Program. “There is a major problem in gaining the passenger confidence at the moment,” he said.Findings also showed that in March, 60% of respondents had said they would return to air travel in a couple of months. This view changed in the second round of the survey, with only 45% of respondents preferring air travel in the next two months.Results showed that 83% of recent travelers in India said they would not consider traveling if it involved a 14-day quarantine period. “To regain passenger confidence in air travel, there is a need to build better travel insurance,” Khosla said.Nishant Pitti, co-founder of Easemytrip.com said current times are very uncertain for the air travel industry, with the majority of passengers travelling only for essential purposes.“With increasing acceptance for the situation, and sentiments turning positive, air travel is expected to recover slowly and move towards normalcy,” said Pitti. “Multiple research organisations are also working towards curing this virus, and travel will revive exponentially once any high-efficacy medicine or vaccine is developed. We are seeing 20% of business back now,” he added.Sabina Chopra, co-founder and chief operating officer of corporate travel and head industry relations of Yatra.com said that with the recommencement of domestic flight operations, their portal has witnessed demand shaping up for flight services on various routes by almost 30% from pre-Covid times.“Apart from popular metro routes, there has been a growth in demand for non-metro routes such as Ranchi and Patna among others. Almost 90% of the bookings are for the next two weeks as travellers are slowly gaining confidence to travel and are being cautious,” said Chopra. “We can expect the travel sector to make a gradual comeback and pick up, especially during the holiday season of October-December,” she said.CSMIA sees increase in flightsPost the resumption of domestic commercial passenger flight operations from May 25, Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) has handled 2,01,258 passengers (1,40,878 departing and 60,380 arriving), with a total of 1,744 domestic flights between May 25 and June 24. These flights were operated by 10 airlines to 34 sectors in the country. The airport saw the highest passenger load capacity on the Mumbai–Delhi route (41,206 passengers), followed closely by Mumbai-Kolkata (22,778 passengers), Mumbai-Varanasi (18,812 passengers) and Mumbai-Patna (17,784 passengers). “With the recent grant by the Maharashtra government to double the commercial passenger flight movements, the airport saw six new sectors added to the existing schedule. The sectors include Trivandrum, Coimbatore, Raipur, Udaipur, Jabalpur, and Jalgaon,” said a CSMIA spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/over-50-fliers-want-to-wait-six-months-to-a-year-before-resuming-air-travel-iata/story-Oxp0XirOQsZHd4M9jZniMJ.html

25-06-2020||Mumbai||Fadnavis claims 1,000 deaths in city not recorded by BMC||Former chief minister and Leader of Opposition in the state government, Devendra Fadnavis has yet again raised a red flag over the Covid-19 related deaths in Mumbai. In a letter to chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, which he also released to the media on Friday, Fadnavis alleged that as many as 1,000 coronavirus deaths that occurred outside hospitals have not been officially recorded yet as Covid-19 fatalities.“As per my information, in the last three and a half months, there are at least 1,000 Covid-19 deaths in Mumbai that have not yet been officially recorded. Ward officers or the concerned officials have not issued death certificates for these cases. So far, 450 such deaths have been identified in the preliminary compilation,” Fadnavis wrote.“Ideally, such deaths must be compiled on that day or within 72 hours, but in this case, even after realising the delay of three months, figures are being compiled and recorded slowly,” he added.Fadnavis alleged that authorities were releasing the death figures in phases in a bid to avoid a spike in Covid-19 deaths but such a strategy was wrong and could prove to be counter-productive for future analysis and assessment of the infection.BMC commissioner Iqbal Chahal denied Fadnavis’ allegations, saying it was “not true” that BMC has not compiled or recorded 1,000 Covid deaths outside of hospitals.“We gain nothing by hiding data on case fatalities. BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) has been transparent when it comes to compiling data so if there are any lacunae or shortcomings, we are working to plug it,” said a senior civic official, on condition of anonymity.Last week, the state government added 1,328 Covid-19 deaths after a review of cases; these included 862 deaths from Mumbai. While Fadnavis and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had alleged that death statistics related to the virus were being manipulated, state and civic authorities said that this was part of the data cleaning and reconciliation process.The state had given medical authorities till June 15 to complete this exercise. Fadnavis, on June 14, had alleged that the BMC had not reported 950-odd Covid-19 deaths.At the time, Bhushan Gagrani, principal secretary, in charge of the Covid-19 control room, had told HT that there had been some negligence and mismatch in data, given the poor flow of information from private hospitals and poor record-keeping by the government.He had said that after realising the lapses, the government had asked all district collectors and civic commissioners to reconcile the figures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/fadnavis-claims-1-000-deaths-in-city-not-recorded-by-bmc/story-2rmnkBBrVq26KQrq8W685M.html

25-06-2020||City||KOTKAPURA FIRING: Ex-SHO arrested, sent to day’s police custody||The special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 police firing incidents, arrested then Kotkapura SHO Gurdeep Singh Pandher by adding Sections 409 (criminal breach of trust by public servant) and 467 (forgery of valuable security, will, etc) of the IPC in first information report (FIR) registered on Pandher’s complaint on October 14, 2015, against the protesters. This is the third arrest in police firing cases in last 10 days. The SIT arrested advocate Sohail Singh Brar and Moga-based car dealer Pankaj Bansal last week in Behbal Kalan firing case. However, it is the first arrest made by the SIT in Kotkapura firing case since suspended inspector general (IG) Paramraj Singh Umranangal was put behind bars on February 19, 2019. The court of duty magistrate Harwinder Singh Sindhia sent Pandher to one-day police custody. Pandher is also named an accused in the FIR number 129 registered in 2018 by the SIT in Kotkapura firing case and he was out on bail. District attorney Rajnish Goyal, who appeared for SIT, told the court that in its investigation report, police had claimed that 10 rounds were fired by five cops in self-defence after protestors attacked them. “But those five cops have already confessed in the court that no shots were fired. Pandher has not submitted those bullets or their empty shells in the armoury; there is no trace of those bullets which are a government property. Even if the bullets were fired, they were not sent to any laboratory for forensic. Pandher had taken these bullets in his possessions and made forged entry in register number 19 to show that these bullets were fired by cops in self-defence. The police remand of the accused is required for further investigation,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kotkapura-firing-ex-sho-arrested-sent-to-day-s-police-custody/story-QenWkNWL6L07aXNFSaMNJN.html
25-06-2020||Chandigarh||ATTACK ON SIKH-AMERICAN STORE OWNER: Rights group calls for hate crime charges against accused||A Sikh-American liquor store owner in Colorado was brutally attacked by a white man who told him “go back to your country”, prompting Sikh civil-rights organisation to call for formal hate crime charges against the assailant.Lakhwant Singh was brutally attacked at the store he owns with his wife in April this year when Eric Breemen entered the store and began harassing the couple, the Sikh Coalition said. Breemen damaged numerous items and repeatedly told the couple to “go back to your country.” When Breemen left the store, Singh followed him outside to take a photo of his licence plate so that he could report the abuse but Breemen struck Singh with his vehicle, throwing him several feet across the parking lot, causing multiple injuries.Following his arrest, Breemen told police that he had attacked an “Arab” man. Breemen’s preliminary hearing date is scheduled for July 24 at which time charges will officially be brought, the civil-rights organisation said.“After repeatedly telling my wife and me to ‘go back to our country,’ my attacker violently rammed his car into me,” Singh said in a statement released by the Sikh Coalition. “He thought I was different, and because of that, believed it was okay to try and kill me. But this community is my home, and that’s why I’m asking the authorities to show they will not stand for such bigotry by filing formal hate crime charges.” The Sikh Coalition said that nearly two months after the attack on Singh, authorities have yet to guarantee that hate crime charges will be brought against the assailant. “The facts of this case are clear, and the failure to file hate crime charges endangers the safety of every Sikh community member in Colorado,” said Amrith Kaur, Sikh Coalition legal director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/attack-on-sikh-american-store-owner-rights-group-calls-for-hate-crime-charges-against-accused/story-WRhHcTudKUc6hb48NBHWKP.html

The case was registered against Saini on May 6 this year.Special public persecutor Sartej Singh Narula said the anticipatory bail granted to Saini on murder charges without imposition of the Section 302 of the IPC in the FIR is not maintainable. He said it was said by the court that if the Section 302 of the IPC is not added to the FIR by June 8, then the interim bail may be wrested.However, the court when questioned the prosecution to produce records if stay has been granted for extending the anticipatory bail period by any of the higher court, the prosecution said no stay has been granted to date.

25-06-2020||City||PM pollution down but ozone levels cross permitted limit during peak lockdown in Dehi-NCR||New Delhi: Concentration of particulate matter and gases such as nitrogen dioxide reduced significantly during the nationwide lockdown but ozone pollution kept increasing and even breached the safe standards in many metro cities, including the national capital, according to an analysis of summer air quality trends by Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).The organisation studied pollution trends of 22 mega cities -- Delhi-NCR (including Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gurugram and Noida), Kolkata, Chennai, Mumbai, Ahmedabad and Bengaluru, among others -- for five months (spring to summer) during January 1-May 31 this year and compared it with the corresponding period of 2019. The focus of the study has been on the period of the lockdown from March 25-May 31. In Delhi, even though overall the severity of ozone pollution was comparatively lower than summer months of 2019 because of the lockdown, the levels still increased and exceeded the standards. This was when other major pollutants such as PM 2.5 and NO2 curves had flattened during the lockdown period, the study said.The CSE studied the number of days when the ozone concentrations exceeded between March 22 and May 31 (lockdown period) this year and for the same period in 2019. The permissible standards (maximum 8 hours average) for ozone are 100 micrograms per cubic metres.“In Delhi, as compared to 2019 when the ozone levels (citywide average) breached the standards on 21 days, in 2020 the levels were breached on four days. However, what is important to note is that the number of days when the levels were breached at least at one monitoring station is high and remains similar for both --- this year (67 days) and in 2019 (68 days). The worst ozone pollution day in Delhi was recorded on May 17,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, CSE.In NCR towns, the city-wide maximum average in Gurugram exceeded the standard on 26 days -- at least one station exceeded the standard on 57 days. The city-wide average in Ghaziabad exceeded the standard on 15 days, with at least one station exceeding on 56 days, the study showed.In Noida, the citywide average exceeded the standard on 12 days; at least one station exceeded on 42 days.In Kolkata, the citywide average exceeded on eight days; at least in one station exceeded on 17 days. Chennai and Mumbai did not register a single day of breached standards at the citywide level, but at least one station in both exceeded the standard on 61 days and five days, respectively. In Ahmedabad, the citywide average exceeded the standard on 43 days.The analysis is based on data sourced from the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) website. The study showed that with all pollutants down during lockdown, ozone, even at a comparatively lower level, became the most prominent pollutant of the day in several cities and led the daily air quality index (AQI).The AQI was led by ozone in Delhi on 10 days (8 of these days were categorised as ‘moderately polluted’) and Gurugram on 14 days (7 days were categorised ‘moderately polluted’ and one as ‘poor’).Vehicular pollution and industrial emissions are major contributors to creation of ozone. It is not directly emitted by any source but is formed by photochemical reactions between oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and other volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and gases in the air under the influence of sunlight and heat, it added.CSE researchers point out that ozone is primarily a sunny weather problem in India that otherwise remains highly variable during the year. It is a highly reactive gas and even short-term exposure (one hour) is dangerous for those with respiratory conditions and asthma. That is why ozone has a short-term standard – one hour and eight hours, as opposed to 24 hours for other pollutants.Also, the study found that ozone pollution is the highest in stations with the lowest NO2 pollution – ozone levels build up in the greenest parts of the city where the NO2 levels are very low. “This is because ozone is formed when NOx, VOCs and gases react with each other under the influence of sunlight and temperature,” she said.She said, for instance, Nehru Nagar near the Lodhi Garden area in Delhi; Colaba in Mumbai, among others, are ozone pollution hot spots.“This pandemic-led change in air quality helped us understand summer pollution. Usually, every year, winter pollution is what draws our attention. This means we need to reduce overall pollution to reduce ozone pollution by intervention such as introduction of BS-VI norms for vehicles, augmentation of public transport, cleaner fuel transition in industries and promoting of activities such as cycling and walking,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pm-pollution-down-but-ozone-levels-cross-permitted-limit-during-peak-lockdown-in-dehi-ncr/story-wv7VI9RqhFjKKUhnoNw87N.html

25-06-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19: Punjab’s first patient treated with plasma therapy recovers||Punjab’s first coronavirus patient to be administered convalescent plasma therapy was discharged from hospital on Thursday after he fully recovered from the disease. The 42-year-old man from Moga was admitted to the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital (GGSMCH), Faridkot, on June 9 with moderate symptoms and respiratory issues a day after he tested positive for Covid-19. He was given the plasma therapy on June 13. GGSMCH principal Dr Deepak Bhatti said the patient was given oxygen therapy as he was having problem in breathing in the beginning and gradually his condition improved with the help of plasma therapy and supportive care.Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS) vice-chancellor Dr Raj Bahadur, who is also adviser to the state Covid-19 response and procurement committee, said the patient’s successful recovery is very encouraging and now more patients will be treated with this therapy.“The Faridkot medical college is one of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR)-approved centres for convalescent plasma therapy trials on Covid-19 patients who require oxygen therapy. It was approved as one in the second week of May. The first patient donated plasma on May 28 and the first one to become eligible to get the therapy was enrolled on June 13,” he said.More donors are required to come forward for plasma therapy clinical trials, he said, adding that they will counsel the cured patients to encourage them to donate blood, he added. THE THERAPYConvalescent plasma therapy involves taking antibodies from cured Covid-19 patients and injecting them in the blood of patients suffering from the disease. The transfusion of plasma is carried out through a machine which separates the plasma from the blood which is then retransferred into the donor. The plasma thus obtained is injected into a sick person. A donor supplies 300-500 ml of plasma and the transfusion process takes 60-90 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-punjab-s-first-patient-treated-with-plasma-therapy-recovers/story-kG2ERQkPcle5KT20K68mHJ.html

25-06-2020||Chandigarh||Cong befooling farmers on central ordinances: Sukhbir||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Thursday came out in support of three ordinances passed recently by the Centre, saying the ruling Congress in Punjab is befooling the farmers on the issue. Addressing mediapersons in Chandigarh, the SAD chief said contrary to the rumours being spread by the Amarinder Singh-led Congress government the minimum support rice (MSP) and assured procurement of wheat and paddy will not be discontinued. He criticised the state government for allegedly trying to mislead farmers by issuing a wrong press statement about the all-party meeting held on Wednesday. He clarified that the statement that a resolution was passed by all parties opposing the ordinances is not true. “It is nowhere mentioned in the ordinances that MSP and assured procurement would end. I assure the farmers that it would continue. In case, there is any deviation at any stage, the SAD will be the first one to oppose it,” he added. “It was the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and some other political leaders who supported the resolution.We said we are ready to get a written assurance on this from the Union agriculture minister and will get an assurance from Parliament. We even agreed to accompany a delegation to the Prime Minister to clarify the doubts. This was misinterpreted by the government in its press release saying we will accompany a delegation led by the CM to get the ordinances withdrawn,” Sukhbir added.“I have asked the CM to clarify that if the provisions of the state APMC Act passed by his government were anti-farmer,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/cong-befooling-farmers-on-central-ordinances-sukhbir/story-8m6d3ifV8Ezk38h77AF5qN.html
25-06-2020||Ranchi||Classes on loudspeaker: Jharkhand teacher beats odds of online learning||“Teachers can change the world” and that is what Shyam Kishore Singh Gandhi, the headmaster of a school in Jharkhand’s Dumka district, has been trying to for his over 200 students, who may be bereft of smartphones but not the willingness to attend classes amid the lockdown.Gandhi has put up several loudspeakers across the Bankathi village where his Upgraded Middle School is located, and classes are being held for two hours every day since April 16, beating the odds of online learning.The students sit near the loudspeakers which have been put up on trees and walls at different locations, and attend the classes.“Louder speakers are put up where the number of students is more. Five teachers and two para teachers teach over the mike from the classroom, Gandhi said.Thousands of schools and colleges across India have switched to online as classrooms remain shut since mid-March amid the coronavirus outbreak. There are 246 students from class 1 to class 8, and 204 of them do not have mobile phones,” Gandhi said.He said the classes start at 10 am daily.“If the students have any doubt or want to ask any question, they can send their queries to me from anyone’s mobile phone and we explain it the next day,” he added.Gandhi said the model is working and students are grasping well what is being taught.The students are receptive and are enjoying the new style of studying, said an elderly villager.Lauding the headmaster, Dumka’s district education officer Poonam Kumari said all the 2,317 government schools here should emulate the model so that the students would not have to struggle to complete the syllabus once the lockdown is lifted.The effort is praiseworthy and all the schools in Dumka district should follow this idea in the interest of the students, Kumari said, adding that she would soon visit the school and the village to learn about the teaching method. Even as students in cities and towns across the country attend classes online, rural areas continue to grapple with the new system due to unsteady connectivity and lack of devices such as smartphones and computers.There have been multiple incidents of suicides among students over not being able to attend online classes.A class 9 student set herself afire in Valancherry in Kerala earlier this month for not being able to attend online classes as she did not have a smartphone and the television in her house was not working. Similar incidents have been reported from several other states, including Assam and West Bengal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/classes-on-loudspeaker-jharkhand-teacher-beats-odds-of-online-learning/story-VttQBnAfFGq8k3WFLd5exJ.html

Farmers depended on family members and co-villagers,” said an officer of state agriculture department.Going by this pace, it is expected the paddy transplant will be over by first week of July, after which basmati’s will begin which is expected to over before July 31.“Although it is a challenging time for agricultural operations amid the pandemic, but Punjab farmers will complete the process by July 31,” said agriculture secretary KS Pannu.According to him, paddy was grown on 72 lakh acres in Punjab last year. “This season, the state agriculture department has decided to shift 6 lakh acres to other crops. In addition, a new method of paddy sowing called direct seeding of rice (DSR) has been recommended by Punjab Agricultural University (PAU) Ludhiana,” adds Pannu.Around 12 lakh acres is expected to be under DSR system this season, with 4,000 specialised DSR machines purchased by farmers and in addition thousands of wheat sowing machines modified to sow paddy by the farmers. “Engineering dept of agriculture department has also trained the farmers on how to modify the machines by spending as little as only Rs 1,000 per machine,” said Pannu, adding that this year the number of mechanised paddy transplantation machines has doubled to about 1,200.President of a faction of a Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) BS Rajewal said that the paddy transplantation was going on in full swing but the cost of transplantation was up from ₹ 3,000 per acre last season to ₹4000-5000 per acre. “The government has left farmers to their fate,” he added, seeking a compensation to cover additional cost.BASMATI VARIEITEIS on 19 LAKH ACRESThis area under aromatic variety of basmati rice is expected to touch 19 lakh acres, an increase of 2 lakh acres from the previous season. Last season it was 17 lakh acres, an increase of 2.5 lakh acres from 2018 when 14.5 lakh acres. Exporters of Punjab’s premium aromatic basmati rice are ecstatic as they have started getting orders from international buyers again even as they suffered a setback in 2018 when hundreds of consignments were returned by the European Union (EU) and countries in the Middle East due to traces of fungicide in the grain. The advance orders are mainly for the 1,121 and 1,718 varieties of the aromatic rice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/punjab-farmers-overcome-labour-woes-complete-60-paddy-transplant/story-xHP2BxSMhlsM7uRPEw2O7L.html

Of the nine people present when the attackers entered the house, she is the eldest among the four unharmed survivors who don’t yet know that they have lost their mothers.“The girl was crying. She said her mother, grandfather and other family members had been attacked. I informed sarpanch Ranjit Singh. When we reached the girl’s house, we found five bodies,” said Jagmohan Singh, the family’s neighbour.Four members of the family and their driver were hacked to death by unidentified people at their house in Kairon village under Patti sub-division of Tarn Taran district in the wee hours of Thursday.Those murdered were Brij Lal, alias Dhattu (60); his two daughters-in-law Amandeep Kaur (24) and Jaspreet Kaur (28); son Daljit Singh, alias Bunty (25); and the family’s driver Gursahib Singh, alias Sabha (35).Amandeep and Jaspreet’s husbands Paramjit Singh, alias Pumma (24) and Bakshish Singh, alias Sonu (30), respectively, are drug-addicts and undergoing treatment at a drug-de-addiction centre in Tarn Taran. Brij’s fourth son Gurjant Singh, alias Janta (27), too, is a drug-addict and faces a drug peddling case. He was not home when the attack occurred.Amandeep’s two daughters Pari and Jasmeet (2), and Jaspreet’s son Amarjit Singh (5) and daughter Khushi (1) are now in the custody of their neighbours.

25-06-2020||City||Ghaggar fury: Patiala, Sangrur brace for monsoon||After the Ghaggar river wreaked havoc by flooding over 100 villages in Patiala and Sangrur districts last year, both district administrations have braced themselves to tame the river in this year’s monsoon.Taking lessons from last year’s devastation, the authorities have swung into action ensuring completion of temporary jacketing and strengthening of the river’s embankments before the water level starts rising in catchment areas due to rain.In July 2019, agricultural fields spread over 30,000 acre in Patiala and Sangrur got submerged in Ghaggar water, while the villagers residing in the vicinity of the river had to shift their belongings and livestock to safer places.In the absence of firm embankments and other flood control measures, the river makes situation worrisome every year, especially during monsoon.Sangrur deputy commissioner (DC) Ramvir said, “Repair and strengthening projects worth Rs 7 crore are underway in district for Ghaggar and other seasonal water channels.” He added that all weak points of the river have been strengthened by the administration with the help of MGNREGA workers.Harjit Singh, sarpanch of Sangrur’s Phulad, which witnessed 150ft long breach last year, said, locals and administration are regularly trying to strengthen the banks of Ghaggar, however, work has been stalled since a few days due to strike by the MGNREGA workers.Patiala DC Kumar Amit said special meetings with top officials of drainage and irrigation department have convened to tap sensitive points in Ghaggar.“Work related to strengthening of embankments and stone bedding especially in Sanaur and Patran is on. Moreover, we have stacked over 70,000 sandbags to deal with sudden breaches or other emergency situations,” the Patiala DC said.The areas include Samana, Patran, Devigarh, Sanaur and Ghanaur in Patiala, and Khanauri and Moonak in Sangrur. These areas had seen huge damages of life and property due to floods in 1988, 1993, 2010 and 2019.Superintending engineer of the drainage department Devinder Singh said that the work is going on round-the-clock as earlier it got delayed due to lockdown.GHAGGAR CHANNELISATION PROJECT IN A LIMBOThe project related to channelisation of Ghaggar river has became the prey of dispute between Punjab and Haryana.Under the project, the river will be jacketed up to 40km from Khanauri to Karail in Sangrur. The first phase of the project, from Khanauri to Makrour Sahib (covering 22.45km), was completed in 2010.However, the second phase of 17.5km from Makror Sahib to Karail (which touchd the neighbouring state), has been stalled after the Haryana government refused to give a no objection certificate to the Punjab government to completing the project.Harpal Singh, a resident of Makraur Sahib village, said the breach has become a routine affair for villages around Ghaggar. Once there is a breach, it destroys crop in 12-15 villages, he said.“The Punjab and Haryana governments should resolve the matter amicably and find a permanent solution to the problem,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ghaggar-fury-patiala-sangrur-brace-for-monsoon/story-8nqAmYnjdbWhD3cRxSGkCL.html

25-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh unlikely to start antigen testing despite ICMR advisory||Even though the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has again advised all states and union territories to scale up testing for Covid-19 by deploying combination of various tests, the UT health department has said it will stick to real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) test.In this type of test, the blood samples are analysed for antibodies using an enzyme-based laboratory test that detects and quantifies antibodies in blood that will determine a past infection due to the virus.A senior UT official said that the three laboratories established in Chandigarh had the capacity to conduct 1,000 tests in a day, enough to cater to the number of people being diagnosed with symptoms and being recommended testing. “Besides, there are issues related to the sensitivity and specificity of the antigen testing kits, which have been evaluated to be between 50.6% and 84%, and 99.3% and 100%, respectively,” an official requesting anonymity said.ICMR has said that those who test negative on the rapid antigen kit must be retested using RT-PCR given the antigen test’s low sensitivity, while those who test positive needn’t get a retest. “That’s why we are totally focusing on RT-PCR testing when the ultimate result has to be provided by it,” the official added.UT director, health services, Dr G Dewan said the UT had ample capacity for gold standard RT-PCR testing. “The testing for symptomatic patients with influenza-like illness and/are severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) are being tested using RT-PCR. The special emphasis is on patients with comorbidities, for whom the testing capacity is enough. Still, [ICMR’s] proposal is being examined,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-unlikely-to-start-antibody-testing-despite-icmr-advisory/story-OMe3kGZPqGSFlrf3QLMDVK.html

25-06-2020||Lucknow||Ad hoc coaching in 32 disciplines to start in phased manner||Ad hoc coaching in as many as 32 different disciplines, including 28 Olympic sports is all set to start soon across the state but in the phased manner as Uttar Pradesh Sports Directorate has divided them into three different categories after over 100 days of lockdown in the country due to the pandemic COVID19.The date of the resumption of sports activities are yet to be announced, first to kick off the training would be the A category disciplines like archery, athletics, badminton, gymnastics, squash, table tennis, tennis, weightlifting, powerlifting, fencing, shooting, soft tennis, cycling, rowing, kayaking and canoeing, whereas the disciplines in the B category include basketball, cricket, football, handball, hockey, volleyball and netball. The C category has disciplines mostly the contact sports like swimming, boxing, judo, kho-kho, kabaddi, wrestling, taekwondo, wushu and karate.“We have fianlised the disciplines to start with but the coaching would begin in phased manner. We aren’t going to compromise with the heath of the sportspersons at the time when the pandemic corona virus has made things difficult for everyone,” UP’s director sports, RP Singh said on Wednesday.“We have yet not finalized the resumption day of the sporting activities across the state, but start of the training/coaching would help the ad hoc coaches in those particular disciplines get into action,” he said, adding, “All the centres have been told to strictly follow the norms of thermo scanning, social distancing, hand sanitization and also the sanitization of instruments for the use in the disciplines.”It is learnt that much before finalizing the list of disciplines UP Sports Directorate discussed the issue with the health departments and even sought the opinion of all its offices across the state. “Only after seeing the success result of resumption of category A sports, we will start the coaching/training of B category sports, but the resumption of C category sports would come at the last. All the contact sports are in C category and we will take a final call on these disciplines only when things returned to full normalcy.”Singh, however, said that to monitor the entry and exit of the trainees/sportspersons, registration of all is a must. “No one would be allowed to get trained at the stadium without having registration as keeping everyone’s record is a must in this situation.”It is learnt that 400 plus ad hoc coaches across the state are eagerly waiting for the resumption of sports activities since march 25, which was the last day of their stint last season. Technically, their 11-month tenure contract had to be resumed from April 1, but the lockdown brought everything to standstill and since they have been struggling for remuneration, thus facing the worst financial crisis of their lives.“It’s good that training/coaching are due to be resumed soon though in phased manner. This would surely make things better for us as we have been struggling to manage things at home,” said an ad hoc coach on condition of anonymity. “Even I had to borrow funds from one of my friends to mange milk for my one-year old daughter,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/ad-hoc-coaching-in-32-disciplines-to-start-in-phased-manner/story-wlk0sTOCAKXDuUpSHkcGdI.html

According to the Navi Mumbai Police department, the first information reports (FIRs) registered in April and May dropped to 211, as against the 891 cases filed during these two months in 2019.The police have attributed the decline in the crime rate to empty roads, restrictions in movement and heavy police presence on roads. They have also claimed that the fear of contracting Covid-19 has kept criminals at bay.“There is heavy police presence on the streets and regular patrolling is being conducted even on internal roads. Criminals are aware that they will be caught immediately if they commit offences,” said Ashok Dudhe, deputy commissioner of police, zone 2.The police however, have said that with the emerging financial crisis, the department is expecting a spurt in robberies in the coming days. “Overall, crimes, especially vehicle thefts and street crimes have reduced. In the first phase of unlocking, we have noticed some cases of robberies and vehicle thefts, owing to the relaxation of restrictions and movement of people,” said Pravin Patil, deputy commissioner of police, crime branch.For the first time in police records, there had been no reports of chain snatchings and daylight robberies in Navi Mumbai for two consecutive months. The robberies have also reduced significantly, with only two cases being reported in April and May, as against the 23 reported last year. A slump has also been witnessed in the break-ins reported at night. Overall, between April and May this year, only 14 burglaries were committed, while the same period had seen 67 cases last year.Dudhe said that there has been a drop in the crimes against women also, owing to the fear of speedy arrests. During the two months of complete lockdown, 11 rape and 19 molestations cases were registered. Last year in April and May, 30 cases of rape and 41 molestations had been reported.“As 95% of offenders in cases of rapes are known to the women, a majority of people are also mindful of the nakabandis in their vicinity,” said Dudhe.Though vehicle thefts continue to be a reason for worry, the police have said that the cases have come down to 41 from 101 thefts reported in April and May last year.According to the police data, 47 of the 94 cases registered in April had been solved, at a detection rate of 50%. In the same period last year, the police had solved 272 of the total 410 cases registered (66% detection rate). In May, the detection rate had been 63%, as 74 of the total 117 cases were solved. This is a rise from the 53.8% detection rate recorded last year for the same month, with 259 of 481 cases detected.“While investigations had slowed down a little owing to reduced staff, we are still managing and focusing on urgent matters. Heinous crimes are on top priority and the lockdown is not being taken as an excuse to not investigate cases,” said a Panvel police station officer requesting anonymity.Earlier, the state had decided to release some prisoners to curb the spread of Covid-19 in prisons but senior police officers said that the development did not have a major effect on the crime trend in Navi Mumbai.“Local police stations have been tasked with the monitoring of undertrials or convicts who have been out on bail or parole and we are following up on them regularly. Those with criminal records know they will immediately be arrested if they commit a fresh crime,” said an officer from NRI police station requesting anonymity.

Today, Indian democracy is strengthened but the evil of corruption still prevails,” he said. He also paid tributes to his comrades who were with him in Nahan Jail during emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/45-years-of-emergency-it-was-a-black-chapter-in-history-of-indian-democracy-says-shanta-kumar/story-539CjMTaxbd3qhEfSVeoSK.html

25-06-2020||Chandigarh||HT Salutes: J&K’s microbiologist keeps gruelling hours||Leading the battle against the coronavirus pandemic from the forefront, microbiologist Dr Junaid Ahmad works round-the-clock to ensure maximum samples are collected and tested. Each morning, sharp at 8am, Dr Junaid Ahmad enters the sprawling Baramulla Degree College campus, where a newly inaugurated Sports Complex has been converted into a Covid-19 hospital. Men, women and children, who have already lined up, wait for their turn anxiously as the 35-year-old doctor and his four-member team prepare to collect their samples.The team collects around 200 samples a day from morning to late afternoon. The centre has so far collected 6,758 samples, the highest for any single centre in the Union Territory, which is leading the country in the number of tests conducted. “It is a matter of routine for me now to work from 8am till the evening and at times I leave at midnight depending on the workload,” says Ahmad, as he collects the sample of a young man from Khanpora locality where three elderly people recently died due to Covid-19. The area has been sealed.“It takes a couple of days for the reports to arrive. If the report returns negative, the person is discharged and incase the report is found positive, the patient is straightway admitted to the Covid-centre,” the young doctor said, adding that around 40 positive patients had been admitted to the centre the day the interview was conducted. Baramulla district has 562 Covid-19 patients and almost all patients’ samples were collected at this centre.Though being head of the department collecting samples is not part of Ahmad’s duties he does it nonetheless to boost the morale of his staff.“Everyday we collect around 200 samples that are then dispatched to SKIMS laboratory. The positive patients are under our constant vigil for 14 days and then on the 14th and 15th day two more samples are collected and if found negative the patient is discharged with certain ICMR guidelines,” he said.PPE’s CHANGED TWICE A DAYIn the sweltering heat, Ahmad has to change PPE sets at least twice or thrice in a single day besides shuttling between the Covid-centre and the Government Medical Hospital laboratory.“I have to oversee collection of samples, line listing and draft plans with the head of medicine,” he says. ‘’Our team takes care of triple packing, para-filming and putting samples in vaccine carriers.We maintain 20 degree icepacks and also prepare the viral transport medium (VTMs) every night hours before the sampling process begins,’” he says. HASN’T SEEN FAMILY IN THREE MONTHS Ahmad has not gone home for the past three months. His house is 60 kilometers away from his centre and he has been putting up at a hotel close to the hospital. His only contact with his family, comprising his wife, eight-year-old daughter, seven-months-old son and aged parents, is phone.“My father is diabetic and has a stent in his heart. He is also hypertensive. I stay away from them as I don’t want them to face any complication,” he says. “On Eid, which is our biggest festival, I remained in the Covid centre with my team.”Ahmad joined GMC Baramulla, as assistant professor and became head of the department t in 2018. “The saddest day for me was when 62 samples tested positive from this centre on a single day and I knew some of the patients could die,” he said, while adding that each day brings new hope for Covid-19 patients. “Only last week, I discharged 56 patients after they all tested negative. For me, the patients and their families, it was a joyous moment.’’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ht-salutes-j-k-s-epidemiologist-keeps-gruelling-hours/story-AyLhWCG01ZBRdUeEuPh3BP.html
25-06-2020||Delhi||Tablets at Covid hospital to allow patients to make video calls: Delhi CM||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday launched a video call facility for coronavirus patients admitted at the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash (LNJP) hospital here to talk to their loved ones.LNJP was declared a Covid-19 hospital on March 17 and since then, it has successfully treated 2,700 coronavirus patients and sent them home. It is the only Covid-19 hospital in the country with 2,000 beds, he said. The chief minister said that till now, relatives of coronavirus patients were not able to talk to them, but that issue has been resolved.“We have installed tablets in coronavirus wards and at a counter outside. These can be used by patients and their relatives for video calling,” Kejriwal said.After the launch, Kejriwal used the facility to talk to a few patients admitted to the hospital’s Covid-19 ward. Lauding LNJP doctors, the chief minister said the medics don’t go home or meet their family members for days on end fearing that the infection may spread.“All doctors here have worked really hard. You can imagine how tough it is to work wearing PPE kits in this heat,” he said, adding the administration is responsible for shortcomings, if any, and not the healthcare workers.“We (government) stand like a rock behind you. If you face any problem, we are there with you. We will work together to improve the facilities. Obviously, there is a scope for improvement,” Kejriwal told the doctors.Plasma therapy is being used on a large scale in LNJP, which has reduced the death rate among Covid-19 patients substantially.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tablets-at-covid-hospital-to-allow-patients-to-make-video-calls-delhi-cm/story-s6KUMVE8YDnaS2bnYMcTKP.html

They have also demanded that the academic year should be extended by four months as their research work has been affected.Due to the rise in the number of people infected with Sars-Cov-2 virus which causes the Covid-19 (coronavirus) many students have returned to their hometown when the lockdown was announced.“We are now getting calls from SPPU to resume our research projects, but how can we come when the hostels and mess on the campus are closed. I cannot afford to rent private accommodation,” said Nandkumar Hange, a PhD student.“The university should resume the hostel facility in building No. 9, a hostel for PhD students, and make sure social distancing norms are followed in the campus. All necessary precautions must be in place only then we can return and resume our research work,” said Hange.“Many of us also fear of getting infected with the virus as the number of Covid-19 cases are on a rise in Pune,” said Hange.Pune city has reported 13,153 active cases of Covid-19 and 528 deaths as of June 23, according to the health department of Pune Municipal corporation (PMC).Due to the three-month lockdown PhD students were not able to complete their research work for the thesis papers. They had to study the research study materials which is accessible only in SPPU libraries.Prafulla Pawar, registrar, SPPU, said, “Students are not allowed to come to university.

25-06-2020||Pune||Monsoon preparedness: Flood alarm saver will be a life-saver||Salim Shaikh and Victor Sangle, both, on September 25, 2019, drove towards the Bairobha nallah bridge linking Camp with Wanowrie. The city was under a torrential downpour. The nallah had burst its banks and the bridge was under water. Neither knew of the scenario. Both drove into the flood. Neither survived. The flash floods of 2019 claimed 26 lives in Pune. Two families, nine months on, believe the lives of Salim and Victor could have been saved ‘Nobody from our family uses the bridge anymore’Software professional Salim Shaikh was employed with nVidia Software. He was returning home from work on September 25 and drove towards Wanowrie, in his way to NIBM road, where he resided.Shaikh was unaware the bridge at Wanowrie was engulfed by the overflowing Bairobha nallah, courtesy the 100mm of rain the city had received in two hours; and which had not yet eased.Shaikh, driving his car, never made it across the bridge.Salim Shaikh’s body was found in Ahmednagar District, some 95 kms from Pune. Sangale family had searched his body for many days after the incident but with no avail.The family had received the compensation from district collector’s office on completion of the official procedures.Taher Shaikh, Salim Shaikh’s brother, said “Ever since the incident, our family has decided not to commute from the Bairobha nallah bridge ever again. None of family members travel via that route. There is a need for strong safety railings at the bridge and there should have been a protective wall at the bridge. After the incident, we expected the government to increase safety standards at the bridge.”Zakir Khan, a friend of Shaikh, said “We have been demanding that Bairobha nallah be brought under round the clock CCTV surveillance during all seasons and a flood-alert system (automatic) be installed, where an SMS alert is sent directly to the fire brigade and the police. Currently, the bridge is unsafe and needs lot of safety measures to be completed. There are no street lights on the bridge and there is only one light installed at one end of the road which is inadequate.”‘Every day, we still hope for news’Victor Sangle was the die-hard survivor. By the age of 26, he had survived cancer. Had had survived an amputation and lived a full life with a prosthetic limb.Prior to September 25, 2019, he had just returned from a bicycle expedition in Arunachal Pradesh.On the evening of September 25, he drove in his car from Kalyani nagar, where he stayed, towards Wanowrie. He was going to see his cousins who lived there.The rain was torrential. Pune had already received 100mm in two hours.As Sangle drove towards Wanowrie what he did not know was that the Bairobha nallah had breached its banks and a bridge connecting Camp to Wanowrie was under water.Sangle drove through it and as far as the official records of the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), the Pune fire brigade and the Pune police go, he never made it.Victor Sangle driving his car, was washed away.Nine months since, no rescue agency has been unable to recover his body. The search, involving the NDRF and the fire brigade, extended 200 kilometres along the Mula-Mutha river, into which the Bairobha nallah flows. Prashant Ranpise chief fire officer said, “According to our records, he is still missing. He could not be traced despite the search.”Sangle’s immediate family declined an interview with HT, but said this much, “Every day, we still hope for news.”Rajesh Bansode, an extended relative of the Sangle family said that last month a call came in from an unknown person who claimed to have Sangle’s documents, like the Aadhar card.“However, there has been no response from the said number since. How these unidentified people called the family after such a long time needs investigation, as it is very suspicious. Because of the Covid situation, it became difficult for us to go to the police. The call came in from the Beed district of Maharashtra,” said Bansode.He went back for the dog... ‘came under the wall and was washed away’Fifteen-year-old Rohit Amle lived in the Ganga Teerth Society, Tangewala colony, Sahakarnagar. The Ambil Odha (stream) flowed by the society. On September 25, 2019, the Ambil Odha was not flowing; it had burst its banks and caused a flash flood. Rohit Amle was about to get away, when he remembered his pet dog was still in the house. He went back to save the dog. As he was exiting the society, the wall between the odha and the society collapsed . Rohit Amle and the pet dog, both perished in the flood waters.Rukmini Shinde (53), Rohit’s is grandmother, recounts the tragic events. “He had been staying with us ever since my daughter passed away. He did not inform us and came under the wall and was washed away. This is indeed tragic and we have received compensation. It was his birthday on June 18. It is a very painful experience we will have to undergo it for our lifetime,” she said. Rohit was a Class X student of Vidya Vikas School. Swapnil Shinde, his uncle, said, “We have very fond memories to share. Rohit was creative and intelligent. We did not expect that he will be no more with us.”PCB blames PMCAmit Kumar, chief executive officer (CEO) of the Pune Cantonment Board (PCB), under whose jurisdiction the Bairobha nallah falls, said “The PMC had committed to make the bridge safe for commuters and it was given permission to carry out the repair and reconstruction work. However, things on the ground are different and the PMC must honour its commitment made to the board. The onus of repairs and other important things lie with the corporation,” he said.Covid closure for monsoon?The Bairobha nallah bridge in question has been in and out of quarantine since the Covid-19 pandemic began. Currently it is inaccessible, again, given its proximity to areas under lockdown. With the monsoon here, it may well be that no one will be allowed to access the bridge for some time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monsoon-preparedness-flood-alarm-saver-will-be-a-life-saver/story-DvxXB40Uynv15akHB62z3L.html
25-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Ex-servicemen Corporation under scanner, CM orders probe into allegations of irregularities||The functioning of the Punjab Ex-servicemen Corporation (PESCO) has come under the scanner as chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh has marked an inquiry after receiving complaints regarding financial irregularities.PESCO was founded in 1978 to uplift ex-servicemen, war widows and their dependents in Punjab. PESCO has the distinction of being the first ex-servicemen corporation of India.An official, on condition of anonymity, said, “Several complaints have reached the chief minister (CM) about financial irregularities in PESCO. Being an ex-serviceman himself, the CM is concerned and has marked an inquiry into the matter.”Special principal secretary to the CM Gurkirat Kirpal Singh, who is also the secretary of defence services, confirmed the development and said the CM had tasked special secretary Moneesh Kumar with holding an inquiry. “Further course of action will be decided once the report is submitted,” he said. As per the PESCO Act the retirement age of employees is 58 years. The act allows the board to allow an extension for a period not exceeding two years, in exceptional circumstances, to an employee who is competent and physically fit. “However, there are several employees at the corporation whose age exceeds 60 years. In fact, some of the employees are nearing 70 years of age and are still working. The board has recruited them on a contractual basis, claiming that retirement rules were not applicable to contractual staff,” the official said. “The services of employees of the corporation are governed by Punjab Ex-Servicemen Corporation (Service) Regulations, 1993. These regulations are applicable to full time officers or employees of the corporation appointed on regular basis, and officers or employees employed on contractual basis subject to the terms of the said contract. How can the PESCO frame its own rules and regulations or overstep the PSECO Act or Punjab government’s financial rules?” asked the officer. “No clearance for providing salaries to contractual staff has been taken from the finance department or any local auditor of the Punjab government,” the official said. PESCO (Service) Regulations, 2012, clearly specify that the financial controller of the corporation has to be a qualified chartered accountant. “It is shocking to see that an ex-army officer who doesn’t have the basic qualification of a chartered accountant has been serving as the financial controller of this multi-crore corporation created for the welfare of ex-servicemen,” the official said.‘REPORT HAS ALMOST BEEN FINALISED’Moneesh Kumar, who is probing the matter, refused to share the results of the probe as the inquiry had been personally marked by the CM. “I have almost finalised the report. I will submit it in a day or two,” he said.Captain MPS Rattan (retd), who raised the issue, said “Punjab has highest number of ex-servicemen. Why are only a select few getting the chance to work after the age of 60? A financial audit is needed.” PESCO chairperson major general (retd) Amritpal Singh said the appointment of contractual staff and those above the age of 60 fell within the ambit of rules. It is an issue regarding interpretation of laws. “There is an inquiry marked and we are waiting for it as it will clear certain rules and regulations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-ex-servicemen-corporation-under-scanner-cm-orders-probe-into-allegations-of-irregularities/story-Y44vVChrhWq2gAA0eN1XMI.html

25-06-2020||Lucknow||Baby gharials return to Yamuna after almost a decade||Much to the astonishment of environmentalists and wildlife enthusiasts, the ghariyals of the Chambal river have chosen in a big way to nest and breed in the Yamuna, one of the most polluted rivers.The ghariyals nested and laid eggs in Etawah, near 30 km upstream of Yamuna at Bhaupura. On June 15, 43 juveniles emerged and swam in the river with the adults, drawing massive crowds from the villages.Curious onlookers said two of the hatchlings died and 24 could still be seen on the banks and in the river.Regional forest director Rajesh Kumar Verma said this was a heartening development. In order to protect the ghariyals, a team of forest guards along with volunteers from villages was deployed for round the clock monitoring.Rajeev Chauhan, conservation officer with Wildlife Institute of India said it was surprising the ghariyals were breeding in the Yamuna. Way back in 2011, the ghariyals ventured in the Yamuna near Haraur village for breeding for the first time but by and large the amphibians remained in their natural habitat, the Chambal.“The first reason that comes to my mind is that the lockdown has improved the water quality of Yamuna so the ghariyals have started moving to it in big numbers,” Chauhan said.This was a strong indicator that ghariyals had chosen the Yamuna as another natural habitat and the river could be a cornerstone in conserving bio-diversity if the work to clean it gained pace, he said.Even last year, ghariyals were seen in the Yamuna for breeding for the second time but on a much smaller scale, at a place where Yamuna and Chambal meet in Etawah near Sumer Singh fort.This year their number had considerably risen, said experts. They said there had been one sighting of ghariyals nesting in Yamuna downstream in Sajeti of Kanpur rural.After this discovery, the wildlife experts and enthusiasts have started a detailed study on this phenomenon with the help of their volunteers who are keeping a watch on ghariyals of Yamuna. Forest sub-inspector Tabish Ahmad said the experts had made the Bhaupura village their base to study and they were seeking help of the villagers.“When I was first told about this I could not believe it. I stared when I saw the ghariyals swimming with juveniles. This is one of the best things to have happened in Yamuna and Etawah,” said Ahmad.In 2007, an unspecified disease had claimed lives of more than 100 ghariyals in Chambal and their bodies were found in the Yamuna. Many experts from different countries conducted comprehensive researches, which included tagging transmitters, to find out of the cause and to help them in survival. One set of experts had blamed liver cirrhosis caused by high pollution level and another thought it was hunting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greens-thrilled-as-chambal-ghariyals-breed-again-in-yamuna/story-GxeP82OBYG9jirZYbnWYbN.html

25-06-2020||Kolkata||Guardians protest in Kolkata, demand school fee waiver||Parents of students of different private schools in Kolkata have staged a demonstration, demanding 50 per cent waiver of tuition fees.Around 100 parents, under the banner of the United Guardians’ Association, staged the demonstration at College Square on Wednesday.They also reached out to the Chief Minister’s Office, demanding her intervention on the issue if the private schools do not heed to their pleas.“We demand that the school authorities take only the tuition fees from guardians this year and waive other charges such as transport, development and electricity,” said Supriyo Bhattacharya, the convenor of the association.“We also demand that the schools should charge only 50 per cent of the tuition fee and the schools that have taken the full amount already should return the half of it,” he said.Bhattacharya said if the demands are not met, the guardians will start a bigger movement. “Guardians are not in a position to pay full fees due to the economic hardships caused by the lockdown,” he said.Many guardians also staged protests in front of a private school in the Ranikuthi area in south Kolkata.Demonstrations also took place outside a school in the Chandni Chowk area in central Kolkata. Besides, some parents also protested against fee hike at a school in Durgapur in Paschim Bardhaman district.There has been a series of protests in the past one month against hike in school fees in different parts of the city, and the state.Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has asked private schools not to hike fees, considering the difficulties faced by guardians in the present situation.Education Minister Partha Chatterjee also warned of strict action if any school went ahead with the decision to hike fees.BJP state president Dilip Ghosh said the government should intervene and resolve the issue. “The guardians have been forced to hit the roads as they have been pushed to the wall,” he said.When contacted, several private schools said it was not possible to provide any such waiver in fees.“We were conducting online classes throughout this lockdown. Our teachers are working from home through laptops provided by the school. How can we reduce the tuition fees? We didn’t hike it this year but it is not possible to lessen the fees by half,” said the principal of a south Kolkata boys’ school.The principal of a school in Belgharia said, “The drivers of our school buses, the security staff, the maintenance staff cannot go without pay just because classes are not being held.” “The guardians knew very well they have to pay a particular amount while admitting their wards. Now, if all of them demand waivers how can that be possible? We can consider exceptional cases on humanitarian grounds,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/guardians-protest-in-kolkata-demand-school-fee-waiver/story-rK8V0kBe3HGXyJRu1mEWDP.html
25-06-2020||Patna||Heavy rains eroding earthen diversions on Karmnasha river||The continuous heavy rains have increased the danger of a traffic halt on the GT Road (NH 2), connecting seven states, as the two earthen diversions on Karmnasha river are eroding.Water level in the hilly river is rising after the constant rain spells in its catchment area. Meanwhile, the National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) is yet to construct the temporary steel bridge planned as an alternative for commute during rainy season.Adding to the problem, the inter-state truckers and passenger vehicles are already facing heavy traffic jam due to overloaded sand trucks being illegally operated on the bridge.The problem started on December 28 when three out of total five pillars of the bridge on Karmnasha, demarcating the borders of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, started developing cracks. The middle pillar was severely damaged as its both shoulders were cracked.“The 10-year-old four-lane bridge was constructed by PCL Company and was handed over to the NHAI in 2009,” Rajan Chaturvedi, NHAI toll point in-charge said.“The illegal sand overloading business rampant on the GT road from Bihar to UP is the main cause behind the damage of bridge,” an official from NHAI technical team arrived to access the damage, had said.Traffic was reinstated on the NH after 10 days when two earthen diversions were made on both sides of the damaged bridge.The NHAI also started construction of a 150m long and 8.5m wide two-lane steel bridge with an estimated cost of ₹11 crore to maintain the traffic in the rainy season when the strong river current would wash away the earthen diversions.This all was under alternative arrangements before the NHAI could repair or replace the regular four-lane bridge.NHAI technical manager Nagesh Kumar said that the work on steel bridge and approach roads on its both sides was going on war footing and was in the last stage.Talking about the illegal sand transportation, Kumar said,“Cases have been registered against nine sand loaded truck owners who had intentionally narrowed the lane near the entrance to cross the bridge during the night to dodge the UP police strict drive against overloading.”“The work on the bridge will be completed and it will be opened for traffic on July 1, if the weather situations are favourable,” he added.Meanwhile, heavy jam continued on seventh consecutive day on the southern lane of the NH approaching Uttar Pradesh.The traffic extended from Karmnasha to Mohania and thousands of trucks and other vehicles, including ambulances were seen struck in the 20km long jam.Meanwhile, the NHAI officials were trying to resolve the jam with help of local police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/heavy-rains-eroding-earthen-diversions-on-karmnasha-river/story-8IMPGl5gaAwQtexWFJLMnJ.html

Tossing social distancing norms, a large crowd gathered in support of the SAD workers.COMPLAINANT SAYS SHE DOES NOT RECOGNISE ACCUSEDThe complainant, Sukhdarshan Kaur of Jangpur, said she did not recognise the accused - Jasdeep Singh Jassa or Akali worker Gurpreet Singh Gopi - nor had she named them in the complaint.However, Ludhiana rural district police chief Viveksheel Soni said the complainant had submitted the nicknames of the accused in her complaint and also signed the statement.PROBE LAUNCHED“Now, the complainant has retracted her statement. The matter is being probed,” said Soni. Dakha seputy superintendent of police Gurbans Singh Bains has been charged with the investigation.Ayali alleged that the case was concocted by station house officer (SHO) Prem Singh. He accused the police of working at the behest of the Congress government.“Nearly nine months have passed but no headway has been made in the case against Grewal for shooting Gopi on the thigh while the worker tried to stop the leader from capturing the booth. Police are using cheap tactics so that Gurpreet withdraws his complaint,” said Grewal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/criminal-case-against-two-sad-workers-triggers-outage-in-dakha/story-Svx349kbpY69tSVbhRfj7N.html

25-06-2020||Lucknow||After Operation ‘patal’, police eye arms manufacturing gangs||After the recovery of large number of illegal firearms and ammunition during 48 hours of operation ‘patal’, the Prayagraj police are now planning to target illegal arms manufacturing units and weapon smugglers.The police seized around 70 countrymade firearms and 84 live ammunition during the drive while arresting around 60 criminals who were in possession of them during the two-day campaign.All of the recovered firearms were single shot pistols or ‘katta’ and none of the police teams claimed to have seized semi automatic .32 bore and 9 mm pistols which are smuggled from Munger district of Bihar and Khandwa district of Madhya Pradesh.During last few years, semi automatic handguns have become quite popular among criminals and even warring student groups have been found using them frequently, said a crime branch official.While a local made ‘katta’ is available for Rs 1000 to 5000 depending on its quality, semi automatic pistols are sold by weapon smugglers for Rs 20,000 to 40,000 a piece. Moreover, good quality single shot pistol or ‘katta’ were also brought from Munger into Prayagraj and adjoining regions for sale, official added.With easy availability of Munger and MP made pistols, the local illegal firearms manufacturers suffered a setback as although these pistols were costly, they were reliable and a status symbol among criminals and shooters.However, the business of local illegal firearms manufacturers and suppliers flourished once again after Special Task Force and Crime Branch teams, launched a massive crackdown against persons involved in smuggling of firearms from Munger and Madhya Pradesh.During last few years STF teams busted many gangs involved in illegal firearms smuggling and arrested dozens of their members. Besides, action taken by crime branch and local police teams break the backbone of the network of organised firearm smugglers.An STF official said not only in Prayagraj but teams have been following illegal firearms smugglers across the state. Although some of the gangs may be still active most of them have been busted and their members put behind bars.As Munger made-pistols were becoming scarce, local firearms manufacturers take it as an opportunity to regain their old market. As rocky terrains of trans-Yamuna were ideal for hideouts, many gangs started manufacturing of illegal firearms in rocky areas. At-least five illegal firearms manufacturing units were busted in Ghoorpur and adjoining areas around a year ago by crime branch and local cops. Huge cache of ‘katta’ and some locally made revolvers along with tools and equipments used in manufacturing them were recovered from them. Questioning from them exposed that they were supplying the firearms to local criminals.SSP Abhishek Dixit said although operation ‘patal’ was a 48 hours drive, police teams worked with dedication in recovery of firearms. Now focus will be laid on busting illegal firearms manufacturing units across the district. Efforts will be stepped up to trace and seize the remaining semi automatic pistols in the hands of criminals, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/after-operation-patal-police-eye-arms-manufacturing-gangs/story-2sCENX1OgrMDuD0YN140uJ.html

25-06-2020||Ranchi||BJP demands Jharkhand minister’s resignation for ‘managing tender’||BJP’s legislature party leader Babulal Marandi on Wednesday demanded chief minister (CM) Hemant Soren to dismiss his cabinet colleague, rural development minister Alamgir Alam, and his Barhait assembly representative Pankaj Mishra for allegedly managing a government tender for the settlement of toll under Bardharwa Nagar Panchayat in Sahebgunj district.The controversy surrounding the tender came to the fore after an audio containing telephonic conversation between minister Alam, CM’s representative Mishra and a Pakur-based contractor Shambhu Nandan Kumar went viral. In the audio, Alam and Mishra were allegedly mounting pressure on the contractor to quit from participating in the bidding process.When the contractor didn’t budge and went to participate in auction on June 22, a mob, allegedly guided by Mishra, entered in the Nagar Panchayat building, pulled the contractor out and thrashed him.Following this, contractor Shambhu lodged an FIR against Alam, Mishra and nine others. Two counter FIRs were also registered against the contractor.Marandi, in a tweet, asked the CM to dismiss Alam and remove Mishra.Marandi said, “A minister is supposed to establish the rule of law and protect the interest of government’s revenue. He is not expected to misuse the power to manage tenders causing loss to the exchequer.”“Since the matter is directly related to you, a judicial probe should be set up in the matter to curb the illegal practice of middlemen and brokers who have created a profitable venture of managing tenders and transfer postings,” Maradi wrote in his tweet to CM Soren.BJP’s Godda parliamentarian Nishikant Dubey too drew the CM’s attention towards the issue in a tweet.Countering the allegations, Alam said, “It’s a conspiracy to defame me. Being a public representative, I owe a responsibility to address the problem of people of my constituency. Some people from Bardharwa came to me and lodged complaint against the contractor. I called him but he didn’t pick up the phone.”“Around 4.30pm, he called me back. I just requested him to withdraw from Bardharwa Haat Bazaar settlement. He offered that he would leave Rajmahal instead of Bardharwa. I told him that Rajmahal is not my constituency and my only concern is with Bardharwa. During the conversation, I neither threatened him nor pressurised him. It was just a request,” he said while speaking to media on Wednesday.The audio disclosed that soon after, the minister handed over the phone to CM’s representative Mishra, who told the contractor that he had no option except to quit from Bardharwa. “If you wouldn’t, you can’t carry your works independently in this region. Trouble will be created,” he said.The contractor then entered into a heated argument with Mishra. Being the CM’s representative, you can’t threat common mass. I will drag you to the court.” The contractor participated in the auction next day on June 22. “They had made arrangements to prevent my entry in Bardharwa. Riding on a motorcycle with my face covered under a helmet, I somehow managed to enter the Nagar Panchayat building. But, they pulled me out and assaulted me even in the presence of police personnel. Following the ruckus, the administration cancelled the auction process,” Shambhu said.He alleged that Mishra, through his henchmen, attacked him. Mishra, however, could not be be reached on phone despite repeated comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/bjp-demands-jharkhand-minister-s-resignation-for-managing-tender/story-MBxe6oPUZ7l0HIIFW8VybN.html

25-06-2020||Patna||Nitish Kumar visits key weir on river near Nepal border||In his first visit outside Patna post-lockdown, chief minister Nitish Kumar, along with water resources minister Sanjay Jha, Wednesday visited Jainagar in Madhubani to take stock of the flood preparedness. He is also likely to visit Valmikinagar in West Champaran and a few other north Bihar districts, which are prone to recurrent floods.After visiting the embankment at Jainagar, Kumar asked the WRD minister to get a proposal made for developing the old Jainagar weir into a modern, automated barrage at the earliest. “It is a historic gift for the Mithilanchal region, as it will also provide water for irrigation to thousands of acres of land,” said Jha.On his way to Madhubani by road, Kumar also visited the upcoming airport at Darbhanga to see the progress. According to sources, Kumar may undertake visits across the state for people’s feedback on development initiatives ahead of the Assembly elections due in the state later this year.The visit to Jainagar is also significant in the wake of the recent posturing by Nepal, which led to delay in carrying out repair work on the other side. He visited the embankment on the Kamla river at Jainagar in Madhubani and Naruar in Jhanjharpur, both places where breaches took place last year, and asked the authorities to speed up work in coordination with the authorities of the neighbouring country.When the CM reached there, work was going on. He saw the water level near the bridge and talked to the officials and engiineers. WRD principal secretary Sanjiv Hans and Madhubani’s district magistrate Dr Nilesh Deore explained to him the current situation with the help of map and sheet-piling work going on.“I have come to this bridge earlier also. Last year, water had overtopped the bridge. This should not happen and adequate arrangements should be made in advance,” the CM said.In a clear departure from the past, when Bihar’s water resource department’s engineers carried out monitoring and repair work on both sides routinely without any hassles, Nepal had stopped work on its side, but later permitted on the condition that the officials must have Coronavirus-free certificate.Kamla river, which originates from Churia range near Maithan in Sindhuli district of Nepal and flows into Bihar, had breached its embankments at seven places last year, causing severe inundation in the Mithilanchal region. For its repair, Kamla Canal division, Jainagar, had signed a memorandum with NNT Developers Pvt Ltd in March this year.However, some parts of two of the breaches on the right marginal embankment of the weir fell on to the no-man’s land on the Indo-Nepal border and the Nepal Armed Police had for the first time stopped work there in April itself. Despite fresh survey by the Madhubani and Nepal administration, it could not be carried out. Later, after the issued was flagged to the Centre, the Nepal authorities gave the go-ahead.After heavy rains in Nepal last year, the water level in Kamla river had suddenly gone up and it was flowing above the Kamla weir at Jainagar. Later, it inundated large parts. Though it is just the beginning of monsoon season, the authorities are alarmed at the prospect of heavy downpour in Nepal than in India, as the roots of Bihar’s devastation due to floods have always been in the Himalayan country. Kumar had on Tuesday directed the officials to keep a watch on vulnerable rivers like Kodi, Gandak, Kamla etc. in the bordering areas by developing proper coordination with the Nepal authorities, with focus on places where breaches were reported in the past. He asked the officials to ensure that communication network worked properly and there were adequate arrangements in the event of flooding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/nitish-kumar-visits-key-weir-on-river-near-nepal-border/story-INSX4olmiAPKFxKk32yGPK.html

He, however, lost to a less-fancied candidate of the JD(U) by a margin of over 50,000 votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/congress-names-tariq-anwar-as-candidate-for-bihar-legislative-council-polls/story-ctRuSGrCoXmhLBOlTgX4HN.html

25-06-2020||Chandigarh||ED attaches ₹24-cr assets of realty firm||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has attached properties worth ₹24 crore belonging to a real estate firm that allegedly duped hundreds of investors of crores of rupees in various parts of Punjab. The firm, Nature Heights Infra Ltd, was being run by Abohar-based Neeraj Thatai alias Neeraj Arora, his wife Doll Thatai and another director of company Amit Kukkar, sources at the ED zonal office in Jalandhar said. Neeraj and Kukkar figure as accused in 31 FIRs filed by the investors in various police stations of the state, and were declared proclaimed offenders in 2017.In June 2019, ED had attached properties worth of ₹22.24 crore of Nature Heights, which was confirmed by the adjudicating authority in New Delhi. MG Gold Realtors Private Ltd, a sister concern of Nature Heights, was also involved in the fraud.The attached immovable assets include ₹10-crore properties belonging to MG Gold in Abohar, Mohali, Rajasthan and other parts of Punjab, the central agency’s officials said. The ED had started probing the case in 2017. During the course of probe, it received 491 more complaints from investors and 497 complaints from various consumer courts of the state. Investigations revealed that Neeraj, in a pre-determined way, tried to launder investors’ money for personal benefits, ED officials said.ED investigations so far have revealed that the firm’s promoters had duped investors to the tune of ₹50 crore on the pretext of allotting properties at different locations in Punjab. So far, firm’s properties worth of ₹46.5 crore have been attached. “Investigations are on to trace the remaining amount of proceeds of crime which may lead to attachment of more properties of Nature Heights Infra Ltd,” ED officials said. An investor said the company had circulated brochures inviting investments in colonies to be developed in Chandigarh, Talwara, Anandpur Sahib, Gobindgarh, Mohali, Zirakpur, Ferozepur and other locations in Punjab. The company allegedly collected crores of rupees from customers before shutting down all branch offices across the state and the promoters vanished in thin air.Investors neither got possession of properties nor their money was returned, officials said. “The firm used to offer cheaper plots at prime locations. Later, it surfaced that most of the colonies awaited approvals from the departments concerned. The company neither allotted plots nor returned the money. Even, the cheques issued by the company were dishonoured,” said another investor.The case was investigated by ED assistant director Deepak Rajpoot and assistant director (PMLA) Rohit Trehan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ed-attaches-24-cr-assets-of-realty-firm/story-I07LZ7uIIJrYpaHwzX3nCO.html

25-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh receives monsoon’s first rainfall in earliest onset since 2013||With 23.8mm rain, the city received monsoon’s first rainfall on Wednesday, six days before its estimated arrival on June 30, and the earliest since 2013. Officially declaring monsoon in northern parts of Punjab and Chandigarh, officials at the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said more rain will follow on Thursday and Friday as it advanced over further parts of Punjab and Haryana.As per IMD data available so far, the earliest-ever onset of monsoon was on June 13 in 2008. The rainy season was last declared before June 24 in 2013 - on June 16, while it was declared just one day later on June 25 in 2011 and 2015. On the early arrival of monsoon, regional IMD director Surender Paul said, “This happened due to two reasons. The cross-equatorial wind flow was strong this year, which helped push the monsoon system northward faster, and the sea surface temperature also created favourable conditions for an early monsoon in the region.”Paul said the early onset of monsoon was likely to bring higher than normal rain this year, and showers in the monsoon months (June, July, August and September) may cross the normal of 845.7mm. Last year, monsoon remained 18% deficient, with 697.4mm rain during this duration. It was delayed by five days so lesser than normal rain was expected.UP TO 60MM RAIN TODAYPaul said moderate rain up to 60mm was likely on Thursday, but will decrease on Friday and will be followed by only cloudy weather on Saturday. He warned of a small possibility of heavy rain (over 60mm) on Thursday if conditions remained favourable. There were two spells of rain on Wednesday, with 22mm rain for an hour around 11.30am and 1.8mm rain around 3pm, as recorded at the IMD observatory in Sector 39.The maximum temperature decreased from 35.8 degrees Celsius on Tuesday to 33.3 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, four degrees below normal. The minimum temperature, however, went up from 28.8 degrees Celsius on Tuesday to 29.4 degrees Celsius on Wednesday, five notches above normal. In the next three days, the maximum and minimum temperatures are expected to remain around 33 degrees and 28 degrees respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-receives-monsoon-s-first-rainfall-in-earliest-onset-since-2013/story-l2qazoj9sd4T9KfyBe4cvN.html

A local police team that rushed to the spot found that a team led by Vijay Kumar, Kaithal CIA wing in-charge, conducted a raid to nab a proclaimed offender (PO) and his associate. The cops from the neighbouring state did not inform the local police about this.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP investigation) Gurmeet Singh said the Haryana cops arrested Ajay Kumar, a resident of Kaithal, and Karamjeet Singh of Jalandhar. He said Ajay was wanted by the Kaithal police in a case of jumping of parole while Karamjit was nabbed for sheltering him.“They fired one round to puncture the tyre of the car in which Ajay and Karamjeet were sitting to prevent them from fleeing. We are looking into the matter to take legal action against the team of cops as Jalandhar they did not keep the local police in loop,” the DCP added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-cops-open-fire-in-jalandhar-arrest-2-without-informing-local-police/story-vTSwbMdBLiLvNtg1Ayj8aM.html

The move has resulted in much resentment among the farmers.Various farmer clubs expressed anguish over the move and said farmers are paying the price for the political tug- of-war over the alleged seed scam.Amrinder Singh Poonia, president of the kisan club, who was leading the delegation of farmers, said, “PAU had given varieties of seeds to farmers that are highly productive for short durations to farmers. This will help the farmers in many ways. One, farmers will pump less underground water and secondly, they will be able to harvest it early so there is enough time to manage stubble. Instead of helping the farmers with more field trials, curbs are being imposed due to political pressure.”PAU vice-chancellor Dr Baldev Singh Dhillon said it was decided during a meeting held recently with food and civil supply minister that seeds of new varieties will be produced only by PAU and ICAR in the first year of its release and private dealers will be allowed thereafter. He said that as field trials fall under the purview of the university, they have decided to take measures to check the misuse of the grain harvested from these trials.These include reduction in plot size of field trials on rice from one canal to four marlas and aadhaar card details of farmers chosen for field trials will be collected by PAU and the state agriculture department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/paddy-seed-scam-pau-imposes-stringent-rules-on-field-trials-kisan-club-members-left-fuming/story-0ISR6HdsgWJeSeshCYW9WL.html

The FIR was registered on May 26 under the provisions of the Mines and Minerals (Development & Regulation) Act, 1975, at Rahon police station in SBS Nagar.The court impleaded the director as a party in the case and also asked him and SBS Nagar senior superintendent of police to file their affidavits to indicate the details, including the ownership of the vehicles impounded in the FIR in question. The petitioners have been given interim protection from arrest and asked to join investigation.The court has taken serious note of the observation of a trial court in the matter that ‘it was very surprising that illegal mining at such a large-scale was going on in the area and entire state machinery was turning a blind eye’. “Rather it shows the active connivance of all those who were supposed to check it,” the trial court had observed in its order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/illegal-mining-hc-summons-sbs-nagar-dsp-puts-mining-director-on-notice/story-0ckZkBAiuLIKjmsa4PVLJL.html

Seating arrangement has been changed to maintain social distancing; thermal screening of visitors is being done and hand sanitisers have been kept at every table.”President of hotel and restaurant association Amarvir Singh said, “Many restaurants have opened and others are making arrangements as shortage of labour is also an issue. Even though outlets had begun home delivery, they are relieved that their establishments have been opened for dine-in after three months of lockdown.”The restaurants were shut down after the imposition of curfew in the state on March 23. The government had allowed restaurants to open on May 8, but only for home delivery of food and takeaways till 8pm.‘TIMINGS UNSUITABLE FOR INDUSTRY’Owner of Penthouse on Ferozepur road, Sachin Goyal, said, “The bars have not been allowed to open and the dine-in facility has been allowed only till 8pm. Most customers like to go out only after 8pm. Opening the restaurant at this stage would end up increasing our fixed expenses.”Owner of Bruu Kiln on Malhar road, Karanjit Singh, said, “Very few people come out for lunch in Ludhiana and kitty parties are not taking place at all. As per the trends witnessed in Ludhiana, people do not come out for dinner by 8pm. We are looking into the possibilities and might open the restaurant for dine-in in the coming days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/allowed-to-provide-dine-in-facility-till-8pm-restaurants-in-ludhiana-reopen-to-tepid-response/story-dWMYyu1o6LYPtE3z7aAJ1K.html

On this, the firm moved the court that ordered a stay for three months on March 12.After its elapse on June 12, MC issued a 24-hour notice on June 18, and took over the plant on June 19. On Saturday, the firm had approached the court again for restoring the possession and ensuring status quo ante (previously existing state of affairs).Deepali Puri, advocate appearing on behalf of the MC, said, “The three-month stay sought by Jaypee group was extended by one month, however, it was communicated to us on Saturday when the plant was already taken over by the MC. We have challenged their stay in HC and have asked time to file a reply in Chandigarh court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/dadumajra-garbage-plant-possession-no-relief-for-jaypee-group-matter-adjourned-till-june-30/story-ZEKZ79AQYRPDBxp5emtqOI.html

25-06-2020||Chandigarh||Patiala college files complaint against portal for stealing data||A complaint has been lodged with the cyber crime cell of Punjab Police against a web portal that claims to be facilitating college and university admissions. In his complaint, Patiala-based MM College’s principal has accused the portal managers of siphoning off data of public universities and their affiliated aided colleges and then coaxing aspirants to take admissions in private universities based in Chandigarh and Jalandhar.Following numerous complaints from its colleges and school of management studies, the Punjabi University management too has decided to take legal action against the website — collegedunia.com — for the alleged wrong practice.“It is a major issue at a time when the admission process is on in government universities and their colleges. The web portal is working on the behalf of some private universities and luring aspirants on the pretext of easy admissions and placements, especially in management courses,” said Punjabi University vice-chancellor Prof BS Ghuman.It is learnt that after a student registers and enquires about admission in a government university or an affiliated and aided college in Punjab on the portal, he or she receives phone calls from the website representatives, who offer easy admission in private universities instead. The portal representatives even claim that they are authorised by the state universities and colleges to talk on their behalf.Ghuman said they have discussed the issue in detail and have decided to register a formal police complaint.“The process has been initiated for legal action against the portal as it will affect admissions in Punjabi University and its colleges,” he said. Ghuman said the varsity has not authorised any private website to admit students on its behalf.“Not only our college but other government-aided colleges are facing the same problem,” said Modi College principal Khushvinder Kumar, who is the president of the association of principals of aided colleges.“The website collegedunia.com is registering students on behalf of colleges using their logos and other information on their website. For instance, after registering for a course in MM College, the aspirant gets a registration confirmation message from a private university instead,” Kumar said.He said the website violates the intellectual property rights and was causing revenue loss to colleges by misleading the aspirants.Though there was no response to repeated calls and emails sent to the website, Twitter handle — @college_dunia — of the portal said: “There might be a confusion around the business model and plus we haven’t received any complaint so far. So, we can only comment if we see the content of the complaint. Collegedunia uses data that is available in the public domain and shares insights for the aspirants looking out for such colleges. We generally compare the colleges on the basis of cost and placements.”Cyber cell deputy superintendent of police Chiranjiv Lamba said they have received a complaint. “The matter is already brought into the notice of senior officials. A sub-inspector rank officer has been directed to investigate. Further action will be taken as per the law,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/patiala-college-files-complaint-against-portal-for-stealing-data/story-I8Xpebvg59jt5F4gIFlLRJ.html
25-06-2020||City||Bhiwandi’s new civic chief proposes 5-point plan to tackle Covid-19||Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation’s new commissioner, Pankaj Ashiya has developed a five-point plan of action to reduce the number of Covid-19 cases in the city. The plan includes setting up mohalla clinics, involving community leaders in awareness drives, improving medical facilities, increasing contact tracing, and surveying all containment zones.“After studying the scenario in Bhiwandi, awareness and better health infrastructure seem to be the needs of the hour. We have conducted meetings with maulanas, and they will volunteer to spread awareness on safety measures and social distancing norms. Moreover, we have contacted six schools across Bhiwandi which will be converted into quarantine centres. All the ward officers and health department officials are aware of the five-point agenda that will help reduce the spread or break the chain of the virus,” said Ashiya, who began his new position on Monday. Ashiya was earlier the special monitoring officer for Covid-19 in Malegaon and played a key role in controlling the number of cases there. He was also posted in Thane for 10 days to assist the former commissioner Praveen Ashtikar to bring down the number of cases in five hotspots. Bhiwandi currently has more than 1,332 positive cases and 88 deaths.As part of the new Covid battle plan, the civic body will also increase the mohalla clinics in the city from the current 15. Locals suffering from fever, cold, cough, and malaria can seek treatment at these clinics.“One of the main reasons for the rise in mortality rate is because patients do not reach hospitals in time. Despite having symptoms, tests are not conducted. With the help of community leaders, the message to reach out to the mohalla clinics will be passed on. This will help patients get timely treatment,” said Ashiya.To improve medical facilities, the bed capacity in private hospitals along with a rate card will be displayed for the benefit of locals. Contact tracing will be carried out more extensively, and a survey of containment zones will be conducted.Officials from the municipal corporation also advised people to not touch the dead bodies of Covid-positive victims. “Their bodies are wrapped in plastic and handed over so the final rites can be conducted as per each one’s faith. However, only a few should be present at the funeral,” said an official from the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhiwandi-s-new-civic-chief-proposes-5-point-plan-to-tackle-covid-19/story-kyhaJlGLk5Ts2BK2Y6oc6L.html
25-06-2020||Mumbai||5 tiger deaths in 10 days in state, NTCA enquiry reveals lapses||Over the last 10 days, five tigers have died in Maharashtra, including four deaths under unusual circumstances. An inquiry into the deaths by the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) revealed lapses by the forest department.“The number of wild tiger deaths within a matter of days is worrying. We have directed our regional officer to investigate and submit a report at the earliest,” said Anup Nayak, member secretary, NTCA.A parallel internal investigation by the state forest department confirmed carelessness one case. “We have taken action against our staff for negligence in Tadoba buffer. An enquiry is underway in another case in Nagpur,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife).On Tuesday, an adult male tiger was found dead in Chatgaon range of Gadchiroli. “The animal was eight years old, and died in an infighting incident with another tiger,” said SR Kumaraswamy, deputy conservator of forest (Gadchiroli).Hemant Kamdi, assistant inspector general of forests, NTCA and investigating officer for the five deaths said there were no lapses in the Gadchiroli case.Between June 10 and 14, the putrefied carcasses of three tigers - tigress and her two cubs - were found at the Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve (TATR) buffer in Chandrapur. Three arrested locals had confessed to poisoning the tigers.“There was a delay by the forest department in identifying the carcasses, and lack of seriousness in the entire investigation,” said Kamdi. “The protection regime needs to be enhanced. The tigress’ death was reported next to a road. It was detected late. The carcasses of her cubs, which were lying 200m away, were only detected after three days,” he said.So far nine tiger deaths have been reported in Maharashtra since January, of which six are from the Tadoba landscape.Kakodkar said, “One forest guard at TATR buffer has been suspended, and the range forest officer has been issued a show-cause notice. Follow up investigation is underway.”On June 22, 12 days after being captured for killing five people in Chandrapur, an adult male tiger (KT1) died at Nagpur’s Gorewada rescue centre. The post-mortem of the aberrant tiger revealed possible death due to septicaemia (a bloodstream infection).Kamdi said, based on his investigation, the exact cause of death was unclear. “The tiger had a 16cm wide and 9cm long abscess (with pus) on his left thigh. It may or may not have died due to septicaemia. Though lab reports will confirm this, the tiger was being treated with medicines used in septicaemia cases. The animal had no corroborative symptoms of septicaemia,” he said. Officials from the rescue centre said they had not assessed the tiger’s health based on blood reports post-capture. “We failed to collect blood samples as the tiger was extremely aggressive, and tranquilising him could have been life-threatening,” said Nandkishor Kale, divisional manager, Gorewada.Kamdi said this was noted in the enquiry report. “Identifying the tiger’s condition based on a blood test post-capture could have determined details about when the infection happened,” he said.“Further action in the Gorewada matter would be undertaken once final lab reports are received,” said Kakodkar.Meanwhile, the petitioner in the 2019 Avni tigress matter before the Bombay high court (HC), Sarita Subramaniam wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Wednesday calling for a judicial enquiry into the tiger deaths.”Healthy tigers are dying under the forest department’s watch. This is deliberate murder by officers, untrained vets, and the inept team at the rescue centre. We have called for the immediate transfer of such officers,” she said.Wildlife experts were concerned about rising tiger deaths. “Losing five tigers in 10 days is a big issue. From the tiger conservation point of view, the loss of the tigress and her cubs, and poisoning incident so close to a tiger reserve is extremely disappointing,” said Nitin Desai, director (central India), Wildlife Protection Society of India.Tigress death at Aurangabad zoo, swab samples sent for Covid-19 testA six-year-old tigress ‘Kareena’ died at the Siddharth Garden and Zoo, Aurangabad, early Wednesday morning. According to the Aurangabad Municipal Corporation (AMC), after the tigress was not eating properly since Sunday, zoo officials collected blood samples and test results showed she was suffering from a kidney ailment. “The animal was declared dead at 5.20 am, and her autopsy report stated that she died due to kidney disease. While her tissue samples have been sent for further analysis to a lab in Pune, we collected samples of her nasal and throat discharge using a cotton swab and sent it for Covid-19 test just as a precautionary measure as per the Central Zoo Authority protocol,” said a senior AMC official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/5-tigers-deaths-in-10-days-in-state-ntca-enquiry-reveals-lapses/story-ZoOO78951nuO1zeKrKwWsI.html

He also assured that the Covid situation in the city would improve in the next few days. Sharma, who replaced Vijay Singhal, said the focus will be on identifying and bridging gaps and strengthening the system. He conducted a review meeting with civic officials on Wednesday morning.Sharma was appointed as Thane civic commissioner late on Tuesday night, replacing Singhal, who was appointed merely three months ago in March.Responding to the recent incidents of deaths due to unavailability of beds, Sharma said, “Instead of providing hospital beds to Covid patients who do not have any symptoms, the beds should be made available to those who require them. Our focus will be to create basic infrastructure, so that no critical Covid patient remains without a bed.”A 2005 batch Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer, Sharma had previously served as additional civic commissioner in Pune and collector of Latur.In his new role, his major challenges will be to flatten the Covid curve and deal with monsoon-related diseases and calamities in Thane. “We will work in areas where the strengthening of safety measures is needed. The focus will be on identifying the gaps and filling them. We will also carry forward the good work initiated by the previous commissioner. At present, I do not have a plan of action, and it will take at least two to three days to formulate one. The emphasis will also be on ensuring that people abide by social distancing norms, wear masks and adopt basic sanitization,” he said.BJP demands Jaiswal’s returnBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator Narayan Pawar had demanded that instead of experimenting, the state should appoint ex-commissioner of Thane, Sanjeev Jaiswal, during this time of the pandemic. “He had successfully undertaken many projects in his five-year tenure and knows the city well.

25-06-2020||Mumbai||No wetlands in Uran under our jurisdiction, only agricultural lands: NMSEZ tells state||The Navi Mumbai Special Economic Zone (NMSEZ) has informed the state that there are no wetlands in the areas under its jurisdiction even though the state forest department had identified areas near the Thane creek flamingo sanctuary (TCFS) as satellite wetlands. NMSEZ is an integrated industrial township across 4,000 acres proposed in Uran, 26% of which is owned by state body City Industrial Development Corporation Ltd. (Cidco) and 74% by private investors. In 2019, following allegations of debris dumping and mangrove destruction in Panje and other areas in Uran, the Maharashtra Coastal Zone Management Authority (MCZMA) directed the collector of Raigad to investigate the matter.In a letter dated May 13, accessed by HT and addressed to multiple departments of Raigad district administration, NMSEZ wrote, “We have seen that Panje is being loosely referred at several instances as ‘Panje wetland’ but in reality, there is no wetland in Panje nor any of the NMSEZ land leased by Cidco because it is agricultural land acquired by the Maharashtra government and handed over to Cidco for development of industrial and residential areas.”Pramod Patil, nodal officer (environment), Cidco confirmed this. “There are no wetlands in Uran in lands owned by Cidco. Submissions by NMSEZ are correct. The response was filed with the help of Cidco,” he said.NMSEZ also claimed there has been only one case of mangrove destruction in the last 10 years in its areas and only a 30-40 metre stretch is in a coastal regulation zone (where no construction is permitted). NMSEZ has pointed out that the state’s list of wetlands from January 2020 does not include Panje, Bhendkhal or Belpada. The state forest department’s TCFS management plan 2020-30 identifies these three areas in Uran as satellite wetlands in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). However, they are yet to be notified as such by the state environment department.Environmentalists contested NMSEZ and Cidco’s claims. “Panje has been identified as a wetland in the National Wetland Atlas and there are Supreme Court orders that direct the protection of those wetlands identified under the atlas,” said Debi Goenka, executive trustee, Conservation Action Trust.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-wetlands-in-uran-under-our-jurisdiction-only-agricultural-lands-nmsez-tells-state/story-bfNuAPevmcmtJ13eiVnk9J.html

He has pleaded that the accused booked for murder does not fall under the category of the prisoners who cannot be released from jail, as recommended by the high power committee of Bombay high court.The CBI in its objection on Friday said that though the minutes of high power committee has not included murder charges, in the list of charges for which the bail cannot be granted, the court has to decide the plea on the merits. The CBI claimed that the prosecution has submitted enough evidence against Khanna to prove his role in the alleged murder of Sheena and subsequent act of destruction of her body and other evidence.After considering arguments from both the side, the court refused to grant any relief to Khanna. The detailed order would be made available to lawyers later.Meanwhile, Indrani approached the special CBI court for bail for the sixth time. While her previous bail plea is still pending for arguments by CBI, the fresh plea is filed on the ground of spread of Covid-19 in jail. She has alleged that she is vulnerable to contracting the virus. The special court has now asked the CBI to respond to the plea by Friday and scheduled arguments on the plea by July 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sheena-murder-sanjeev-khanna-s-bail-plea-rejected-indrani-seeks-relief/story-W3RpahuhqDFY0IjSxoV61I.html
25-06-2020||Mumbai||SBI employee accused of misappropriating ₹36 crore, gets interim protection from arrest||The Bombay high court on Tuesday granted temporary protection from arrest to a branch manager of the State Bank of India (SBI) who is accused of misappropriating ₹36 crore out of the fixed deposits of the Bombay Iron and Steel Labour Board.Byculla police booked Nikhil Roy, manager of the Mazagaon Circle branch of SBI, for criminal breach of trust and cheating on the basis of a complaint lodged by the Board on June 8, 2019.The board alleged that it had deposited ₹45 crore in fixed deposits, and the bank had in April 2019 issued a letter certifying the deposits, but the branch manager misappropriated amount of ₹36 crore, which was purportedly shown as premature withdrawal. Apprehending arrest in the case, Roy moved high court claiming that he had prematurely released amount of ₹36 crore - contained in four fixed deposit receipts on the request of the complainant board. He claimed that he processed the request, as it was supported by four separate resolutions of the board and had transferred the amount to four different entities, again as requested by the board.Public prosecutor Deepak Thakare opposed Roy’s plea. He submitted that no such resolution was passed by the board and none of the fixed deposit receipts were validly discharged. He pointed out that all the original receipts were still lying with the board, and investigation to ascertain genuineness of the resolutions and receipts is on.Justice SK Shinde, however, noticed that the confirmation letter of April 11, 2019 did not bear the outward number. When confronted with this, Thakare sought time to verify genuineness of the confirmation letter.On his request, justice Shinde placed Roy’s anticipatory bail plea for further hearing on July 10, with a direction to the public prosecutor to submit on interim report disclosing material particulars of the recipients of the amount alleged to be misappropriated.The court has also directed the police to release Roy on cash bail of ₹50,000 if he was arrested in the meantime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/sbi-employee-accused-of-misappropriating-36-crore-gets-interim-protection-from-arrest/story-8EqlVTnJVwCUrrq4Kr4V7K.html

The plasma of Gurvinder Pal Singh, a resident of the Chheharta area in the city, was successfully used on two Covid-19 patients at the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Amritsar. He was tested positive for Covid-19 on May 20 and underwent treatment at the isolation ward of GMCH for 15 days. “We are extremely thankful to Gurvinder for donating his plasma, as it can prove helpful in treating critically ill patients. The blood group of Gurvinder is ‘A’ negative and his plasma could be used for treating patients of the same blood group. None of the critically ill patients admitted in GMCH, however, has the matching blood group,” said GMC Amritsar principal Dr Sujata Sharma. “We sent his plasma to Ludhiana and took plasma of ‘B’ positive blood group in return. Using the ‘B’ positive blood group, the plasma therapy has been successfully given to two Covid-19 positive patients who are admitted here. One of the patients is a resident of the city while the other belongs to Pathankot,” Dr Sujata said. Under the treatment called convalescent plasma therapy, antibody-rich blood plasma of patients, who have recovered from Covid-19, is preserved for transfusion into critical patients. The GMC Amritsar got approval from the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to treat Covid-19 patients with the therapy on June 19. So far, the Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot, had conducted the state’s only and successful convalescent plasma transplant. PLASMA BANK SET UP  IN GMCH AMRITSAR“Plasma bank has been set up in GMCH’s blood bank where plasma of Covid-19 recovered patients will be collected and stored. GMC Amritsar is now part of the Punjab’s plasma pool system through which we will now exchange plasma of Amritsar’s people with medical colleges of Patiala and Faridkot, so that plasma of each blood group can be available to treat patients,” Dr Sujata added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-27-year-old-dubai-returnee-becomes-amritsar-s-first-plasma-donor/story-z1i6GtI4Ftb1dAXpe8thtL.html

He has done injustice to several Bahujan groups. That’s why Sharad Pawar is the coronavirus that has infected Maharashtra.”NCP leaders slammed Padalkar’s remarks with youth NCP leaders threatening to blacken his face, while Pune party leaders planninga protest. “Sometimes leaders like Padalkar lose their mental balance and make remarks like these. What is his standing against a leader of the stature of Pawar? This leader slammed Modi and then joined his party to get a ticket,” said NCP leader and state housing minister Jitendra Awhad. BJP legislator Atul Bhatkalkar said the BJP did not support Padalkar’s remarks which were “unfortunate”. Leader of Opposition in the legislative Council Pravin Darekar said his party did not endorse such remarks. Former chief minister and senior BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis also reprimanded Padalkar for the comment.“Sharad Pawar is not our enemy but a political opponent. I have discussed the issue with Padalkar and in no circumstances, his remarks can be justified. Padalkar has also accepted to take corrective steps,” said Fadnavis.Padalkar was recently nominated to the legislative Council by the BJP.

25-06-2020||Chandigarh||Stray dog sterilisation project: Failing to allot project to private firm, MC mulls using services of own vet||After failing to allot the stray dog sterilisation project to private players, the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) is considering to use the services of one its two veterinary doctors for the task.In the last 10-months, the MC has not undertaken dog sterilisation work in the city.The city has been witnessing a rapid increase in the stray dog population and the number of dog bite cases has also gone up by 35% in the last five years, as per the MC.According to the latest animal census, conducted by the UT animal husbandry and fisheries department, the number of stray dogs reached 12,900 in 2019, up from 7,847 in the last census conducted in 2012.MC FLOATED 3 TENDERS SINCE AUGUST LAST YEARSince August last year, the MC has floated three tenders, inviting private companies to undertake the project. In the tender floated in August, the MC got no response. In the subsequent tenders, floated in December 2019 and February this year, the MC received one bid each but due to the single-bid tender norms, the MC was unable to allot the project to the firm that came forward.It is now planning to utilise the services of one the two veterinary doctors, hired on contract basis for the animal slaughterhouse.“The service of one veterinary doctor can be utilised for sterilising dogs in addition to his current duty. One veterinary pharmacist will assist him. Initially, the current staff will be used. There will be requirement of surgical packs and other equipment, which the MC intends to purchase,” said an MC official.The MC officials will be discussing the issue of stray dog sterilisation in the finance and contract committee (F&CC) meeting scheduled for Thursday. F&CC will also decide on deputing contractual veterinary doctor on additional duty for dog sterilisation.Sector 48 resident welfare association (RWA) president JJ Singh said, “The municipal corporation’s programme to neuter stray dogs is failing as their population continues to rise. Many people feed the stray dogs, which then sit in the neighbourhood parks of the Sector. Many residents feel scared while walking here especially in the evening.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/stray-dog-sterilisation-project-failing-to-allot-project-to-private-firm-mc-mulls-using-services-of-own-vet/story-0TqdLEdXjgSB3rLttB9H4J.html
25-06-2020||Mumbai||Recoveries rise at a faster pace, active cases go up slowly: BMC||While the number of recoveries in the city rose by 9,424 over the past 11 days, the active cases have risen by only 1,381, according to data collated by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC).BMC data shows that 25,152 patients recovered from Covid-19 on June 12, which increased to 34,576 on June 23. On June 13, the city had 28,682 active Covid-19 patients, which went up to 30,063 on June 23. The number of new daily cases has not crossed 1,560 between June 13 and 23. Health experts from the civic body attributed the rise in recovery rate to higher testing – 4,500 tests every day. “Although it is still early to say, we are witnessing a gradual fall in the number of Covid-19 cases. As more patients are getting discharged, the recovery rate has gone higher,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC. Patients infected with the Sars-Cov-2 virus that causes Covid-19 take up to two to four weeks to recover from the infection. Health officials said as days pass, the curve of active cases will typically stay behind the curve of recovered patients. “In May, we had quarantined a large number of people from containment zones. Now, after 14 days of isolation, we are releasing them after they test negative,” said Shah.When the lockdown was relaxed on June 8, civic officials speculated that easing of restrictions was likely to add to the already rising number of cases. “With rising awareness, citizens are following safety rules such as physical distancing and wearing masks. This pattern is visible all across the country. Although we took time to surpass the rate of active patients due to the huge population, we have finally achieved it,” said Suresh Kakani, additional commissioner, BMC.Most countries with the highest caseload have more recovered cases than active cases, with the United States an exception. Among the 50 countries with the highest case count, India ranks 29 in terms of recovery rate, according to Johns Hopkins University. The recovery rate in Germany is 91%, Turkey 84%, Israel 83%, Iran 78%, Italy 71%, Spain 62% and Russia 49%.Doctors said the number of recoveries is expected to continue to rise compared to active infections in the coming days, unless there is a sudden explosion of new cases during the monsoon.“We have to be more cautious with the arrival of the monsoon. We don’t know how this virus will react to the season,” said Dr Om Srivastava, an epidemiologist who is part of the state Covid-19 task force. “The next one week will be important to understand the pattern.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/recoveries-rise-at-a-faster-pace-active-cases-go-up-slowly-bmc/story-z9Gi0MHEWBS4oq0CGeWG9K.html

One of its front flippers was injured. The fishermen presume that the propeller of a passing trawler in deep sea, may have caused the injury.Aniket Shirke, chief of the mangrove cell in Palghar, along with other officials reached the spot and took custody of the turtle. The turtle is currently at the Turtle Rescue Centre, run by the Wildlife Conservation and Animal Welfare Association (WCAWA), Dahanu.Olive Ridley turtles are found along Kelwe, Mahim, Tembhi, Shirgaon coasts in Palghar and majority of them are either injured by the passing trawlers in the deep sea or get entangled in fishing nets, said Shrike. “We cut the net using sharp knives and rescued the turtle. The rescue by the two fishermen is commendable,” said Prathamesh Prabhutendolkar, an animal activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/palghar-fishermen-rescue-olive-ridley-turtle/story-BUcZi5mTRQANC1rAk9HXuI.html

Over 1,000 patients have so far availed of the free service.Located at the SIO-JIH Office in Ghass Bazar, the free clinic operates daily, between 9am and 11am, with Dr. Mohammad Furqan Muzumdar in attendance. Dr Muzumdar is a director at VCARE Diagnostic and Medical Centre. Ghass Bazar, Ansari Chowk, Dooth Naka, Rohidas Wada and Govindwadi in Kalyan (West) were declared a containment zone on June 13. “When curbs were imposed, some organisations decided to come up with facilities to help residents in these areas. This is how we decided to open the free OPD. We are also providing diagnostic services with around 50% concessions,” said Dr. Muzumdar. “There are several doctors who have shut their clinics because either they got infected [by Covid-19] or are not willing to take risks. Many patients are clueless about what to do if they are sick. If any patient has Covid symptoms, they are compulsorily asked to visit the civic hospital,” he added.Under the Epidemic Diseases Act, doctors are supposed to keep their clinics open. Dr Prashant Patil, spokesperson for Kalyan Doctors’ Army, said “The civic body has already asked all general doctors to open their clinics and not deny patients. If there is any such doctor found not opening their clinic, residents can approach the Kalyan Doctors’ Army or the civic body. We will consult with the doctors and ask for justification.”For citizens who may have queries regarding tests and medical consultation, a helpline (8883968396) has been set up by VCARE Diagnostic and Medical Centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/1-000-poor-patients-treated-more-to-go-at-this-free-opd/story-AIXVkIY4mEu4H2cW33QS4M.html

Advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni submitted that the state had consistently maintained that it was principally against conducting exams during the coronavirus outbreak.A division bench of justice Dipankar Datta and justice SS Shinde, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by Arvind Tiwari, a parent and advocate seeking cancellation of Class 10 and Class 12 board exams of the CISCE, was informed by the state that it had decided not to permit the exams to be held.Kumbhakoni submitted a note by Vandana Krishna, additional chief secretary, school education and sports department, stating that a meeting of the state disaster management committee had been held through video conferencing on June 22 under the chairmanship of chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray.“It was decided that the state cannot permit the conduct of the ICSE exams [Class 10] from July 2, 2020, given the current Covid-19 situation in the state. This decision may be conveyed to the Hon’ble Bombay high court,” the note read.When petitioners in support of conducting the exams in July informed the court that some states could allow the rescheduled exams to be held, the court asked Kumbhakoni for the state’s stand in such a scenario. The AG submitted said that the council was free to take the students to neighbouring states and allow them to appear for the exams there. When asked if the state’s decision was applicable for the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) exams as well, Kumbhakoni, who was assisted by government pleader Poornima Kantharia, submitted that the government had not addressed the issue as this petition was pertaining solely to CISCE exams. He added that the issue would be addressed as and when CBSE approached it.As CISCE is yet to submit its methodology of grading students who do not opt for the physical exams, the bench posted the hearing for June 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maha-won-t-allow-cisce-exams-for-class-10-12-to-be-held-in-july-2-state-to-hc/story-QIB6vwNh2Kjf08xeklUarI.html

25-06-2020||Mumbai||FYJC admissions: No ‘first come, first served’ this year||In the wake of the Covid-19 outbreak, the state education department has simplified the admission process for first-year junior colleges (FYJC) in Maharashtra for the academic year 2020-21. The department said results of Class 10 will be out by July-end and the admission process for FYJC will begin in August.Every year, over two lakh students apply to colleges in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) that have over three lakh seats. According to the new guidelines that were issued late on Tuesday, there will be no ‘first come, first served’ (FCFS) rounds for admissions this year. Instead, special rounds will be conducted for students who do not get admission in regular rounds.FCFS rounds usually follow regular admission rounds wherein students can claim seats against vacancies across colleges in a particular city or district and are allotted seats on the basis of who claims them first. These rounds were introduced in 2018-19, but were criticised by many parents and experts as they allowed students with lower scores to get into coveted colleges against vacant seats. Similarly, a zero round for students who wish to take admissions for bifocal courses has been scrapped and these admissions will now take place through regular rounds. “The decision has been taken on the basis of complaints from parents about FCFS rounds. Some other changes have been made considering the current situation, to make the process easy for students,” said an official from the state education department.Admissions under various quotas such as minority, management and in-house will be granted as per the usual process. The department will make a provision for uploading documents on the online portal. Similarly, admission booklets will also be given online and students can also pay fees on the portal.This year, the government has decided to increase the quota for students with special needs to 4% from 3%, while the quota for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes (SEBC) has been reduced to 12% from 16% in accordance with the state rules.A total of 50% seats in junior colleges affiliated to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation will be reserved for students of civic schools. After regular admission rounds are conducted, a special admission round will be conducted, followed by additional special rounds, in case, students are left without a seat.Students who fail to take admission in the college mentioned as their first preference can only apply in the special round with new preferences. Those who wish to opt out of the admission process (in case of migration or admission to diploma courses) can do so on the online portal. What is new this year?- No ‘first come, first served’ rounds to be held this year- Only regular and special rounds to be conducted for admissions based on merit - No zero round for bifocal admissions before the regular rounds.

25-06-2020||Chandigarh||Following Chandigarh education dept order against school fee hike, parents demand money back||Parents of private school students across the city are demanding adjustment of 8% hiked fee amount for three months, which they had already paid before the education department barred schools from increasing the fee.The department had, on June 3, ordered that no private school in Chandigarh can increase the fee for the current academic year, in view of the economic slowdown due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown. The order also directed that schools can charge only tuition fee, at the same rates as in 2019-2020.Prior to this, the education department had, in March, directed all schools to reschedule the last date for depositing fee for the year 2020-21. However, on May 20, the UT administration changed its stand and allowed schools to charge only ‘tuition fees’ after which the schools charged fees at hiked rates for the month of March, April and May.In June, fresh orders barring schools from hiking the fee were released but by then, most parents had already paid the increased amount.Independent schools association president HS Mamik said, “The education department has created a lot of confusion. In most schools, 80 to 85 % of the parents have already paid the fees at the increased rates. The hike had been decided in December and we had also informed the department about the same.”“The matter is sub-judice in Punjab and Haryana high court. We will only adjust the fees if the high-court orders us to do so,” he added.Nitin Goyal, president of the Chandigarh parents association, said, “Multiple complaints have been filed with the education department regarding this issue, however, there is no clarity by the department on the same. Moreover, the department is also silent on charging of late fees fine by schools, which in turn forces parents to pay hiked fees.”Rubinderjit Singh Brar, director school education, said he will examine the issue and said, “We will ask schools to adjust the future dues again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/following-chandigarh-education-dept-order-against-school-fee-hike-parents-demand-money-back/story-wlYXjEeNEcTOLstHYgUbfL.html
25-06-2020||Mumbai||Exams for medical, dental courses deferred: MUHS||A week after the Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) announced that exams for all medical and dental courses will take place between July and August, they released another circular late on Tuesday stating that exams remain postponed till further notice. Authorities at MUHS said the decision was taken in view of the status of Covid-19 cases in the state.“The decision on exams remains suspended until we hear from the state authorities about the status of Covid-19. Students and colleges will be informed about the same,” stated the circular. Earlier this month, medical and dental students had requested MUHS that exams be cancelled, especially since many students are already involved in Covid-19 related duties in several hospitals across the state. After authorities refused to accept their request, students sought an extension of the ₹5-lakh Covid-19 insurance to appear for exams. MUHS had agreed to take up this matter with state government but has not responded on this as yet.Last week, the university announced that exams would be held and students would have the option of choosing an exam centre closer to their homes since many students are not back at their institutes. While students and parents are happy with news of the postponement, many have demanded that examinations be cancelled. “These students are risking their own lives and that of their family members by working on Covid-19 relief work. The state should not insist on exams now. Since all other university exams have been called off, professional courses can also follow the same, keeping in mind the health and safety of students,” said Anant Sharma, parent of a MBBS student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/exams-for-medical-dental-courses-deferred-muhs/story-v7KIYBB1kmbwvYriGNrvQO.html
25-06-2020||Mumbai||Pay ₹28.38L for using Byculla building as quarantine facility: HC to BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) will have to pay ₹28.38 lakh per month for using a newly constructed building at Byculla to use as a quarantine facility to keep about 950 high-risk Covid-19 contacts from E ward.The Bombay high court on Friday allowed the civic body to continue to use the building constructed by Neelkamal Realtors Tower, but subjected it to the condition that the civic body pay transit rent to 218 residentiary and commercial tenants who are to be accommodated in the building.The bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice NR Borkar said BMC will have to pay transit rent to the tenants from April 24, 2020, the date on which it took over the building. It further ordered it to clear the arrears in 15 days and start paying regular monthly rent from June 24.The court allowed use of the private building for quarantine purposes in view of the fact that majority of the tenants had not objected to or challenged the requisition of the building. Only nine tenants, who had filed an intervention application through advocate Vivek Shukla for payment of their transit rent, had raised objection.The order was passed on a petition filed by Neelkamal Realtors Tower challenging validity of a clause of the Maharashtra Covid-19 Regulations, 2020 that empowered the revenue and civic authorities to requisition private buildings. The developer also questioned BMC’s decision to take over a building constructed by them as part of the rehabilitation project at Byculla.BMC had responded to the petition contending that increasing number of Covid-19 patients as well as high-risk contacts in E ward, coupled with lack of appropriate constructed space for quarantine purposes, compelled the civic body to requisition the building.According to senior advocate Anil Sakhare, representing the civic body, about 975 persons tested positive for Covid-19 in E Ward and 2,699 are at high risk and they required to be quarantined. BMC has converted 234 flats in the building into a quarantine facility with a capacity of 1,000 beds, of which about 950 were occupied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pay-28-38l-for-using-byculla-building-as-quarantine-facility-hc-to-bmc/story-nZRLOmpuUNH1vhMz7ViLNO.html

25-06-2020||Mumbai||Future tense for co-operative banks?||As the Union cabinet approved ordinance to bring co-operative banks under the purview of Reserve Bank of India (RBI), concerns have been raised over the future of the co-operative banking sector that plays an important role in state’s agriculture and rural economy. Experts believe that some provisions in the ordinance will put the existence of the sector in danger as they will ultimately lead to its conversion in to commercial banking system and defeat its core principles and objectives.Vidyadhar Anaskar, chairman, Maharashtra State Cooperative (MSC) Bank, said some provisions are welcomed as they will help in removing scope of financial irregularities, but others are likely to finish the sector. “The new ordinance will empower the RBI to remove directors or the entire board in case of any financial irregularities and can also appoint administrators. These reforms should be welcomed. But other provisions will lead to disaster for the sector,” he said. “For instance, we have to list it as a company and anyone can take all shares and rule it against today’s scenario that irrespective of the share-holding, a member will have the right of only one vote. It means all the shareholders have equal rights, which will not be same once new provisions will be implemented,” Anaskar said. “Similarly, capital of cooperative bank shares can be increased by a single source which is called as share linkage on loan. It means the borrower has to buy 5% shares of the total amount against unsecured loan and 2.5% shares against secured loan. But now RBI will allow us to borrow by the way of debentures, bonds preferential shares etc. which is against the principles of co-operative movement,” he said. The co-operative movement of the state has a three-tier co-operative credit structure, led by the Maharashtra State Co-operative Bank, the apex body for all DCC banks. The district-level banks (DCCB) are in the middle and 21,214 Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) are at the bottom. Around 48.39 lakh borrowers of crop loan are from DCC banks, while members of PACS are around 1.09 crore, majorly farmers. The cooperative banks and societies play a major role in the state’s agriculture sector as well as rural economy. A majority of the DCC bank boards are under the control of Congress and NCP leaders. NCP chief spokesperson and minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said the BJP is working on its old agenda to end cooperative movement.“The BJP wants to end cooperative movement in the country, which is an alternative to capitalism,” Malik said.State Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said, “Even this year, the cooperative banks of the state have sanctioned 46% crop loan of the total target whereas commercial banks have sanctioned only 7% crop loan. But since PM Narendra Modi-led government has come to power, several such decisions have been taken to dismantle the cooperative movement.”BJP spokesperson Madhav Bhandari said the decision should be welcomed as it was going to safeguard the interest of depositors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/future-tense-for-co-operative-banks/story-B6zNDR8sYhq5LE5FOeh1hL.html

Mobile application-based cab operator Ola, which also operates autorickshaws in the city, on Wednesday made it mandatory to have a protective shield inside autorickshaws. “Autorickshaws are one of the most economical and widely used means of commute in our country.

Plastic gets torn easily and not enough garages are providing the material. We are waiting for directives from the state government on the operation of autorickshaws and taxis,” said Shashank Rao, leader of Mumbai Autorickshaw Taximen’s Union. “I have been operating an autorickshaw in the city for over 10 years now. Under the present situation due to Covid-19, it is very important to have a shield. Many auto drivers have spent their money to install the covers. I will also be installing it soon,” said Aslam Shaikh, a Ghatkopar resident.Black and yellow taxi owners are also placing protective shields. “We have asked taxi drivers to start placing it as protective measures. We have installed shields in 10 taxis so far.

25-06-2020||City||18 of 27 villages from Kalyan to get separate council||After a decade long wait, the villagers of 18 out of 27 villages in Kalyan Taluka will now get a separate council. On the backdrop of civic polls to be held later this year, the state government has passed a notification to form a separate municipal body for the 18 villages on Wednesday, while remaining nine villages will still be under Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC).The villagers of these nine villages have demanded to be separated from KDMC. The 18 villages will come under a new municipal body - Kalyan Suburb Municipal Council stated the notification. The state has also given 30 days to register any objections and suggestions on this notification with the Thane collector.Earlier in March, the Maharashtra State chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had announced that a separate municipal council for 18 villages will be formed, while the remaining nine villages will continue to be a part of KDMCThe 18 villages include Ghesar, Hedutane, Umbroli, Bhal, Dwarli, Manere, Vasar, Ashele, Nandivl Ambernath, Adivli- Dhokli, Daudi, Chinchpada, Pisavli, Golivali, Mangaon. Nilje, Sonarpada and Kole.The nine villages that remain under KDMC includes Ajade, Sagaon, Nandivli Panchanand, Dharivali, Sandap, Usarghar, Katai, Bhopar and Deslepada.The All Party Union (Sarvapakshiya Hakka Saurakshan Sangharsh Samiti) representing the 27 villages that have been fighting for a separate civic body for almost a decade, is, however, going to object this notification stating they want a separate municipal body for all 27 villages.“We have been fighting almost a decade now asking for a separate municipal body for the entire 27 villages. The demand from our side is the same. We will follow the procedure and sent our reply to the state,” said Gulab Vaze, representative of the All Party Union.The union had claimed that the state has tactfully kept the 9 villages in KDMC which is income-generating villages as there has been some development in real estate in these parts while the remaining 18 villages have completely languished.Recently the State election commission in a letter dated on June 19, had asked the KDMC to start preliminary works for the civic polls, which was slated to happen in October – November. Now with the resolution passed for the 18 villages, the civic body will have to redesign its wards by eliminating the 18 villages. Presently there are 122 wards in the KDMC, which includes the 27 villages.“Whether to include the 18 villages in KDMC while doing the preliminary works will depend on the further directions from the state election commissioner. We will check with the commission,” said Vijay Suryavanshi, commissioner KDMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/18-of-27-villages-from-kalyan-to-get-separate-council/story-guaHlhZYEaujkgUSXOmygJ.html

25-06-2020||Mumbai||‘Peak may have passed; gradual unlocking crucial to avoid spike’||With fewer cases of Covid-19 being reported in the city over the past few days, the state’s Covid-19 task force believes Mumbai might have crossed its peak between May 15 and May 31. Daily new numbers have recently plateaued, with 1,000 to 1,200 new cases as compared to the 1,200 to 1,700 that were reported previously. However, experts said Mumbai should exercise caution while lifting lockdown restrictions to avoid a repetition of Delhi, which has seen high load of cases following unlocking.On Wednesday, Mumbai recorded 1,118 new cases of Covid-19, raising the city’s case tally to 69,528. The death toll touched 3,964 with 120 new deaths reported on Tuesday. The number of active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai stands at 28,548. So far, the city has a recovery rate of 53.2%, with 37,007 patients being discharged upon recovery. The fatality rate in the city as of Saturday was 5.70% and the doubling rate is at 39 days.Dharavi, one of the city’s hotspots, reported only 10 cases on Wednesday, which is the third lowest number of cases it has reported in a day since the first week of April. Five cases were reported on Tuesday and seven were reported last Saturday. The total number of cases from Dharavi is 2,199 and its death toll is 81.Dr Shashank Joshi, member of the state-appointed Covid-19 task force, said, “Mumbai might have passed the peak from May 15 to May 31. Many deaths now are of those who got infected during that time. We may see a spurt in cases with lockdown easing up and new relaxations coming in, but we have to be very careful. If we have relaxations in a controlled manner, we will be in a very comfortable position to tackle the virus. Now, in case of Mumbai unlocking, it will also mean gradually allowing citizens to travel in local trains that is Mumbai’s lifeline. However, we have to have a slab of 10-10% to increase the travel in local trains.”A second wave by mid-July?Dr Joshi warned of a second wave in July. “If we start everything from July 1, we might have a second wave around July 15, but we need to be very mindful of this. Our local trains are very well operational. We can have more people travel in it step by step. We have many areas where the doubling rate is over 40-45 days, and we can think of more relaxations there, but where the doubling rate is less than 30 days, we should not give much relaxation,” he said.Dr Peehu Pardeshi of Tata Institute of Social Science (TISS) said the city should be prepared to re-impose restrictions in case of a second wave. “It was noted that several new hotspots of Covid cases were found after lockdown relaxations were announced. This should not be the case as the relaxations should be closely monitored and reversible if we witness a second wave. We need to also keep in mind the sentiment of citizens as the relaxations should not result in sudden crowding of areas. Phases of relaxations with strict monitoring and ensuring social distancing should be the way forward,” said Pardeshi.On June 2, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had issued detailed guidelines to ease restrictions in Mumbai in tandem with the state government’s ‘Mission Begin Again’ announced on May 31. BMC allowed easing of restrictions in a three-phased manner, from June 3, June 5 and June 8, which included allowing opening of some public spaces, non-essential shops and private offices. However, the current restrictions will remain in place till June 30, following which the state will review the situation in the city.Spike in MMR is threat to city’s flattening of the curveAccording to the state health department’s data, as of Tuesday, there are around 1.01 lakh Covid-19 cases in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) out of the total 1.39 lakh cases in Maharashtra. MMR accounts for 72% of the total cases in the state.Experts have pointed out that Mumbai’s economy is connected to its satellite cities, which make up the MMR. Dr Joshi said, “We can say Mumbai has plateaued today, but in MMR, with areas like Mira-Bhayander, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, we need to control the cases. Currently, Mumbai’s neighbouring cities are witnessing a peak, and they may settle down by July 15. We have to consider all this while unlocking.”Dr Joshi emphasised Mumbai was in “a very good position” with distancing norms being followed and the civic body systematically carrying out testing, tracing and quarantine of Covid-positive cases. “We have been cautious with opening up and should continue to do so, unlike Delhi. Delhi had very few cases compared to Mumbai, and I feel they unlocked too soon due to which today they have a load of cases,” he said.On the subject of lifting lockdown restrictions, BMC said it will wait on directions from the Central and state governments. “Earlier, lockdown was announced with certain relaxations up to June 30, and to implement anything after that we will require directions from the state government that will rely on the directions of the Central government until which status quo will be maintained,” said a BMC official on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/peak-may-have-passed-gradual-unlocking-crucial-to-avoid-spike/story-JM8qDsbt0wsMwhHxT5Ny1K.html
25-06-2020||Mumbai||Maratha quota now 12% for junior college admissions||The Maharashtra government has decided to reduce the reservation quota for students of the Maratha community from 16% to 12% for junior college admissions this academic year.The decision was taken following the order that was issued by the Bombay high court (HC), officials said.“We have decided to reduce reservation quota under the Social and Educational Backward Classes Act (SEBC) to 12% from 16% for junior college admissions (Class XI) for this academic year,” stated the government resolution issued by the school education department on Tuesday.The order is applicable for 15 municipal corporations — Mumbai, Thane, Navi Mumbai, Kalyan-Dombivli, Mira-Bhayander, Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi-Nizampur, Vasai-Virar, Panvel, Pune, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Nashik, Aurangabad, Nagpur and Amravati.School education secretary Vandana Krishna said, “SEBC quota has been reduced as per the orders of the HC. Also, online admission process for Class 11 is carried out only in these 15 corporations as there is no demand or need for the online admission process in rest of the state.”The erstwhile BJP- led state government has granted 16% reservation to the Maratha community by enacting the SEBC act, in government jobs and education in November 2018. The act was upheld HC on June 2019, but it said that the quantum of 16% was not justifiable and should be reduced to 12%-13%, as recommended by the state backward classes commission in its report as one of the main basis to grant reservation to the community.Later, it was challenged in the Supreme Court (SC). On February 5, SC, while hearing a bunch of petitions against Maratha reservation, refused to stay the HC order. The Apex court has now fixed the next hearing of the case on July 7.The state education department in its GR has also increased the quota for student with disabilities to 4% from the existing 3% for admissions in junior colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/maratha-quota-now-12-for-junior-college-admissions/story-u5wTMWzKk1jCVCPFYOYQNP.html
25-06-2020||Mumbai||State employees won’t get arrears of 7th pay commission this year||Employees of Maharashtra government will not get this year’s instalment to clear arrears of seventh pay commission. Struggling with the financial crisis, the state government has decided to defer the payment for a year. “We have decided to defer the second instalment as arrears of seventh pay commission for a year considering the adverse impact on the economy,” states the government resolution issued by the finance department on Wednesday.The state has decided to implement recommendations of the seventh pay commission from January 1, 2019. The arrears amount was divided into five annual instalments. This year’s instalment of ₹5,000 crore for its 18 lakh employees including 7 lakh pensioners was due on July 1, said a senior official from the finance department.Earlier, the state has deferred March month’s salary of its officers from Class A, B and C. The ongoing financial crisis has led the state government to declare a 67% cut in its spending for developmental works this fiscal year, in view of the estimated revenue losses of more than Rs 40,000 crore in March and April 2020 owing to the Covid-19 outbreak.The state, expecting the cumulative losses to be more than ₹50,000 crore in the current fiscal, has also decided to not take up new development schemes and scrap or defer the schemes that can be put on hold. Among other measures, the government has also decided to stop recruitment for government jobs, meaning that recruitment underway for 35,000 posts is unlikely now.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/state-employees-won-t-get-arrears-of-7th-pay-commission-this-year/story-6JDgtNLJPZn1J4Nj7KsM9K.html
25-06-2020||Mumbai||State reports sharpest 1-day spike of 3,890 Covid-19 cases||Maharashtra on Wednesday recorded its sharpest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases with 3,890 fresh infections, taking the total past 1.40 lakh cases to 142,900. The previous record single-day jump was on June 20 (3,874 new cases). The state also reported 208 more fatalities, taking the toll to 6,739. Mumbai recorded 1,118 new infections and 82 fatalities on Wednesday, inching closer to the 70,000 mark for cases at 69,528 total infections.Of the deaths reported on Wednesday, 72 occurred in the past 48 hours and 136 deaths were before that, the state health department said. Thirteen deaths were reported in Solapur, 10 in Nashik, nine in Navi Mumbai, eight in Jalgaon, five in Kalyan-Dombivli, three in Thane, one each in Ulhasnagar, Bhiwandi, Pimpri-Chinchwad, Akola, and Satara. The death of a person from another state was also reported.The state has been recording over 3,000 cases for over a week, but Mumbai, which has contributed the most to the state tally so far, has been seeing fewer cases, while Mumbai’s surrounding areas, such as Thane, Navi Mumbai, Vasai-Virar, Kalyan-Dombivli, Mira-Bhayander, are seeing more since last week.According to the state health department data, Thane city recorded 214 new cases on Wednesday, while Navi Mumbai recorded 340 new cases. Kalyan-Dombivli saw 268 new cases and Thane district recorded 220 new cases. Mira-Bhayander and Vasai-Virar recorded 163 and 121 new cases, respectively.Meanwhile, Pune recorded 425 more cases on Wednesday, while Pimpri-Chinchwad and Nashik saw 76 and 108 new cases respectively.

The state health department has already ramped up bed capacity and other health infrastructure in these areas to tackle increasing cases.In the past 14 days, Mumbai has recorded 16,861 cases and averaged 1,204 cases daily. A senior bureaucrat said that the figures are “good signs” for Mumbai, but the “concern” are new hotspots in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Senior officials said that poor contact tracing by respective municipal corporations are to be blamed for it.“These are good signs for Mumbai. We certainly hope that the trend continues and that there is no second wave in wake of the relaxations given. MMR is seeing a rise in cases, due to poor contact tracing by local bodies. The data we see shows that they do not go beyond the family. Unless contacts are traced thoroughly, we cannot have targetted testing,” said a senior bureaucrat requesting anonymity.A senior state government official said that the increasing case fatality rate in the state is a cause of concern. The rate in the state is at 4.72%, which is much higher than the country’s rate of around 3.18%. The official said, “There are 11 known variants of this virus. Eight of them lead to asymptomatic patients, while the three other strains lead to symptoms in patients. Out of these three, one causes fatalities. There needs to be a virology study on it for doctors to understand the rise in fatality rate,” he said. The state health department has sought drugs, including remdesivir, from the Centre to increase the recovery rate in the state.The state also discharged 4,161 patients on Wednesday, pushing the recovery rate to 51.64%, from 50.09% on Tuesday. The total number of patients discharged in the state so far stands at 73,792. The number of active cases in the state stands at 62,354.

With construction activities beginning to pick up pace with the central government many restrictions since May 4, work is returning to construction sites.The Uttar Pradesh government on May 29 had signed a memorandum of understanding with the national real estate development council (Naredco), an autonomous self-regulatory body under the aegis of Union ministry of housing and urban affairs, in order to employ at least 250,000 people who have returned to its cities from other states.“Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister Yogi Adityanath will present letters of employment and also interact with migrants to encourage them to work with motivation at new workplaces. We had assured the UP government to employ 250,000 migrants and now it is time to train them and engage them at different construction sites. We will provide jobs in next 2-3 months as the construction is starting at the sites,” said RK Arora president of the UP unit of Naredco. Naredco will submit a project report at the event to be held in Sector 94 on the site of project being developed by Supretech Supernova. PM and CM will interact with migrants via video-conferencing.According to Naredco, around 60% of out of the migrants will be employed in Noida, Greater Noida, Yamuna Expressway and Ghaziabad sites. “The remaining migrants will be employed in cities like Meerut, Lucknow and other districts. The developers are starting the construction at their sites after completing formalities required,” Harendra Yadav, a developer member of Naredco.The UP government has also shared another list of 900,000 returned migrant workers with Naredco.“The government wants to provide employment to returned migrant workers under its ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ project that aims to skill and employ at least 3 million returning migrant workers across the state,” said Satish Mahana UP industry minister. The central government has identified 116 districts across the country that have witnessed the return of migrants in large numbers. In UP there are 31 districts, where over than 35,000 migrants returned from Mumbai, Delhi and other big cities.“The government wants to provide jobs to who have lost their livelihood due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The government has identified and prepared a database of all those, who have lost jobs and returned to their home towns due to covid 19 pandemic. The government is trying to rehabilitate these migrants in the state,” said Dhirendra Singh BJP MLA from Jewar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/developers-to-employ-returned-migrants-at-sites-pm-to-inaugurate-project/story-MVl13ehBDCpajbQARAlpQL.html

25-06-2020||Gurugram||50 rapid antigen detection tests conducted in city, 100 tests in Gandhi Nagar today||Gurugram finally rolled out the rapid antigen tests, with the first batch of 50 people getting tested with the new kits in Sadar Bazar area on Wednesday. The plan, health officials said, was to conduct 100 tests in Gandhi Nagar area on Thursdays. “All the 50 antigen tests conducted at the malaria office in Jacobpura, Sadar Bazar, on Wednesday were negative. Of those tested, four had Influenza Like Illness (ILI) based on which the team collected their nasal and throat swabs for RT-PCR,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer. Approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), these tests look for specific protein associated with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19. The state health department has already placed an order for 100,000 kits.People who were tested included contacts of Covid-19 patients.The new rapid antigen test, developed by a South Korean company and manufactured in Manesar, is highly specific (99.3% to 100%) — meaning a positive result on the test is a “true positive” and does not need any confirmatory test.The sensitivity is between 50.6% to 84% depending on the viral load, meaning those who test negative might still have the infection and are advised to go for a test through the more reliable RT-PCR method if they show symptoms of the disease.Yadav said that if a person tests positive for coronavirus, they will be referred home isolation or immediately hospitalized based on the symptoms. “On Thursday, the rapid test numbers will be increased to 100 and it will be done in Gandhi Nagar area of the city,” he said.According to Yadav, to observe the trend of Covid-19 spread in the city, the antigen detection test will be done in different pockets of Gurugram . “Based on the test analysis, the department later will figure out a plan on how to go about with conducting more tests on a daily basis. Already, a serological survey to study community transmission of the virus has been launched. Routine RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) — often considered the gold standard in front-line testing for Covid-19 —tests will continue simultaneously,” said Yadav. The district’s health department till Tuesday had received 8,000 rapid antigen kits — which can deliver Covid-19 result within 15-30 minutes. Yadav said that the kits will be used in areas that are witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases. As per data, the most affected areas in Gurugram city at the moment are Chanderlok with 290 cases, Gandhi Colony having 190 Covid-19 cases, Tigra with 226 cases and Patel Nagar with 181 cases. To conduct antigen tests, which require safety precautions similar to RT-PCR tests, the department has trained at least seven lab technicians. The plan is to deploy Ayush doctors too. “Nineteen doctors from the Ayush department will be roped in to help the team conducting the antigen tests. They will be involved in contact tracing and finding suspected cases who require testing and also to determine whether a positive patient should be home isolated or hospitalised,” said Yadav.Last week, during a review meeting with Union home affairs minister Amit Shah on Covid-19 management in Delhi-NCR, Haryana was directed to use the antigen detection tests widely to cover more people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/50-rapid-antigen-detection-tests-conducted-in-city-100-tests-in-gandhi-nagar-today/story-OQ06BYcxCrHYmDPhUtHy6N.html
25-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: NHAI, PWD rectify infra to prevent water logging at Rajiv Chowk, Atul Kataria Chowk||The National Highway Authority of India (NHAI) on Tuesday installed an 18 metre pipe in the low lying area at Gurugram’s Rajiv Chowk to divert the water to a drain to prevent waterlogging during the monsoon at Rajiv Chowk at the U-turn towards civil secretariat.NHAI officials said the matter had been raised by Gurugram MLA Sudhir Singla during his visit to the site on Saturday, after which they took it up with a contractor and a pipe was installed to ensure water does not collect. Singla had visited Mahavir Chowk, Atul Kataria Chowk, Iffco Chowk, Signature Tower Crossing, Rajiv Chowk and Hero Honda Chowk on Saturday to take stock of measures by various civic agencies ahead of the monsoon.“As there is a low-lying area at Rajiv Chowk water gets collected there, which causes problems especially for two wheeler riders and pedestrians taking a U turn towards the Civil Secretariat, during rains. I have asked all agencies that wherever water logging takes place, pipes and pumps should be installed to divert the water into drains so there is no problem in monsoon,” said Singla. NHAI officials said all issues raised during the visit are being resolved. “The pipe will ensure that water does not collect at the spot on Rajiv Chowk,” said Vikas Malik, manager, NHAI. In a related development, the Public Works Department (PWD), which is getting constructed the Mahavir Chowk flyover, said they have pumped all the sewage that had got collected at the construction site. “This was possible after a lot of effort as no civic agency knew the source of this sewage and after hectic efforts we came to know this water was coming from pipes of Municipal committee from MDI Gurugram and areas around it. None of the agencies knew about the existence of these sewage lines as these had been laid back in the seventies. Now we have plugged the leak and removed the water,” said Rajeev Yadav, executive engineer, PWD, adding that there was no rainwater collected there.At Atul Kataria Chowk, PWD officials said they have connected the drains with master storm water drainage to prevent waterlogging at this spot. “We have connected the drains and now the problem of waterlogging will be resolved. We are also in the process of cleaning the area and removing the earth spread there, due to construction work”, said Yadav.Referring to the issue of waterlogging, Singla said he also visited the old city colonies and asked officials to take immediate measures. “We will also focus on measures to boost rainwater harvesting so that water doesn’t get wasted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-nhai-pwd-rectify-infra-to-prevent-water-logging-at-rajiv-chowk-atul-kataria-chowk/story-mgu29S29r3a5OduAUqKymM.html

I have discussed the issue with Padalkar and in no circumstances, his remarks can be justified. Padalkar has also agreed to take corrective steps,” said Fadnavis.Padalkar, a newly elected Maharashtra Legislative Council (MLC) member and Dhangar community leader, had said, “Pawar is coronavirus for Maharashtra. For all these years that he led Maharashtra, Pawar has oppressed bahujans.”Padalkar’s remarks triggered a political row as NCP workers in Marathwada burnt his effigy, while the party’s Pune and Mumbai unit threatened to launch state-wide stir on Thursday.The NCP leader while questioning Padalkar’s political standing, said, “He, till recently, abused Narendra Modi, but later joined the BJP for the MLC’s post. Padalkar will have to a pay price for his remarks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fadnavis-steps-in-to-contain-damage-after-bjp-mlc-likens-sharad-pawar-to-coronavirus/story-AbxwrEWE6URQLvBEwzBeQM.html
25-06-2020||Delhi||Only small fraction of patients reaching Covid centres in Delhi for screening||Only 438 patients who tested positive for Covid-19 were able to reach Covid Care Centres (CCC) for a clinical assessment — as mandated by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Saturday — on Monday and Tuesday due to lack of transportation, according to Delhi government data.There were 6,856 new cases added on Monday and Tuesday.The Delhi government has strongly opposed a June 20 order by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal -- all persons who test positive for Covid-19 are to be taken to CCCs for a clinical assessment, to determine if the patient should be recommended home isolation or be admitted to a facility -- on the grounds that it will be impractical to implement and put an unneccesary strain on infrastructure.According to the state government data, which HT has reviewed, 294 Covid-positive patients were screened across 19 CCCs on Monday. The number dropped to 144 on Tuesday.Data for Sunday — a day after the DDMA order was issued -- and Wednesday was not immediately available, but district officials said the turnout at the centres on Sunday was low.On Wednesday, districts continued to face difficulties in transporting patients to these centres and sending them home, if cleared for home isolation. The Capital’s 163 dedicated Covid-19 ambulances have already been burdened with the city recording an average of more than 3,000 cases a day over the last week. The East district administration on Wednesday even requisitioned DTC buses to ferry Covid-19 patients to care centres.Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, who holds temporary charge of the health ministry, wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah on Wednesday, urging him to revert to the previous system. District officials said the rule is mandatory since it has now been ordered by the Directorate General of Health Services as well, and needs to be enforced, but added that they were asking the police to intervene only in some rare cases. “It’s wrong to trouble a Covid-positive person by calling in the police. We are trying our best to convince people to go to centres for the clinical assessment. The use of force is a last resort and is seldom being used in this scenario,” said a government official who asked not to be named.“The number of Covid patients who are being screened at the CCCs is turning out to be very low. This is because it is practically impossible to bring everyone to these centres. A few asymptomatic patients were also unwilling to go, saying they did not see the rationale behind a second round of screening after testing positive through an RT-PCR test,” said a south district official on condition of anonymity.Reports showed that over the past two days, most patients who were screened at CCCs were at the one in the DDA flats in Narela and DUSIB flats in Dwarka Sector 16. Both centres screened 79 people on Monday and Tuesday. In Shahdara district’s CCC at the police quarters in Mandoli, 62 people were screened. At Teerapanth Bhawan in South district, just 61 underwent screening.Of the 19 CCCs in the city, there are at least eight facilities where no newly tested positive patients were screened on Monday and Tuesday. These include the CCCs in the Police Training School (PTS) Dwarka, Birla Mandir Dharamshala and Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg. Only between 10 and 12 people were screened at Care Centres in Bakkarwala and PTS Wazirabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/only-small-fraction-of-patients-reaching-covid-centres-in-delhi-for-screening/story-S8RCZ7u8FKQ3j17AaVTeEN.html

This year keeping in mind the Covid-19 crisis we don’t want to risk the lives of people so we have decided to restrict movement at these places,” said Jadhav.According to officials in Velhe taluka there are two Covid-19 active cases and 34 cases , while in Bhor, there are two active cases and 17 cases.Velhe and Bhor talukas receive incessant rains due to which many tourists visit Panseth, Warasgaon, Bhatghar and Niradevghar dams. Along with dams, forts like Torna, Rajgad, Rayri, Rohideshwar see a huge footfall.Regions of Bhor and Velhe taluka also have famous waterfalls like Madhe ghat, Dhanepacha, Baneshwar waterfalls and Dhyansehwar temple which is a major attraction during the weekend.Vinayak Devdhar, assistant police inspector, Sahayak Police Nirakshak of Velhe police station, Thane, said, “We will have strict police bandobast at all these places. Those who try to flout the rules will be penalised. It is our request to the public to support us.”On Wednesday, district collector Ram visited the Bhor district. He said, “Administrators, health officials and police are doing a great job by keeping people’s safety as a priority. Due to their efforts, we have managed to keep the cases in control. People should support us in keeping them safe.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/safety-first-no-treks-to-forts-this-year-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-UTgMlfBElZDWdaklbK8WQL.html

Some areas, declared as containment zones, have been under complete lockdown since the start even while most other parts of the city are being opened up under the government’s Unlock 1.0 plan.After 90 days under restrictions, residents of the areas, particularly in central parts of Pune, have become restless and disputes with police and civic authorities are often reported. Most of these areas are slums like Lohiyanagar, Parvati Darshan, and Tadiwala road where economic activity, including non-essentials shops, are still shut.Pune police on Tuesday held a meeting to discuss various issues, including ways to prevent residents from stepping out of their homes in these containment areas and maintaining law and order in other parts. Most of these areas under restrictions are still reporting huge number of Covid-19 cases on a daily basis. As on June 21, Lohiyanagar had 66 active and 312 cases while Tadiwala road has 151 active and 1,252 cases.“The major challenge is of keeping people inside containment zones like Lohiyanagar as they have been in complete lockdown state for the last 3 months,” said K Venkatesham, Pune police commissioner, in his tweet. The police commissioner also mentioned that crimes such as body offences are on the rise in some parts like Hadapsar, Yerawada and Chatuhshrungi areas.“We are working on this issue as there are several areas which have been under lockdown since the beginning and the PMC is providing them ration kits at their doorsteps. In some areas with the help of Special Police Officers (SPOs), our policemen have arranged whatever they needed directly to their homes. However, people are still a little restless in these containment zones which have been under lockdown since the beginning. At least 30 such areas in and around Pune city have been identified and we are working to solve the issues. Engaging with residents is the only way we can do what we are doing and we are bringing it to the notice of PMC officials and local politicians,” said Venkatesham.Sagar Abnawe, a resident of Lohiyanagar area, said, “It has become difficult for all of us to survive on a day-to-day basis, all the residents here belong to the labour class or below poverty line. We get to eat, only when we used to work and now none of us work. Earlier, we were getting ration kits, but now hardly any help is being provided to us. We are aware that the number of cases is increasing, but at the same time the government should figure out a way to lift the lockdown in our area.”The PMC on its part has decided to review containment zones every week instead of 15 days to open up areas where there are fewer cases.Shekhar Gaikwad, PMC commissioner, said, “We are working on alternative plans at the containment zones which are under lockdown since the beginning. All the necessary essential goods are been supplied regularly to the residents there, if they have any complaints, they can contact our PMC teams deployed in their areas.”Dr Soumitra Pathare, consultant psychiatrist, director, Centre for Mental Health, Law and Policy at ILS, said, “People have been stuck inside their homes from the past three months, so it is normal they are getting restless. So it is a challenge for the police department to control the movement of people.”“The houses of people in the containment zones are small. Due to the lockdown, all family members are at home and there can be fights and unhappiness among members. So the only solution is allowing them restricted movement in a safe manner,” said Dr Pathare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/90-days-under-lockdown-has-residents-clashing-with-officials-in-containment-zones/story-G1OQ3ZImP5BG8H8Zdnca7O.html
25-06-2020||Delhi||Kejriwal, Sisodia ask Centre to roll back rule mandating visit to Covid centre||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday asked the Centre to withdraw an order mandating every individual diagnosed Covid positive through a swab test to be taken to a Covid care centre (CCC) for clinical assessment of symptoms, equating it with “detention”, even as deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia wrote to Union home minister Amit Shah to roll back the directive which he said was putting a burden on the administrative machinery fighting the pandemic.“I have received many requests to reverse the home isolation-related order, especially from people with mild symptoms or no symptoms, because it is not feasible. If the police and district administration arrive as somebody’s residence and takes that person to a Covid centre, it is equivalent to 15 days’ detention,” Kejriwal said.The new health assessments protocol formalised by the administration on Monday says every new Covid-19 patient must visit a government facility, a process that requires special ambulances and increased deployment of medical staff, and raises the risk of infection among anyone who is involved in the exercise. “Suppose, someone’s 80-year-old mother gets Covid-infected, and she is asymptomatic or has mild symptoms, how can she be taken to a quarantine centre and why? At home, she will be taken care of better by her children. Those who can be treated at home should be isolated at home and those who need medical attention can be taken to hospital. Why force everyone into a Covid centre. Such an order is not correct.” the CM said after inaugurating a 100-bed covid health centre set up at a banquet hall attached to Lok Nayak Hospital in central Delhi.Kejriwal said, “Why should a person with high fever be forced to stand in a queue for assessment of Covid symptoms when that can be done at home? The Delhi government and central government are working in cooperation with each other. I would like to request the Centre to roll back the order.”Earlier in the day, Sisodia urged Shah to roll back the order that has sparked a row. “It’s not a matter of the Amit Shah model versus Arvind Kejriwal model of fighting Covid-19. It’s about ensuring minimum inconvenience to the public and also that the administrative machinery fighting the pandemic is not overburdened,” Sisodia said at a briefing via a video conference, a day after the Delhi government said in a letter to the L-G that the old system of assessing Covid-19 patients at their residence to determine if they are fit for home isolation must be brought back.Also, on Wednesday, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) – chaired by lieutenant-govenor (L-G) Anil Baijal – wrote to the six-member expert committee set up by the L-G earlier this month, seeking help on the matter and directed them to submit a proposed standard operating procedure (SOP) by Thursday.The letter, which HT has seen, said: “The subject of the letter (SOP for management of patients who have tested covid positive) is self-explanatory for consideration by the advisory group… I am directed to request you to kindly consider the issues raised in the letter (attached) of the deputy chief minister urgently and submit a proposed SOP in this regard in 24 hours.”The six-member advisory group is led by Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). A senior official in the DDMA said, “These are technical things and demand a scientific approach. So, the DDMA has written to the expert committee seeking guidance.”Sisodia, who has been holding the additional charge of the health portfolio after health minister Satyendra Jain tested Covid-19 positive and is undergoing treatment, said the rule to visit a CCC was causing chaos.“Delhi is reporting over 3,000 Covid-19 positive cases daily. We have written to the L-G, explaining how his directive is causing chaos. We have urged him to roll back his decision. The district authorities are in the process of arranging buses to adhere to the order and they are overburdened. We have requested the L-G to preside over a meeting of the state disaster management authority at the earliest. However, we have not got any response yet,” Sisodia said.Delhi on Wednesday reported 3,788 new cases, taking the overall count to 70,390. The health bulletin reported 64 deaths, pushing the count to 2,365.The Delhi government was earlier conducting a similar assessment by sending health officials to residences of Covid-19 patients.But last Friday, Baijal scrapped the home isolation practice and issued a controversial order making a five-day institutional quarantine mandatory for all patients, including those with mild symptoms who were eligible for home quarantine. The order was, however, reversed the following day after furore.The rollback of Friday’s order, however, came with the condition that all patients should be taken to CCCs for a clinical diagnosis.The official notification issued on Monday by the director-general of health services (DGHS), Delhi, specified that all those who tested positive through the RT-PCR test should be taken to CCCs for a clinical diagnosis of their symptoms. Those who tested positive through rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) are to be assessed in the clinics.The order said a medical officer is empowered to take a call on whether a Covid-19 patient should be sent to a hospital or a Covid-19 Health Centre (CHC) or can undergo self-isolation at home.A separate team will visit the residence of a Covid-19 patient to check if facilities required for self-isolation, such as a room with a separate toilet, etc, were available so that others in the family do not get infected, the order said.Jugal Kishore, head, community medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital, said: “If many Covid-19 patients visit CCCs, it will create multiple problems. It increases the exposure risk for healthcare workers; attendants, who accompany Covid-19 patients in ambulances; and also ambulance drivers, among others. Besides, a Covid-19 positive case can multiply to three in no time. In this context, it’s a logistically better option to send an equipped team to a Covid-19 patient’s residence.”The Bharatiya Janata Party criticised the Delhi government for the requests sent to the Union mister and L-G. “The situation in Delhi came under control only after the central government intervened. The Aam Aadmi Party government is politicising the issue of Covid patients being sent to care centres for clinical assessment because it exposes their failure on the healthcare infrastructure front,” said BJP’s Delhi unit president Adesh Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kejriwal-sisodia-ask-centre-to-roll-back-rule-mandating-visit-to-covid-centre/story-S8zBEzPtCmCnuILRp7mBuJ.html
25-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi has seen three Covid nodal officers since crisis began||Ever since the Covid-19 crisis started in the Capital in March, the city administration has seen at least three Covid-19 nodal officers and three new principal secretaries in key departments managing the pandemic in Delhi, government records show. On Monday, the services department, after the approval of Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, appointed 1990-batch IAS officer Bhupinder Singh Bhalla as principal secretary (home) and designated him the “nodal officer for the overall management of Covid-19” in Delhi. Bhalla replaced 1988-batch IAS officer Satya Gopal who was the additional chief secretary (home) in the Delhi government. A Delhi government spokesperson on Wednesday said that in the last three months, key officers involved in the management of corona crisis have been frequently changed without taking the elected government into confidence. The L-G’s office in its response said that Baijal and the Central government have rather augmented Delhi’s team of top Covid-19 officials by requisitioning senior bureaucrats to the Capital. As per records, Satya Gopal, who was the additional chief secretary (home), was the first top officer to be made the nodal officer for Covid-19 in Delhi. However, on June 7, he was replaced by principal secretary (health and family welfare) Vikram Dev Dutt. But, with Monday’s order, the nodal officer was changed for the second time and now Bhalla is managing the task. Similarly, the health department has also seen several changes. Till mid-April, the department was being led by secretary (H&FW) Padmini Singhla. On April 15, the L-G appointed Rajesh Prasad as Singhla’s boss in the position of principal secretary (H&FW). Then on June 7, Prasad was removed from the post and Vikram Dev Dutt took over. The Delhi government spokesperson said, “Removing officers from important posts without any reason affects the morale of all officers who are all working very hard during this crisis. It also disturbs the chain of command as every new officer has to first get a hang of all the ongoing efforts. Continuity of the officers in such key positions is very important so that the understanding of the crisis developed by them is utilised to fight the pandemic proactively.”To this, the L-G office said what is being done for Covid management in Delhi is “actually just the opposite” to what the Delhi government is claiming. “We would like to highlight that it was the L-G who in the past few weeks has brought in officers from the municipal corporations in Delhi to aid the government. Also, several senior bureaucrats have also been deputed in Delhi from other union territories by the government of India to help the Delhi government,” said a spokesperson in the L-G office. When it comes to hospitals, the medical director of Lok Nayak hospital, which is Delhi’s biggest Covid-19 hospital, has also been changed thrice since the hospital started treating Covid-19 patients. After initially overseeing the creation of the isolation wards in the hospital Dr Kishore Singh was removed from the position of the medical director. Keeping the extraordinary situation in mind, despite having crossed the age limit of 62 years, former director of the hospital Dr JC Passey was appointed as medical director of the consolidated Lok Nayak campus -- including GB Pant hospital, Guru Nanak eye centre, and Maulana Azad Medical College. He too was removed from the post, allegedly after the central government sought clarification from the Delhi government on why he had been appointed as MD despite having crossed the age of 62. Later, Dr Suresh Kumar from the department of medicine took over the charges as medical director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/city-has-seen-three-covid-nodal-officers-since-crisis-began/story-9gfre6zmOISQXxufHzs9JJ.html
25-06-2020||Delhi||Nursing staff at GTB Hospital double up as human couriers||Until May 29 afternoon, when the government designated East Delhi’s 1,500-bedded Guru Teg Bahadur(GTB) hospital as a fully Covid facility, Aakash Sharma worked at its emergency department as a nursing orderly. His colleague Sarita Yadav was posted at the gynaecology ward. Now that the hospital is treating only Covid-19 cases, Sharma and Yadav are now doubling as human couriers to help relatives of patients deliver their messages and personal items.Due to poor mobile phone connectivity in some parts of the building and a ban on the entry of non-medical employees inside wards, these couriers are very much in demand among relatives of Covid patients.GTB hospital is Delhi’s second-largest Covid hospital. The biggest exclusive coronavirus treatment facility is Lok Nayak hospital in Central Delhi with 2,000 beds. As the hospital is admitting only Covid patients, at least 10 nursing orderlies earlier with outpatient departments, surgery and other units are now working as messengers. Working in 8-9 hour shifts, Sharma and Yadav sit behind the police barricades along with security guards, waiting to receive messages or items from the relatives of patients. Wrapped in sanitised polythene bags with names of patients and ward number neatly written in bold and upper case, the packets they deliver could be a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, a handwritten note, an extra set of clothes, a prayer book, a religious thread or a bottle of hair oil.While most patients have mobile phones, there are some -- elderly or critically ill -- who do not or cannot use one because of their medical condition. They rely on people such as Sharma and Yadav to pass on their messages. ‘According to the health department, there were 265 Covid patients at the hospital on Wednesday.  Explaining how they work, Sharma said, “We wait at least 30 minutes to collect a bunch of items to be taken inside. We ask the relatives to write the name of the patient on the packet. Our job is to take it inside. We are proud of our jobs during this pandemic. The relatives thank us when they get a confirmation from the patient that the items have been delivered.” Sharma has delivered everything from medical papers to spectacles to prayer books and mobile phones.Outside the Blood Transfusion Centre building, which leads to the hospital’s isolation wards, the hospital’s security has placed four barricades of Delhi Police. There are around 250 patients inside. Rajinder Singh, a security supervisor at the gate, and his men stop every relative from crossing the barricades. “We explain that even they will be at a risk if they go inside. They all want to go in. Some are rude and argue. We ask them to hand over the items to designated employees. These people are standing here with us in this hot sun only to help the relatives. The package will definitely reach the patient,” Singh said.On Wednesday morning, Dheeraj Kumar, 21, had gone to the hospital with a bottle of hair oil for his mother. “My mother uses this specific hair oil every morning. It is part of her routine. She could not get it in the hospital. I told her over the phone I have got it. She was happy,” Kumar said while handing over the packet to Yadav over a layer of police barricades, which ensures social distancing. Another relative, Harjit Singh, stood behind Kumar with a cell phone charger. Singh was worried when his mother’s phone was switched off. She was admitted to the facility on Monday. “I called the hospital’s helpline number and they confirmed that she was fine. But they could not connect me to her. I came to the hospital on Tuesday and was told by an employee (Sharma’s colleague also working as a courier), that my mother had forgotten her phone charger. I will hand this (cell phone charger) over to them. It will reach her in half an hour, and I can still stay connected with her,” Harjit said. Medical director Dr Sunil Kumar said they want to ensure patients and relatives do not face any harassment. “We cannot allow anyone from outside inside the wards. Our nursing orderlies across all wards are there to help. People should understand and cooperate,” he said.Though the hospital has allowed all patients to use phones, at least three relatives HT spoke to said connectivity in the upper floors was a problem, making it almost impossible to speak to the patients or doctors.Anuj Singh, a guest teacher at the government school in Chandni Chowk, said it was difficult to get an update from the doctors about her husband’s health. She said, “My husband told me over the phone that his oxygen level dropped rapidly. I have come here but they are not allowing me inside. I want to speak to the doctors but I am not able to get in touch with them.”Dr Sunil Kumar said they have started a facility for patients to get regular updates from the hospital. “Our doctors work in shifts. It may not be possible for doctors to take every call and respond to the patients. It is also not practical to let all relatives inside the wards. There is a dedicated command centre that has information about every patient. The command centre’s phone number is pasted across the hospital. Our doctors send information to the centre. Relatives can just call up the centre to find out what the doctor has advised. Apart from this, there is another number to know real-time health updates about patients.” The 24*7 helpline for information related to patients at GTB hospital is 9625900550.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nursing-staff-at-gtb-hospital-double-up-as-human-couriers/story-kVJqjY9CW0dvUYMVqgIX6H.html
25-06-2020||Delhi||Bedlam as patients refuse to travel to Covid-19 centre in crowded ambulance||The government’s new guidelines that every new Covid-19 patient be taken to a Covid Care Centre (CCC), to assess if they need home isolation or hospitalisation, triggered chaos at Vasant Kunj’s B-1 block containment zone on Tuesday night as at least 15 patients refused to visit a CCC at YMCA near Connaught Place, locals and police said.The patients were reluctant to travel together in the ambulance arranged by the district administration, saying they were afraid of contracting a “heavier viral load from other infected persons”. Many demanded that they should be allowed to remain in home isolation or permitted to hire a private ambulance if their visit to the CCC was mandatory, senior police officers privy to the development said.Follow latest updates on coronavirus here Doctors, however, refuted the residents’ claim that they might contract a more virulent strain by travelling with other infected persons.“If two Covid positive patients were in close proximity with each other, it will not influence the disease pattern. If the virus is inside a body, then the severity of symptoms will depend on the affected individual’s response to the disease. Mild symptomatic cases will not turn severe merely by coming in contact with a severely symptomatic patient,” Dr Srikant Sharma, senior consultant, medicine, Moolchand Hospital, said.The order directing the mandatory screening of all Covid patients at CCCs was issued by lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal on Monday and has been opposed by the Delhi government.On Wednesday, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said they would request the L-G to withdraw the order, because sending each and every patient to a CCC would result in chaos.Also read: India’s largest coronavirus facility shapes up in DelhiPatients and their families started objecting to the mandatory visits around 9pm, when the ambulance reached the containment zone and all patients were asked to get in. When the resistance continued for more than an hour, district officials asked local police to intervene.Officers from the Vasant Kunj North police station reached the containment zone and requested patients to comply, and warned them of legal action if they failed to do so. “Even then, only five patients got into the ambulance and visited the CCC by around 10.30pm,” Ingit Pratap Singh, additional deputy commissioner of police (southwest) said.On the other hand, patients and their family members said some of the positive patients were elderly and required attendants.They also pointed out that none of the 15 patients was symptomatic.Also read: Herd immunity can be achieved at 43%, new study on Covid-19 finds“My husband is 78-years-old, weak and has had a knee replacement. He needs help walking. I was not comfortable with sending him in the ambulance, along with other infected persons as it might expose him to a higher viral load. The doctor who called us insisted that he should be sent to the YMCA CCC despite us requesting him to either allow us home isolation or to arrange a private ambulance on our own,” the wife of an elderly patient, who was shifted to a private hospital by his family members in the night itself, said.The father of another patient, a 31-year-old chemist who was among the five to visit the CCC, said, “No medical team had come along with the ambulance. As the ambulance looked shabby and unhygienic, we were reluctant to send our son in it. But when the police officers warned us of legal action, we had no choice but to comply.”Also read: Door-to-door survey in Delhi to map coronavirus spreadSome patients also claimed they were waiting for the ambulance since afternoon and it only arrived by 9pm.“The positive patients included young women. Their families refused to send them off in the night,” a police officer, who had intervened in the matter said.The district magistrate (DM) of New Delhi was not available for comment as calls and text messages sent to her remained unanswered.The local residents’ welfare association (RWA) distanced itself from the incident and its officials refused comment.On Wednesday, 14 patients were taken to the CCC in two ambulances arranged by the district administration. “The doctors examined us and asked us to remain in home isolation. Seven patients were sent in each ambulance. All of us returned home and have isolated ourselves,” a 46-year-old patient, who along with her husband and 21-year-old daughter had tested positive for Covid-19, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/police-intervene-as-vasant-kunj-patients-refuse-to-go-to-covid-centre-in-crowded-ambulance/story-yWC6KP4Q4CbFtSk3EXG00N.html
25-06-2020||Delhi||10k beds, 18k tonnes of ACs: What to expect in Delhi’s biggest Covid facility||Five rows each of 16 iron cots -- topped with mattresses covered with un-creased white bedsheets, neatly folded white blankets and thin pillows with blue covers -- are laid out at a distance of five feet from each other. On one side of each bed stands a grey plastic chair and on the other side rests a plastic stool with a sealed water bottle and a small soap atop it.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe mud floor is bare, and from the high roof hangs slow-moving fans, which would offer little comfort from the humidity but for the cool breeze flowing in from outside after a light drizzle.On Wednesday, this was a patients’ section up on display at the campus of Radha Soami Satsang Beas in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur, which is set to be the biggest Covid-19 temporary hospital in India with over 10,000 beds.“The mud floor will be covered by carpets and then topped with vinyl sheets for easy cleaning. The hospital will be cooled by 18,000 tons of air-conditioners,” said BM Mishra, district magistrate (south), even as workers began spreading vinyl sheets at one corner of the facility.The Delhi government had taken over the campus, roughly the size of 22 football fields in its effort to ramp bed strength and add medical infrastructure to combat the rapidly rising cases of the coronavirus disease in the city. The Delhi government is seeking to further increase the number of beds available for patients by setting up makeshift hospitals in 40 hotels and 77 banquet halls. The idea is to add 15,800 beds for sick patients. Five hundred converted railway coaches will add another 8,000 beds for the city’s Covid-19 patients.On Tuesday, home minister Amit Shah had tweeted that a large part of the facility would be operational by Friday and manned by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP).THREE SEPARATE SECTIONSSonalika Jiwani, IAS officer and sub-divisional (SDM) of Mehrauli, said the facility is divided into three sections: the largest for the patients, another for nurses and doctors, and the third will serve as the command section.“For patients, there will be 116 sections of 88 beds each. In the first phase, we’ll have 2,000 beds ready by Thursday. The entire facility will be ready by the first week of July,” she said.By Wednesday, dozens of large air-conditioners were already installed even as more were on their way. With the air-conditioners yet to be functional, the site was serviced by the fans hanging from long poles. While there is one fan on an average for every three beds, they will practically be useless for most patients going by how far the beds are placed from one another.THE FACILITIESEvery patient will have a bed, a stool, a chair, a small plastic cupboard, a dustbin and utensils, and will be given a toiletry kit. The beds will either be the foldable iron cots, or ones manufactured using cardboard.“Individual phone and laptop charging facility will be available for each bed. Patients can also bring their laptops, but for any video or audio application, they will have to use headphones,” said DM Mishra.Food will be served to the patients by volunteers who will roll them on trolleys along the rows of beds. “The Satsang is capable of cooking food for three lakh people a day. So, that will not be a problem,” said the DM.TOILETSThere are 600-odd toilets at the centre with 70 portable toilets -- including three special ones for physically challenged people -- stationed outside. “We will bring more portable toilets. The aim is to have one toilet for every 10 patients at least,” said the DM.Sanjeev Tiwari, the operations head of YLDA India Pvt Ltd, the firm hired by DUSIB to set up portable toilets, said that each toilet can be used about 200 times before the waste needs to be taken away. “Suction vehicles will be ready to take away the waste and make the toilets usable immediately. The toilets will be cleaned twice a day and once at night,” said Tiwari.The DM said that the sanitation work will be carried out by an agency to be hired by South Delhi Municipal Corporation. “All the workers will wear PPE suits. We are working out a plan to ensure there is minimal interaction between the workers and the patients,” said the officer.For uninterrupted water supply, the government has installed hydrants for the underground reservoir facility that has a capacity of 1.7 lakh litres. “The water supply capacity has been augmented. The Delhi Jal Board will check samples five times a day to ensure that the quality of water is good,” said Raghav Chadha, the DJB’s vice-chairman who visited the place on Wednesday.RELATIVES WON’T BE ALLOWEDRelatives of patients won’t be allowed inside the gates. “We would prefer if they can send the patients here in ambulances, but even if they bring them themselves, they’ll have to handover the patients to us at the gates and leave,” said DM Mishra.To handle the admission and discharge of patients, the authorities will use an e-hospital app that is being developed by the National Informatics Centre, said the DM. A team will work on 400 computers at the centre, he said.The officer said that MTNL has been asked to provide landline and internet connection at the facility. “We have also requested a telephone tower firm to install requisite towers nearby so that the patients do not have problems in browsing the internet,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/10-000-beds-18-000-tonnes-of-acs-what-to-expect-in-delhi-s-biggest-covid-facility/story-s3oKBP6IqzlauUlVUECJHN.html
25-06-2020||Delhi||DU admission: Aspirants unable to procure OBC/EWS certificates owing to pandemic shutdown||Those seeking admission under the other backward class (OBC) and economically weaker section (EWS) categories to undergraduate and postgraduate courses at Delhi University (DU) colleges have a new hurdle to surmount -- of getting new certificates attesting to their eligibility issued amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Aspirants said government attested certificates, issued on or after March 31, 2020, are mandatory to get an admission under these categories.A group of teachers have also written to the administration asking that candidates be admitted based on previously issued certificates in the backdrop of the pandemic. DU, as a rule, demands certificates issued on or after March 31 in the year of admission. The university has allowed candidates to upload the acknowledgement slip of certificate application with the admission form, and stipulated that the new certificate be produced at the time of admission.But Ananya Mandal, 18, seeking admission to BA (Hons) in Economics, said she had visited the subdivisional magistrate’s (SDM) office in Mehrauli for getting an OBC certificate. “I was told that we will have to apply online since the staff in the office was occupied with Covid-19 duty. I tried to fill the form online on the doorstep delivery website but that’s not working properly. Even if I apply online, officials from the SDM’s office will visit my home for verification. This will compromise the safety of my family members from the pandemic. Why can’t we take admission with the previously issued certificate?” she said.Sonalika Jiwani, SDM Mehrauli, said the website is working and they are receiving applications. “However, our staff have been diverted to Covid duty and therefore we are not being able to send them for verification work. There can be some delay but we are trying to issue these certificates,” she said.Citing the fact that many students will not be able to apply for new certificates online, DU’s SC, ST and OBC teachers’ association on Tuesday wrote to DU vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi that candidates be admitted upon furnishing a self-declaration and a previously issued certificate. “The nationwide lockdown was announced before March 31 this year to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, due to which the government and non-government officials remained away from work for a long time. Many DU aspirants seeking admissions under the OBC category or any other category could not get an updated certificate issued this year. Many candidates do not have access to the internet to apply online. Hence, in this situation, candidates should be allowed to take admission this year with the previously issued certificates. They can submit a new certificates once the situation improves,” Hansraj Suman, chairperson of the association, said in the letter.Suman said several other candidates are facing similar issues in getting EWS certificates. “Many candidates from different parts of the country approached us saying they are unable to apply for the certificates online. Many living in rural areas do not know how to apply online. The number of applications under OBC and EWS are very few as of now,” he said.By Wednesday evening, 44,000 paid applications were received for admissions to undergraduate courses. Of these, 5,600 were under OBC and 700 under the EWS category.Similarly, of the 15,958 paid applications for postgraduation courses, 2,900 were under the OBC category and only 489 under the EWS category. “Last year, the number of applications under the OBC was more than 16,000 within a week of admissions starting. But this time it’s not even 10% of that figure. The number of EWS applications were low last year as the category was just introduced. But it should have risen this year,” Suman said. Shobha Bagai, dean of admissions, DU, said candidates should at least apply online for the new certificates. “Both OBC and EWS certificates can be applied and issued online in many states. At least aspirants can upload the application slip with the form.

25-06-2020||Delhi||First patients arrive at rail coach isolation facility in Delhi||Two Covid-19 positive patients were shifted to the railway coaches-turned isolation wards at the Shakurbasti station washing shed on Wednesday -- the first ones to check into a railway facility across the city. In all, 503 railway coaches have been turned into makeshift Covid-19 isolation wards and are stationed at nine different stations in Delhi.“First patient arrived at Shakur Basti COVID Care Center of Railways in New Delhi. We are committed to provide all necessary help in this fight against COVID-19,” railways minister Piyush Goel tweeted. Senior northern railways officials refused to share the details of the two patients and said that the number of patients in the isolation coaches may increase by night. The train coaches facility is meant only for patients with very mild to moderate symptoms, they said. A detailed standard operating procedure (SOP) to be followed by Railways, Army Medical Corps and the Delhi government for the Covid care centres in train coaches have also been issued. The SOPs details the roles that various agencies, including the railways and Delhi government, will play while running the isolation facilities in 503 coaches. A reception centre has been opened at the Shakurbasti station for the administration of the Covid care coaches and the patients. An emergency control room has also been set up at the site by the railways. This will be manned 24x7 by the railway officials for coordinating and providing assistance. As per the SOPs, doctors and paramedic staff in the isolation coaches are to be deployed by the Army Medical Corps. “The coaches at Shakurbasti have been placed under a shed and fans have been provided in each coupe for optimum air circulation and better temperature control, said Deepak Kumar, chief public relations officer (CPRO) of Northern Railway. He said several arrangements have been made in the isolation coaches as per the agreement between the Delhi government and the Ministry of Railways. Kumar said northern railways will be responsible for the basic infrastructure and maintenance of the premises, apart from cleaning and sanitisation of platforms, providing housekeeping materials (linen and blankets), management of bio-toilets, power and electric supply arrangements, water, communication facilities, signage and marking of different areas. “Supply of oxygen cylinders and catering in the isolation coaches will also be done by the railways. While the Railway Protection Force (RPF) personnel will secure the railway station premises and the platform areas where the coaches are placed, the Delhi Police will secure the outside and adjoining areas of the station,” said Kumar. Since the isolation coaches are handed over to the local administration, the identification of patients, their transportation, admission and discharge will be taken care of by the health department of the state government. The patients in the isolation coaches are to be treated as per the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) protocol. In case the health of patients in isolation coaches deteriorate, they will be shifted to Covid healthcare centre in an ambulance provided by the DGHS or hospital, said the CPRO. Railways officials said that Bhagwan Mahavir Hospital in Pitampura is the primary hospital attached to the isolation coaches. The hospital would provide the requisite medicines, medical equipment and material along with coach attendants. Coach sanitation and waste segregation and disposal will also be the responsibility of the hospital, a press statement released by the northern railways said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/first-patients-arrive-at-rail-coach-isolation-facility/story-UlhYJ9nuNgJ0HAfKum3glI.html
25-06-2020||Delhi||In 100 days of Covid, many lessons for Lok Nayak hospital||Four days after the city reported its first case of Covid-19 on March 2, Lok Nayak hospital had sprung into action to take on the virus challenge.The health hub had immediately set aside 11 isolation rooms for Covid-19 patients, with the hospital admitting its first Covid-19 patient on March 17. In the next 100 days, Lok Nayak hospital had treated 3,760 Covid-19 patients – most with severe infection. Now, as the city reports more than 3,000 cases of the virus daily, the 2,000-bed hospital has been converted into a Covid-19 only treatment facility, making it the biggest such health hub in the state and Delhi government’s prime weapon against the virus.The hospital also helped fill a gap in the procedure by offering dialysis for Covid patients and also helping in deliveries of Covid-19 positive women.“We have provided 1,130 dialysis sessions to Covid-19 positive patients – the highest in north India. So far, there have been 144 babies born to Covid-19 positive mothers – 60 through c-section and 84 through normal deliveries. Our doctors, nurses, and staff have worked tirelessly to provide patient care,” said Dr Suresh Seth, medical director of the hospital.Starting with the wards in the emergency block of the hospital, the entire hospital was converted into a Covid-19 facility by April. The out-patient clinics were initially moved to the segregated orthopaedic block of the hospital and then completely shut by March-end. Patients already under treatment at the hospital started being shifted to Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital in Dilshad Garden. The hospital set up beds in their out-patient clinic area as well.“This was unthinkable. I had never imagined that the scale of the outbreak would be this big. We had set aside some isolation rooms and one ward for Covid-19 patients. I would have thought that this would be enough. The hospital had 107 ventilators, I never imagined we might need more,” said Dr Kishore Singh, the then medical director of the hospital.The hospital’s only isolation ward — with its own separate elevator — had been created during the H1N1 outbreak of 2009-10.One of the doctors who worked in the ward, remembered, “At that time, we just had one-floor with its own OPD for patients with flu-like symptoms. There were about 18 ICU beds and that’s all we needed. PPE kits were to be worn only inside the ICU and in the general area we used to just wear masks and gloves. A medicine -- Tamiflu – was already available and all doctors working in the H1N1 area were put on it. After one batch of doctors finished their duties, the fear for the others was less. In this case, people are getting more scared day by day.” Healthcare workers were the first to be impacted by Covid-19, with several cases being reported from among the community in the first two months, all of which were traced back to hospitals or contact with other healthcare workers. “We had anticipated an increase in the number of cases. But this rapid exponential surge in the number of cases has definitely caught us a little off-guard. At the time, we thought that there would be maybe 50-100 cases a day. A committee formed by the CM had said that we should be ready for handling 1,000 cases a day. But, we did not imagine a scenario beyond that,” said Dr JC Passey, who had been the director of the hospital for 49 of the 100 days, while it was transitioning to become a complete Covid-19 facility.In the 100 days, the hospital has had to learn hospitality. “We were not used to providing toiletries and buckets to patients, meals as well as snacks. These were earlier taken care of by the relatives of the patients. Initially, we had trouble in estimating and understanding what might be needed where,” said a nurse from the hospital, on condition of anonymity.These were uncharted territories for the hospital and they have been troubleshooting as and when problems arise. When they faced complaints of families not being able to communicate with patients, they set up a help-desk with tablets to connect them digitally.“We have started with ten tablets today (Wednesday). And, we will be adding one tablet in each ward slowly. All the relatives of the patient can come to the help desk and video call their family members,” said Dr Kumar.Delhi has been reporting over 3,000 cases a day and there are 124 hospitals – both government and private – that treat Covid-19 patients. The government is also working on setting up makeshift hospitals in hotels, banquet halls, stadiums, and railway coaches. Almost 15,000 people with the infection are in home isolation as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/in-100-days-of-covid-many-lessons-for-lok-nayak-hospital/story-xgKhFnoYgfZrehEHSnXwbJ.html

25-06-2020||Gurugram||Unlock tales: With 50% rent, storage spaces are a win-win for both tenants and landlords||Exorbitant rents, salary deductions, job insecurity — times are tough! So how does one survive in such difficult circumstances? Well, young professionals have found a way by relocating their stuff to storage facility for a month or two, till they return from their home towns.Social media timelines are filled with posts by professionals offering to keep belongings of others at their rented space for 50% or a lesser amount. Anish Bakshi, who had posted about one such storage facility on a Gurugram group on Facebook, says, “The idea is just to help out people who are being made to pay full rent for their rooms in Gurugram, even though that they are not living here anymore because most organisations have given work from home (as an option or mandate). We are offering storage in our flats. I’ve mostly received enquiries from bachelors who are moving or have already moved to their home towns.”A 22-year-old marketing manager in Gurugram, Anamika Manhas, sharing her experience, says, “I couldn’t move to the new house and there was a lot of family pressure to return to my home town, Jammu. I flew two days before lockdown. It’s been three months that I’m here now, and all my stuff was at my rented place and the notice period was over too. I couldn’t physically come and move my stuff (clothes, kitchenware, etc). So, when I found out about this service, I felt it was very helpful. I paid around ₹4,000 for a month and my stuff is all safe.”  For Varun Kataria, who owns flats and PGs in Delhi-NCR, storage space has become a means to sustain him during these times. This landlord says, “Jo log Maharashtra, UP se hain woh iss time Gurugram aana safe nahin samajh rahe... People who were living on rent in Delhi-NCR have reached out to me from across the country including Mumbai, UP, and even south India. We sent a vendor to get their luggage picked up, and then confirmed with the owner each item on the check list. After all this checking, we sent a video to the owner on WhatsApp to confirm.”Aditya Kaushal, a 32-year-old fraud investigator with an MNC in Gurugram, tells us, “I was travelling prior and have been with my family in Jammu since March, and couldn’t go back to Gurugram because of lockdown. There is a huge rent burden wherein I’m not using the premises but still have to pay the rent. My stuff was lying in the house (refrigerator, washing machine, etc.). Initially we had a discussion with the owner about the salary cuts that I had to bear, but the owners didn’t agree to reduce the rent. The only option thus left was to find a storage facility and move our stuff over there. I took help of movers and packers, and a friend helped me too. And now when the landlord saw us vacating it, he thought he’d loose a steady income so offered to reduce the rent by 40% till the time we come back!”Those who are renting out their place for storage are ensuring to share all crucial information in advance, before allocating the space. Kovid Ummat, an advertising professional who is renting his two rooms as storage space, says security is a concern, too. “We ensure that I and the other party share all details prior. Somewhere this came out of our own need, as one of my flatmate had left for Agra before the lockdown. And when we came home, we realised that it was uncertain as to when will WFH stop. The rent was a completely avoidable expenditure at this point. So we guys thought to take out our stuff and put it in a warehouse, and in the process realised that they aren’t many warehouses. This made us open two rooms for people who required this facility. It’s an equal opportunity for all. There are people like us who don’t want to spend anything like ₹30,000 as monthly rent when they aren’t even living in these places.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/unlock-tales-with-50-rent-storage-spaces-are-a-win-win-for-both-tenants-and-landlords/story-rTpf3zyByIDfZzwt5QVmcL.html

25-06-2020||Pune||KYC expiration pretext used in multiple cases of online fraud||A text message with a pretext of KYC expiration for a popular e-wallet was sent to multiple victims of online fraud in Bibvewadi, Pune. A 61-year-old man was duped of Rs 1,11,138 after he called a phone number mentioned in an SMS he received on his mobile phone on April 17, according to police. He lost money from three different bank accounts.In a similar incident, another person was duped of Rs 1,96,393 after he called the number mentioned in an SMS he received on April 17.In yet another case registered on Sunday, a 55-year-old man lost Rs 43,998 through multiple transactions.All complainants in the case are above 55 years of age.The SMS warned the complainants of expiration of know-your-customer (KYC) sections of their e-wallet. The SMS provided them with a phone number on which they could call to extend their KYC.Once the complainants called the number, the callers tricked them into making a transaction of Rs 1 and told the complainants that the transactions failed due to expired KYC.To update the KYC, they were asked to download an application called Quick Support App onto their mobile phones. The application provided access to the bank details of the complainants’ links with the e-wallet. Without sharing any more details of the case, police inspector crime Muralidhar Khokale of Bibvewadi police station said that the police station has received more such complaints.The trend of using the false pretext of the e-wallet’s KYC expiration to commit online fraud started around a year ago, according to police inspector Jayram Paygude of the cyber police station.“People share confidential information, OTPs and download whatever the caller asks them to without verifying. That is a problem,” said PI Paygude.The cases have come on the radar of the city police’s cybercrime cell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kyc-expiration-pretext-used-in-multiple-cases-of-online-fraud/story-7XVGjpucS2tXiN2nf2kBNI.html
25-06-2020||Bangalore||Complete shutdown in parts of Bengaluru to fight Covid-19: BS Yediyurappa||The Karnataka government on Monday decided to enforce complete and full lockdown in four major areas of the state capital, following a sharp rise in the coronavirus cases.At a cabinet meeting called today to take stock of the situation, Yediyurappa decided to enforce complete shutdown in KR Market, Chamarajapete, Kalasipalya and Chickpete.Briefing reporters after the review meeting, minister for revenue and municipal administration R Ashoka said that some of the quarantined are leaving their phones behind and roaming around, thus evading strict government regulations. He warned that police would register a criminal case against those breaking quarantine rules. The government has also promised to notify tariff rates for treatment in private hospitals shortly.In the recent past, the government has been an active votary for opening up the state for more activities. The same willingness to open the economy was conveyed by chief minister BS Yediyurappa in the chief ministers’ video conference with PM Modi.The development follows after the state saw its biggest single-day jump in Covid-19 cases with 453 new virus cases being registered on Sunday. Out of them 196 were from Bengaluru.On Monday, the state capital at 126 new cases accounted for half of the Covid-19 cases registered today - 249. Bengaluru (urban and rural) with 958 cases account for nearly a third of all active cases in the state.Incidentally unlike in the past where spikes were due to an influx of people coming back from different states, contact history of the new patients indicates that it has been locally transmitted.Till date Karnataka has reported 9,399 Covid-19 positive cases with 152 deaths and 3,523 active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bengaluru/complete-shutdown-in-parts-of-bengaluru-to-fight-covid-19-bs-yediyurappa/story-l49pM1UAbdJHagmo2BIMtJ.html
