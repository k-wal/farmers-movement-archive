No arrest has been made in the case yet. The victim has been identified as Anil Kumar, who lived in Patli village of Farrukhnagar. According to the police, the incident took place around 8.45pm, when the Kumar and the friend, Amardeep Sethi, were consuming liquor at the latter’s plot in Patli. They were approached by a man, who asked Sethi for a bottle of country-made liquor and returned after being informed that Sethi was no longer in the business of selling liquor. However, getting suspicious of the man’s behaviour, Sethi followed him, a police official said.“He saw at least three persons in an SUV, who were armed, and ran to a secluded spot. The accused persons then entered the plot and fired indiscriminately at the victim,” the police official said.In the police complaint, Sethi named one Vikas as a suspect. “I had introduced Vikas to a friend and both had an agreement regarding distribution of liquor during the lockdown. One of Vikas’ cars, carrying a consignment of liquor, was caught by the police in Jhajjar and since then, he had been insisting that I pay ₹60,000 for the loss. I had told him that I had no role in it. Since then, there had been enmity and he had threatened me. The accused had come to attack me and I managed to escape,” he said in the FIR.The police said that Kumar was rushed to a private hospital, where he was declared dead, adding that he suffered at least six gunshot wounds. The assailants fired at least 10 gunshots, some of which hit a wall, the police said. A case has been registered against the accused under sections 302 (murder) and 34 (acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) of the Indian Penal Code and section 25/54/59 of the Arms Act at Farrukhnagar police station, said police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/man-shot-dead-by-attackers-who-had-come-to-kill-an-acquaintance/story-YLRRxlHl71NJGH5oxmxhKL.html
10-06-2020||Chandigarh||From 33 to 118 in two weeks: Surge in Covid cases worries Karnal admn||A sudden spurt in the number of coronavirus cases has become a cause of worry for the Karnal administration. The district saw its tally rising from 33 to 118 in merely two weeks, besides registering a death. Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav on Wednesday convened a meeting of all stakeholders, including nodal officers and senior doctors of Karnal medical college. Directions were issued to contain the virus spread in the district, especially in Karnal city. As per the health officials, the cases increased soon after the government relaxed the curbs on movement post-June 1. District administration faced tough time in detecting infection as people having travel history to other states often showed reluctance in disclosing their details, officials said.The administration has now issued directions and made it mandatory for the people coming from other states to disclose their travel history, or face criminal cases.Karnal DC said, “Cases increased after we started random sampling. We are testing around 250 people daily.”“Since most of the patients have a history of travel to other states, the administration is encouraging people to disclose their details and get themselves tested if they develop any symptom,” he added.About the preparations, especially in the hospitals, to deal with the situation if cases continue to rise, the DC said, “There is no shortage of beds as of now. Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College has 450 beds and the administration has also identified Covid care centres with 500 bed capacity where asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients can be kept.” As per the data, 10,224 people, including 1,125 foreign-returnees, have been examined for Covid-19 in Karnal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/from-33-to-118-in-two-weeks-surge-in-covid-cases-worries-karnal-admn/story-w80hvReSdKCopyfZNAsVEO.html
10-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Residents of The Palms form team, take onus of contact tracing||Residents of The Palms condominium in South City 1 have come together and formed a seven-member team to carry out contract tracing of people testing positive for the virus in their society on their own.Residents say they were forced to resort to this measure after concerned officials failed to turn up to carry out contact tracing exercise after a resident tested positive for Covid-19 on June 6.“Last week, the first Covid-19 case in the condominium was detected. We subsequently informed authorities to take charge and start the contact tracing process. However, after no official from any of the concerned departments turned up for two days, perhaps due to the high load of Covid-19 cases, we started getting worried. We realised that some residents could have come in contact with the person and, hence, it was vital to start contact-tracing on an immediate basis,” said Brigadier (retired) Brijendra Singh, a member of Palms Apartment Owners Association (PAOA).Singh said that one resident — Minakshi Tewari, who had last month undertaken a five-hour online contact tracing course from John Hopkins University — volunteered to help carry out the task.“As time was running out, we decided to hand over the contact tracing responsibility to Tewari and put in place pre-emptive measures. She was soon able to identify those who came in contact with the Covid-19 patient and advised them to take necessary safety steps like quarantining themselves and disinfecting their premises. Just a day later, a second case was detected in the condominium, in another tower. But this time we were able to start contact tracing right away and saved crucial time in cautioning those who interacted with the person,” said Singh.Singh said that in the first Covid-19 case in the condominium, officials from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) turned up for sanitising and disinfecting purposes three days after the issue was reported. For the second case, no official from any public body has so far turned up at the premises.Singh also gave the example of a domestic help who was identified during the contact tracing process and had returned to her native place in West Bengal, but was unwilling to self-quarantine. He said that the local administration in Dinajpur district, West Bengal, was informed about this development and they subsequently took necessary action.Contacted, Tewari said that her daughter — who is studying infectious disease epidemiology at John Hopkins University at Baltimore, Maryland in the United States of America (USA) — told her last month to enrol for the five-hour course as a precautionary measure.“My daughter had informed me about this course and I opted for it out of sheer curiosity. When authorities failed to turn up for the second day after the first Covid case was detected, I decided to volunteer for contact tracing. We realised there would be more such cases in the locality and it was important that a team for contact tracing is formed to limit the spread of the virus,” said Tewari. Tewari said that so far six other residents have volunteered and completed the five-hour-long online course, and a team of seven members under the ‘crisis management team’ has been formed to look after the contact tracing process for future cases, if they occur in the condominium.On June 4, divisional commissioner Ashok Sangwan directed HSVP to coordinate contact tracing of Covid-19 patients. Prior to this, the district health department used to carry out this task.Bharat Bhushan Gogia, estate officer, HSVP declined to comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-residents-of-the-palms-form-team-take-onus-of-contact-tracing/story-O70R5Hig5eAeSF3ck8jJWJ.html

Calling the home minister, who also holds health portfolio, the “most honest” person who is “perfect” for the CM’s post, the MLA said, “Yes, I will join the BJP. I had withdrawn my support from corruption and a corruption-supporter CM, not the BJP.” Interacting with mediapersons at the residence of a local leader in Yamunanagar, he said, “Vij is the most honest person in this government and he wants to work with honesty. But he is not being allowed to do so. Every file sent by him is bounced back by the chief minister’s office. His every action is reversed by the CM.” “He (Vij) is made to work like a laachar (helpless) and those who claim honesty have put up a network of corruption that has made the condition worse in the state,” Kundu said. He also spoke about the popularity of Manohar Lal Khattar, the de-notification of Dadupur-Nalvi canal and the recent controversy involving Sonali Phogat. Balraj Kundu had withdrawn his support from the BJP-JJP government in February alleging corruption in the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/will-join-bjp-if-vij-becomes-cm-meham-mla-kundu/story-uJ9ST3rMtTfvuS7YB27afP.html
10-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram deputy commissioner tells officials to crack down on people without masks||The deputy commissioner of Gurugram on Wednesday asked officials to crack down on people who continue to not wear masks in public and penalise them ₹500, as per the provisions of the Haryana government.The directions were issued in view of a rapid increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the district, with the total reaching 2,546 cases on Wednesday. Over the last week, over 100 cases are being reported daily in the city every day.Amit Khatri, the deputy commissioner (DC), said that officials designated to conduct checks should collect challan books from the civil surgeon of Gurugram and ensure that violators are penalised.The Haryana government has allowed administrations to impose a fine of ₹500 on those not wearing a mask or spitting in a public place, in view of the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. The penalties obtained from the violators should be deposited in government treasury under the head of ‘0210-01-800-92 other items’.Khatri said that wearing masks in public places is mandatory due to the coronavirus pandemic. “The mask can be made of cloth or it may be bought from the market, but it is necessary for the residents to wear it while on streets, roads or other public places,” he said, adding that violators must be asked to pay the penalty, failing which the police must take action under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.Officials, who have been authorised to enforce the directions, are sub-divisional magistrates in respective areas, ACPs, tehsildars, nayab tehsildars, block development officers, executive engineers of MCG, Zila Parishad, SHOs, civil surgeons, health officers and other officials designated by the deputy commissioner.Earlier this week, Gurugram police commissioner had also asked all SHOs to regularly monitor CCTV camera footage in their areas to spot people not wearing a mask so that they can be tracked real-time and booked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-deputy-commissioner-tells-officials-to-crack-down-on-people-without-masks/story-KXpW42yaF9l1WXiCwNmpzH.html
10-06-2020||Gurugram||IMFL likely to get cheaper in Gurugram from Thursday, beer to remain expensive||Liquor vendors in the city are likely to reduce the price of Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) from Thursday after the Delhi excise department withdrew its 70% ‘special corona fee’ levied on the Maximum Retail Price (MRP).Liquor vend owners said they will have to reduce prices for IMFL, failing which people may start buying liquor from Delhi and subsequently, affecting their businesses.The prices for liquor increased by up to 40% across the district on May 6, when the liquor vends reopened. Since Haryana does not have MRP on liquor bottles, shopkeepers were selling liquor for higher prices than usual.Shop owners said IMFL will get cheaper but beer will remain expensive, as the price had been increased by almost 40% due to multiple factors. “The city cannot compete with the beer prices in Delhi with the current excise duty and policy,” said Deepak Kumar, who is managing a liquor vend at Sector 51 said. He said that price of high-end whiskeys will reduce from ₹3,400-₹4,000 to around ₹2,500, while bottles costing ₹1,000 would now be sold for ₹800. HC Dahiya, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (west), said that due to the competition with the neighbouring national capital, liquor vendors are likely to reduce the liquor price. “The prices have to be competitive. Else, the state will suffer huge revenue losses,” he saidThe excise department charges a Covid cess of ₹10-₹30 on each bottle. The minimum retail sale price is inclusive of this cess. The shopkeepers, however, increased the prices to make a quick buck.The Haryana government on March 26 had decided to temporarily shut liquor vends across the state as part of its preventive measures to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/imfl-likely-to-get-cheaper-in-gurugram-from-thursday-beer-to-remain-expensive/story-C1egwqLsVU3AOtE3Rm503N.html
10-06-2020||City||Noida: Teen girl goes missing, family alleges police inaction||Noida: The family of a 14-year-old girl, who went missing from her house located under the Phase 2 police jurisdiction on June 8, has alleged that the Noida police have not taken any action in the case and have not filed an FIR.The incident had come to light Monday afternoon. In his complaint to the police, the father of the girl stated that he was asleep at the time of the incident while his wife had gone out for buying groceries.“When she came back around 3pm, she woke me up as our daughter was nowhere to be found. Instead, we found a phone in our house that didn’t belong to any of us. When we checked the number, it seemed to belong to someone from Himachal Pradesh,” said the father.The family lives in a rented accommodation. The father said on the floor above theirs, construction work was going on. The family members suspect that at least two of the construction workers might be involved in the disappearance of their daughter as two of them haven’t been back to work since and may have taken the girl, who is a 7th standard student of a private school, with them. The father said that the workers would sometimes come to their house to drink water.“The family has been running from pillar to post but no action has been taken against their complaint. Even the law says that a case has to be registered after 24 hours. They are scared that their daughter will come to harm because of delay in police action. They also have a suspect’s phone with them. If cops want, they can easily trace the girl and whoever has taken her,” said Vishal Gautam, the family’s lawyer.He said that if the police continue with their lax attitude, the family will directly approach the court for a magisterial inquiry.The matter was, however, later brought to the notice of senior police officials.“We will speak to the family and ensure that necessary action is taken soon,” said deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2, Harish Chander.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-teen-girl-goes-missing-family-alleges-police-inaction/story-JmRFIHoGphoLtqHxm4rvkI.html
10-06-2020||Gurugram||Excise dept waives off liquor licence fee for first quarter||The excise and taxation department has decided to waive off liquor licence fee for restaurants and bars operating in the district for the current quarter, officials said on Wednesday. The restaurants and bars have been shut since March 25, when a lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19 was first imposed. Although restaurants can reopen now with 50% capacity, bars remain shut.Anurag Rastogi, principal secretary, excise and taxation, said, “We have decided to waive off the licence fee for a quarter as these establishments were closed and have suffered huge losses,” he said.The Gurugram Restaurants’ Association had sought financial relief from the excise department last month. They had submitted applications for waiver of fee for running bars for at least six months and sought permission to exchange expired beer without the imposition of any fee or goods and services tax (GST).Inderjeet Banga, the owner of Prankster and Pirates of Grill and the head of the Gurugram chapter of the National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI), welcomed the decision. “We had demanded that the government should waive off liquor licence fee for the lockdown period and allow us to pay the licence fees monthly, instead of annually,” he said.The department is yet to take a decision on a monthly licence fee structure, said officials.The liquor license fee for a five-star hotel in the district is ₹25 lakh per annum, while it is ₹18 lakh per annum for bars and restaurants, and ₹10 lakh for microbreweries. It has to be paid in April, but the process was suspended due to the lockdown.Pushpendra Yadav, director, Quaff microbrewery, said that the move would provide some relief to the sector as they have suffered huge losses and many establishments would have been forced to shut, subsequently leading to large-scale unemployment, if relief was not provided. “We are relaxed after hearing the decision but still we have to prepare for the setups once the operations are restarted and we will have to follow all the guidelines to ensure social distancing. It will take time for our businesses to normalise,” he said.Most restaurants in the city have not resumed the dine-in facility till now, fearing low footfall and increased losses. Some restaurants and bars in the district have already closed permanently due to the ongoing crisis, association members said.Lalit Ahlawat, director of Soi Hospitality in CyberHub, said that they should be granted six months leeway to pay licence fees when the operations are in full swing. “The hospitality sector is already facing a catastrophic situation with revenues plunging drastically amid the Covid-19 outbreak. One quarter would not be enough and the department should waive off the licence fee for at least six months. The situation has been compounded due to the recent lockdown measures. To revive the economic situation, the government will have to support this industry as we have been one of the revenue-generating sectors,” he said.Restaurant owners also said they will have to pay their staff in advance to call them back from their home state and the waiver should be extended for another quarter in such circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/excise-dept-waives-off-liquor-licence-fee-for-first-quarter/story-sU1Z2rV5ssobEZrvQiw5kL.html
10-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: Over 10% Covid-19 patients going untraced due to incomplete contact details||More than 10% of Covid-19 cases confirmed by private labs in the city are going untraced due to incorrect contact details provided by people, causing an impact on surveillance and contact tracing, officials said on Wednesday.The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), which was earlier this week given the task to liaison with the private and government labs for Covid-19 test reports, has been facing trouble due to inadequate contact details of the suspected cases tested in private labs. According to the officials, there are 10 teams to trace such people and assistance from the local police is also being taken. “Every day, we have at least 10-12% of such Covid-19 positive reports where initial details for verification are missing. The address is incomplete, there are incorrect phone numbers or somebody getting tested in Gurugram shares his/her domicile address given in the ID card. It becomes difficult for the team to trace such people and their high-risk contacts, who can potentially transmit the virus to others,” said Jaspreet Kaur, additional commissioner, MCG, who is also designated as officer for management of Covid-19 test reports.According to her, 10 teams, comprising two members each, have been deployed to reach out to those people who have given correct mobile numbers but incomplete addresses. “Our teams coordinate with the primary health centres (PHCs) and the local police to trace such people in two to three days,” said Kaur.The MCG additional commissioner said that in many cases, neither the physicians prescribing tests nor the private hospitals and labs involved in taking samples are taking complete address or contact details of the suspected patients. “These crucial details are missing on the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) portal where labs have to upload the test results,” she said.A meeting was held with the lab representatives on Tuesday to discuss the matter, said Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer. “The issue of incomplete contact details of patients was raised in the meeting with the labs functional in Gurugram,” he said.Currently, six private labs and three government labs in Rohtak, Sonepat and Nalhar are taking samples from Gurugram.HT tried reaching out to two private laboratories for comment, but they did not respond. the others could not be reached. Residents are even giving their samples at private labs of Delhi, accredited by the ICMR. An ICMR study in April predicted that a Covid-19 patient can infect 406 people in 30 days if preventive measures such as social distancing are not implemented.Since Gurugram in the past 10 days has seen a record surge in the coronavirus cases, Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner, assigned different government departments for the management of Covid-19 situation in the city. MCG is designated to handle test reports. Once the reports are uploaded by the labs on the ICMR portal, teams deployed at the MCG segregate reports based on the four zones of the city. The list of the positive patient is shared with the nodal medical officer of that particular zone, who further coordinate with the PHC team (PHC) to home visit or make a telephonic call to the person infected with Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19.Earlier this week, Haryana home minister Anil Vij had written a letter to the Union health minister, Dr Harsh Vardhan, mentioning that labs in Delhi, which are taking Covid-19 samples of Haryana residents, are not sharing reports properly with the authorities concerned, resulting in delay of contact tracing and surveillance activities, besides creating mismatch on ICMR portal and state portal. On May 31, the Director General Health Services (DGHS) Haryana issued notices to 18 private labs of Delhi, approved by ICMR for doing Covid-19 testing in the national capital, for taking samples of Haryana patients without keeping Haryana health department in the loop.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-over-10-covid-19-patients-going-untraced-due-to-incomplete-contact-details/story-ibTDVJDiDpmjFUC8EVtJ8L.html
10-06-2020||City||Govt may have to shut local health centres to arrange staff for Covid hospitals||To deal with rising Covid-19 cases in the district, the Ghaziabad health department has decided to open a 200-bed L1 category Covid hospital (for non-critical positive cases) for which they will need to rope in medical teams from the health centres at Muradnagar, Modingar and Bhojpur areas. The officials said in the future, if more Covid-dedicated facilities are opened, then they will have to shut down the urban health centres as well in order to find medical personnel to man the new hospitals.Under the three-tier dedicated health care facilities to deal with Covid-19 cases, the Uttar Pradesh government has identified different health centres under L1, L2 and L3 levels with L1 catering to non-critical Covid-19 patients, while L2 and L3 will deal with more complicated and critical cases. The 200-bed facility is proposed to be opened at Divyjtoti College in Niwari and will cater to L1 category patients (non-critical). Currently, the health department has a 76-bed L1 ESI Hospital and a 60-bed L1 facility at Mariam Hospital in Nandgram.“Divyajyoti hospital will become operational in another one or two days and we will deploy teams from the community health centres (CHCs) at Muradnagar, Modinagar besides a team from the primary health (PHC) centre in Bhojpur. This diversion of staff will pose issues with regard to the treatment of non-Covid patients at the CHCs and PHC. The staff members of CHC Dasna are presently deployed to look after the operations at Mariam Hospital,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said.The health department has proposed a total of about 4,000 Covid beds in the district, on the directions of the state government. The officials said each team deployed at a L1 hospital will have 25 members, while a team deployed at a L2 hospital will have 53 members.“If we open other Covid facilities and draw staff from our urban health centres or dispensaries. This will again affect non-Covid patient care at dispensaries. Both L1 hospitals that are presently operational are almost full,” the CMO said.In all, officials said that they can cater to about 900 to 1,000 Covid patients with the available staff, but at the cost of treatment given to non-Covid patients at CHCs and PHCs.Apart from the government Covid facilties, officials said they have also given an authorisation to two private hospitals, one in Vaishali and the other in Vasundhara, to operate as paid Covid facilities.The Ghaziabad district, till June 10, has recorded a total of 541 Covid-19 cases with 342 persons being discharged from different hospitals after treatment. The number of active cases is 182, and the death toll 17. Of the 14 patients found positive on Wednesday, three cases are from Loni while one each was reported from Vasundhara, Indirapuram and Khoda besides other cases in different areas.The officials are also worried about increase in number of cases related to severe acute respiratory infections (SARI). The officials said to deal with SARI cases, which can also prove fatal when manifested with Covid-19, they have come up with a 30-bed ward at MMG Hospital for SARI cases. The CMO said SARI cases have increased from 5% at the end of May to 10% this week, which is cause for concern.“Since the cases of SARI are on the rise, we have come up with a special ward at the MMG hospital to treat such patients. The patients will be the ones who are identified during surveillance in different areas or even those who come for availing of treatment at government hospitals,” Dr Anurag Bhargava, chief medical superintendent of MMG Hospital, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/govt-may-have-to-shut-local-health-centres-to-arrange-staff-for-covid-hospitals/story-mNxQ6DE2acUgG6ImZMVa1I.html

The khap members said if their demands weren’t met, they would launch an agitation on June 12. The meeting, chaired by khap president Nafe Singh Nain, passed a resolution condemning the incident and described it as an insult of ‘Khap’s son’, Sultan Singh, who hails from Saccha Khera village of Jind district, where this khap wields influence.“We will give a memorandum to Hisar superintendent of police Ganga Ram Punia and deputy commissioner Priyanka Soni on June 12 to arrest Phogat. If our demands are not met, we will go on a protest,” he added.UNDER PRESSURE TO STRIKE COMPROMISE: SECY Hisar market committee secretary Sultan Singh, who was also present in the meeting, claimed that many people were mounting pressure on him to strike a compromise with Phogat. “Her supporters had also thrashed me. I will accept whatever decision the Khap body makes in this issue,” he added.WOMEN PROTEST IN HISARMeanwhile, a group of women held a protest in Hisar and sought arrest of Sultan Singh. They said Singh had used indecent language to address Sonali Phogat and other women politicians of Haryana. “Sonali had to thrash Sultan Singh as he used derogatory remarks against her. A woman cannot tolerate such a slur on her from anyone,” said one of the protesters. The police should arrest him, otherwise we will start an agitation in Hisar, the women said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-khap-warns-of-stir-if-sonali-phogat-not-arrested/story-QqJMFKlDotyJ7fQn7IyRpN.html
10-06-2020||City||Resident’s body demands waiver of home loan interest for lockdown period||For providing relief to homebuyers, Noida Estates Flat Owners Main Association (NEFOMA) has suggested waiver of interest amount during the moratorium period on EMIs payable to banks and other financial institutions .“In the Covid-19 crisis, people are experiencing salary cuts or losing jobs, hence they are not in a position to give regular EMIs with hefty interest. Association has written to prime minister demanding waiver of interest for the lockdown period,” Anu Khan, president, NEFOMA, said on Wednesday. “The association has also sought amendment in section 24(b) of the Income Tax Act, 1961, removing the 5 years limitation in claiming deductions on interest on home loans.”“Presently RBI’s repo rate is 4 percent however banks charge 7.35 to 9.25 percent on home loans, which means spread charge is 3.35 to 5.25 percentage points, and processing fee extra,” said Khan. “Apart from that banks pays depositors between 2.75 to 4 percent as interest on seven days to 3 years in fixed deposit. In 2019, there is a sharp reduction in FD returns to depositors. But there is no reduction to the lending rates both on the retail side and as well as in construction line.”One of the Gaursons Realtak project allottee Jagbir Singh Bisht said, “Banks were earlier directed not to demand instalments for three months. But I deposited the EMIs because on delayed payment I have to pay interest even on three months interest. The waiver demand is justified and will provide much needed relief to us.”Rajinder Sharma allottee of Supertech project echoed similar views and said, “The central government should take decision of waiver to provide relief to us.”However Pankaj Gupta allottee of ATS Allure has different viewpoint and said, “Waiver demand is not justified. If banks are forced to waive the interest then banks will demand that banks should be allowed not to pay interest during lockdown period to FD and other depositors. “Gupta said, “Best practical solution is that allottees should get the three months interest added to their loan. This will increase one or two instalments. This will help in overcoming the present financial crisis of allottees.”Gautam Budh Nagar lead district bank manager Ved Ratna said, “Waiver is not practical approach.” He said RBI has already refused this demand. Some persons had moved Supreme Court and now the matter lies with the Union government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/resident-s-body-demands-waiver-of-home-loan-interest-for-lockdown-period/story-m5zCcxiYIyIVEvhKphp0TI.html
10-06-2020||City||No let-up in cases, Khoda to remain a containment zone||For a month now, residents of Khoda locality in Ghaziabad have been confined to their homes in light of the surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases from the locality, turning it into a containment zone. District officials say they are unlikely to lift these restrictions as cases are still being reported from there. Officials estimate that about 285,000 people are living in the congested slum colony, most of them engaged in factories and other small time jobs in the three surrounding cities of Ghaziabad, Noida and Delhi. Khoda was sealed on May 10 and placed under the “sector scheme” -- 50 of the 52 routes in and out of the locality were sealed to all except essential services personnel. At the time, the area had 14 Covid-19 cases, which rose to 64 on June 9. Three deaths due to the virus have been reported so far.Through the month of June, residents have been complaining that the sealing was adversely impacting their daily lives.“It is time that Khoda is unsealed and only those areas from where cases are emerging should be sealed and converted to containment zones. We forced to sit idle at home and face the risk of losing jobs. Traders, too, are sitting idle as only essential supply shops are allowed to open from 7am to noon,” Rajendra Singh, councillor from Shiv Vihar, said.Traders have demanded for that be allowed to open shop as they are suffering huge losses.“Markets have been closed for nearly three months since the lockdown was imposed on March 25. It is getting difficult to pay the rents. People are forced to take loans from friends and relatives to survive. A majority of residents who are not employed in offices or factories have shops in Khoda. At present, they are surviving with great difficulty,” Yogesh Bhati, a trader from Mangal Bazar, said. Social activists said it is not proper to place such a large population under sealing for a long time.“Covid-19 cases will continue to rise further. For Khoda, it would be better to create containment zones rather than putting the entire population under lockdown. Apart from other arrangements for essential supplies, administration should also arrange for dedicated helplines for Khoda residents for redressal of their grievances,” Sandhya Gautam, a Noida resident and coordinator, National Alliance for Maternal Health and Human Rights, said. “Unlike high-rises, whose residents’ voices are always heard by authorities, demands from poor people like us fall on deaf ears. The administration should look into our issues and address them,” she said. Khoda’s nagar palika executive officer KK Bhadana said he has sent some suggestions for relaxation in sealing but a final call rests with the district magistrate.“We have suggested that markets be allowed to open on alternate days and some more entry/exit points be opened. The district magistrate has to decide. At present, we have four major areas -- Rajiv Vihar, Indira Garden, Azad Vihar and Hayat Nagar -- from where most number of Covid-19 cases have been reported,” he said.Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO), Ghaziabad, said it would not be appropriate to lift the sealing in Khoda completely.“Cases are still rising. Some relaxations could be made in internal localities but we will not recommend a complete de-sealing . Otherwise, there is a risk that cases will rise, especially given the large size of the population. We are primarily focussed on containment. Our teams are taking up surveillance and sampling exercises as well as sanitisation measures,” he added.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said, “We will review the situation in Khoda soon and decision on likely relaxations can be expected in the next two or three days.”Similar to Khoda, localities such as Loni and Vaishali have also been sealed since May 27 and June 1, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/no-let-up-in-cases-khoda-to-remain-a-containment-zone/story-IAMBkh4B1xM2u1kQQrxh8N.html

Punia has been transferred to Nuh health department, in the same capacity. Punia was replaced by Dr Virender Yadav, civil surgeon, who was serving as the chief medical officer of Nuh. HT on Monday had reported that senior state officials had decided to transfer Punia following the rapid surge in coronavirus cases and deaths reported in the city.The state health department on Wednesday issued an order stating that the governor of Haryana has made the transfer with immediate effect. Punia took charge as civil surgeon, also called as chief medical officer, of Gurugram health department in July 2019. He was transferred from Sonepat and he replaced Dr BK Rajora in Gurugram. Punia along with his team of seven doctors was handling the Covid-19 crisis since February. The number of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram saw a sudden spike last month and touched 1,000 cases on June 2 and doubled in the next six days.“In Gurugram, the focus will be on testing and cutting the chain of transmission. The time gap between sample collection and test reports has to be brought down to 24-36 hours and quarantine measures has to be strengthened,” said Yadav, who will be joining the Gurugram office from Thursday evening. Yadav has served in Faridabad, Charkhi Dadri and Karnal, before taking charge of Nuh health department on February 1 this year. Nuh was one of the worst-affected Covid-19 district after the Tablighi Jamaat incident was reported in April. More than 200 people with links to Markaz were traced in Nuh. Currently, the district has 56 active cases, out of the 111 total Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/as-cases-deaths-surge-gurugram-medical-chief-transferred-to-nuh/story-B0ynbrCUddciOt8GdfLuUO.html
10-06-2020||Noida||Bring migrant workers back: Noida’s garment units tell UP govt||More than a month after the garment manufacturers in Noida were allowed by the state government to resume operations (during the third phase of the nationwide lockdown) city apparel units are still struggling to get back on their feet. According to industry owners, these units are facing acute workforce shortage caused by a mass exodus of migrant workers to their home towns during the lockdown.If garment exporters in the region are to be believed, the workforce shortage will not only hit their productivity but will also lead to major losses in their annual turnovers. Keeping such concerns in mind, the Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC) in a letter to the principal secretary (MSME and export promotion) on Thursday requested the state government to arrange an adequate workforce and said the Noida garment industry needs over two lakh workers immediately.In response to the letter, Navneet Sehgal, principal secretary (MSME and Export promotion) said a list of over 65,000 workers who will resume work soon has been sent to NAEC on Saturday. He added that the government had reached out to these workers who have agreed to come back and work. “ In a day or two, these workers will report to their respective apparel units,” said Singhal.In its letter, NAEC had said the industry needs tailors and other support staff and the requirement of two lakh workers is likely to be double in the next few months. “Also, another five lakh workforce will be needed for the mega Apparel Park at Sector-29 near Yamuna Expressway, which is likely to come up soon. The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) has already initiated the process of land allotment to the readymade garment investors, to set up nearly 150 apparel units there,” the letter read.Lalit Thukral, president, NAEC, said they had received the list of workers from the principal secretary along with their contact details. He added that despite being the second-highest employment provider (after the agriculture sector) in the state, the garment industry has so far failed to fill the gap between demand and supply. “Most of our workers have gone back to their home towns. When we reach out to them asking them to resume their jobs, most of them say that being with their families at this time of crisis is more important for them rather than making a living miles away, “ he added.He further said the Noida cluster alone hosts nearly 3,000 readymade garment production-cum-export units that employ over 10 lakh workers and export garments worth around ₹20,000 crores annually. “But these units are now unable to resume operations fully because of the shortage of workers. We are facing a severe workforce shortage after many workers returned to their home towns,” he said.Manoj Sahu, who runs a garment export company in Noida, said without state government’s intervention in bringing the workers back, resume complete operations is almost impossible for apparel manufacturers in the district. “Most of the workers at garment factories have returned to their home towns. When we ask them to resume their jobs they refuse our offers and prefer to be with their families. We have been allowed to operate with the full workforce now, but only two lakh workers have started working in garment factories so far,” he said.Another garment exporter Roshan Baid said the workers’ unwillingness to work in city-based industries will lead to major setbacks to all apparel exporting units. “After almost zero production in April, the exodus of workers can reduce our production by as much as 50%. Some workers are so adamant about not coming back that they have now started refusing our offers of higher wages as well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/bring-migrant-workers-back-noida-s-garment-units-tell-up-govt/story-gE3NbnXZYkWsUxbUm1LJNP.html

Aside from this, a discussion was also held on preparing a mechanism to regulate and monitor the deployment of super sucker machines,” said Azad.Singh was scheduled to attend the meeting on Wednesday but could not make it as he had to attend a state-level meeting instead, said MCG officials. Hence, another meeting has been scheduled with the MCG commissioner, councillors and engineering wing officials on Friday to take stock on monsoon preparedness.Due to Singh’s absence, a thorough review of MCG’s status in regard to monsoon preparedness was deferred to Friday while decisions on cancelling contracts of few tenders that may have been allocated with discrepancies was also pushed forward by two days, said an official who attended the meeting.The meetings are taking place after nine councillors of the MCG alleged that the civic body is under-prepared for the upcoming monsoon season and that there are various discrepancies with the existing measures taken in regard to the cleaning of drains. They alleged that if the situation does not improve, then the city may witness a similar scenario as the July 2016 deluge, popularly referred to as Gurujam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-municipality-to-hold-meet-take-stock-of-monsoon-preparedness/story-mh51BpGMUN8imuOnqawkmM.html

After the Wadhawans sought bail on the grounds that Arthur Road jail had Covid-19 infected inmates and they had an apprehension of contracting the virus due to their medical condition, the court directed jail authorities to submit details of the measures put in place to protect prisoners from contacting the virus.The bench of justice Bharati Dangre while hearing the bail applications of the father-son duo was informed that as there had been numerous cases of Covid positive inmates and jail staff in Arthur Road and as they had some medical conditions, they apprehended a threat to their lives, hence sought bail. Advocate Amit Desai for the Wadhawans informed the court that if they were granted bail, they would observe self-quarantine and will be available at the given address. However, public prosecutor Prajakta Shinde opposed the applications on behalf of the state and said that sufficient measures were put in place by the prison authorities for the safety of the prisoners, hence the apprehensions of the applicants were unfounded.After hearing the submissions, justice Dangre observed that the Wadhawans were safer in the jail rather than being outside it. She, however, directed the jail authorities to submit details of the precautionary measures put in place for the safety of prisoners after positive cases were reported in the jail. She also asked the authorities to submit a report with details of the barracks in which the Wadhawans were kept and posted the matter for hearing on June 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/pmc-bank-fraud-case-hc-asks-jail-authorities-to-submit-health-details-of-wadhawans/story-wpG98n2ztdWtL3HQVWsZbN.html

The vendors said policemen often chased them away by 2pm and do not allow them to operate from 9am to 9pm, as permitted by the district administration.On June 7, the district magistrate had said that shops will be allowed to open from 9am to 9pm from June 8. Till June 7, grocery shops were allowed to open from 10am to 4pm while fruit/vegetable shops were allowed to open from 10am to 2pm.“The police do not allow us to operate after 2pm and they drive us away. They sometimes make off with the weighing scales to prevent us from carrying on with our business. So when evening comes, and people step out to make purchases, we lose out on the business,” Amit Kumar, a vendor at Kala Patthar, said.The traders’ association members have written to the district magistrate, police officers and the chief minister about the issue.“We sent a letter on June 8 to chief minister Yogi Adityanath, highlighting that small vendors are not being allowed to operate after 2pm. We have also highlighted that markets should be allowed to open on all days, same as liquor shops operating all days from 9am to 9pm. The administration must also consider problems of markets in Vaishali , an area that has been sealed since June 1,” Pradeep Gupta, convener of Vyapari Ekta Samiti , Indirapuram, said.Social activists have also raised the issue and also spoken to police.“The vendors are mostly dependent on directions from the local police. When I observed the closed shopsand required as to the reason, vendors told me that police were troubling them. Vendors in areas of Ahimsa Khand 2, near Aditya Mall road and Kala Patthar are facing this problem,” Alok Kumar, a social activist from Indirapuram, said.Anshu Jain, circle officer of Indirapuram said she will be issuing directions again to the local police stations and police posts. “We are trying our level best to communicate directions to the lower rung officers. I will look into the issue and ask officers to implement the directions of the district administration,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/street-vendors-in-indirapuram-say-cops-force-them-to-shut-by-afternoon/story-azN9dwFudrQE0vwJgcqM4N.html

These medical facilities have been instructed to start operations immediately and failure to do so will attract strict legal action.The notices have been issued under the Maharashtra Essential Services Maintenance Act ( MESMA) 2011.NMMC commissioner Annasaheb Misal said, “Due to the shutting of regular hospitals, several non-Covid patients are facing difficulties in getting treatment. The hospitals and clinics must start functioning immediately. I have hence ordered all hospitals and clinics in NMMC that have shut down, should open immediately, and provide treatment for illnesses other than Covid-19. We have also issued notices to five hospitals in Vashi, Kopar Khairane, Nerul, Airoli, and CBD Belapur.”The commissioner warned that if any hospital is found not providing treatment to patients, strict legal action will be taken against and their registration will be cancelled.Meanwhile, BJP MLA Ganesh Naik has threatened to launch an agitation if corrective measures are not taken to curb the rising Covid-19 cases in Navi Mumbai. He demanded that the NMMC hospital in Vashi, which has been declared a dedicated Covid hospital, be converted back into a regular hospital as the monsoon is about to set in and non-Covid patients are already facing problems.“Since a 1,200-bed Covid facility is coming up at the Cidco Exhibition Centre, the NMMC hospital in Vashi should now treat regular patients,” said Naik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/notice-served-to-5-private-hospitals-in-navi-mumbai/story-ODEFGgVd5xHnVJmve1ajJO.html
10-06-2020||Mumbai||Shift to cash crops, deficit rainfall to blame for agrarian crisis in Marathwada: IIT-B study||A gradual shift towards cash crops at the expense of food crops and deficit rainfall over the years are the primary reasons behind the agrarian crisis in Maharashtra’s drought-hit Marathwada region, according to a study conducted by the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B).Published in the Environmental Research Letters in May, the study analyses the role of rainfall deficits and cropping choices in loss of agricultural yield in Marathwada. The study by a team of research scholars in the civil engineering and climate change departments has found that between 1998 and 2014, the acreage of crop cultivation in Marathwada has skewed rapidly in favour of cash crops. For example, in the Kharif season, the cropped area for the water-guzzling sugarcane crop was almost zero hectares (ha) in 1998. However, since 2002, the acreage of the crop has risen steeply. By 2014, sugarcane occupied almost 1ha cropped area. “The total acreage under the few Rabi crops is about 14% of the main, monsoon-fed Kharif acreage. We observe an increase in acreage under sugarcane, cotton and soybean in the Kharif season, and, wheat and chickpea in the Rabi season with a simultaneous decrease in other crops such as sorghum and pearl millet in the Kharif season, and, sunflower and safflower in the Rabi season,” read the study.Marathwada region is a cluster of eight districts-- Aurangabad, Beed, Hingoli, Jalna, Latur, Nanded, Osmanabad, Parbhani - lies to the east of Maharashtra and records a significant number of farmer suicides. In 2017, a researcher from the University of California, Berkeley, had found that temperature during India’s main agricultural growing season has a strong positive effect on annual suicide rates, particularly at Marathwada.However, the recent study by IIT-B researchers refuted the claim stating that rainfall deficit rather than increasing temperatures had a direct impact on the farmers’ distress in the region. “We aimed to understand and analyse how crops are sensitive to temperature and rainfall. We sought to understand the role of soil moisture and groundwater after the monsoon on the crop yields. What we found is that a shift towards cash crops at the expense of drought-resistant food crops as well as a rainfall deficit can be attributed to the crisis in Marathwada,” said Mariam Zachariah, a research scholar from the department of civil engineering and the co-author of the study. The data used in the study were received from the central government.Based on the study findings, researchers have suggested that encouraging farmers to revert to drought-resistant food crops such as sorghum and pearl-millet, could help ease the burden on farmers. “The agrarian crisis in the region is a much more complex problem with social aspects to it. However, based on our findings, going forward gradually shifting to the food crops is one of the ways the agrarian crisis can be handled, scientifically,” said Zachariah. However, Anand Pole, secretary-general of the Chamber of Marathwada Industries and Agriculture, doesn’t completely agree with the findings of the study. “Along the Godavari, wherever water is available, farmers have moved to cash crops such as sugarcane but that is not true for all farmers. At places where water is not available, farmers are still growing food crops such as jowar, bajra, toor dal among others,” said Pole.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/shift-to-cash-crops-deficit-rainfall-to-blame-for-agrarian-crisis-in-marathwada-iit-b-study/story-p8O4vrrF4W5lR06jRWdagO.html

10-06-2020||Mumbai||After a lull, fresh swarm of locust is back in Nagpur||District agriculture officers are facing a new challenge after a fresh locust swarm hit Nagpur district, intensifying containment efforts from Tuesday night onwards.The Locust Warning Organisation (LWO), under the Union agriculture ministry, said Maharashtra had witnessed a sharp decline in locust swarms between June 3 and 8 owing to a change in wind direction due to Cyclone Nisarga. Though the short-horned grasshoppers were pushed towards Madhya Pradesh (MP), a fresh swarm was spotted moving across six of the seven ranges of Pench Tiger Reserve (PTR) between Monday and Tuesday, and thereafter across villages adjoining forest areas in Ramtek tehsil in Nagpur on Wednesday.“The wind direction over eastern Vidarbha region had changed from northwesterly to southeasterly under the impact of Cyclone Nisarga last week. This pushed the majority of locust swarms either towards west MP or deeper into forest regions adjoining Maharashtra and MP. Combined with this, effective spraying efforts by district officials ensured minimal damage to farms,” said KL Gurjar, deputy director, LWO.Over the past two to three days, though there has been rainfall, the wind direction is favourable for the pests to follow their original trajectory towards farmlands adjoining forests towards Nagpur, said Gurjar. “However, the size of the swarm is small and control efforts have been initiated by local officers. It should not take more than two days to contain their further movement,” he said.Divisional joint director agriculture Ravindra Bhosale said unmanned aerial vehicles (drones) were being used to track the movement of the crop-munching pests while the fire department was spraying three different pesticide solutions — chlorpyriphos, fipronil, and deltamethrin. Pesticide solution of 1,200 ml in 500 litres of water is being used across each one hectare.“We located the swarm in Ramtek tehsil around 11.30 pm Tuesday. After travelling several villages, the swarm had settled in Ajni village, between Ramtek and Mauda tehsil of Nagpur district,” said Bhosale. “We are being assisted by a team of entomologists from Dr. Panjabrao Deshmukh Krishi Vidyapeeth, Akola. There is no damage to food crops, but the pests have been resting on tree species such as anjan (hardwicka), neem, and other fruit trees eating on their leaves. The sound of the drone is also affecting them, making it easier for us to spray pesticides.”PTR forest officers said while crossing over six of seven ranges, leaves of trees such as bamboo, ain (Terminalia elliptica), palash (sacred tree), as well as fruit trees, such as mango and java plum, were affected. “We identified the species as migratory locust (Locusta migratoria). They seem to prefer trees with softer leaves that have less fibre,” said Ravikiran Govekar, field director, PTR. “We have instructed our staff to detail exact records of their movement, changes in bird behaviour, and the number of affected trees.”Gurjar added that as of now the swarm is restricted to Nagpur. During the last week of May, the swarms had split into two affecting four districts in Vidarbha — Amravati, Buldhana, Wardha and Nagpur — affecting an area of 135 hectares across fruit orchards and vegetable farms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/after-a-lull-fresh-swarm-of-locust-is-back-in-nagpur/story-rHxz7CI7kUvaIpBmbsw6CI.html
10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab-origin truck driver held in US for smuggling marijuana from Canada||A 21-year-old Indian national, who used to drive a commercial truck between Canada and the US, has been arrested on the charges of smuggling marijuana with market value of $2,500,000, (Rs 18 crore) a US attorney has said.If convicted, Arshdeep Singh faces a mandatory minimum penalty of five years in prison or a maximum of 40 years and a $5,000,000 fine.According to the complaint, on June 5, a commercial truck carrying coffee makers and bearing Prince Edward Island, Canada license plates, attempted to enter the United States at the Peace Bridge Port of Entry at Niagara Falls in New York, Michael Adler, the assistant US attorney, who is handling the case, said.“The commercial truck was referred to the Vehicle and Cargo Inspection System for a non-intrusive X-ray exam, which showed inconsistencies between the cargo in the nose of the trailer and that of the rest of the load,” the Department of Justice said.Officers also observed that the trailer did not have a commercial seal securing the back doors. “As a result, it was referred to the Peace Bridge warehouse loading dock for a physical exam. During the initial physical exam, officers offloaded the properly identified coffee makers,” the justice department said.They also located four skids containing seven crates that differed from the rest of the load.Inspection of the crates revealed coffee grounds. Secreted under the coffee grounds were vacuum sealed bags containing a green leafy substance, the Department of Justice said. Approximately 1,608 vacuum sealed bundles of suspected marijuana, weighing nearly 1,800 lbs, were removed from the original shipment containers, with an approximate value of USD2,500,000.“Recent events have created unique challenges for our Office and our partners in law enforcement as we work together to keep our communities and our Nation safe and secure,” stated US Attorney James P Kennedy.“While the COVID-19 response may have slowed commerce across our Nation’s borders, this arrest proves not only that criminals persist in their efforts to break the law but that law enforcement remains vigilant in its effort to uphold it,” he added.Port Director Jennifer De La O said: “This was an excellent job by our officers from start to finish”. “From recognising a shipment that needed further screening to the identification of the anomaly during the secondary scan, to the coordination with our partners at HSI, our officers are committed to intercepting these illicit drugs from being smuggled in,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-origin-truck-driver-held-in-us-for-smuggling-marijuana-from-canada/story-G3c9TEnFxtRBOaCnhYYLyN.html
10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana limps back to fiscal normalcy, CM says able to meet routine expenses||The cash-strapped Haryana government is looking to break even after the resumption of large-scale economic activity outside the containment zones in the state. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday said that the financial condition of the state government had started to improve. “We are now in a position to pay for our routine expenses, including salaries, pensions, social security pension, power subsidy,” he added. The state government spends anything between ₹6,200 to ₹7,500 crore every month on payment of salaries, pensions of retired employees, social security pensions, wages to contractual employees, rural electrification and domestic subsidy, and payment of interest and debt. Khattar, who also holds the finance portfolio, however, said the state government was still short on financial resources and would have to raise money from the market to undertake development activity. Till May, the Haryana government was heavily dependent on market borrowings for running its day-to-day affairs. The state government had raised ₹5,000 crore in April and ₹2,000 crore in May from the market to tide over the fiscal crisis. Finance department officials said till June 9, the state government had been able to garner a revenue of ₹2,745 crore. The revenue collection target for June is about ₹6,968 crore. “We expect to get some more money from our share in central taxes and goods and services tax (GST) compensation in June also,” said an official.The state government, which had initially projected a measly ₹1,982 crore revenue target in May, actually earned ₹3,014 crore, thanks to devolution of funds from its share in central taxes and GST compensation. The state government is expecting a disbursement of ₹1,337 crore as GST compensation by the Centre. A cess is levied by the central government for providing compensation to the states for the loss of revenue arising on account of implementation of GST. The compensation cess is a levy collected on supply of select goods and/or services or both, and will remain so till July 2022. “We have earned ₹1,568 crore from GST, including the compensation part, till June 9, about ₹200 crore from excise duty and ₹100 crore from stamps and registration. Our target is to collect another ₹4,200 crore in next three weeks,” said another official.The revenue collection in April was about ₹2,449 crore, while the revenue expenditure was about ₹6,943 crore, statistics reveal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-limps-back-to-fiscal-normalcy-cm-says-able-to-meet-routine-expenses/story-K5IPXlmaQxluTpyMsdxE6J.html

This is a part of its annual pre-monsoon survey conducted by Mhada. A total number of 540 tenants which include 317 residential and 223 commercial tenants have been asked to vacate their premises. These structures are located in places like Girguam, Khetwadi, Nagpada, VP Road and Jacob Circle.According to Vinod Ghosalkar, chairman, Mumbai repair and reconstruction board, Mhada, the residents need to move out immediately. “They should move out immediately before the rains. We might resort to using force to vacate the building. We will not allow them to risk their lives,” said Ghosalkar. He said that Mhada has constructed transit accommodation for them in the Western suburbs of Gorai and Magathane.Of the 18 buildings, seven structures which featured in last year’s list including the infamous Esplanade Mansion, are also repeated this year.However, the residents are unwilling to move out of the premises citing the lack of trust in the housing body. “How can we leave South Mumbai and settle in Gorai and Magathane areas? Our children have schools here and even we have jobs nearby. Mhada should settle us in South Mumbai itself,” said a resident of Nagpada.His fear is not unfounded as thousands of residents who shifted to transit camps are still languishing there for decades. Also, Mhada has not given the timeline on when they can return to their original premises.BOXThis time the number of ‘Extremely dangerous Structures’ has gone down to 18 from 23 last year. The number was 7, 9 and 11 in 2018, 2017 and 2016 respectively.The infamous Esplanade mansion once again features in the list. This is a heritage structure and repairs are not being undertaken as the cost of repairs of such structures is very high compared to normal structures.Mhada has warned that it will use force to drive out residents as the later are living in risky state.The residents contend they will not shift to suburban areas like Gorai and Magathane as it would mean permanently shifting to suburbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mhada-puts-out-list-of-island-city-s-18-dangerous-structures-asks-tenants-to-move-out/story-Pn8bUZ7dKlOSpYCPPVhxoJ.html

The workers had only gathered in an open space near the mosque. But Goswami deliberately highlighted the mosque on his show on April 29 to create communal disturbances in Mumbai,” Shaikh alleged.“The raging debate on Republic TV was aimed at blaming the Muslim community for spreading Covid-19 in Mumbai. Earlier, too, he made similar hate-filled comments, targeting the community,” he further alleged.The FIR was registered under sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, and language), 295A (deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any citizen) 500 (defamation), 505 (2) (spreading rumour or alarming news with intent to create or promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities), and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/police-question-tv-anchor-arnab-goswami-for-5-hours/story-h0mzSbe49q9blwYeQYl16L.html

10-06-2020||Mumbai||We got justice but trial felt like it would kill us, says rape survivor’s mother||Just over a week ago, the Bombay high court upheld a 10-year sentence handed down to a security guard who raped a woman in the building where he worked. The June 2 verdict marked the end of a six-year struggle for the survivor, who was 25 at the time, and her family. Now, her mother says, they can finally start to heal. But first she wanted to describe, in her own words, the ordeal of seeking justice in a rape case.For six years, I have been petrified that he may get away. The case took over our lives. We spend days, weeks, months, in courtroom after courtroom, reduced to initials and numbers. I was PW12 — Prosecution Witness No 12.I would fly in from Singapore, where I live, for the proceedings. When the defence lawyer walked in, it would be time to be violated again and again. I felt helpless and only the presence of sensitive people like special public prosecutor Vaibhav Bagade and police inspector Rajiv Chavan made me feel safe.Truth does not matter at criminal justice trials. At every hearing your dignity is shredded. My daughter had to depose, and so did I and my other daughter, in front of the rapist. When he was not present, his lawyer made up for it. They didn’t have evidence to exonerate this man, so they resorted to lies. I was told it was legally allowed.My daughter’s undergarments, her favourite boots, every injury on her body, was used repeatedly as a tool to demolish her character and suggest that there were reasons, even justifications, for the crime.You want to scream but you are silent.The court is a place where everybody is equal and has to walk through the same doors. But is it an equal justice to have had her morals called into question?Even if the results are eventually just, the proceedings feel like they will kill you. Sensitivity is absent and mindsets and biases that have no place in a court of justice, get free reign.I believe people convicted of rape or murder should get the death penalty. This man will be released after 10 years.When a mother’s worst nightmare comes true, it is irrevocable. Some wounds are here to stay but I may now start to sleep in peace.Because of all the questioning and scrutiny, my daughter has fresh scars to heal from. She is a survivor. She will get through this in time. But we shouldn’t have to be this strong.My daughter deserved respect and compassion, and everywhere we turned, with very few exceptions, she didn’t get it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/my-daughter-has-fresh-scars-to-heal-from-now-says-rape-survivor-s-mother/story-33WzDCjGEouvyFI8AbF11H.html
10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Seven deaths, 370 new infections in Haryana||Haryana registered seven coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, taking the state’s toll to 52. Three patients from Faridabad, two from Gurugram and one each from Sonepat and Charkhi Dadri died. In the last 72 hours, 24 persons have succumbed to the respiratory illness in Haryana. The state reported 370 fresh Covid-19 cases on Wednesday, pushing the tally to 5,579, a bulletin of the health department said. The total number of active cases was 3,339 on Wednesday. National capital region (NCR) districts Gurugram, Faridabad and Sonepat continued to be the biggest contributors to the state’s Covid-19 tally with 286 combined fresh cases, about 77% of the total count.Replying to a query on whether community transmission has set in Gurugram, additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora said 1,700 active cases against a population of three million in the district did not indicate community spread of the disease. “We were able to effectively control the spread of infection till May 17. However, we expected an increase in the number of cases once economic activity and transportation was resumed,” he added. While Gurugram district reported 217 fresh cases, 41 infections were detected in Faridabad and 28 in Sonepat. The active cases in Gurugram were 1,709, more than 50% of the total such cases across 21 districts. Among the other districts, Rohtak reported 23 fresh cases followed by Ambala (13), Jind (11), Charkhi Dadri (10), Fatehabad (6), Kurukshetra and Hisar (5 each), Panchkula, Nuh, Yamunanagar and Rewari (2 each), and Kaithal, Bhiwani and Sirsa (1 each).Karnal, Jhajjar, Panipat, Palwal and Mahendergarh did not report any new case on Wednesday as per the health bulletin. However, Karnal administration said eight people were tested positive for the virus, while one infection was detected in Panipat. TWO PATIENTS DIE IN ROHTAKRohtak civil surgeon Dr Anil Birla said a 66-year-old man suffering from diabetes and another 48-year-old man from Sonepat died at PGIMS here on Wednesday. FROM 33 TO 118 IN TWO WEEKS: SURGE IN CASES WORRIES KARNAL ADMNKarnal A sudden spurt in the number of coronavirus cases has become a cause of worry for the Karnal administration. The district saw its tally rising from 33 to 118 in merely two weeks, besides registering a death.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav on Wednesday convened a meeting of all stakeholders, including nodal officers and senior doctors of Karnal medical college.As per the health officials, the cases increased soon after the government relaxed the curbs on movement post-June 1. District administration faced tough time in detecting infection as people having travel history to other states often showed reluctance in disclosing their details, officials said.The administration has now issued directions and made it mandatory for the people coming from other states to disclose their travel history, or face criminal cases.Karnal DC said, “Cases increased after we started random sampling. We are testing around 250 people daily.”“Since most of the patients have a history of travel to other states, the administration is encouraging people to disclose their details and get themselves tested if they develop any symptom,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/seven-deaths-370-new-infections-in-haryana/story-ISBLgywuD3057401CIGlTI.html
10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown leaves Amritsar’s BRTS project gasping||The coronavirus-induced lockdown has hit the state’s first bus rapid transit system (BRTS) badly. Not only 93 air-conditioned (AC) buses are gathering dust, the exchequer has also been losing around ₹30 lakh per month.The ₹553-crore metro bus service project had already been struggling to draw passengers and the pandemic has cast a gloomy shadow on the project’s future.Around 200 bus drivers have not been paid salaries for the last three months. “The officials say there is no income, so salaries can’t be released. Families of some drivers are on the verge of starvation,” said 50-year-old driver Onkar Singh.“Even if the buses come on the road after some time, there will be fewer passengers. Tourism of the city is already hit. Domestic and international tourists will not come here for at least one year and the project will suffer for a few years,” he said.The officials, however, said the drivers are hired through a private company and are paid per km basis. “Since the buses are not plying, and the company has expressed its inability to pay salaries. But, we are talking with the company to sort out the issue,” said BRTS’s chief executive officer (CEO) Inderjit Singh Chawla.He said, “For now, we see little hope that the service will start anytime soon as the situation in Amritsar is critical. All the buses are air-conditioned and there is no order from the government for running AC buses. We are suffering around ₹30 lakh every month, including the salary and the maintenance.”The first phase of the project was inaugurated in December 2016 by the then deputy chief minister (CM) Sukhbir Singh Badal during the Shiromani Akali Dal-Bharatiya Janata Party (SAD-BJP) regime. The project was revamped and re-inaugurated in January 2019 by the then local bodies minister Navjot Singh Sidhu. The Punjab Bus Metro Society (PBMS), a society under Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB), which runs the project, later announced concession scheme to attract passengers, offering 100% discount for school students, 66% for college students, 50% for senior citizens and people with disabilities, and 20% for general public. But, despite this, the project failed to attract passengers.“We need ₹2.5 lakh daily for fuel and as much to meet other costs. We sustain only if there is daily income of ₹5 lakh, which comes out to around 20,000 passengers daily,” said a bus driver.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-leaves-amritsar-s-brts-project-gasping/story-akdZl5SmYmU8y8n5TxRbpI.html
10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh Smart City Limited to pitch in ₹11 crore to augment city’s water storage capacity||The Chandigarh Smart City Ltd (CSCL) will be giving Rs 11 crore to the municipal corporation to increase city’s water storage capacity.This was decided in the CSCL board of directors’ meeting held here on Wednesday.MC had approved Rs 38 crore for the water storage project. But with only Rs 27 crore available for it, the project couldn’t take off. The civic body even approached the UT administration to fill in the gap of Rs 11 crore, but it was not approved. Now with the financial assistance coming from CSCL, MC will float a tender for the project next week.WHY MORE STORAGE?Increasing city’s water shortage capacity is crucial to ensure continuous supply. At present, the Sector 39 waterworks reservoir can hold water enough for only half-day supply, which the project aims to double.The water received in the morning from Kajauli waterworks is supplied in the evening, while the evening storage is supplied the next morning.With the peak water demand in summer touching 120-125 MGD (million gallons daily), the current availability of 90-95 MGD remains inadequate. Besides, any disruption in water supply from the Kajauli waterworks due to pipe leakages or maintenance works also affects city’s supply, making the need for increased storage capacity more relevant by the day.OTHER AGENDASThe board also approved the proposal to build three material recovery-cum-transfer centres. These will be used to segregate dry, wet and hazardous garbage of the city. Thereon, the garbage will be sent to the dumping ground in Dadumajra.The controversial animal carcass incinerator plant was also approved. MC has already allotted the work for its construction in Sector 25 West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-smart-city-limited-to-pitch-in-11-crore-to-augment-city-s-water-storage-capacity/story-UW2ErIOpxSagqeivMtWH4K.html

He hails from Havelian village near the India-Pakistan border that has gained notoriety in the past few years for cross-border smuggling of drugs.He faces FIRs in 15 cases, including that for drug smuggling from Pakistan and attempt to murder charges, in various districts of Punjab. He has been lodged in a Patiala jail after his arrest in August 2019 with 750 gram heroin.Senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruv Dahiya said they froze the assets after receiving an order from the competent authority.He said, “The assets include agricultural land at Dhalla village which is worth ₹1.05 crore and land at Mohali’s Jhanjeri village which is worth ₹7.08 crore.”He said police had already seized Billa’s property worth ₹74 lakh in 2019.Billa has been involved in drug smuggling for nearly three decades.

10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Smartphone condition hinders door-to-door mapping project in Punjab||The Punjab health department’s much ambitious door-to-door community surveillance project to contain Covid-19 has hit rough weather at the onset as lowly-paid ASHA workers are struggling to arrange ‘latest smartphones’ for updating data on the government app in real time.The household survey, for the time-being, has been launched in urban slums of Mohali district and rural areas of Patiala district but has not been able to pick pace.As most accredited social health activist (ASHA) workers earn ₹2,000-3,000 per month, they rue that all of them cannot afford smartphones with particular specifications, a prerequisite for the purpose.As per the orders, an ASHA worker will cover 25 families daily and be paid ₹4 per household. Thus, maximum an ASHA worker can earn in a day is ₹100.In the household survey, which ASHA workers and other volunteers (government has also roped in anganwadi workers) have to complete, the health status of a person will be updated in real time through the app. Those found symptomatic will be tested for Covid-19.“The department is playing a joke on us. The officials expect all of us to have latest smartphones for a work which we will earn ₹100 from in a day. The department officials say the activists can borrow phone from family members or relatives in case they don’t have their own. Can a family member or a relative spare his or her phone for entire day?” says Kirandeep Panjola, state president of ASHA Workers and Facilitators’ Union. She says either the department should hike the payment for the job or provide tabs or mobile phones to the workers.There are around 28,000 ASHA workers in Punjab whose services are taken for carrying out surveys and mapping of ailments.A health official supervising the survey in Patiala said the survey has hit the roadblock as all ASHA workers don’t have the smartphones with particular specifications to update the data properly.The June 4 order of the health department to all civil surgeons says that in places where ASHA/anganwadi workers are not available or are unable to use the mobile app, other volunteers may be engaged for the job.“The volunteer should have his/her own mobile phone and comfortable in feeding data directly on the app,” reads the order.In different orders last week, the health department has also asked community health officers, pharmacists, rural pharmacists and nurses, AYUSH doctors and rural medical officer to fill the proforma of RT-PCR testing online through the phone-based app.“I had bought an expensive smartphone two years back. I had to free space to upload the RT-PCR app and still it’s not working properly. I asked for technical assistance from my department and officials told me that we need to have latest smartphones,” a rural medical officer deployed in Sangrur said.Director, health and family welfare, Dr Avneet Kaur, was not available for a comment. Health minister Balbir Sidhu said he has not received any complaint regarding the issue so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/smartphone-condition-hinders-door-to-door-mapping-project-in-punjab/story-Ez2J2XPYdavKL8mIrjhIxN.html

10-06-2020||Mumbai||On your feet! Zaveri Bazar picking up momentum one day at a time||Every time a photograph of Zaveri Bazar crops up in front of our eyes, the crowded lanes and throngs of people fail to catch our attention. Yet, what’s surprising is that in a span of a few months, this very photograph is enough to startle even the most optimistic among us.Known for its jewellery showrooms, the shops opened on Friday after a two month lockdown. The shop owners are aware that it will take some time for the industry to bounce back and they feel accepting this reality is the first step towards normalcy. The government has asked the shopkeepers to follow the odd-even rule, and this decision has brought some cheer in the market, making people optimistic about days to come. According to reports, there are around 3,000 stores in the area. #OfficialUpdateMahaGuidelines for ‘Easing of Restrictions and Phase-wise opening of Lockdown’, issued by the Government of Maharashtra.#MissionBeginAgain#NaToCorona pic.twitter.com/g5unvoNWee“It is a good step, as in, we had to slowly get back on our feet. Except Bombay, many places had already opened up. Business hasn’t picked up quickly, but that was expected. We can say that it has picked up at the rate of 25-30%,” says, Vinod Jain, director, Indian Bullion and Jewellers Association (IBJW). Jain also quips that from now on, jewellery store managers will now have to get used to people entering their stores wearing masks.For the secretary of IBJW, Surendra Mehta, it all depends on the city’s lifeline – the local trains. “It might be easier for people nearby to travel. But, many who work in the city, live in the suburbs. So, as long as train services are shut, the backbone of the city will be weak.”IBJW is a 101-year-old organisation which oversees the entire jewellery supply chain in the country. Everything from bullions to mines-to-market comes under its umbrella. According to the guidelines, it will be mandatory for jewellers to not have more than 3 people inside the showroom at a time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/on-your-feet-zaveri-bazar-picking-up-momentum-one-day-at-a-time/story-Vk1Z8Fqddx7ECNFg8zM4lJ.html
10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Firing in Chandigarh: Gunshots were fired to instil fear not kill, gangster Bishnoi’s aide tells police||Operating a well-organised extortion racket from behind the bars, gangster Lawrence Bishnoi had issued directions to his key aide Deepu Banur, who too is jailed, to orchestrate the firing outside a businessman’s house in Sector 33, Chandigarh, only “to instil fear and not to kill”.“I was simply following orders,” is what Deepu is learnt to have told police during his interrogation in connection with firing outside the bungalow of hotelier and businessman Rakesh Singla, elder brother of liquor baron Arvind Singla, on May 31.Deepu was brought on production warrants from the Ambala jail on Tuesday and is in five-day police remand.Chandigarh Police are now trying to bring Bishnoi — the mastermind — on production warrants from the Bharatpur jail in Rajasthan. Bishnoi’s list of crimes in the city is quite long, including the murder of Sonu Shah, a property dealer, in broad daylight on September 28, 2019. Sources said Bishnoi uses his aides to make extortion calls. Earlier, at least seven businessmen have complained of such calls. Bizmen across region on targetOfficials privy to the investigations said Deepu has also revealed that the firing was part of a larger conspiracy to target different businessmen in Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh.“The motive revealed so far was extortion by instilling fear,” said Charanjit Singh, deputy superintendent of police. He said raids are being conducted in Patiala and Ambala in search of all those involved. So far one of the five shooters — a 23-year-old hotel management student — and two men who provided logistical support have been arrested.Bishnoi allegedly used WhatsApp to call Deepu and direct him to arrange shooters as well as provide logistical support. Deepu reportedly told police that as the motive was to just instil fear, no trained shooter was engaged and the youngsters tasked with it were asked to fire maximum rounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/firing-in-chandigarh-gunshots-were-fired-to-instil-fear-not-kill-gangster-bishnoi-s-aide-tells-police/story-5ORHfpQvCJVnrKcLR66wHP.html
10-06-2020||Delhi||Wind, rain, lockdown keep pollution levels in check||Strong winds, frequent showers and vehicular and industrial restrictions during the two-and-a-half month-long lockdown have helped keep pollution levels in the national Capital in check.On Wednesday, the average Air Quality Index reading of the city was recorded at 152, in the ‘moderate’ range. This, however, dipped further to reach 128 in lower end of the ‘moderate’ range after some parts of the city witnessed thunderstorm and heavy rain, with wind speed touching 40-50kmph. Light rainfall was also recorded in parts of the city on June 3, June 4, June 5 and June 7, which also helped keep pollution under control.On Wednesday, the maximum temperature at the Safdarjung observatory, considered the official recording of the city, was 41.5 degrees Celsius. At the Palam observatory, the maximum temperature recorded during the day was 43.6 degrees Celsius. However, after the evening’s rain, the temperature at Safdarjung fell by four degrees and at Palam, the temperature fell by seven degrees, according to IMD. The temperature is expected to fall further by 2-3 degrees in the next few days, the IMD forecast said.“Cyclonic circulation over north Rajasthan and a trough from north Pakistan to the low-pressure area over the Bay of Bengal was observed on Wednesday, which resulted in the thunderstorm and rain in the Delhi-NCR region. This not only helped bring the temperature under control, but it also helped blow away pollution particles,” Kuldeep Srivastava, head of India Meteorological Department’s regional weather forecasting centre, said. Recordings maintained by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) show that since March 25, when a nationwide lockdown was announced, the AQI readings of Delhi have largely remained in the ‘satisfactory’ category. Even though the pollution levels in the city are generally lower in summers when compared to winters, this year’s levels were much lower compared to previous years.Data from 2015 to 2019 shows that in the period between March and June, the pollution levels usually remain in the latter end of the ‘moderate’ or in the middle range of the ‘poor’ category.Scientists at IMD said that along with the restrictions on human activities since March 25, the national Capital has also benefitted from the increased number of western disturbances (WDs) that have crossed the city this year. Even if the WDs did not bring rain on several occasions, they did result in increased wind speed that caused pollution particles to dissipate. From June 1, when the lockdown restrictions were lifted, the AQI levels have remained in the ‘moderate’ zone.Data shows that six WDs passed Delhi in March and six in April, which is unlikely for these months. This trend, however, began in January, when nine WDs passed Delhi. Seven WDs passed the city in February. Usually, on an average, the months of January to June see four WDs each.Pawan Gupta, a senior scientist (earth sciences) at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s (NASA) Universities Space Research Association (USRA), agreed that there has been a visible dip in the pollution levels all over northern India, including Delhi. Gupta is heading a study at NASA to examine the effect of the lockdown on pollution levels in India by studying the aerosol optical depth (AOD) levels, recorded through satellite images.AOD is an indirect proxy for air quality that shows how solid and liquid particles in polluted air block sunlight. It represents particle loading in the entire atmosphere from the surface to top-of-the-atmosphere as opposed to PM2.5 levels, which are measured at the surface.“There are a lot of factors behind the reduction in pollution levels, along with restrictions in human activities such as vehicular movement and industrial operations and fires. The weather has also played an important role,” Gupta said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/wind-rain-lockdown-keep-pollution-levels-in-check/story-WNLLynisOFUkfYJy8NL95J.html

The victim first approached the police after another such episode of domestic violence on May 26 and 27, when she claimed to be injured in the head, back, shoulder and left arm. She has also said in her complaint that, initially, the ASI posted at Rurka police post of Goraya refused to get her medically examined. The complaint was finally lodged on June 1. “After the complaint, we sent a police team to Sharma’s house with a notice asking him to join investigation, but he was not found at home. Our inquiry has found that Sharma, who is posted in Patiala district, thrashed his wife, and also abused and defamed her,” the SHO added.

10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Amritsar civil surgeon seeks action against private labs over ‘false’ Covid reports||The Amritsar civil surgeon on Wednesday wrote a letter to the Punjab health department demanding action against city-based private laboratories after their Covid-19 test reports were found contradicting the results of Government Medical College (GMC). Five Amritsar residents, including a pregnant woman, who were first tested positive for the coronavirus by the private labs, were later found negative by the GMC’s viral research and diagnostic laboratory (VRDL).Civil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore said, “Recently, 18 residents of the district were tested positive for Covid-19 at the Tuli Diagnostic Centre, and the Bhasin Pathology Lab. As per protocol, the patients were immediately isolated at GMCH. The hospital authorities took their swab samples for re-testing. Of the 18, five tested negative at the GMC lab. This led to a lot of confusion and swab samples of these patients were tested again the next day only to find that the reports of the private labs were wrong. Four reports came from Tuli Diagnostic Centre and one from Bhasin Pathology Lab,” he added.REPORTS DECLARED AS PER SAMPLES: LAB OWNERDr Rohan Tuli, owner of the Tuli Diagnostic Centre, said, “We had received the swab samples from a private hospital and test reports were declared positive accordingly. We have conducted many tests in the past days and all the results have been found matching with those of the GMC. Our lab is approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).”“We are ready to submit our reports to the health department, if needed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amritsar-civil-surgeon-seeks-action-against-private-labs-over-false-covid-reports/story-jbtVoWmYFP1qSyYMeZrGlL.html

10-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi University admissions set to begin from June 20||The admission process for various undergraduate, postgraduate, MPhil, and PhD courses in Delhi University is set to begin on June 20, university officials said on Wednesday. Applicants will get at least a two-week window till July 4 to submit their registration forms on the website.The decision was taken at the three-hour-long standing committee meeting of the academic council —the varsity’s highest academic body. Officials at DU’s Computer Centre (DUCC), the varsity’s central IT institution, said that barring technical and administrative glitches, the registration process is likely to start on June 20.Arun Kumar Attree, a member of the standing committee, said, “The registration portal is to be opened from June 20 to July 4 for all courses. The second window will be opened for updating marks after the declaration of results by the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE). The first cutoff, which will also be dependent on that, is likely to come out between the second and third week of August.”Last year, the online registration process was carried out between May 30 and June 22 and the first cut-off was announced on June 28. This year, the academic calendar has been delayed by nearly two months.Officials said the dates of the first cut-off would depend on the pending Class 12 CBSE examination, which is slated to be conducted between July 1 and 15. “Due to the ongoing increase in Covid-19 cases in some areas, there is a possibility that the CBSE may not be able to conduct Class 12 exams and instead consider pre-board results from schools. We have to look at that possibility as well,” Attree said.The academic council member had also proposed the removal of admission cancellation fee of ₹1,000 for marginalised students, keeping the current economic crisis in mind. However, the committee did not accept his recommendation.“The exorbitant cancellation fee will lead to affluent candidates getting a college or course of their choice and further discouraging marginalised students from having multiple options. Disadvantaged students should be allowed to cancel their admission for free between three cut-offs at least,” Attree said, adding that he recorded his dissent.The university has also decided not to conduct trials for admissions under Sports or Extra-Curricular Activities (ECA) category this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Under these admissions, applicants excelling in sports or ECA categories listed by the varsity would get a chance to secure a seat through trials and merit certificates. In DU colleges, 5% supernumerary seats are reserved under these two categories collectively in each course.This year, however, the university has decided to grant admissions to sports candidates across 27 disciplines on the basis of their certificates entirely. For ECA, the university will only take admissions on the basis of National Cadet Corps (NCC) and National Service Scheme (NSS) certificates instead of the 14 activities listed every year. In May, Hindustan Times had reported that the varsity was considering such measures in the wake of the health crisis arising out of Covid-19.Former sports council chairperson, CS Dubey, endorsed the move as it would be “better” under the given circumstances. He, however, cautioned against fraudulent certificates. “Earlier, sports trials were conducted by the college and 75% weightage was given to certificates and 25% to trials. To tackle the problem of fake certificates, the weightage to trials was later on increased 40%,” he said.Currently, under the sports quota, candidates have to appear for trials in their preferred discipline. While the trials carry 60%, the other 40% are allotted based on merit certificates.“This is the first time since then [2011] that sports trials will not be conducted. This is, however, better, considering social distancing norms and whether applicants will be able to travel to the university or not. However, care should be taken to deal with fraudulent certificates,” Dubey, who has served as the sports council chairperson for nearly a decade, said.On Wednesday, the committee also agreed that “any discrepancy in the spelling of a name or missing surname in the certificates of SC/ST/OBC/EWS/PwD shall be verified from their other certificates rather than rejecting their admission”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-university-admissions-set-to-begin-from-june-20/story-yftpLKzxFKsqUurWYW0b6L.html
10-06-2020||Delhi||Epca asks for report on biomedical waste generation and disposal; will submit before SC next week||The Supreme Court-mandated Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Authority (Epca) on Wednesday conducted a video meeting with the state pollution control boards and municipalities of Delhi-NCR asking them for a detailed report on the quantity of biomedical waste generated by hospitals and quarantine centres since the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic. The body has also asked for details on whether this hazardous waste was being disposed of safely.Epca chairperson Bhure Lal said that representatives from Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan attended Wednesday’s meeting. The states have been asked to submit the required information in the next three days, after which a detailed report on the generation and handling of biomedical waste from Covid-designated treatment centres will be submitted before the apex court.“Between March 16 and March 22, we had started inspecting hospitals around Meerut, Ghaziabad, Hapur, Bhiwadi to see how they were segregating biomedical waste and how it was being disposed of. But after such a massive outbreak of Covid-19, we are dealing with more hazardous biomedical waste and we need to know if the states are handling this waste safely,” Lal said after the meeting.He also said that along with data on waste generation and disposal, the SC-mandated body is inspecting whether the garbage collection trucks are fitted with Global Positioning System (GPS) trackers to ensure that the collectors are picking up waste from hospitals, quarantine centres and houses of those under home isolation and are not dumping it midway before reaching the waste treatment centres.“We have found that 90% of these vans are fitted with GPS trackers, but we have asked states to also collect garbage from small clinics in their areas because a lot of asymptomatic patients carry the virus,” Lal said.He added, “We have also asked states to maintain a complete record of the final disposal delivery of biomedical waste. This will ensure that this waste is not recycled and reused.”Epca’s final report will be submitted before the SC within a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/epca-asks-for-report-on-biomedical-waste-generation-and-disposal-will-submit-before-sc-next-week/story-KFUGfanYWSpF1NR0WwRSjL.html

10-06-2020||Noida||Motorists have narrow escape on DND Flyway as hoardings fall in wind||The high winds that swept across Delhi-NCR on Wednesday evening caused hoardings to collapse on the Delhi Noida Direct (DND) Flyway at two places. No one was injured in the mishap.The hoardings collapsed around 5.30pm during the thunderstorm and the winds. “One hoarding collapsed on the side that leads towards Noida while another came crashing on the side going towards Delhi. Vehicles were trapped between the two mishap sites, but no vehicle was damaged or anyone injured. The debris on the Delhi side has been cleared and work is on clean the other side as well,” deputy commissioner of police, zone 1, Sankalp Sharma said.Following the incident, authorities shut the DND flyway and diverted traffic on both sides towards other roads.“The traffic was diverted to Chilla border on both sides to facilitate work to clear the debris. There was congestion at the Mayur Vihar area but normal traffic flow was restored soon,” Kumar Ranvijay Singh, additional DCP, zone 1, said.However, commuters claimed they were stuck in traffic for hours.“Even if police diverted traffic towards Mayur Vihar, we will first have to cross the toll. But because of the debris blocking the road, we were stick on DND for hours. They closed off the flyway, but those of us who were already on the highway can neither turn back nor move forward. It’s a miracle that no one was injured in the collapse,” Anil Arora, a commuter from Delhi to Noida, said.Strong winds and rain lashed Delhi-NCR on Wednesday evening, and the weatherman said it is expected to continue for another few days, keeping the rising mercury under check.According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the current trough line or the low pressure line passes through Pakistan to Bay of Bengal via Rajasthan, which coupled with a western disturbance led to the thundery activities and winds on Wednesday. The activities like high winds, rains or thundershowers will continue in the region.“We expect the maximum temperature to fall from Thursday till June 16 at least,” Kuldeep Srivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre (RWMC), IMD, said.Till the rain came, Wednesday was the warmest June day so far, with a maximum temperature of 41.5 degrees Celsius, two notches above the season’s average, and four degrees more than the previous day’s 37.5 degrees. However, the mercury fell by four degrees around 5pm after the thunderstorm.The storm knocked out power in almost all areas of the district. The transformers in sectors 39 and 126 were also reportedly damaged in the rain and squall. Vijay Singh, a resident of Sector 41, said, “Despite generating maximum revenue in terms of electricity bills, we are destined to live with faulty power transmission lines and electric poles. The maintenance is also poor.”Virendra Nath Singh, chief engineer, Pashchimanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam Limited said restoration of power is being done on war footing. “Most of the areas have got electricity back. And, within a few hours, supply will be restored to other areas well,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/motorists-have-narrow-escape-on-dnd-flyway-as-hoardings-fall-in-wind/story-37c9l7iR62DPs8RyBfK1sN.html

The union also demanded that sweepers and sanitation workers, who have working during the pandemic, should be given a status of safai sainik. They said employees should be covered under insurance policy and pending general provident fund should also be submitted in their accounts at the earliest.Chairman of the committee, Ashwani Sahota, and president Jasdev Sekhon said,” Drivers who have been working with the MC for two decades have not been regularised. We are also demanding that the pay scale of certain employees should be increased and they should be promoted as per policies of the state government.”Sekhon said higher authorities should also not pay heed to complaints made by persons regularly as many of them blackmail MC employees to get their own work done.Following the protest, the union members handed over a memorandum to MC commissioner Kanwalpreet Kaur Brar.Brar could not be reached for her comments.The union also opposed the MC’s decision to conduct survey of labour quarters amid the Covid-19 pandemic. Brar had earlier ordered employees to conduct a survey as part of the ongoing process to increase property tax for labour quarters and other rental properties.SOCIAL DISTANCING GOES FOR A TOSSWhile the administration is forcing residents to maintain social distancing, the MC employees threw caution to the wind by gathering in large numbers to protest against the authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-mc-employees-union-protest-over-non-fulfilment-of-demands/story-OHsCZTfNn9p5W8K1zMjklJ.html
10-06-2020||Pune||Fake currency notes, US dollars worth Rs 47 crore, seized in Pune; Army jawan among six arrested||Pune police crime branch officials arrested six persons, including an Indian Army personnel, in an operation that led to the seizure of fake Indian and foreign currency notes with a face value of at least Rs 43.4 crore and fake US dollars worth Rs 4.2 crore, said a senior official aware of the developments on Wednesday evening.​The joint operation carried out by the Pune police and the Military Intelligence (MI), had been conducted at Sanjay Park in Vimannagar. According to the official, the operation to count the counterfeit notes is still underway. ​“After detailed planning with the MI team, a joint operation was carried out today (Wednesday) in which six persons including one serving military person has been detained with multiple denominations of fake Indian and foreign currency. Counting of currency is going on as per the procedure,” read a statement by Bachchan Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Crime, Pune. ​The arrested six men have been identified as Indian Army jawan Shaikh Alim Gulab Khan, and civilians Sunil Badrinarayan Sarda, Ritesh Ratnakar, Tufail Ahmed Mohammad Ishaq Khan, Abdul Gani Rehmtullah Khan, Abdul Rehman Abdul Gani Khan, according to the police.​“After counting, Indian currency of various denominations worth Rs 43.4 crore and US dollars worth Rs 4.2 crore has been seized. The quality of the notes will be checked in due course by experts. Many of the notes are marked ‘Children Bank of India’,” read a police statement. ​The information about the fake currency operation was provided by officials of military intelligence, according to the police. The fake currency notes were in different denominations, including Rs 1,000, which has been demonetised by the central government in 2016. “Some of these currency notes carried the stamp of ‘Children Bank of India’ and may have been printed before 2016 when the government made the denominations of Rs 1,000 and Rs 500 invalid,” said a defence official aware of the developments on the condition of anonymity. “The amount (Rs 43.4 crore and Rs 4.2 crore) is excluding the worth of Rs 1,000 notes seized. In most of the notes, instead of Reserve Bank of India, it says ‘Children’s Bank of India’. The purpose seems to be cheating. In the bundle of US dollars, the first note is genuine, the rest are counterfeit. These six men had been working together. The person whom they had offered the fake currency, had informed us,” said Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of police, Pune.​A statement released earlier on Wednesday evening by the defence spokesperson, stated, “Southern Command Intelligence wing along with crime branch Pune carried out a successful joint operation in Vimannagar and busted a fake currency racket on June 10. Six people, including five civilians and a soldier, were apprehended with fake Indian and foreign currency to the tune of approximately Rs 10 crore. At least Rs2 lakh in Indian currency, US dollars equivalent and one fake pistol was recovered during the operation.

10-06-2020||Delhi||NHRC serves notices to Delhi, Centre over Covid-19 situation||The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) on Wednesday issued notices to the Delhi government and Union health secretary over the alleged mismanagement of Covid-19 situation in the national capital, asserting that the state “cannot leave its people to die”. It asked Delhi and the Centre to submit reports, after consulting each other, within 10 days.Acting on a complaint by former Delhi Congress President Ajay Maken, the Commission has referred to difficulties faced by the general public due to the non-availability of beds in Delhi’s hospitals for Covid-19 patients and inadequate testing.“Allegedly, there has been massive delay in conducting the last rites of those who died during the pandemic period; tests on the bodies of the symptomatic deceased are also not being conducted, violating the WHO [World Health Organization] and ICMR [Indian Council for Medical Research] norms, which can be extremely dangerous,” NHRC said in a press statement.Observing that Maken had not only levelled allegations, but also provided data to support the complaint, NHRC said the situation raises the issue of government agencies’ “inappropriate approach” to the plight of the general public, amounting to “violation of human rights”. “The data indicates that there is urgent need for taking effective steps immediately by the government agencies,” the NHRC statement read.The Commission has asked both Delhi government and the Centre to submit a comprehensive report within 10 days after consulting with each other, while asking Delhi government to increase the number of beds and tests per day.“It [NHRC] understands that this is an unprecedented situation for the government agencies, hospitals, doctors as well as patients and their families but the state cannot leave its citizens to die without making the best possible efforts. It is not incorrect to state that the number of Covid patients, in the country is increasing day by day and the recovery rate is above 48% but it is also true that a large number of people have died and the national capital is one of the worst affected cities so far,” NHRC said.Maken filed a complaint with NHRC on Tuesday, alleging that suspected patients are running from one hospital to another for admission, but being turned away.“The chart provided [by Maken to NHRC] indicates that the NCT of Delhi has a robust hospital infrastructure of 57,194 beds. It has a significant presence of central government hospitals also but it is painful to see that only 12% of the Delhi government, 8% of the central government institutions and 7% of the private hospital beds are presently occupied and are being used to treat COVID patients,” NHRC said. NHRC also said that around 70% dedicated beds in Delhi are still lying vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nhrc-serves-notices-to-delhi-centre-over-covid-19-situation/story-wIWlGpFEVuis3LqOICzQsL.html

Meanwhile, DU aspirants are busy finding or stitching matching masks to accompany their attires! “I’m so excited to go to college! I can’t wait to be on campus and social distance with my batchmates. I’ve asked my mom to stitch me 10 masks in neutral browns that will go with all my outfits. I have done the lace embroidery on them myself! Me and my mom will together give them a pearl lining,” says Avni Bhatnagar, a resident of Delhi’s Vasant Kunj. Some freshers have been shopping online for the mask that best suits their style. “I have ordered 15 masks in various patterns from online portals. Some of the masks I’ve ordered have millineal phrases written across them such as ‘Stay Woke’. I think it’ll create a good first impression on everyone when I’ll don such a mask with a message,” says Deeksha Nautiyal, a resident of DLF Phase 2, Gurugram. Internet seems to be the place of inspiration for youngsters keen on making DIY masks. “YouTube has quite a few easy tutorials on how one can stitch and decorate their own masks. I’m following a few tutorials and I’ve made five masks, all by myself! My friends have started asking me to make some for them too,” says Nancy Wadhwa, a resident of Delhi’s Model Town. Recycling old clothes to make masks is another hack that youngsters have used to make hand crafted masks. “My mother has plenty of old silk cotton Banarasi and Bandhani saris that she has no use of. I’ve used the borders of her saris along with a matching cotton cloth to make beautiful masks that could go with kurtis and jeans. I bet my mask will be among the most beautiful masks in my batch,” says Nayantara Tripathi, a resident of Sector 21, Noida.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/du-aspirants-mask-game-on-stitch-buy-borrow-anything-to-up-the-style-game-on-campus/story-Nw5CN6XqzW0bypZXlLlxdO.html

10-06-2020||Lifestyle||DU student’s rental woes: Landlords ask students to pay for luggage occupying PG rooms||The troubles for Delhi University students just don’t seem to end. Many of those who had been putting up in PGs and hostels are reportedly being asked to pay rent for the entire period of the lockdown. Pooja Meena, a student of BA(Hons) from Indraprastha College For Women, says, “I don’t have the money to pay the rent. My father recently lost his job; the economy has been hit so bad. So even though my things are kept in the PG in Delhi, I decided to come back home in Nagpur, because my landlady would otherwise visit me everyday asking for rent... How do I pay her when I barely have money to give my fees?” Some students have had to make other living arrangements, such as moving to their friends’ house, because of not being able to pay rent. Take for instance, Alka Yadav, a Political Science (Hons) student of Ramjas College. “I don’t have any money to give to the landlord and he has been giving me ultimatums. He was about to call the police to evict me because of non payment of rent. I left the PG and went to stay at my friends house. But is this fair? When the country is undergoing a pandemic, must the landlords not be understanding of the plight of their residents?” asks Yadav. To raise this concern, the Delhi University Student Union (DUSU), along with 128 other representatives from various DU colleges have written to the government to request financial assistance for students who are unable to pay their rent. “Many students in DU are facing a financial crunch due to the pandemic. These students have nowhere to go, and the ones who are currently in their PG, continue to get pestered for rents. The ones who left for their home towns are scared of coming back to DU, since they have no place to live because they were either evicted for non payment of rentals or asked to leave so that others who can pay, could be accommodated. In such troubling times, the authorities must come forward to help all such students,” says Munish Chaudhary, president, Law Centre -1, DU.Akshit Dahiya, president, DUSU adds, “Many students have gone to their home towns, leaving their belongings in their PGs and hostels because they don’t have the money to pay for rent. Now the landlords are pestering these students to pay rent for the luggage that is occupying the room. In such circumstances, we have reached out to the government for monetary help or application of some sort of law that warrants waiver of rentals for students for the months in which lockdown was in place.” Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaRead more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/more-lifestyle/du-student-s-rental-woes-landlords-ask-students-to-pay-for-luggage-occupying-pg-rooms/story-DbzDX3eRAqDoyhX45EmvQN.html

Hence, the signing would have taken place maximum by July 2. However, due to the pandemic, the developer had requested the state government to extend the date of signing by 120 days. The signing has been deferred till August 17,” Bhatia told PTI.He said Zurich Airport’s SPV YIAPL has three directors, one of whom lives in India, while the other two are based in Malaysia and Switzerland.“The presence of at least two directors is required for the signing of the agreement,” he said.The officer added that in case the Covid-19 situation does not improve even in August, the cabinet will review the circumstances and take an appropriate decision on the signing date of the agreement.On November 29 last year, Swiss firm Zurich Airport emerged as the highest bidder to develop the Jewar airport on the outskirts of Delhi in Gautam Buddh Nagar district of UP, outbidding competitors like Adani Enterprises, DIAL and Anchorage Infrastructure Investments Holding.The entire project will be spread over 5,000 hectares and is estimated to cost Rs 29,560 crore, the officials said.Once completed, the airport, which will be the third in the national capital region after Delhi’s Indira Gandhi International Airport and Ghaziabad’s Hindon Airport, is touted to have six to eight runways, the most in India, they said.The first phase of the airport would be spread over 1,334 hectares and is expected to be completed by 2023 at a cost of Rs 4,588 crore, the officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/signing-date-of-jewar-airport-s-key-pact-deferred-due-to-covid-19-pandemic/story-VqYRs5RiRki6XU22Fe9kiI.html

She further alleged that Shaikh then sent three messages on her mobile pronouncing ‘Talaq’ and declaring that it resulted into the dissolution of their marriage and thereafter started avoiding her and refused to take care of the newborndaughter.Apart from invoking section 3 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019 which penalises divorce by pronouncing talaq by spoken or written words or by electronic means, Ghatkopar police had also invoked charge of rape against Shaikh.Justice Dangre, however, found that the charge of rape was not sustainable, as the complainant was not forcibly made to enter into a sexual relationship since the woman herself claimed that they had performed marriage as per the Muslim customs.As regards the charge under section 3 of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, the judge said the offence was bailable - and therefore the police sub-inspector was entitled to pre-arrest bail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-grants-bail-to-psi-booked-for-divorcing-wife-through-message/story-V0LEehu0CFmtzTPgqH261L.html

We want Lieutenant Governor GC Murmu to order a judicial probe into the killing to unveil the conspiracy and the negligence in protecting the precious lives,” Mir said while addressing reporters here.“We want to know why a particular group is being targeted in a particular area and what is the motive behind such killings,” he said, adding that the latest killing has caused a fear among the elected representatives, especially among minority leaders. The time demands that a fresh security assessment is made and those elected members be provided security who are living in vulnerable areas or facing threat to their lives, Mir said. Former minister and senior Congress leader Raman Bhalla also charged the UT administration of adopting dual yardsticks and discriminatory approach in the matter of security to political leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/j-k-cong-protests-against-sarpanch-killing-demands-judicial-probe/story-AFYnvnpJmsoF4ZUc6C0SzN.html

10-06-2020||Mumbai||Do you intend to extend gag on public, HC asks Mumbai Police||The Bombay high court on Tuesday sought to know if the Mumbai police intended to extend the “gag order” - order issued on May 23 under section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code that made criticising the government and its functioning a punishable offence.The court was hearing a petition filed by Navi Mumbai resident and journalist Rajeev Mishra, through advocate DP Singh, challenging the May 23 order on the ground that it was violative of the freedom of speech and expression. Prohibitory orders under section 144 are being issued right from the beginning of the nationwide lockdown given the coronavirus pandemic and are being renewed from time to time. Mishra has complained that the section 144 order issued on May 23 not only prohibited dissemination of fake news, incorrect information and other objectionable content on various social media platforms but also specifically stated that legal action will be taken against those criticising the state and its functioning in the times of COVID-19.Amongst other directives, the order prohibits any person from inciting mistrust towards government functionaries and their actions taken to prevent the spread of the Covid-19 and thereby causing danger to human health or safety or a disturbance to the public tranquillity and specifically stared that any person contravening this prohibitory order will be prosecuted under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code, the petition added.According to Mishra’s counsel, advocate Amogh Singh, this gag on public speaking against the state government’s functioning was completely in breach of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution and therefore liable to be struck down.However, when the petition came up for hearing on Tuesday, assistant public prosecutor Madhavi Mhatre pointed out that the order under challenge has expired on June 8, and the petition had become infructuous.The bench of justice Ujjal Bhuyan and justice Riyaz Chagla sought to know if the police authorities intended to extend the gag by extending the order dated May 23 or by issuing similar order. The bench adjourned the petition till June 23 after the prosecutor sought time to answer the query.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/do-you-intend-to-extend-gag-on-public-hc-asks-mumbai-police/story-cPsI8AFIcntZiAT3tYypLN.html

While addressing mediapersons at the exhibition ground here, the panchayat members, who came from Kashmir, said, “We are nothing more than sitting ducks.”Manoj Pandita, sarpanch of Lajora in Kakapora area of Pulwama district, said, “Following an initiative by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and home minister Amit Shah to hold panchayat elections and initiate a political process, we participated in the polls despite threats from terror outfits. We were happy that we will be returning home.”“The Centre and the UT administration should have given a serious thought about our security. On Monday, Ajay was killed. Tomorrow they will kill someone else. What is also disheartening is that no one from the administration has so far visited Ajay’s family to console his wife and two young daughters,” he said.“Ajay was the backbone of grassroot democracy in Kashmir. I request the administration to visit his daughters so that they can feel that their father sacrificed his life for India and was not a militant,” he added.“We were born and grew up in the Valley. We belong to that soil but security certainly remains a prime concern for us,” he added.Pandita said panchayat polls had rekindled a ray of hope among Kashmiris Pandits to return to their motherland and work for welfare of poor in their respective villages. He, however, said a person who was a nationalist in Kashmir was always on the hitlist of Pakistan-funded terror outfits.Meanwhile, president of the All Jammu and Kashmir Panchayat Conference, Anil Sharma said, “After Ajay Pandita’s killing, half a dozen sarpanches fled Kashmir in panic and reached Jammu. They were not given any help by the administration and we ensured that they reach here.”“I have been getting calls from sarpanches and panches in Valley saying that they are ready to resign. However, I have asked them not to do so as it will allow Pakistani machinations to succeed,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/cong-sarpanch-killing-panchayat-members-in-valley-demand-security-cover-from-government/story-gvbUgpkwFeDf0jjhJJB24K.html

Earlier in the day, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, underscoring that it is not the time for disagreements, said Lt Guv’s decision to not reserve hospitals exclusively for Delhi residents for Covid-19 treatment will be followed in “letter and spirit”.On Monday, the L-G overruled the state government’s decision to reserve hospitals, except those run by the centre, for residents of Delhi. The state government’s decision to test only those showing symptoms of Covid-19 was also overturned, allowing asymptomatic cases and high-risk contacts of a virus patient to be tested.In a letter, the L-G’s office said that “Delhi belongs to all” and that none can be denied treatment for not being a resident of the national capital.According to the Delhi government’s projection, there will be 44,000 cases by June 15, one lakh cases by June 30 going up to 2.25 lakh cases by July 15 and 5.5 lakh cases by July 31.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-hospitals-to-display-number-of-beds-room-charges-at-entry-point-orders-lt-guv-baijal/story-CjBWcQVoY6XyLkYzk2m0zJ.html

10-06-2020||Mumbai||Trees chopped at south Konkan wildlife corridor; foresters assaulted, violators booked||Despite a Bombay high court order declaring the Dodamarg-Swantwadi belt in south Konkan as a no tree felling zone, local residents have been booked for assaulting forest officers and indiscriminate tree felling in the area.According to the forest department, members from the youth wing of the state’s ruling party Shiv Sena in Sindhudurg district managed to cut large number of trees across a two-acre patch near Bambarde village in the proposed wildlife corridor area in Dodamarg taluka on June 4.The two-acre area falls within the ambit of deemed reserved forest with over 50 small trees. Around 20 large trees allegedly uprooted by residents, said forest officers.“On receiving this information, our team went to the site to file a punchnama and assess damages when we faced severe backlash from locals who abused and assaulted us, and asked us to leave the site,” said Dayanand Kokre, range forest officer, Dodamarg, one of the assaulted officers.V Clement Ben, chief conservator of forest, Kolhapur said the team was directed to rush to the nearest police station and file a complaint. “We are yet to assess the total loss of trees, which were uprooted using an excavator machine (see image). The violators are on the run and we expect law will take its own course,” he said.A first-information-report (FIR) was filed against four persons - Madan Rane, Dayanand Rane, Sandesh Rane, Suraj Rane, and Daulat Rane in violation of section 353 (assault or criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty) by the police, said Samadhan Chavan, deputy conservator of forest, Sawantwadi. “They are all in the age group of 30 to 35. Additionally, we have filed a preliminary offence report (POR) in violation of the Indian Forest Act, 1927, for illicit tree felling,” he said.Chavan added that the area used to be a private forest but was acquired by the state in 1978 under the Maharashtra Private Forests (Acquisition) Act, 1975. It was later declared as deemed reserved forest. “Locals had objected to this as they had not received compensation, and the case is in litigation. But this does not give them the right to cut trees.,” he said.Sena politician Vinayak Raut, elected Member of Parliament from the Ratnagiri-Sindhudurg constituency said, “Planting of trees in private forest areas is being done by locals on land belonging to them but there is a strict ban on any tree felling. Everyone is aware about it. I will take stock of the matter to check what happened at the site,” he said.The Bombay high court (HC) in 2013, based on 2011 petition by Awaaz Foundation, had directed the Union environment ministry and state to ensure the corridor is protected as an eco-sensitive area (ESA) where mining and red category industries are prohibited. The HC had reiterated its order in 2018, based on NGO Vanashakti’s petition in 2016, declaring the entire belt as a ‘no tree felling zone’. “It is shameful that forest officer’s are being attacked for doing their duty. The minister concerned needs to take action to ensure there is deterrence in such cases,” said Stalin D, petitioner.A local forest officer requesting anonymity said, “The area had mixed plantation before being felled and following our intervention, the accused claimed they wanted to plant cashew trees. However, basic investigation with locals in the area revealed that they had planned to build a resort, and not less than 150 trees have been uprooted.”WHY DOES IT MATTER?The Dodamarge-Sawantwadi corridor is home to tigers, leopards, elephants, sloth bears, civets, pangolins, several resident and migratory bird species, and even the Indian giant squirrel (Maharashtra’s state animal). The forest department confirmed that over the past five years, transient movement of close to 25 tigers has been observed at the corridor while an elephant family of five reside there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/trees-chopped-at-south-konkan-wildlife-corridor-foresters-assaulted-violators-booked/story-4hg7BcHEFNJ634nuLkUR0M.html
10-06-2020||Real||UP govt reduces interest rates on land dues for builders in Noida, Greater Noida||The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday asked the three industrial development authorities in Gautam Buddh Nagar to reduce interest rates on land dues in view of the COVID-19 pandemic. The decision was conveyed to the Noida Authority, the Greater Noida Authority (GNIDA) and the Yamuna Expressway Authority (YEIDA) in an official letter by Alok Kumar, Principal Secretary, Industries and Infrastructure Development, UP. Developers and real estate bodies like Naredco and Credai hailed the move, saying it will make projects financially more viable and significantly benefit home buyers. “There will be no interest for delay on land dues which were to be cleared between March 22 and June 30 if payment is made by June 30,” according to the letter. “Those who deposit their dues scheduled between March 22 and June 30, by September 30 would be charged a simple interest (SI). This SI would be counted from March 22 till the date of payment,” the letter stated. On all the dues paid between July 1 and September 30, the concerned authority will charge simple interest, it said. “If these dues are not cleared by September 30, then default interest will be applicable on entire period of delay,” it added. The letter also made it clear that date of payment for land dues scheduled in future will not be changed, and they will be “as per lease deed”. “In the first round relief, the government has allowed Noida Authority, GNIDA and YEIDA to charge interest on balance outstanding at MCLR (marginal cost of fund-based lending rate) +1 per cent. It is a big relief to developers which will help us to deliver projects fast to home buyers,” Naredco UP President and Supertech Chairman R K Arora said. Realtor’s body CREDAI’s NCR unit president Pankaj Bajaj said for allotments to builders, the authority rate of interest on instalment was practically coming to more than 15 per annum. “Due to the slowdown in the market in the last four years, this rate of interest made most projects in Noida and Greater Noida financially unviable. If projects become sick, not only is homebuyer’s investment at risk but even the Authority’s paper receivables become doubtful,” he said. He added that CREDAI had been requesting for making rate of interest reasonable and linking it to MCLR. “The revised rate is around 9 per cent per annum. This makes a material difference to the economic viability of projects in this region. Ultimately it benefits the homebuyer by making the projects more healthy and assuring delivery, Bajaj said. Ashish Bhutani, CEO, Bhutani Infra, said the step has come in right course of time, the moratoriums for delivery was a big relief and now with interest rates getting reduced this will be another relief to thousand of property owners. “The interest deferment will ease out the cash flow and developers would be able to focus on delivery of projects,” Bhutani said. Manoj Gaur, MD, Gaurs Group and Chairman of Credai’s Affordable Housing Committee said the move will provide much needed help at this moment of crisis for industry as a whole. “This will reduce the burden on the developers, the ultimate beneficiary will be home buyers. The move will definitely give a relief to the affected developers,” Gaur said. Ashok Gupta, CMD, Ajnara India said the decision will ease out some burden. “Developers are already busy going to the drawing board to make marketing strategies and other operational nuances in post COVID-19 scenario. This decision of authority has come as a relief,” he added. Vikas Bhasin, MD, SAYA Homes said that the lockdown waiver of interest rate on authority dues will help the developers manage funds for activities that can expedite the sale process. “We wish that other measures too will come the sector’s way to ease out the burden,” Bhasin said. Dhiraj Jain, Director, Mahagun Group said he hoped the state government would also come out with other measures, including a relief package, for the sector. “Real estate is an important part of the country’s economy and anything for this sector will ultimately help in quick economic recovery,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/real-estate/up-govt-reduces-interest-rates-on-land-dues-for-builders-in-noida-greater-noida/story-d6k8olTD7mme5gYZOqS8XL.html

10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Salute to tech warriors running world from home||Confined to our homes waiting for the Covid-19 pandemic to wane, a substantial percentage of the working population is now forced to work from home. This population is born in the previous century and can’t be included in the category of digital natives. It’s but natural that the majority is not comfortable with online platforms that are mandatory for work from home. And it is here that the younger generation is being seen as a guiding force.For once, it’s the time when elders have to listen to what children are teaching them. Whether it’s a grandchild, a son or a daughter or a much younger cousin, a colleague or a neighbourhood friendly chap who we keep pestering with our frantic phone calls, they have all risen to the occasion. They teach, guide and advise their parents, uncles, aunts, teachers, or other figures in authority about how to download apps, make groups, fix meetings, create videos, send content and connect with their workplace team to keep the official and social communication channels open without hassle.While attending online classes, youngsters watch their fumbling and ill-at-ease teachers with sympathy and patience, helpfully offering suggestions for correcting the glitches. A Kuchipudi dancer, who has gone digital and is conducting online classes, while acknowledging the technical support of her daughter admits: “It sure helps to have tech-savvy youngsters in the family.”These are the tech warriors doubling up as laptop and cellphone mechanics and go-to saviours when in doubt or logged out.It is not only on the home front that the young are teaching the old, the reverse learning trend is visible in the academic departments also. For once, the junior most colleagues are getting all the authority to run the department from home. They are now the busiest and the most active, innovative and creative figures, conceiving and executing online classes, training programmes, webinars and digital learning solutions. For once, seniors save a few who have kept themselves abreast with technology, have taken the backseat twiddling their tech-phobic thumbs.Irrespective of the cadre, the most sought-after person in the staff is the member with information technology (IT) skills to troubleshoot for their bosses, who have been too engrossed in routine administration to jump on the online bandwagon.I recently came across an online seminar for faculty members being coordinated by a PhD scholar, who is managing the technical paraphernalia. This was unthinkable in a traditional setting two months ago.We, the seniors and experienced are now humbled, our arrogance has bitten the dust and no more will we use such absurd statements: “I know more because I am... your senior/older than you/your mother/your teacher.”Let us salute the young tech warriors who are contributing to running the world from home in this critical period. Life would have ground to a halt without them.The writer is an associate professor at Panjab University, Chandigarh||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/salute-to-tech-warriors-running-world-from-home/story-8ioXBrPKjoJu5z2i9kCy2I.html

10-06-2020||Noida||UP govt reduces interest rate for builders on housing land dues||The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday asked the Noida, Greater Noida and Yamuna Expressway industrial development authorities to reduce the interest rates on land dues for builders and other allottees in view of Covid-19 pandemic. The state government has also asked the three industrial authorities to shift and defer the payments that have to be made by the property allottees, including allottees of 600 housing projects, factory owners, industrial and individual plot allottees, said officials. The decision was taken by the state government after consultation with the CEOs of the three authorities.The UP government directive came after repeated demands made by the developers to provide them with relief in view of the huge business losses incurred due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Noida, Greater Noida and Yeida (Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority) needs to recover at least Rs 35,000 crore in land dues from 600 housing projects and other property defaulters. As the construction was shut down during the period of the national lockdown, real estate developers suffered huge losses and requested the state government to provide them with relief. They said that if interest rates were not reduced and payments were not postponed then they might not be able to survive the crisis. “The interest rates now have to be reduced for all Noida properties as per the state government directive. The penal interest on the authority dues also needs to be deferred as per the state government order,” said Ritu Maheshwari chief executive officer(CEO) of the Noida authority.Alok Kumar principal secretary with the UP infrastructure and industrial development department has directed the CEOs of all industrial bodies including Noida, Greater Noida and Yeida to follow the directive to give relief to property allottees, said officials.Presently, some of the defaulter builders pay penal interest on financial dues up to 20%, thereby increasing the total default amount. The state government has, therefore, asked authorities to levy simple interest on financial dues as per the marginal cost of funds based lending rate (MCLR) revised by the Reserve Bank of India, said officials. Now the authorities shall levy simple interest of 8% on financial dues unlike earlier, said officials. Further, the authorities will not impose any ‘interest on default’ on payments by the developers from March 22 to June 30 provided they clear their dues by June 30, 2020. And if anyone pays defaulted amount that was payable from March 22 to June 30 by September 30, 2020 then simple interest will be imposed unlike earlier when penal interest was to be recovered.If the defaulter does not pay the defaulted amount by September 30, 2020, then interest will be imposed on defaulted amount, said officials.“We welcome the move of the state government. The government has decided to reduce interest rate and decided to charge up to 8% unlike earlier when penal interest would consistently go up. Most of the developers will be able to restructure their dues and clear them. It will help the homebuyers, investors, developers and the real estate sector as a whole. We hope that the government will soon take a decision on our other demands to revive the realty sector,” said RK Arora Uttar Pradesh president of National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO), a developers’ body.When asked about the other demands of the real estate developers, Arun Vir Singh CEO of the Yeida said, “The developers can send their request via email to us and we will process their request as per the decision taken by the state government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/up-government-reduces-interest-rate-for-builders-on-housing-land-dues/story-1sji4TQ97jbLLDZZ9Hdt7N.html
10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Young, gifted and smacked, but black lives matter||The recent death of George Floyd at the hands of the police in Minneapolis led to public outcry in American cities not seen since the 1991 beating up of Rodney King, again by the police. Neither event is rare, and sadly racism persists.My first experience of race in the US came in 1999 when I visited Dalton, Georgia, on business. Work done, I requested my hosts to arrange a car to travel to Atlanta. My taxi arrived and I greeted the driver, a tall, mature Afro-Caribbean. “You remind me of cricketer Clive Lloyd,” I opened, and received a bemused reaction. He opened the rear door, while I motioned that I wanted to sit in the front. My efforts to engage the driver with small talk were all stonewalled. Some 15 minutes later, he suddenly spoke. He wanted to know why I chose to sit in the front seat. I replied that I had hoped to chat on the two-hour drive. The ice having broken, the driver suddenly pointed: “Look over there! That’s where I was born.” I gazed at a non-descript road of a poor neighbourhood. “My grandfather was a slave,” he said. To me that seemed a stretch given that slavery had been abolished in 1865.I asked him whether matters had changed. He said: “A little. I walk into a Walmart and I know that as a black person I will be followed by security cameras. It doesn’t happen to whites.”Our conversation touched upon education, dietary supplements, public housing and health care. He was an informed fellow, capable of far better things than society had allowed him to do.The dialogue was inspirational with profound words that I recall to this day. I felt my driver, a stoical grandfather, lived to survive in spite of society. He said: “Sir, we have surrendered everything to the white community. We have accepted their names, religion, clothes, food, in fact their entire culture, yet we feel rejected.”Finally, we reached the hotel in Atlanta. I invited him to come in for a drink and a snack. He said: “Sir, these places are not for us. They may allow me in today as your guest, but tomorrow is a different day.” My eyes were moist. With difficulty I held back my tears, offered a tip, which was rejected, and then said goodbye.All these words, from the grandson of a slave, underline much of what is wrong in America even today, something that a black President could not fix in eight years. I relay this story often to migrant Indian communities when I am asked to speak at weddings, with the message for the youth that our distinct culture needs to be cherished and preserved for future generations. Surrender your culture and lose your soul. Integrate, but not at the expense of your identity.Protest happens not from opportunity but from need and grievance. As long as disparities remain, there will be protest. Inequity is the breeding ground for resentment that cannot be permanently contained. However, young and bright you may be in America, if you happen to be black you will get smacked. Sad, but true.The writer is a Ludhiana-based former Congress MLA||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/young-gifted-and-smacked-but-black-lives-matter/story-JYo06eJWrROwwUMjBisIXM.html

Any violation will be viewed seriously and departmental proceedings will be taken against the offenders,” he said.Schools and colleges had created WhatsApp groups to facilitate online studies as the institutions are closed since March due to the Covid-19 pandemic. However, some obscene material was posted in these groups which have parents and teachers as members.The government has announced vacations in educational institutions till June 30 which may be extended till July if the situation does not improve.There are 10,714 primary schools in the state with 23,909 teachers; 1,996 middle schools with 6,614 teachers; and 2,749 high schools with 36,288 teachers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/himachal-to-act-against-members-posting-irrelevant-obscene-content-in-online-study-groups/story-vbsstbg1cn59TMBnrAtNkJ.html

10-06-2020||Delhi||Man who pointed gun at cop part of Delhi riots conspiracy: Police charge sheet||The Delhi Police on Tuesday filed three charge sheets in connection with the violence in February which singed the North-East district.The police have named Shahrukh Pathan, the man whose video of pointing a pistol at a policeman during the riots had gone viral on the Internet, in two cases. Pathan has been charged with rioting and under relevant sections for pointing a gun at head constable Deepak Dahiya during the riots on February 24.Both the incidents had taken place at the Jafarabad-Maujpur Chowk, but separate cases were registered and Pathan was booked and arrested.Pathan was arrested from Uttar Pradesh in March. He is a resident of Karawal Nagar in North-East Delhi.The police have said in the charge sheet that on February 24 around 11 am, two groups - one supporting and the other opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizen (NRC) - clashed at Maujpur Chowk.“...incidents of stone-pelting, brick batting, arson, firing and sabotage from both sides led to injuries to several police personnel as well as public persons and created an atmosphere of fear among public...,” the police have mentioned in the charge sheet.Eyewitnesses had said that Pathan emerged from the crowd of the groups protesting against the CAA. The police allege that he fired at constable Dahiya.Reacting to the allegations made in the charge sheet, Pathan’s lawyer, Asghar Khan, said that his client is being falsely charged. He said that in the first case, the complainant, (head constable Deepak Dahiya)’s statement in the first information report (FIR) about opening fire is contrary to an interview he gave to a TV channel after the incident.“My client is being falsely charged in the case. The complainant told a TV channel that my client did not fire. However, in the FIR he has said that he had to duck to save himself from the bullet. The charge of attempt to murder (307 of IPC) is also false as Pathan opened fire in self-defence and not to injure or kill anyone,” Khan said.The other two cases in which charge sheets were filed on Tuesday were for the deaths of two persons during the communal violence in Kardampuri neighbourhood on February 24 and 25. Eight people - four in each case - were arrested and charged with murder, rioting, criminal conspiracy and other offences.A total of 88 charge sheets have filed by Delhi Police in different cases related to the North-East Delhi riots so far, including three against suspended AAP MLA Tahir Husain (one of which accuses him of planning the murder of IB staffer Ankit Sharma), one against six persons for the death of 85-year-old Akbari Begum, against Pinjra Tod activists Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, one against Khalid Saifi of United Against Hate, one against 17 persons for the death of head constable Rattan Lal, and one against 12 persons for the death of Dilbar Negi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/shahrukh-pathan-part-of-delhi-riots-conspiracy-police-say-in-charge-sheet/story-YTbQzlqpHxhXl5FnPxBYLO.html

But the hospital refused to treat him as his temperature was above normal,” said neighbour Tarun Chakraborty. They took them to the Calcutta Medical College and Hospital where the doctors said his temperature was normal and so, referred him to a non-Covid hospital. The ambulance then took them to a non-Covid hospital which sent them away as it didn’t have spare beds. A senior doctor with the Calcutta Medical College Hospital’s administration said: “If a patient comes without any symptoms, why should we admit him here?

10-06-2020||Mumbai||4.19 lakh passengers travelled by BEST bus on Day 1 of Mission Begin Again||Four lakh nineteen thousand passengers commuted on buses run by the Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) undertaking on Monday, Day 1 of Mission Begin Again, when the bus services resumed after the lockdown. BEST earned ₹40.44 lakh from ticket sales on Monday. Only 30 passengers, including five standing, are allowed on a bus.BEST operated an additional 176 buses on Tuesday. Altogether, around 2308 buses plied on 81 routes in the city. However, long queues at bus stands were reported on Tuesday along with violations of distancing norms.“I had to wait for half an hour to get a bus. There were long queues and there were people waiting for one hour. Frequency of buses should be increased.” said Abhijeet Bhosale, a Ghatkopar resident whose office is in Vikhroli. The administration plans to operate additional buses. However, of the 4,335 conductors and 4,126 bus drivers expected to report for duty, only 1,992 conductors and 2,024 bus drivers turned up on Monday.BEST Sanyukt Kamgar Kruti Samiti (BSKKS), an umbrella body of BEST unions, has said silent protests will be held June 11 onwards outside bus depots in the city because employees have faced disciplinary actions and charge sheets (issued by BEST administration). “The administration is issuing charge sheets to its own employees without considering or understanding the situation. Few employees are residing in containment zones and others do not have proper means of transport to reach their workplace. We will begin a silent protest from June 11 outside every bus depot in the city,” said Shashank Rao, president, BSKKS. The union has also asked the administration to make a temporary hospital for Covid-positive employees at Wadala bus depot or Dindoshi traffic training centre. Citizen group Mumbai Mobility Forum (MMF) has written to BEST administration with suggestions to reduce overcrowding.“We can have two shifts for all offices including [those in] Mantralaya, Bandra Kurla Complex, Nariman Point and Ballard Estate. This will reduce crowding. A simple solution is by putting school buses in action along with a return trip in the morning to cater to commuters. We can run one makeshift bus lane with paint. It has worked in Bengaluru,” said Ashok Datar of MMF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/4-19-lakh-passengers-travelled-by-best-bus-on-day-1-of-mission-begin-again/story-csrm3rIxvXTiuYcy9vL8qI.html

The plea seeks urgent directions for protecting the life and health of the students who are to appear for the exams that were postponed since March, owing to the Covid-19 outbreak and rescheduled for July.The exams for Class 10 students were rescheduled from July 2 to 12, while those for Class 12 were rescheduled from July 1 to 14.In light of the Covid-19 pandemic, the plea moved by advocate Arvind Raghunath on behalf of the ICSE student’s parent sought directions to the authorities to cancel the rescheduled exam time table and declare results on the basis of gradation and assessment of past performances. The plea also sought directions from the court to CISCE for issuing results of Class 10 students on time to enable them to seek admissions to first-year junior colleges (FYJCs) through an online admission process initiated by the state education department. The plea also prayed for restraint on the state authorities from starting online admissions for FYJC till all the boards declare results for Class 10.Pointing to the compromise on the health and safety of students if exams were to be conducted in July, the petition says, “In present situation conducting examinations is very difficult. Decision of the respondents severely violates fundamental rights provided under the constitution. While all students had to endure the trauma of lockdown measures and potent threat to health and life, the students of respective state boards and universities were protected by the authorities from exams and students of ICSE board are facing strong discrimination and have been exposed to the threat and fear of getting probably infected by moving out for exams.”The petition further states that as students, teachers and school staff would be required to travel to the school for the exams, if any of them were to be infected by the virus who would be held responsible for it. “In present pandemic situation, if anything happens to students, teachers and staff or police personnel, then who shall take responsibility,” said the plea.On Tuesday, a bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice S S Shinde was to hear the petition however due to paucity of time, it is likely to be heard on Friday, June 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/parent-files-plea-in-bombay-hc-seeking-cancellation-of-icse-isc-exams-in-july/story-GT0aLO96W4ztLPi9OoRcOI.html

10-06-2020||Mumbai||Architecture students oppose plan to hold exams online||Days after the Council of Architecture (CoA) requested the Maharashtra government to allow architecture colleges to conduct final-year examinations online, students have raised objections with the state education department on the decision. Many Bachelor of Architecture (BArch) students are worried that conducting exams online will not be possible, especially for students in rural Maharashtra. Additionally, any further delay in the process means a delay in receiving course certificates, which could harm their prospects.“BArch is a five-year course and students have already cleared nine semesters as well as the internals for the current semester. CoA’s insistence on the written exam is baseless,” said a student, requesting anonymity.While chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced on May 31 that all final-year undergraduate and postgraduate students will be promoted based on their performance in previous semesters, the state government received a letter from CoA to exempt final-year architecture students from the same.In the letter, CoA has highlighted how in the current semester (final year), the council can’t ignore thesis-related exams and activities for students. “BArch is distinct from other courses as the full semester is devoted to thesis and assessment/juries/exams occurring in the final year. This forms a critical part of the course, in shaping and evaluating the performance, creativity, and design skills of the students,” stated the letter.Students, however, have now approached the state government, to ask that the exams not be held online because many students belong to rural Maharashtra, there are insufficient or no internet facilities in place. “What’s worse is that the delay is also affecting our prospects, including higher education and jobs. We request the government to promote all students based on their previous semester performance and provide us with course passing certificates,” said another student.While director of the Directorate of Technical Education (DTE) was not reachable, a senior official from the department said they are waiting to hear from the state government before taking a decision on final-year exams.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/architecture-students-oppose-plan-to-hold-exams-online/story-9Se3o7s7emkppBrpHOAVEI.html
10-06-2020||Mumbai||Scrap fee hike or face action, Maharashtra education department tells schools||After being flooded with complaints from parents about schools imposing fee hikes during the ongoing Covid-19 crisis, the education department has asked its officers to issue a final warning to such educational institutions before they are served notices next week.Bhaskarrao Babar, assistant director, Mumbai region, said that private schools are being asked to scrap their fee hike immediately or face action. “Our officers are calling schools about which were have received complaints. They are being asked to adhere to the government norms and scrap their announced fee hike. If we do not get a satisfactory response, they will be issued notices starting Monday,” said Babar.As per a government resolution (GR) released in the first week of May, schools cannot hike fees for the academic year 2020-21 and have to allow parents to pay fees in installments. On May 29, the state education department released a list of nodal officers who would hear complaints related to fee hikes. “The officers are calling respective schools because, with the current situation, everyone is working from home. Parents are asked not to pay hiked fees. If schools don’t fall in line, action will be taken,” said Babar. Parents have been complaining that since schools have not given them much time to pay the hiked fees, they are finding it difficult to wait for government action. “We have registered a complaint with the nodal officers but since there is no response yet, we are worried that the school might not allow our children to attend online classes. We hope that the department acts swiftly so that parents don’t have to live in anxiety,” said the parent of a student at a suburban school which hiked its fees by 15%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/scrap-fee-hike-or-face-action-maharashtra-education-department-tells-schools/story-4jx9G2IO3XIbtQcyJhMqwJ.html

The residents have come under the banner of the NGO, Samaj Sewa Society, to accomplish the task.Residents said water-sewer pipelines were laid in their area around three years ago, but the panchayat failed to reconstruct the street, which was dug up for the purpose, since then. Due to this, accidents take place on the potholed street and students have to move through mud on their way to schools during the monsoon season.Leading residents, Sanjay Tiwari said, “The panchayat has been delaying the project due to which around two dozen families living in the street have decided to take up the work by themselves. We want to construct the street before monsoon hits the city. Before starting the project, we also got a resolution approved from the panchayat. The work was commenced on Tuesday and it is expected the work will be completed by June-end.”Another resident, Raghubir Singh, said, “A pacca road was never developed in the area since the time this area was developed around 18 years ago and only sand was poured in the street, which is a portion of the road. Due toinstallation of water-sewer lines, potholes had developed. but the panchayat paid no heed to the problem, despite several complaints. Even now the panchayat members were making excuses due to which the residents decided to take up the project by themselves.”Congress sarpanch, Kiran Mohan, however, refuted the allegations and said a few residents are trying to get political mileage out of the situation.He said, “The panchayat is already constructing two streets in the same locality and residents of street number 2 were asked to wait for their turn. But, the residents demanded that their street should be constructed before monsoon. After residents approached the panchayat with their plan to construct the street, the panchayat approved a resolution for the same.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/irked-over-delay-sbs-nagar-residents-start-construction-of-street-on-their-own/story-uEMr1XLKyXir8mFSVXsHZL.html
10-06-2020||Mumbai||3 Mumbai wards see daily Covid case growth of over 5%: BMC’s data||In a concern for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), the daily Covid-19 growth rate in three wards in the western suburbs covering areas namely Malad, Kandivli, Borivli and Dahisar is above five per cent, much higher than the rest of the areas where the growth rate is 1-4%, data shows. The overall average growth rate of Covid-19 cases in the city has dipped to 2.93%.The three wards are P-N (Malad), R-S (Kandivli), R-N (Dahisar, Borivli), with P-N topping the list at 6.1 per cent, followed by R-N at 5.5% and R-S at 5.3%, as of BMC’s data for June 8. The three account for more than 4,000 cases.Other areas namely Dharavi, Worli, Mankhurd, Chembur, Bandra-East, Kurla, Byculla and Malabar Hill that saw a high number of cases are seeing 1-4% growth in Covid-19 cases. The growth rate is the lowest (1.5%) in areas such as Byculla, Mazgaon, Matunga, Wadala and parts of Dadar.According to BMC officials, the growth rate in these three wards is high, considering cases are coming from those pockets where there were no cases. A BMC official said, “The recovery rate of the three wards is also between 25 and 33 per cent, which indicates that the cases have increased in the past few days.”In P-N ward, the recovery rate is 27%, 32% in R-S ward and 26% in R-N ward. Sanjay Kurhade, assistant municipal commissioner of R-S Ward that covers Kandivli, said, “The universal strategy is to trace, quarantine and test more focused suspects, so our focus is on slums. The growth rate is high because these are pockets where there were no cases earlier. The downfall has started in a few slum pockets, but new pockets are emerging which is contributing to the increased growth rate. Our focus is currently on areas like Poisar and Hanuman Nagar where cases are beginning to be reported.” Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a Mumbai-based health consultant with a private hospital, said, “The growth rate is not much higher than other areas. However, with cases increasing, the growth rate will come down in these areas. BMC should also analyse and release the ward- or area-wise testing data. Then we can be in a better position to comment whether the rise or fall is rational.”Meanwhile, Mumbai saw 1,015 cases in a day on Tuesday, taking the count to 51,100. The city also saw 58 deaths, which brought the toll to 1,760. The number of recovered patients in the city stands at 22,943, followed by 26,391 active cases, according to the state health department data.According to BMC’s data, of the 3,12,778 senior citizens surveyed, it has referred 1,834 citizens for oxygen therapy. As of Tuesday, there are 775 active containment zones and 4,071 sealed buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/3-mumbai-wards-see-daily-covid-case-growth-of-over-5-bmc-s-data/story-uT0zBKYYelZYAzIbTa97kJ.html
10-06-2020||Mumbai||Body of 62-year-old who was admitted to Covid facility in Mumbai handed over to family without test||The body of a 62-year-old suspected Covid-19 victim was handed over to her kin by the civic-run Sion Hospital without confirming if the woman was infected, putting the family at risk of contracting the novel coronavirus. Medical health experts called it a case of “gross negligence” on part of the hospital, which has 400 beds for Covid-19 patients. Gyanti Devi was first admitted to the Bandra-Kurla Complex’s (BKC) makeshift Covid care facility at 5am on June 2 with breathing issues and lower body pain, after the family was turned away from Shatabdi Hospital in Kandivli and Cooper Hospital in Andheri owing to unavailability of beds. The same afternoon, as many as 200 patients were moved from the BKC centre to the Covid care facility at NSCI Exhibition Centre in Worli and Sion Hospital due to the threat of Cyclone Nisarga. Gyanti Devi was taken to Sion Hospital, where she succumbed on June 3, and her body was handed over to her family the next day. Her death certificate, a copy of which is with Hindustan Times, states that she died of type-two respiratory failure, lower respiratory tract infection, hypertension and chronic kidney disease. Respiratory failure coupled with comorbidities is one of the major causes of deaths in Covid-19 patients. However, there was no Covid test conducted on Gyanti Devi. When asked about Gyanti Devi’s case, Ramesh Bharmal, dean of Sion Hospital, said she was supposed to get tested at the BKC facility. “We thought the patient was already tested. She was admitted in a semi-coma state and had several comorbidities. She was treated as a non-Covid patient,” said Bharmal, adding that after her death, “we asked if she was tested, but we didn’t get any information if the swab samples were taken or not”. On June 8, when Gyanti Devi’s grandson, Sandeep Sharma, received all her medical reports from Sion Hospital, he said the deputy dean told him that a test may not have been conducted. “The doctor told me that looking at the treatment documents, it looks like the patient was not tested for Covid-19,” said Sharma.However, a Sion Hospital staff, on condition of anonymity, said Gyanti Devi’s swab samples could have been misplaced. “The swabs may have gone missing as there is no report about them,” he said. Health and medico-legal experts, however, said a Covid test should have been conducted on Gyanti Devi. “If patient is kept at a Covid facility and if she is suspected to have Covid, a test needs to be conducted. If a test is not necessary, why was the patient kept at a Covid facility then?” said Dr Wiqar Shaikh, a senior allergy and asthma specialist. “The death certificate says the patient died of respiratory failure and lower respiratory tract infection. In that case, a Covid test was mandatory.”Noted criminal lawyer Sudeep Pasbola said the standard operating procedure says that a Covid-19 test needs to be conducted in such cases otherwise “they [hospital] are liable for negligence”. “Even if a person dies of heart attack at home, you cannot cremate the body as it is sent for post-mortem and a Covid-19 test is done. If the test result is positive, the body is wrapped and the relatives are called to directly take it to the crematorium with all precautions in place,” said Pasbola. When HT contacted Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner (health), he said, “I will look into the matter.”THE 48-HOUR CHAOSFor Gyanti Devi’s family, finding out that she had died and locating her body was also a horrifying experience. Her grandson had to run from pillar to post for 48 hours to locate Gyanti Devi, after she was moved from the BKC facility.The family claim they did not receive any intimation from the BKC facility about transferring Gyanti Devi even though they had submitted their contact details. “We were not even informed that my grandmother had been shifted and we waited outside BKC facility for eight hours as no one was allowed us to enter inside,” said Sharma. “After we pressured the security guard, we were let in, but could not find her. The staff at the facility had no clue where she had been sent. I was just told that several patients were shifted to Worli NSCI and Sion Hospital.”Sharma and his family then did the rounds of Worli NSCI and Sion Hospital for two days, but could not find Gyanti Devi at both places. “We could not even find her name in the list of patients that were moved from BKC,” said Sharma. Finally, on the evening of June 4, while enquiring with the Sion Hospital staff, the family was told that there was an unclaimed body of a woman who had died on June 3. “We searched in all wards at Sion Hospital and went to the enquiry counter multiple times. The staff then suspected that she could have died and they contacted the Sion crematorium. They then found out that an unclaimed body had been sent to the cremation. It was my grandmother,” said Sharma. After Sharma reach the crematorium, the body was handed over to him, but the family still does not know if Gyanti Devi was Covid-19.BJP corporator Vinod Mishra called the case “a huge blunder by the health staff at both the facilities”. “The details of the patient were not shared properly because of which it led to so much trouble for the family. We are going to legally challenge this matter in court,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/body-of-62-year-old-who-was-admitted-to-covid-facility-in-mumbai-handed-over-to-family-without-test/story-F20gVQjMKAJrNCt2AD80bO.html

10-06-2020||Mumbai||HC asks Centre to consider price cap on N95 masks||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Union of India to inform it of its proposal to cap pricing of N95 face masks after it was informed that the National Pharmaceutical Pricing Authority (NPPA), the government regulatory agency that controls prices of pharmaceutical drugs in the country, had failed to keep the price of the masks under check. The court was told that NPPA’s failure had resulted in widespread exploitation by manufacturers and traders who inflated the price of masks due to the heavy demand in light of the Covid-19 outbreak.A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice SS Shinde, while hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by activists Anjali Damania and Sucheta Dalal, was informed that the price of N95 masks had skyrocketed after they were included under the Essential Commodity’s Act. The activists further informed the court that while NPPA had capped the price of other products like hand sanitisers, it had failed to do the same for masks.The court was informed that after the public protested against the high cost of N95 masks, the NPPA in a meeting convened on May 15 had said that it had asked manufacturers to voluntarily reduce the price of the mask in light of the pandemic, which they agreed to do. The activists added that though the Drug Price Control Act stipulates that prices could only be increased by 10% annually, the reduced price was still higher than the price it was being sold at before the lockdown and hence, sought directions to put a cap on the same.After the court expressed displeasure at the uncontrolled rise in the prices of N95 masks, additional solicitor general Anil Singh, appearing for the Union of India and NPPA, sought time to take instructions and said that the authorities would consider capping the mask prices, which the court allowed and posted the matter for further hearing on June 12.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/hc-asks-centre-to-consider-price-cap-on-n95-masks/story-PNbBI1oNc4mpA9JmRQpGtM.html

The shops can remain open from Monday to Saturday and need to be closed on Sunday. However, the condition that shops on either side of the road can open on alternate days is still in effect. In the circular issued by BMC chief Iqbal Chahal on Tuesday morning, BMC has also made it clear that while outdoor physical activities are allowed, use of garden equipment such as open air gyms or swings for children will not be allowed. The circular has also ruled that staff of educational institutions and universities can operate only for non-teaching purposes, including evaluation of answer sheets and declaration of results.A BMC official said, “The relaxations for operating hours of shops have been changed to full working day, however, the night curfew rule from 9pm to 5am shall remain. Shopkeepers are free to keep shops open, considering their full working day schedule, excluding the night curfew hours. With the commissioner’s order, all 24 wards will now have to issue revised orders.”Meanwhile, all shops and citizens are expected to follow social distancing norms and take safety precautions such as wearing masks.

10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh vendors struggle to stay afloat due to dearth of customers||There seems to be no end to the woes of the city vendors, who were still trying to find a footing in their newly allotted vending zones when the coronavirus-induced lockdown dealt a crippling blow to their business. Though the administration had allowed the vendors to resume operations on odd-even basis from May 19, low footfall, due to the fear of the spread of the virus, has led to losses for the vendors. A majority of the vendors are not even opening their stalls due to dearth of customers. In Sector-15, where 936 vending sites were allotted, less than a 100 vendors have been turning up and most have moved away from the designated spot, where earlier the apni mandi used to be held, and settled in the greenbelt next to the vending zone. Sudesh, a vendor selling candies and powdered herbs, says that even residents living nearby avoid the market. “People are scared of visiting places such as the vending zone. I have been setting up my vend here ever since we were allowed to resume business in May, but I’m losing more money than I make,” he said. Deepak, another vendor who used to sell momos before the lockdown, has now switched to rajma chawal, with his customers mostly being other vendors. Deepak had been relocated here from Sector 19 during the municipal corporation’s eviction drive. “Our sales had already taken a big hit after we were shifted here in January but now the Covid-19 outbreak has completely destroyed our business. It is now difficult even to make ends meet.”In Sector 41, where 112 sites were demarcated, only a few vendors can be seen selling clothes and fruits these days. Kushal, who sells clothes, here said, “We don’t need to follow the odd-even rule here as only a few vendors show up. We keep empty spaces between each stall to ensure social distancing.” Madan Lal Sharma, who prepares tea at one of the stalls here, said that before lockdown, he would use about 10 litres of milk everyday, now he couldn’t finish even 1 litre of milk as nobody comes to his stall anymore.Sector 48 has 105 spaces demarcated for vendors, but only one vendor turned up here on Tuesday. Deepak who sells juice, said that all other vendors had left for their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar on the Shramik Trains. “I had to open my stall as my rent is due and my landlord in Sector 45 is threatening to evict me. If I don’t get customers and more stalls don’t open up here, I’ll shut my stall and look for other ways to earn money, “ he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-vendors-struggle-to-stay-afloat-due-to-dearth-of-customers/story-cGi3tv4pCV1kgjepT9CLhK.html

10-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi riots: Cops file three new charge sheets||The Delhi Police on Tuesday filed three charge sheets in a Delhi court in three separate cases related to the north-east Delhi communal riots that claimed the lives of 53 people and left more than 400 others injured in February this year.In one of the three cases, the police have arrested and charge-sheeted five persons, including Shahrukh Pathan, the man whose video of pointing a pistol at a policeman during the riots had gone viral on the Internet. Being the prime accused, Pathan has already been arrested and charge-sheeted for allegedly brandishing the gun and firing at head constable Deepak Dahiya, senior crime branch officers privy to the case said.Both the incidents had taken place at the Jafarabad-Maujpur Chowk at the same time in February, but separate cases were registered and Pathan was booked and arrested for two of them.In the second case, Pathan and four others have been charged with rioting, attempt to murder, assaulting government officials, and criminal conspiracy. The charge sheet, in this case, was filed before a duty magistrate in a city court on Tuesday.The police have said in the charge sheet that on February 24 around 11 am, two groups—one supporting and the other opposing the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the National Register of Citizen (NRC)—clashed at Maujpur Chowk.“...incidents of stone-pelting, brick batting, arson, firing and sabotage from both sides led to injuries to several police personnel as well as public persons and created an atmosphere of fear among public...,” the police have mentioned in the charge sheet.One man, Vinod (identified by his first name) lost his life in the incident but a separate case was registered in connection with his murder, an investigator, who did not want to be named, said.Reacting to the allegations made in the charge sheet, Pathan’s lawyer, Asghar Khan, said that his client is being falsely charged. He said that in the first case, the complainant, (head constable Deepak Dahiya)’s statement in the first information report (FIR) about opening fire is contrary to an interview he gave to a TV channel after the incident. “My client is being falsely charged in the case. The complainant told a TV channel that my client did not fire. However, in the FIR he has said that he had to duck to save himself from the bullet. The charge of attempt to murder (307 of IPC) is also false as Pathan opened fire in self-defence and not to injure or kill anyone,” Khan said. The other two cases in which charge sheets were filed on Tuesday were for the deaths of two persons during the communal violence in Kardampuri neighbourhood on February 24 and 25. Eight people—four in each case—were arrested and charged with murder, rioting, criminal conspiracy and other offences.The police said that on February 24, one Mohammad Furkan was shot dead during the communal riots at the Kardampuri puliya (culvert). Four persons have been charge-sheeted in the case.On February 25, a 32-year-old e-rickshaw driver, Deepak, was caught and lynched by the mob near a government dispensary in Kardampuri where communal violence broke out. Four persons have been arrested and charged with rioting and killing Deepak, the police said in their third charge sheet.The police on Tuesday maintained that during their investigation in the three cases, “it has emerged that there was a deep-rooted conspiracy which triggered the communal riot.”“...the conspirators caused disruption by the dual scheme of spreading misinformation on the CAA and causing chakka jam on main arterial roads, which triggered a major communal riot,” the police said in a statement.A total of 88 charge sheets have filed by Delhi Police in different cases related to the north-east Delhi riots so far, including three against suspended AAP MLA Tahir Husain (one of which accuses him of planning the murder of IB staffer Ankit Sharma), one against six persons for the death of 85-year-old Akbari Begum, against Pinjra Tod activists Devangana Kalita and Natasha Narwal, one against Khalid Saifi of United Against Hate, one against 17 persons for the death of head constable Rattan Lal, and one against 12 persons for the death of Dilbar Negi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-riots-cops-file-three-new-charge-sheets/story-9wxpiWPthlaM5U7jzkpmpI.html
10-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab Engineering College study suggests ways to decongest Nayagaon||Punjab Engineering College (PEC) has come up with a case study that can help decongest Nayagaon, which is located on the outskirts of Chandigarh.The study which suggests ways to decongest the area has been carried out by faculty member Har Amrit Singh Sandhu and other two students of the civil engineering department. Over the years, traffic congestion has increased rapidly in Nayagaon due to increase in population and absence of good roads.According to the study, the traffic from Vidya Path, which is a four-lane road, gets merged into a two-lane Khuda Ali Sher road. Vidhya Path, having an approximate width of about 16m, narrows down to a mere 4m road, leading to severe congestion in Nayagaon, as per the study.Also, street vendors occupying the carriageway increase congestion. The lack of proper drainage facilities in Nayagaon leads to flooding during rainfall.Due to this, the unpaved shoulders become muddy and pedestrians and cyclists are forced to use the road.SUGGESTIONS OF THE STUDYThe study has suggested many ways to decongest the Nayagaon including increasing the carriageway width by providing paved shoulders so that there is additional space for vehicles to move and jams would reduce considerably. A proper median should be provided after providing paved shoulders. The median would ensure that the vehicles do not change respective lanes.Also, traffic lights should be provided at the two intersections to reduce jams and mishaps.Moreover, the study also suggests that a proper auto-rickshaw stand should be made for the boarding and de-boarding of passengers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-engineering-college-study-suggests-ways-to-decongest-nayagaon/story-jVyJGpy5Twwhr5Puz35EyL.html
10-06-2020||Delhi||L-G decision to keep beds open to all puts Delhi residents at disadvantage, say expert panel members||The lieutenant-governor’s decision to make available beds in Delhi hospitals to those living in NCR and other states will be detrimental to the residents of the city, said two of the members of a panel constituted by the government to aid the government in augmenting the city’s health care infrastructure.Delhi will need 80,000 beds by the end of July to treat patients with the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia told a meeting of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday, quoting the figures projected in a report prepared by the five-member expert panel, set up on June 2.“We presented the data to predict that by June 15, there will be 44,000 Covid-19 cases in the national capital and 6,600 beds will be required. By June 30, we’ll reach one lakh cases and 15,000 beds will be required. By July 15, there will be 2.25 lakh cases and 33,000 beds will be required. By July 31, the number of cases will touch 5.5 lakh and 80,000 beds will be required,” Sisodia said.With only those with severe infection being admitted to hospitals, the committee in its report said most of these beds have to be a level 3 or 4-- meaning they have to be equipped with high-flow oxygen and/or ventilators, the chairperson of the committee Dr Mahesh Verma had earlier told HT after submitting the report.Cumulatively, there are currently just 57, 709 beds in government and private hospitals across the city, according to the latest Economic Survey of Delhi. To combat the shortage of beds, the committee had suggested converting banquet halls, dharmashalas, and even open stadiums into makeshift hospitals.“The committee has said Delhi will need 40,000 beds by mid-July. These calculations are based solely on Delhi’s population and the number of cases being reported from the city every day. Now, if these facilities were to be utilised by people from neighbouring states, the government will need to arrange thousands more beds over and above the projected requirement,” Dr RK Gupta, a member of the committee and former president of the Delhi Medical Association, said.A second member of the committee said the state government was not in the wrong to restrict services in its own hospitals as health is a state subject.“Health is a state subject and the government utilises the tax payers’ money on health care services. So a government’s primary responsibility is to the people of Delhi. The Delhi government order only kept aside Delhi government-run hospitals and some private hospitals for its residents; people from neighbouring states could still go to central government-run hospitals, hospitals run by civic bodies, or the super speciality private hospitals. Now, Delhi residents will be at a disadvantage,” Dr Arun Gupta, a member of the committee and president of the Delhi Medical Council, said.Currently, there are 8,872 isolation beds for the treatment of Covid-19 patients in the city. Of these, 5,711 are in nine government hospitals and the other 3,161 across 91 private hospitals. The highest number of free beds currently available in the city are in Delhi government-run 2,000-bed Lok Nayak hospital and 1,500-bed Guru Teg Bahadur hospital.“The Delhi government is planning to link hotels and dharamshalas to various government hospitals so that if anyone’s condition deteriorates they can be immediately shifted to these hospitals. The government would be providing the consumables but members of the Delhi Medical Association would like to provide manpower for these hotel clusters. We have already had a meeting with health minister Satyendar Jain and the details are being worked out,” Dr Girish Tyagi, president of the Delhi Medical Association, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/l-g-decision-to-keep-beds-open-to-all-puts-delhi-residents-at-disadvantage-say-expert-panel-members/story-atcWdYNErT3iz5oJXMunDK.html
10-06-2020||Delhi||Private labs earlier banned by Delhi govt resume Covid-19 tests||Seven of eight laboratories that were barred from conducting further Covid-19 confirmation tests by the Delhi government , started collecting samples once again on Tuesday after lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal reversed the state’s restrictive testing policy.`With this, Delhi’s capacity for testing has increased by about 8,000 tests a day. The laboratories that resumed sample collection are Dr Lal Pathlabs; City X-Ray and Scan Clinic; Prognosis Laboratory; SRL Reference Laboratory; Star Imaging Path Laboratory; Pathkind Labs; and the National Centre for Disease Control. The eight one, the laboratory at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, is yet to get a nod from the government to resume sample collection.The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), the country’s apex health research body, has approved 16 government and 22 private laboratories in Delhi for Covid-19 testing.The number of Covid-19 tests in the national capital, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government, fell to 3,700 on Monday, the lowest since the first week of May.On average, 6,129 samples were being tested during the week ending May 31, which came down to an average of 5,590 tests a day during the week ending June 7, data from the daily health bulletin shows. The Delhi government on June 5 served show-cause notices to seven laboratories for testing asymptomatic patients “without following ICMR testing protocols”. Later, an inquiry was initiated against the labs and the access granted to phlebotomists (those who collect the swab samples) to the RT-PCR testing app was blocked. No laboratory across the country is allowed to collect Covid-19 test samples without logging into the app and filling in required details of patients.These laboratories received their log in rights back on Monday and Tuesday. The government stopped registrations of phlebotomists from Dr Lal Pathlabs in early May, after an inquiry was initiated against the laboratory over discrepancies in data. Dr Lal Pathlabs is the largest privately owned chain of laboratories in the country and has the highest testing capacity in the city, about 4,000 RT-PCR samples a day.After resuming sample collection at his labs on Tuesday, Dr Arvind Lal, chairman of Dr Lal Pathlabs, said,“The Delhi government has given us a green signal to go ahead with testing; we have begun collecting samples.” Still, labs are now confused as to who they are supposed to test. “The labs are caught in a tussle between the centre and state. We got into trouble for testing asymptomatic individuals – as per ICMR guideline or when a doctor recommended it before a surgery or procedure. Now, we will try and avoid testing asymptomatic individuals to prevent any future confusion,” said the owner of one of the private laboratories, on condition of anonymity.The lone laboratory that is yet to get a go-ahead from the government to resume testing is the one at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital. The government, on June 5, filed an FIR against the laboratory for not using the RT-PCR app. The hospital, till then, was testing about 300 to 400 samples a day.A senior Delhi government official said on condition of anonymity that labs such as Dr Lal Pathlabs and City X-Ray and Scan Clinic were issued show-cause notices for not registering with the city administration’s RT-PCR app. “Now they (Dr Lal Pathlabs and City X-Ray and Scan) have duly applied for registration and have also given the names of their phlebotomists to be registered with us for sample collection. Accordingly, we have asked all 11 district administrations these phlebotomists in their lists,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/private-labs-earlier-banned-by-delhi-govt-back-to-collecting-samples-for-testing/story-ClodCAeXyoPlBlaNUDas7L.html
10-06-2020||Delhi||Reopening schools, Metro discussed in L-G’s all-party meet||Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Tuesday held an all-party meeting to discuss and review the Capital’s preparedness to contain the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The meeting was attended by members of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), and the Congress among other political leaders. Members of Opposition parties present in the meeting said their views were sought on reopening schools and Metro services in the city.The L-G’s office tweeted, “Held all-party meeting to discuss the present situation of Covid-19 in Delhi & measures to contain its spread. Discussed issues relating to availability of beds for Covid-19 patients, extensive testing, swift ambulance response, providing critical information in public domain, etc.”In the meeting, which lasted for an hour-and-a-half, BJP and Congress members expressed reservations over opening schools and resuming Metro services given the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the city.“While schools are closed anyway right now, I advised against restarting Metro services in the city as the number of Covid-19 cases are increasing every day,” Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said. Metro services in the city have been shut since March 22, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi had called for a nationwide Janta Curfew. While the Centre and the Delhi government have allowed the restart of public transport services in the Capital, Delhi Metro is yet to resume operations. The Delhi government also allowed malls and restaurants to open from June 8, but the views of Opposition parties were sought if they should remain open.Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhary said he requested the L-G to direct the Delhi government to do away with fixed electricity charges if they plan to shut malls and restaurants.“I have requested that the fixed charges on electricity shouldn’t be charged during the lockdown period. And if the government plans to close malls and restaurants, then it should do away with their fixed electricity charges till they remain closed,” Chaudhary said.After the meeting, senior AAP leader and Rajya Sabha MP Sanjay Singh told reporters that the L-G had no answer to his question regarding the basis on which he overruled the Delhi government’s decision to reserve beds for Delhi residents. He alleged the BJP has pressured the L-G to take this decision.Singh said, “The (Delhi government’s) decision to reserve beds for residents of Delhi was taken based on the Mahesh Verma committee’s report, which stated that more beds will be required in the days to come. When I asked the L-G whether he had any survey or information about how the requirement for hospital beds would be met in the days to come, he had no answer. This shows that the governments of Manohar Lal Khattar (Haryana chief minister) and Yogi Adityanath (Uttar Pradesh chief minister) have failed completely in upgrading their healthcare infrastructure. Covid-19 cases are on the rise in Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram, which is why the BJP has pressured the L-G to take such a decision.”Gupta said, “They are unnecessarily politicising the issue. The Delhi government should first check its own health infrastructure. People are complaining about unavailability of beds in hospitals, testing facility and a lack of information.” The opposition parties raised issues of a fall in the number of Covid-19 tests, the alleged unavailability of hospital beds and overcharging by private hospitals.Gupta said he asked the L-G to cap the cost of Covid-19 treatment in private hospitals.The Congress, on the other hand, raised the issue of inconvenience faced by people in getting beds in government hospitals. “I have suggested that the number of beds available should be displayed outside and the government should test more people,” said Chaudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/reopening-schools-metro-discussed-in-l-g-s-all-party-meet/story-xkko0AiUvSsWsO6lc33mGI.html
10-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi govt readies health infra for further surge in Covid-19 cases||After a meeting with Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, held to review the Delhi government’s Covid-19 management strategies, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said that going by the coronavirus disease’s current doubling rate of 12.6 days in the Capital, the city would need around 80,000 hospital beds by July 31. Sisodia also said Delhi could expect to see 5.5 lakh Covid-19 cases by July 31. With the number of Covid-19 cases in the city set to cross the 30,000-mark, Baijal directed the Delhi government to start readying health infrastructure on a “war footing”. Documents seen by HT showed that as on Tuesday, the government had identified 2,950 additional beds, taking the number of Covid-19 beds in the city to at least 11,842 by June 20. But, the documents also revealed that the government had a stock of 12,000 viral transport mediums (VTMs) as on Tuesday — which will last “only for 10 days”.VTMs are equipment needed to collect and transport test samples. They are the kits that contain the transport media in a tube as well as the swab. “There is a shortage of VTMs across the country, Delhi cannot be blamed alone. One of the reasons why testing was being carried out in a restricted manner is also the shortage of VTMs. When there is a shortage of product, we have to rationalise its use,” said a senior government official, who asked to stay anonymous.Gauging the alarming shortage of VTMs, the Delhi government has now placed orders to get as many as 60,000 VTMs, which documents showed are expected to arrive by June 16.On June 2, the Delhi government had issued an order asking hospitals and testing labs to test only symptomatic people for Covid-19. This was overturned by the L-G on Monday, as he reasoned that keeping an asymptomatic person out of testing would adversely impact contact tracing and containment of infections in the city. Over the past one week, several hospitals have also stated that they are putting a cap on the number of Covid-19 tests being carried out on a daily basis due to a “shortage of resources”, though there was no official order from the government in this regard. As per documents presented before the L-G, and seen by HT, the state health department has projected the number of active cases in Delhi to touch 60,004 by June 30, 134,722 by July 15 and 319,237 by July 31. The bed requirement accordingly has been estimated at 15,001 (June 30), 33,680 (July 15) and 79,809 (July 31). The L-G was also informed that the government is in the process of ordering 20,000 new oxygen concentrators, a senior government official said. This will be in addition to the order of 2,000 oxygen concentrators that chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had announced last week. When asked if the city administration was prepared with the plan to arrange for 80,000 beds, a Delhi government spokesperson said, “That is what we highlighted to the L-G. If we allow patients from outside Delhi to get treated in our hospitals, no matter how many beds we arrange, it won’t be enough. From the government’s side, we are doing our best to make all arrangements.” The L-G’s office, in a statement after the meeting, said the government has constituted a committee under the chairmanship of divisional commissioner Sanjeev Khirwar to explore the possibility of accommodating for additional beds in the city, in spaces like stadiums.“The panel has, so far, suggested Pragati Maidan, Talkatora Indoor Stadium, Thyagaraj Indoor Stadium, Indira Gandhi Indoor stadium, Jawahar Lal Nehru Stadium, Dhyanchand National Stadium and so on to be used as make-shift hospitals,” the L-G office said. The fleet of CATS ambulance has been augmented from 160 to 450, which has reduced the response time to less than 30 minutes, a senior government official said.As on Tuesday, Delhi had 8,892 hospital beds, 582 ICU beds, 507 Ventilators beds and 3590 oxygenated-supported beds in Covid-designated hospitals. “Around 2,950 additional beds will be ready by June 20. This includes 450 beds in the new Delhi government hospital in Burari, which is expected to be operational by June 20. Another 500 beds have been earmarked in other government hospitals. In addition, district magistrates are linking 19 hospitals with hotels, which would tentatively increase the capacity by approximately 2,000 beds by June 15,” said a senior government official.So far, the health department has already linked eight four- and five-star hotels with some of the city’s major hospitals. The cost of beds in these hotels have been capped at Rs. 10,000 a day, including housekeeping, food and so on, apart from medical services, which are the responsibility of the linked hospital.The government has also posted IAS officers as ‘administrative officers’ in Covid hospitals to monitor their operations. On Sunday, the government had also ordered setting up of help desks, to be worked by government officers, in all government hospitals to facilitate the admission process. However, as on Tuesday, most Delhi government hospitals did not have these help desks. Hospitals such as Dr Hegdewar and Chacha Nehru Bal Chikitsalay said the respective officers deployed by the government had not reported there so far. As of Monday, Delhi had 29,943 Covid cases out of which 17,712 were active cases. As many as 874 people have died and 11,357 have recovered.The case fatality rate in Delhi is 2.92% as compared to the national average of 2.81% and the recovery rate is 38%. Delhi is conducting 13,543 tests per million as compared to the national average of 3531 tests per million, government reports showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-govt-readies-health-infra-for-further-surge-in-cases/story-6hGm91u4olgK1jzh2GNLKI.html
10-06-2020||Delhi||Nine of 10 students yet to pay April and May school fees in around 53% of 170 pvt schools in the city||Nine of 10 parents did not pay their children’s fees for the months of April in around 48% of 170 private schools in Delhi due to the economic slowdown triggered by a nationwide lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic, shows data collected by a committee of at least 400 unaided schools in the city. The proportion worsened in May, to 64 % of the schools. The data, from Action Aided Committee of Private Recognised and Unaided Schools, said that 82 of the 170 schools received the monthly fees — ranging from ₹1,100 to ₹5,500 — from 5-10% of the students in April, with the number going up to 108 schools in May.The enrolment in these schools ranges from 1,000-3,000 students. There are 1,175 private schools in the city.The situation in April in the other 47% of the schools wasn’t much better -- in 25% of the schools, only between 10% and 25% of children paid fees; and in 15% of the schools, between 25% and 50% of children; and 10% of schools , from between 50% and 75% of the children. Only 5 schools, around 3%, received fees from 75% to 100% of students. (The total exceeds 100% marginally because of rounding of)The fee collection dipped further in May, with not a single school receiving the fees from 75-100% students — 64% schools received fees from 5-10 % of the enrolled students, 20% from 10-25% students, 11% from 25-50% of the students and 6% schools receiving fees from 50-75% students.The majority of the schools said the parents cited dwindling savings, loss in business, salary cuts and an expectation that the government might waive off the fees as reasons for not paying the fees. On April 18, the Delhi government directed private schools to charge fees only under the tuition head during the Covid-19 lockdown. The schools were asked not to demand money under any other component and were warned of action under the Disaster Management Act if they failed to comply.Although schools were shut on March 19 in view of the lockdown, they continued virtual classes and sending online study material to their students till May 30, before announcing summer vacations. Officials said that if the government doesn’t allow physical reopening of schools, online classes will resume from the first week of July.Among the components the schools have not been charging amid the lockdown are the annual fee, which varies between ₹2,000 and ₹10,000 (charged yearly, half-yearly or quarterly), a monthly development fund, which ranges from 5-10% of the tuition fee, the monthly charges for smart classes (₹200 to ₹500) and transportation (₹600 to ₹2,000, depending on the location) . Schools said it will be difficult for them to pay their staff in June if more parents do not pay up.Sanjay Yadav, the principal of Ahlcon International School, said many parents have requested the administration for a fee relaxation during the lockdown. “Many parents sought some time for the payment of fees over the last two months, citing financial difficulties they are facing during the lockdown. Our fee collection was better in April. It reduced in May and we are now really sceptical about June. We have to pay our staff regularly, besides the payments to vendors and support staff. The school has already taken a loan and it’s expected that we will have to take additional loans if the collection remains the same in June,” he said.Tania Joshi, principal of the Indian School, said that some parents have promised to pay fees after the lockdown is lifted. “Parents will have to understand that the schools will have to pay the salaries of their staff as well. They are constantly working and teaching students online,” she said.Hari Prakash Sharma, the general secretary of Unaided RecognisedPrivate Schools Welfare Association, an umbrella body of 100 private schools in rural areas of Delhi, said many students had left for their home states. “Families of many of our students left for their villages and towns after losing jobs, which is why they have not paid the fees. A large section of students studying in these schools have parents working in factories, small-scale industries and wholesale markets across the city,” he said.Majority of the parents said they could not pay fees due to the financial crises triggered by the Covid-19 pandemic. Vishal Gupta, who runs a garment shop in Karol Bagh, said he has not earned anything in the last two months. Gupta’s daughter studies in class 5.Abhishek Singh, whose children are studying in classes 6 and 8 of a private school in west Delhi, said he has not been paid by his employer — a factory owner in Peeragarhi industrial area — since April. AK Bhattacharya, the president of Action Aided Committee of Private Recognised and Unaided Schools, said many schools have not been able to pay full salaries to their teachers amid the lockdown due to non-payment of fees by parents. “Many parents have genuine reasons and we are not forcing them to pay fees. But there are many who are taking advantage of the Delhi government’s April 18 order that had prohibited the schools from taking any action against students over non-payment of fees amid the lockdown. But now, we do not know for how long the lockdown will continue. How will the schools survive?” Bharat Arora, general secretary of the committee, said “It’s not just these 170 schools; the trend is the same in other schools as well. It’s going to be really difficult for the schools to pay salaries to the teachers for the month of June. Many parents have this misunderstanding that the government might waive the fee for the lockdown period.” Binay Bhushan, director, Directorate of Education (DoE), said the government cannot waive school fees. “There is no provision (for this).”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/nine-of-10-students-yet-to-pay-april-and-may-school-fees-in-around-53-of-170-pvt-schools-in-the-city/story-GQuyohvsu93vC4o5guOJmM.html
10-06-2020||Delhi||Provisional power bills to commercial users on fixed charges, taxes||The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission (DERC) has directed private distribution companies to issue provisional bills to non-domestic consumers only on the fixed charges and taxes, following complaints of inflated electricity bills. This means that industrial, commercial and other non-domestic connections will not be charged on the basis of their consumption or energy units. This, however, will be applicable only on those who are issued provisional bills. Before this order, these bills were based on the readings of the corresponding period of 2019. It means even if, say a store was shut during the lockdown and had no electricity consumption, it was to be billed on the basis of the power consumed during the same period last year. According to directives issued by the power regulator last month, provisional billing now is to be done only in those cases where the meter could not be read or recorded by the discom during the billing cycle owing to the lockdown. Consumers who send the meter readings on their own get a rebate of Rs 20 and actual bills.“The distribution licensee (discom) shall raise such provisional bill for the fixed charges and associated applicable charges only, considering the energy consumption as nil,” the DERC’s order stated. Explaining the reason for the decision, the power regulator said consumers in the industrial and non-domestic tariff category had reported they were “facing difficulty” as the provisional bills issued by the discoms were “on a much higher side” since they were based on last year’s usage. “Whereas, because of closure of units due to the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic and a direction of the government in this regard, the actual consumption of such units/ establishments is almost nil/negligible,” the order read. Gauging revenue losses from the DERC’s order and with the lockdown rules relaxed, the discoms have now called their meter reading officials to re-start work. “In support of the government’s measures to contain the spread of Covid-19, some BSES services including meter reading and bill distribution, had been curtailed. But now, adhering to all the necessary safety precautions, we have restarted meter reading for a certain section of our consumers. The exercise will be ramped up in the coming days so consumers can be given actual bills based on their consumption. Bills raised prior to DERC’s order have been reversed, so these complaints have already been addressed,” said a BSES spokesperson. Discom Tata Power-DDL said it had issued provisional bills to around 1.25 lakh non-domestic consumers in north and northwest Delhi areas since April. “Out of 1.25 lakh, we have already revised the bills of around 90,000 consumers. Fortunately, the rest of our non-domestic consumers have smart meters or AMR systems because of which the actual bills got automatically generated even during the lockdown,” said a TPDDL spokesperson.For the traders and factory owners, the DERC’s order was a welcome step, but it was not enough as some demanded a moratorium on power bill payments till June 30. “This (DERC’s order) just partially resolves our problem. Industries have just started to open up. The industries have been closed for over two months. It is wrong to expect people to pay the electricity bills right away. The power regulator should issue a moratorium on payment of bill till June 30 for non-domestic connections,” said Raghuvansh Arora, vice-president of Apex Chamber of Commerce and Industries (ACCI).Arora added, “When neighbouring states such as Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Rajasthan, Punjab can waive off fixed charges during the lockdown period and provide relief, why can’t it be done in Delhi? DERC, on the other hand, did just the opposite by imposing fixed charges and excusing us from paying the energy charges.”A large number of industrial units in Narela and Bawana industrial areas, which has nearly 25,000 small and big industries, have been issued provisional bills by the discoms since April.Rajesh Garg, secretary of Indian Council for Trade and Industries and a factory owner in Narela, said, “As business is at an all-time low now and with migrant labours going back home, it is becoming difficult to restart our units. The government should support the industrial and traders for the economy to get back to normal. The centre has provided financial assistance to discoms. As work will take time to pick up, we request the government to charge for actual consumption of electricity.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/provisional-power-bills-to-commercial-consumers-only-on-fixed-charges-taxes-directs-derc/story-aZYJXljsrFhaZ8ssUgzgeJ.html
10-06-2020||Delhi||HC notice to govts on testing non-Covid patients||The Delhi high court on Tuesday sought responses from the Centre and the Delhi government on a plea seeking directions to test non-Covid-19 patients requiring surgeries and other procedures in hospitals.A bench of justice Hima Kohli and justice Subramonium Prasad issued notices to the authorities. The petitioner, advocate Sanjeev Sharma, also sought directions to the authorities to publish the correct Covid-19 data on their websites. The matter would be now heard on June 11.The application was filed in an earlier petition by advocate Rakesh Malhotra, who alleged the state was not taking expeditious steps to furnish test reports. The court had disposed of the plea, directing the government to furnish reports within two days of the samples being collected. On Tuesday, advocate Sharma told the court that there were several stories on social media, which highlighted “apathy” of city hospitals and government “inaction”, despite the surge in Covid-19 cases as well as deaths associated to the disease.The court on Tuesday also issued notice to the Delhi government on a similar plea filed by an ENT specialist Dr Manni Hingorani, who had also sought testing of asymptomatic persons undergoing surgery.The plea, filed through advocate Aman Hingorani, said not testing such patients would not only increase the risk to the patient but also expose doctors, nurses and other hospital staff to the virus.

10-06-2020||Delhi||HC directs govt to ascertain the number of labourers stranded at Azadpur Mandi||The Delhi High Court on Tuesday directed the sub-divisional magistrate (SDM), Model Town, to identify in two days the number of labourers stranded at the Azadpur wholesale market who are in need of meals or shelter.A bench of justices Hima Kohli and Subramonium Prasad noted that the Delhi government did not have clarity on the number of labourers stranded at the Azadpur Mandi due to the lockdown. The court asked the SDM to file a detailed affidavit on this aspect and posted the next hearing for June 16.The court issued the order while hearing a plea by the Potato and Onion Merchant Association, through its president, that sought directions to ensure that about 1,000 labourers stranded at the market are provided two meals a day, until the situation normalises.The plea, filed through advocates Sumit Rana and Amit Jain, sought that the stranded workers be relocated to a makeshift shelter home within or around the Azadpur Mandi.On Tuesday, advocate Anuj Aggarwal, the additional standing counsel for the Delhi government, told the court that there are two hunger relief centres within the Azadpur Mandi and two other centres within a 150-metre radius. He said that four hunger relief centres have been providing 1,300 lunch and dinner packets, each, every day.The government told the court that there is a DUSIB shelter home at Sarai Peepal Thala near Azadpur Mandi, where the stranded persons, including the labourers, can stay. “Besides the above, there are three temporary shelter homes established in three schools located at Model Town-III, Azadpur Colony and Dhaka Village,” Aggarwal told the court.Disputing the facts, the counsels for the petitioner contended that the figure given by the Delhi government is far below the actual number of labourers stranded. The court then said there is no clarity on the number of the stranded labourers and the “SDM of the area ought to have undertaken an exercise and come up with clear figures”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/hc-directs-govt-to-ascertain-the-number-of-labourers-stranded-at-azadpur-mandi/story-zXDLUYxGo5Ar0RBevVC7FN.html
10-06-2020||Chandigarh||A decade on, no progress on housing plan for poor in Mohali||That housing for poor remains low priority for Greater Mohali Area Development Authority (GMADA) is evident from the fact that even after 12 years of notifying the Punjab housing and habitat policy to build EWS houses it has yet to act upon it.It has been more than five years now since GMADA got 230 acres of land back from 46 builders as part of the policy, but plans to build 22,000 housing units have not been framed as yet.According to GMADA’s proposal in November last year, in the first stage, the authority will build 5,000 houses in four of its townships on about 54 acres of land: 13.49 acres in Aerocity , 17.48 acres in IT city, 3.60 acres in Eco-City-1 and 20.17 acres in Eco-City-II. As many as seven houses will be built with four floors including the ground floor on about one acre of land with each unit sold for Rs10 lakh.EWS POLICY REVISED THRICE IN 12 YEARSThe Punjab cabinet at a meeting in 2008 approved the policy to build EWS houses, but when private builders who were earlier meant to initiate the project did not show any inclination to go ahead with it, a decision was taken by the district administration to let GMADA take over.The authority, which has 25 mega projects and more than 100 approved colonies under its ambit, then took possession of the land earmarked for the project from the private builders.Later in its 2013 notification, the housing and urban development department informed the Punjab Urban Planning and Development Authority (PUDA) and other such bodies that if builders it (PUDA) approved failed to build EWS houses they should transfer the land to the government. Plans were again approved in 2016 for GMADA to utilise land transferred to it by builders for other purposes and the money earned used to build EWS houses.A senior GMADA official involved in the project admitted that the venture was delayed as some private builders had not returned the land meant to the authority and now because of the lockdown work cannot be done on the project. “We are in the process of finalising the layout and other plans for the units,” he saidSocial activist Satnam Singh Daun, who has been campaigning for long for the rights of EWS category candidates, said it was disappointing that even after 12 years, GMADA was not ready with plans for the housing project.“The poor have been deprived of their houses, we will wait for a few more days after which we will start our agitation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/a-decade-on-no-progress-on-housing-plan-for-poor-in-mohali/story-YIHl0DhJGXGhJfnk8uOT9M.html
10-06-2020||Mumbai||Tourism boost for Sindhudurg: State allots 54.40 hectares to Taj Hotel group for five-star centre||In its bid to push a proposal stuck for more than 25 years, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra government on Tuesday decided to allot land measuring 54.40 hectares in Shiroda in Vengurla tehsil of Sindhudurg to Indian Hotels Company Limited, which runs Taj Hotels, for a five-star tourism centre. The land has been given at 90-years lease at a nominal rent for the construction of cottages in Vengurla for tourism development. The proposal of the allotment of land for the construction of the hotel to the leading players in the hotel industry was taken after the state government announced Sindhudurg as a tourism district more than two decades ago. After a decision of allotting land to the Taj Group was taken in 1994, the land was acquired in stages till 1998 by the Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC). Part of the land is in the group’s possession, while it has been pushing for possession of the remaining land. The state cabinet on Tuesday decided to hand over the remaining part of the plot, which is a connecting track of land to other two plots handed over to the company. “The plot is allotted at the nominal lease rent of ₹1 and a premium of 110% of the existing ready reckoner rate will be applicable on it,” said an official from the revenue department. “The proposal was stuck in limbo for years for various reasons, but it is being pushed after the Shiv Sena-led government took over the reins in the state. The state government intends to promote tourism and attract foreign tourists landing in adjoining Goa. Under the tourism promotion scheme there were few more leading hotels who had been allotted the land, but they have opted out from the scheme. We expect the Taj Hotels group to construct the cottages and resorts in Vengurla at the earliest,” said an official from the tourism department.The official said that the part of the plot comes under CRZ-I and construction on it would not be allowed, while the remaining part of the plot can have cottage-type structures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/tourism-boost-for-sindhudurg-state-allots-54-40-hectares-to-taj-hotel-group-for-five-star-centre/story-ZqfJcUbFdbia26aduOvcuI.html

Three of the accused, including one of the shooters, have been arrested. Later, on June 2, two men opened fire outside a liquor shop owned by Ram Avtar Batra in the posh Sector 9 locality, leaving four people injured.While Singla has denied having received any extortion call, Batra had hinted at a financial dispute.“We have secured Deepu’s custody and investigations are on. He will be questioned with regards to his and other accused’s involvement,” said Nilambari Vijay Jagdale, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Chandigarh. Hailing from a poor family, Deepu came in contact with Bishnoi through gangster Sampat Nehra during his stay in the Patiala jail. Later in 2017, Deepu had helped in the escape of another gang member from the Haryana Police custody after a shootout at the Panchkula civil hospital. At present, he was lodged at the Ambala jail for the contract killing of Banur councillor Preeti Walia’s husband in September 6, 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/firing-outside-chandigarh-bizman-s-house-bishnoi-key-aide-s-grilling-points-to-extortion-racket/story-MOgcgKYUsX4aRulvpfmRhL.html

On the second day after public buses started plying, many working people struggled to reach their offices. Although queues were formed at the bus depot, the increasing crowd made it difficult to maintain social distancing. “We reached the bus depot around 9am and there were fewer people then. They were wearing masks and gloves and waiting in a queue. However, as chaos regarding the bus routes began, the crowd increased and people had to forgo social distancing. It took an hour for me to find a bus to Bhiwandi,” said Nitin Choghule, 38, a resident of Kalyan. Crowding at the bus depot continued till 10.30am.Like Choughule, there were hundreds of others who were waiting for buses. “Without any other public transport, people are relying on the state transport facility.

Functioning out of the narrow lanes of the slums, with the aid of volunteers who assisted in cleaning, cutting, and packing the meals, the kitchens continued till May 31.“The kitchen in Janta Nagar is still functioning, but we might stop in a few days since there are no funds. From two meals a day, we are now preparing dinner for about 1,400 people,” said Umar Shaikh, 52, who was running the kitchen in Janta Nagar.“We started the kitchen after realising that even if we distribute dry rations, bigger families with 10-12 people might exhaust it within a few days. Around 70% of the people living in these areas don’t even have ration cards to avail any benefits,” said Shaikh, who runs a plywood business when he is not volunteering.The kitchens functioned with institutional funding arranged by the Tata Institute of Social Sciences’ (TISS) M-ward project and help from organisations like Ghar Bachao, Ghar Banao Andolan, said Ishaad Shaikh, who works with the M ward project. “We also provided two bananas and eggs to the children in these areas,” he added.In Bainganwadi, volunteers were running two separate kitchens by creating makeshift arrangements in the narrow gullies. “We used to make veg pulao, khichdi, and dal. If we started work at 6am, it would go on till night. We arranged for utensils from caterers and also learnt to cook,” said Shakir Hussain, who works with the Mumbai-based Centre for Promoting Democracy and Pani Haq Samiti.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/no-funds-for-food-4-community-kitchens-in-mumbai-slums-run-dry/story-gxcSZQT2S7s9EEXNKejOsN.html

The family members had asked for extra time from the hospital to arrange for the money. Till the time the fees were paid and the discharge procedure was completed, the man was made to wait outside the hospital.“My grandfather had a cold as we took him for a checkup. A swab test was done and his report came positive. He was admitted on May 27 at Kaushalya Hospital and on June 5 we got a call from the hospital that he will be discharged the same day. We were told to clear bills amounting to ₹64,000. We did not have that much money in hand and requested the hospital to give us time till morning to make arrangements. However when we reached the hospital in the morning our grandfather was hungry and unattended to, he looked exhausted too,” said the 24-year-old granddaughter of the patient.Hospital authorities have denied the allegations. “The allegation is false and baseless. The patient has received the best treatment possible which is proved by the fact that even being 85 years old and Covid positive, he could go home ‪in 10 days. Complaints like these, which belittle doctors and hospitals, should not be encouraged as they will demoralise the medical fraternity,” said Anant Naik, administrator, Kaushalya Hospital.TMC is responsible for all Covid treatments within its jurisdiction. “Although I have not personally received a written complaint on this, I am aware of this situation and similar discrepancies. Hence, on Tuesday in a special meeting with all hospitals, I have cautioned them to not wrongfully restrain patients for money, insurance, or other needs. This is a punishable offence. I will look into the matter and authorise someone to inquire about the incident in detail,” said Vishwanath Kelkar, deputy commissioner, health department, TMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/85-year-old-kept-waiting-outside-thane-hospital-overnight-over-bill-dues/story-5AyXZPkcpvzgQLoExbpz5I.html

It was later discovered that the patient had died in a train accident at Borivli railway station on Monday. The victim had reportedly developed severe body pain and vomiting on Saturday when the family got him admitted to Shatabdi Hospital. His Covid-19 test results came back positive on Sunday and he was shifted to a Covid ward. The family was quarantined as well. The man’s grandson, said, “We got a call from Shatabdi Hospital on Monday morning around 8am, asking for the whereabouts of the patient as they said that he was missing from the ward.”The family searched for the patient until Monday night. When they asked around at Borivli railway station, they were informed that he had died in a train accident. “We were shattered after hearing the news. The locals said that my grandfather had committed suicide on the railway tracks,” the grandson said.Other patients in the Covid ward told the family that a dead body was kept on the neighbouring bed, wrapped in plastic. “It must have been very traumatic for him to see a dead body lying alongside his bed. The railway tracks are just outside the hospital. He never spoke of having any suicidal thoughts,” the 80-year-old’s relative said.The Government Railway Police found the body on Monday morning and sent it to Shatabdi Hospital. Bhaskar Pawar, senior police inspector at Borivli railway station, said, “The accident took place around 7.30am. The body was sent to the hospital around 9am.” The family now alleges that the hospital, to hide their negligence, made up a story that the patient was missing, despite knowing that he had died in the rail accident. “They could have at least called us to identify the accident victim,” the victim’s grandson said.Amey Ghole, Shiv Sena corporator and health committee chairman, said, “There was a lapse on the security part of the hospital. We will take strict action against the private security firm at the hospital. We are further investigating the matter.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/80-year-old-covid-patient-found-dead-on-railway-tracks-family-claim-hospital-negligence/story-N2gjRBEnJKHbVN6xx54LzI.html

10-06-2020||Noida||Death of pregnant woman: Noida initiates action against 7 hospitals||The Gautam Budh Nagar district administration has initiated action against three government hospitals and four private facilities for denying treatment to a 30-year-old eight-month pregnant woman, who died on June 5.The action comes a day after the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) issued a notice to the Uttar Pradesh government, seeking its action-taken report into this case as well as that of another woman who was allegedly denied treatment by hospitals.A two-member team, comprising chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri and ADM (finance) MN Upadhyay, which was constituted to probe the incidents surrounding the death of the pregnant woman, submitted its report to district magistrate Suhas LY on Tuesday.  The inquiry concluded that the woman, Neelam, a resident of Khoda in Ghaziabad, died as a result of government and private hospitals denying her timely treatment on June 5. Her family had alleged negligence on the part of the hospitals and said they had to ferry her in an auto-rickshaw from one hospital to another over a span of 13 hours, after each one turned her away.The report said Neelam had complained of breathlessness and was rushed to the ESI hospital in Sector 24 by her husband. From there, she was referred to the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS) in Greater Noida. However, the ambulance dropped her off at the district hospital in Sector 30 instead. From there, she was taken to four private hospitals in Noida, each one turning her away citing a lack of beds. Her family then took her to a private hospital in Vaishali, Ghaziabad, which, too, refused to treat her. She was again brought back to GIMS, where she was declared dead. The report found the doctors who checked and referred her, as well as the driver of the ambulance which dropped her outside the district hospital liable for negligence. “If she had to be referred to a higher centre from the district hospital, a senior staff member should have taken that decision. Concerned staff should have informed the senior management,” the report said.“Such instances have occurred in the past as well and points to supervisory negligence. We have written to the state government to transfer Dr Vandana Sharma, chief medical superintendent (CMS) of the district hospital,” Suhas said. He also said the government has been urged to act against the staff nurse and ward attendant of the district hospital.“The four private hospitals had claimed that they did not have beds available, but the inquiry found the staff and management of these hospitals were negligent. The CMO has been asked to issue a show-cause notice to the hospitals, form a technical committee for further investigation and register FIRs against them,” the DM said.“The director of GIMS has been asked to identify the doctors and staff who first refused the family and take action against them,” the DM’s office said. The Ghaziabad district magistrate has been asked to take appropriate action against the hospital in Vaishali.Suhas has also asked the CMO to issue an advisory to all private and government hospitals to ensure that in cases of emergency, no patient should be denied treatment. However, if referring a patient to another hospital is unavoidable, then there should be proper coordination between the two hospitals.The NHRC has issued a notice to the state government over this incident and also in connection with another incident in which a 26-year-old pregnant woman was denied admission by the district hospital and she ended up giving birth to a stillborn girl outside the hospital. A detailed report from the state has been sought within four weeks, citing the action taken against erring doctors/ officials.Suhas said, “Action is being taken against negligent parties and carelessness will not be tolerated.” Taking cognizance of the cases of negligence, the administration has issued a dedicated emergency helpline number (0120-2569901) which will be operational 24 hours to help those in urgent need of treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/death-of-pregnant-woman-noida-admin-initiates-action-against-seven-hospitals-that-denied-her-treatment/story-zhkZ2H2soy658Gm4lCOrJK.html

Many private hospitals said that healthcare professionals are still are performing their duties despite the fear of getting exposed to the virus. To motivate the staff, hospitals are providing counselling and treatment to those who have tested positive for Covid-19. A few of these hospitals have even increased the salaries of their healthcare workers.“In the first few months, there was panic among healthcare professionals. A few of them left their jobs because of the fear. But due to lockdown and the slowing down of the economy, some of the nurses have resumed their duties again,” said the representative of Park and Signature Hospitals. “At least, 10-15 nurses in both hospitals have resumed their duties. We have raised the salary of our workers to raise their motivation level. We are also providing them with separate hotel rooms for lodging and offering them counselling,” said Dr AK Dubey, spokesperson, Medanta Medicity. According to Dubey, the health workers feel apprehensive if a fellow health worker is tested positive. “They have doubts regarding their own safety as they too have families. We are ensuring their issues are addressed,” he said.Hospital authorities said that they are trying to make their staff feel secure as the biggest worry for health workers is exposing their families to the coronavirus. “It creates a sense of fear. We are trying to address that fear by ensuring the availability of protective gears, such as personal protective equipment (PPE) for our workers. Secondly, we have assured they will be treated in the facility if they are tested positive,” said Dr Ritu Garg, zonal director, Fortis Memorial Research Institute. According to her, a few of the health care workers, who tested coronavirus positive are undergoing treatment in the hospital’s Gurugram branch. Dubey also said that their staff who have tested positive are undergoing treatment free of cost in the facility itself.Most of these hospitals are also taking the help of psychiatrists and psychologists to counsel the staff regularly. For this purpose, Max Hospital said that they have launched an employee assistance programme. “This is managed by our psychology team. Also, a direct hotline is provided to employees to talk about any symptoms their families or they might be facing. To motivate the staff, various recognition programmes have been launched. It includes interventions, such as stories of role models, words of warriors, hall of fame to recognise their contribution,” said the spokesperson.Shashidharan, president, World Malayalee Council – Harayana Province, said, “We have been demanding counselling of healthcare workers working in different private hospitals of the city. Most of the nurses are from Kerala, who are young and staying alone. If they are tested Covid-19 positive, they feel as if it is the end of their life.” The council has been vocal about the safety of the nursing staff since April. Citing the recent case of a nurse who committed suicide after being tested positive, he said, “Hospitals should be sensitive while declaring the reports to health staff. They should even provide accommodation, so that they are not left alone at the time of a crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/private-hospitals-provide-counselling-free-treatment-and-salary-hike-to-healthcare-workers/story-ntXAJQepPA9lx7bTTwdbwK.html
10-06-2020||Gurugram||GMDA to bring all arms of Covid-19 response onto single mobile platform, state-wide rollout on cards||The Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), the primary urban planning body in the city, is attempting to bring together various aspects of the district’s Covid-19 response management on one technological platform. Titled HrHeal, and available as a web portal and mobile phone application, the project will “create a single online location wherein residents and officials can access any information, data or services related to the Covid-19 pandemic,” according to an official in the authority’s GIS department. Officials said that HrHeal—which has been available for download for about 10 days now—incorporates various functionalities, from helping ASHA workers with contact tracing, to facilitating telemedicine consultations between patients and doctors. The app also provides realtime data and analysis of Covid-19 numbers (across Haryana’s 22 districts) via a public dashboard. The dashboard, which is also accessible via a web browser, will help officials generate custom reports using state-level data. It will, in the future, also provide realtime numbers for the state’s 22 districts, including key metrics such as doubling rate, recovery rate, fatalities and test-positivity ratio. A spokesperson from the office of Sonal Goel, additional CEO, GMDA, said, “The authority’s role is to ensure the integrated planning and provision of urban amenities, which includes healthcare services. With that in mind, the GMDA is building its capacity to support the health department and municipal corporation, which are carrying out contact tracing, testing and isolation of patients. It is also trying to ensure a more streamlined way to respond to citizen concerns.” Dr Sultan Singh, head of the GMDA’s GIS department, explained some of these functionalities. “First, in April, we built a tool to help people access their Covid-19 test results online, followed by a public dashboard, which collected data about district-wise Covid-19 cases across Haryana. We initially launched these tools via the GMDA’s OneMapGGM website, and they will also be available via HrHeal,” he said.Singh also added that, if successful in Gurugram district, HrHeal’s functionalities would be replicated state-wide. “For example, we have created a heat-map of Covid-19 in Gurugram by mapping the physical location of each case, and its current status, whether active or recovered, along with each person’s age, gender, and date of detection. If a user downloads HrHeal, then the app will send them realtime alerts about their location while they are travelling, whether they are near a containment zone or emerging cluster,” he said, adding that this feature is currently being tested in Gurugram only. Yet another feature, which was rolled out on Tuesday, is the district’s telemedicine helpline, which can be accessed via HrHeal. “Users can connect with close to 3,200 doctors who have registered to provide services via telephone consultation,” Singh said, explaining that the app contains all the functionality of the Centre’s Aarogya Setu app, with some added features based on feedback from citizens.HrHeal also contains an “automated contact tracing” module to help ASHA workers monitor their subjects more closely, officials revealed, while a B2B version is being developed to help large-scale employers track their employees, as more and more of them start returning to work. “For example, a corporate company with, say, 5,000 employees, can use a customisable version of the app for internal management. This is something we are working on rolling out within this month,” Singh said.Another important feature, presently available only for Gurugram, is a public repository of doctors, hospital beds, Covid Care Centres, blood banks, testing labs, sample collection sites, and so on, in addition to the number of relief shelters and volunteers operative in the city for migrant workers. The repository, available via both the HrHeal app and the OneMapGGM website, on Tuesday, showed that 6,626,531 food packets have been distributed by volunteers in the city so far and that 84,257 movement passes have been requested (of which 52,792 have been rejected, while 11,592 are pending). It also shows that there are presently 35 active shelter homes in the district housing 31,632 migrants. Data about the district’s healthcare infrastructure is also available. For example, the latest data shows that there are 944 hospitals in Gurugram, of which 19 are dedicated Covid-19 hospitals, along with 23 Covid Care Centres. “These locations have also been mapped out to help users, along with the contact numbers of over 3,000 doctors,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gmda-to-bring-all-arms-of-covid-19-response-onto-single-mobile-platform-state-wide-rollout-on-cards/story-pyjJn4ONEMKMVlO7SJ14gJ.html
10-06-2020||Delhi||Delhi’s wholesale hub Sadar Bazar set to open shops on Wednesday||After remaining shut for two months, Sadar Bazar traders will reopen their shops from Wednesday as the authorities re-demarcated boundaries of the containment zones in the area, officials said. According to officials of the district disaster management authority, after re-demarcation, Sadar Bazar will have six containment zones. The market has been declared a buffer zone. “As per inputs from the district medical team, it was imperative to redraw boundaries of Sadar Bazar containment zones to reduce the hardship of residents and to facilitate effective implementation of the disinfection drive as well as strict perimeter control. A couple of active cases reported have been mapped and small pockets have been identified as micro-containment zones while the remaining area has been declared a buffer zone as has been done in many other cities,” an order issued by the District Magistrate (Central) Nidhi Srivastava said. Srivastava said since the market is in the buffer zone, traders are required to take adequate measures to maintain social distancing. The order said in the containment zones, only essential activities will be allowed. “There shall be strict perimeter control to ensure there is no movement of people in or out of containment zones, except for medical emergencies and for maintaining supply of essential goods and services,” it said. The traders’ body said they had been waiting to open shops as they suffered huge losses during the lockdown. “The market houses at least 40,000 shops. The traders had a hard time, running short on savings. We will open shops after so long. We don’t know the condition of the stock. We will clean up tomorrow and start attending to customers later. We will take all precautions to maintain a six-feet distance and regularly sanitise the area,” Paramjeet Singh Pamma, vice-chairman, Federation of Sadar Bazar Traders Association, said. The traders’ body had been demanding reopening of shops since other markets in the city opened last month. They had written to Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, saying 70% of Sadar Bazar was purely commercial and that the cases were being reported from residential pockets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sadar-bazar-set-to-open-shops-on-wednesday/story-zXhIP6HJ9QWEiqusCKyLLP.html
10-06-2020||Pune||PMC standing committee approves widening of 6 metres roads up to 9 metres||PUNE: The standing committee of Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has approved to widen six-metre-wide roads up to nine-metre-wide in the city, a move meant to boost redevelopment. The proposal was approved on Tuesday though all political parties except Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) opposed it.According to PMC standing committee chairman Hemant Rasane, the decision will encourage people to go for redevelopment as wider roads will enable builders to use additional floor space index (FSI) which in turn will create more flats. FSI indicates how many floors a developer can build on a plot. It is the ratio of total built-up area to the size of the plot. “Many internal six-metre-wide roads in the city are an obstacle to redevelopment works. By giving permission to widen these roads up to nine-metre will help citizens consume additional floor space index by loading transfer development rights (TDR). It will help citizens to get more area and PMC will get more revenue by boosting the construction industry,” said Rasane.Earlier, the proposal was only limited to 323 roads before the PMC standing committee amended it and gave nod to all the new one covering all roads.With the BJP in majority in PMC, the proposal was passed by 10 against 6 votes with all the opposition parties opposing it. The opposition parties held a joint press conference on Tuesday and opposed the proposal.Nationalist Congress Party’s city unit president Chetan Tupe said, “BJP’s policy has been selective. Without a proper survey, they approved the proposal with the only intention to collect money from builders. Chief minister Devendra Fadnavis himself took a decision not to give additional FSI for properties located on 6-metre-wide roads, now BJP’s own leaders are going against Fadnavis’s decision. The BJP should now either accept that Fadnavis’s decision was wrong or they took the decision for personal interests.”Congress leader Arvind Shinde said, “BJP first choose the roads mainly in Baner, Balewadi and other areas and later amended it. They know areas where new projects are coming and whom to give benefit by clearing road projects on case to case basis. The proposal will only benefit selective people.”Decision would end bungalow culture in Pune: BagulWidening of the 6-metre-roads up to nine metres would end bungalow culture in Pune, said Congress leader Aba Bagul. “Builders and goons would threat bungalow owners to come forward for redevelopment. Former BJP chief minister Devendra Fadnavis himself made the act and banned allowing additional TDR on six-metre-roads, but the same party took a decision against it,” Bagul said.The Congress leader said that the party will oppose it and try to save Pune’s bungalow culture. “The roads would not get widened on the ground, but by using the provision additional FSI would get consumer by builders on Laxmi Road. The proposal is illegal as per MRTP Act as standing committee did not have right to take decision for all the roads, but only for certain roads.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pmc-standing-committee-approves-widening-of-6-metres-roads-up-to-9-metres/story-D7v2cD7FhZ8Q52plHuiFzH.html

The Pune fitness club association has submitted a memorandum to Pune divisional commissioner, Deepak Mhaisekar, and Pune municipal commissioner requesting to grant permission to open fitness clubs.“The government has still not issued any guidelines for us. As gyms are shut we have been impacted financially. At least the government should come out with a solution for us,” said Nilesh Kale, president of Pune fitness club association.Along with gym owners, trainers are also financially hit as they are not receiving salaries due to the non-operation of gyms.“At least allow us one-on-one training, we are ready to follow social distancing norms as it will allow us to get some financial support,” added Kale.The association has also asked the government to help them financially. “If the government can open wine shops then why are gyms not open yet which helps keep one fit,” added Kale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/owners-flex-muscles-call-for-gyms-to-open/story-IHfrf9ehjuh2C2Y7fzC0tO.html

Instead, efforts should be made to bring down the mortality rate. If early detection happens, it will bring down the mortality rate.” Kumar, on Tuesday, cited community participation as being a key factor in Pune’s ability to handle the Covid-19 situation.Kumar visited the Smart city control room on Tuesday where he said, “Pune is the best city for community participation in the country. People come forward with positive suggestions and the administration must take them up to fight against Covid-19. Community participation will help bring down the burden on administration.”The central team were on a two-day visit to Pune and spent part of the second day video conferencing with various district heads in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/community-participation-micro-contact-tracing-low-mortality-rate-centre-lays-out-pune-plan/story-G0IyAc0hHtlHuDRqs4fgBL.html
10-06-2020||Pune||Pune hospitals claim updates on bed availability not reflecting on Covid Care dashboard||The ‘Covid Care Software’ dashboard, newly launched by the Pune divisional commissioner, which shows real-time data of availability of beds currently displays no isolation beds available in 19 out of 82 hospitals allocated for Covid-19 treatment in the city.This includes government and cantonment hospitals and private hospitals, including Jehangir Hospital, Noble Hospital and the Sahyadri hospital.As per the dashboard, of the 24,292 beds which have been allocated for Covid-19, 9,976 were vacant as of Monday evening. Also, of the 76 allocated ICU beds with ventilators, only eight are vacant and available. PMC Commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “Currently there is no shortage of beds in the Covid care centres for those who do not require critical care. Many people eligible to be discharged are also housed at the centres as they live in slum areas. The shortage is likely to be in critical care, like those who might need ICU or ventilators. For that too, we will take out individual orders for the 100 hospitals eligible for 80 per cent of reservation of beds. We are in the process of issuing orders.” Dr (Col) Satyajit S Gill, medical director at Jehangir Hospital said, “Yes, we are running full, but this is a dynamic thing as we keep discharging patients and we have beds for more patients. Also we do accommodate suspected patients who are awaiting results, but could be possible suspects based on their X-ray, oxygen saturation and other symptoms.”Dr H K Sale, executive director of Noble Hospital, said, “It is true that our hospital’s isolation beds are full, but often the dashboard is also not up to date and shows old data, even though we do keep updating it. Also, we do ensure that we have at least two ICU beds available for emergency and on standby. “Dr Sunil Rao, group medical director at Noble, said, “The dashboard does not give real-time data and we have conveyed this to the civic body and other authorities repeatedly. We have been sending updates twice daily. However, I guess it would take at least a few more days for the data to be synced completely. Two of our hospital branches are full and most of our ICU beds and ventilators are also occupied.”With increasing cases in Cantonment areas, the Cantonment hospitals are also reporting no vacant isolation beds, which includes Khadki Cantonment Board’s Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Cantonment General Hospital and Khadki Sports Complex which totally have 40 allocated isolation beds together.Pune Cantonment’s Sardar Vallabhai Patel hospital which has 70 allocated isolation beds also has no vacant beds and Dehu road Cantonment board’s Dr Babasaheb Cantonment General Hospital and the Dehu road Covid Care Centre at the MG School has 10 allocated isolation beds, that currently show not vacant on the dashboard.

Reliance infra cites Covid-19 situation for delay and states that 96 per cent of the work is completed.NHAI served the notice on May 21 for the project to be executed under built operate and transfer (BOT) under national highway development programme phase 4.The notice stated “It is submitted that the appointed date was declared 1.10.2010 and you had commenced the work with effect to that date. The scheduled completion date 30.03.2013 which subsequently got modified as 31.12.2015 for which a supplementary agreement was entered into between the authority and the concessionaire on 30.10. 2014. It is pertinent to note that the project highway has to be maintained by the concessionaire till the project is completed and thereafter also during the maintenance period i.e. during the entire concession period.”The notice continued, “It is to be noted that the authority and independent engineer intimated about the importance of highways/diversions, lack of safety measures, slow progress of work on a number of occasions. Even show cause notices were served earlier vide authority letter no. 2001 and 2002 dated 27.07.2014 and no. 1568 dated 13.10.2016.“Though the concessionaire had promised to address the issue immediately but the inspections carried out by NHAI officials and independent engineers revealed that the position has further deteriorated instead of improvement.”A Reliance Infra’s spokesperson for Pune-Satara toll road said, “We were issued intention to terminate notice by NHAI which has already been responded last week. The project is in advanced stage of completion, with 98.2 per cent work already completed. The project was expected to be completed by May 31, 2020 for which the authorities had already recommended extension. Work was in progress as per target but had to be suspended due to Covid-19 pandemic from March 20. The government of India has already announced extension of 6 months for projects in progress due to the Covid-19 crisis. Pre-monsoon works are in progress and there is shortage of labour. We are sourcing local labour to continue. The project will be completed as per the extension granted by authority under Covid-19.”The notice made critical observations like “It goes without saying that all the above incidents and neglect on the part of the concessionaire has invited public wrath and number of agitations are taken up by various organisations demanding stoppage of toll collection etc because of poor condition of the highway which the concessionaires had not paid heed to even after several reminders and after getting various EOT’s . Such neglect towards public safety and non-compliance with the terms of the CA henceforth attracts the clause 37.1.2 of CA,” the notice said.In view of the above, the concessionaire is hereby notified of authorities intention to issue termination notice under the clause of 37.1.2 of the concession agreement and concessionaire is hereby is at liberty to make representation as to why it should not be terminated within 15 days of the receipt of the notice, the notice warned“They were given 15 days and there have been contractual issues and notice served by the headquarter. It is our intention notice and they have responded to our notice and we are looking into it. We have received their reply a few days ago and only 4 per cent of the work is left,” said Suhas Chitnis, project director, NHAI.RTI activist Vivek Velankar said that the said notice should have been given much earlier citing that toll has been collected for nine years by the company. “Will action be taken and toll collection stop? There are a number of questions which need to answered. The notice will turn out to be a farce in the long run if it is not implemented in letter and spirit,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/nhai-serves-agreement-termination-notice-to-reliance-infra-for-incomplete-pune-satara-road-project/story-HHYmxS9YaW7u7KOM4ujvHM.html

Mookhey approached HC after his bail was rejected by the sessions court on May 2.A single bench of justice Bharati Dangre, while hearing Mookhey’s bail application was informed by his advocates Yusuf Iqbal Yusuf and Zain Shroff that the 75-year-old accused, who was in the PMC Bank’s audit committee, had been in and out of the hospital during his judicial custody since December last year due to his medical condition. The advocates had sought bail on the grounds that Mookhey needed the surgery, which owing to the ongoing Covid-19 outbreak, he prefers to undergo at a private clinic at Mulund. The advocates also submitted that Mookhey was willing to bear all costs, which included police escort fees and treatment cost, if he was permitted to undergo the operation.On May 29, the bench of justice Anuja Prabhudessai directed the private clinic to submit a fitness report after monitoring Mookhey for three days. The application came up for hearing before the bench of justice Dangre after the clinic submitted the report. After perusing the report, the bench granted Mookhey temporary bail on the condition that he deposits the police escort fees.Through his bail application after his arrest on December 3, Mookhey pleaded that he did not have any role in the fraud. The plea was opposed by the state on the grounds that his role was yet to be ascertained. Mookhey then filed for a bail on medical grounds.Who is Jagdish Mookhey?Jagdish Mookhey was on the audit committee of the bank from 2005 to 2019. On December 3, Mookhey, along with two other directors – Dr Trupti Bane and Mukti Bavisi – were arrested for their alleged involvement in the ₹6,670 crore.Bane was in the recovery committee from 2010 to 2015, and the loans and advances committee from 2015 to 2019, while Bavisi was a part of the loans and advances committee from 2011 to September 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ex-pmc-bank-director-granted-bail-by-bombay-hc-to-undergo-surgery/story-adsON3MBilnsFRix6ypzpI.html

And it says nearly all the Fed’s policymakers foresee no rate hike through 2022.The Fed has cut its benchmark short-term rate to near zero. Keeping its rate ultra-low for more than two more years could make it easier for consumers and businesses to borrow and spend enough to sustain an economy depressed by business shutdowns and high unemployment.The central bank noted in a statement after its policy meeting ended Wednesday that the viral outbreak has caused a sharp fall in economic activity and surge in job losses.Fed officials estimate that the economy will shrink 6.5% this year, in line with other forecasts, before expanding 5% in 2021. It foresees sees the unemployment rate at 9.3%, near the peak of the last recession, by the end of this year. The rate is now 13.3%.At a virtual news conference Wednesday afternoon, Chairman Jerome Powell is expected to drive home the message that the economy remains in need of extraordinary help despite recent despite glimmers of a possible recovery, including a government report Friday that employers surprisingly added jobs in May.Since March, the Fed has slashed its benchmark short-term rate, bought $2.1 trillion in Treasury and mortgage bonds to inject cash into markets and rolled out nine lending programs to try to keep credit flowing smoothly. Most analysts expect the Fed to pause and assess the economic landscape before embarking on any further actions, which could come at September’s meeting.The Fed’s actions are credited with having helped fuel an extraordinary rally in the stock market, which has nearly regained its pre-pandemic high after a dizzying plunge in March.And by committing to buy corporate bonds, thereby reinvigorating the market for such securities, the Fed has also ensured that corporations can continue to borrow. Its initiatives also include a first-ever program through which the Fed is buying state and local government debt to support the municipal bond market.Many economists say those steps have prevented the downturn from worsening, by keeping credit flowing. This week, the National Bureau of Economic Research, the official arbiter of recessions, declared that the U.S. economy entered a recession in February.One challenge for the Fed now is to shift its focus from the emergency actions it took in March and April to try to carry the economy through a shutdown, to what steps it will take to stimulate a recovery as businesses increasingly reopen.In remarks last month, Fed Vice Chair Richard Clarida stressed that the viral outbreak remains a menace to the economy. But he also indicated that Fed officials want to see a few more months of data to gauge the economy’s health before determining their next steps.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-economy-to-shrink-6-5-in-2020-no-rate-hike-through-2022-fed-officials/story-JkUld05PII391j9nMICM8I.html

There’s millions and millions of infections worldwide. And it isn’t over yet.”The United States, which has been rolling back social distancing measures steadily, is close to crossing the 2 million mark for Covid-19 infections, with 1.97 million Wednesday morning. Fatalities are more than 122,000, with 683 in the past 24 hours.Fauci has been cautioning against hasty withdrawal of the social distancing norms that are understood to have prevented many more deaths in the United States. Though he is a member of a task force set up by President Donald Trump to lead the fight against the epidemic here, Fauci has been odds with the president, who is in a hurry to reopen the economy and get it going full throttle again with an eye on his election prospects.The public health measures in place are only going to work so much to prevent the spread of the deadly virus. But the world needs is a vaccine, or more to get ahead of it. The virus will no “”urn itself out with mere public health measures”, he said, adding, “We’re going to need a vaccine for the entire world, billions and billions of doses”.There are three leading vaccine candidates, among the more than 100 in the works, that have the world’s eyes on them. Moderna is expected start final trials on its vaccine in July; Oxford University and AstraZeneca are looking at a September date for their end trials (with a partner Indian pharmaceutical company contracted to churn out the volumes needed) and Johnson & Johnson has moved up is first stage trials to July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-warns-covid-19-isn-t-over-yet/story-4MsaXjxJK9zYpYfWLdN9RO.html

Three of those appointments happened in the last two months.The military’s heightened profile comes as Prime Minister Imran Khan sees his influence and popularity dwindle due to a slowing economy, high consumer prices and corruption investigations involving his close aides. Analysts have long seen army support as critical for Khan’s party, which holds 46% of seats in parliament, to hold together a government that relies on several smaller coalition partners to stay afloat.In some ways, this is nothing new: The military is Pakistan’s most powerful institution and has directly ruled the country for large parts of its seven-decade history. Yet it’s a far cry from the “New Pakistan” Khan promised when he took office back in 2018.“By appointing an increasing number of current and retired military officials in key positions, the government is ceding what little space civilians had in developing and executing policy in the country,” Uzair Younus, non-resident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, said by phone. “The military’s overt and covert role in governance continues to grow.”Key RolesMany in Pakistan can see the shift during government virus briefings on state television, in which uniformed current army officers are seen assisting the government’s pandemic response. Retired lieutenant general Asim Saleem Bajwa is now Khan’s communication adviser and also oversees the implementation of about $60 billion in Pakistan investments as part of China’s Belt-and-Road Initiative.At least 12 army loyalists in the cabinet also took part in dictator-turned-President Pervez Musharraf’s administration, which ended in 2008. That includes Interior Minister Ijaz Shah and Abdul Hafeez Shaikh, Khan’s finance adviser.The greater military involvement even has the support of civilian government advisers such as Zaigham Rizvi, member of Naya Pakistan Housing Program taskforce in charge of running Khan’s main economic project of building low-cost houses. Two army officers were appointed to the body last month.“There was a feeling that if we give the majority leadership to the army, the army has a good system,” said Rizvi, who worked at World Bank for 10 years as an housing expert. “They get things done.”Pakistan’s army declined to comment. Nadeem Afzal Chan, a spokesman for Khan, wasn’t immediately available, while Information Minister Syed Shibli Faraz didn’t respond to a request for a comment.Economic DistressKhan has long dismissed allegations that he was too close to the military, saying in 2017 ahead of his election win that any notion that he’s an army stooge was a “bizarre conspiracy.” Last year he told local media “the army is standing with me.”Yet economic distress from the pandemic is again raising tensions. Pakistan is the most infected nation in Asia after India, with more than 108,000 coronavirus cases and about 2,200 deaths.The economy is forecast to contract for the first time in 68 years, with the central bank expecting the economy to shrink 1.5% in the year ending June. The nation received an emergency loan of $1.4 billion from the International Monetary Fund in April, and is among countries seeking debt relief.Questions over the army’s role in running the government came to the fore when the virus started escalating in March. While Khan addressed the nation and urged citizens to remain calm, it was the army spokesman who announced the lockdown the next day. Most of the press statements from the country’s virus nerve center, chaired by Planning Minister Asad Umar, are produced by the army’s media wing -- complete with its byline and logo.On March 24, Khan was visibly annoyed when reporters asked him “who is in charge here?” Although there was no reference to the military, he threatened to leave abruptly.Then in late May, his aviation minister, Ghulam Sarwar Khan, defended the national carrier’s performance and its military leadership following a passenger plane crash in the financial capital, Karachi. “It’s not a crime to appoint people affiliated to the military,” he said.Diminishing PowerKhan’s hold on power will likely continue to diminish as current and retired army officers, as well as army-backed political appointees, assume more executive authority, said Arif Rafiq, president of New York-based Vizier Consulting, a risk advisory firm focused on the Middle East and South Asia. He noted Khan will come under further pressure as Pakistan’s economic challenges continue to mount.“The army has signaled its dissatisfaction with Khan’s handling of the coronavirus lockdowns -- there are also indications that the army has not been happy with the handling of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor as well as governance in Punjab, the largest province,” Rafiq said. “We’ve seen the chief military spokesman openly push for a tougher lockdown and a retired army officer assume roles as a government spokesman and top CPEC administrator.”The military last year had already begun taking a more active role in policy making beyond foreign and national security policy, with Army Chief Qamar Javed Bajwa meeting top business leaders privately to find ways to boost the economy. The country’s Parliament adopted a law in January giving Bajwa a three-year extension starting from November 2019 and he was also made a member of a government’s economic board.While many democracies appoint retired military officers to senior government positions, it becomes a problem if the civilians aren’t calling the shots, according to Michael Kugelman, a Washington, D.C. based South Asia senior associate at The Wilson Center.“And herein lies the risk to democracy,” he said. “If retired generals are more influenced by their former bosses than by their current bosses, then democracy is not being properly served.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/army-tightens-grip-on-pakistan-as-imran-khan-s-popularity-wanes/story-8SwnFXn3TlQ3r1EnQOu7rL.html
10-06-2020||World||Europe reopens borders amid worst global recession in memory||The world faces the worst global recession in nearly a century, a key economic body warned Wednesday, while in Europe, restrictions to fight the spread of coronavirus portend a bleak summer tourism season even as more nations announced plans to welcome visitors again.Beginning June 16, Austria will open up to all European neighbors with the exception of Spain, Portugal, Sweden and Britain, meaning that visitors from 31 countries will no longer be required to undergo a two-week quarantine upon arrival. Greece, another European holiday hot spot, will allow tourists to fly to Athens or the main northern city of Thessaloniki beginning on June 15.But that’s hoping people have money to spend.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said Wednesday that global economic output could fall by as much as 7.6% this year if a second wave of infections emerges, with the pandemic’s economic impact expected to be even harsher in Europe because of the continent’s strict and relatively lengthy coronavirus lockdowns.In the eurozone, which includes the 19 European Union nations that use the common euro currency, GDP is expected to plunge 11.5% this year in case of a second wave and by over 9% even if another round of infections is avoided.“Now we’re in the midst of ... perhaps the most global health, economic and social crisis and it’s simply the most severe any of us have ever witnessed,” OECD Secretary General Angel Gurria said during the presentation of the report in Paris. He named tourism and air travel among the “critical” sectors hard hit by the pandemic and urged countries to cooperate in developing and fairly distributing a vaccine for the virus.“As long as a virus is widespread somewhere, the threat will remain everywhere and economic costs will persist as some borders remain closed,” Gurria said, with the report predicting that the crisis would leave “long-lasting scars,” including lower living standards, high unemployment and weak investment.The virus has infected 7.2 million people worldwide and killed nearly 412,000, about 180,000 of them in Europe, according to official figures tallied by Johns Hopkins University. The true toll is believed to be much higher because many people died without being tested.Austrian Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg said the border with Italy to the south would be open without conditions on June 16 but that a travel warning for Austrian citizens was still in place for Italy’s northern region of Lombardy. That region, the epicenter of Italy’s epidemic, has still been showing triple-digit growth in daily infections while much of the rest of the country counts a handful or fewer.While Italy opened its own borders on June 3, Austria’s reluctance to open their shared border has been a sore spot between the two.Austrian Health Minister Rudolf Anschober said restrictions would remain in place for Spain because its own borders remain closed until July 1 for most tourists and for Portugal due to an increase in infections in recent days.‘’Please pack your bags, but don’t forget the situation at home,’’ Anschober said, emphasizing that the virus remains in circulation. ‘’Please consider every trip, whether with the family and on business, and when possible don’t travel.’’Italy’s Coldiretti farm lobby said the Austrian border opening was critical to Italian tourism, which normally registers summer holiday visits by 3.4 million Austrians and 7 million Germans who cross Austria to reach Italy. Coldiretti called Austria’s move “an important signal.” Foreign visitors spent 167 billion euros ($190 billion) last year in Italy, a third of it on food.Contract workers from France’s all-important food, catering and events industry held a protest Wednesday between the Louvre Museum and Champs-Elysees, saying the virus pandemic is killing their jobs. The symbolic flash mob demonstration included about 30 people dressed in black, simulating strangulation with their ties and putting signs reading “sentenced to death” into a coffin.To the south, Spain’s sunny, beautiful Balearic Islands will allow thousands of German tourists to fly in for a two-week trial that tests out how to balance the needs of Spain’s vital tourism industry with new regulations to curb the country’s coronavirus outbreak.The trial that begins June 15 comes before the archipelago and the rest of the country re-open to international tourism on July 1. The Spanish government is under heavy pressure to re-activate an industry that generates 12% of Spain’s GDP and provides 2.6 million much-needed jobs.Hungary said beginning Friday it would fully reopen its borders with Croatia, whose beaches on the Adriatic Coast are a favored destination.Greece will allow international flights to land at regional airports beginning July 1. Visitors arriving from airports not on the European air safety agency list of at-risk regions will be subjected to random spot coronavirus tests but will not face the mandatory testing and quarantine now in place for all international travelers.In some other countries, uncertainty about the tourist season remained.Germany announced it is prolonging its travel warning for more than 160 countries outside Europe until the end of August even as it ends border controls for most EU citizens. Last week, Germany downgraded its travel warning for the rest of the 27-nation EU, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Iceland and Britain.Britain said Wednesday it was planning to re-open zoos, safari parks and drive-in theaters next Monday as it eases lockdown measures. But that is mostly for local tourists only, since this week the government slapped a 14-day quarantine requirement on all arrivals, a move that health experts say comes too late and tourism officials fear will be devastating to their industry.Britain has nearly 41,000 confirmed COVID-19 deaths, the highest death toll in Europe.In Buglaria a rise in infections prompted the government to prolong its state of emergency to the end of June, while in Moscow, the mayor said it will take the Russian capital about two months to lift all of its coronavirus restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-reopens-borders-amid-worst-global-recession-in-memory/story-Jednt76Rj5pEOgHEeO1s6I.html
10-06-2020||World||People with HIV more likely to die if infected with coronavirus, data shows||People with HIV are almost three times more likely to die if they contract the coronavirus than those with no co-morbidities, irrespective of whether they are taking anti-AIDS drugs, an analysis of South African data shows.The finding was made by the Western Cape Department of Health, which oversees medical services in the province with about two thirds of South Africa’s almost 53,000 confirmed coronavirus infections. It considered almost 13,000 cases, including 435 deaths, to produce what it says is the first analysis of the interplay between HIV and the Covid-19.Still, the impact HIV had on mortality was less than expected and well below that of other co-morbidities such as diabetes, although it was higher than tuberculosis, the department said in a presentation. South Africa has the world’s biggest HIV epidemic.“We have been able to quantify the effect of HIV and TB, which until now we haven’t known and we might have expected that effect to really be very large,” said Mary Ann-Davies, director of the Centre for Infectious Disease Epidemiology and Research at the University of Cape Town, who spoke on behalf of the health department. “In fact what we are seeing is fairly modest.”The high prevalence of HIV and TB in South Africa was seen as a potential vulnerability for the country when the coronavirus struck, with concern it would exacerbate death rates. About 7.8 million people in South Africa are infected with HIV, which causes AIDS, while about 300,000 have TB.Epidemiologists had expected that people on anti-AIDS drugs would be less affected than those with HIV who take no treatment, as is the case with influenza.A person carrying HIV is 2.75 times more likely to die when infected with the coronavirus than someone with no co-morbidities, according to the presentation. The ratio for someone with active TB is 2.58 times, while someone who has recovered from TB, which causes lasting lung damage, has a ratio of 1.41.Still, a Covid-19 patient with uncontrolled diabetes is 13 times more likely to die, the department said. Those with well-controlled diabetes still carry a risk of 4.65.While the department said that about 8% of coronavirus deaths in its dataset could be linked to HIV, more work needs to be done to “disentangle” the effects of obesity and poverty. People with HIV in South Africa also tend to be relatively young, which gives them some protection against the disease, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/people-with-hiv-more-likely-to-die-if-infected-with-coronavirus-data-shows/story-v5hHdLXHSRQmGDWjWZz26O.html
10-06-2020||World||UK to reopen zoos, safari parks, but no schools||Britain is planning to reopen zoos, safari parks and drive-in theaters as part of the easing of lockdown measures from the Covid-19 pandemic.But the move by Prime Minister Boris Johnson is facing criticism amid the failure to reopen schools for all primary school students before summer, as had been planned.Although many English primary schools have been open for children of key workers, the Conservative government had wanted to give all pupils the chance to return following months of home learning. But schools didn’t have enough space to address social distancing requirements.Johnson is expected to make the announcement later Wednesday.His Downing Street Office says it hopes that reopening of safari parks and zoos will help families spend time outdoors, where the chance of catching the virus is much lower.London Zoo and other attractions across the country had warned they faced permanent closure if something weren’t done soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-reopen-zoos-safari-parks-but-no-schools/story-9k1SqLsjgcybgJebFsL7yM.html

They would mark the final stage of testing of the vaccine’s safety and effectiveness.Three ProjectsModerna Inc.’s vaccine will be the first in July, followed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca PLC’s shot in August and Johnson & Johnson’s jab in September. A Moderna spokesman confirmed the plan, an AstraZeneca spokeswoman couldn’t confirm the start date and a J&J spokesman declined to comment to Dow Jones.Fauci, the head of the infectious disease agency since 1984, has emerged early on as one of the leading voices in the battle by President Donald Trump’s administration against the pandemic. His statements have sometime run counter to the president’s on topics such as when and whether restrictions should be eased, and he and the White House virus task force have recently been sidelined with fewer appearances before the media.The US has more coronavirus cases than any other country, with about 2 million, and leads the world in pandemic deaths with more than 112,000. Meanwhile, as states such as New Jersey lift stay-at-home orders, Trump has cheered the revival of US employment numbers and stock-market gains.More than 100 vaccines are in development against the coronavirus, according to the World Health Organization.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-pandemic-is-far-from-over-anthony-fauci-warns/story-wrjxxGVAEThZbDjIFNp3AM.html

Should the Covid-19 pandemic worsen, its effect might approach that of the 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic, which had a CFR of more than 2% and caused 50–100 million deaths worldwide,” Gao and his fellow researchers argued in the paper, which was published on June 6.The paper is titled: “Active case finding with case management: the key to tackling the Covid-19 pandemic”Since WHO characterised the Covid-19 epidemic as a pandemic on March 11, 2020, the situation has been worsening.By May 31, 2020, more than 200 countries and areas had been affected and the cumulative number of cases – by June 9 – had exceeded 7.3 million, with rapid daily increases in some countries.While China has brought the outbreak under control since it first broke out from the central Chinese city of Wuhan late last year, Gao and his colleagues had a note of caution.China continues to be at risk of facing a second wave of the coronavirus epidemic as the nearly the entire population of the country remains susceptible to the virus, the study said.The containment and suppression strategies implemented by the government have been successful but the resurgence of the virus remains a possibility as the pandemic rages globally, it said.“The containment strategy has largely been successful in China. From April 1 to May 31, 2020, there have been, on average, 54 infections reported daily by China’s National Health Commission, which were almost all importation cases or second-generation cases from importations, and an average of 0·6 new deaths have been reported each day, with the most recent death reported on April 14, 2020,” the paper said.“There is no known ongoing community transmission, but the risk of local transmission introduced by internationally imported cases remains a major concern. Almost the entire population of China remains susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and, therefore, is at risk of a Covid-19 epidemic,” the paper added.The research indicated that China’s goal in combating Covid-19 is to maintain zero or minimal local transmission until a safe and effective vaccine is developed and widely distributed among the susceptible population.The authors argued only implementing non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) without case finding, isolation and contact tracing will not be enough.“Experience with influenza A (commonly known as the flu) is that NPIs (without case finding, isolation, and contact tracing) can reduce spread by up to 50%, which is potentially insufficient to alleviate critical medical needs caused by the Covid-19 epidemic.”“With ongoing virus transmission, the Covid-19 pandemic might continue indefinitely until relieved by an effective vaccine response.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-could-kill-50-100-million-like-1918-influenza-pandemic-did-lancet-paper/story-KoTdvpnfOWC63xfVMyENhK.html

Our use of coal for electricity had fallen from 70% in 1990 to 3% today”.The milestone was aided by lower demand for electricity during lockdown announced by the Boris Johnson government to deal with the coronavirus pandemic. Fossil fuels have accounted for a dwindling percentage of sources, as reliance grows on renewables and nuclear energy in recent decades.The UK currently has four coal-fired power stations in Yorkshire, two in Nottinghamshire and one in County Atrim, which have not been in operation since April 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-electricity-goes-coal-free-for-record-2-months/story-V8l9jqzwSXXfwEhqt4HRdK.html

The hearing will also provide a platform for House Republicans, who have responded to protests by underscoring their support for police and accusing Democrats of wanting to cut off police funding, which top Democrats oppose. “Where you demonize the police, they stop engaging with the community. If we stand with the police, it will be better for all Americans,” Representative Matt Gaetz, a House Judiciary Republican, tweeted on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-s-brother-to-address-us-house-panel-on-police-reforms/story-SU3n8hKzgs3hYepFGt3NwL.html

Merriam-Webster’s first dictionary definition of ‘racism’ goes like, “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race”. In her letter, Mitchum reasoned that the current definition stands little for what is currently happening across the world and is inadequate. She received an email the very next morning with an assurance that the latest definition is being drafted and will be updated soon. “It’s not just disliking someone because of their race,” she said in her email.Also read: Black Lives Matter - protesters heartened by swift reform, but vow broader changeAlumna Kennedy Mitchum knew there was more to racism than what appeared in @MerriamWebster's dictionary."It’s not just disliking someone because of their race," she said.

10-06-2020||World||Coronavirus triggered century’s worst global recession without a second wave||The virus crisis has triggered the worst global recession in nearly a century -- and the pain is not over yet even if there is no second wave of infections, an international economic report warned Wednesday.Hundreds of millions of people have lost their jobs, and the crisis is hitting the poor and young people the hardest, worsening inequalities, Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development said in its latest analysis of global economic data.“It is probably the most uncertain and dramatic outlook since the creation of the OECD,” Secretary General Angel Gurria said. “We cannot make projections as as we normally do.”In the best-case scenario, if there is no second wave of infections, the agency forecast a global drop in economic output of 6% this year, and a rise of 2.8% next year.If the coronavirus re-emerges later in the year, however, the global economy could shrink 7.6%, the OECD said.“With or without a second outbreak, the consequences will be severe and long-lasting,” the report says.Gurria argued that “presenting the problem as the choice between lives and livelihoods, meaning a choice between health and the economy, is a false dilemma. If the pandemic is not brought under control, there will be no robust economic recovery.”In case of a second wave of contagions, the OECD forecast that the average unemployment rate across the 37 developed countries that it represents would double this year to 10% and see “little recovery” in 2021. In the more optimistic scenario, the figure would be 9.2%. In poorer countries, the numbers are often higher, and informal workers are especially vulnerable.The agency urged governments to tackle inequalities by investing in health care systems, global cooperation on medical supplies, vaccine and treatments and retraining people whose sectors are the hardest-hit.The virus has infected 7.2 million people worldwide and killed at least 411,000, according to official figures tallied by Johns Hopkins University. The true toll is believed to be much higher.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-triggered-worst-global-recession-without-a-second-wave/story-kWwBSu1oGpG7eK13VWlv9O.html
10-06-2020||World||South Korea to charge defector groups over North leaflets||South Korea’s government said Wednesday that it will press charges against two activist groups that have been floating anti-Pyongyang leaflets and bottles filled with rice to North Korea.Any action against the groups is likely to trigger a debate over freedom of expression in South Korea, and whether President Moon Jae-in’s liberal government is sacrificing democratic principles to keep alive his ambitions for inter-Korean engagement.The announcement by Seoul’s Unification Ministry came a day after North Korea said it was cutting off all communication channels with South Korea over its inability to prevent North Korean defectors and other activists from flying the leaflets across the border.One of the targeted defector-activists condemned what he described as a “treacherous” move by Seoul and vowed to launch even more leaflets across the border in coming weeks, using not only balloons but also drones.Yoh Sang-key, the ministry’s spokesman, told reporters the two organizations facing charges had “created tensions between the South and North and brought danger to the lives and safety of (South Korean) residents in border areas.”The ministry said last week that the government would push new laws to ban activists from flying the leaflets across the border, after the North threatened to end an inter-Korean military agreement reached in 2018 to reduce tensions if Seoul failed to prevent the protests.Aside from severing government and military communication channels, the North also said it would permanently shut down a liaison office and a factory park in the border town of Kaesong, which have been major symbols of reconciliation.For years, activists have floated huge balloons into North Korea carrying leaflets criticizing leader Kim Jong Un over his nuclear ambitions and dismal human rights record. The leafleting has sometimes triggered a furious response from North Korea, which bristles at any attempt to undermine its leadership.In 2014, soldiers exchanged fire after South Korean activists released propaganda balloons across the Demilitarized Zone, but no casualties were reported.While Seoul has sometimes sent police officers to block the activists during sensitive times, it had previously resisted North Korea’s calls to fully ban them, saying they were exercising their freedom.Yoh said that the two groups, led by North Korean defector Park Sang-hak and his brother Park Jung-oh, violated a law governing inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation by sending unauthorized materials to the North. The ministry confirmed it was the first time the law, which is designed to prevent South Korean organizations from providing unauthorized goods to North Korea, was being used against defectors’ anti-Pyongyang activities.Park Sang-hak’s Fighters for a Free North Korea has launched balloons with anti-Pyongyang leaflets for years. Park Jung-oh leads the group Keun Saem, which on Monday unsuccessfully tried to float rice-filled bottles into North Korea from a border town before being blocked by South Korean police.“Since when has the Ministry of Unification become the ministry of treason?” Park Sang-hak told The Associated Press. “We will respond not with words but with action, by flying even more leaflets to North Korean people.”Park said he will also try to use drones so that he “could drop the leaflets on Kim Jong Un’s head.” He didn’t say when the launches will happen, but that he was ready “whenever the winds are good.”The ministry didn’t say whether it was planning to take similar legal action against another group led by Lee Min-bok, also a North Korean defector who has been flying leaflets into the North for years.Experts say North Korea’s move to cut off communication channels was likely more than just about leafleting as it comes after months of frustration over Seoul’s unwillingness to defy U.S.-led sanctions and resume inter-Korean economic projects that would breathe life into the North’s broken economy.North Korea has suspended virtually all cooperation with South Korea in recent months amid a stalemate in larger nuclear negotiations with Washington. The talks faltered last year with the Americans rejecting the North’s demands for major sanctions relief in exchange for partial surrender of its nuclear capabilities.South Korea’s government and military said officials tried to contact their North Korean counterparts via several channels after the North’s announcement on Tuesday but got no answer. Yoh said Wednesday his ministry will stop trying before the Koreas agree to resume the channels.The liaison office in Kaesong has been closed since late January after the Koreas agreed to temporarily shut it until the Covid-19 pandemic is controlled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-to-charge-defector-groups-over-north-leaflets/story-u8S2o3Vc1nAT4nBprVtWuL.html
10-06-2020||World||Hong Kong fears oblivion under Chinese dominion||Hong Kong, despite assurances to the contrary from its government and Beijing, is facing an oppressive future as a satellite city of China, one where secret police operate with impunity and the territory’s residents live in perpetual fear.This stems from China’s sudden and unexpected decision in May’s National People’s Congress (NPC) to unilaterally impose national security legislation on Hong Kong. It comes after the territory failed to introduce such an article to its Basic Law mini-constitution in the 23 years since the handover. Ironically, that national security law supposed to be passed by Hong Kong itself is called Article 23.Now, to complete the numerological symmetry, this law foisted onto Hong Kong by Chairman Xi Jinping is likely to be unanimously passed and implemented before the end of this month.This “National People’s Congress Law Concerning Establishing and Strengthening the Safeguarding of National Security for Hong Kong” proscribes any action of “treason, secession, sedition or subversion”. Of course, interpretation of these cardinal sins will be ambiguous so China can interpret them according to its whim.The events of last year, where masses took to the streets to express their displeasure at Chief Executive Carrie Lam and her puppet-like compliance with Xi’s dictates, alarmed Beijing. Somewhat absurdly, there is nothing the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) fears more than the will of the people.This new law is likely to be more draconian than any Article 23. Frighteningly, the draft law stated, “When needed, relevant national security organs of the Central People’s Government will set up agencies in the HKSAR to fulfill relevant duties to safeguard national security in accordance with the law.” This means the Ministry of State Security, China’s version of the Gestapo, will become legally resident.China will doubtlessly also see fit to “improve” Hong Kong’s legal system, where the rule of law still prevails and courts are not yet subservient to the government. Already, peaceful avenues for Hong Kong people to air discontent are rapidly diminishing - whether protests, polls, vigils or in the legislature. These opportunities will be further constricted and crushed under the new law.Journalists, protestors, human rights activists, pro-democracy political groups, NGO activists, missionaries and religious groups all have much to fear. They are liable to be treated the same way in Hong Kong as they are in China, which is detention and imprisonment.Joshua Rosenzweig, Amnesty International’s Deputy Regional Director for East and South East Asia, warned, “This dangerous proposed law sends the clearest message yet that it is eager to do the same in Hong Kong, and as soon as possible. The Hong Kong government has progressively embraced the Mainland’s vague and all-encompassing definition of ‘national security’ to restrict freedom of association, expression and the right to peaceful assembly.”Responding to a question from ANI, Dennis Kwok, a Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker, was asked to envision what Hong Kong might soon look like. A chilling scenario could see Chinese security agents breaking down citizens’ doors, all protests banned, extradition of dissenters to China, reporters detained, people with business or personal contacts overseas come under intense scrutiny to counter the vague notion of “foreign interference”, and children being brainwashed at school.When presented with such a scenario, Kwok responded: “I don’t think you have to wait five years. I think it could be next year when what you described becomes reality. We know national security agents are already in Hong Kong. They’re not operating openly but they’re here; we all know that. Will they start arresting people and taking them across to China? I don’t know. I wouldn’t want to make that kind of prediction, because a lot of people would have to leave Hong Kong.”Kwok continued, “There’s talk about whether the national security law will have retroactive consequences, but we don’t know. Because if there is going to be a retrospective effect of criminal sanctions, which is a breach of all human rights that we have in Hong Kong, this means Hong Kong people will be living in fear and will have to leave. Millions have protested or joined peaceful assemblies or said things on Facebook that could be used against them. So that will really drive fear through the whole community and there may be a mass exodus. I don’t know.”Another question is whether Hong Kong courts will oversee these laws or will they become the jurisdiction of harsh Chinese puppet courts, which are controlled by the CCP and where convictions for political offense are a foregone conclusion.Kwok fully expects to be barred from running in upcoming Legislative Council elections, if they go ahead, as part of a crackdown against pro-democracy candidates and leading lights. Once considered a moderate pro-democracy candidate, Beijing has blacklisted him.Participating in a webinar hosted by the Lowy Institute in Australia, Kwok complained that “they’re making this law in Beijing with almost zero input from people in Hong Kong, bypassing all our institutions and the Legislative Council”.He said China’s decision to impose this law on Hong Kong makes a mockery of One Country, Two Systems. “If they can enact laws like that, they won’t stop at national security. It’ll be national education next month and then something else the other ... Everyone in their right mind sees this as the end of One Country, Two Systems if they do it this way. I don’t have to tell you how they interpret national security in the Mainland.”Kwok lamented: “We all knew from the beginning that One Country, Two Systems is an inherent contradiction, and it will only work if there is respect between the two systems ... They have torn down that respect for difference and only emphasize One Country; you hear from Mainland officials saying all the time in the past few years that One Country trumps Two Systems. Now if they insist on that mentality, they are not only deviating from the original idea that was founded by Deng Xiaoping, but if there’s no respect for the two different systems, it’s never going to work.“We can see it now where they’re basically saying, ‘Enough is enough, our patience is running out, you’ve crossed the red line of the Central People’s Government’ ... but they never bother to think about the bottom line of the Hong Kong people.” Kwok was referring to the promise of universal suffrage when voting for the city’s leaders.“And now they even say to the international community that the Sino-British Joint Declaration is just a piece of paper, that there’s no obligation, no promise arising from it and that the British government should just back off. This is how they see their international obligation...”Indeed, China’s treatment and dismissal of a signed treaty deposited with the United Nations says a lot about its attitude to other formal commitments as well. For example, China eviscerated the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s decision on a case brought against it regarding Beijing’s excessive claims in the South China Sea.Kwok has no illusions as to the trustworthiness of his mother country. “China is showing its true colors to the world. Ten years ago they still paid lip service to human rights, the rule of law, but now they’re not paying lip service anymore. They’re saying, ‘This is who we are. If you don’t like it, get out of our way or, if not, we’re going to threaten you with consequences.”“The whole strategy of Beijing has changed,” Kwok declared.The USA is likely to enact sanctions and remove Hong Kong’s favored status. Many are encouraging countries like Australia, the UK and USA to open up ways for Hong Kong people to emigrate. However, the large wave of emigration from Hong Kong in the period leading up to the 1997 handover is unlikely. Kwok said, “A lot of people around me are thinking about having options, having an exit plan, but a lot of them don’t want to leave because it is not easy to leave your hometown.”Yet any country that does offer sanctuary must encounter bullying from China. “A lot of people are realizing this is the consequence of having an assertive global power which is an authoritarian regime ... You have to choose fighting for your values of democracy, freedom and rule of law ... You need to make a choice as a people and country.”As part of the media blitz bolstering Beijing’s plans, the Officer of the Commissioner of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on 25 May: “In short, here are five key messages. First, national security legislation for Hong Kong is right and proper and of greatest urgency. Second, it is just and legitimate for the Central Government to safeguard national security, which is both within its power and its obligation. Third, national security legislation will ensure the enduring success of ‘One Country, Two Systems’. Fourth, the international community can rest assured about the legislation for Hong Kong. And fifth, the Chinese government is rock-firm in upholding national sovereignty, security and development interests.”Lam and other Hong Kong leaders insist that ordinary citizens have nothing to fear from the law,but there is a curious irony in all this. She said, for example, “The legislation to be enacted for the HKSAR to safeguard national security aims to prevent, curb and sanction an extremely small minority of criminals who threaten national security, safeguarding the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and maintaining ‘One Country, Two Systems’. It will not affect the legitimate rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents.”Yet at the same time, Lam admits she has not seen the law nor knows any of its intimate details. Thus, she is reassuring everyone not to worry about a law that she knows nothing about. This is absurd, and simply reflects her toeing the party line.It needs to be asked, why now? Of course, with the NPC having met last month, this was the first opportunity for such a law to be tabled and rubberstamped.However, beyond that, two key reasons are likely. One is that the world is currently distracted by COVID-19, so there is less international scrutiny. The Chinese government is reluctant to let a good crisis go to waste, so Beijing obviously felt now was a good time to rush the bill through. Another factor is the steadily worsening US-China relationship, so China may as well do it now because there is not that much to lose given the current deterioration.With Legislative Council elections scheduled for September, Beijing is rightfully fearful of a defeat at the ballot boxes. It is thus doing all it can to regain a lead by arresting or disqualifying opponents, and the term “terrorist” is being freely applied to protestors. Luo Huining, renowned as a disciplinarian, took up the post of director of the Liaison Office in January, and he is exerting a strong hand too.Already, more than 9,000 protestors have been arrested since mid-2019, with more than 1,200 charged. Yet every time Beijing and the Hong Kong government un-glove their iron fist, it further deepens the divide that has beset society. Beijing does not understand that the more it squeezes Hong Kong, the more it crystallizes and solidifies resistance. What Beijing sought to eliminate - grassroots criticism and resistance to the CCP - it has single-handedly helped to instigate.China will be going all out to indoctrinate the new generation of Hong Kong youth too. It is already lining up teachers to go to there to sing the CCP’s praises and inculcate “patriotism”.The reality is that protestors are fighting a rear-guard action. They have little hope of stemming the inexorable tide of an incensed authoritarian China. Hong Kong’s exclusive connections with the West, and the people’s aspiration for greater autonomy, have turned it into a battlefield against Xi’s xenophobic policies.Xi has prioritized his nationalist and authoritarian agenda above Hong Kong’s value as a financial center. The territory has entered a countdown, never to be the same again. Xi no longer wants or needs it as a buffer zone, and instead he senses the danger of foreign ideas such as democracy diffusing from there into China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-fears-oblivion-under-chinese-dominion/story-usaakwy6v3Cr0d5LE1WgbO.html
10-06-2020||World||Kim Yo Jong emerges as policymaker in spat with South Korea||The sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is taking a leading role in a new, more hard-line pressure campaign against South Korea, highlighting what analysts say is a substantive policy role that goes beyond being her brother’s assistant.Believed to be in her early 30s, Kim Yo Jong is the only close relative of the North Korean leader to play a public role in politics. During the 2018-2019 flurry of international diplomacy, Kim Yo Jong garnered global attention by leading a delegation to the 2018 Winter Olympics in South Korea. Later, she was often seen dashing about to make sure everything went well for her older brother, including holding an ashtray for him at a train station on his way to a summit with U.S. President Donald Trump in Vietnam.But this year, Kim has taken on a more public policy role, cementing her status as an influential political player in her own right.“Prior to this, Kim Yo Jong was portrayed in state media as Kim Jong Un’s sister, his protocol officer, or one of his accompanying officials,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former North Korea open source intelligence analyst in the U.S. government. “Now, North Koreans know for sure there is more to her than that.”Kim has worked behind the scenes in North Korea’s propaganda agencies, a role that led the United States to add her to a list of sanctioned senior officials in 2017 because of human rights abuses and censorship.In March, state media carried the first ever statement by Kim, in which she criticised South Korean authorities. That was followed by several more, including a response to comments by Trump, and last week, a warning that the North would cut communications with South Korea.Lee said Kim’s statements have a unique style, showcasing her wit and underscoring her powerful position.“In addition to the harsh words and sarcasm, they can be bitingly witty in ways that the other statements are not,” Lee said. “She seems to have more leeway in crafting her statements, which of course is not surprising.”When state media announced on Tuesday that the hotlines between North and South Korea would be severed, they said Kim Yo Jong and a longtime hard-liner, Kim Yong Chol, championed the decision at a meeting.This rare explanation of a policymaking process portrayed Kim Yo Jong as “a very substantive person,” said Michael Madden, a North Korea leadership expert at the Stimson Centre, a U.S.-based think tank. Madden said this new portrayal of Kim in state media may be a subtle dig at international analysts who have cast doubts on her ability to wield influence in the North’s male-dominated society.“They clearly have high hopes and expectations for her,” he said. “Not necessarily the next leader, but something of a king maker nonetheless.” (Reporting by Josh Smith.

According to the Ministry of National Health Services, 83 more Covid-19 patients died during the same period, taking the death toll to 2,255 and 5,387 new patients were detected in the last 24 hours.A total of 36,308 patients have also recovered so far from the disease across the country, the ministry said.Out of the total 113,702 cases, Punjab has registered 43,460 patients, Sindh 41,303, Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa 14,527, Balochistan 7,031, Islamabad 5,963, Gilgit-Baltistan 974 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 444.The ministry said that 23,799 tests were done in the last 24 hours, taking the tally of total tests in the country to 754,252.The virus is spreading fast but the government has refused a proposal by the World Health Organisation to follow the “intermittent lockdown” policy of two-week lockdown followed by two-week relaxation on alternate basis. In a letter to Punjab province Health Minister Yasmin Rashid dated June 7, WHO Country Head, Pakistan, Dr Palitha Mahipala said the coronavirus has spread to almost all districts in the country with big cities making up the majority of the cases.Mahipala has recommended an “intermittent lockdown” approach.However, advisor on Health Zafar Mirza told the media that “no such policy is under consideration”.The WHO country head pointed out that after the partial relaxation on May 1, and complete relaxation on May 22 the infection rate has increased on both occasions.Pakistan had lifted the virus restrictions in view of an under-control rate of transmission and the health system’s ability to “detect, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-pakistan-records-highest-single-day-spike-of-5-387-cases/story-KY3ViEsLSwtUE0vh5mRWYM.html

US ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, “intends to resume operations in Wuhan in the near future”, Frank Witaker, minister counsellor for Public Affairs at the embassy, said in an email to Reuters, without giving a specific date.The US State Department withdrew consulate staff and their families in late January after the Chinese government put the city under lockdown to curb the spread of the virus. Wuhan, a central Chinese city with a population of about 11 million, has accounted for the majority of China’s coronavirus cases and deaths, though the epidemic has since subsided there and in other parts of the country.Since apparently jumping to people in a Wuhan market selling wildlife, the coronavirus has spread globally, infecting more than 7 million people and killing more than 410,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-consulate-in-china-s-wuhan-to-reopen-in-near-future/story-mhpFrYWcIGylevfSPcWuDL.html
10-06-2020||World||Sweden halts probe into 1986 murder of former Prime Minister Olof Palme||Sweden on Wednesday dropped its investigation into the unsolved murder of former Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, who was shot dead 34 years ago in downtown Stockholm.The case’s chief prosecutor, Krister Petersson, said the case was being closed because the main suspect, Stig Engstrom, had died in 2000.Palme was gunned down on Feb. 28, 1986, after he and his wife Lisbet Palme left a movie theater in the Swedish capital.Petersson said Engstrom, also known as the Skandiamannen for working in the nearby Skandia insurance company, had a strong dislike of Palme and his policies. He was one of the first at the murder scene and was briefly considered a possible suspect.“Since he has died, I cannot indict him,” Petersson told a news conference.Several other witnesses gave descriptions of the fleeing killer that matched Engstrom while others said he wasn’t even at the scene. Engstrom himself claimed to have been present from the beginning, spoke to Lisbet Palme and police, and attempted to resuscitate the victim.Soon after the murder, Engstrom appeared in Swedish media and developed an increasingly detailed story of his involvement in the events and criticized the police. He claimed those witnesses who had described the killer had in fact been describing him, running to catch up with police officers in pursuit of the assassin.The police then labelled Engstrom as a unreliable and inconsistent witness and classified him as a person of no interest.Palme sought to live as ordinary a life as possible and would often go out without any bodyguards. The night of the murder, he had no protection.Lisbet Palme was injured in the attack and later identified the shooter as Christer Pettersson, an alcoholic and drug addict, who was convicted of Palme’s murder. The sentence was later overturned after police failed to produce any technical evidence against him, leaving the murder an unsolved mystery. Pettersson died in 2004.Palme, who cut a flamboyant, even boyish figure, had an aristocratic background but was known for his left-leaning views. He was eyed with suspicion in conservative circles and by the United States. Among Swedes and in the Nordic region, he was much loved, but also hated.More than 100 people have been suspected of the crime and the unsolved case has been surrounded by conspiracy theories, ranging from foreign involvement, people with right-wing sympathies within Sweden’s police, to an act by a lone shooter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sweden-halts-probe-into-1986-murder-of-former-prime-minister-olof-palme/story-OiTVUY46866xu5zzCAq9CL.html

Adidas AG’s Reebok also said it would end its longtime sponsorship of the CrossFit Games after the event in 2020, according to Footwear News.Documented by cell phone video, Floyd’s death has sparked more than a week of demonstrations in more than 150 cities around the US, with protesters demanding deep reform to police practices that unfairly target black people. Protests have spread around the globe, with demonstrators from Australia and New Zealand to the United Kingdom and France are using the moment as a launching point to review their own countries’ histories of racial prejudice.The movement has also reverberated in corporate America, where many companies have signaled solidarity with the protesters. At the same time, several high-profile and senior executives have been fired or placed on leave in recent weeks, the result of growing intolerance for expressions of racism or evidence of bias. The ousters have so far been especially visible in media, with changes at the top of Bon Appetit, Refinery29, the Philadelphia Inquirer, Variety and the New York Times Opinion section.The entertainment industry, still reeling from the widespread sexual harassment scandals that brought some of Hollywood’s most powerful players, is now auditing its content -- and the people who make it.Television networks and streaming services are now reconsidering some popular classics. Netflix and the BBC pulled reruns of sketch comedy show “Little Britain” over its repeated use of blackface. HBO Max removed “Gone With the Wind,” Variety reported, though the Oscar-winning Civil War epic may later return with a note attached to explain controversies over the 1939 film’s rosy portrayal of slavery. Paramount Network canceled the long-running police reality show “Cops.”Meanwhile, four cast members from Bravo’s reality show, “The Vanderpump Rules,” have been fired, CNN reported. The CEO and co-owner of The Second City Chicago acknowledged an institutional legacy of racism at the influential comedy outpost and resigned. Hartley Sawyer, who played the Elongated Man on CW’s superhero show “The Flash,” was fired for tweets the actor later acknowledged were “hurtful and unacceptable,” according to the BBC.Glassman’s DownfallGlassman’s fall started with a June 6 reply to an Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation tweet calling racism a critical public health issue. Glassman, whose Twitter handle is @CrossFitCEO, commented on Saturday, “It’s FLOYD-19,” then went on from there.CrossFit franchisees and customers from around the US decried the sentiments as tone-deaf. The account @CrossFitFresno replied, “As a 10+ year @CrossFit affiliate that is coming out of 3 months of business closure, we are already struggling. How could you do this to your brand that we pay to be affiliated with? Please help us understand.”Glassman hasn’t tweeted since. Dave Castro was named as new CEO.CrossFit is a brand of fitness regimen that incorporates weightlifting and aerobic exercise and has spawned at least 15,000 affiliate gyms worldwide. Its vast appeal and popularity was so widespread that the company created the CrossFit Games in 2007, an annual televised competition where athletes compete for more than $2.3 million in prize money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crossfit-ceo-latest-to-be-ousted-amid-america-s-racial-reckoning/story-UwfIOuhNEeuQqtCasAQfBM.html

10-06-2020||World||United States: Two men say hospital switched them at birth 80 years ago||Two men who believe they were switched at birth nearly 80 years ago are suing a Roman Catholic diocese in West Virginia, alleging negligence and breach of duty by the hospital where they were born. John William Carr III and Jackie Lee Spencer were born on August 29, 1942, at St. Joseph Hospital in Buckhannon. The lawsuit against the Diocese of Wheeling-Charleston says hospital staffers sent them home with the wrong families, The Dominion Post reported Monday. The switch was discovered last year when DNA tests showed Carr and Spencer had no genetic matches with the families that raised them but did match the other’s family, the men say in their lawsuit. Carr, Spencer and their families have suffered a “lifetime of consequences” from the switch and are seeking unspecified damages, they say in the lawsuit. The diocese does not comment on pending litigation, spokesperson Tim Bishop said. Spencer spent more than 50 years searching for the man listed on his birth certificate as his father, he says in the lawsuit. He had been told the man abandoned his mother prior to his birth. After finding relatives of the man, Spencer took a DNA test to see if he was related and discovered he was not. An additional DNA test also showed he wasn’t related to people he had grown up thinking of as blood family. It turned out, tests showed, he was really related to Carr’s family — and further digging found that Carr had been born the same day at St. Joseph. Spencer and his wife contacted Carr, who took a DNA test that showed he was related to the people Spencer had believed were relatives. Spencer, now in his twilight years, never got to know many of his family members, he says in the lawsuit. “Many of the people Jack should have known his entire life are gone,” according to the suit. “He feels as though most of his family died all at once. He grieves for the loss of the life he was supposed to have, while reconciling those feeling with the love and gratitude he feels for the family he has known his whole life.” Carr, who has blue eyes, said he looks different from the family that raised him and always felt out of place. “Well, I never felt like I fit in here because my mother and dad had brown hair and brown eyes, and so do my brother and sister,” Carr said in the lawsuit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-two-men-say-hospital-switched-them-at-birth-80-years-ago/story-0Nha2YXq6mDqENTkkSkAmO.html

According to CNN report, Cecil Rhodes was one of the leading figures in British imperialism at the end of the 19th Century, pushing the empire to seize control over vast areas of southern Africa, first as a businessman and later as prime minister of Cape Colony in what is now South Africa.Meanwhile, nearly, two weeks after his death in Police Custody, Family and friends honoured George Floyd at a private funeral in the US city of Houston. Floyd’s casket was rolled into the church by six men wearing black suits and masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protesters-in-oxford-demand-removal-of-statue-of-cecil-rhodes/story-CbBuJR3XbYDJ69bl3JRyVN.html
10-06-2020||World||9 countries including New Zealand are now Covid-19 free. Here’s the list||As the world continues to grapple with coronavirus pandemic with the infections crossing the seven million mark and over 400,000 deaths due to Covid-19, at least nine countries have declared themselves to be free from the virus.Here is a list of these nations:1. New ZealandOn June 8, New Zealand announced that the last of its coronavirus patients had recovered with its health officials saying there were no active cases of Covid-19 in the country. The Pacific island nation reported just over 1500 corona patients including 22 who died.The country had enforced a strict lockdown for nearly seven weeks, in which most businesses were shut and everyone except essential workers had to stay at home.Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced lifting of all coronavirus measures in the country from June 9, barring border closure restrictions.2. TanzaniaTanzania’s president on Sunday claimed that his country is free of the coronavirus because of the power of prayer. However, the claim came six weeks after the African nation stopped publicly updating virus data.“Corona in our country has been removed by the powers of God,” President John Magufuli declared at a church service on Sunday.Tanzania’s number of-19 cases has been stuck at 509 for six weeks as health officials, opposition figures and some neighbouring countries worry that cases in the East African nation continue to climb. Opposition figures have estimated that cases could be in the tens of thousands.3. VaticanThe Vatican said on June 6 that there were no more cases of Covid-19 within its population after all its 12 patients recovered. The Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said in a statement that the last person found to have been infected with the coronavirus in recent weeks had tested negative. The city state did not report any deaths. A day later, Pope Francis addressed the faithful for the first time in Saint Peter’s Square since the health emergency began.4.FijiFiji declared itself free of coronavirus in the first week of June after all 18 people who had tested positive recovered from Covid-19. Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama said Friday that the South Pacific island nation had just cleared the last of its active patients.He wrote on Twitter: “And even with our testing numbers climbing by the day, it’s now been 45 days since we recorded our last case. With no deaths, our recovery rate is 100%” He added: “Answered prayers, hard work, and affirmation of science!” Fiji, which has a population of 900,000, imposed a lockdown in certain areas in April and put in place ongoing border restrictions. 5.MontenegroSixty nine days after its first reported Covid-19 case, Montenegro declared itself coronavirus free on May 24, the first European country to do so.

The residential building in Karachi’s Lyari area collapsed on Sunday night. The residents of the building said the six-storey structure collapsed with a loud “thud”, which was followed by a power outage making rescue operations difficult. Till Monday, rescue teams had pulled out eight bodies and on Tuesday 11 more bodies were found in the first floor of the collapsed building. Twelve people were injured in the incident.A man, who was rescued alive from the rubble after 24 hours, died due to his injuries in the hospital, Geo TV reported. Personnel from the Army, Rangers, police and welfare associations were engaged in the rescue operation. The building, located in Liaquat Colony of Lyari, had more than 40 apartments and a penthouse on the top floor. The Sindh Building Control Authority (SBCA) had declared it as dangerous and unstable more than two months ago.Meanwhile, Pakistan Peoples Party Chairman Bilawal Bhutto Zardari expressed regret over the loss of lives in the incident.“I am with the affected families, we will not leave them alone in these difficult times,” Bilawal said.This is the third major building collapse in the country’s financial capital this year. In March, 27 people were killed and scores injured when a five-storey building fell on two adjacent structures in the city’s congested Gulbahar area.Karachi city authorities have identified over 1,500 buildings as ‘dangerous’, however little action has been taken to evacuate them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-in-the-pakistan-building-collapse-increases-to-19/story-67XucVXX6pfphMgnu6lNDO.html
10-06-2020||World||Kim Jong Un raises pressure on South Korea to split with Trump||Both North Korea and left-leaning supporters of South Korean President Moon Jae-in want him to restore economic ties broken by security tensions. But pleasing them would mean angering US President Donald Trump.On Tuesday, North Korea said it was closing down communication links set up two years ago between Moon and Kim Jong Un, jeopardizing the South Korean leader’s 2017 campaign promise to move the heavily armed rivals toward a permanent peace. It’s bad timing for Moon: His ruling bloc secured a historic supermajority in National Assembly elections in April, boosting calls within his Democratic Party to mend ties with North Korea.The problem for Moon is that he doesn’t have much he can offer North Korea without prompting a blowup from the Trump administration, which has repeatedly rejected South Korea’s calls for sanctions relief. The US has refused to relax United Nations penalties and other measures against the regime without greater commitments on arms reduction from Kim.Woo Won-shik, a senior lawmaker and a former Democratic Party floor leader, said Tuesday there was an “urgent need” to revive inter-Korean cooperation, arguing that failure to act now could further isolate North Korea and bring about a return to the brinkmanship of three years ago. Kim earlier this year said he would soon debut a “new strategic weapon” -- part of a bid to pressure Trump, who faces an election in November, back to the negotiating table.“There are many inter-Korean projects that can proceed without breaching the existing UN sanctions regime,” Woo said.The latest dust-up -- triggered by South Korean activists who sent anti-Pyongyang messages in balloons across the border -- comes ahead of the 20th anniversary of the first meeting between top leaders of the divided Koreas. The summit beginning on June 13, 2000, was the biggest moment of then-President Kim Dae-jung’s reconciliation effort that led to stepped up trade and joint projects and helped earn the South Korean leader the Nobel Peace Prize.While that “Sunshine Policy” helped cool tensions, it was also criticized for providing Pyongyang’s leaders with cash needed to build up its nuclear weapons program. Smaller measures that might allow only a trickle of foreign currency back into cash-starved North Korea also risk disappointing Kim Jong Un and Moon’s allies, who see their current strength in parliament as their best chance to secure lasting change.North Korea’s relations with Moon haven’t been the same since Trump walked out of a summit with Kim in February 2019 in Hanoi. The North Korean leader was pushing a plan backed by Seoul to give up his antiquated Yongbyon nuclear facility in exchange for sanctions relief -- an offer that came nowhere near the Trump administration’s demand for the “final, fully verified denuclearization of North Korea.”“It is a sense of betrayal and disappointment,” said Rachel Minyoung Lee, a former analyst for the US government specializing in North Korea. “Kim Jong Un feels South Korea has misled him into believing that Yongbyon facilities were going to be enough for a deal with Trump in Hanoi.”After that, North Korea has effectively ignored Moon’s requests for talks, shunned his offers for aid and test-launched new ballistic missiles capable of carrying a nuclear payload to all parts of South Korea, where about 28,500 US military personnel are stationed.North Korea didn’t answer South Korea’s calls made on the military line Tuesday for the first time since the inter-Korean communication link was restored in 2018, defense ministry spokeswoman Choi Hyun-soo told a briefing in Seoul. “Inter-Korean communication lines are a basic means for communication and should be kept in line with inter-Korean agreements,” South Korea’s Unification Ministry said in a text message to reporters.A State Department spokesperson said the US urges North Korea to return to diplomacy and cooperation. “The United States has always supported progress in inter-Korean relations, and we are disappointed in the DPRK’s recent actions,” the spokesperson said, referring to North Korea by its formal name.Kim Jong Un may follow up his move to cut communications links with more missile tests, but making sure to avoid the wrath of Trump. The American president has brushed off shorter-range tests and credited his own diplomacy for stopping Kim from further tests of intercontinental ballistic missiles capable of hitting the US mainland.“Provocations like missile launches will follow, but nothing as serious as an ICBM test,” said Cho Han-bum, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification, a state-run think tank. Cho added that North Korea also didn’t want to push Moon too far: “The South is well aware that ending the inter-Korean relations is not something that the North wants.”Moon’s government said in late May said that it wanted to try to again ease travel restrictions and inter-Korean exchanges. A similar attempt in 2018 led Trump to bluntly tell Seoul that it couldn’t do anything regarding sanctions “without our approval.”Alliance at RiskMembers of the Moon administration have hinted that Seoul could act unilaterally to resuscitate inter-Korean cooperation, but that would come with the enormous risk of cleaving Seoul from its alliance with Washington, said Soo Kim, a Rand Corp. policy analyst who specializes in Korean Peninsula issues.“President Moon can promise the North Koreans the earth, but realistically, he remains constrained in the way of practical measures South Korea can take -- if Seoul were to be conscious of and concerned about its relations with the US,” she said.South Korean proposals blocked by the Trump administration included resuming operations at a joint factory park in the North Korean border city of Kaesong and a separate resort at North Korea’s Mount Kumgang. Both were opened in the spirit of the Sunshine Policy and later shut due to political turmoil.While South Korea was able to win a UN sanctions waiver that led to the ceremonial sending of trains across the border about two years ago, its humanitarian assistance has dried up under Trump’s maximum pressure campaign. South Korea has sent more $3 billion of aid since 1995, but little of it has come under the Moon government, which sent just $12 million in 2017 and 2018, government data shows.‘Bent Over Backwards’Trade between the two nations has dropped to virtually zero from $2.7 billion in 2015, or about 10% of North Korea’s economy. The regime took a further hit this year when it sealed off its borders in January at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, which slammed the brakes on other trade with countries like China.Kim Jong Un believes he doesn’t have much of anything to lose by increasing pressure on Moon, according to Duyeon Kim, a senior adviser for Northeast Asia and Nuclear Policy at the International Crisis Group.“North Korea is raising the ante, trying to further punish, scare, and force Seoul to work harder to meet Pyongyang’s demands,” Kim said. “Kim Jong Un feels he bent over backwards for Moon, but believes Seoul has not reciprocated, has betrayed North Korea and the Korean race, and has no influence over Washington to deliver on its promises.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-raises-pressure-on-south-korea-to-split-with-trump/story-Uc7HEyxqDo7ylr15ytGjiM.html
10-06-2020||World||George Floyd death: New York moves towards eliminating police secrecy law||New York lawmakers striving for a new era of police accountability are poised to repeal a state law that has long kept police officers’ disciplinary records secret, one of several steps to rein in officers spurred by the national uproar over the death of George Floyd.As the state legislature worked toward eliminating the law Tuesday, New York City prosecutors moved swiftly to bring criminal charges against a police officer caught on camera shoving a protester to the ground during a demonstration in Brooklyn.Police unions declared that officers were being abandoned, and condemned lawmakers for allowing themselves to be influenced by protests in which officers were injured by thrown objects and police vehicles were burned.Eliminating the law, known as Section 50-a, would make complaints against officers, as well as transcripts and final dispositions of disciplinary proceedings, public for the first time in decades.Governer Andrew Cuomo, who has recently supported reforming the law, has said in the wake of the protests that he will sign the repeal. Only Delaware has a similar law.Momentum for ending the secrecy law reached a crescendo in recent days as marchers filled streets in Brooklyn, Manhattan and elsewhere to rally against police abuses — amplifying the calls of reform advocates who spent years pushing for change in the wake of other high-profile police killings, including that of Eric Garner in 2014.“This is no time for rejoicing,” said State Senator Kevin Parker, a Democrat representing parts of Brooklyn. “This bill has been around for over a decade … And the only reason why we’re bringing it to the floor now because the nation is burning.” The legislature on Monday passed other police accountability measures, banning police from using chokeholds, guaranteeing the right to record police activity and making it easier to file lawsuits against people making race-based 911 calls.State lawmakers Tuesday were also expected to pass bills providing all state troopers with body cameras and ensuring that officers get proper medical and mental health attention for people under arrest or in custody.As lawmakers acted on accountability legislation, NYPD Officer Vincent D’Andraia was being arraigned on assault and other charges days after a bystander recorded him pushing protester Dounya Zayer, causing her to hit her head on the pavement.D’Andraia was released after his lawyer entered a not guilty plea on his behalf. The officer was ordered to stay away from Zayer who was hospitalized after the May 29 altercation with what she said were a concussion and a seizure.“Dounya was assaulted for the very reason she was protesting, and that’s police brutality,” said Zayer’s attorney, Tahanie Aboushi, adding that D’Andraia’s supervisor should face punishment beyond an announced reassignment.“If not for this being on video it would have been business as usual for the NYPD,” Aboushi said.In a statement announcing the charges, Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez said he was “deeply troubled by this unnecessary assault.” Zayer, 20, called D’Andraia a coward and suggested the assault would only deepen mistrust of law enforcement.“I was protesting for a reason,” Zayer said in a video tweeted from her hospital bed. The officer, she added, “should have had the self restraint to not hurt the people he’s supposed to be protecting.” The police department suspended D’Andraia, 28, last week without pay. His lawyer, Stephen Worth, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. If convicted, he could face a year behind bars, but first-time offenders rarely see any jail time.D’Andraia is the first New York City police officer to face criminal charges over alleged misconduct exhibited during days of unrest that roiled the city in the wake of Floyd’s death in Minneapolis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-floyd-death-new-york-moves-towards-eliminating-police-secrecy-law/story-5MUfGfKdT5yzfGHAsWWJhP.html
10-06-2020||World||Senate confirms Gen Charles Brown Jr as first black US military service chief in unanimous vote||The Senate on Tuesday unanimously confirmed Gen. Charles Brown Jr. as chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, making him the first black officer to lead one of the nation’s military services.Vice President Mike Pence took the unusual step of presiding over the vote, something he usually does to break ties. But Brown’s confirmation, 98-0, was not close. Pence called the moment “historic.”The vote came as the Trump administration and the mostly white Senate Republican conference grapple with the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd in police custody in Minneapolis. Protests have convulsed the nation alongside the coronavirus pandemic, with racial discrimination being the common thread between them. The vote in Washington overlapped with Floyd’s funeral in Houston.Brown most recently served as the commander of U.S. Pacific Air Forces. He is a fighter pilot, with more than 2,900 flying hours, including 130 in combat.He posted a video on social media Friday describing a lifetime of dealing with racial bias and the struggle to fit in to a predominantly white society.“I’m thinking about my Air Force career where I was often the only African American in my squadron or, as a senior officer, the only African American in the room,” he said in a raw tone. “I’m thinking about wearing the same flight suit with the same wings on my chest as my peers and being questioned by another military member: ‘Are you a pilot?’”Brown was commissioned in 1984 as a distinguished graduate of the ROTC program at Texas Tech University.He has served in a variety of positions at the squadron and wing levels, and commanded a fighter squadron and two fighter wings. He also was an F-16 instructor at the U.S. Air Force Weapons School.The military, with African Americans making up a little over 17% of its active-duty ranks, is more racially diverse than the country, which is 13% African American, according to 2019 Census estimates. The Army is the most diverse with more than 21% African Americans, while the Marine Corp is the least, with 10%. Blacks make up about 17% of the Navy and less than 15% of the Air Force.But there is a much greater racial divide within the active-duty military based on rank.Nineteen percent of active-duty enlisted troops are black, but they make up only 9% of the officer corps. Of those, there are just 71 who are general or flag officers, wearing one to four stars, including only two who have attained the top four-star rank.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/senate-confirms-gen-charles-brown-jr-as-first-black-us-military-service-chief-in-unanimous-vote/story-HxVqTlUr1mZuMw6fsSXk0J.html
10-06-2020||World||‘He is going to change the world’: Funeral held for George Floyd||George Floyd was fondly remembered Tuesday as “Big Floyd” — a father and brother, athlete and neighbourhood mentor, and now a catalyst for change — at a funeral for the black man whose death has sparked a global reckoning over police brutality and racial prejudice.More than 500 mourners wearing masks against the coronavirus packed a Houston church a little more than two weeks after Floyd was pinned to the pavement by a white Minneapolis police officer who put a knee on his neck for what prosecutors said was 8 minutes and 46 seconds.Cellphone video of the encounter, including Floyd’s pleas of “I can’t breathe,” ignited protests and scattered violence across the U.S. and around the world, turning the 46-year-old Floyd — a man who in life was little known beyond the public housing project where he was raised in Houston’s Third Ward — into a worldwide symbol of injustice.“Third Ward, Cuney Homes, that’s where he was born at,” Floyd’s brother, Rodney, told mourners at the Fountain of Praise church. “But everybody is going to remember him around the world. He is going to change the world.”The funeral capped six days of mourning for Floyd in three cities: Raeford, North Carolina, near where he was born; Houston, where he grew up; and Minneapolis, where he died. The memorials have drawn the families of other black victims whose names have become familiar in the debate over race and justice — among them, Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Ahmaud Arbery and Trayvon Martin.After the service, Floyd’s golden casket was taken by hearse to the cemetery in the Houston suburb of Pearland where he was to be entombed next to his mother, for whom he cried out as he lay dying. A mile from the graveyard, the casket was transferred to a glass-sided carriage drawn by a pair of white horses. A brass band played as his casket was taken inside the mausoleum.Hundreds of people, some chanting, “Say his name, George Floyd,” gathered along the procession route and outside the cemetery entrance in the mid-90s heat.“I don’t want to see any black man, any man, but most definitely not a black man sitting on the ground in the hands of bad police,” said Marcus Brooks, 47, who set up a tent with other graduates of Jack Yates High School, Floyd’s alma mater.In the past two weeks, amid the furor over Floyd’s death, sweeping and previously unthinkable things have taken place: Confederate statues have been toppled, and many cities are debating overhauling, dismantling or cutting funding for police departments. Authorities in some places have barred police from using chokeholds or are otherwise rethinking policies on the use of force.Dozens of Floyd’s family members, most dressed in white, took part in the four-hour service. Grammy-winning singer Ne-Yo was among those who sang.The mourners included actors Jamie Foxx and Channing Tatum, J.J. Watt of the NFL’s Houston Texans, rapper Trae tha Truth, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, Houston Police Chief Art Acevedo and Houston Mayor Sylvester Turner, who brought the crowd to its feet when he announced he will sign an executive order banning chokeholds in the city.“I know you have a lot of questions that no child should have to ask, questions that too many black children have had to ask for generations: Why? Why is Daddy gone?” former Vice President Joe Biden, the Democratic presidential candidate, said, addressing Floyd’s 6-year-old daughter in a video eulogy played at the service. “Now is the time for racial justice. That’s the answer we must give to our children when they ask why.”Biden made no mention of his opponent in November. But other speakers took swipes at President Donald Trump, who has ignored demands to address racial bias and has called on authorities to crack down hard on lawlessness.“The president talks about bringing in the military, but he did not say one word about 8 minutes and 46 seconds of police murder of George Floyd,” said the Rev. Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist. “He challenged China on human rights. But what about the human right of George Floyd?”Most of the pews were full, with relatively little space between people.“So much for social distancing today,” the Rev. Remus Wright told mourners, gently but firmly instructing those attending to wear face masks.Texas has no limit on how many people can gather in places of worship during the pandemic, though Republican Gov. Greg Abbott has encouraged churches to follow federal health guidelines.Although the church service was private, at least 50 people gathered outside to pay their respects.“There’s a real big change going on, and everybody, especially black, right now should be a part of that,” said Kersey Biagase, who traveled more than three hours from Port Barre, Louisiana, with his girlfriend, Brandi Pickney. They wore T-shirts printed with Floyd’s name and “I Can’t Breathe.”Floyd served nearly five years in prison for robbery with a deadly weapon before becoming a mentor and a church outreach volunteer in Houston. He moved to Minnesota several years ago through a program that tried to change men’s lives by helping them find work in new settings.At the time of his death, Floyd was out of work as a bouncer at a Minneapolis club that had closed because of the coronavirus outbreak. He was seized by police after being accused of passing a counterfeit $20 bill at a convenience store.Four Minneapolis officers were arrested in his death: Derek Chauvin, 44, was charged with second-degree murder. J. Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane and Tou Thao were charged with aiding and abetting. All four could get up to 40 years in prison.Some of the mostly peaceful demonstrations that erupted after Floyd’s death were marked by bursts of arson, assaults, vandalism and smash-and-grab raids on businesses, with more than 10,000 people arrested. But protests in recent days have been overwhelmingly peaceful.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/he-is-going-to-change-the-world-funeral-held-for-george-floyd/story-R464nysMhGiirFITbvoGZJ.html
10-06-2020||World||4.6 unemployed workers for each job opening in US amid Covid-19 pandemic||US employers laid off 7.7 million workers in April — a sign of just how deep the economic hole is after the closure of thousands of offices, restaurants, stores and schools during the pandemic.The Labor Department also said in a Tuesday report that job openings plummeted and hiring all but disappeared in April. The number of available jobs fell 16% from March, to 5 million. Hires declined 31% to 3.5 million.The grim April — which followed an even bleaker March with 11.5 million layoffs — suggests that the economy could take time to recover nearly a decade’s worth of gains that vanished in about 60 days. Hiring did rebound in May as 2.5 million jobs were added on net, the government said in a separate report Friday. But those gains appeared to reflect temporarily laid-off employees returning to work and increases in people with part-time jobs, rather than an economy at full throttle.The Tuesday report shows how employers responded quickly to the pandemic by furloughing or laying off workers in March, though that slowed the following month as consumer spending appeared to bottom out and even recover slightly. The Job Openings and Labor Turnover survey, or JOLTS, details overall hiring and job separation figures, while the monthly jobs data reflects net changes.The next several months could be a challenge as monthly hiring was only at 60% of 2019’s average. There are 4.6 unemployed workers for each job opening, meaning it will likely take time for the economy to return to its pre-coronavirus health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-6-unemployed-workers-for-each-job-opening-in-us-amid-covid-19-pandemic/story-Eg36W3iQDlbSOAcTEA4dWM.html
10-06-2020||World||Donald Trump’s 2020 path gets trickier with US formally in recession||President Donald Trump faces a new obstacle to his case for re-election -- the U.S. is now officially in recession.The “recession” label, made official on Monday, cements the pain that many voters are already feeling from the economy -- and will feed into their choice in November for who will be able to steer the economy back.For Democrat Joe Biden, the proclamation from the National Bureau of Economic Research is further evidence that the economy was on shaky ground even before the worst of the coronavirus hit. Trump, he said, has “squandered” the booming economy he inherited from President Barack Obama and himself.For Trump, the recession declaration came on the first weekday after the May jobs report showed 2.5 million jobs were created and the unemployment rate declined when it was expected to jump. On Friday he touted the numbers as a sign of “the greatest comeback in American history.”For now, the recession comes as polls show the president’s standing slipping across the board with the country reeling from the pandemic, its economic impact and racial justice protests. Trump is hoping to regain his footing by relaunching his signature rallies in the coming weeks where he will tout his economic record.And, while ignoring the recession announcement on his Twitter feed, Trump is maintaining his re-election argument that he built the strong economy once, and he can do it again.“TRANSITION TO GREATNESS!” he tweeted Tuesday, followed by, “THE REAWAKENING OF AMERICA!”Biden, for his part, argues that as vice president in 2009 he inherited the recession that began under Republican George W. Bush. He says he led the recovery efforts that began the economic expansion that ended in February and that he can do it again, this time as president.A CNN poll released Monday shows voters still give Trump the edge over Biden in managing the economy, 51% to 46%, even though Biden is leading the race by 14 points.The NBER, the official scorekeeper of when business cycles begin and end, said Monday that the recovery that began under Obama concluded its record 128-month run in February.But the committee also suggested that it may not last, noting that the pandemic has “resulted in a downturn with different characteristics and dynamics than prior recessions.” But there can be no mistake it’s a recession, the committee said, given the “unprecedented magnitude” and “broad reach” of the job losses.Trump spent most of his presidency taking credit for the booming economy, and now Biden is hanging the recession around his neck.“The president isn’t responsible for the virus,” Biden said in a statement. “But he is responsible for a completely bungled response that not only cost thousands of lives, but millions more jobs than should have been lost.“That’s on Donald Trump. It did not have to be this way,” he said.In fact, the timing of the announcement could actually help Trump.“Usually, the recession is over before they declare that it started,” said Princeton University economist Alan Blinder, a former Federal Reserve vice chairman appointed by President Bill Clinton. The more quickly the economy reaches the bottom, the more quickly it can begin to recover.The economy could be in recovery now, he said, meaning that it would likely be official by Election Day. But that doesn’t mean overall employment and economic output will be back to their pre-Covid levels.“If you fall down 17 flights of stairs and climb back up three, you’re in recovery,” Blinder said. “But you’re still 14 flights down from where you started.”Trump campaign spokesman Andrew Clark made clear that Trump will continue to run on the economy, recession notwithstanding.“Biden’s pathetic attempt to argue that the economy was in free fall before the coronavirus is a lie,” he said. “Before the global pandemic, the U.S. economy was delivering explosive wage growth for U.S. workers – including black workers and others who had been left behind when Biden was vice president – and job growth was smashing expectations.”Job growth and household incomes have the most direct effect on presidential approval ratings — not whether economists say there’s a recession. But recession dates are important to economic historians, who generally believe that Democratic presidents have been better for the economy than Republicans.That’s the conclusion of an analysis by Blinder and his Princeton colleague Mark Watson. Since Harry Truman’s election in 1948, Democratic presidents have spent an average of one quarter in recession for each term in office. Republicans have spent an average of 4.5 quarters in recession.Other economists and have noted that Congress and the Federal Reserve have as much control over the economy, and that decisions taken by one president can continue to affect the economy long after they’ve left office.All that might not matter much to voters, who tend to hold the president responsible for the economy.“There’s a lot of stuff that’s out of the control of the president that influences these things,” said Christopher Wlezien, a University of Texas professor who studies public opinion and the economy. “And voters don’t always discount that stuff.”(Added Alan Blinder comments beginning in 14th paragraph.)For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2020 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-2020-path-gets-trickier-with-u-s-formally-in-recession/story-qVG5Stln8gShhfAluBFHqL.html
10-06-2020||World||WHO warns Covid-19 is worsening||The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic has been worsening globally and now is not the time for any country to “take its foot off the pedal”, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has said, citing what he said was the highest number of new cases seen in a day by the health agency. More than 136,000 new cases were reported worldwide on Sunday, the most in a single day so far, and nearly 75% of them were reported from 10 countries, mostly in the Americas and South Asia, WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told an online briefing on Monday.“Although the situation in Europe is improving, globally it is worsening. More than 100,000 cases have been reported on nine of the past 10 days. Yesterday, more than 136,000 cases were reported - the most in a single day so far,” said Tedros. “More than six months into the pandemic, this is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal”.Brazil, India, Russia, Chile, Pakistan, Peru and Mexico account for the highest number of cases after the US, which has continued to add the most number of new cases for close to a month. WHO’s tally of cases are based on numbers that are reported to it by member countries. According to data sources used by HT, which include worldometer.info and the Coronavirus Resource Centre by Johns Hopkins University, the highest number of new cases was recorded at a little over 130,000 on Friday.For the past two days, these set of countries added more than half of the daily new cases to the global tally. The larger Asian and South American regions contributed more than 76% of Monday’s new cases, becoming drivers of what may loosely be seen as a third spurt in the outbreak’s spread: the first was propelled by infections in China in late January. The second spike was driven by European countries such as Italy and Spain beginning in April.The outbreak in the US coincided with the second spike, and the country has continued to remain at the top of the list of nations with the most number of new cases. As of Monday, the US accounted for 2 million of the over 7 million total infections. Brazil, where the outbreak began accelerating in May, now has the third highest number of cases at close to 700,000 cases. Among countries with large populations, the UK has the highest ratio of deaths per million people - 597 - followed by Spain (580) and Italy (561). WHO chief Tedros said that in countries where the situation was improving, “the biggest threat is now complacency”, adding that “most people globally are still susceptible to infection”.Experts also said that removing lockdown measures in these countries, which largely comprise of low-to-middle income countries (LMIC), would be dangerous. “Politicians may be desperate to get their economies going again, but that could be at the expense of having huge numbers of people die,” news agency Associated Press quoted Dr Bharat Pankhania, an infectious diseases expert at the University of Exeter in Britain as saying.He also said reimposing recently lifted lockdown measures was equally dangerous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-covid-19-is-worsening/story-0Y7M4GAHjkUjmu2fuOcGNL.html

And we are going to make the world know that he made a difference,” Al Green, the local US congressman, told the congregation.“We have a responsibility to each one of them to make sure that we do not walk away today after having celebrated his life and not taking the next step... to assure the future generations that this won’t happen again,” he added.Floyd died on May 25 as a white Minneapolis officer pressed a knee into his neck for almost nine minutes, his pleas of “I can’t breathe” becoming a rallying cry for protesters.His death has come to embody fractured relations between communities of color and police in the US and beyond as tens of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets.The Fountain of Praise was the final stage in a series of ceremonies paying tribute to Floyd before he is buried.In a day that capped more than two weeks of tension around the country, the theme inside the building was one of peace and hope as family members and friends took to the podium to share their grief, with civil rights leader the Reverend Al Sharpton due to deliver the eulogy.Flowers were piled high outside the entrance to the church, attended by part of his family, before a portrait of Floyd whose open casket was visited by more than 6,000 well-wishers on Monday.Some 500 guests -- all masked due the coronavirus pandemic -- filled the church, including actors Channing Tatum and Jamie Foxx, as well as boxing champion Floyd Mayweather who is reportedly paying all expenses. ‘Justice in America’ Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden, who has visited the family, offered words of condolence to Floyd’s children in a video message urging them to “change the world for the better” in their father’s name.“Today now is the time, the purpose, the season to listen and heal,” said Biden, who suffered his own tragedy with the deaths of a wife and two children.“Now is time for racial justice... Because when there’s justice for George Floyd we will truly be on our way to racial justice in America.”The funeral comes after the Minneapolis authorities pledged to dismantle and rebuild the police department in the city where Floyd died during an arrest for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 bill.Derek Chauvin, the 44-year-old white officer who was filmed pressing his knee on the handcuffed Floyd’s neck, faces up to 40 years if convicted on charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.His bail was set on Monday at $1 million with conditions, or $1.25 million without.Three other policemen involved in Floyd’s arrest are charged with aiding and abetting his murder. All four officers have been fired.The arrest was caught on amateur video played in all corners of the world over the past two weeks.Tough line from Trump Floyd was born in North Carolina, but grew up in Houston’s predominantly African American Third Ward where he was remembered as a towering high school athlete and good-natured friend.Demonstrators have taken to the streets for two weeks of the most sweeping US protests for racial justice since the 1968 assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.The demonstrations have been marred by several nights of violence that focused attention at home and abroad on police brutality as numerous videos have emerged that allegedly show incidents of heavy-handed policing. The Democrats have introduced legislation in both chambers of Congress, that they hope will make it easier to prosecute officers for abuse, and rethink how they are recruited and trained.Some US cities have already begun to embrace reforms -- starting with bans on the use of tear gas and rubber bullets. But it is unclear what support the reform bill might find in the Republican-controlled Senate -- or whether President Donald Trump would sign such legislation into law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-for-racial-justice-says-joe-biden-in-video-message-at-george-floyd-s-funeral/story-cQD9jS1vIrpDrIIXaOZpjO.html
10-06-2020||India||Kerala govt faces criticism for nod to hydel project||Thiruvananthapuram: Environment activists have criticised the Kerala government’s decision to renew the no-objection certificate for a proposed hydroelectric project near the picturesque Athirapally waterfall in Thrissur district.Even the Communist Party of India (CPI), a junior partner in Kerala’s Left Front government, has opposed the move even though the state administration says all stakeholders will be consulted in taking the project forward.Supporters of the project say it will not cause any harm to the waterfall and the ecology in the area, but critics suspect damage to environment, inundation of large tracts of land and displacement of tribal families residing in the area.The project, on the 145-km Chalakudy River, was conceived in the 1980s when the state was hit by power shortage, but was shelved due to stiff opposition. It was revived when the Pinarayi Vijayan government came to power in 2016. If set up, the project near Athirapally, a favourite movie shooting destination, will have an installed capacity of 163 megawatts and spread across 6.7km. The dam for water storage, particularly, has emerged as a cause for concern.“Chalakudi river already has many big and small dams. It can’t withstand more. Preventing natural course and storing water led to many disasters in the past. In Chalakudy, we don’t want pristine forests to be submerged and many tribals evacuated,” said VS Vijayan, an environmental scientist.He was in the team of Madhav Gadgil, who has prepared a report to save the fragile ecology of the Western Ghats in 2011 on the instruction of former Union environment minister Jairam Ramesh.“It seems the state has failed to learn a lesson from two consecutive floods (in 2018 and 2019) that claimed many lives...Votaries of the new dam should think about the future generation also,” Vijayan said.The previous no-objection certificate to the project was issued in 2016 by the state power ministry. It was set to expire in July. Tribal families living in the forests, too, are apprehensive. “They will have to kill us before building the dam. It is a ploy to plunder green cover and destroy the serene waterfall,” said Kadar tribe leader P Kaliappan.State power minister MM Mani clarified that renewing the non-objection certificate was a natural process and it didn’t mean the project will be commissioned immediately.“We are not in a tearing hurry. All stakeholders will be taken into confidence. Activism is okay, but it should not be at the cost of the state’s development,” Mani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-faces-criticism-for-nod-to-hydel-project/story-zBMH3Nf6tt3Nbw9KBwWkNM.html

10-06-2020||India||ED registers money laundering case against Medanta hospital||New Delhi: The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has filed a money-laundering case against Medanta Hospital, its chairman Dr Naresh Trehan and unknown Haryana government officers for alleged irregularities in the allotment of land to the hospital in 2004, people familiar with the development said on Wednesday.The ED’s PMLA (prevention of money laundering act) case is based on a Gurugram police FIR filed on June 6 naming Trehan’s company Global Health Pvt Ltd, which runs Medicity at Sector 38, Gurugram, among others.The ED has named all the 16 accused mentioned in the Gurugram police FIR, an official said. This includes two officers of the Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) An RTI (right to information) activist Raman Sharma filed a public interest litigation (PIL) in the matter in the court of additional district and sessions judge Ashwani Kumar, citing irregularities and use of several companies for laundering money.The Medanta hospital has denied the allegations as “false, baseless and motivated”.In a statement on Wednesday, Trehan said, “The allegations in his complaint pertain to the 16-year-old land allotment on which the hospital is built. Everything about this land allotment, which was done through a public auction, is absolutely legal. The allegations in the complaint are nothing short of absurd. We have built one of the finest hospitals in this part of the world, and we are proud of the work we do.”“This complaint is nothing but harassment by Raman Sharma, who has chosen to file this complaint while we are in the midst of a global pandemic. Despite being over 70 years of age I continue to tend to my patients, even in the face of this pandemic, and at risk to myself. It is of grave concern that doctors and hospitals are having to bear the brunt of harassment, by people of dubious antecedents,” Trehan said.The case pertains to the allotment of land to the hospital in 2004. The Haryana government, through HSVP, allotted 53 acres of land in Sector 38 along the Delhi-Jaipur road (NH-48), for the development of Medicity.An official statement on Tuesday by Medanta Hospital on the Gurugram police FIR said: “This complaint has been filed by a person who claims to be an RTI activist. However, it has been reported in the press that he has had an FIR for extortion registered against him. All the allegations in this complaint are completely false, baseless and motivated.”Sharma had alleged that Medanta, in connivance with government officials, obtained pecuniary advantage as “land meant for institutional purposes was used for pure commercial, speculative and self servient purposes” and several acres of land were allotted at undervalued rates. Sharma also alleged that the accused obtained occupational certificates based on misrepresentation, as there was no area on the premises that was allocated for medical and paramedical education, as advertised.In his complaint, which is now part of the FIR, Sharma has alleged that the Haryana government in 2004 evicted locals from their ancestral land in the area, now known as Sector 38, Gurugram, for public purpose under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1984. Thereafter, the state government, through the HUDA (Haryana urban development authority), released an advertisement for the ‘Medicity Project’, which was envisaged to have super-speciality hospitals of international standards, academic medical institutions and other institutions related to medical care and research to provide state-of-the-art facilities at one place along with ancillary and subservient services in the form of a shopping mall and a yatri niwas (guest lodge).Sharma has further alleged that factors of eligibility, and terms and conditions were nullified at various stages by accused government officials causing pecuniary advantage to Trehan, Sachdeva, Punj and Jain, and causing immense loss to the state. “Accused 5 (government officials) abused position by criminal misconduct and influence, caused pecuniary advantage to accused 1, 2, 3 and 4 (Trehan, Sachdeva, Punj and Jain),” the complaint stated.The government officials allotted the entire site of Medicity to Trehan without any consideration of his financial capability, he added.In its Tuesday statement, the hospital said that Sharma, the complainant in the case on whose allegations the FIR was registered, had previously filed two cases, one in a Patiala House court and another in the Delhi high court, identical to this one, and both were dismissed.“Extortionists have found a fertile breeding ground, while claiming to be RTI activists. The fact that the allegations in his complaint pertain to the 16-year-old land allotment on which the hospital is built demonstrates this,” the statement said.The FIR was registered on Saturday at Sadar police station after Sharma, a resident of Malibu Town condominium in the city, approached the district court. On June 5, the court directed the police to lodge an FIR within 24 hours of the receipt of the complaint. The court observed that without proper investigation, justice could not be ensured in the case and for that, lodging an FIR was a prerequisite.Sharma on Wednesday refuted the Tuesday statement released by the hospital. “I chose to contest the allegations of extortion against me and in that trial, neither the statement of the complainant nor other witnesses have been recorded. That matter is sub judice. In this case, I shall be submitting documents supporting the allegations in the court.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-registers-money-laundering-case-against-medanta-hospital/story-sPmhHLPCF211u9DHSdXwvL.html
10-06-2020||India||Assam gas well fire rages on, two firefighters killed||Guwahati: The fire that broke out on Tuesday at Oil India Limited’s (OIL) gas well in Assam’s Tinsukia district has claimed the lives of two firefighters including that of a former 30-year-old national-level footballer, officials said on Wednesday and added the inferno is unlikely to be controlled anytime sooner.National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) personnel recovered bodies of assistant fire operators Durlov Gogoi, a former goalkeeper who represented Assam, and Tikheswar Gohain, 56 from a water body close to the well. The two, who went missing on Tuesday, were working to control the blowout, or leakage of gas and condensate, from the well when it caught fire. The blowout began on May 27.“It was a difficult operation to retrieve the bodies as the water was warm and fire at the well was blowing very high. The two bodies were found close to each other,” said NDRF inspector Saurabh Singh.In a statement, OIL said immediate compensation has been disbursed to the families of the two. Five other people, who were working at the well when it caught fire, have received minor injuries.Nearly 2,000 families, which were evacuated because of the blowout beyond a radius of 1.5 km from the well, have now been shifted even further and housed in 12 relief camps.Residents of the area on Tuesday staged a protest near the site and blamed OIL for failing to control the blowout for two weeks.The well is located near the Dibru Saikhowa National Park and the eco-sensitive Maguri Mottapung wetland, which are home to endangered hoolock gibbons and Gangetic dolphins.The statement said a team of experts from Alert Disaster Control, Singapore, visited the well site on Wednesday to assess the situation and to prepare for the next course of action.Assam chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal’s office said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has assured the state of all help to tackle the situation.OIL said the foreign experts have expressed confidence about controlling the fire and capping the well safely, but the operation requires a large amount of water, installation of high discharge pumps, and removal of debris. All these could take nearly four weeks, it added.A similar fire at an abandoned oil well in Dibrugarh was controlled after over a month with the help of foreign experts in 2005.Experts have warned the fire and the blowout could have a damaging impact on the flora and fauna of the national park and the wetland a few hundred metres away.“Release of particulate matter and the fire will affect Dibru Saikhowa National Park. But the damage to Maguri Mottapung wetland will be immense. If this continues for another four weeks, humans will also not remain unaffected by the pollution,” said environmentalist Rituraj Phukan, who is also a member of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.Two days after the blowout, a carcass of a Gangetic dolphin with its skin peeled was found at the wetland. There is no confirmation yet on whether it died due to the release of gas and condensate from the well.“There are few methods to control a blowout. First, the area near the affected well is cleared of all debris. One of the oldest techniques is to carry out a blast at the well so that there is lack of oxygen and gas [or oil] in the area and the fire gets doused,” said an oil drilling expert, who refused to be named.“Another method is to drill another well or wells near the site and connect them to the blow out well allowing the gas or oil to get diverted. Another option is to put a new Blow out Preventer (BoP), which are large valves used to cap the well on the surface.”During the process, a large amount of water has to be continuously sprayed to control the fire and to lower the temperature so that the new BoP does not heat up too much. The entire process needs a lot of planning and coordination and can easily take weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-gas-well-fire-rages-on-two-firefighterskilled/story-DN2RMQlrWwI8irE1rKJk3O.html

10-06-2020||India||Pedestrianisation project on the cards||New Delhi: Public places will need to become more suited for pedestrians and walking and cycling networks will need to be expanded in a post-Covid world, the Union housing and urban affairs ministry said in an advisory to states, asking them to redesign some market places as part of a pedestrianisation experiment. The initiative comes at a time when experts fear increased infection risk in mass transit, which in India is usually crowded at rush hours. Experts and officials handling policy in these areas believe those that can will switch to personal transport, which could have implications for pollution as well as congestion. “COVID-19 has brought cities around the world to a halt. Public transport is either shut or very limited in many cities. Movement of private motor vehicles is controlled. However, cities have benefitted from cleaner air. As cities look to ease the lockdown, the need of the hour is to provide safe, affordable and equitable modes of transport and also ensure physical distancing,” the advisory said. The ministry has asked states to select at least three market places in cities with million-plus population for the ‘pedestrianisation’ plan. For cities with fewer than a million people, at least one market area has to be redesigned and the selections need to be done by the end of this month, the ministry said in the advisory, seen by HT. “This will require proper survey of space used in the present scenario by various stakeholders. A movement/direction plan has to be prepared to see that there are designated walking paths where visitors are able to follow social distancing,” it said.Once the plan is made and firmed up, cities may start implementing it in two phases: measures that can be done in the short-term and those that will need more time. “Short-term recommendations include interventions that are quick, temporary, east to install, and ensure safety to commuters after the lockdown. The market spaces could be rearranged with quick and temporary measures such as barricades, road closure for vehicles, etc…On-street parking space or even carriageway lanes can be re-purposed for more walking and waiting space…Cyclists may be allowed with dedicated/ear-marked pathways,” it said. Access ways motor vehicles for area residents should be clearly delineated and municipal bodies may increase the width of foot paths of the streets leading to the market, it added, while also recommending provisions for high frequency public transit.According to the ministry, redesigning vending spaces provides a good opportunity for innovations and long-term local authorities can begin working on long-term permanent structures to increase pedestrianisation once short-term steps prove effective. The planning, which the government described as needing to be holistic, can be done over the next three months till September 30 but a survey of vendors and others users of a market should be done by July 31. “By the end of September 2020, a plan may be formalised to start implementation. Short term measures such as temporary barricading, closure of roads for traffic, earmarking spaces, etc. to assess the plan on the field may be started in the first week of October 2020. The assessment of the implemented plan through short term measures may be done by November 2020 and amendments as required ma be completed by November 2020,” it added. Experts welcomed the initiative. “This is a very important step and we should move quickly on it. If you look at cities around the world—London, New York etc, they are all moving shorter trips to cycling and walking which are contact-free and make mobility safer. They also reduce pressure on already stressed public transport systems that will have to operate under social distancing norms. In urban India about nearly 48% of daily trip are below a distance of 5 KM and this is a big opportunity for India to move these short trips towards cycling and to promote it as an independent mode of travel. With the advisory we will have a clear map into transitioning towards pedestrianisation,” said Anumita Roy Chowdhury, executive director (research and advocacy), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pedestrianisation-project-on-the-cards/story-XTETBUbvNvXkTwRQWBt70L.html
10-06-2020||India||Raj starts regulating interstate commutes||The Rajasthan government regulated interstate movement on Wednesday with a steady rise in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. According to directions by the state home department to district collectors and the police, travelling outside Rajasthan will be banned without a special pass.A district collector, police commissioner, deputy commissioner of police, superintendent of police, deputy superintendent of police, sub-divisional magistrate, and the local police station can issue these passes.“For those travelling outside the state by road (other than by scheduled buses), screening of persons and verification of pass/IDs shall be ensured at the check posts to be set up at the border,” said an order signed by Rajeeva Swarup, additional chief secretary of home department.The order said counters will be set up at airports, railway stations and bus stands for issuing on-spot passes after verification of valid identity cards.People travelling outside the state by air, train or bus having reservation till June 10, and those travelling in case of an emergency are exempt.“It has come to notice of the state government that certain persons from hotspots and other areas, under the prevailing system of free movement, travelled outside the state after Covid testing and before their report was received, which turned out positive subsequently, posing threat to wherever they go,” Swarup said in the order.“Keeping in view the efforts made by the state government till date for preventing the spread of Covid-19, and in the interest of public safety, it has become necessary to regulate the interstate movement of persons. Accordingly, the directions have been issued, which will remain effective till further orders and till such time that the present situation is reviewed,” he said.Rajasthan is the fifth worst-affected state in the country. It ended Wednesday with a total of 11,600 cases and 259 fatalities.In a related development, the Rajasthan medical and health department announced that it will test people coming from abroad on special flights being organised by the Indian government after they complete seven days of mandatory institutional quarantine.According to an order by Rohit Kumar Singh, additional chief secretary of the health department, it has been observed that many of such people tested positive after they reached their home districts for seven days of home quarantine following their institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raj-starts-regulating-interstate-commutes/story-01zFgcK1niO0wdr7z74gVO.html
10-06-2020||India||Row over Goa govt’s decision to go ahead with Parrikar memorial despite fund crunch||The Goa government’s decision to go ahead with the work on the samadhi for former chief minister Manohar Parrikar, despite the state facing a severe fund crunch and needs money for tackling the Covid19 pandemic. At the forefront of the campaign is the local unit of the Aam Aadmi Party, which has questioned the government’s decision and approached the Goa governor demanding that the project be postponed. AAP spokesperson Valmiki Naik questioned the government’s claim that there is no money to offer monetary relief to sections of society affected by the lockdown but continues spending on the large projects. “Work appears to be going on in full swing on this memorial in Miramar. The amount of money you are blowing on this project can buy 50,000 more Covid-19 tests. What is more important for us Goans today?”“Because of the state’s empty coffers, you have refused to give any financial help to suffering Goans. You are continuing to borrow money in our names for even the most basic expenses, and you haven’t prepared adequately to fight the Covid crisis, but you have crores to waste on such non-critical projects?” Naik asked. The foundation stone for a ‘samadhi’ of former chief minister and defence minister Manohar Parrikar, who passed away in March 2019, was laid in December last year. Being built at an estimated cost of Rs 10 crore, the project has been criticized for its cost, necessity and on account of environmental damage to the ecosystem at the Miramar beach in Panaji. Naik also petitioned the governor against the proposal. “It is very likely that there are many such projects which could be postponed or even scrapped, thereby saving the government hundreds of crores of rupees which it doesn’t even have the luxury of spending at the moment,” he said in his letter to the Governor. A case filed against the construction of the samadhi is pending before the Bombay High Court at Goa. The state cabinet in a decision taken on Wednesday has decided not to sanction any new projects involving capital expenditure until December 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/row-over-goa-govt-s-decision-to-go-ahead-with-parrikar-memorial-despite-fund-crunch/story-bpgeCAzT2AD41xusV5R4YI.html

There are a lot of difficulties and crises. Our villages, poor, labourers, farmers and industries are facing a crisis. The crisis faced by the government of India has also grown. Some of our state governments don’t have money to pay salaries next month,” Gadkari said.Gadkari said the estimated loss in revenue was worrying for the economy.“We have a GDP of Rs 200 lakh crore 10% of which i.e. 20 lakh crore has been given as a package for all sections of the society. A revenue drop of Rs 10 lakh crore is expected. We can understand that if Rs 30 lakh crore is reduced from Rs 200 lakh crore what would be the situation ahead. But Atal ji’s verses give us a lot of strength that ‘kadam se kadam milakhar chalna hoga’, ‘Koshish karne waalon ki kabhi haar nahi hoti’,” the road and transport minister said.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesHe, however, underlined that the country will recover from any adverse circumstances under the able leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi and will win the twin battles.“We will make an Atmnirbhar Bharat. We will reduce import and increase export. We will strengthen village industry, rural industry, handloom and handicraft. People won’t need to migrate from rural to urban areas for jobs. Employment will be available in villages. This year we have faced a crisis due to Corona. We are fighting the economic battle seriously. This is also a serious crisis. But we will win both the battles.”The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Gadkari added that people needed to learn to live with the coronavirus in their midst. “For instance, we are holding a rally through an electronic medium today,” he said.Underlining the achievements of the Narendra Modi government, Gadkari said what Modi government achieved in five years, Congress couldn’t achieve in the 55 to 60 years of its rule.He said it was Modi government that worked with courage and commitment to eradicate Maoism and terrorism from the country.“Earlier, there used to be appeasement. The situation was such that Congress leaders went to the house of terrorists killed in Batla House shootout incident but didn’t visit the house of the police officer who was killed fighting them.State Congress spokesperson Abhay Dubey said the government should explain the reasons for massive unemployment in the country along with other crises.“This is obvious that the central ministers of the Narendra Modi government will cite Corona for every problem faced by the country. The Prime Minister must tell people what he did in the past six years when there was no corona. Why was the country facing a massive unemployment and along with other crises faced by every section of the society.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gadkari-recalls-vajpayee-s-words-while-assessing-economic-cost-of-coronavirus/story-oqxBcM85W8HkOr9mbIZ9uL.html
10-06-2020||India||Russia shouldn’t interfere in disputes between India and China, says top Russian lawmaker||Russia shouldn’t interfere in disputes between India and China and instead act as an “honest broker” to contribute to solutions that don’t involve the use of military force, the chairman of the Russian upper house committee on foreign affairs said on Wednesday. Konstantin Kosachev, the head of the Federation Council’s committee on foreign affairs, also said the Taliban are “a very influential and important” part of the peace process in Afghanistan even though Russia continues to see the group as an extremist movement. India, as a neighbour of Afghanistan, also has a key role in the process to find a solution in the war-torn country, he added.Interacting with a small group of journalists in New Delhi via video conference from Moscow, Kosachev was sceptical of US President Donald Trump’s move to invite India, Russia, Australia and South Korea to an expanded G7 Summit later this year, saying the move appeared to be aimed against China.Asked whether Russia could play any role in the stand-off between Indian and Chinese troops along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), he replied Moscow’s log-standing position is that such bilateral disputes should be handled by the countries involved.“Russia should not interfere in these kinds of disputes, but our role…is to be an honest broker to contribute to a dialogue and to do the utmost in order to prevent and avoid any solutions connected with the use of military force,” said Kosachev, who plays an influential role in Russia’s foreign policy set-up.This is the political message Russia keeps sending to “Chinese and Indian friends” as it respects the sovereignty of both countries, he said. Russia-China ties, which are “in the best shape ever” in decades, aren’t aimed against any other country, he added.Russia’s good relations with both China and India are “factors that mutually strengthen each other and provide good opportunities for the solution of problems that still exist between India and China”, Kosachev said.Responding to a question on the Taliban’s role in the Afghan peace process and India being kept out of most discussions on the future of Afghanistan, he said Russia perceives the Taliban as a “very difficult partner”.The Taliban is classified in Russia as an “extremist movement” though it isn’t prohibited. “At the same time, we are realists and we understand that the Taliban is a very influential and very important part of the ongoing processes in Afghanistan,” he said.“If you just try to exclude the Taliban from any type of political dialogue, you will not reach anywhere. So whether you like the Taliban [or not], you have to recognise the existence of the Taliban and the potential of the Taliban as a part of the ongoing processes,” Kosachev said.Other countries, including Russia and India, should contribute to the fragile political dialogue between the authorities in Kabul and the Taliban, he said. “India is a neighbour of Afghanistan…So I’m absolutely in favour of having India as an equal and very important participant in the ongoing discussions,” he added.Referring to US President Trump’s recent move to invite Russia and India to the G7 Summit in September, Kosachev said the American leaders doesn’t have the right to expand the grouping. Trump is free to invite additional participants to the summit but they won’t be able to join the preparations or to influence the outcomes and decisions, he said.There was also no unity among the other members of the G7, such as the UK and Canada, which have opposed the invitation to Russia, he said. Besides, Trump appears to be interested in bringing together other countries to create a joint opposition to China, and Russia is opposed to blocs that are arrayed against a third country, Kosachev said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-shouldn-t-interfere-in-disputes-between-india-and-china-says-top-russian-lawmaker/story-27eVcC2dMbTsp0okpNUzKM.html

Three senior residents of AIIMS were home quarantined in their apartments for the last week after the area was declared a containment zone by the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation.“I am distressed to note that over the past few weeks there have been instances of health workers getting infected with Covid-19. This points to a probable breach in maintaining infection control practices. I would like to emphasize again that you are the strength of the people in this long war. Please first ensure your safety and the safety of your team,” said Patnaik, while attending a technical workshop for health personnel.Two days ago, four anesthesiologists in MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur town had tested positive for Covid-19 while two doctors at Rourkela General Hospital too contacted the virus. One each in Cuttack, Nayagarh and Angul district too have tested positive in the last fortnight. Apart from them, 13 nurses including 8 in MKCG Medical College and Hospital in Berhampur town have tested Covid-19 positive so far. Apart from them, other frontline health workers, such as ASHA workers, Anganwadi workers, sanitary staff, teachers engaged in quarantine centres as well as sarpanch in-charge of these centres are increasingly testing positive.Officials said 58 health professionals, including doctors and 48 non-health workers including a sarpanch and teachers working at quarantine centres have been infected. The Odisha Medical Services Association, a body of serving doctors in government hospitals of the state, alleged that doctors and nurses deployed at non-Covid-19 hospitals are working in risky conditions without personal protective equipment. OMSA president Dr Narayan Rout demanded that all medical staff should be provided at least five N95 masks per week apart from adequate PPE.“It is now essential that these protocols continue to be meticulously followed by you, to prevent infection amongst our valuable frontline workers and to maintain the faith of the people in our health institutions,” said Patnaik in his appeal to frontline workers.The CM’s warning came on a day when the state reported 110 new cases, taking the total tally in the state to 3,250. Out of the 110 new cases, 97 were reported from quarantine centres while 13 are local contacts. The infected people include one staff from a private hospital in Bhubaneswar.The chief minister who over last week enforced weekend shutdown in 11 districts that are seeing rising Covid-19 cases, said his government has taken extensive measures for training of personnel and purchase of required consumables, for personal protection of healthcare workers.“It is our collective responsibility to ensure that infection control measures and personal protection protocols are scrupulously followed in health facilities and by healthcare workers in the field,” he said.The CM also directed the health department to begin door-to-door integrated health surveillance for Covid-19, co-morbid conditions, TB, malaria and diarrhoea in view of the ensuing rainy season.The state government, meanwhile, approved payment of incentive to the contractual, out-sourced and volunteer health care people working to contain Covid-19. The incentive would be equivalent to the consolidated basic remuneration of a month excluding allowances or perks or taxes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-58-health-workers-testing-covid-19-positive-naveen-patnaik-warns-about-infection-control/story-Tx0Tz3qSy22nc5ypIeecXN.html

The pandemic has caused indescribable distress to countless daily wagers and casual workers across India who have lost their livelihood. A group of about fifty families comprising manual scavengers and migrant daily wage labourers was living in horrifying conditions in hutments perched near Shivar Garden, Thane, Maharashtra.When Mumbai-based actor Parvin Dabas saw a picture of a four-year-old child from the locality on WhatsApp, he could not hold back his tears. The little boy was hunting for food in a garbage dump. Dabas at once decided to help the child’s family that had got no ration for many weeks.Dabas traced the boy’s families with the help of Rupa Bhaskaran, a volunteer with Aastha Parivaar NGO that has been distributing emergency ration kits among the needy across Mumbai. The actor immediately arranged for ration kits for the family and fifty other families living in the same area. “Shivar Garden is one of the worst affected areas. There are manual scavengers, daily wage labourers and balloon sellers living here. Earlier, they lived on the footpath but the police removed them during the pandemic. They have perched tents around Shivar Garden. These people are in a terrible state. I am grateful to Parvin Dabas who come forward to help them. One man, Sahil Kumar, broke down when I gave him the kit…he hadn’t eaten for many days,” says Bhaskaran. Dabas contacted Suresh Gurjar, a local shopkeeper in Mira Road who has been preparing ration kits for distribution and placed a request. “I received a call from Parvin ji, pehle toh main pehchan nahi paya, unhone bataya ki woh ration kits banwana chahte hai. Unhone 50 pariwaron ke liye kits banwayi (I got a call from Parvin ji. Initially, I didn’t recognise him. He ordered ration kits for 50 families),” says Gurjar.  Later, Gurjar’s kids told him that he was a popular actor. Gurjar was moved by Dabas’ act of kindness. “May God bless him for his noble deed. My children are very inspired by him,” he says. Dabas says he just fulfilled his duty. “Being a father of two, it pains me deeply to see any child in distress. I don’t think I did anything great, I feel I just what I was supposed to do. I can’t say no to anyone who reaches out to me. I believe every child deserves the chance in life to be the best that he can be…the least each one of us can do is to provide every child at least the basic necessities of life in such trying times,” says Dabas.Such stories restore your faith in there’s some good in this world that is holding it together.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kindling-kindness-actor-parvin-dabas-became-a-messiah-for-these-families-in-distress/story-9qSx3ZyYCmVx8UgX96DpzL.html
10-06-2020||India||Telangana Bonalu festival cancelled due to rising Covid-19 cases in Hyderabad||The Telangana government has decided to cancel this year’s Bonalu festival, one of the biggest traditional folk festivals in the state, due to the persistent threat posed by the coronavirus pandemic. The decision was taken by the Telangana ministers from Hyderabad in consultation with various temple committees in the city that celebrate the festival in a big way every year. The Bonalu was declared a state festival by the Telangana government after the state’s formation in 2014.Speaking to reporters later, state minister for animal husbandry Talasani Srinivasa Yadav said the festival would be held by the priests of the temple in a simple manner this year without involving devotees. He appealed to the devotees to celebrate the festival in their houses and not to visit temples.“The traditional offering of ‘bonam’ (derived from Bhojanam, meaning meals) to the goddess Mahankali will be done by priests within the temple premises. Even the procession of “ghatam” (pot carrying bonam) will be restricted to the temple premises. The government would supply traditional silk clothes for the presiding deity in the temples a day before the festival,” he said.‘Bonalu’ is a traditional folk festival celebrated every year in the Telugu month of Ashadham (falling in June/July), in the twin cities of Hyderabad and Secunderabad, and some other parts of Telangana state. The devotees worship Goddess Mahankali (a form of Durga) seeking her divine blessings to overcome all obstacles and get cured of diseases.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesDevotees make ‘bonam’ (meal, comprising cooked rice, milk and jaggery) in new earthen pots (ghatams), which womenfolk carry on their heads to the temple and offer to the deity. The pots are adorned with neem leaves, turmeric and vermilion.The festivities begin on the first Friday of Ashadham month and continue till the end. The main festivities begin at Goddess Mahankali temple at Golconda fort in the first week, followed by Ujjaini Mahankali temple at Secunderabad, Akkanna Madanna temple at Shalibanda and ends at the Mahankali temple at Laldarwaza in old city of Hyderabad.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Sections of people had demanded that the Bonalu festival be allowed to continue normally this year owing to belief that Goddess Mahankali would help devotees to overcome Covid-19 pandemic.“In fact, the Bonalu festival started in Hyderabad in 18th century when plague had broken out in the city claiming thousands of lives. It was goddess Mahankali which saved the people from the epidemic those days. This year, too, we wanted to celebrate to overcome Corona pandemic. It is not correct on the part of the government to cancel the celebrations,” argued G Niranjan, patron of Akkanan Madanna temple committee.Health department authorities had told chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao on Tuesday that it was not advisable to hold Bonalu festival this year since lakhs of people congregate at every temple during the festival which would likely result in an explosion of Covid cases in Hyderabad, a city already witnessing a surge in positive cases and deaths due to the virus in the last three weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-bonalu-festival-cancelled-due-to-rising-covid-19-cases-in-hyderabad/story-SPlzcjptyK2q46JdiyXoTJ.html

We are going to start the distribution of housing site pattas to the homeless soon and it is going to be a historic decision which will be remembered forever,” Jagan said.He said in the last one year, the government had distributed Rs 42,465 crore to about 3.58 crore beneficiaries through various schemes, adding that such a huge amount was never transferred to the beneficiaries’ account in this state before.“The benefits are being given to these sections on saturation basis, without looking into caste, creed, political affiliation and can be availed to those who did not vote for our party in the previous election as our motto is that no eligible candidate should be left out,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/financial-support-to-barbers-tailors-in-jagan-reddy-s-new-welfare-scheme/story-wVy8yTT35pYz96XL1bqF7J.html

She alleged that the Opposition was quick to criticize government initiatives but did nothing when in power. Irani’s virtual rally was focused on the ‘achievements’ of Narendra Modi’s government in the first year of its second term. She addressed the party members from Delhi through online streaming with party state president Bansidhar Bhagat and Nainital-US Nagar MP Ajay Bhatt attending it from the party office in Haldwani town of Nainital.Attacking the Opposition, Irani said, “The Opposition criticises PM Modi’s government on various issues. But I want to ask them, what they did when they were in power all these years?”“Why didn’t the banking services, during the opposition rule, reach 34 crore people, who now have Jan Dhan accounts due to PM Modi’s efforts? Also, why didn’t they think of providing free gas connections to the poor women of the country during their government, when we have given it to 8 crore people? They only made tall promises but did nothing for the poor,” said Irani.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe Union minister also took an indirect dig at Rahul Gandhi during her address.“I won’t take the name of that Congress leader and former Amethi MP who had once publicly torn down a copy of order given by PM,” Irani said in what appeared to be a reference to Rahul Gandhi’s act of publicly tearing a copy of an ordinance brought by the UPA government under Manmohan Singh in the year 2013.Irani added that all 130 cr people of the country were standing with Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his handling of this ongoing pandemic.”She also attacked the Opposition on the issue of farmers.“When they were in government, they never thought of transferring money to farmers but made hollow promises for their welfare. They just wanted them (the farmers) to beg for their rights so that they can do politics on it. But our government through Kisan Samman Nidhi have transferred money directly to the bank accounts of farmers in the country even in this lockdown,” she said.Irani also spoke about the infrastructural development in Uttarakhand by the Modi government.“The highly ambitious Char Dham all weather road project worth Rs 12,000 crore is under development along with Rs 13,000 crore railway project. Our government under PM Modi is investing heavily to develop the infrastructure in Uttarakhand. PM Modi even discussed the all weather road project and Kedarnath Dham restoration project with chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat on Wednesday,” said Irani.She also mentioned abrogation of Article 370, law banning Triple Talaq and paving the way for construction of Ram Mandir at Ayodhya as other achievements of the Modi government.Party state president Bansidhar Bhagar, too, attacked the Congress for questioning the BJP led state government on the issue of Gairsain as the state’s summer capital.Bhagat said, “The Congress is questioning us on why Gairsain has been made the state’s summer capital and not a permanent one. I want to ask them, why didn’t they do anything when they were in power twice? They know that they have nothing relevant to say hence they are making baseless attacks.”Also Read: Two Covid-19 patients die in Uttarakhand in 24 hours; 23 fresh cases take tally to 1560The Congress meanwhile attacked the BJP for holding virtual rallies amid the coronavirus pandemic.Suryakant Dhasmana, party state vice-president said, “When we had questioned the government on its failure in handling the pandemic in Uttarakhand, BJP had accused us of doing politics. Now, they are holding these virtual rallies all across the country including our state. They should now answer who is doing politics?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jan-dhan-and-ujjwala-scheme-figure-in-smriti-irani-s-attack-on-congress-in-uttarakhand/story-IGX1SSd1IFkaCRYWjgDGrI.html

Discussed the situation on corona in Delhi in detail. He assured of all cooperation,” Kejriwal tweeted after the meeting.Earlier in the day, Kejriwal said Delhi Lt Governor Anil Baijal’s order not to reserve hospital exclusively for the capital’s residents will be followed in “letter and spirit”.The chief minister said it was not a time for disagreements.Given the scale of the pandemic, the Delhi government’s projection estimates 44,000 cases by June 15 and 5.5 lakh cases by July 31.On Wednesday, Baijal also ordered all major hospitals in the national capital to prominently display the availability of beds and room charges outside their establishments in large letters on the LED boards.The state health department has been asked to ensure that the data displayed on these boards is in sync with the data on the government portal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arvind-kejriwal-amit-shah-discuss-covid-19-as-delhi-records-1-501-cases/story-QRICjCcC1aiv1DbIz1zCJL.html

It is not incorrect to state that the number of Covid-19 patients, in the country is increasing day by day and the recovery rate is above 48% but it is also true that a large number of people have died and the national capital is one of the worst-affected cities so far,” NHRC said.Maken filed the complaint with NHRC on Tuesday alleging that suspected patients are running from one hospital to another for admission, but the hospitals are turning them away.“The chart provided (by Maken to NHRC) indicates that the NCT of Delhi has a robust hospital infrastructure of 57,194 beds. It has a significant presence of central government hospitals also but it is painful to see that only 12% of the Delhi government, 8% of the central government institutions and 7% of the private hospital beds are presently occupied and are being used to treat Covid-19 patients,” the NHRC said. NHRC further said that around 70% dedicated beds in Delhi are still lying vacant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nhrc-sends-notice-to-delhi-govt-centre-on-covid-19-situation-in-national-capital/story-vVHJiMzLyjryJ6Ut4vgJOL.html

On June 3, the city witnessed the highest single-day spike in coronavirus cases at 1,513.In another development, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) sent notices to the Delhi government, Centre on Covid-19 situation in the national capital.Acting on a complaint by former Delhi Congress president Ajay Maken, the Commission has referred to difficulties being faced by the people in Delhi, due to non-availability of beds in the hospitals for Covid-19 patients and inadequate number of tests leading to a grim state of affairs and mismanagement, resulting in death of a large number of people.The meeting with home minister comes in the backdrop of Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal, on Monday, overturning the state government’s decision to reserve hospitals, except those run by the centre, exclusively for residents of Delhi. The state government’s decision to test only those showing symptoms of Covid-19 was also overruled, allowing asymptomatic cases and high-risk contacts of a virus patient to be tested.This afternoon, CM Kejriwal, underscoring that it is not the time for disagreements, said Lt Guv Baijal’s decision will be followed in “letter and spirit”.The chief minister said in the next few days he will personally step out to supervise the preparations to convert hotels and banquet halls into healthcare facilities.“Delhi will need 1.5 lakh beds in healthcare facilities by July 31 once people start coming to the city for treatment from other states”, Kejriwal said in his first virtual briefing since Sunday. The chief minister said out of the 1.5 lakh beds, it is estimated that 80,000 will be required for Delhiites, adding that the calculation is based on numbers that showed 50 per cent of the beds in hospitals in the national capital were occupied by those from other states before the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-arvind-kejriwal-meets-amit-shah-over-coronavirus-situation-in-delhi-says-assured-all-support/story-3Pyv9s6GVIH9uLS4T7HWZK.html

The national rights body, therefore, has directed the central and the Delhi government officials to consult and file a comprehensive report within 10 days.An official press statement from NHRC cites the complaint filed by Maken on Tuesday to raise concern over reports of suspected coronavirus patients running from one hospital to another for admission without luck.“The chart provided by the complainant indicates that the NCT of Delhi has a robust hospital infrastructure of 57,194 beds. It has a significant presence of Central government Hospitals also but it is painful to see that only 12% of the Delhi Government, 8% of the Central Government institutions and 7% of the Private Hospital beds are presently occupied and are being used to treat Covid patients,” said the official statement from NHRC.It further highlights that the Congress leader has demanded for setting aside 70% of all hospital beds in Delhi for Covid patients.“It is further stated that in Delhi around 70% dedicated beds are still lying vacant. While the residents of Delhi are struggling hard to fetch a bed in times of Corona crises, the Delhi government, despite confirming availability of beds, is not providing the same to the patients who need them to save their lives,” the statement says.Maken’s complaint to the human rights body adds that 33 out of the 38 health institutions under the Delhi government are not accepting Covid patients as only 5 hospitals have been designated as Covid Hospitals making people run from pillar to post in search of treatment for Covid-19, says NHRC statement.Also Read: ‘Delhi L-G Baijal’s orders to be implemented’: CM Kejriwal on hospitals rowThe human rights body adds that Maken has also alleged that an adequate number of tests to identify coronavirus patients are not being done by the Delhi government. The complaint has also alleged that cremations of Coved-19 positive patients are being delayed leading to a crisis.“The Complainant has further stated that cremations are taking upto 5-6 days after death and relatives of the deceased have been found struggling to find slots,” the NHRC release saysFor Coronavirus Live UpdatesThe human rights body has also sought to know the government’s response to allegations that it has tweaked the definition of containment zones which is proving to be counter-productive to disease containment goals. “On 29th April, when there were just 3439 COVID positive patients, Delhi had 102 containment zones. At a time when Delhi has around 30,000 positive cases, the containment zones are merely 183,” NHRC says quoting Maken’s complaint.It adds that according to the complainant, opening up areas affected with the virus, is a dangerous practice which will increase the outspread of the coronavirus endangering human lives across the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/70-hospital-beds-vacant-nhrc-cites-plea-asks-delhi-centre-to-reply/story-WbqBNoHan7A8RToYQGEdmL.html
10-06-2020||India||In post Covid-19 world, cities to have pedestrian-friendly markets, more cyclists: Centre||Post-Covid 19 market spaces will need to be more pedestrian friendly, cycling and walking network will need to be expanded, the Centre has told states in an advisory issued by the ministry of housing and urban affairs.The ministry has recommended holistic planning for pedestrian friendly market spaces in various cities and municipal areas in the country in consultation with stake holders. The ministry has asked states to select at least three market places in million-plus cities for the ‘pedestrianisation plan’ and non-million plus cities to select at least one market area.The selection of city market spaces for the plan has to be completed by June 30, 2020 according to the advisory reviewed by Hindustan Times.“Covid-19 has brought cities around the world to a halt. Public transport is either shut or very limited in many cities. Movement of private motor vehicles is controlled. However, cities have benefitted from cleaner air. As cities look to ease the lockdown, the need of the hour is to provide safe, affordable and equitable modes of transport and also ensure physical distancing,” the advisory said. “While the lockdown is being gradually relaxed, the need for social distancing, especially in market areas, will remain. The pandemic presents us with an opportunity to re-imagine streets for people. To make market areas Covid-19 safe and people friendly, Indian cities should consider pedestrianizing them. The need for personalized forms of transport is also expected to increase as a response to Covid-19. Cities around the world are leveraging the opportunity to expand their cycling network substantially,” it added.The holistic planning for pedestrian-friendly market space may be done in consultation with the stake holders. “This will require proper survey of space used in the present scenario by various stakeholders. A movement/direction plan has to be prepared to see that there are designated walking paths where visitors are able to follow social distancing,” it said.Once the plan is made and firmed up, cities may start implementation in two phases – short term and long term, the advisory states. “Short-term recommendations include interventions that are quick, temporary, easy to install, and ensure safety to commuters after the lockdown. The market spaces could be rearranged with quick and temporary measures such as barricades, road closure for vehicles., etc…On-street parking space or even carriageway lanes can be repurposed to provide more walking and waiting space…Cyclists may be allowed with dedicated/ear-marked pathways,” it said. Provision of access to motor vehicles for residents of the area to commute should be clearly delineated. Municipal Bodies may increase the width of foot paths of the streets leading to the market, it added.Adequate provision of high frequency public transit may be ensured for citizens to access the market area in a comfortable manner. The design of the vending spaces provides a good opportunity for innovations, the advisory said.“Long term permanent structures for promoting pedestrianisation can be developed after temporary short-term measures are found working,” it added.The holistic planning of the area through stakeholder consultation can be undertaken over the next three months, till September 30, the advisory noted, and the survey of the vendors and other users of the market space could be carried out and completed by July 31, 2020. “By the end of September 2020, a plan may be formalised to start implementation. Short term measures such a temporary barricading, closure of roads for traffic, earmarking spaces, etc. to assess the plan on the field may be started in the first week of October 2020. The assessment of the implemented plan through short term measures may be done by November 2020 and amendments as required may be completed by November 2020,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-post-covid-19-world-cities-to-have-pedestrian-friendly-markets-more-cyclists-centre/story-PXmq9CimNTtzTMApe7w38O.html

As of now we will go ahead with our plan to open it. I haven’t got any communication from the tantri in this regard. We have already started registration for the virtual queue,” said TDB president N Vasu. The TDB runs Sabarimala and other major temples in south and central Kerala. Kandararu Mohanararu, the Sabarimala tantri (supreme priest), said he has sent a letter to the TDB commissioner and spoke to TDB chairman N Vasu regarding the opening of the hill shrine.The TDB, however, claims that it has received no communication in this matter. The tantri is usually considered the final word on all ritualistic matters.During the 2018 violence over the entry of women in the temple following the Supreme Court verdict, both the TDB and the tantri had locked horns with the latter threatening to close down the temple.Citing a sharp increase in caseload in the neighbouring states, the priest said it is better to postpone the opening of the temple.“Many pilgrims throng the temple from neighbouring states as well. It will be difficult to keep a tab on all devotees. So the festival and other functions can be postponed now,” he said, adding allowing devotees at this juncture will pose a serious threat.His demand came in the wake of many Hindu organisations questioning the government’s decision to open shrines in the state. Earlier, the government had decided to allow ‘darshan’ for devotees at Sabarimala after applying virtual queue, submitting a Covid-free certificate obtained from a lab or hospital approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research.Unveiling the graded exit plan under Unlock 1, the central government had allowed reopening of places of worship for devotees, malls and restaurants from June 8 across the country. They have been shut since March 25, when the lockdown was first imposed to stem the spread of the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sabarimala-priest-favours-delay-temple-body-says-will-open-on-june-14/story-Fs1hg4umhkbj4i4gq1NizI.html

It is assumed they ran to the water body to escape, but were drowned.“It was a difficult operation to retrieve the bodies as the water was warm and fire at the well was blowing very high. The two bodies were found close to each other. They were later handed over to the local police,” said Inspector Saurabh Singh of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).In a statement on Wednesday, OIL said immediate compensation has been disbursed to the families of the deceased. Four other persons, two from OIL, one from Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) and a contract worker, working at the well when it caught fire, sustained minor injuries.“The team of experts from Alert Disaster Control, Singapore, visited the well site on Wednesday morning along with OIL and ONGC teams to assess the current situation and is currently preparing a roadmap for the next course of action,” read the OIL statement.Assam Chief Minister Sarbananda Sonowal apprised Prime Minister Narendra Modi of the situation at Baghjan over the telephone. The CM’s office in a statement said that the PM has assured all help to tackle the situation.Fire will take weeks to douseAccording to OIL, while the foreign experts have expressed confidence about controlling the fire and capping the well safely, the operation requires large quantities of water, installation of high discharge pumps and removal of debris. All these could take nearly four weeks.“There are few methods to control a blow out. First the area near the well is cleared of all debris. One of the oldest techniques is to carry out a blast at the well so that there is lack of oxygen and gas (or oil) in the area and the fire gets doused,” said a retired oil drilling expert refusing to be named.“Another method is to drill another well or wells near the site and connect them to the blow out well allowing the gas or oil to get diverted. Another option is to put a new Blow out Preventer (BoP), which are large valves used to cap the well on the surface,” he added.The entire process needs a lot of planning and coordination and can easily take weeks, the expert said.Damage to environmentThe fire is expected to have a damaging impact on the flora and fauna of the Dibru Saikhowa National Park, located around 1 km away from the gas well and also the eco-sensitive Maguri Mottapung wetland barely a few hundred metres away.“Release of particulate matter and the fire will affect Dibru Saikhowa National Park. But the damage to Maguri Mottapung weltand will be immense. If this continues for another four weeks, humans will also not remain unaffected by the pollution,” said environmentalist Rituraj Phukan, who is also a member of IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature)“Despite a history of over 100 years of oil and gas exploration in the area, it is surprising we don’t have the experts and equipment to deal with such an emergency,” he added.Two days after the blowout happened, the carcass of a Gangetic dolphin with its skin peeled was found at the Maguri Mottapung wetland. There’s no confirmation yet on whether it died due to release of gas and condensate from the OIL well.Role of OIL employees and Gujarat firmThe incident has raised questions about the role of John Energy, a Gujarat-based company which was conducting the work over operations at the well under supervision of OIL when the blowout happened.Workover is an intervention in an existing oil or natural gas well that requires invasive techniques like wireline, coil tubing or snubbing.The Baghjan well was producing 1 lakh standard cubic metre per day (SCMD) of gas at a depth of 3,870 metres. The blowout happened when workover operation was underway to produce gas from new sand (oil and gas bearing reservoir) at a depth of 3,729 metres.In the present case, while the workover operation was underway the head of the well was being repaired. The BoP installed in the well was also removed when gas started leaking from the well and resulted in the blow out.“The company is carrying out an internal inquiry and two officials responsible for the well have been placed under suspension. The probe will reveal if they were responsible or not,” said OIL spokesperson Tridiv Hazarika.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-gas-well-blaze-claims-2-lives-experts-preparing-roadmap-to-cap-fire/story-IFY6qs54SoX5Vj7m2YdSYM.html
10-06-2020||India||Never coined Corona Express, people did: Mamata Banerjee on attack by Amit Shah||A day after Union home minister Amit Shah took a jibe at West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for dubbing Shramik Special trains as “Corona Express”, Banerjee on Wednesday issued a rejoinder saying that the term was not her coinage and she was merely voicing the people’s opinion.Banerjee also announced that the period of institutional quarantine for migrant workers returning from Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu was being reduced to one week from 14 days. They would be tested for Covid-19 within that period. “I never coined the term Corona Express. I said that the public was saying so,” Banerjee said while adding that had the BJP-led union government run the Shramik Special trains for a week before announcing the pan-India lockdown then labourers would not have suffered for three months.ALSO READ | Amit Shah targets Mamata Banerjee on CAA, Covid-19Shah, while addressing Tuesday’s virtual rally had said that the term “Corona Express”, which Banerjee had used to refer to trains ferrying migrant workers, will turn into an “exit express” for the Trinamool Congress in Bengal.In May, while pinning the blame of rising coronavirus cases in the state on the railways, Banerjee had accused the national carrier of running “Corona Express trains” and not Shramik Specials. The chief minister had accused the railways of packing in more than 2,000 migrants in one train against the capacity of 1,200, instead of increasing the frequency and number of trains to cater to the rush.Around 11 lakh people, including migrant labourers, have entered the state in trains and buses during the lockdown. Another 30,000 is expected to arrive in the next three days in 22 trains, taking the total number of trains to Bengal to 255. Banerjee also said that state government offices will now operate in two shifts to bring down the rush during office hours, which is frequently leading to overcrowding in buses. Kolkata, with 3,018 cases out of the 8,985 cases in Bengal till June 9, has been registering the highest spike in Covid-19 cases every day.ALSO READ | ‘West Bengal remains the only state where political violence is propagated’: Amit ShahWhile the first shift would operate from 9:30 am to 2:30 pm, the second shift would operate from 12:30 pm to 5:30 pm. Previously, government offices used to run from 10:30 am to 5:30 pm. “I would also urge the private sector to allow their employees to work from home to reduce the rush on the roads and public conveyance. Only those employees must be allowed for whom it is absolutely necessary to come to office. The rest 50% to 70% of the work force can work from home. This is my appeal,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/never-coined-corona-express-people-did-mamata-banerjee-on-attack-by-amit-shah/story-ha1PlFkPlFCzUzcO3sUTvO.html

Later, the NM Joshi Marg personnel may also quiz him related to another case registered against him, where he had made a derogatory statement about Congress chief Sonia Gandhi in connection with the lynching of two Hindu seers in Palghar on April 16,” said a senior Indian Police Service (IPS) official, requesting anonymity.Goswami was summoned to Pydhonie police station on the basis of a complaint by Irfan Abubakar Shaikh, secretary, Raza Education Welfare Society.Sheikh had alleged in his FIR that Goswami tried to create hatred against the Muslim community and targeted a Bandra-based mosque that had no links to a protest by stranded migrant workers, who wanted to go back to their native places on April 14, when lockdown 1.0, which was imposed to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak, restrictions were slated to be lifted.Shaikh had alleged that Goswami on his April 29 show tried to spread hatred against Muslims.“The mosque near the Bandra railway station is not linked to the stranded migrant workers’ protest. The workers had only gathered in an open space near the mosque. But Goswami deliberately highlighted the mosque on his show on April 29 to create communal disturbances in Mumbai,” Shaikh alleged.“The raging debate on the Republic TV was aimed at blaming the Muslim community for spreading Covid-19 in Mumbai. Earlier, too, he made hate-filled comments, targeting the community,” he further alleged.The FIR was registered under Sections 153A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, and language), 295A (deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings of any citizen) 500 (defamation), 505 (2) (spreading rumour or alarming news with intent to create or promote feelings of enmity, hatred or ill-will between different religious, racial, language or regional groups or castes or communities), and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).Lawyers from Phoenix Legal, who are representing Goswami in the cases, couldn’t be contacted, despite HT’s attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/following-hc-order-arnab-goswami-reaches-nm-joshi-marg-police-station-for-interrogation/story-s2e35eiXklqNX6Md13W0mN.html
10-06-2020||India||In Nepal’s map tactics, a reflection of China’s growing footprint in Kathmandu||As Nepal’s parliament took the first step on Tuesday to formalise the country’s new political map that has set up a row with India, foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali made another request to New Delhi for dialogue.Gyawali told news agency AP that Kathmandu wanted to sit across the table with India for formal negotiations so that the two countries “with a very unique type of partnership” could develop a more inspiring relationship.New Delhi hasn’t responded to requests for foreign secretary-level talks made after Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli cabinet hurriedly passed a new political map that counts Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as its own.Senior government officials told Hindustan Times that Kathmandu shouldn’t expect any dialogue on the three Indian territories either.“Once Nepal drew the red lines on the map to serve its domestic and foreign interests, there was nothing to talk about,” he said.In Kathmandu and New Delhi, PM Oli - who came to power on the nationalistic agenda - has been widely perceived to have rushed through the new political map to whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments to consolidate support within the ruling Communist Party of Nepal. That sentiment, quite similar to his election rhetoric, targets New Delhi.Also Read: The costs of anti-Indian nationalism in Nepal | HT EditorialDomestic politics apart, the map also helps KP Oli score points with Beijing, Nepal’s other giant neighbour.It hasn’t gone unnoticed in New Delhi that KP Oli had timed the new political map around the same time India and China were engaged in a standoff in the Ladakh sector.Nepal, and PM Oli have a track record of trying to steer the India-China rivalry to his advantage. But increasingly, analysts in Kathmandu concede that China’s influence over Kathmandu was rising rapidly.In some ways, one analyst in Kathmandu said, China, which poured millions of dollars in Nepal, has gradually encircled the himalayan nation.Chinese investments in Nepal started to surge from 2008 when Kathmandu switched from a monarchy to a republic in 2008.By 2014, China outranked India in terms of total investment. In 2015-16, China contributed 42 per cent of the total FDI to Nepal.According to the latest available data, China has again surpassed India as top investor in Nepal in the first quarter of 2019-20 with a total pledge of $ 88 million FDI representing 93 per cent of total committed FDI of $95 million. Britain came next with $ 1.85 million followed by India’s $ 1.76 million.Nepal is also getting a second Chinese cement plant being set up with $ 140 million investment; the first was Hongshi Cement.This increase is also seen in Chinese overseas development assistance where China overtook Indian aid in 2015, growing steadily from $ 19 million in 2010-11 to $ 38 million in 2014-15 as compared to India’s $22 million.Nepal has also been nudging Beijing to build projects worth an estimated $ 3 billion via a grant, not the soft loan that China has agreed to. If Nepal does eventually sign off on the soft loan, it would dwarf other Chinese loans including the ones extended to build Pokhara international airport and the Trishuli 3A hydropower project.The Chinese influence was on display earlier this year also when its mission in Kathmandu rebuked the Nepal media on February 19, and accused The Kathmandu Post editor of “ulterior motives” because the newspaper had published an article critical of China’s handling of the coronavirus virus. The public reprimand, ironically, coincided with Democracy Day of Nepal. But there were no protests from the Oli government who is seen to pursue a “nationalist” agenda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-nepal-s-map-tactics-a-reflection-of-china-s-growing-footprint-in-kathmandu/story-ydQNYa8nEd8wL5vDQg0dBJ.html

He also warned that lockdown could be clamped again in the state if the residents failed to honour the current level of restrictions.“We have been demanding for the resumption of the local rail services from the Centre. The hospital staff and other workforce engaged in essential and emergency services are finding it difficult to commute from far off areas to Mumbai. Some of them are not even able to report to the duty. The resumption of the locals is very important for the ease of this workforce,” Thackeray said.CM said he had first raised the issue of the resumption of suburban rail services with Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a video conference about a month ago.Thackeray also served a warning to people in the state to follow the restrictions put in place to check the rise of coronavirus disease failing which the state may be forced to clamp a hard lockdown to contain the virus which has already infected 90,787 people in the state, which is the highest among all Indian states.For Coronavirus Live UpdatesEarlier according to data released by Maharashtra Police, a total of 124,369 cases have been registered in the state under Section 188 of Indian Penal Code since March 22 for violation of coronavirus lockdown norms. Of these, about 846 accused were arrested in cases of assault on policemen, according to news agency ANI.Thackeray said that though relaxations were important for the revival of the economy, the government may be compelled to withdraw them if the norms are not followed.Also Read: ‘Over one lakh booked for violating Covid-19 lockdown norms in Maharashtra“The lockdown has been extended till June 30 with the relaxations rolled out recently.

Temperatures had soared to over 40 degrees Celsius in the past two days in Delhi, when the wind direction was north-westerly. Now, the wind direction is easterly and there is a lot of moisture incursion,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre.Monsoon has advanced into parts of Tamil Nadu, some more parts of west-central and northern Bay of Bengal; most parts of Mizoram, Manipur, and Tripura and some parts of Assam and Nagaland.The conditions are becoming favourable for advancement of monsoon into some more parts of central Arabian Sea; Goa; some parts of Maharashtra; some more parts of Karnataka and Rayalaseema; some parts of Telangana and coastal Andhra Pradesh; more parts of central and northern Bay of Bengal and more parts of north-eastern states during the next 48 hours.“The conditions are likely to become favorable subsequently for further advancement of monsoon into Maharashtra; remaining parts of Karnataka, Telangana, Rayalaseema, coastal Andhra Pradesh, entire Sikkim and some parts of Odisha and West Bengal during the next 24 hours,” IMD said in its Wednesday’s bulletin.The low-pressure area over east-central and adjoining the west-central Bay of Bengal persists with the associated cyclonic circulation extending up to mid-tropospheric levels tilting south-westwards.“It’s likely to move west-northwestwards and become well marked during the next 48 hours. Under the influence of this low-pressure area, heavy to very heavy rainfall is likely to occur over Odisha, north coastal Andhra Pradesh and Telangana on June 10 and 11 and over central India from June 11 to 13,” the bulletin added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-ncr-to-get-rain-thundershowers-for-5-6-days-imd/story-KDLWx4eYdFO3Hall8oKrlO.html
10-06-2020||India||Kerala’s no-objection certificate to hydel project leads to outrage among green activists||The Kerala government’s decision to renew a no-objection certificate to the Athirapally hydro-electric project in Thrissur district has kicked off a fresh debate on the project with the state government and green activists at loggerheads. With the government saying it will not succumb to green activism, environmentalists have retorted that the state government is yet to learn a lesson from the last two floods.The proposed project across Chalakudy River has triggered fresh protests with even the junior partner in the ruling Left Democratic Front, the CPI, saying it will not allow the power project to be implemented. However, state power minister M M Mani clarified that renewing the NOC was a natural process and it doesn’t mean the project will be commissioned overnight.At the same time, Mani made it clear the government really wants to implement the project but nature-lovers are against it. “We are not in a tearing hurry. All stakeholders will be taken into confidence. Activism is fine but it should not be at the cost of the state’s development,” said the minister. When asked about the opposition to the project from the CPI, he said the media had better ask the party’s leaders about this.The hydel project along the famous Athirapally Waterfalls, a favourite getaway and sought after shooting location of Bollywood, was conceived in the early 1980s when the state was reeling under a severe power crisis but got shelved due to stiff opposition from conservationists. In 2010, then environment minister Jairam Ramesh said no to the project adding Athirapally was another Silent Valley and the project was a sure recipe for disaster.There was a demand to build a similar dam in the Silent Valley rain forests in Palakkad also but former Prime Minister Indira Gandhi had scuttled it after scientist M G K Menon submitted a report saying it will destroy the rich biosphere. Today Silent Valley National Park is one of the largest tropical rain forests in the Western Ghat mountain ranges, a favourite habitat of lion-tailed macaque and elephants.Athirapally project with an installed capacity of 163 mw was planned along Chalakudy River - it will spread to 6.7 km upstream from Athirappilly Waterfall to Vazhachal Waterfall, both well known tourist destinations. Votaries of the project argue it will be built without disturbing the course of the waterfall and surrounding lush green areas but opponents say it will deliver a death blow to the picturesque landscape and submerge large tracts of forests and displace many tribal families.The 145-km long Chalakudy River that flows through three districts - Palakkad, Thrissur and Ernakulam -- before joining the Arabian Sea has many small and big dams and it cannot withstand more, green activists claim.“It seems the state has failed to learn a lesson from two consecutive floods that claimed many lives -- its greed is not on the decline. It has kept its eyes peeled on some of the remaining green cover. Votaries of the new dam should think about the upcoming generation also,” said Dr V S Vijayan, an environmental scientist who was in the team of Madhav Gadgil, who had prepared a report to save the fragile ecology of the Western Ghats.Besides the green landscape many tribal families are living along the fringes of the forests and they also face evacuation if the dam is built. “They will have to kill us before building the dam. It is a ploy to plunder green cover and destroy the serene waterfall,” said Kadar tribe leader P Kaliappan. The thunderous waterfall has in the past featured in many Hindi films like Raavan, Bahubali and Dil Se among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-s-no-objection-certificate-to-hydel-project-leads-to-outrage-among-green-activists/story-IYG8gIH8T8i87ZxDMo5I2J.html

The Haryana government, through HSVP, allotted 53 acres of land in Gurugram’s Sector 38 along the Delhi-Jaipur road (NH-48) for the development of The Medicity.An official statement by Medanta Hospital authorities on Gurugram Police’s FIR said: “This complaint has been filed by a person, who claims to be an RTI activist. However, it has been reported in the press that he has had an FIR for extortion registered against him. All the allegations in this complaint are completely false, baseless, and motivated.”Sharma had alleged that Medanta, in connivance with government officials, obtained pecuniary advantage as “land meant for institutional purposes was used for pure commercial, speculative and self-service purposes”, and several acres of land were allotted at undervalued rates.Sharma also alleged that the accused obtained occupational certificates based on misrepresentation, as there was no area on the premises that was allocated for medical and paramedical education, as advertised.Dr. Trehan has reacted to Sharma’s charges.“The allegations in Raman Sharma’s complaint pertain to the 16-year-old land allotment on which the hospital is built. Everything about this land allotment, which was done through a public auction, is legal. The allegations are nothing short of absurd. We’ve built one of the finest hospitals in this part of the world, and we’re proud of the work we do. Sharma has chosen to file this complaint to harass me amid a global pandemic. I’m continuing to tend to my patients despite being over 70 and putting myself at a risk because of the pandemic. It’s of grave concern and hurt that doctors and hospitals are bearing the brunt of harassment by people of dubious antecedents,” Dr. Trehan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-books-medanta-hospital-md-naresh-trehan-in-money-laundering-case/story-2f6uyarcO2d135My0CiUBK.html

Locals say the authorities should restart the electric crematorium in the city which is safer, cost-effective and environment friendly too. The electric crematorium has not been used for the past several years. Locals fear that cremating bodies of people who died of Covid-19 could lead to community transmission of the disease.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.The electric crematorium at Khadkhadi ghat operated for over two decades. But rising maintenance costs and people choosing funeral pyres for traditional last rites eventually lead to the crematorium being abandoned.Kankhal Cremation Ghat Managing Committee president Ram Kumar Mishra said priests are now apprehensive of conducting last rites of Covid-19 casualties. “Those who perform last rites are still apprehensive about funeral pyres in the open. So electric crematorium is a necessity now as it is a much safer option for the cremation of such suspected cases”, he said.Taking cognizance of local people, particularly those residing near Khadkhadi and Kankhal cremation ghats openly opposing the funeral rites of Covid-19 casualties and those suspected to have of the virus in the past few weeks, the municipal corporation is now contemplating restarting electric crematorium at Khadkhadi ghat.According to Haridwar town commissioner Narendra Singh Bhandari, the proposal for restarting electric crematorium first needs to be put up at the civic body meeting and after the board passes it, a decision can be taken to restart the crematorium.Citing a lack of awareness as well as adherence to the custom of traditional funeral rites among the majority of people who don’t prefer electric crematoriums, Khadkhadi Cremation Ghat Managing Committee vice president Jagat Singh Rawat said that in initial years only unknown and unclaimed bodies were cremated in the electric crematorium.“Operational and maintenance cost of the electric crematorium spiked as most people preferred traditional funeral pyre. This led to the closure of electric crematorium but keeping in mind the spread of Covid-19 we have already cleaned and sanitized the electric crematorium here,” said Jagat Singh Rawat.Haridwar chief medical officer Dr Saroj Naithani said that as per Central government guidelines, the body of a Covid-19 patient can be cremated at any type of crematorium.“The body, as well as plastic sheet, is sanitized and then only handed in a special plastic bag and due precaution is taken while performing last rites”, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fear-of-covid-19-sparks-demand-for-electric-crematorium-in-haridwar/story-BEiBezCt3fP0TQ2kOlpL7L.html

The doctors boycotted work on Wednesday and squatted on the hospital premises while raising slogans demanding protection and action against the culprits.The doctors even refused an invitation to the state secretariat for talks by Andhra health minister Eatala Rajender, following which, the minister himself arrived at the hospital in the afternoon to meet the agitating doctors.Meanwhile, Hyderabad police commissioner Anjani Kumar said the police, immediately after the incident, arrested two people for the alleged assault on the doctors at the hospital.“Under any circumstances, an attack on medical staff will not be tolerated. Most firm and stringent legal action will be taken.

10-06-2020||India||Setting an example: Men in khaki don PPE kits to conduct last rites of Covid-19 patient in Assam||A superintendent of police (SP) in a district in Assam and his three other staff exchanged their khaki uniforms for personal protective equipment (PPE) kits on Tuesday to conduct the last rites of a coronavirus disease (Covid-19) victim in a bid to set an example of precautionary measures against the raging pandemic.Debojit Deori, SP, Karbi Anglong, his two bodyguards and a driver were left to perform the last rites of a 54-year-old person, the first Covid-19 victim in the district, after mounting local resistance because of the social stigma and a growing panic against the viral infection.The victim, who had returned from Chennai in May, had died at the medical college hospital in Diphu, the headquarters of Karbi Anglong district, on Sunday.However, his last rites were performed two days later because of the opposition from the locals and a delay in locating a suitable place to bury the dead.“Nobody was willing to perform the victim’s last rites because of lack of awareness among the locals. His last rites were performed at a place, which is not usually used for cremation, as local people were scared of contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19,” said Deori. “Ultimately, we decided to step in, as someone had to set an example and perform the last rites with proper dignity. We performed the last rites at Bokoliaghat, around 50 kilometres from Diphu. A family member conducted the rituals before the burial,” the SP added.Deori has sent his aged mother to his native place, as a precautionary measure, and he has also quarantined himself at home. The other three persons, who helped the SP to conduct the victim’s last rites, have also gone under home quarantine.“Someone had to perform the last rites, as we couldn’t have kept the body for long and he had to be given a decent send-off. We also needed to show it to the people that as long as you use the necessary safety measures, there’s nothing to fear about the viral outbreak,” said Deori.There have been instances of delays and problems in disposing bodies of Covid-19 patients at several places across the country.Similar problems were reported after Assam’s first Covid-19 death in the Barak Valley’s Hailakandi district and the first fatality in neighbouring Meghalaya in April.“We couldn’t conduct the last rites at the two places chosen earlier, as the public was panic-stricken. Sanitary workers were also unwilling to take part in conducting the last rites. Finally, it was performed close to a public cremation site near the deceased’s residence,” said Mukul Kumar Saikia, deputy commissioner (DC), Karbi Anglong.“I’m thankful to SP Deori and the other men who came forward to conduct the last rites to set an example. He and the other three men are in quarantine for a few days as a preventive measure,” he added.Assam has recorded five Covid-19 related deaths till Wednesday. Over 3,000 Covid-19 positive cases have been recorded in the state and nearly 1,100 patients have recovered to date.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/setting-an-example-men-in-khaki-don-ppe-kits-to-conduct-last-rites-of-covid-19-patient-in-assam/story-Y2nfGxburvZFAP23GNtZFK.html

Some people were walking more than 10 km, hence we decided to launch a program to provide financial services. We also want elderly population to remain indoors during this pandemic,” said Deepak Soni, District Collector, Dantewada.Soni said that due to technological advancements, it is possible to bring all banking facilities at the people’s doorstep.A team of volunteers, “The ‘Danteshwari Mai Mitan’, is helping the people of the district to provide them pension and other banking benefits,” Soni added.The Collector said that the 70 volunteers in the Mitan team have been drawn from community service centres (CSC) and village level entrepreneurs (VLE), who then reach out to the Maoist-hit villages of the district. Most part of Dantewada has no internet connection and hence manual payment has also been made for helping tribals.“Digital payment techniques are used where there is internet while manual payments are made in the forest villages where there is no internet connectivity,” said the Collector.Lauding the initiative, Aayati Nag, 65, said earlier she had to travel five-six km to the nearest bank in Kuakonda from her village in Maharapara for her old-age pension, but things have changed now.“Due to the lockdown it was very difficult to reach the bank but a few days ago some district official came and handed over my pension money at my home,” said Nag.A senior official of the district said since Danteswahri Mitans are locals, they are not obstructed by Maoists and they know the terrain also.Similarly, Mora Devi of Chitalanka village said that due to the lockdown there were long queues in banks and hence it was very difficult. “I had to walk about 4 km and then stand in the queue,” she said.“No one could have imagined banking would be so easy and I am happy to be a part of this service, that is bringing smiles to people,” said Prembati, a Dantewada Mitan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-chhattisgarh-s-maoist-hit-dantewada-bank-services-at-tribals-doorstep/story-BQCIHzT5BSlbFMhKdcttmI.html
10-06-2020||India||Jharkhand’s first round of mapping shows 70% of migrant workers are skilled||The skill mapping of 2.5 lakh out of the five lakh migrant workers who returned to Jharkhand from different states has revealed that most are skilled and majority of them were engaged in construction, automotive and electronics sectors, government officials said on Wednesday.The exercise is being carried out on the instructions of chief minister Hemant Soren so that workers could be provided employment opportunities according to their skills. But economists are skeptical that the government would be able to provide jobs to all of them. In the first round of skill mapping, Jharkhand government has mapped the skills of 2,50,056 inbound migrant workers till now. Of those surveyed, 1,77,186 or 70% returnees are skilled labourers, while the rest 72,871 are unskilled workers, according to the state government’s assessment.According to the Jharkhand government records, about seven lakh workers, stranded outside the state had registered with the government to return home. Till now, over five lakh migrant workers have returned to Jharkhand since May 1.Jharkhand is among several states such as Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Odisha, which have carried out skill mapping of migrant workers in a bid to provide them work within their respective states after their return. The skill of labourers was mapped by dividing them into 52 trades which were further subdivided into 14 sectors. According to first round mapping, a total of 49,942 workers were engaged in various construction works and included painters, masons and carpenters.As many as 34,757 workers have experience in the automotive sector, 22,238 workers in logistics, 21,054 in electronics, 17,291 in apparel, 15,692 in tourism and hospitality and 11,511 in the healthcare sector. Besides, 17,768 workers have experience in beauty wellness, capital goods, financial services, information technology, plumbing, retail and security. But providing job opportunities to such a large scale of migrant returnees will be a major big challenge for the Jharkhand government, said Belgium-born economist Jean Dreze.“I don’t expect the Jharkhand government to provide much employment to skilled workers from its own funds. If it has no money to pay its own employees, how is it going to employ large numbers of extra workers?” Dreze said.Dreze said, “A fair amount of skilled work could be generated under MGNREGS in the form of gram rozgar sevaks, assistant engineers, field assistants, social auditors, computer operators and others. This could also include skilled work for masons and others at worksites. This will also have multiplier effects in the form of helping to increase the overall scale of MGNREGS.” Migrant workers who returned, have already started pleading for jobs for survival. The workers said they would not go back to their workplaces if the Jharkhand government provides them employment.Guddu Yadav, who returned from Tirunelveli in Tamil Nadu to Jharkhand’s Palamu district said, “I used to work in a tyre company there and earn Rs 10,000 to Rs 12,000 a month. We migrated to other states only to earn livelihood for family members. If I get a job here, I would not like to move out of the state,” he said.Another migrant worker, Etoram Tudu, who returned from Kerala, said he has experience in fabrication work. “But, I am ready to work even in MGNREGS. I do not want to go outside leaving my mother alone here,” said Tudu, a resident of Gomia in Bokaro district.Aradhana Patnaik, secretary of the Jharkhand rural development department which carried out the skill mapping said most of the workers would be accommodated in rural development schemes.“The department has chalked out some short and long-term plans for these migrant workers. Bulk workers would be accommodated in various rural development schemes such as MGNREGS and national rural livelihood mission.”She said work demand in MGNREGS has increased more than double in the past fortnight. “On an average, 3-3.5-lakh workers work in MGNREGS per day. However, the workers count reached 6.6-lakh on Tuesday. More than one lakh migrant workers who have completed 14-day quarantine have been engaged in MGNREGS jobs. Many skilled labourers are willing to work in MGNREGS.”Patnaik said the mapping data would be shared with other departments including industry, urban development and information technology and they would also create job opportunities according to the skill of the workers.However, Harishwar Dayal, a Jharkhand- based economist, said, “Providing jobs to all the migrant workers is not an easy task for the government. MGNREGS jobs are not permanent and remuneration is also very poor. Private players will have to pitch in to accommodate skilled workers.”He expects entrepreneurs to make the most of cheap labour in Jharkhand. “I think private players and entrepreneurs would come to Jharkhand to cash in on the opportunity, as they would get labour at a cheap price right now. Industries would also try to pick the skilled workers for their needs.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-s-first-round-of-mapping-shows-70-of-migrant-workers-are-skilled/story-t2IXHB0cOBwTZh4m3XLf2N.html

Taking to Twitter, Tharoor said that the farmers’ condition is worsening due to the “unplanned lockdown”. “The condition of our farmers is worsening thanks to the unplanned #lockdown & completely broken supply chain. Last harvest didn’t yield good monetary value since farmers unable to sell,” Tharoor’s tweet read.The minister also added that the economic packages provided by the government have given nothing to the farmers. “They need help!” he posted.Also read: Covid-19: Number of recoveries exceed active cases for first timeThe condition of our farmers is worsening thanks to the unplanned #lockdown & completely broken supply chain. Last harvest didn't yield good monetary value since farmers unable to sell. They are heavily in debt &Govt's package provides them nothing. They need help! #किसान_के_बोलTharoor called for the elimination of the middlemen who he said “are profiting at the expense of our sweat-stained farmers”. “Why should they buy the farm products and exploit both growers and consumers?” he questioned. The Congress leader said that the Food Corporation of India should purchase directly from farmers. The move will “give the aam aadmi cheaper food if parasitical middlemen are eliminated!” he said. Tharoor’s comments came on the sidelines of the Kisan Congress’ ‘Kisan Ke Bol’ social media campaign to raise the voice of the farmers.Last month, while announcing the details of Rs 20 lakh crore economic relief package, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman focussed on funding big-ticket reforms in the agricultural sector.The government recently amended the Essential Commodities Act to enable better price realisation for farmers, resulting in deregulation of prices for foodstuffs including cereals, edible oils, oilseeds, pulses, onions and potatoes.“Farmers can now export or store these commodities as they wish. These are our farmers’ demands pending for nearly 50 years now,” Union minister Prakash Javadekar said while making the announcement earlier this month. “As a result of this, farmers will get good returns,” the minister said, adding that farmers will now be able to sell their produce anywhere and to the highest paying party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unplanned-lockdown-is-worsening-farmers-condition-shashi-tharoor/story-UtvXzG1HC4BRHU9SoyiY0M.html
10-06-2020||India||Delhi Lt Guv may rope in experts for help to ramp up beds for Covid-19 patients||Lt Governor Anil Baijal is learnt to have favoured setting up an expert panel for a quick but detailed prognosis of the coronavirus disease in national capital Delhi to get a clearer picture of its spread over the next few weeks and months. Baijal also wants the experts to guide how the city could rapidly ramp up beds available for Covid-19 patients without compromising on the quality of medical care to patients, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.Baijal’s push to seek expert advice comes after a panel set up by the Arvind Kejriwal government indicated that the city’s Covid-19 count could exceed 5 lakh by July 31.The state’s health department has estimated that the city would need 80,000 beds to treat serious patients by the end of July. Patients who have mild symptoms are advised to isolate themselves at home.In contrast, Delhi has all of nearly 58,000 hospital beds in the government and private sector.As on Tuesday, Delhi had 8,892 hospital beds for Covid-19 patients, 582 ICU beds, 507 ventilators beds and 3,590 oxygenated-supported beds in Covid-designated hospitals.The Aam Aadmi Party government had appointed an expert panel in the early stages of the coronavirus disease. The worst-case scenario that this panel had asked the government to prep for was 1,000 new Covid-19 cases every day.Also read | ‘Delhi L-G Baijal’s orders to be implemented’: CM Kejriwal on hospitals rowSome experts have told the government that the city could expect twice as many cases next week.It was on account of concerns around the projected spike in Covid-19 cases that Arvind Kejriwal’s cabinet had attempted to shut the doors of the city government’s hospitals to patients from outside Delhi.That order was, however, overruled by Anil Baijal who cited Supreme Court rulings that right to health is an integral part of right to life.Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodi had severely criticised the Lt Governor for this decision yesterday. Today, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said in a video statement that his government would completely abide by Anil Baijal’s decision and moved ahead to battle Covid-19.Set up electronic dashboardsBaijal has, to help patients running around searching for hospital beds, decided to issue orders to all hospitals to install an electronic dashboard at the entrance that would list the occupied and available beds for Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 patients. The dashboard, which would have to be updated in real time, would also feed hospital beds data to a central control unit to be set up in the Divisional Commissioner’s office.The government had earlier required hospitals to set up flex board at the entrance that would ask patients to download the Delhi Corona mobile app or check the website, www.delhifightscorona.in/beds, set up by the government to check availability of beds.But there have been many complaints that hospitals would indicate that the beds were available, only to turn back patients.Also read | ‘Around 30,000 more Covid-19 cases likely in next 12-15 days’: Delhi health minister||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-lt-guv-may-rope-in-experts-for-help-to-ramp-up-beds-for-covid-19-patients/story-otqpCl9mwELKmO4cEPHQNM.html
10-06-2020||India||On Rahul Gandhi’s China query, Union minister’s advice to Congress leader||Questions on international matters are not to be answered on social media platforms, pointed out Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad in pithy advice to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi’s constant probing of the China question.“Rahul Gandhi should know that on international matters, like China, questions should not be asked on Twitter. He is the same man who asked for evidence after the Balakot airstrikes and 2016 Uri attack,” Ravi Shankar Prasad was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. The Congress leader has been tweeting, seeking answers from the Central government on the China aggression in Ladakh. Earlier today, the former Congress president, stepping up the attack, targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s silence on the issue. “The Chinese have walked in and taken our territory in Ladakh. Meanwhile The PM is absolutely silent and has vanished from the scene,” he tweeted.The latest salvo comes even as the Chinese troops at the four standoff points in Ladakh have started thinning out. A Major General-level meeting is also scheduled between the two sides to work out the mechanics of scaling down troops on both sides of the Line of Actual Control.On Tuesday, a group of retired officers of the armed forces deplored Rahul Gandhi’s statements on India-China border issue, terming them as ill-conceived and against national interest.“We, as a group of senior armed forces veterans, strongly deplore the ill-conceived and ill-timed statements and tweets of Rahul Gandhi questioning the handling of India-China border disputes by our armed forces and the Government of India,” the group of nine retired army officers, including Lt Gen Nitin Kohli, Lt Gen R N Singh and Maj Gen M Srivastava, said in a statement.His statements are “patently harmful to our national interest. In the past too, Rahul Gandhi and Congress leaders questioned the Indian armed forces’ ground and air strikes”, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-rahul-gandhi-s-china-query-union-minister-s-advice-to-congress-leader/story-p8i6X5JGyouickSnjA9imN.html
10-06-2020||India||Jama Masjid may have to be closed again due to deteriorating Covid-19 situation in Delhi: Shahi Imam||The historic Jama Masjid in Old Delhi is likely to be temporarily shut again amid fears over the spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, the mosque’s Shahi Imam Syed Ahmed Bukhari said on Wednesday, two days after it reopened because of the nationwide easing of lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from March 25 in a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19 outbreak. Bukhari is looking at temporarily shutting down the Jama Masjid because of the spike in Covid-19 positive cases in the national capital, which also led to a personal tragedy for him on Tuesday night, when his personal assistant for over 20 years, Amanullah (57), died at Safdarjung Hospital. “Amanullah was admitted to Safdarjung Hospital on June 3 after he had tested Covid-19 positive. He had a heart condition, diabetes, and also liver ailment. He was at home for the past three-four months, as he wasn’t keeping well,” Bukhari said. An official from the Shahi Imam’s office said on Tuesday night Bukhari had sought the opinion of the people on temporarily shutting down the Jama Masjid until the viral outbreak is reined in.“A message was circulated on Tuesday night seeking people’s opinion on the matter. Most people have been in favour of shutting down the mosque until the Covid-19 crisis blows over. People are airing their views on social media. A decision on this will be taken later in the day, as consultations are on and other mosques may also follow suit,” the official said.On Monday, around 200 people offered namaz at the Jama Masjid after it reopened following the easing of lockdown restrictions.“I’ve also urged other smaller mosques to appeal to people to offer namaz at home. All social gatherings should be strictly avoided, including for offering prayers, as they could turn out to be potentially lethal because of the viral outbreak,” said Bukhari.Delhi reported 1,336 new Covid-19 positive cases till Tuesday night, as the overall tally rose to 31,309, including 905 deaths, the health authorities said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jama-masjid-may-have-to-be-closed-again-due-to-deteriorating-covid-19-situation-in-delhi-shahi-imam/story-o8QuT5jr7ffe4e7q4tkSwL.html
10-06-2020||India||Widespread mask-wearing could prevent Covid-19 second waves, study shows||Population-wide facemask use could push Covid-19 transmission down to controllable levels for national epidemics and could prevent further waves of the pandemic disease when combined with lockdowns, according to a UK study published Wednesday.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe research, led by scientists at the Britain’s Cambridge and Greenwich Universities, suggests lockdowns alone will not stop the resurgence of the new SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, but that even homemade masks can dramatically reduce transmission rates if enough people wear them in public.“Our analyses support the immediate and universal adoption of facemasks by the public,” said Richard Stutt, who co-led the study at Cambridge.He said the findings showed that if widespread mask use were combined with social distancing and some lockdown measures, this could be “an acceptable way of managing the pandemic and re-opening economic activity” long before the development and public availability of an effective vaccine against Covid-19, the respiratory illness caused by the coronavirus.The study’s findings were published in the “Proceedings of the Royal Society A” scientific journal.The World Health Organization updated its guidance on Friday to recommend that governments ask everyone to wear fabric face masks in public areas where there is a risk to reduce the spread of the disease.In this study, researchers linked the dynamics of spread between people with population-level models to assess the effect on the disease’s reproduction rate, or R value, of different scenarios of mask adoption combined with periods of lockdown. The R value measures the average number of people that one infected person will pass the disease on to. An R value above 1 can lead to exponential growth. The study found that if people wear masks whenever they are in public it is twice as effective at reducing the R value than if masks are only worn after symptoms appear. In all scenarios the study looked at, routine facemask use by 50% or more of the population reduced Covid-19 spread to an R of less than 1.0, flattening future disease waves and allowing for less stringent lockdowns.“We have little to lose from the widespread adoption of facemasks, but the gains could be significant,” said Renata Retkute, who co-led the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/widespread-mask-wearing-could-prevent-covid-19-second-waves-study-shows/story-spFoW3FdS0ziAIz4WKcBzL.html
10-06-2020||India||Hearing plea against Mumbai Police’s ‘gag order’, high court asks a question||The Bombay high court on Tuesday sought to know if the Mumbai Police intended to extend the order it issued under Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) that made criticising the government and its functioning a punishable offence.The court was hearing a petition filed by Navi Mumbai resident and journalist Rajeev Mishra, challenging the May 23 order on the ground that it was violative of the freedom of speech and expression. Prohibitory orders under Section 144 are being issued right from the beginning of the nationwide lockdown in view of the Covid-19 pandemic and are being renewed from time to time. Mishra has complained that the order not only prohibited dissemination of fake news, incorrect information and other objectionable content on various social media platforms, but also specifically stated that legal action will be taken against those criticising the state and its functioning in the times of Covid-19.Amongst other directives, the order prohibits any person from inciting mistrust towards government functionaries and their actions taken in order to prevent spread of the disease, thereby causing danger to human health or safety or a disturbance to the public tranquility, the petition said. It specifically stated that any person contravening the order will be prosecuted under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), it added.According to Mishra’s counsel, this “gag” on public speaking against the state government’s functioning was completely in breach of freedom of speech and expression guaranteed by the Constitution and therefore liable to be struck down.However, when the petition came up for hearing on Tuesday, assistant public prosecutor Madhavi Mhatre pointed out that the order under challenge has expired on June 8, and the petition had become infructuous.The bench of justice Ujjal Bhutan and justice Riyaz Chagla sought to know if the police authorities intended to extend the gag by extending the order dated May 23 or by issuing similar order. The bench adjourned the petition till June 23 after the prosecutor sought time to answer the query.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hearing-plea-against-mumbai-police-s-gag-order-high-court-asks-a-question/story-6uOR60OtZqBTEjtV3Xv9oL.html

We may again shut it down for people and limit ‘namaz’ for a few people, in a day or two,” he said.The mosque had opened on June 8 after a gap of over two months with the government allowing further relaxations as part of “Unlock-1”, the first phase of a calibrated exit from the novel coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown. “I have also asked other smaller mosques to appeal to people to stay at home and offer ‘namaz’ instead of going to mosques for it. What is the point of visiting mosques at such a time when the spread of the coronavirus is peaking in Delhi, when we did not do so even during Ramzan and Eid due to the lockdown,” Bukhari said.As religious places along with several other establishments, like shopping malls and offices, opened across the country on June 8, Bukhari asked governments to reconsider their decision in view of the rapid spread of the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jama-masjid-might-close-again-in-view-of-deteriorating-covid-19-situation-in-delhi/story-queN5Sim0CgOpKZ1X0XU7N.html

But this, he said, had happened in the years that the Congress was in power at the Centre. Starting from 38,000 sq km of Aksai Chin in eastern Ladakh seized by China in the 1962 war.The 34-year-old Bharatiya Janata Party lawmaker went on to cite three occasions over the 12 years when, according to Namgyal, China had occupied Indian territory.“I hope @RahulGandhi and @INCIndia will agree with my reply based on facts and hopefully they won’t try to mislead again,” he tweeted along with his list of territories that had been occupied by ChinaWatch: Jamyang Tsering Namgyal Vs Rahul Gandhi on China-India faceoff  I hope @RahulGandhi and @INCIndia will agree with my reply based on facts and hopefully they won't try to mislead again.@BJP4India @BJP4JnK @sambitswaraj @JPNadda @blsanthosh @rajnathsingh @PTI_News pic.twitter.com/pAJx1ge2H1The Ladakh MP had shot to fame last year after he delivered an impassioned speech in parliament that underscored how his constituency had been neglected for decades by successive governments that ruled Jammu and Kashmir. Namgyal’s speech put the spotlight on Ladakh, a region that had traditionally been relegated to the background in most debates over the erstwhile state’s special status.Also Read: India, China disengage in three sectors at LAC.Namgyal’s rebuttal to Rahul Gandhi comes at a time the opposition has amped up its attacks on the government over some media reports that claimed Chinese troops had entered inside Indian territory during the ongoing standoff.Gandhi, however, continued to target the government. On Wednesday morning, he aimed at Prime Minister Narendra Modi. “The Chinese have walked in and taken our territory in Ladakh. Meanwhile The PM is absolutely silent and has vanished from the scene,” he tweeted.Gandhi’s fresh attack on Wednesday comes even as Chinese troops at the four standoff points in Ladakh have started thinning out. A Major General-level meeting is also scheduled between the two sides to work out the mechanics of scaling down troops on both sides of the Line of Actual Control.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-mp-delivers-biting-response-to-rahul-gandhi-on-china-occupied-territory/story-g4MAH2N8nfgsSoxZE5fO3O.html

10-06-2020||India||‘Delhi L-G Baijal’s orders to be implemented’: CM Kejriwal on hospitals row||Underscoring that it is not the time for disagreements, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Wednesday said Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal’s decision to not reserve hospitals exclusively for Delhi residents for Covid-19 treatment will be followed in “letter and spirit”. “L-G’s directives will be implemented in letter and spirit, this is not the time for disagreements or arguments,” said CM Kejriwal, who tested negative for coronavirus yesterday, at a virtual briefing.On Monday, L-G Baijal overruled the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government’s decision to reserve hospitals, except those run by the centre, for residents of Delhi. The state government’s decision to test only those showing symptoms of Covid-19 was also overturned, allowing asymptomatic cases and high-risk contacts of a virus patient to be tested. Watch | ‘Delhi will implement Centre’s decision on hospitals’: CM Arvind Kejriwal “We will try our best to make arrangements to provide treatment to all. We all have to fight Covid-19 together,” underlined CM Kejriwal, presenting a united front.The CM, however, did bring out the difficulty in providing beds for Covid-19 treatment, which he termed a “huge challenge” going by the estimates of the rise in coronavirus cases by July end.Baijal, overriding the Delhi government’s decision, drawing from various Supreme Court judgments had impressed upon the government that the right to health is an integral part of the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution. In a letter, the L-G’s office said that “Delhi belongs to all” and that none can be denied treatment for not being a resident of the national capital. According to the Delhi government’s projection, there will be 44,000 cases by June 15, one lakh cases by June 30 going up to 2.25 lakh cases by July 15 and 5.5 lakh cases by July 31.“Data shows Covid-19 cases will significantly increase in Delhi in coming days; we have a big challenge ahead,” said Kejriwal. The Centre has already ruled out any community transmission of Covid-19 in the national capital.The CM said the fight against coronavirus has to be turned into a “jan andolan (people’s movement)”, much like the odd-even scheme for vehicles in the city to combat pollution. He said we need to keep in mind three things: wearing masks, washing hands regularly and maintaining social distancing. The people, Kejriwal said, should encourage each other to follow this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/l-g-anil-baijal-s-orders-on-not-reserving-hospitals-for-delhi-residents-will-be-implemented-says-cm-kejriwal/story-hiv6fmeOJ4dNZocgsdIFsJ.html

Both used to work as firefighters with OIL and were engaged in controlling the well, which caught fire on Tuesday,” said an NDRF official.“Their bodies were found at 10 am from a pond close to the well. The bodies have been handed over to district officials.”On Tuesday, OIL announced in a statement that only one person, an employee of Oil and Natural Gas Commission (ONGC) working at the site, had sustained a minor injury when the fire broke out.The fire broke out a day after three experts from a Singapore-based firm, Alert Disaster Control, reached the site to try to plug the well.The Baghjan well witnessed the blowout while work was underway to produce gas from a new oil and gas bearing reservoir at a depth of 3,729 metres. A blow out is the uncontrolled release of crude oil or gas from a well when pressure control systems fail.Following the blow out, nearly 2,000 people living near the well were moved to four relief camps. Natural gas and condensate from the well had been flowing “uncontrollably” from May 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-firefighters-found-dead-near-assam-oil-well/story-UCwuX6LALc6tBL5cV9UA3L.html
10-06-2020||India||2 men engaged for painting job stole 4 hard disks from INS Vikrant, caught: NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Wednesday arrested two persons from Bihar in connection with the last year’s theft of four hard disks and other equipment related to sensitive data from INS Vikrant, the country’s first indigenously-built aircraft carrier, which is being readied in Cochin Shipyard Limited (CSL) for its commissioning next year.Both the accused were engaged in painting job at the vessel two years ago, NIA authorities said. More details are expected later in the day.Last September, the Kerala Police had registered a case on the basis of a complaint filed by the CSL general manager about the theft and later the probe was transferred to the NIA.The theft had raised serious concerns over a security breach and later a multi-agency probe began, headed by NIA.Four hard disks, memory cards, a processor, and other equipment were stolen from the high-security area after dismantling computers installed on the ship.The theft came to light after the information technology (IT) system developed a snag. There was no closed-circuit TV (CCTV)-led surveillance mechanism since work was still going on at the vessel.NIA authorities had collected fingerprints of over 1,200 people, including the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) and CSL employees, contractual workers, and others. The Central investigating agency had also announced a reward of Rs 5 lakh for any information about the theft, as the probe had appeared to have hit a dead end.Several agencies are involved in the building of the aircraft carrier, which is considered to be one of the prestigious defence projects of the country. The theft had not only embarrassed the defence sector, but there were also widespread apprehensions over the pilferage of sensitive data.The commissioning of INS Vikrant by next year will help India join an elite club of five countries, including the United States of America, Russia, China, the United Kingdom, and France, which have built their own carriers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ins-vikrant-theft-case-nia-arrests-two-persons-from-bihar/story-8mg6hzksVsn51CjvEo4wyN.html

It is an important link route connecting Kotdwar,” said the minister. In this regard, he instructed the officials to submit practical proposals and action plans for the construction of Lal Dhang-Chilarkhal motor road.He further said that the length and the width of the bridge to be made on the road should be re-evaluated.Also read: Our economy is tourism dependent... I don’t expect many visitors this year - Uttarakhand CMIn January, after going through the recommendations of the National Tiger Conservation Authority (NTCA) of building underpasses for animals and forest land transfer, the NBWL had approved the proposed road.The Standing Committee of the NBWL recommended the proposal for building the road through the buffer zone of Rajaji Tiger Reserve, an ecologically sensitive area in terms of movement of wildlife, with certain conditions.The conditions were, “Permission for starting the work on the project shall be granted by the state government only when road design is modified as per animal passage plan prepared by project proponent in consultation with state chief wildlife warden on the basis of the Wildlife Institute of India (WII) guidelines named Eco-friendly Measures to Mitigate Impacts on Linear Infrastructures on Wildlife.”The NTCA had recommended that as per the guidelines set by the WII, “construction of an elevated road (underpass for animals) with substantial clearance for elephants (8m above ground to provide safe passage) needs to be undertaken for the central stretch of 4.7 kilometres from Chamaraia bend to Siggadi sot.”The recommendations further mentioned that “While planning the elevated road, it should be ensured that at least 100 metres of passageways per kilometre is provided. However, being an elephant dense area, it is suggested to provide one and a half time more permeability which entails a permeable space of 705 metres.”The chief wildlife warden of Uttarakhand had then been asked to decide upon the exact location of the 705-metre structure in consultation with field unit and the WII, which can be broken down into smaller structures “with a span of not less than 50 metres at any given location.”Last year in July, the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) of the Supreme Court, after inspecting the Laldhang-Chillarkhal road, had observed that the road construction work violates the Forest (Conservation) Act of 1972.The committee had also found that the state forest department requires clearance under section 38 of the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 to go ahead with the project.The Supreme Court in June 2019 had put a stay order on all construction work underway on Laldhang-Chillarkhal road passing through what the court termed as an ‘ecologically sensitive’ area.The apex court made the judgment while hearing an application filed with the Central Empowered Committee (CEC) by Delhi-based wildlife activist Rohit Choudhury, ‘to stop construction of road, bridges and culverts’ on the said road.As an interim measure, PV Jayakrishnan, chairman of the CEC in his report stated, “that the construction work on the Laldhang-Chillarkhal road in the Rajaji Tiger Reserve may please be stopped forthwith as it would adversely impact the habitat and wildlife of the ecologically sensitive area.”After the inspection, the CEC in its report had recommended the apex court to direct the state to “withdraw the orders dated 7.12.2018 and 28.12.2018 issued without authority for transfer of forest land for non-forestry use to the State Public Works Department.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-govt-starts-work-to-construct-laldhang-chillarkhal-motor-road/story-ESCHoDYBD6Q6nxJwUHr25O.html

It further said that all necessary precautions and protocols should be followed.“It has now been decided to allow community kitchens, langar and serving of prasad at religious places subject to the conditions that physical distancing norms and all Covid hygiene precautions whie preparing and distributing food shall be strictly followed,” the order said.These places opened in most states on June 8 after the first phase of the relaxations (called Unlock 1) given by the central government came into force. Some of the temples, mosques and other places, however, remained closed on the first day.But the places which opened saw long queues as devotees showed up in a large number.The administration of various places of worship have put elaborate measures in place to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Many sites have disinfectant tunnels in place to ensure that the devotees are completely disinfected before entering the premises. Delhi’s Bangla Sahib Gurudwara is one of them.The Central government, in its guidelines issued last week, stated that all places of worship that open up will have to ensure social distancing is in place, and sanitise and screen devotees at regular intervals. It also put a bar on the number of people to five who will be allowed inside at a time. The guidelines also specifically mention that only asymptomatic people will be allowed inside these religious places.In line with the Centre’s guidelines, the Punjab government has not allowed cinema halls, gymnasiums, swimming pools, entertainment parks, bars theatres, auditoriums, assembly halls and similar places to open till June 30.

In a letter to Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, Baghel asked her to reconsider the Centre’s decision to link the increased borrowing limit of states to specific reforms, adding that the economic packages announced by the Centre to deal with Covid-19 crisis and the ensuing lockdown were insufficient to revive the economy. The chief minister said that considering the demand of states, the Centre has allowed an additional borrowing limit of 2 per cent of GSDP, but the state governments are unable to avail the benefit due to non-fulfilment of conditions and norms.“The problem of scarcity of resource remains unchanged for the states and the responsibility of the state government has increased even more as economic packages announced by the Centre to deal with the anomalous situation arising due to the Corona crisis and nationwide lockdown are also insufficient to revive the economy and meet the needs of the common people,” the CM wrote.The CM said that in present crisis it is the states’ priority to provide free food grains to the poor families, regular salary to the salaried people and proper health facilities for all. To provide relief to the people of the state, it is necessary to take prompt and effective action in this direction along with additional financial resources, he added.Baghel further said that automation of fair price shops including installation of POS machines in remote and forest areas is a difficult target for the state to achieve as 14 districts of Chhattisgarh are affected by LWE activities. Similarly, there are many technical hurdles in implementing the DBT system by ending the power subsidy being given to farmers in the agrarian state, he added. The chief minister said that although these reforms are quite important, this does not seem an appropriate time for these changes.“…In the present situation, it is more important that the state governments satisfactorily fulfil the immediate and primary responsibilities of public welfare and requested the union minister to allow the states to avail the additional borrowing limit and enhance their resources during the Covid-19 crisis without any conditions,” the CM said.As part of her final tranche on the Centre’s Rs 20 lakh crore economic stimulus package last month, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced that an increase in the borrowing limits of states from 3% to 5% of the Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) for the year 2020-21, subject to their carrying out specific reforms. Chattisgarh reported 14 new Covidd-19 cases on Tuesday, taking its total count to 1,211, PTI reported quoting a state health official. There are 859 active cases in the state while five people have died of Covid-19.

10-06-2020||India||Madhya Pradesh government to run liquor shops amid row with contractors||The Madhya Pradesh government started preparations on Tuesday to run liquor shops whose licences were surrendered by contractors amid a standoff between the two sides on reopening the vends.About 70 per cent contractors have surrendered their licences. They have refused to open their liquor vends for well over two weeks due to poor sale owing to the economic slowdown caused by the coronavirus outbreak. This had put them on a collision course with the BJP government in the state.The state government has now decided to run more than 1,000 liquor shops across the state till it finds new contractors in the rebidding process, as per officials.On Thursday, hearing petitions of liquor contractors, the Madhya Pradesh high court’s Jabalpur bench said that those who want to run the shops as per the state government’s rules should file an affidavit within three days. It allowed the state government to go for rebidding of the remaining shops.As per the officials of the state excise department, additional manpower is required to reopen and run the shops. It has asked the home guard department for assistance in smooth operation of these outlets. The revenue generated from these shops will be deposited in the sub-treasury of the district with the help revenue department officials. In his letter to director general of Home Guard, dated June 7, excise commissioner Rajiv Chandra Dubey said, “Execution of the (bidding) process after closure of liquor shops is expected to take 15 to 30 days. In the circumstances the department will have to run more than 1000 liquor shops. The department doesn’t have sufficient staff to run such a big number of shops. At the same time, the department has to take action to control (sale of) illicit liquor too. Hence, it is requested that home guards be made available to the districts as per their demands.”The places where liquor contractors surrendered their licences include major cities like Indore, Bhopal, Jabalpur, Gwalior too.An excise department official who didn’t want to be named said, “It will take at least 3 to 4 days in making all the preparations for running the shops in the entire state.”In state capital Bhopal, district collector Tarun Kumar Pithode issued an order on Tuesday for 32 shops which make country made liquor and Indian made foreign liquor (IMFL) to run. The shops will be run by the excise department personnel with a supervisor assigned to look after groups of two to four shops.Talking to mediapersons, Dubey said, “The process to run the shops has begun and these will be reopened by Tuesday evening or Wednesday morning.” The excise commissioner said that safety norms at the shops like social distancing, sanitisation etc would be ensured.The tug of war between the state government and the contractors has been going on for about a month. The contractors want the licence fees reduced given closure of shops due to Covid-19 and reduced sale after lockdown restrictions were lifted.Liquor shops opened in the state on May 7 after 45 days, but since the state government didn’t concede to the contractors demands to reduce the licence fee, about 30 contractors moved the high court.The state government was expected to have a revenue of about Rs 10,500 crore in the present financial year through auction of liquor shops.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madhya-pradesh-government-to-run-liquor-shops-amid-row-with-contractors/story-Q7twCMuxDtYG2TpgWK2gqN.html

The firm paid for their train tickets to resume construction work of the Polavaram multi-purpose project on Godavari River in Andhra Pradesh’s West Godavari district, company officials said on Tuesday. Another 1,800 would be brought back soon, they said.MEIL general manager, Satish Angana, said over 3,000 migrant workers had gone back to their native states like Bihar, Jharkhand and Orissa, compelling the company to continue works with the available meagre workers.Also read: Covid-19 cases spike in 6 states as migrants return“Till now, around 1,000 workers had been ferried back to Andhra Pradesh through Shramik Special trains at the company’s expenses. Another 1,800 workers are expected to be brought back shortly,” said another official who was not willing to be quoted. Angana said all these returning workers were tested at special medical camps and are allowed to work.Although the government has relaxed restrictions and allowed industries to reopen from May 3, the production has not increased much because of the shortage of labourers as workers left for their homes after the lockdown commenced from March 25. The Central government informed the Supreme Court last week that close to 10 million workers were sent back to their homes through special Shramik trains that started from May 1.However, as the industries and realty sector resumed operations in full swing from May 17, the employers tried to bring back workers, especially the skilled ones, who were needed to start the work. As workers expressed inability to return in the absence of enough trains, the employers tried to woo them, promising higher wages, better working conditions and even flight and train tickets. Bangalore-based Prestige Group has flown 10 carpenters from Patna to Hyderabad where it has taken up a major real estate project. “One of our contractors booked flight tickets for these 10 carpenters from Patna to Hyderabad. We have to complete the projects before the deadline fixed by the Real Estate Regulatory Authority and deliver the flats to the customers,” a senior vice-president of Prestige Group told a news agency.Bobby Jindal, owner of Balaji processors, a blanket manufacturing firm in Punjab’s Ludhiana, brought back seven of his master craftsmen by air from Patna.“I was left with less than 50 workers at my unit which adversely affected production. I booked air tickets for seven master workers who took a flight from Patna to Delhi and then from Delhi to Sahnewal Airport in Ludhiana last week,” Jindal said, adding that he had also arranged two taxis and booked train tickets for some of the other workers. “I have spent Rs two lakh on bringing 50 workers back in the last few days.”Rahul Verma, who runs a manufacturing unit in Ludhiana, brought his five highly skilled workers back from Bihar who were needed in the casting unit. “For some other workers, I have booked their tickets and paid them to return,” he said.In Rajasthan, from where workers go to other states looking for work, some industry owners have offered to arrange transport for workers to return. Sunil Jain president, Confederation of Real Estate Developers’ Associations of India (CREDAI), Rajasthan said the real estate and construction sector was facing a 30 to 40% shortage of labourers as a large chunk of labourers has returned home due to the scare of coronavirus and the lockdown. Most of the workers have returned to Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, West Bengal and Jharkhand.“I know of some real estate firms that are trying to get labourers back through contractors. Contractors are in touch with the workers and are convincing them to return, assuring them that they will get full work and wages. A few have even sent vehicles to ferry workers back and promised higher wages,” he said.Aseem Kumar, general secretary of the Garment Exporters Association of Rajasthan says the industry was facing up to 70% shortage of labourers and therefore, facing problems in meeting the delivery deadlines. “Some units have offered a 50% increase in wages to deliver pending orders. They are offering higher wages, accommodation and even promising work for the whole year but labourers are not ready to return,” he said, adding that a majority of garment exports from Rajasthan are for Japan, the US, Europe and South America.Charanjit Singh Vishwakarma, former President of United Cycle Parts Manufacturers Association (UCPMA) in Ludhiana, said he has already sent money to three of his labour contractors in Bihar to bring back workers. “As trains have not fully resumed, the workers are finding it difficult to get confirmed tickets to come via train. The government should start Shramik trains to bring them back,” he said.“Some factory owners have also offered higher salary for workers returning immediately. They are also paying for their train tickets,” Tarsem Jodhan, President of Punjab Mazdoor Union.To revive industrial production in the state, Punjab government last week sent two buses to Bihar and Uttar Pradesh to bring back workers. “I have arranged buses to bring back workers to industrial towns,” said Punjab Industries Minister Sham Sunder Arora, after a meeting with industrialists in Ludhiana on last Friday. Rajasthan government has offered to help the industry in getting labourers back from other states, provided industry bears the cost of transportation. Labour secretary, Niraj K Pawan said, “If the industry provides us details of districts from which they want the labourers back, we will coordinate with those states and facilitate the transport of the workers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-air-tickets-free-train-travel-to-higher-wages-employers-try-to-bring-back-migrant-workers/story-2lJWPSMriR3O9FnBZ1kjPO.html

However, to the best of the petitioner’s knowledge, no action has been taken by the special committee to consider the necessity and proportionality of the ongoing blanket mobile internet speed,” the plea said.The Supreme Court on May 11 directed constituted of the panel comprising high-level government officers to examine a separate plea for the restoration of the high speed 4G mobile internet services and the necessity to allow faster internet in certain areas.The NGO first approached the Supreme Court in April challenging the Jammu & Kashmir administration March 26 order restricting internet speed to 2G. It had sought restoration of the 4G internet services, saying patients, doctors, and the general public were unable to access the latest information, guidelines, advisories and restrictions about Covid-19 because of the low mobile internet speed.The mobile internet has been restricted to low-speed 2G services since the government eased a communications blackout imposed in August last year. The blackout was among a series of sweeping measures taken to prevent protests against the Centre’s move to divest J&K of its special status and to divide it into two Union territories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-seeks-action-against-govt-for-non-compliance-of-j-k-4g-order/story-seQw8RMIhdklZEHWKviWCL.html
10-06-2020||India||Amit Shah targets Mamata Banerjee on CAA, Covid-19||Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday asked the people of West Bengal to give Prime Minister Narendra Modi a chance for the state’s development as he hit out at chief minister Mamata Banerjee saying she would be relegated to a “political refugee” because of her opposition to the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA).“Change is needed to take Bengal ahead. People, who changed the communist rule expecting development, are now saying that even the communists were better than TMC. They are so upset. You gave communists 34 years and 10 years to Didi [Banerjee]. Now, give a chance to Modi...,” Shah said at his third virtual rally since Sunday. “I appeal to people to give Modi a chance for corruption and violence-free Bengal... you will see an end to violence, corruption, scams, extortion, terror, infiltration, and dynasty politics.” Shah said Banerjee’s “insensitive” reference to special trains for migrant workers as “corona express” would eventually seal her exit.TMC hit back and said BJP has misplaced priorities and was focusing on politics instead of battling Covid-19, dealing with the border stand-off with China and focussing on post-cyclone Amphan relief in West Bengal.“Covid-19 and cyclone Amphan are our focus. But since Shah raised the issue of CAA, we need to say a few things. The rules for CAA had to be notified within six months and the duration ends this week. Now they will seek another six months’ extension and revive the issue in December, which will be barely three months before the polls [in West Bengal]. They care for nothing other than votes,” TMC spokesman Derek O’Brien said.He said their government is faring better than other BJP-ruled states. “According to the report of Centre for Monitoring Indian Economy, the national unemployment rate is 23.5%, while in Haryana it is 35%, in Madhya Pradesh 27%, in UP 21%, and in Karnataka 20.4%, whereas Bengal has it at 17.4%.”TMC’s youth wing chief, Abhishek Banerjee, targeted the Centre over the border standoff. “As usual the speech of @AmitShah Ji was all rhetoric and no substance. Nonetheless, since he has talked about his dream of seeing ‘EXIT’ of TMC, I would like to ask him one more time - ‘When are the Chinese EXITING our territory’ #BengalRejectsAmitShah,” he tweeted.BJP emerged as TMC’s principal opponent in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls bagging 18 of the state’s 42 seats. TMC won 22. In the 2016 assembly polls, BJP won three of the state’s 294 seats, while TMC got 211.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-targets-mamata-banerjee-on-caa-covid-19/story-0YdrbkEhXKaaD1fyMevSIL.html
10-06-2020||India||IIT Bombay is India’s top university, says 2021 global ranking||The Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay, is India’s highest ranked university among top 200 global universities, with Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru, and IIT Delhi also figuring in the 200-bracket, according to the QS World University Rankings.The rankings for 2021 are based on six indicators: academic reputation, employer reputation, citations per faculty, faculty/student ratio, international faculty ratio and international student ratio, compilers of the rankings said.IIT Bombay is ranked 172nd, while IISc is 185th and IIT Delhi 193rd. Overall, 21 Indian higher education institutions figure in the top 1000. India’s best research university is IISc, which received a perfect 100/100 on the ‘citations per faculty’ indicator.Other IITs in the top 500 are: Madras (275), Kharagpur (314), Kanpur (350), Roorkee (383) and Guwahati (470).The compilers said that as a group, Indian higher education performs most strongly in measure of research quality, though its universities are failing to increase academic standing, teaching capacity, and levels of internationalisation at the same rate as global competitors.Ben Sowter of QS said: “Though India’s universities have dropped as a group this year, this is frequently because of other universities across the world making increasingly intense efforts to enhance their educational offerings”.“To regain lost ground, Indian higher education must find ways of increasing teaching capacity, and of attracting more talented students and faculty across the world to study in India. There is plenty of potential, and there are pockets of excellence, within the Indian system,” he added. Massachusetts Institute of Technology retains its position as the world’s best university, while the top three institutions remain American: MIT is followed by Stanford University (2nd) and Harvard University (3rd).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-bombay-is-india-s-top-university-says-2021-global-ranking/story-kADAErNt9myO4y46k67W6N.html
10-06-2020||India||Dalit boy killed over prayer at UP temple||Upper caste villagers allegedly shot dead a 17-year-old Dalit boy at Domkhera in Uttar Pradesh’s Amroha district on Saturday night following an argument over puja at a village temple, the teenager’s family said even as police maintained a dispute over money led to the murder. The teenager’s father said that his son and nephew had gone to the village temple on May 31, where one Horam Chauhan and his aides stopped them from offering puja. He added his son argued with them and later filed a police complaint on June 1. The father accused the police of inaction, claiming they did not act on his son’s complaint. He added on Saturday when his son was sleeping outside their house, Chauhan came with his aides and shot him dead. Three people, including Chauhan, have been arrested and raids were being conducted to arrest the other named accused, police said.Amroha police superintendent Vipin Tada insisted the dispute over money was the reason behind the killing. He said the boy’s brother and Chauhan had taken a mango orchard on contract and they parted ways after the dispute over money.  “There was a brief fight over it a few days ago,” added Tada.Police said a case has been registered under the Indian Penal Code’s Section 302 (murder) and under the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act against Horam Chauhan, Lala Chauhan, Jaiveer and Roshan. Horam Chauhan and Lala Chauhan were arrested on Sunday. Tada said that one Deepak, who was arrested on Monday, allegedly supplied the murder weapon to Horam Chauhan and the two killed the boy while he was sleeping under a tree.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dalit-boy-killed-over-prayer-at-up-temple/story-evS5ludyWjLWkJruO9Dk2J.html
10-06-2020||India||Expert clarifies on role of silent spreaders of coronavirus disease||A top World Health Organization (WHO) expert tried to clear up on Tuesday “misunderstandings” about comments she made that were widely understood to suggest that people without symptoms rarely transmit the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a comment that had immediately triggered scepticism from health experts around the world.Maria Van Kerkhove, the UN health agency’s technical lead on the pandemic, insisted that she was referring only to a few studies, not a complete picture, in the comments she made on Monday. On Tuesday, she said there were also studies that showed that the disease could be spread by asymptomatic careers.Van Kerkhove’s remarks on Monday raised questions among outside experts and health officials who have recommended that people wear masks to try to prevent the virus from spreading.“That’s a very small subset of studies,” she said. “I used the phrase ‘very rare’, and I think that that’s (a) misunderstanding to state that asymptomatic transmission globally is very rare. What I was referring to was a subset of studies.”The clarification, which came during a WHO social-media chat, showed questions remain about whether infected people who don’t show symptoms can transmit the virus to others. Critics of the agency have previously pointed to WHO’s position on wearing masks as an example of inadequate policy recommendations. The agency said for months that wearing masks would not contain the virus, a position that it changed last week.A second WHO official, in comments to HT, sought to make a distinction between asymptomatic and pre-symptomatic transmission. “Sars-CoV2 transmission is associated with high virus load in the upper respiratory tract. While a proportion of people (around 15 to 20%) are asymptomatic, most transmission seems to occur from those with symptoms. However, we have to be careful because people can be infectious one to two days before they develop symptoms, so right now it is important for everyone to wear face coverings when they cannot maintain physical distancing,” said Dr Soumya Swaminathan, chief scientist, WHO, Geneva.On Tuesday, prior to Van Kherkhove’s clarification, experts urged caution. “The knowledge gaps are there but there are too many contradictory statements from there WHO that are confusing countries, particularly those with limited technical capabilities. The latest statement about asymptomatic transmission being rare will create more confusion in an already volatile situation,” said K Sujatha Rao, former health secretary, ministry of health and family welfare.Dr Ashish K Jha, director at the Harvard Global Health Institute, said on Twitter some models “suggest 40-60% of spread is from people when they didn’t have symptoms”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/expert-clarifies-on-role-of-silent-spreaders-of-coronavirus-disease/story-wm9zvNBF2204gjkL5RJwYI.html
10-06-2020||India||Covid-19 cases spike in 6 states as migrants return||Six states — Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Odisha and Assam — that send a large number of migrant workers have shown a sharper rise in cases than the rest of the country, particularly over the last two weeks, data shows.While the total cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in these states have grown 8.2 times since May 1, cases in the rest of the country have grown only 7 times, according to an analysis by HT.The number of daily cases in these six states has seen a huge spike, particularly over the past few weeks when migrants started returning to their home states. All six states have seen a sharp rise over the past three weeks. The weekly average new cases in four of these states – Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Assam and Jharkhand – are currently at an all-time high. Only Bihar and Odisha are currently not at the peak of their outbreak, however they have not reported any significant downturn in new cases as well.Also Read: India, unlocking, is among 15 high-risk nations: StudyTo be sure, these states have also increased their daily testing in the same time period and almost all of the country has seen a major spike in cases in this period as well. So in order to remove these factors from our analysis, we also looked at how the share of cases in these states has changed in the national Covid-19 tally (Chart 2).While these states were contributing 10.5% of total cases in the country on May 1, this number has since increased to almost 12% by June 8. In fact, only 8% of new cases reported across the country in the week between May 1 and May 7 came from these six states. This number has since doubled to 16% in the week between June 2 and June 8. Their share of deaths in the total toll, meanwhile, has grown from 7.4% between May 1 to May 7 to 10% in the week between June 2 and June 8.Finally, we look at the rate of the spread of the virus in the six states (Chart 3). In order to keep comparisons between these states uniform and to compare different stages of the outbreak, we have taken Day 1 as the first day each state reported over 100 cases.We see that four of these states – Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal, Bihar and Odisha – have charted very similar trajectories since the time they crossed 100 total cases. The rate of increase started rising only after 30 to 40 days since the start of the larger outbreak. Assam, meanwhile, paints an alarming picture. Only 22 days since reporting its 100th case, the north eastern state has reported close to 3,000 cases. Only Uttar Pradesh (1,337 cases by Day 22) reported more than 800 cases in the same time period.  Jharkhand has been relatively safe. It is the only state among the six considered that has seen a very gradual increase in cases (as can be seen in Chart 3). Forty-three days since it reported its 100th case, Jharkhand reported 1,290 cases. In the same time period, the remaining states had at least two to three times the total number of cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-cases-spike-in-6-states-as-migrants-return/story-KdaJIXm3QF3FzOYVxIGBpM.html
10-06-2020||India||Migrant workers must be sent home in 15 days, says Supreme Court||States and Union territories received a time-bound mandate on Tuesday from the Supreme Court to ensure the return of all migrant workers stranded by the post-coronavirus lockdown to their home states within a fortnight and to inform the apex court within the same deadline about welfare programmes, including job opportunities, they plan to offer the returnees. A three-member bench of the Supreme Court, headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan and comprising justices SK Kaul and MR Shah, is expected to pass directions on the matter on July 8, the next date of hearing.To mitigate the plight faced by the migrants, the Supreme Court asked states and Union territories to identify migrant workers who have returned at the district and block levels and prepare an inventory of the vocational skills they possess and their employment history. In addition, they were asked to set up counselling centres to provide the workers information on welfare schemes and employment avenues that are open to them; they will also have to advise workers who want to go back to where they were employed.Millions of workers and daily-wage earners left the big cities and returned to states such as Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal in the aftermath of the lockdown enforced on March 25 to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).These directions follow the May 28 order whereby the court took suo moto (Latin for on its own) cognizance of the hardships faced by migrants returning to their villages. After going through the responses of all states/UTs on the transport of the migrant workers, the bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah said: “Police officers of states, paramilitary forces wherever deployed are doing a commendable job but some instances of excess with regard to migrant labourers are also there.”The court asked the states/UTs to consider withdrawing all prosecution proceedings or complaints lodged against the returning workers for violating the lockdown and norms of social distancing enforced under Section 51 of the Disaster Management Act.The court also noted lapses on part of the states and central agencies in implementing welfare schemes as pointed out in intervention applications filed by non-government organisations and individuals. The court said in its 38-page order, “We impress on States and Union Territories to streamline the vigilance and supervision of actions of their officers and staff and take appropriate action where required.”On the transportation of migrant workers, the court was convinced that much of the task had been completed, barring in Delhi, Maharashtra, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat where some migrants are still stranded. The bench said: “We direct that all the States/Union Territories to transport all stranded workers by train, bus or other mode within 15 days from today.” So far, some 9.8 million migrants have been transported by rail and road across the country beginning May 1. Some 171 trains are still lined up for shifting the remaining, still stranded migrants until June 16. The court directed Indian Railways to arrange Shramik Special trains within 24 hours of request by states.Finding gaps in the registration of migrants (in difficulties they face while filling up the registration forms such as language barriers), the court called for a “decentralizing” of the process of registration by providing this facility to stranded migrant workers at police stations and other places of local administration. In addition, states/UTs were asked to publicise journey dates of special trains and buses in local newspapers and television channels.Once they arrive at their destinations, the court directed states to gather details of migrant workers, the nature of their skill, and place of their earlier employment at the village level, block level and district level. Counselling centres would provide these migrants information about government schemes and avenues of employment so that this workforce can be utilised as a resource, the bench said.A list of all such schemes, including employment has to be tendered by Centre and states to the court in two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-must-be-sent-home-in-15-days-says-supreme-court/story-YQsRZroVlJFzUdw2GaTgCL.html
10-06-2020||India||Delhi likely to have 550,000 Covid-19 cases by July 31: Govt||A day after Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal revoked the Delhi government’s order to reserve beds in its hospitals for Delhi residents, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said the Capital is likely to have 550,000 Covid-19 cases by July 31, for which 80,000 beds would be needed, and accused the L-G of not having “any plan” for the surge in hospital admissions. The Delhi government also expressed its disappointment over the Centre not declaring that the Capital has reached the community transmission stage, even as health minister Satyendar Jain said they are unable to establish contact tracing in almost 50% of the Covid cases being recorded.The issue of hospital beds turned into a war of words, with the L-G releasing a statement late evening, in which he said that rather than “discriminating between patients, the goal of the government should be to plan and prepare for adequate infrastructure”. “We are all Indians and Delhi belongs to all!” the L-G’s statement read.Kejriwal, in a digital press briefing on Sunday, announced that hospitals under the Delhi government and some private ones will be reserved for the people of Delhi till the Covid-19 crisis subsides. The order was overruled by the L-G on Monday saying that ‘right to health’ has been held as an integral part of ‘right to life’ under the Constitution by the Supreme Court — a point which the L-G office on Tuesday said was clarified to Sisodia and health minister Jain during Tuesday’s meeting of the state disaster management authority (SDMA). At the meeting, which was chaired by the L-G, Sisodia urged Baijal to reconsider his decision.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who is the vice-chairperson of the authority empowered Sisodia to attend the meeting since he was down with Covid-like symptoms, though his test result which came out in the evening was negative. After the meeting, Sisodia told reporters, “We asked the L-G about his predictions on the increase in Covid cases in the coming days. We also asked him how many cases might come from outside. But, he had no answers. We also asked if people from outside come to Delhi, then how many beds would be needed. He had no answer to that as well.”He said, there was, however, a consensus that considering the current doubling rate of 12.6 days, around 5.5 lakh cases are expected in the state by July 31 and 80,000 beds will be needed at that time. “The prediction is based from the time when the borders were sealed due to lockdown and only residents of the state were coming for the treatment in Delhi hospitals. It was considering the surge in Covid cases that the Delhi Cabinet decided to reserve Delhi government and private hospitals for those living in the Capital. Now the decision of opening the hospitals for all will create a lot of obstacles for the people of Delhi,” Sisodia said. Jain said that any given point of time, nearly 50% of patients treated in Delhi’s private hospitals are from outside the state and that in government hospitals, the proportion goes up to nearly 70%. “During the lockdown in both private and government hospitals, the occupancy of people from outside was 10% and only the planned surgeries were happening. This could have been continued for some time but the L-G has not agreed to this,” he said. The L-G responded by saying he is “fully aware” of the need to ramp up medical infrastructure. “In fact, from time to time several ideas and strategies have been discussed in the SDMA meeting chaired by the L-G to augment the medical infrastructure to meet the rising requirement… In today’s SDMA meeting also, ideas e.g. use of spaces like Indira Gandhi Indoor Stadium, Tyagraj Stadium, JLN Stadium, Pragati Maidan to make large makeshift medical facilities were discussed. It was also decided to utilize banquet halls, marriage places, etc. to ramp up the facilities,” the L-G’s office said.Baijal has also advised the officers concerned to invoke Section 50 of Disaster Management Act, 2005 for expeditious procurement and timely setting up of required infrastructure, it further said. The SDMA meeting also saw a lack of consensus between the Delhi government and the Central government officers over the issue of community spread in Delhi.“The Central government officials present in the meeting said it has not happened yet in the city. So, there is no need to discuss this matter,” Sisodia said.A city is said to have reached the community transmission stage once it is no longer possible to trace the source of infection. Health minister Jain said that the director of AIIMS, Dr Randeep Guleria, has also stated that there is a community spread in the containment zones of Delhi. “On behalf of the state government, we can only say that there is a significant spread but only the Central government can say if it is community spread or not,” said Jain.While health secretary Preeti Sudan did not respond on the matter, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan, during a recent interview to HT, has said that Delhi government wasn’t giving the true picture of the Covid situation with labs and doctors being threatened. “Hiding numbers will not do; you have to actively search for cases as part of covid containment strategy,” he said.Two members of a panel constituted by the government to aid in the augmentation of the city’s health care infrastructure said the L-G’s decision to make available beds in Delhi hospitals to those from all states will be detrimental. “The committee has said Delhi will need 40,000 beds by mid-July. These calculations are based solely on Delhi’s population and the number of cases being reported from the city every day. Now, if these facilities were to be utilised by people from neighbouring states, the government will need to arrange thousands more beds over and above the projected requirement,” Dr RK Gupta, a member of the committee and former president of the Delhi Medical Association, said.Dr Arun Gupta, a member of the committee and president of the Delhi Medical Council, said: “Health is a state subject and the government utilises the tax payers’ money on health care services. So a government’s primary responsibility is to the people of Delhi. The Delhi government order only kept aside Delhi government-run hospitals and some private hospitals for its residents; people from neighbouring states could still go to central government-run hospitals, hospitals run by civic bodies, or the super speciality private hospitals. Now, Delhi residents will be at a disadvantage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-likely-to-have-550-000-covid-cases-by-july-31-govt/story-qb5HpnRRZE4d4WE1r89uDI.html
10-06-2020||India||Fourth Delhi Police official dies as Covid-19 takes toll on front-line warriors||A 59-year-old Delhi Police sub-inspector (SI) died of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday morning, becoming the fourth city police personnel to succumb to the infection and spotlighting the turmoil within the force struggling with rising cases coupled with falling morale, long working hours and panic among the families of the front-line workers.Karambir Singh was posted as the driver of assistant commissioner of police (ACP) Seelampur, Saurabh Chandra, in the city’s northeast district. He developed mild symptoms in the last week of May, after which he remained in quarantine for three to four days, said deputy commissioner of police (northeast) Ved Prakash Surya. “Karambir’s testing report came positive on June 1. He was admitted to Army Base hospital the next day as he was symptomatic. He died during treatment. The ACP’s test was also done but his report is negative,” added Surya. Before Singh, two assistant sub-inspectors (ASIs), Shesh Mani Pandey and Vikram died on May 30 and May 31, respectively. Head constable Amit Kumar died on May 5. The two ASIs died during treatment at the Army Base hospital and they were symptomatic. The constable was confirmed to have contracted the virus after his death.Since April, at least 689 Delhi Police personnel have tested positive for the disease and the swift spread of the pathogen has forced authorities to seal at least four police stations. In many of these spots, mini outbreaks of the disease were reported – such as 25 personnel infected in Moti Nagar police station, 10 cases each at Jahangirpuri police station and at Chandni Mahal police station.A number of senior officers -- including deputy commissioner of police (north) Monika Bhardwaj and additional DCP (Shahdara) Rohit Rajbir Singh -- were also infected, but have recovered and returned to work. Bhardwaj said she visited city railway stations, where Shramik Special trains for migrant workers were operating, before developing a fever. “For the first five days, I had mild fever but when the temperature started increasing, I got the Covid-19 testing done. I remained in home quarantine and away from my family members and children after being tested positive,” she added.At the beginning of May, the number of cases in the force was 110. The near six-fold rise in one month has spooked junior ranks in the force even as senior officers insist that a foolproof standard operating procedure (SOP) on precautions and reporting virus symptoms has helped in managing the disease. Most of the cases have been reported from the northwest, central, northeast and west districts. “There are few areas which have reported more cases than others. We are taking all due precautions and are regularly advising our staff about the safety protocols against the pandemic. A detailed SOP was drawn way back all unit in-charges are advised to follow the same strictly,” said joint commissioner of police (northern range) Manish Kumar Aggarwal.Still, there are signs that the force is struggling to deal with the disease. On April 23, the department announced it will give ₹1 lakh to patients for treatment. But the amount was decreased to ₹10,000 in the third week of May after the number of cases spiked. The rising number of cases has triggered anxiety among the junior ranks and their families, said a top police official on condition of anonymity. “Many of our police station personnel were worried as they had to visit the containment areas. Some were concerned about their families. but we assured them that our department will take all necessary steps for our well-being,” the officer said.To deal with rising stress and anxiety in the force, Delhi Police commissioner SN Shrivastava ordered in April that 33% of staff in police stations and other units would be sent off duty for 10 days on rotation, with preference given to those above 50 or with co-morbidities. But this may not be enough.The Delhi Police comprises 80,000 personnel, roughly 70% of which are engaged in Covid duties that kicked in soon after the government imposed a nationwide lockdown on March 25 to arrest the disease’s spread. These duties included enforcing the lockdown, stopping people from stepping out in containment zones, keeping a check on people in home quarantine and in quarantine centres and feeding migrant workers who were on the roads. A second top police officer said the manifold duties meant that work hours soared and many personnel were working for 10-12 hours straight, often without adequate medical protection in the early weeks. “Our duty hours increased because of the multiple works. Though we feel proud being among the front-liners in the fight against Covid-19, our personal safety and safety of our family members always remain a major concern. Our fears increased and the morale came down when police officers we know personally are found positive but we have no choice but to deal with it,” said the officer. To be sure, the police also faces several allegations of excess force being used, especially on the poor and migrants. A third police officer who is the station house officer of a police station said the problems increased once the lockdown was relaxed as crime soared and personnel frequented crime scenes that were sometimes inside containment zones or hot spots. “To solve cases and arrest suspects, we require multiple visits to various areas. This increases the infection risk,” the SHO said. Former Delhi Police commissioner Ajai Raj Sharma said police officers were more vulnerable to the infection as they are front-line workers. “Senior officers should regularly meet the constabularies to increase their morale,” he said. Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung hospital, said police personnel were more vulnerable to infection because they come in contact with a large number of people and no kind of social distancing is possible in policing. “Long working hours, little rest and improper diet increase their stress level and affects their immunity,” he added. To be sure, such problems have plagued police forces in other cities too. In Mumbai, which has 51,000 infections until now, the local police have seen 1,871 of their colleagues contract to the virus while many others have fainted on the streets, collapsed at home or protested after 12-14 hours of gruelling duty under the scorching sun. Despite the rising numbers, Delhi Police say they have a plan to contain the virus spread. This includes reserving beds for police personnel in 10 hospitals and setting up isolation centres for asymptomatic personnel, who are advised to be in home quarantine, but many of whom do not have enough space at home to self-quarantine themselves. A testing centre dedicate for police personnel is operational at Shalimar Bagh with a capacity of testing 50 samples per day. Around 1,500 personnel have already been tested here, said a third police officer privy to the information on condition of anonymity. Six police vehicles have been designated for ferrying personnel to quarantine centres or hospitals from their homes, following all protocols such as wearing PPE kits.“As soon as any symptoms are reported by any personnel, the person is quarantined in a suitable facility - may it be hospital, quarantine centre or home quarantine. The person’s testing is done and based on the outcome contact tracing is done without a delay. The contacts are also isolated and subject to all preventive measures,” said Aggarwal.Joint commissioner of police (southern range) Devesh Chandra Srivastava said that a circular was issued last month that detailed how to work amid the pandemic and avoid coming in physical contact of colleagues and the public. “Focus has been given on the use of technologies to avoid physical contacts. Most of the meetings are now being done through video conferencing,” added Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fourth-delhi-cop-succumbs-to-covid-689-positive-so-far/story-Q9ii68hLqS7vRClICEHbCJ.html
10-06-2020||India||Villages in Goa take to self-imposed Covid lockdowns||PANAJI : As the number of coronavirus cases rise in Goa, villagers in the state have been voluntarily locking themselves up at home and ensuring a complete shutdown of normal activity to ride out the coronavirus pandemic.It began on June 6, when a health worker from Guleli in Sattari, a village located deep in the Western Ghats that line Goa’s eastern fringe with Karnataka, tested positive for the virus. People of the village quickly shut down the few shops in the village and quarantined themselves within their homes. The worker was posted on duty in the port town of Vasco da Gama which has since become a hotspot for the virus.Faster than the disease, the practice soon spread to neighbouring villages like Morlem after cases were found there too and culminated in Keri, a village that lies along the border with Karnataka, self-declaring a four-day shutdown to “break the chain” of the virus. On Tuesday, another village Usgao in the same taluka declared a two-day shutdown.“Yesterday the Keri youth and villagers got together and decided that since the coronavirus has reached close to home. The youth have come forward and called the each panchayat member and explained the plan. This is for our own good and is our own decision,” Laxman Gauns, a panchayat member from the Keri village, said.“We have to break the chain of the virus. So we will remain shut for four days. This is not a government directive or anything, but it is our own choice and decision. Those who work outside the village, they should take their own precautions. We cannot take the law into our own hands and they should make their own choice,” he said.“It’s not as if the virus will disappear within four days but we want to do what we can and also spread awareness,” he added.Cases emerge in rural Goa after health workers -- mainly those associated with the Vasco Urban Health Centre began testing positive. To date 15 health workers have tested positive and five family members related to the health workers also tested positive. Seven hail from the Morlem village neighbouring Keri and one from Guleli.A large number of persons from the villages of Sattari taluka are employed in the health department owing to the ‘benevolence’ of health minister Vishwajit Rane who favours jobs to people from the constituency he represents.Rane asked people to remain calm and promised to ramp up testing. “I have instructed the health officials to conduct tests in these areas to reduce the risk of community spread. I appeal to the people to remain calm as we are closely monitoring the situation in Sattari and Usgao,” he said.Aware of the fear that was building in the state, the Goa government deployed the director of health to brief the media and assure the state that Covid19 is “just like any other respiratory disease.”“There is a lot of fear that has spread and people are scared and they are scaring others too. It is just like any other respiratory disease and if we can take precautions, there will be nothing to worry. Also, as per our numbers, only 5% of patients show symptoms the rest 95% are asymptomatic. We also have a zero mortality rate and a 100% cure rate,” Dr José de Sa, director of health services, said.“There are other communicable diseases in the community, we don’t have to fear. But have to take all precautions and for high risk persons those who are above 65, children less than five and those who have comorbid condition and pregnant women, have to be extra careful. Wear a mask hand washing and routinely follow all precautions,” he said.Propagating the fear were legislators who insisted that the Vasco town in Goa was a fit case for a complete lockdown. While the government has refused to impose a lockdown on the town, traders and sellers voluntarily decided to shut shop citing their own safety. On Tuesday, Goa reported 29 new cases, taking the total to 359, of which 292 cases are active.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villages-in-goa-take-to-self-imposed-covid-lockdowns/story-kveGMZhZqsZRqKTPiWGb2J.html
10-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||On Sunday, the world saw around 136,000 new cases of the coronavirus disease — the most in a single day. On Monday, the World Health Organization’s director general Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said this in a media briefing. WHO also warned that the pandemic appears to be accelerating.The number may not be accurate — although it has been widely reported by many respected media outlets without qualification — but the trend is. The New York Times’ database shows 114,990 new cases on Sunday, June 7. The Johns Hopkins database shows around 119,100 cases on Sunday and worldometers.info 113,417.Perhaps, everyone else has it wrong. Or maybe, this is another thing that WHO — it once said masks weren’t required and that there was no clear evidence of human-to-human transmission of the coronavirus disease — has gotten wrong.But that wasn’t the strangest thing someone from WHO said on Monday. The organization’s technical lead for Covid-19, Dr Maria Van Kerkhove, said in a briefing that: “It still appears to be rare that an asymptomatic individual actually transmits onward.” Experts reacted cautiously. Some said that, if true, it was a momentous discovery. Others said they’d like WHO to provide more details.It’s been widely accepted so far that asymptomatic individuals — around a third of the infected population, according to some experts; and around a fourth of the infected population in India, according to a study of around 40,000 cases by the Indian Council of Medical Research — pose a big transmission risk. One expert, Dr Ashish Jha, the director of Harvard’s Global Health Institute, took to Twitter and reasoned that perhaps “WHO is drawing a distinction between asymptomatic spread and pre-symptomatic spread” and that “maybe there isn’t a lot of asymptomatic spread but plenty of pre-symptomatic spread”. But he added that “such a statement by WHO should be accompanied by data” and that “WHO should be clearer in communication” (see page 11).WHO partially walked back the comment on Tuesday, but stopped short of a complete retraction (which would have been preferable). As for the trend that WHO did get right, the pandemic does not appear to be slowing down even as the number of cases has exceeded 7 million and the number of deaths 400,000. There are new hot spots that are driving up the number of cases; India, Russia, and Brazil are all hot spots and Latin America would appear to be the next epicentre of the pandemic which, even as it wanes in one geography, starts growing in another (see page 11).Countries and cities affected early by Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, are now opening up. Europe appears to be fine; according to a report in the Wall Street Journal that cited the European Centre for Disease Control, infections in early June are 80% lower than the peak seen in early April. Even New York City started opening up earlier this week. Experts say that while the virus seems to have run its course in these countries and cities, scattered flare-ups of infections cannot be ruled out. Many countries have seen these, but barring Singapore and, now, Iran, most have avoided a full-fledged second wave of infections — at least for now.While on the subject of waves, research by the Harvard Medical School, based on satellite images of hospital parking lots in Wuhan and search engine queries for “cough” and “diarrhoea” (both symptoms of Covid-19) suggest that China’s first wave may have started as early as August 2019, Reuters reported on Tuesday. China dismissed the claim as “ridiculous” but it is still not clear how the virus mysteriously emerged in Wuhan in December (see page 11).That is an important piece of the puzzle.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-o2tQyy0LFSBrsyPsobhN8H.html
10-06-2020||India||Our economy is tourism dependent... I don’t expect many visitors this year: Uttarakhand CM||The first of the major relaxations as part of India’s three-phase ‘unlocking’ plan following Covid-19 lockdown came into force on Monday. Uttarakhand chief minister Trivendra Singh Rawat spoke to Chetan Chauhan and Neeraj Santoshi about the plan, the pandemic, return of migrants, and revival of the economy. Edited excerpts: What steps have you taken to check the Covid-19 spread?Uttarakhand reported its first case on March 15 when an IFS [Indian Forest Service] trainee officer returned from Spain and tested positive. We Immediately announced school holidays and issued an order regarding work from home in case of government employees. Even before the [national] lockdown was announced from March 25, we had imposed lockdown here on March 23. We identified all the jamaatis [who attended a congregation in Delhi that led to a spike in Covid-19 cases in March] and their contacts, numbering over 1,400, and sent them for quarantine and treatment. We intensified our vigil on borders and started sanitisation drives on Saturdays and Sundays.How are you dealing with the return of migrants, who may have been infected?By May 15, we were moving towards freeing the state from Covid, but then the cases again spiked with the return of the migrants. We expected that cases will spike with migrants returning from Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi. But it was important to bring these people back, as the industries and the service sectors they were working in had shut down. In the last two days, comparatively, the Covid-19 cases have come down. Watch | Covid War Room: Uttarakhand CM’s medical & economic plan as India ‘unlocks’What are your plans for the migrants who have returned? As per our survey, the people, who had returned, wanted to return. Now, most of the returnees do not want to go back. We have launched an online portal HOPE through which skilled people of Uttarakhand working or living in any part of the country can upload details regarding their expertise based on which authorities and employers here can take a decision on where and how they can be employed in the state. I have been told that around 6,000 people have uploaded their details.How does the state plan to revive its economy as the country unlocks?Except in Dehradun, we have opened all religious places, hotels, and restaurants. We allowed industries to start operating even before the unlock began. Farming had not stopped. We have started focussing more on agriculture and the allied sectors. The demand for Himalayan products will increase, be it the immunity-boosting herbs, vegetables, fruits, honey, or ayurvedic products.How long will it take to revive the economy?...we have incurred a loss of over Rs 8,000 crore. Our economy is primarily dependent on tourism. And the way the situation is emerging, despite unlock, people are still apprehensive. Our main tourism season is from April to June. During monsoons and after, tourists hardly come here. I do not see many tourists coming here this year.Does Uttarakhand have any plans to promote Ayurvedic and Himalayan products?The demand for herbs and medicinal plants has soared. Take the example of herb Giloy, which was available earlier for Rs 10 per kg. Now, it is available at Rs 50. Likewise, the demand for fruits and vegetables has increased. Products like honey and golden trout, most of which are unseasonal, are in great demand. We have especially focussed on herbs. Under Mukhyamantri Swarojgar Yojana, we have identified 150 employment avenues. People who opt for this scheme will get subsidised loans to start their own ventures for producing Himalayan products. We are focussing on hilly areas, where we have started rural growth centres, where local people will be facilitated to start their own ventures using local resources without harming the environment. So overall, we will be focussing on branding, grading and value addition of our Himalayan products. We are also developing a cluster approach for developing and promoting local Himalayan products. So far, we have identified 10,000 clusters in the state related to agriculture, horticulture, aromatic plants, fisheries, medicinal plants.What are apprehensions related to tourism and pilgrimage to Char Dham?We have opened all religious places except for Char Dham and the ones in Dehradun as the priests are apprehensive. I have told officials and public representatives to talk to them. We want to start Char Dham yatra in a limited way... People are apprehensive about tourists and we need to tell people that they need to learn to live with the virus. We are working on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/our-economy-is-tourism-dependent-i-don-t-expect-many-visitors-this-year-u-khand-cm/story-kGKkbU2JldHc4dHwR95zTJ.html
10-06-2020||India||India, unlocking, is among 15 high-risk nations: Study||India is among a group of 15 high-risk countries where relaxing lockdowns could lead to a spike in new infections, creating a situation which, “in the extreme case”, could lead to stringent curbs being re-imposed, an analysis by securities research firm Nomura has said.The analysis, which covers 45 major economies, takes into account case trajectories and mobility trends to determine the impact movement of people will have on new cases. “Our visual tool has yielded a mixed bag of results: 17 countries are on track with respect to reopening economies with no sign of second wave; 13 countries showing some tentative warning signs; and 15 countries in danger zone of being most at risk of a second wave” the report said.According to the analysis, lifting lockdowns will lead to either of two potential scenarios. “In the first (good) scenario, a country or US state experiences a quick recovery in people mobility. Lockdown measures become relaxed, and businesses resume operations with minimal increases in the number of new daily cases, resulting in an ease in public fear and further increase in people mobility. As the number of new cases declines, a positive feed-back loops kicks in,” the analysis said.“On the other hand, the second (bad) scenario is characterised by a much ‘flatter’ curve. The reopening of the economy is associated with an acceleration in the number of new daily infections, growing public fear and ceasing people mobility; in extreme cases, lockdowns would be reimposed,” it added.The analysis divides the 45 countries into three groups: those ‘on track’, facing ‘warning signs’, or are in the ‘danger zone’. India falls in the danger zone, along with several other low-to-middle income countries such as Indonesia, Chile and Pakistan. Some of the advanced economies in this group are Sweden, Singapore, South Africa and Canada.Among those on track are France, Italy and South Korea, while countries like Germany, United States and United Kingdom face risks. The projections come at a time when most of these nations are easing restrictions in order to allow people to get back to work following what has been an unprecedented erosion of earnings and employment in many regions. The World Health Organization urged countries to press on with efforts to contain the virus and that now “is not the time for any country to take its foot off the pedal”. In India, malls, restaurants and religious places opened on Monday for the first time since March 25 as most parts of the country rolled out new guidelines that are part of the government’s “unlocking” plan. Economists have expressed concerns that another lockdown of the nature seen before the unlock measures kicked in will not be feasible unless the government announces adequate interventions to protect jobs and earnings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-unlocking-is-among-15-high-risk-nations-study/story-qv9MXw9Sv5ccLlVD9pe1VK.html
10-06-2020||India||Maharashtra crosses 90,000 Covid-19 case mark||Maharashtra crossed the 90,000 mark of Covid-19 cases with 2,259 new infections reported on Tuesday even as authorities in Mumbai expressed concern about the spread of the virus in the western suburbs of the coastal city.The case tally in the state stood at 90,787. Tuesday was ninth day when the state recorded more than 100 deaths in one day. Mumbai recorded 58 deaths, taking its toll of fatalities to 1,638. The city logged 1,015 cases on Tuesday, taking its case tally to 51,110As part of ‘Mission Begin Again’ to unlock restrictions in phases, the state government has allowed private offices in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) to operate at 10% of its workforce or 10 employees (whichever is higher) from Monday.This relaxation, along with the resumption of Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) bus services, saw more people and traffic snarls on roads in the city. Last week, the state also allowed physical activities such as jogging, running and non-essential shops to operate on alternate days in red zones (excluding containment areas).“We are closely monitoring the situation as cases may surge following maximum relaxations in lockdown given so far even in red zones. We are more worried of second wave that has hit countries like China and South Korea following relaxations. It will spark panic among people and the state may have to reconsider its decision on giving relaxations,” said a senior minister, wishing not to be named.The current situation of Covid-19 was discussed in the state cabinet meeting held on Tuesday evening. ‘We are also expecting curve to flatten by this month end if things remained under our control. After this, decline in cases will start,” added the minister.But there was a new cause for concern in Mumbai.While the average growth rate of Covid-19 cases in the city dipped to 2.93 per cent, three wards in the western suburbs covering areas like Malad, Kandivali, Borivali and Dahisar presented a problem for the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). While the rate of growth of the disease across the city was between one and four per cent, the rate in wards PN (Malad), RS (Kandivali, RN (Dahisar, Borivali) stood above five per cent.According to the BMC’s data, three wards -- covering Malad, Kandivali, Dahisar and parts of Borivali -- have over 4,000 Covid-19 cases.According to BMC officials, the growth rate in these three wards is high given that cases are now being reported from pockets in the city that had no cases initially. A BMC official said, “The recovering rate of the three wards including PN, RN and RS is also between 25 to 33 per cent which indicates that the cases have increased in the past few days.”Sanjay Kurhade, assistant municipal commissioner of RS Ward that covers Kandivali, said, “It is a universal strategy for tracing more, quarantining and testing more focused suspects, and due to this there is no separate strategy as such, but the growth rate is high also because we are having pockets where there were no cases earlier, but we are having cases now. Hence, our focus on such areas.”Kurhade added, “Slums are having a major chunk of focus when it comes to tracing and quarantining maximum people. There were few slum pockets where the downfall has started and things are under control there, but new pockets are emerging that are in a way contributing to the increased growth rate. Our focus currently is on areas like Poisar and Hanuman Nagar where cases have started reporting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-crosses-90-000-covid-case-mark/story-yqChR6CfmAuBSw4PTDZKvI.html
10-06-2020||India||Monsoon session could see online participation by MPs||The monsoon session of Parliament could see some members of Parliament in the house and others online -- a sort of hybrid seating -- so as to ensure that legislative business goes on without compromising on social distancing, officials of both houses involved in planning the session said on condition of anonymity. The last day Parliament sat was on March 24; the national lockdown , aimed at slowing the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, was imposed on March 25. The last phase of the lockdown ended on May 31; India is now in what the government calls Unlock 1.0, with more activities and air and rail travel resuming. The monsoon session typically starts in the first week of July. The plan being considered involves physical attendance of only those members whose participation in items of business is required on a particular day. Members of Parliament who have given notices to mention issues, have questions scheduled against their names, or have been nominated by the party to participate in debates will get preference to sit in the House.Those, who have no scheduled business against their name will participate digitally.At this stage, this is just a plan under consideration and a final call on the monsoon session and how it should be conducted will be taken by the union government, one of the officials said. The idea of a hybrid sitting of Parliament came up during a virtual meeting attended by Rajya Sabha chairman Venkaiah Naidu , Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla, and senior officials of both Houses on Tuesday. While reviewing options for the monsoon session, the officials pointed out that if the Indian Parliament has to maintain the prescribed social distancing norms, even the Central Hall of Parliament or Vigyan Bhavan’s plenary hall can’t accommodate all Lok Sabha members at a time.Given that, “an option discussed was to enable attendance in the Chambers of both the Houses of only those many members who can be accommodated as per the social distancing norm by drawing up lists of such members whose participation in various items of business is required on a daily basis,” said a second official official. “Officials were asked to examine in detail various issues related to enabling virtual participation of members in the proceedings of both the Houses including the maximum capacity available for enabling such virtual participation and the feasibility,” this person added. The original plan was to shift the Rajya Sabha to the Lok Sabha and hold the session of the Lower House in the more spacious Central Hall or even in Vigyan Bhavan.But if the members were to adhere strictly to social distancing norms, the Central Hall can accommodate not more than 200 people while the Rajya Sabha can accommodate about 60 MPs. They further said that “even if the Members were to be accommodated in the galleries (the chamber has galleries for public, diplomats and press), the total seating capacity would be much less than the required, if all members were to be accommodated.”Meanwhile, the plan to take the session entirely online has hit a technical hurdle. The NIC, government’s IT arm, has informed that it can only accommodate 600 participants for any virtual conference.A senior official of the Lok Sabha pointed out that it would be extremely difficult to request some MPs to go online in the hybrid plan, as almost all MPs would prefer to come to the House. “If the government brings any contentious bill, or if there is a discussion on issues such as Covid management of Indian economy, do you think the Opposition MPs would watch the proceeding online? If there is a voting on any bill, how will MPs participate?”Two former officials of Indian Parliament said that the government should wait for the Covid curve to flatten and only then think of holding a session.One of them pointed out that the Indian Constitution allows a six-month gap between the last day of the previous session and the first day of the next parliament. “The government has enough time till September to hold the monsoon session,” added this person who asked not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-session-could-see-online-participation-by-mps/story-Kr9f4LpqSzCFDkstW33HTM.html
10-06-2020||India||Surpassed Punjab in procurement of wheat, says Madhya Pradesh||Madhya Pradesh claimed to have surpassed Punjab in wheat procurement this rabi harvest season, to become the top state to procure the grain. The government said in an official communiqué that it had procured over 12 million metric tonnes of wheat by June 8.“Madhya Pradesh has reached the first position in the country in procurement of wheat on support price. Punjab ranks second in the country. Thus, 33% of the total wheat procured by all the states of the country has been procured in Madhya Pradesh,” the statement said. “As much as 38,654,000 metric tonnes of wheat have been procured throughout the country. Wheat procurement in Madhya Pradesh has increased by 74% as compared to that of the last year. Last year 73.69 lakh metric tonnes wheat was procured in Madhya Pradesh on support price.”Principal secretary, Food and Civil Supply Shivshekhar Shukla said, “Chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan gave top priority to the management of wheat procurement. In 75 consecutive meetings conducted by the CM from March 23, wheat procurement was reviewed daily. Leaving behind the hurdles of Corona lockdown and Nisarga cyclone impact the procurement team, Corona warriors and farmers of Madhya Pradesh made concerted efforts in this gigantic task.”The principal secretary said the government formulated an effective strategy for wheat procurement. All arrangements were made while procurement started late on April 15 due to Corona situation. Government made arrangements for additional gunny bags and storage immediately.“The biggest challenge was to ensure more procurement in a short time from more farmers. For this, the number of procurement centres was increased from 3545 last year to 4529 centres this year. While adhering to social distancing, the system of sending SMS to farmers was ensured so that only those who received the SMS reached the procurement centre. For the first time, in view of the challenge of completing procurement at the appropriate time, the facility to determine the SMS number at each centre was given to the collectors. At least 75 lakh SMSes were sent to farmers to ensure their awareness about Corona and other related information”, said the principal secretary.On Food Corporation of India (FCI) portal not showing the figures as being claimed by the state government the principal secretary said, “The FCI data on its web portal shows Punjab ahead but its data is yet to be updated. Wheat procurement process in Punjab came to an end on May 31 for this year, hence there is no chance of any further increase in Punjab procurement figure whereas in Madhya Pradesh procurement will go on up to June 15.”The FCI data shows that the government will have enough wheat to maintain steady food stocks to enable that the government is able to run different food schemes including Public Distribution System (PDS) during Covid pandemic, in which the government has increased supply of subsidised food grains to the poor and needy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/surpassed-punjab-in-procurement-of-wheat-says-mp/story-Fojb3BPjUA70LoDRNNm2MJ.html

Thambi was found dead in his Thiruvananthapuram house on Monday. His body was two-days old and was found in a decomposed state. He was staying with his son, who later told police that he was not aware of his death. In post-mortem, it was found that Thambi died of a serious head injury and police also found some traces of a struggle in the report. Police suspect that the injury was allegedly inflicted by his son who is said to be an alcoholic. Though odour emanated from the two-day old decomposing body, his son who was found in the house in a drunken stupor, told police that he had no idea how his father died. The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Police have started questioning his son Aswin Thampy. Jayamohan’s wife had predeceased him.

10-06-2020||India||Ministries sanitise as employees test Covid-19 positive||With the number of cases of the coronavirus disease in Delhi continuing to rise, the corridors of government haven’t been spared, causing some consternation among officials.For instance, on Monday, officials at the law ministry reached Shastri Bhawan, where their office ids located, only to encounter a circular that said three more of their colleagues had tested positive for Covid-19. That added to three other cases, including that of a joint secretary, that had already been reported.“There was concern among a lot of us. It seems even in these top offices, the attempt to control the pandemic are not proving very successful. So of their own initiative around twenty law ministry employees went and got themselves tested in a Delhi hospital. Their results are yet to come,” said an official who asked not to be named. HT couldn’t confirm this and it isn’t immediately clear how they got around guidelines and infrastructural bottlenecks that make testing in the capital a testing exercise.Still, the law ministry is better off than the labour ministry in the neighboring Shram Shakti Bhawan in Lutyens’ Delhi.An official memorandum released by the labour ministry on Monday carried a long list of employees of the ministry who had tested positive: 22 in all. “It is like a case of community spread within the ministry,” said the official cited above.Several other ministries in the venerable Shastri Bhawan and government departments have had their corridors sealed and offices sanitized with employees, and their drivers or relatives testing positive.There have been many such cases of indirect contact -- the driver of a joint secretary in the culture ministry or the daughter of an employee in the social justice ministryThe coal ministry saw the death of a section officer due to Covid on May 27.On Sunday, a key official responsible for the government’s communication outreach, Principal Director General of the Press Information Bureau (PIB) K S Dhatwalia tested positve and was admitted to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Ministries are trying to take steps to control the spread of the pandemic by calling fewer employees, ensuring social distancing, and regular sanitization.The department of administrative reforms and public grievances issued a circular detailing the steps that need to be taken. The circular took note of the rising number of cases among government servants and also the instances of deaths.It suggested washing hands every half an hour, disinfecting electrical switches, door knobs, elevator buttons, wearing face masks and not calling anyone even with mild cough to office. Other ministries too are trying to take precautions yet the last few days have been quite testing.“The situation is not pleasant at all. However, there is the compulsion to carry on the work. We have to take it in our stride, it is now like an occupational hazard. Often bureaucrats as they make policies are accused of not knowing ground realities. Now with so many cases in our buildings, at least, we can’t be accused of not knowing the situation on the ground,” said another official who spoke on condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministries-sanitise-as-employees-test-ve/story-UIttkKGmPmNQ4g9v0cAkXN.html
10-06-2020||India||As migrant workers return, state govts gear up to control Covid-19 spread||West Bengal has reported the fastest increase in the Covid-19 cases since June 1 followed by Jharkhand, Odisha and Bihar, according to the data from the state health departments. These states have received the maximum number of migrant workers left jobless by the Covid-19 lockdown in industrial states like Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana and Karnataka.The Centre on May 30 released details of the first of a three-phase plan - Unlock 1.0 - to lift stringent restrictions imposed over two months ago to stop the spread of the Covid-19 and allowed unrestricted interstate movement from June 1. According to an affidavit submitted in the Supreme Court, around 10 million migrant workers had returned to the states like Bihar, Odisha and Jharkhand on special Shramik trains till the first week of June from May 1, when the special railway services were started.The return of the migrant workers has been cited among the reasons for the spike in the Covid cases in these states even though they are still lesser than those in Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat. As the lockdown restrictions have been eased since June 1, the increase in Covid cases is much higher in the states that received a large number of migrant workers than Maharashtra, Gujarat and Rajasthan.In the first eight days of June, West Bengal recorded about 3,300 new cases as compared to 1,042 in the last eight days of May. The cases in Jharkhand increased from 360 to 610 in the last eight days of May. In the first eight days of June, the cases went up to 1,290 there. Similarly, Covid cases in Odisha increased to 2,994 from 1,948 on May 31. The number was 1,335 on May 24. The pace of increase in cases in Bihar, Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh from June 1 to June 8 (between 8 to 6%) was not as high as in West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha but was higher than the western states.“The cases have increased because of the migrant workers, who account for 72% of the total cases. In fact, their contribution has increased from about 66% in last week of May to 72% now,” said Bihar’s health secretary Lokesh Kumar Singh. He added two million migrants have arrived in the state on 1,491 Shramik Special trains between May 3 and June 5.A Madhya Pradesh health department official, who did not want to be named, said, “Though the recovery rate has gone up to more than 65%, there is no reduction in the number of positive cases being reported daily....” He added that this was even as major cities like Bhopal, Indore and Jabalpur are still under lockdown.Jharkhand health secretary Nitin Kulkarni said a large number of untested samples had piled up (over 13,000 as on June 1). “Their results started coming in the first week of June, a reason for the increase in the cases.”Dr DK Singh, director of government-run Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences, Ranchi, said, “Only a target group [in the quarantine centres] are being tested. Samples are not coming from the community as a whole. So it is difficult to assess the actual effect of unlock-1 when movements within the cities, towns and villages started.”Odisha government officials said over the last 15 days, 80% of 1,557 cases have been detected in quarantine centres housing migrant workers. “What is worrying is that new cases have emerged from rural areas of Odisha,” said a health official on condition of anonymity.In Bengal, ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) blamed the Centre for the spike from 3,816 cases on May 25 to 8,613 on June 8. “I would like to ask the Union government, who runs the Indian Railways? Who packed the migrant workers in the trains like cattle?” TMC spokesman Derek O’Brien said. Bharatiya Janata Party state unit chief, Dalip Ghosh, accused the state government of mismanagement and fudging data to hide the real picture. “The situation is really bad due to the failure of the TMC government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-workers-return-state-govts-gear-up-to-control-spread/story-sof1MtaZSLp3h3EkhNtLEI.html

The teams will review the situation, and look into ways that can be adopted for better containment and clinical management of cases. They will be in direct contact with the respective state governments on ground to chalk-out areas-specific plans,” said a health ministry official.The three-member teams consist of two public health experts—an epidemiologist and a clinician— and a senior joint secretary level nodal officer for handholding states on administrative matters related to Covid-19 management and also technical support for assisting in containment measures.“Whatever bottlenecks are faced on ground in terms of getting approvals to follow certain protocols or specific measures needed to manage the situation it will be quickly addressed,” said the official, who requested anonymityThe health ministry in a statement also said, “These teams are working in the field and visiting health care facilities to support the State health department in implementation of containment measures and efficient treatment/clinical management of cases within the districts/cities.”“In order to ensure better coordination, quick action on the ground, adoption of a more granular strategy, it is proposed that these districts/municipalities should regularly remain in touch with central teams which are already coordinating with the States. Such frequent interaction would further strengthen the surveillance, containment, testing and treatment related action on the ground,” the statement said.The focus areas of the teams are to address gaps mainly in testing, especially low tests that are performed on per million population, high confirmation rates, risk of capacity shortfall over the next two months and potential bed shortage, apart from looking at the growing case fatality rate, high doubling rate, sudden spike in active cases, etc.Many districts and municipalities have already constituted a dedicated core team at the district level consisting of district level medical and administrative officials to coordinate over regular basis directly with the central team for better flow of information.Experts say area-specific strategies should have been started early on when there was noticed a surge in cases.“That is how epidemics are contained by going back to the drawing board and devising strategies that are specific to a particular geographical area. What works in one state may not work in another, so the plan has to created accordingly. And there should be no communication loss between the centre and the states when dealing with an outbreak situation,” says Dr Jacob John, former head of virology, Christian Medical College, Vellore. As the lockdown is being lifted, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan urged everyone to download the Aarogya Setu app to help in self risk assessment and in protection against the disease while chairing the 16th meeting of the high-level group of ministers (GoM) on Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Tuesday.At least 1.25 billion people in the country have already downloaded the app so far, and according to the experts the app will be most effective when maximum number of people download it. “It can be an effective surveillance tool but how effective the app is will depend on how many people have downloaded it,” said a senior health ministry official.The health minister also said that there was no space for complacency as curbs were being eased.“…as we enter into the Unlock1.0 phase where restrictions have been eased and curbs have been lifted, we need to be more disciplined in our COVID appropriate behaviour to ensure that all follow norms of physical distancing, make use of masks and face covers in all public places, adhere to norms of hand hygiene and follow protocols of respiratory etiquette. There is no space for complacency,” said Harsh Vardhan, in a statement.The meeting was attended by S Jaishankar, minister of external affairs, Hardeep Puri, Civil aviation minister, Nityananda Rai, minister of state for home affairs, Mansukh Lal Mandaviya, minister of state for shipping & chemical and fertilizers, Ashwini Kumar Choubey, minister of state for health and family welfare and Bipin Rawat, chief of defence staff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-deploys-teams-to-15-states-to-help-manage-crisis/story-IOZ4WzbADWdeCwV2e26BbJ.html
10-06-2020||India||India considering universal basic income, NHRC tells UN||India is considering a universal basic income and will not consider a repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers ) Act or a moratorium on the death penalty, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) has told the United Nations. In a first, NHRC, submitted a mid-term report to the United Nations on the human rights situation in the country , highlighting the government’s policies on climate change, rights of women, children, disabled, and the elderly, and the right to food, work and health. In the report, Universal Periodic Review (UPR)-III, the UN has been informed that the Indian government is examining and “actively considering” the possibility of a universal basic income to reduce poverty. Universal basic income (UBI) refers to periodic cash transfers to every citizen.The government has focused cash transfer schemes aimed at farmers, especially, but no universal cash transfer programme. As part of UPR-III, the Indian government accepted 152 recommendations out of 250 by 112 UN member states in September 2017 pertaining to poverty alleviation, rights of women, children, persons with disabilities, elderly, marginalized populations and right to education etc. However, it refused to accept 98 recommendations including repeal of the Armed Forces (Special Powers ) Act, a moratorium on the death penalty, violence against marginalized groups and concerns over the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA), a law regulating foreign funding to non-governmental organizations etc.UPR is an international peer review mechanism based on a periodic self-assessment by each country of its human rights record, achievements and challenges, which is supplemented by reports from UN human rights experts, entities, treaty bodies, national human rights institutions, and civil society organizations. India was one of the first countries to be reviewed under the UPR mechanism.In the mid-term report submitted last month, accessed by Hindustan Times, NHRC has listed passing of Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, which criminalizes instant Triple Talaq, as a key step in eliminating discrimination against women.It has also listed government flagship schemes such as the PM Awas Yojana affordable housing initiative , the Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Transformation, the Swachh Bharat Mission, and the Ujjwala scheme of free cooking gas connections for the poor.Civil society organizations, which are part of the Working Group of Human Rights (WGHR), say NHRC has done the bidding of the government of India rather than giving an independent view on the human rights conditions in India.Henri Tiphagne, executive director of the People’s Watch, said: “We are quite surprised because this NHRC UPR report reads like a government of India report. Many events have taken place (since India accepted the recommendations of UN member countries) but nothing has been mentioned in the report. The report doesn’t show the independent view of NHRC”.Sanjoy Hazarika, director of the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, welcomed NHRC submitting a mid-term report but added that the non-government organisation was meeting in couple of days to brainstorm on the findings. A 12-member Working Group of Human Rights (WGHR) for India, which includes CHRI, will prepare its own report and send it to the UN. NHRC chairperson, justice (retd) H L Dattu, said, “This (mid-term) report addresses all the recommendations given by the UN members for the central government during last review meeting (in September 2017 in Geneva). The UPR is significant because it takes into account issues pertaining to human rights including poverty, religious issues, women rights etc.”Asked about NHRC’s role in the whole process, Dattu said, “The Commission has the role of an onlooker as these recommendations are for the central government (to address).”Meenakshi Ganguly, South Asia Director at Human Rights Watch (HRW) said: “The NHRC, to meet standards set out under the Paris Principles, should act as an independent authority to ensure human rights protections, recommend reforms, call for accountability when there are violations. It should act as a constitutional body to provide independent checks and balances. The commission should also be speaking out about violations linked to a crackdown on freedom of speech and peaceful protest. It is not supposed to report government achievements. That is for the state party to do.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-considering-universal-basic-income-nhrc-tells-un/story-EiOBsxDkDtzhGIQlbb141N.html
10-06-2020||India||Railways likely to merge junior and mid-level jobs, say officials||Indian Railways is mulling merging several junior and mid-level posts as part of its plans to rationalize the organisation and making it leaner, following the Union cabinet’s nod for merging its eight major cadres into a central services Indian Railway Management Service, according to officials aware of the development. The rail ministry has drafted a proposal based on recommendations from all railway zones for merging key posts in the accounts, commercial, electrical, mechanical, engineering, medical, personnel, operating, stores, and signal & telecommunication departments, and also other miscellaneous posts. According to the proposal, all ticket checking, reservation and enquiry posts from the commercial department may be merged. Railway Protection Force constables may be deployed for checking tickets at stations. “ A single category may be defined with a particular training schedule,” the proposal said. According to a suggestion by two railways zones the category of guard and the Loco Pilot should be merged ; the zones also proposed a ticketing process akin to that in airlines. In the accounts department, the zones said, “preparation of salary and passing can be done by same department… Disbursement of salary should be streamlined along the lines of pension payments which are managed by banks and except supervisory staff of personnel and accounts department, all other categories should be extinguished.” Zones have also recommended outsourcing unskilled jobs including that of cleaners. The Union cabinet in December 2019 approved the restructuring -- trimming the Railway Board’s strength to half (from 8 to 4) and unifying its eight railways services into a central service in a bid to reform the 150-year-old Railway Board of the Indian Railways.The modalities and unification of the services will be worked out by the rail ministry in consultation with the Department of Personnel and Training. The process was scheduled to be completed within a year.The proposals will be finalised by an eight-member committee constituted last month by the railway board for looking into re-skilling of the staff. Separately, the Centre had also formed a group of secretaries headed by the cabinet secretary for implementing the exercise of restructuring the board; this committee includes the Chairman, Railway Board, the DOPT secretary and the secretary of the department of expenditure. This committee will assist the group of ministers constituted by the government for formalizing the restructured railway board. The GOM will be formed after the recommendations of the committee, officials said.Spokespersons for the ministry of railways did not respond to HT’s queries. “The plan is to streamline the organisation; 1.3 million employees is too manpower intensive and becomes under productive too hence it is broadly to reduce manpower,” a railway official said on condition of anonymity.The national carrier may also merge the medical cadre categories into four from the current seven. Two zones said that only laboratory staff, pharmacists and nursing staff should remain while all other categories should be outsourced. “ Broadly they have made up their mind to push through manpower rationalization. And since higher cadre merger has been done this won’t be much of a problem,” another railway official said, asking not to be named. The proposed organizational reforms were aimed at ending the division of the mammoth organisation into different departments. The Indian Railways employs nearly 1.3 million people and its trains carried 2.3 million passengers every day before the lockdown. The government has said the move was aimed at ending a legacy marked by inefficiency in work, infighting over control of assets and resources, and delays in decision-making.“I have always maintained that there should be two services instead of one. A single service will always create problems when you ask technical department to do non-technical work all their education and specialization in the field will go to waste,” said former railway board chairman Vivek Sahai.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-likely-to-merge-posts-across-depts/story-6dihbrFjSosaWSOgS0gTOM.html
10-06-2020||India||Two weeks after big blowout in Assam, gas well catches fire||A gas well at Baghjan in Assam’s Tinsukia district caught fire on Tuesday and triggered protests from the residents of the area even as chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal assured them of their safety and said he has spoken to Centre for all possible assistance. The well caught fire as experts were trying to control the blowout, or leakage of gas and condensate, from it since May 27. The blowout had prompted the evacuation of nearly 2,000 people living near the well to four relief camps. Plumes of smoke emanating from the well could be seen kilometers away from the site near the Dibru Saikhowa National Park and the eco-sensitive Maguri Mottapung wetland, which are home to endangered hoolock gibbons and Gangetic dolphins.The residents staged a protest close to the site and blamed Oil India Limited (OIL) for failing to control the blowout for two weeks. “We have been living in relief camps for two weeks now with the hope that the blowout would be controlled. But the fire has damaged several houses and hopes of any early solution. The night sky is lighted up by the fire and the air is filled with smoke,” said Madhab Moran, a resident of Baghjan.OIL has asked the state government to control the situation so that experts and officials can reach the site to control the fire and the blowout. Three experts from Singapore firm Alert Disaster Control arrived in Assam to plug the leak on Monday.“The fire broke out at 1:40 pm. The reason for the outbreak is not ascertained yet. Apart from a fireman of the Oil and Natural Gas Commission, who sustained a minor injury, no one else has been injured,” said OIL’s senior manager (corporate communications) Jayant Bormudoi. “The experts were not present at the site when the fire broke out. They were at meetings at an OIL office in Duliajan. There is no immediate threat to residents of the area, who have already been shifted beyond a radius of 1.5 km from the well.”An OIL statement said fire tenders have been pressed into service to control the fire. “The current situation would be brought under control by the experts,” it said.The statement said several options for plugging the blowout were discussed and it was decided to use the capping stack guide rail system, which will involve a large prefabricated device to seal off the well.Sonowal said instructions have been issued to district officials to ensure the safety of the residents. “Police, military, paramilitary forces, and NDRF [National Disaster Response Force] are present at the spot,” he said. “I have apprised Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan about the incident and asked him to take steps to contain the fire and the blowout. The Indian Air Force can also play a role in controlling the fire and I have asked defence minister Rajnath Singh about it.”Sonowal asked residents of the area and Tinsukia town, 9 km away, to not panic and assured all help from the government.The blowout on May 27 was reported while work was underway to produce gas from a new oil and gas bearing reservoir at a depth of 3729 metres. A blowout means an uncontrolled release of crude oil or gas from a well when pressure control systems fail.HT on June 3 reported the blowout was causing extensive damage to biodiversity and wildlife in the region.“Release of particulate matter and the fire will affect Dibru Saikhowa National Park. But the damage to Maguri Mottapung wetland will be immense. If this continues for another four weeks, humans will also not remain unaffected by the pollution. Despite a history of over 100 years of oil and gas exploration in the area, it is surprising we do not have the experts and equipment to deal with such an emergency,” said environmentalist Raj Phukan, who is a member of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-weeks-after-big-blowout-in-assam-gas-well-catches-fire/story-MkNRQVICwqz0fOPsj3gyrM.html
10-06-2020||India||India’s ties with Nepal set for deep freeze after Kathmandu’s decisive step on new map||Nepal’s lower house on Tuesday evening made a strong pitch in favour of the constitution amendment bill to redraw Nepal’s political map that could lead to a freeze in relations between Kathmandu and New Delhi.The new political map pushed hard by the KP Sharma Oli government is set to clear the first legislative hurdle in the lower house. The constitution amendment bill will next go to the 59-member National Assembly where the ruling Communist Party of Nepal has an overwhelming majority.The map, cleared by the Oli Cabinet last month, counts Indian territories of Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura as its own. Its passage by the cabinet on May 18 had angered India that asked Nepal to “refrain from such unjustified cartographic assertion” for an “artificial enlargement of territorial claims”.That message from New Delhi appeared to have gone unheard in Kathmandu.The new map was Prime Minister Oli’s effort to whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments at India’s cost and consolidate his weakening hold on the government and the ruling Communist Party of Nepal. It appeared to have bought PM Oli time.Also Read: The costs of anti-Indian nationalism in Nepal | HT EditorialOpposition parties that have been attacking the Oli government for his handling of the economy and Covid-19 found themselves coming around to back PM Oli in the lower house on Tuesday. PM Oli needs a two-third majority in both houses of Nepal’s Parliament.It was supported by political parties across the spectrum - 83 MPs spoke at Tuesday’s meeting - but the formal approval could take some time as the proposal for consideration of the bill “was adopted with lawmakers given 72 hours to file an amendment to the bill”. It would be passed once the chief whips of political parties agree that no amendment is required.There has been no formal response from New Delhi to Tuesday’s development. “There may be one later to set the record straight, a senior government official told Hindustan Times.Also Read: Decoding the India-Nepal dispute | OpinionNew Delhi is furious at Nepal’s political leaders creating a boundary dispute with India to serve their respective domestic political interests and is expected to cold shoulder requests for a dialogue.“Once Nepal cabinet and then parliament backed changes to its map to incorporate Indian territory, there isn’t a lot to talk about,” a senior government official said hours after Nepal’s foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali spoke of his country’s desire to talk to New Delhi to resolve the boundary issue.“We have expressed time and again that Nepal wants to sit at the table to resolve this problem,” Pradeep Gyawali had told news agency Associated Press on Tuesday.The foreign minister’s boss PM Oli had ignited the row after India reissued its map to incorporate changes in Jammu and Kashmir that had been carved into two union territories. Like in all previous maps, this one too continued to count Lipulekh, Kalapani and Limpiyadhura as part of the Indian state of Uttarakhand.Also Read: The past, present and future of the Nepal-India stand-off | AnalysisThe two countries planned to hold a round of discussions at the foreign secretary’s level to address Nepal’s concerns but the meetings couldt be scheduled for one reason or the other. PM Oli’s government, however, renewed the attacks after India inaugurated an 80-km road in Uttarakhand that almost goes up till Lipulekh Pass at the India-China border. This project essentially involved building a metalled road connecting Dharchula town in Uttarakhand to the Lipulekh pass.New Delhi was surprised when Kathmandu protested over the road that had been built in indian territory.This area, spread over 330 sq km near Nepal’s western tri-junction with India and China, had always been part of India in every map that had been issued for more than a century and in terms of the ground situation, a senior official said. This claim was also accepted by the Chinese when it inked a pact with India to trade via Lipulekh pass back in 1954. When the two sides mentioned LipuLekh as a bilateral trade route in a 2015 joint statement sixty years later, Nepal registered its protest.Behind the sharp rhetoric from Kathmandu over the road and Covid-19 in recent weeks, Indian officials said PM Oli appeared to be aiming to immortalize himself in Nepal’s history as the prime minister who stood up to its big neighbour. Quite like Prime Minister Kirtinidhi Bista who persuaded Indira Gandhi in 1969 to wind up Indian military posts along the Nepal frontier. When former foreign secretary Shyam Saran was India’s ambassador to Kathmandu, Bista told him that he counted his conversation with Gandhi as his life’s “greatest moment”.In recent years, Indian officials said Nepal politicians had found themselves unable to take a stand on India and found it politically expedient to lay the blame at India’s doors.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in contrast, had gone an extra mile to accommodate the himalayan nation.Like when the two countries were looking at a new pact to replace the 1950 Treaty of Peace and Friendship between the two countries, PM Modi had messaged early in his first stint as prime minister that Kathmandu could put together the first draft of the new treaty which the two sides could discuss.When Nepal had reservations over the 50:50 funding format proposed for the Pancheshwar dam project, PM Modi had again asked Nepal to contribute what it could and promised to pool in the rest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-s-ties-with-nepal-set-for-deep-freeze-after-kathmandu-s-decisive-step-on-new-map/story-MF1pWaJYEQrB0PMuFe9XmL.html
10-06-2020||India||India, China disengage at Ladakh standoff points, commanders to meet tomorrow||China is withdrawing soldiers deployed in the Galwan area of eastern Ladakh and thinning out troops in the Pangong Tso sector where it was locked in a standoff with Indian military for a month, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.Top government officials said the process of the Chinese side withdrawing troops had started yesterday. “We have also reciprocated and moved back our troops,” a top government official said on Tuesday evening.“The process to restore status quo ante has started at the standoff locations,” the official said. The next steps will be worked out at a meeting of Major General-level officers scheduled for tomorrow.Hindustan Times was the first to report on Monday that the activity at the standoff points had declined after discussions between military commanders of the two countries. Lt Gen Harinder Singh, commander of Leh-based 14 Corps, who had been in constant touch with national security planners in Delhi, had led the Indian delegation. The Chinese side was led by Maj Gen Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region.The standoff started after a May 5 clash after Chinese soldiers clashed in eastern Ladakh near Pangong Lake. This was the first major flare-up along the LAC since the 73-day standoff at Doklam in 2017. Chinese troops also moved in three more locations in the Galwan sector, setting up the standoff in three locations of the Galwan valley with additional troops and support elements.Also Read: India China standoff explained: Bridge over troubled watersThe standoff in the Galwan valley was at three points, marked as the Indian army’s patrolling points 14, 15 and 17. These locations are about 6 km east to the confluence of the Galwan rivulet and Shyok river.ALSO WATCH | Indian, Chinese troops disengage at standoff points in eastern Ladakh At patrolling point 14, Chinese soldiers had come to their claim of the Line of Actual Line and objected to India building a 60-metre-long strategic bridge being built to give troops easy access to Daulat Beg Oldie, the last military post south of the Karakoram Pass. “They have gone back from patrolling point 14,” a government official said.At patrolling point 15, Chinese soldiers had put up a large number of tents and had been camping there for the last one month. India had also matched their presence and had been camping at the same place. “Both sides have started reducing their tents at this point,” the official explained.At the third standoff point, marked on a map as Galwan sector’s patrolling point 17, both sides had mobilised a large number of troops and armoured carriers. The armoured carriers have been moved back; the soldiers will be next, an official said.“The de-escalation exercise has started near the Pangong lake standoff point also…. It will take some time to complete the process,” a senior army officer said.Chinese troops had come to Finger 4 - the name given to one of the 8 cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range that overlooks the lake - and brought along 124 vehicles and 14 boats. The boats have been moved back and the thinning out process has begun in this sector, a top government official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-troops-at-standoff-points-in-ladakh-s-galwan-valley-start-thinning-out-india-also-reciprocates/story-szMVWcXpP5Gn7zwIzgMMsN.html
10-06-2020||India||Maharashtra Dalit youth murdered for ‘stalking’ upper caste girl, six arrested||Maharashtra police have arrested six persons for murder of a 20-year-old youth Viraj Vilas Jagtap, who had fallen in love with a girl from upper caste, according to an FIR registered by deceased’s uncle Jitesh Vasant Jagtap, a resident of Jagtap nagar area of Pimple Saudagar in Pune. Police inspector Mohan Shinde said that four of the six accused-- Hemant Kailas Kate, Sagar Jagdish Kate and two minors--were tracked and arrested by a crime branch unit of Pimpri Chinchwad police. The other two arrested in the case are Kailas Murlidhar Kate and Jagdish Murlidhar Kate, said police.The Jagtaps are dalit, while the Kate family belongs to the upper caste Maratha community. According to the FIR, the accused hurled racial abuse at Viraj before bludgeoning him to death.The HT Guide to Coronavirus COVID-19Viraj was found lying at the spot in blood-soaked trousers. He had received injuries on his head and elsewhere on his body, says the complaint filed by his uncle. Jitesh Jagtap told police that Viraj was able to give an account of the assault before he died.According to the FIR, the six members of the Kate family had driven their mini tempo into Viraj’s two-wheeler and attacked him with rods and stones as he fell down. An injured Viraj reportedly told his uncle that he started running when the six charged at him before he fell down. Kailas and Jagdish Kate along with the two minors pinned him down while Sagar and Hemant assaulted him with metal rod and stones, it alleges. Jagdish Kate allegedly also hurled casteist remarks at him for daring to pursue his daughter and even spat on him, the complaint says.Viraj was later rushed to Aditya Birla hospital where he was declared dead on Monday morning.The accused have alleged that the deceased was stalking a girl from the Kate family despite being warned and a history of enmity between the two families.Assistant police inspector Ambrish Deshmukh of unit 4 crime branch that led the team that arrested four members of the Kate family threw light on the version of the accused. “They said they had warned him against standing outside their house and stalking the girl. On Sunday night, Sagar Kate’s tanker got punctured near their house. Sagar says Viraj arrived at the spot under the influence of alcohol and started abusing him. Their fight turned violent, which is when two other family members arrived in a tempo and dashed Viraj’s two-wheeler and joined the fight. This is the accused men’s version,” said Deshmukh.A case of murder, criminal conspiracy has been registered at Sangvi police station with sections of prevention of atrocities against scheduled caste and scheduled tribe act and Maharashtra Police Act also invoked. Police inspector Ajay Bhosale is investigating the case. “We are now looking at the call records to confirm details. The girl’s version of the story will also be recorded. What the accused say has no meaning at this point in the investigation,” said Bhosale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-dalit-youth-murdered-for-stalking-upper-caste-girl-six-arrested/story-Q2FRuKoXhReKyY0O9nUhRN.html
10-06-2020||Editorials||Assam OIL blowout, fire: The polluter must pay | HT Editorial||The Baghjan natural gas well of Oil India Limited (OIL) in Assam’s Tinsukia district, which was spewing gas and condensate, caught fire on Tuesday — 13 days after it had a blowout. The well is close to the Dibru Saikhowa National Park (DSNP) and adjacent to the Maturin wetlands, one of India’s finest (and also home to some rare avian species). The blowout has caused extensive damage to the biodiversity and wildlife; Tuesday’s fire could lead to further destruction. The twin mishaps show the pitfalls of allowing hazardous industries in ecologically sensitive areas. In May, OIL received clearance for further drilling in DSNP. This order must now be reviewed. It is also imperative to assess what system failure led to the accidents and the extent of the damage to the environment and livelihoods. Then comes the question of compensation: OIL could be held liable under the absolute liability principle. But, in India, the compensation and relief process is circuitous, as a report by the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, titled The Management of Environment Relief Fund, shows. The report assesses the effectiveness of the Fund, which accepts contribution from industries covered under the Public Liability Insurance Act, 1991, and the compensation awarded by the National Green Tribunal (NGT) to victims of environmental damage.The Fund is beset with three problems: Amounts awarded by NGT are not first being credited to it; an overwhelming proportion of compensation orders are in the Supreme Court; there is no tracking of the implementation of the compensation process either by NGT or the government. These flaws must be fixed; otherwise erring parties will have no fear of the legal process and the polluter pays principle, and affected parties will continue to bear the brunt of such accidents. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/assam-oil-blowout-fire-the-polluter-must-pay/story-NOWyGTJ9798FRCabxVxDQI.html
