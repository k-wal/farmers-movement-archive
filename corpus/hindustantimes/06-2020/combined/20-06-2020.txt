A mandatory five-day institutional quarantine for all new Covid-19 patients, as originally ordered, would have been unprecedented. Nowhere in the world do governments force every coronavirus patient into public isolation facilities. Even the Indian Council of Medical Research guidelines recommend home isolation for most cases, given that 80% of the patients are either asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic.It is important to understand the system in place now. Our experience of home isolation has been beneficial for our health and well-being. Our samples were collected on Tuesday and we tested positive for coronavirus on Wednesday. Fortunately, we had no severe symptoms and did not need hospitalisation. That same day we received a phone call from a government telemedicine service that offered medical advice. An ASHA worker visited our homes, confirmed we were mildly symptomatic patients and pasted a sticker next to our main doors, giving neighbours fair warning. From the second day onwards, our health and symptoms were being monitored daily through the Delhi government’s tele-monitoring service that also provided guidance on the isolation process. An emergency phone number was also given to us to be called if our symptoms were to escalate. An ambulance would take us to a hospital if we were to report any escalation in symptoms.In one go, on Friday, the Centre shut down the most smoothly functioning piece of the coronavirus puzzle that is home isolation. One of the lessons of governance the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) has learnt is — do not fix something that is not broken. The roll back of the order is good because it would have otherwise created new problems for the city and its government, dealing a deadly blow to containment efforts in Delhi. The thought of being dragged into a railway coach parked at the Anand Vihar station upon testing positive would have driven away people from voluntarily coming forward to test themselves. And if asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients refuse testing and carry on with their lives, they would have ended up infecting others.Compulsory quarantine would have also needed additional resources, diverting medical staff, ambulances, and personal protective equipment kits away from hospitals that are treating critical patients. An already stretched medical system would have been forced to look after thousands of patients who may have never needed medical attention. The cost of providing hygienic quarantine facilities, food, water and sanitation to thousands of patients would have proved debilitating to the cash-strapped state government. Delhi is expected to have hundreds of thousands of cases over the next few weeks. The state should focus its efforts and resources on treating the sick, not providing shelter and food to asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients. The data on Delhi’s home isolation programme shows why it is highly recommended around the world. Only 6% of all positive patients under home isolation have been required to be shifted to a hospital or quarantine facility during their home isolation period. Of more than 27,000 patients who have been under home isolation thus far, only 1,618 reported a deterioration in their symptoms and had to be shifted to hospitals. This is 6% of all home isolation patients. We are happy with the roll back of the order because better sense has prevailed. Otherwise, Delhiites would have paid a huge cost.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/covid-19-why-home-isolation-is-a-critical-pillar/story-FyWZlsgwKPIv58jyDSIwUP.html
20-06-2020||News||The diplomatic dance for the horseshoe table||India will serve a two-year term on the United Nations Security Council (UNSC) from January 2021. This will be the nation’s eighth time at UNSC. Other than the Permanent 5 (P-5), UNSC has 10 elected members, five from Asia and Africa, two each from Latin America and Western Europe & Others (WEOG) and one from East Europe. Five of these elected members retire every year. There are five regional groups at UNSC, representing Asia, Africa, Latin America and in a hark-back to the Cold War, Eastern Europe, apart from WEOG that includes the United States (US), Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Israel. Most regional groups, other than WEOG, usually endorse their candidates ahead of the election. This time, we were the candidate for the Asian seat and obtained 182 out of 193 votes in the UN General Assembly. From WEOG, Norway and Ireland knocked out Canada for the group’s two seats.While the election is hotly contested, the election process is fascinating. The ballot is a blank sheet. You are supposed to know who is running, and write in the name of the country of your choice on the ballot. Of course, you can vote for your own country.India last served on the UNSC during 2011-12. The team was led by ambassador Hardeep Singh Puri, now minister in the Narendra Modi government (full disclosure: He is also a cousin). I was his deputy. Then, too, we were the only candidate from Asia and obtained a record 187 votes from 192 members. We had previously been on UNSC in 1991-1992 and were seeking to return after a gap of 19 years and a bruising defeat at the hands of Japan in 1996. India’s effort was to marshal the maximum number of votes.The widely publicised story after the election was of the Pakistani ambassador, Abdullah Hussain Haroon, having shown around his ballot apparently marked in favour of India. There were others who took photos on their phones and showed them to us, signalling their support.We missed five votes. Obviously, some were political. But strange things also happen. One African country received a vote on the Asian slate. Unbelievable, but the Ambassador wrote his own country’s name on the ballot, thinking that he had signed his support for India. Then, too, Canada was bested in the WEOG by Portugal and a late-entrant Germany. A diplomat from a small country told me that while he was awaiting instruction on his two votes, he was sure one would be Germany; after all, his president rode in a Mercedes.Elected members head Security Council committees. The P-5 refer to these as “goodies”. For us, obtaining the Chair of the Counter Terrorism Committee (CTC) was important. Strangely, the British opposed this saying that we were invested in the matter. But, playing the diplomatic game in New York, Delhi and London, India prevailed. During India’s chairmanship, we established the concept of “zero tolerance” for terrorism. Counter-terrorism will rightly be a focus for India during our forthcoming term on UNSC.With multilateralism under pressure, particularly as a result of Covid-19, UNSC, too, has its challenge set. India’s term on UNSC will also coincide with India hosting Brics (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) and G-20 summits. India should use the opportunity to push its case on Security Council reform to open up the horseshoe table that seats the UNSC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/the-diplomatic-dance-for-the-horseshoe-table/story-jVuagBGq0BeBLkmcdOyYZL.html
20-06-2020||News||5 reasons why scrapping home isolation of asymptomatic Covid-19 patients in Delhi may not be a good idea||The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) has ordered a mandatory five-day institutional quarantine for all Covid-19 cases, including asymptomatic patients and those with mild signs of the infection. The move could strain the Capital’s health infrastructure, which is already stretched; result in a shortage of health care workers; militate against people getting tested; hamper the detection rate; and throw Delhi’s long-term plan out of gear at a time when infections continue to rise. We look at five principal reasons why it may not be a good idea:1) Overrun health care infrastructureAdding thousands of people in institutional quarantine – 10,490 people were in home quarantine as of Friday night – will require a sudden and steep ramping up of the Capital’s health care infrastructure, increasing the risk of the system being overwhelmed by those being admitted. According to the government’s June 19 bulletin, 5,078 of its 10,961 Covid-19 beds were vacant, and 5,036 beds were available (out of 6,318) in Covid care and health centres. A senior Delhi government official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that this availability of resources was mainly because of the success of the home quarantine scheme.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Experts feel that home isolation of asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic patients is a crucial strategy in the fight against the highly infectious disease. “Why unnecessarily burden the health infrastructure that anyway gets overwhelmed when there is surge in cases? Medical beds should be kept for serious patients needing specialised care, otherwise where will you keep your serious patients whose lives we have to save? Home can be the best isolation facility so long as all protocols are followed,” said T Jacob John, the former head of virology at CMC, Vellore.2) Spark a severe staff shortageIf all cases are to be admitted to institutional facilities in the Capital, the authorities will have to find additional doctors, nurses and health workers. HT reported on Wednesday that the plan to add 23,800 beds this month for Covid-19 patients will require roughly 2,000 doctors and 3,000 nursing staff – resources that it has not been able to secure so far. To add to the shortfall, several health care workers testing positive are going into quarantine on coming in direct contact with Covid-19 patients. The government will also find it difficult to draw doctors, nurses and staff from its smaller non-Covid-19 hospitals.The challenge to secure more people has been intensified by the fact that some health workers fear getting infected. “Most of our nurses put down their papers when we were asked to earmark beds for Covid-19. Several other demanded higher salaries, it is not possible to do so in this economy,” said a doctor at a private hospital, asking not to be named. In a statement, the Delhi government said: “Entire manpower of the Delhi government is already stretched. Now, large quarantine centres would need to be made to house thousands of asymptomatic people.”Also read: Delhi health minister Satyendra Jain administered plasma therapy, health condition stable3) People may stop getting testedThe move is also likely to discourage asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic people from undergoing tests. Some feel that moving to institutional quarantine amid a shortage of beds and support staff will mean that the facilities are not up to the mark; they fear this will prompt people to avoid getting tested. Atishi, a legislator from the Kalkaji constituency and a spokesperson of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) who tested positive for Covid-19 two days ago and is currently under home isolation, said it has emotional and psychological benefits. “There is a lot of comfort attached to home isolation compared to institutional quarantine because you have your own room and most importantly, your own washrooms... In home isolation, you have your family to look after you.” She added that if institutional quarantine is made mandatory, then fewer people will opt for testing of Covid-19. “Police, along with medical staff, will come to pick even asymptomatic people up and take them to quarantine centres. People will be scared with all this and many will fear themselves from getting tested,” she said.4) Cases may go undetectedIf fewer people are willing to get tested, the undetected spread from such patients is likely to grow in the Capital. With the detection rate dipping, more people are likely to reach hospitals after their infection has advanced, which could possibly also impact the recovery rate. Experts also point to the risks of infections from crowded quarantine facilities.Home quarantine for patients has been approved by the Union government as an effective way to preserve health care infrastructure for future challenges, under certain guidelines. DDMA, however, said in its order on Friday that it fears “home isolation without physical contact to monitor the patients may be a reason for the increase in the spread of Covid-19 infections in Delhi”.Also read: Kejriwal opposes L-G’s 5-day mandatory institutional quarantine order, says ‘will lead to evasions’5) Long-term strategy takes a hitTo meet the need for around 150,000 beds by the end of July, the Delhi government has planned to use stadiums as makeshift hospitals. It has also identified neighbourhood facilities to meet the need for the beds, according to its prediction of the infection’s peak in the Capital. This strategy, however, was devised on the model which included mild cases being quarantined at home. With the latest guidelines, this plan stands compromised. A member of a committee created to look into the augmentation of Delhi’s health infrastructure previously told HT that the panel’s calculations, based on the Capital’s population and the current model, may have to be reworked and a new strategy may have to be devised. Experts insist that if the guidelines are changed on a regular basis, the projections and modelling of the scenarios will repeatedly need to be revised, creating a challenge for the long-term strategy. They also say that most countries in the world recommend home isolation for mild cases and the latest move by DDMA should be rethought.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/5-reasons-why-scrapping-home-isolation-of-asymptomatic-covid-19-patients-in-delhi-may-not-be-a-good-idea/story-1Myf8EXQysL4YdFQoWza2M.html
20-06-2020||News||Restricting Chinese imports will not be easy||The rising border tensions between India and China in the Galwan Valley took a bloody turn when 20 brave Indian soldiers lost their lives in a military skirmish with China. As strategic affairs experts try to figure out China’s Achilles heel which India can exploit to tame the dragon, the clamour for an economic boycott of China is growing.From an international law point of view, can India can impose restrictions on Chinese imports by, say, revoking China’s most favoured nation (MFN) status in the World Trade Organization (WTO)? In the immediate aftermath of the Pulwama terror attack, last year, in which around 40 Central Reserve Police Force soldiers died, India revoked Pakistan’s MFN status in the WTO. So arguably what is sauce for the goose should be sauce for the gander. Article XXI (b) (iii) of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) allows a WTO member country to take action “which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests taken in time of war or other emergency in international relations”. The current situation between India and China definitely qualifies as an emergency in international relations. Since this standoff also involves safeguarding India’s territorial sovereignty, there is an “essential security interest” at stake.The legal challenge for India, in order to make a successful case under Article XXI, will be to demonstrate that the trade-restrictive measure it adopts during this emergency with regard to China is “necessary” to address the current security situation. Contrary to what many believe, the words, “which it considers” in Article XXI (b) (iii) does not make the provision self-judging. Although India will enjoy significant leeway in determining what constitutes “necessary” measures, these shall be subject to a good faith review. There are two cases in which WTO panels dealing with the national security and defence have affirmed this. These are the Russia-Traffic in Transit case involving Russia and Ukraine and the recently decided case between Qatar and Saudi Arabia.Therefore, in order to show that the measure adopted is “necessary”, India has to prove two things. First, that India genuinely believes that adopting the measure (say reneging on an MFN obligation) is necessary to protect its essential security interests. Second, as the Russia-Transit case demonstrates, the measure meets the minimum requirement of plausibility with regard to the essential security interests in question. In other words, the measure should be connected to the emergency at hand as to make it feasible for the protection of essential security interests.In Pakistan’s case, India retracted its MFN promise by increasing tariff rates to 200% on all Pakistani imports. Although India’s decision to increase tariffs on Pakistani imports was driven by national security concerns, oddly enough, the notification on this did not even mention national security. This could have been because the decision was taken under Section 8A(1) of the Customs Tariff Act, which gives “emergency power” to the Indian government to increase import duties if the government is satisfied that this is necessary in the given circumstances. But, section 8A(1) does not talk of “national security” as a ground to modify tariff rates; it refers to economic emergencies.Consequently, it will be difficult to accept under WTO law that India genuinely believed that hiking tariff rates to 200% on all Pakistani imports is necessary to safeguard India’s essential security interests. India got away because Pakistan has not challenged India’s measure before a WTO panel. The reason could be that bilateral trade between the two countries is too small.But, using Section 8A(1) to impose trade restrictions on China will be tricky. China will, in all probability, challenge this in the WTO, and India will find it difficult to defend its action. If India wants to restrict Chinese imports on national security grounds, it will have to provide a reasonable explanation as to why and how imposing trade restrictions on China are “necessary” to defend India’s essential security interests.The other constraining factor for India is the high quantum of bilateral trade between the two countries. With bilateral trade at almost $90 billion a year, it is around 45 times more than that with Pakistan. Moreover, numerous Chinese imports are used as intermediary products in Indian industries ranging from pharmaceuticals, automobiles, and electronics. So, curbing imports on these will be tantamount to India losing out too. It is clear from this — when it comes to India’s dealing with Pakistan and China under WTO, what’s sauce for the goose is definitely not sauce for the gander.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/restricting-chinese-imports-will-not-be-easy/story-RcDRLpgszZtoDaC7AHmFIJ.html
20-06-2020||Delhi||School principal granted bail in Delhi riots case||A Delhi court on Saturday granted bail to Faisal Farooq, the principal of Rajdhani Public School, who was earlier charged with hatching a conspiracy to precipitate and aggravate riots in and around his school. The court observed that the CCTV camera footage did not show his presence at the place where the riots had broken out. Duty Judge Vinod Yadav said that one witness, Roop Singh, stated on March 8 that he had seen Farooq at the spot of the incident. Singh had also claimed to have heard him asking the guard of the school to permit Muslim persons inside the school.However, later in his statement recorded before the magistrate on March 11, he did not say a word about having seen the accused man at the scene or having heard him say anything to the guard of the school.The court, while granting bail, said that to “cover up” the deficiency in the statement of the witness, the Investigating Officer (IO) recorded a supplementary statement by Singh, claiming that he had got scared before the magistrate which is why he could not state the correct facts. The IO had moved an application before the court to get this additional fact added to his statement. However, it was dismissed by the judge, the court noted in its order.“It is clearly apparent that there are contradictions in the various statements of this witness about the applicant,” the court said. It also noted that Farooq kept on calling the police to report about damage to his school (Rajdhani Public School) from February 24, but the FIR in his case was not recorded then. It was ultimately recorded on March 5.“I have gone through the statements of PWs Roop Singh, Geeta, Manoj and Ashok Kumar and have also gone through the recorded statement of Prosecution Witness (PW) Roop Singh. Admittedly, the applicant is not seen in any of the CCTV camera footage.”The court also said that Geeta another witness, incidentally the wife of Roop Singh, also did not say a word about having seen the accused man at the spot on the date of the incident. It said that another witness Manoj, who was the guard at the Rajdhani school, has merely stated that Farooq had come to the school’s main gate and spoken to some persons outside the school.“From the aforesaid statements, it is prima facie not established that the applicant was present at the spot at the time of the incident. It is an admitted position that several CCTV cameras were lying installed at Rajdhani Public School at various places, the footages whereof have been thoroughly scrutinised by the Investigating Agency but the presence of the applicant therein is not there. If the applicant (Farooq) was not present at the scene of occurrence, then his involvement in the offences cannot be made out,” the judge stated in his order.The court also noted that “except a bald allegation,” there is no material to substantiate that Farooq had spoken to several people involved with the communal riots.“When the IO was confronted he stated that further investigation on the aspect of terror funding is underway...,” the court said.The court, while stating that the accused man had made a good case for bail, also noted, “It is made clear that nothing in this order shall be construed an expression on the merits of evidence to be adduced in the matter.”The police also chargesheeted 18 people in connection to the riots that broke out at the Rajdhani Public School, while naming its principal Faisal Farooq for hatching a conspiracy to precipitate and aggravate riots in and around Rajdhani School. According to the police, it was on his directions that the adjacent and rival convent school, two parking lots run by the other party and the building of one Anil Sweets was systematically destroyed by the mob.The police said in the charge sheet that the call detail analysis of Farooq’s phone suggested that he had links with prominent members of the Popular Front of India, Pinjra Tod group, Jamia Coordination Committee, Hazrat Nizamuddin Markaz and some fundamental Muslim clerics, including those from Deoband, indicating the depth of the conspiracy.The charge sheet stated that the rioters had camped inside and fired bullets from the terrace of Rajdhani School. They also threw petrol bombs, acid, bricks, stones and other missiles using an improvised large iron catapult, specially installed for the purpose, from the terrace of Rajdhani School. Police had also said that on the day of the riots, many children from Muslim families had left the school early during the half-time recess. HT contacted the police’s crime branch chief, Praveer Ranjan and police spokesperson Mandeep Randhawa, but despite many calls and text message, there was no response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/school-principal-granted-bail-in-delhi-riots-case/story-v7T3aWASw6JbiNh2XHsJVI.html

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||BEHBAL KALAN FIRING: Car dealer arrested for aiding cops in fabricating evidence||The special investigation team (SIT) probing the 2015 police firing on people protesting the Bargari sacrilege in Faridkot on Saturday arrested a car dealer for allegedly aiding accused cops in making fabricated bullet marks on the escort vehicle of Charanjit Singh Sharma, former Moga senior superintendent of police, and an accused in the Behbal Kalan case, to construct a fake self-defence theory.This is the second arrest by the SIT in Behbal Kalan firing case in a week. On June 16, a Faridkot-based lawyer, Sohali Singh Brar, was arrested by SIT for his alleged role in fabricating evidence in the Behbal Kalan police firing. He was sent in four-day police custody (till Sunday). Three accused has been arrested so far in the case, including former Moga SSP, who is on interim bail on health grounds. Inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who is a senior member of the SIT, said Pankaj Bansal, owner of Pankaj Motors, Moga, then having automobile workshop in Faridkot, has been arrested for aiding accused on fabricating false self-defence theory. “We will produce him in the court along with Brar and seek police custody of both,” he added. Two youths had died in police firing on October 14, 2015, while protesting against the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib at Bargari on October 12. Police had also opened fire on protesters at Kotkapura, leaving many injured, the same day.In its probe, the SIT found that Charanjit Sharma conspired with three other police officers — Fazilka superintendent of police Bikramjit Singh, inspector Pardip Singh and sub-inspector Amarjit Singh Kular — to cover up facts related to the Behbal Kalan firing.The SIT has claimed that to fabricate false evidence against the peaceful protesters, Charanjit’s escort Maruti Gypsy was taken to the advocate’s house, where Bikramjit and a car dealer had fired on it to make bullet marks. The same day, Kular, who was the Bajakhana station house officer, recorded the statements of Sharma, Bikramjit and Pardip Singh among others, in which they claimed that police fired in self-defence after protestors attacked them.The SIT probe found that Bansal played key role in the facilitating the accused cops for creating the fake evidence in the case after the police firing incident. However, in its chargesheet filed in the court in April last year, the SIT had claimed the weapon used to make fabricated bullet marks was provided by Bansal, but now SIT has changed the theory and claim Brar’s weapon was used in the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/behbal-kalan-firing-car-dealer-arrested-for-aiding-cops-in-fabricating-evidence/story-8MYC6kOAGDWTIYFyvhADwM.html
20-06-2020||City||Demolition drive carried out in illegal colonies in Bhondsi||Gurugram: An enforcement team of department of town and country planning (DTCP) on Saturday carried out a demolition drive in three unauthorized colonies coming up in Bhondsi. The colonies were being illegally developed over 20 acres of land, officials said, adding that they demolished 20 plinths in a developing colony, a long road network and major structure being used as an office by a property dealer. RS Bhath, district town planner, said that the demolition drive was conducted after it was revealed in a survey that constructions were coming up in the unauthorised colony. “We have asked our officials to visit all the areas where such colonies are coming up. Concerned residents also report violations with regard to new constructions,” he said.Bhath further said that plot owners in the area were also told not to start construction as the colonies were not authorised and legal action would be taken against them if they continue construction in violation of rules. “We have also decided to demolish the complete structure built by owners instead of just removing the boundary walls as it has been observed that owners resumed construction after some time,” he said.The DTCP officials were supported by a team of 100 police personnel, who ensured that there was no untoward incident during the demolition drive. On Friday, the enforcement team had sealed a number of houses in Sushant Lok 1 for violating the building plans after obtaining occupation certificates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/demolition-drive-carried-out-in-illegal-colonies-in-bhondsi/story-Ia2Vnrik9Esl712RZGR0OJ.html

20-06-2020||Gurugram||Officials asked to prepare for monsoon, MLA visits key locations||To ensure that waterlogging, which has become a perennial feature during the monsoon, does not cause a deluge this year, Gurugram MLA Sudhir Singla on Saturday asked officials of various civic agencies to ensure that the city’s drains are clean, pump-sets functional, and a list of emergency personnel is ready so that work takes place in a coordinated manner when it rains. Singla also inspected several key locations in the city and on the Delhi-Gurgaon Expressway along with officials of the NHAI, PWD, MCG, GMDA and the fire department to take stock of the preparations on the ground. In 2016, heavy rains in the city had caused a 20-hour jam, bringing the city to a standstill; since then the authorities have been trying to ensure that a similar situation does not arise during the monsoon. Keeping this in mind, Singla said that he had decided to take weekly updates from officials of different departments concerning the prevailing situation. “I will be visiting these spots regularly so that the system remains on its toes,” he said, adding that though officials have assured him that there would be no problems this year, the result would be clear when it starts raining.During the inspection at Hero Honda Chowk, which is one of the worst-affected areas during the monsoon, the Gurugram MLA told NHAI and MCG officials to ensure that the height of the breaker used to prevent water from entering the underpass was adequate. “Ensure that pumps are functional, operators are deployed 24/7 and clean drains immediately. Ensure that there is no reverse flow of water which can flood the area,” Singla told NHAI officials.At Rajiv Chowk, where a part of the surface crossing gets waterlogged towards the mini-secretariat, the GMDA and NHAI officials were asked to either raise the depression or install a pump to ensure water does not collect. Taking into account the waterlogging at Rajiv Chowk underpass in front of Medanta hospital, Singla went to check the water-breaker and the two pumps installed inside the Tau Devi Lal stadium. “Ensure that these pumps deliver during the critical situation and increase the height of the breaker if needed,” he told officials.Referring to waterlogging at underpasses, Pradip Kumar, GMDA chief engineer, said that all agencies are working in unison to ensure that it doesn’t take place this year.At Signature Tower crossing and Iffco Chowk L-shaped underpass, officials assured the MLA that drains have been cleaned and connections with the master lines checked. “We have conducted the drill for pumps and installed eight booster pumps. A drill has also been conducted and a list of operators will be made available to the authorities and the MLA in next couple of days,” Vikas Mittal, manager, NHAI, said.At Atul Kataria chowk, PWD officials were asked to ensure that the earth spread around the crossing was covered within the next five days. “I have asked officials to ensure that drains constructed here are made functional at the earliest,” he said.Rajeev Yadav, superintendent engineer, PWD, who was present, said that they would finish the work in the next few days and ensure that there is no waterlogging.At Mahavir Chowk near Sadar Bazar, PWD officials told Singla that the construction of the flyover and underpass has been delayed due to the lockdown, but they will ensure that the work is completed by May 2021, though the project deadline was December 2020. The officials said that they have taken measures to ensure that there is no waterlogging at the chowk, and drains are properly cleaned.GMDA executive engineer Rajesh Bansal, MCG chief engineer ND Vashisht, Bharat Bhushan Jindal from NHAI and fire official Sunil Kumar were present during the visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/officials-asked-to-prepare-for-monsoon-mla-visits-key-locations/story-Gx8uRLIIzHH1XJUkqpHgyO.html

20-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram: MCG looks for CSR funds as stock of protective gears nears depletion||The municipal corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is fast running out of protective equipment needed to fight the coronavirus disease, which has been surging in the city in the last few weeks.Among the items are gloves, head covers, vitamin-C tablets (to boost immunity), sanitisers and biscuits. Since March 25, the MCG stored these items at its central store in sector 42 for distribution to government hospitals, health care workers and police personnel who are on the front lines of fighting the pandemic in the district.On April 22, the civic body had around 386,000 gloves, 36,000 vitamin C tablets, 74,000 packets of biscuits, 15,000 bottles of sanitizers, 16,000 personal protection equipment (PPE) kits and 900 headcovers. Almost 98% of the items were procured through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds.By June 18, this had reduced to 14,000 gloves, 312 packets of biscuits, and 11,000 hand sanitizers; while vitamin C tablets and head covers were exhausted.The MCG is now appealing for large-scale donations from corporate companies to re-stock, else health care workers will be left in a lurch.“Prima facie, our current stocks may appear extremely low against the one which we had two months ago. The reason is mainly due to the fact that all such supplies have been distributed to the health department and Gurugram police on multiple occasions, over the last two months, in bulk. We have now reached out to several corporate companies and are expecting big donations from them to fill up our stock soon,” said Hariom Attri, joint commissioner, MCG, who is the nodal officer of the central store.Another official from the MCG, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that if the civic body isn’t able to get any new donations within the next three weeks, they could be facing a complete absence of all the protective gear that they were responsible for procuring, barring face masks. “In March and April we were regularly getting large donations through CSR funds from various companies. However, such donations have come down significantly since. With the cases of coronavirus rising this month and simultaneously items being distributed to the health department at a swifter rate, the once-fully stocked store is now running low on resources as items are being distributed much faster than it can be replenished,” said an MCG official privy to the matter.He further said that last week the stock of masks at the central store had reduced to just 65,000. However, a donation of 500,000 masks from an automobile company saved them.“We are in talks with a real estate company that has verbally agreed to donate but has not committed to any timeline. If we don’t get supplies within three weeks, then all items, barring masks, will be over,” the official said.On April 22, there were 41 coronavirus cases in the city. On June 18, the total number of cases has risen to 3991. HT had reported on April 23, the well-stocked MCG that had enough protective equipment that it had started donating to nearby cities such as Faridabad and Mewat as well.On Saturday, Haryana reported 10,223 cases (480 fresh cases) and 149 deaths (5 new deaths), resulting in a mortality rate of 1.45%. At 4,307 (171 new) Gurugram has 37% of the total case load in the state, and 59 deaths.Despite multiple attempts, Gurugram chief medical officer Virender Yadav could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-mcg-looks-for-csr-funds-as-stock-of-protective-gears-nears-depletion/story-gUjMXMECQ7Dcel4YQ934KN.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Raid chemists, manufactures to check overpricing, poor quality of sanitisers, masks: Punjab& Haryana HC||The high court has directed governments of Punjab and Haryana and Chandigarh administration to conduct raids at chemist shops and drug manufacturers to ascertain quality of sanitisers and masks being sold in view of Covid-19 outbreak and also whether their pricing is as per the notification of the central government.The high court bench of justice Amol Rattan Singh issued these suo motu directions while hearing a petition from a Hisar medical firm booked under the Essential Commodities Act for allegedly cheating people by selling a disinfectant as sanitiser for which it did not have licence. The March 21 notification of the Centre stipulates that all hand sanitisers shall not be priced at more than ₹100 per 200 ml. The court observed that most companies manufacturing and selling hand sanitisers, even after March 21, 2020, are showing the maximum retail price of such products to be far above fixed by the government. Hence, court directed additional chief secretaries/ principal secretaries/secretaries of the departments of health, and food and supplies of both the states and Chandigarh, to have ‘raids’ conducted at chemist shops and manufacturing units, to obtain samples of hand sanitisers/hand disinfectants and wherever those are manufactured after March 2020, showing a maximum retail price above beyond fixed by government action be initiated against the manufacturer or chemist, whosoever is violating the notification.The court also observed that a large number of brands of facial masks are being found of highly sub-standard quality. “Where even while tying the masks, the strings attached break off immediately, thereby making the masks unusable. Consequently, in the ‘raids’ to be conducted, boxes of masks/individual masks shall also be collected by those of the ‘raiding party’, with the masks to be tested as regards this basic issue of breaking of strings, and if such breaking is found, or the masks are otherwise found to be of sub-standard quality, proceedings as per law shall be taken against all concerned,” the court ordered. The officers have been asked to file personal affidavits on July 6 on the raids conducted and the results. Further, the court also directed the lawyers associated with the case to immediately inform chief secretaries of both the states and UT adviser so that compliance is ensured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/raid-chemists-manufactures-to-check-overpricing-poor-quality-of-sanitisers-masks-punjab-haryana-hc/story-XboQko6ETDVaBOeZa7CC2L.html

The protesters were booked by the district police.There was no response from Oppo to an email by HT by the time this story was published. Volunteers and members of the Hindu Raksha Dal protested outside the plant for more than two hours. “We even requested the government to shut down all Chinese companies in the country which should be a lesson to China who will think before any attacks on our country,” said Pinky Chaudhary, president, Hindu Raksha Dal. The volunteers claimed that the protest was conducted while maintaining norms of social distancing. They put on symbolic locks on the company’s gates. A police team was later rushed. “There were many people. Local cops rushed to maintain public order. The group gave their memorandum to ACP after which they left,” said Rajesh Kumar Singh, DCP, zone 3.

20-06-2020||City||Greater Noida: Builders fined for not taking dust control measures||Noida: The Uttar Pradesh Pollution Control Board (UPPCB) on Saturday slapped a fine of ₹5 lakh on a builder developing a group housing project in Greater Noida for not taking adequate anti-pollution measures during construction. This is the second time in the past two days that the UPPCB has slapped a fine on entities over irresponsible construction activities leading to air pollution.On Thursday, another builder was imposed a penalty of ₹5 lakh over the same reason. Officials said Thursday’s fine was the first in the district after construction was allowed to restart from May 4, following weeks of lockdown to curb the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.“We had received a complaint through social media that construction activities in a Greater Noida sector were creating inconvenience and generating a lot of dust. Upon inspection, it was found construction was leading to dust. Construction materials like sand were also not covered. There were no dust controlling measures taken by the builder, that’s why an environmental compensation of ₹5 lakh was imposed,” said Archana Dwivedi, regional officer, UPPCB.“An official letter has been sent to the city magistrate to collect the fine of ₹5 lakh each from both builders,” Dwivedi added.As construction activities restarted in Gautam Budh Nagar, the district has been seeing a slight drop in air quality. The air quality index (AQI) during the national lockdown had come down to the ‘satisfactory’ category (AQI of 50 to 100). However, the current trend of air quality is under the ‘moderate’ category, which is an AQI of 100 to 200.“The air quality in the region is a cause of concern again as it’s deteriorating slowly with construction activities resuming in the region. At some places in NCR, the air quality is back to the ‘poor’ category and the volume of both PM2.5 and PM10 is increasing. Also, during summers, dust from construction activities contributes to PM2.5 levels. It is highly advised to ensure that C&D (construction and demolition) and dust mitigation guidelines are adhered to,”said Shambhavi Shukla, programme officer (air quality), Centre for Science and Environment (CSE). Earlier this month, it was revealed in an RTI that only 10 out of 45 major construction sites and industries have installed anti-smog guns -- a major pollution control measure. The anti-smog gun, as directed by the Supreme Court in January, should be used in the NCR at project sites dealing with excavation, material handling and other dust-generating activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/greater-noida-builders-fined-for-not-taking-dust-control-measures/story-FE2JyyqiqjbmqeD3ylvvqO.html
20-06-2020||City||Polythene returns to Noida markets as admin attention shifts to Covid||Noida: While authorities are busy dealing with the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, the old menace of plastic bags has returned to the city even as the ban on single-use plastic continues.Banned by the state government in 2018, which was reinstated in 2019 by the Noida authority, single-use plastics – especially polythene bags – are now being used uninhibited across markets in Noida, especially by vegetable vendors and even some super-markets.“Many customers do bring their own bags but if they don’t, many often quarrel over the bags that we provide, as they don’t want to pay ₹10 to ₹20 extra for a bag. So we had to supply the polythene bags which we give free of cost. Everyone is using it and we have to cater to the demand of the customers as well. So far we have seen no objection,” said a grocery store owner in Sector-76, who did not wish to be named.Vegetable vendors reiterated the sentiment, saying customers often don’t bring their own bags and that the jute or cloth bags are expensive.“Due to the lockdown, sales have dropped a lot. We used to set up a shop at a local vegetable market in Sector 77 but that has been closed due to the ongoing crisis. At such a time, all we care about is getting our business back on track. Almost everyone is using polythene bags now and there are no issues with supply either,” said a roadside fruit and vegetable vendor at the Sector 50 market.Last year in a massive drive held in October, a total 30 tonnes of different forms of single-use plastics, most of which were polythene bags, were collected by the Noida authority, which was later disposed as fuel in cement factories. An additional two tonnes was confiscated by the authority and administration from different shops, restaurants and road side vendors. The state government’s ban came on July 15, 2018. The Uttar Pradesh Plastic and Other Non-Biodegradable Garbage (Regulation of Use and Disposal) Act, 2000, was amended and an ordinance was issued for this.According to the ordinance, punishment for violations for the first conviction can result in a month prison term or a fine of a minimum of ₹1,000 and a maximum of ₹10,000. The second or subsequent conviction can incur a prison term of six months or a fine of a minimum of ₹5,000 and a maximum of ₹25,000.Officials of the Noida authority said while the ban is still under effect, a lot could have slipped due to the lockdown, imposed to curb the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic.“The current status is that plastic is still banned, however, during the lockdown, obviously the priorities were entirely different and thus there could be issues with compliances. But now as markets are reopening, we will soon restart vigilance. Single use plastics will not be tolerated in the city,” said Avinash Tripathi, officer on special duty, health, Noida Authority.“Last year we seized and punctured 1.5 to two tonnes of single use plastics from different shops and they are yet to be disposed of,” Tripathi added.Officials also pointed out that during the lockdown, some volunteers also distributed food packets in polythene bags, who were later requested to switch to non-plastic alternatives. According to environmentalists, though the helplessness of authorities during the lockdown is understood as a lot of people wanted to use disposable carry bags and other items, the authorities should now, however, start taking the menace seriously. “During lockdown there were certain compulsions, but now the unlocking has started. Shops are reusing plastic bags and since we have to live with Covid-19 now, it is better we not get used to plastic again, which is nothing less than a pandemic itself. The authority should start looking into it,” said Vikrant Tongad, city-based environmentalist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/polythene-returns-to-noida-markets-as-admin-attention-shifts-to-covid/story-PzZAYFHvgB3ZJvLa8dppHN.html

20-06-2020||City||Office of Ghaziabad CMO sealed after two staff test positive, Covid-19 cases cross 850||Ghaziabad: The office of chief medical officer (CMO) of the district was sealed on Saturday for two days after two staff members tested positive for Covid-19. The office will now be sanitized as per protocols, CMO Dr NK Gupta said, adding that he has directed for sampling of all the staff members.“One of the two staff members is a clerk while the other is a driver. They showed symptoms and their test reports came positive for the infection. As a result, we have sealed the office for two days and sanitization is being taken up,” Gupta said.The office of the CMO is located inside the premises of the Combined District Hospital in Sanjay Nagar, which is now a dedicated L2 hospital. Earlier, the district women’s hospital had to shut on June 17 after Covid-19 patients were found. Later, tests of five doctors, including chief medical superintendent, and six nurses and four other staff members were conducted. The hospital was also closed for the same reason on May 25. “The sampling of doctors, staff nurses and other employees was done on June 18. These employees had attended the OPD, where patients were found positive. However, we are yet to get the reports,” said Dr Deepa Tyagi, chief medical superintendent of the hospital.Meanwhile, the health department is now focussing on more sampling through the surveillance teams and has deployed a team each at Vaishali, Khoda, IMS college Dasna and Sanjay Nagar hospital.“The surveillance teams have been asked to focus more on people who have symptoms of severe acute respiratory infections (SARI) and influenza-like illness (ILI). The teams will check up patients with such symptoms and send them to the nearest sampling centre. The idea is to detect such cases at the earliest and get them medical treatment before the cases get into a critical state,” CMO said.On Saturday, the tally of Covid-19 cases crossed 800 with addition of 56 new cases. This is the biggest single day spike in number of Covid-19 positive cases in Ghaziabad, health officials said.The total positive cases stood at 853, while the number of deaths was 42 which included Saturday’s two deaths. The total number of patients discharged so far stands at 504.“Till Saturday we have 42 deaths, of which 16 have taken place in Ghaziabad, 14 at Meerut and two each in Delhi and Noida,” CMO added.Out of 56 new cases, three were from Modinagar, five from delta colonies of Surya Nagar, Brij Vihar and Ramprastha, five from Shalimar Garden, seven from Indirapuram, two from Vasundhara and one from Vaishali, among others.In a period of 20 days since June 1, 548 positive cases and 38 deaths have been added to the overall tally, the officials said.“Since the number of cases is on the rise, the CM has directed for better work plan for NCR areas of the state. He has also directed to strengthen health care infrastructure, surveillance system and also laid stress on increasing the random sampling in these areas,” said Awanish Awasthi, UP’s additional chief secretary (home).The UP CM had also sent special officers to 11 sensitive districts, including Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, to assess the Covid-19 situation. The two nodal officers sent to Ghaziabad have also completed their week-long visit on Saturday.“The officers will be sending a confidential report to the state government and the report is likely to highlight the shortcomings they observed in Ghaziabad and corrective measures which are needed to be taken up to tackle the Covid-19 spread,” said an officer from the Ghaziabad administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/office-of-ghaziabad-cmo-sealed-after-two-staff-test-positive-covid-19-cases-cross-850/story-lYA1SsOnEb4hVYOEB3R8WK.html
20-06-2020||City||With new discharge guidelines, Ghaziabad hopes for more vacant beds, better recovery rate||The health department officials said they are going to defer the opening of 200-bed Covid L1 hospital ( to treat non-critical cases) in Niwari as they expect more beds to be vacated in the operational L1 hospitals in the wake of the government revising the discharge policy on June 19. This is for the second time in the past one month that the government has revised guidelines for discharge of Covid-19 patients. At present, the Ghaziabad district has two operational L1 hospitals at Sahibabad (76 beds) and Nandgram (60 beds) while L2 hospital (100 beds) at Sanjay Nagar besides 400-bedded L3 category hospital of Santosh Hospital.According to the new guidelines, an asymptomatic patient can be discharged, without having to undergo any test, on the 10th day from the date of admission. But, such persons will have to remain in home quarantine for seven days after discharge.Currently, all symptomatic and asymptomatic patients are to be admitted to dedicated Covid hospitals in the state. Earlier, asymptomatic patients were discharged only if their test report came negative for Covid-19. “We are expecting that more patients will get discharged from our L1 hospitals as the discharge guidelines have been changed. So we will delay the opening of our new L1 hospital in Niwari,” Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer, Ghaziabad, said.For discharge of patients with mild symptoms, the new guidelines state that they will have to be without symptoms for three consecutive days.“Such patients will then undergo a test on the Tru-Net machine, either three days after showing no symptoms or on the 12th day from the date of admission, whichever is later. If their report is negative, they can be discharged. All patients showing moderate to severe symptoms will be referred to L2 or L3 hospitals, which are dedicated to treating more critical Covid-19 cases,” the CMO said.The officials said until now, patients with mild/moderate or severe Covid-19 symptoms such as fever, cough, etc were also being discharged after a single negative test report. “The revised guidelines will help us discharge more active cases in the coming days and this will reduce the burden on us to open new L1 hospitals. As a general observation, we have about 75-80% cases which are asymptomatic. So, there is a need to open more L1 hospitals. During the recent interactions will government appointed nodal officers, we have been asked to create bigger L1 hospitals will 200-400 bed capacity,” Dr Gupta said.“With revised guidelines, we expect that our recovery rate will also go up,” he said.As of now, the district health department had planned L1 hospitals at 13 different colleges with a combined capacity of about 4,000 beds in order to deal with any future surge in number of Covid-19 cases.With the rising number of cases, especially in the month of June, the discharge rate of Ghaziabad district stands at 53.82% at present. On May 31, the recovery rate was 76.39%.On the other hand, the current fatality rate is 5.01% (till June 19), while it was 1.31% on May 31.“The government appointed nodal officers have stressed on reducing the death rate and increasing surveillance activities. For early detection of cases, we have come with help desk facilities where the general public will be scanned with infrared thermometers and pulse oxymeters. These help desks are at primary health centres, community health centres and government offices,” Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, said.Till June 19, Ghaziabad has a total of 797 Covid-19 cases,with 328 of them till active, while 429 have been discharged so far. The death from the disease is 40.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/with-new-discharge-guidelines-ghaziabad-hopes-for-more-vacant-beds-better-recovery-rate/story-nlMAUxcFivSHwm6uN1AuPM.html

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Amid Covid-19 management, Tribune flyover project put on the back burner||With the UT administration scrambling to stem the spread of Covid-19, the controversial Tribune flyover project has been relegated to the background.The ₹183-crore project—flyover, underpass and elevated rotary—was approved by the Union ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) in February 2019 to decongest the Tribune rotary on the Dakshin Marg.But in November last year, the Punjab and Haryana high court, while staying the removal of trees for the project’s construction, had asked the UT adviser to seek public views on alternatives for the project. UT is yet to submit the report with the HC, further leading to uncertainty over the much-hyped project.REPORT TO BE SUBMITTED SOON: PARIDAUT adviser Manoj Kumar Parida said that the UT will soon submit the report with the HC. It was delayed because senior UT officials had recommended taking the views of the administrator’s advisory council on the issue, he said, adding, in the current circumstances, the administration is unlikely to take the council’s views.“As uncertainty continues to prevail over the project, the delay will cause price escalation of construction. An early decision on the matter should be pursued so that if the flyover is constructed, even with changed design, its cost shouldn’t become too high,” said a UT engineering department official.On December 23, comments from the public were invited on the flyover project. Of the total 78 persons/groups that came forward, 53 were against the project. Later, the administration also took views of Punjab and Haryana governments. Earlier this year, the MC had passed a resolution in favour of the administration’s plan to construct the flyover.TECHNICAL PANEL CONSTITUTEDAfter the hearing, the UT adviser, last year, had constituted a technical committee headed by the UT finance secretary to examine the technical suggestions on alternatives to the project.The committee comprising senior UT officials and chief engineers from Punjab, Haryana and the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) had termed the alternatives as unviable. In the report, the committee analysed each of the seven alternatives and gave conclusions on each, individually. The reasons for rejection of each project were also given.Rejecting all alternatives, the committee had recommended that the opinion of MoRTH on the issue should also be taken. But the UT had rejected this recommendation, and instead is mulling to take the MC’s advice.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/amid-covid-19-management-tribune-flyover-project-put-on-the-back-burner/story-XhlXzn1GxOcAxmJKACD0VL.html

20-06-2020||Mumbai||Implement SC order, give Covid test reports directly to patients: HC||The Bombay high court (HC) on Saturday directed the state and Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to implement the Supreme Court (SC) order to hand over Covid-positive reports directly to patients. The court, while hearing the plea filed by Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) corporator Vinod Mishra from Malad, was informed by BMC that the petition was not maintainable and should have been a public interest litigation (PIL). The court, however, said that in light of the Apex Court order, it would not interfere, and issued the said directions.The division bench of justice SJ Kathawalla and justice Nitin Borkar, while hearing the petition filed by Mishra, challenging a circular issued by BMC on June 13 regarding the revised test reports rule, was informed by advocates Amogh Singh and Jeet Gandhi that SC on Friday had directed the state government to give the reports directly to the patients. In light of their grievance being addressed, they sought the petition to be disposed of.Senior counsel for the BMC, however, challenged the maintainability of the petition, stating that the issue was of general public well-being and should have been filed as a PIL. He further submitted a reply by BMC authorities that was not accepted by the bench as it was not an affirmed copy.In light of the above and the fact that the Apex Court had already issued an order, the high court directed the state and civic authorities to implement the Supreme Court order and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/implement-sc-order-give-covid-test-reports-directly-to-patients-hc/story-z1XR1EvXXBV9fhwsCKfhJL.html

The family members told the minister that their kin are currently detained in camps in Malaysia after completion of their prison sentences for illegal stay. The youth had been duped by travel agents who had taken them to Malaysia on the pretext of employment but they had to fend for themselves and in the process, they overstayed in Malaysia.After listening to them, the Union minister called up the Indian high commissioner in Malaysia and asked him to help the youth in every possible way and ensure their safety and security.She also requested the high commissioner to depute an officer from the embassy to visit the youth and facilitate their communication with their families in Punjab.YAD president Parambans Romana said feedback states that some of the stranded youth did not have any funds to purchase a return ticket. “The YAD will bear the travel expenses of such youths,” he said in a statement issued by the office of the Union minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/harsimrat-urges-mea-to-facilitate-return-of-youth-stuck-in-malaysia/story-3DkuhBMBrmLFbbNyLQQ2eN.html
20-06-2020||Mumbai||Holding final-year exams will delay new academic year: Colleges||A day after the Maharashtra education department decided that final-year exams for non-professional courses across 14 state universities will be made optional, colleges and universities are looking at a Herculean task ahead.As per the government’s directive, each of the 7.3 lakh final-year students, studying across state universities, will have to submit a written undertaking to their respective universities and state whether they wish to write the exam.University of Mumbai (MU), with 2.8 lakh final-year students alone, will depend on its affiliated colleges to collect the written undertakings and submit them to the university.“The government resolution (GR) is applicable to everyone, and students will soon be informed of the deadline for submitting written undertakings. As of now, we are focusing on putting together a system to ensure exams are conducted for interested students,” said Vinod Patil, controller of examinations, MU.Colleges affiliated to MU feel that most students will opt out of the examinations, since they have been provided the option of appearing for a re-examination in the next academic year, to better their score. “Holding examinations so late in the year will be very unproductive. We hope the admissions process begins soon so that we can start work on the next academic year,” said the principal of a college in south Mumbai.The government resolution released on Friday had also highlighted that holding examinations will involve several tasks, including setting of question papers, arrangement of answer booklets, assessment of papers, as well as announcement of results. The resolution pointed out that if a single person involved in this process tests positive for Covid-19, there will be a possibility of the virus spreading to a large number of people.It further stated that the entire process will take time, eating into the schedule of the next academic year.Through a Facebook Live session on Friday evening, state minister for higher and technical education Uday Samant announced that while a decision on final-year exams of professional courses will be taken based on the decision of individual exam councils, the state government will hold exams for only those students from non-professional courses who are ready to give a written undertaking about the same. “Exams will be held in the near future, keeping social distancing norms in mind,” said Samant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/holding-final-year-exams-will-delay-new-academic-year-colleges/story-3FUE5oxD2yaGhjtMoBS4rJ.html

The state government has faced flack from the opposition parties including SAD after the HT highlighted the matter.In a fresh circular issued on Saturday, the SDM withdrew the order, in which he directed teachers to keep a check on trucks and tractor-trailers (carrying sand or mud) coming from other areas, on the various checkpoints in Phagwara.Teachers, along with the cops, asked to remain at checkpoints and submit their daily report of truck or tractor-trailers checked to the SDM office. The administration has appointed around 30 teachers to perform the duty between 9pm to 1am in Phagwara.Earlier in May this year, Gurdaspur deputy commissioner’s office posted teachers outside four distilleries to keep an eye on smuggling. The orders were later withdrawn.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/phagwara-admn-withdraws-order-of-deputing-teachers-to-check-illegal-mining/story-s4INoJx4meeqcogTyuaEFK.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||83 community transmission cases in Amritsar in 5 days||The district administration and the health department are on toes as the Covid-19 spread in the community is increasing rapidly in Amritsar, with 83 cases being reported in five days where the patient had no travel history or been in proximity to an infected person from outside the state.After relaxations in the lockdown were announced on May 19, it took 17 days (till June 5) for the district to record 100 community transmission cases and next 10 days (till June 15) to reach 200-mark of community transmission cases. However, the community transmission cases showed a sudden spike in the last five days as 83 more cases got added to the list. To date, the district, which has been put in the ‘red-zone’ category, has recorded 752 Covid-19 cases, of which 499 patients have recovered and 31 had succumbed to the disease.Since May 19, over 445 Covid-19 cases were reported in the district of which 283, approximately 63%, are community transmission cases. Sixty-six such cases surfaced on Thursday, Friday and Saturday alone.“These community transmission patients were tested in flu corners after they showed symptoms of the disease. Their source of infection could not be traced yet but the administration and health department have made three containment and two micro-containment zones in the district, to further contain the spread of the disease. The cases are being increased rapidly as the lockdown was uplifted and people are community in the market without taking precautionary measures,” said civil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore.“Also, to control its spread and to find out how much the community has been infected, we are taking over 1,000 swab samples daily from the district, which is being tested at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH). The recovery rate in Amritsar is high and the active patients will soon get recovered,” he said. ESI HOSPITAL CLOSED AFTER PHARMACIST TESTS POSITIVEA day after a pharmacist of ESI Hospital, Amritsar, tested positive for Covid-19 the hospital has been temporarily closed.“A team of the health department visited the ESI Hospital where a pharmacist was found infected. The swab samples of the entire staff have been taken for testing and disinfectants were sprayed. Till the reports of all the staff members are awaited, the hospital will be closed. The close contacts of the pharmacist have been quarantined,” said Dr Kishore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/83-community-transmission-cases-in-amritsar-in-5-days/story-MkK19yFYr36OMGWvKAsJ2N.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Covid-19 makes yoga popular in Chandigarh, but hits instructors, institutes badly||The coronavirus pandemic has motivated residents to adopt a healthy lifestyle and boost their immune systems, and yoga is turning out to be one of the favourite fitness routines.Followers of this ancient practice have increased manyfold in the last two to three months, but in spite of that, the pandemic has hit professional yoga instructors and training institutes badly. Due to fears of spread, residents are avoiding engaging instructors, thus costing them their monthly incomes. Training institutes across the region are the worst hit. With no footfall and heavy rentals to pay, many of the centres have closed down or are at the verge of doing so. “Yoga industry is one of the worst hit sectors,” says yoga expert Harimindra Singh, 30, who is the co-founder of Rishikesh Yoga Association, a training institute located in the Yoga Capital of the World, Rishikesh, in Uttarakhand.“There are over 100 institutes here, catering annually to over 20,000-25,000 enthusiasts, 80% of them foreigners. But for the last three months, there hasn’t been a single admission, and with monthly rentals to pay, institutes are finding it hard to survive,” adds Harimindra.The yoga industry of Rishikesh provides lucrative job opportunities to many yoga instructors from Chandigarh.INCOMES HALVED WITH ONLINE CLASSESAt a time when physical classes have become obsolete, many instructors are turning to the alternative of offering classes online. But that is not nearly enough as regards the number of clients they used to have before the lockdown.“During the lockdown our first motive was to engage our old clients, so we started online classes. But we are charging only half the usual amount,” says yoga instructor Mandeep Lal, who works in Chandigarh. “Earlier, on an average, a yoga instructor would earn somewhere between ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 monthly. This has been reduced to half or less,” he adds.Many instructors from India got the opportunity to work overseas, and had been earning decent money. “In Vietnam, people have started visiting the centres, but right now I am earning one-fourth what I used to earn before Covid,” says Chandigarh-based yoga expert Munish Kumar, who runs four centres under the name of Shine Yoga School in Vietnam. “Before lockdown, I had 11 students training to become teachers. Now, only five of them want to continue saying they can’t afford the course anymore,” he adds. The course fee is $1,500 (₹1.14 lakh).With a hike in the number of people practising yoga daily, the demand for yoga accessories has also gone up. To keep yoga institutes afloat, some equipment companies are extending them financial help. “My friend, who is a distributor of famous yoga equipment company Manduka in Singapore and Vietnam, tells me that there has been a decent increase in the sale of yoga accessories now. The top yoga equipment companies have also come up with schemes to extend some financial help to the institutes,” says Munish.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/covid-19-makes-yoga-popular-in-chandigarh-but-hits-instructors-institutes-badly/story-eZOwRNtX2mCyhVuD0YeVXP.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Lockdown delays truck scanner project at Attari-Wagah border||The coronavirus-induced nationwide lockdown has hit the operation of the full-body truck scanner installed at the integrated checkpost (ICP) Attari, which facilitates India’s trade with Afghanistan and Pakistan through the Attari-Wagah border. Officials of the Land Ports Authority of India (LPAI), which manages the ICP’s affairs, said they are waiting certification from the Atomic Energy Regulatory Board (AERB) as a team of experts could not visit the ICP for conducting the scanner’s trial due to lockdown. The truck scanner project costing Rs 23 crore was announced in March 2017 by then Union minister of state for home affairs Kiran Rijiju. Of the five truck scanners imported from the US, the first one has been installed at the ICP, Attari, to scan concealed narcotics and weapons being smuggled from Pakistan.The Centre had sanctioned five FBTS for Attari–Wagha in Punjab, Poonch–Chakkandabad and Uri–Salamabad in Jammu & Kashmir on the India-Pakistan border, Petrapole in Kolkata at India–Bangladesh border and Raxaul in Bihar on India–Nepal border.Since the foundation stone of the ICP was laid in 2010, there has been a demand for a scanner as manual checking of vehicles by customs officials with the help of sniffer dogs is not 100% errorfree, and has sometimes led to clearing of the contraband.“The construction and installation works of the scanner have been completed. We are now waiting the AERB team’s visit. The team couldn’t reach here due to the coronavirus-induced lockdown. The scanner emits radiation. Once we get certification from the AERB, the scanner will be made operational. We have already put forward our request to the AERB to conduct the scanner’s trial,” said the ICP’s in-charge Sukhdev Singh. “In November last year, an AERB team had visited and during the trial of the scanner, a technical glitch was detected. The glitch was repaired by an US-based engineer. Now, the scanner is all set to be operational.”With the imposition of the nationwide lockdown, the movement of trade with Afghanistan thorough the ICP was also suspended for at least two months. The cross-border trade resumed from May 28, but only a few trucks have been importing goods from Afghanistan. However, trade with Pakistan is at a standstill since the New Delhi’s action of revoking the erstwhile Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. The project, which commenced in March 2018, has so far missed several deadlines. In July last year, the special cell of Delhi Police seized 50kg heroin evaluated at ₹200 crore from a cold storage located in Haryana’s Sonepat. The consignment had reportedly entered India through Attari ICP in a truck. In June, the customs department seized 532kg of heroin and 52kg of mixed narcotics concealed in the consignment of rock salt imported in a truck. The accused of the 532 kg heroin smuggling racket, as per the police and the National Investigation Agency (NIA), had already cleared five such consignments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/lockdown-delays-truck-scanner-project-at-attari-wagah-border/story-6L4Y9gtmzLH3aLaZmfumOM.html

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Capt calls all-party meet on farm sector ordinances||ChandigarhChief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has called an all-party meeting on June 24 over the issue of three ordinances related to the agriculture sector, recently passed by the Centre, state Congress chief Sunil Jakhar said on Saturday.“Views of all the parties will be taken to arrive at the consensus that these ordinances were against the interest of the farming community and we should approach the Centre and the prime minister over this issue,” Jakhar said.He said farming communities were up against this ‘kala kanoon’ (black law) and they have vehemently opposed these ordinances.“Under these laws, the efforts are being made to hand over the rights of farmers to the multinationals and big corporates,” he alleged and expressed fear that the Narendra Modi government had decided to “disband” the minimum support price (MSP) mechanism with these ordinances under a “planned move”.The Centre recently passed three ordinances, the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Ordinance, Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Ordinance, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Ordinance.The Centre had said these would transform the farm sector and help raise farmers’ income.However, the Congress government in Punjab had said these ordinances were completely against farmers and would badly hit the agrarian state.The amendment to the Essential Commodities Act was meant to deregulate food items, including cereals, pulses and onion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/capt-calls-all-party-meet-on-farm-sector-ordinances/story-k0Mfsl4aAumV4ZexKQt5xI.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Punjab basmati sees revival in export market as orders grow||Exporters of Punjab’s premium aromatic basmati rice are ecstatic as they have started getting orders from international buyers again even as they suffered a setback in 2018 when hundreds of consignments were returned by the European Union (EU) and countries in the Middle East due to traces of fungicide in the grain.The advance orders are mainly for the 1,121 and 1,718 varieties of the aromatic rice.The turnaround is being attributed to the fact that the state’s basmati growers have been able to control the use of fungicides and pesticides in the crop. Besides, amid the Covid-19 pandemic outbreak, the rice distributors in the destination countries are keen on piling up stocks, it is learnt.This time, basmati traders have started bookings even before the sowing of the crop. July 31 is the deadline to transplant basmati saplings. The exporters are targeting a sale over ₹36,000 crore after the harvest that will begin in October-November, an increase of 10-12% over the previous year.“Of the 40 lakh tonnes India exports every year, nearly 20 lakh tonne is exported from Punjab. The state’s border belt comprising Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts are main producers of the rice. Though Sangrur, Moga and Fazilka districts also grow the rice, the quality of rice cultivated there is not that fine,” said Ashok Sethi, director of the Basmati Exports Association.“This year, the exports from the state are expected to touch 23-24 lakh tonnes,” he added.“The basmati growers in Punjab are expected to make good profits this kharif season as prices of the produce are expected to touch ₹3,500 per quintal,” said state secretary (agriculture) Kahan Singh Pannu.Harpreet Singh, a farmer from Sarwali village in Batala, said, “If the exporters are claiming to be flush with orders, they should disclose what rate they will offer if our produce is as per the benchmark. The price of basmati per quintal has not gone beyond ₹3,000 for many years, with a minor fluctuation of ₹200-300.” THE 2018 EU CURBSIn 2018, when the European Union (EU) slapped new import restrictions on the issue of fungicide traces, at least 100 containers were sent back by Norway, Sweden, England and Finland, leading to huge losses to the local basmati exporters.The hardest hit from the decision were farmers in Punjab and Haryana, who have been using the fungicide for decades to protect their produce from the ‘rice blast disease’. The EU order in June 2018 had said the level of tricyclazole must be cut from 1.0 mg per kg to 0.01 mg.“We had assured the basmati importers that the fungicide traces will be reduced. Now, it has come down to permissible limits,” said Pannu.“We are motivating the farmers to expand the area under basmati cultivation and use minimum fungicide,” Sethi added.Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Syria, Kuwait, the European Union, and the North American countries are major basmati importers.Until 2018, Iran was a major importer of basmati as it would order 14 lakh tonnes of the rice every year.But last year, India became party to the trade sanctions imposed by the US on Iran, leading to halt on the basmati exports to the country. Even as Iran has no direct trade with India, it is expected to buy basmati from Dubai-based traders who import the aromatic rice from Punjab and elsewhere in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/punjab-basmati-sees-revival-in-export-market-as-orders-grow/story-6ZT8WKpKhkeaXoPDs7p1pJ.html

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Jaypee moves court for restoration of possession, MC put on notice for June 24||Jaypee group on Saturday moved court against municipal corporation’s takeover of the Dadumajra garbage processing plant, and sought restoration of the possession.Taking note of the plea, the court has put the civic body on notice, demanding a response by June 24.Meanwhile, on Friday, as MC took possession of the controversial plant, the court earlier in the day had already stayed the takeover for a month. However, the order could not be conveyed to the civic body in time.NK Vohra, local head, Jaypee, claimed, “MC’s counsel was present during the proceedings. We communicated the court’s decision to MC officials as well, but they still took possession forcibly. Our staff was also pushed out of the plant.”With the plant running much below its full capacity and resulting in dumping of garbage in the open in Dadumajra, the MC General House had terminated the contract with the firm and directed MC officials to take its possession in March this year. The civic body had issued a termination notice on March 5, asking the firm to hand over the plant within a week. On this, the firm moved court that ordered a stay for three months on March 12.After its elapse on June 12, MC after issuing a 24-hour notice on Thursday, took over the plant on Friday. “The stay order becomes infructuous with MC already taking over the plant,” said a senior MC official.On Saturday, the firm approached the court again for restoring the possession and ensure status quo ante (previously existing state of affairs). “We have also filed a contempt plea against MC, and it has been issued a notice by the court for June 24. The March 12 stay order had asked for arbitration proceedings to be started. We approached the arbitrator in May, but MC took possession of the plant in violation of the court order,” said Vohra.MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “We will be taking legal view on Monday, and then proceed accordingly.”Poor solid waste management remains a key reason for Chandigarh slipping in Swachh Survekshan rankings over the past couple of years.On its part, Jaypee has maintained that MC is responsible for the current performance of the plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/jaypee-moves-court-for-restoration-of-possession-mc-put-on-notice-for-june-24/story-2zD7zRlobfH2YELW0xD1nK.html

20-06-2020||Mumbai||Thanks to internet, 94-year-old woman who disappeared 40 years ago, reunites with family||Thanks to the Internet, a 94- year-old woman from Maharashtra who had gone missing four decades ago has been reunited with her family.Unfortunately, when Panchubai, the woman, reached her grandson’s house in Nagpur three days ago, she could not meet her son. He had died three years ago.Sometime in 1979-80, a truck driver spotted a woman, clueless and in a pitiable condition, walking along a road in Madhya Pradesh’s Damoh district.“She had been stung by honeybees and could not speak coherently,” Israr Khan, the truck driver’s son, told PTI.Khan’s father took the woman home and she began to live with his family. Israr himself was a baby then.“We called her Achchhan Mausi. She was mentally unstable and used to mutter in Marathi which we could not understand,” he said.“I sometimes asked her about her family, but she could not tell anything,” he said.Khan also wrote about her on Facebook, but it did not lead to anywhere.“She used to talk about a place called `Khanjma Nagar’. Google search of the name yielded no result. Then on May 4 this year, as we were at home amid lockdown, I again asked her about her hometown,” he said.“This time she spoke about a place called Parsapur. We googled it and found that there is one Paraspur in Maharashtra,” Khan said.On May 7, he contacted a man called Abhishek who runs a shop in Paraspur and told him about the woman.Abhishek, who belongs to the Kirar community, told him that there is a village called Khanjma Nagar near the town.“I sent him Mausi’s video at 8:30 pm on May 7, which he shared on a WhatsApp group of the Kirar community. I received a phone call from Abhishek around midnight, saying the woman had been identified and her relatives traced,” Khan said.A video of the old woman was sent to Prithvi Bhaiyalal Shingane, Panchubais grandson who lives in Nagpur. The Shingane family was astounded. They were eager to bring her home, but the wait was not yet over as lockdown was in force.Finally, on June 17, Shingane took his grandmother -- whose full name is Panchfulabai Tejpalsingh Shingane -- home.“We are natives of Khanjma Nagar in Achalpur tehsil in Amravati district of Maharashtra, but the family shifted to Nagpur about five decades ago,” he told PTI.“In 1979, my father brought my grandmother to Nagpur for treatment of her mental ailment from Khanjma Nagar. The doctors were optimistic about curing her. But one day she left home in the evening, telling neighbours that she was going to her father’s place, and disappeared for ever,” he said.“My father searched for her for years without success.He died in 2017.

No injury or casualty was reported as all workers had left the premises at 5pm, an hour before the fire erupted at Accutex Sales and Services situated on plot number 165.Fire officer Karam Chand Sood said though the exact reason is yet is ascertained, it seemed the fire broke out due to a short-circuit. “As a lot of inflammable items were stocked on the premises, the fire spread very fast. However, three fire tenders were rushed to the spot and took half an hour to douse the flames,” he said. “Though losses can’t be ascertained yet, we were able to save offices and some parts of the factory. However, furniture and other items were damaged.”Sources said further damage was controlled as firemen were able to take out domestic gas cylinders from the premises.The factory is engaged in manufacturing and exporting industrial components, including chrome-plated bars, broaching tools, burnishing tools, ceramic-coated pulleys, dies and moulds. The owners claimed they have suffered around ₹70 lakh losses.Electronics shop gutted in ZirakpurAn electronics shop was damaged after a short-circuit triggered fire in the basement of a shopping complex in Zirakpur on Friday night. Shop owner Saurav said he was present in the shop located in the basement of Peer Muchalla City Centre, when he saw smoke around 11pm. Soon the fire spread, gutting the electronics goods worth ₹90 lakhs, he said. He had started the business just a month ago.Fire officer Rajiv Kumar said seven fire tenders were pressed into service to douse the flames.In the first-ever audit held after the Surat coaching centre fire tragedy almost a year back, the Mohali fire department had found several safety violations in most commercial establishments in the district. The fire department even submitted a report to the concerned authorities and issued around 200 notices to commercial establishments in June 2019, but no action has been taken so far.

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||ROUNDABOUT No one embraces death the way you did: Kaifi Azmi||The year was 1964 and I was but nine when I heard my mother, aunts and older cousins talk in pained tones of the death of actor-filmmaker Guru Dutt, the rare talent who changed the landscape and mood of Hindi cinema even when he was making crime thrillers. Of course, his work of genius, Pyaasa, was rated one of the best 100 films of all times by Time Magazine. Yet at 39, after the box office failure of his autobiographical film Kagaz ke Phool, about the sad end of a great film director, he took his life with a deadly cocktail of alcohol and sleeping pills alone in his rented flat at Pedder Road as he and his wife had parted ways because of his fascination with his heroine Waheeda Rehman.The death left Mumbai of those days desolate as Guru Dutt was a much-loved person and artiste. It was poet Kaifi Azmi, lyricist of the famous Kagaz ke Phool song: Waqt ne kiya kya hasin sitam (time has done such charming injustice), who summed up his tragedy in a haunting ghazal that was on every lip in those sad times: Rehne ko sadaa dahar mein aata nahin koi, Tum jaise gaye aise bhi jaata nahin koi, Ik baar toh khud maut bhi ghabra gayi hogi, Yun maut ko seene se lagaata nahin koi! (No one comes to live on this earth forever, Yet no one goes the way you did, Even Death must have been taken aback, For no one embraces her the way you did).Season of sadnessIt was this ghazal by late Kaifi Azmi that was came to mind in this cruel month of June in the depressing days of Covid -9 when a young star, with everything going for him, chose to end his life. This is what popular actor Sushant Singh Rajput (34) did in his dream flat from where he looked out at the sea and watched the stars through a telescope. His suicide left his family friends and fans shocked by the intensity of his depression and loneliness in the cut-throat world of Mumbai films where an outsider, who is not from a film clan, is suspect and bullied. Here, talent is not seen as an asset but competition by many to be nipped in the bud.Saif Ali Khan who did a cameo role in Sushant’s yet to be released film Dil Bechara said thus of the young actor: “I think he had very refined looks. He was a good-looking guy. He was very talented, he was a little edgy… When I met him, I thought he was a little on the edge. And he was a little, I don’t know - I think he was looking for something. He was interested in the same things as me in some ways, like he liked astronomy, and he liked, you know, discussing some of this philosophy and talking about some stuff, which, you know, one dabbles in as an amateur.” Saif also described the outpouring of love by bigwigs of the cine game as ultimate hypocrisy, adding that silence would have been more appropriate.Copycat suicidesWhen a star adulated by many dies along with him die the dreams and aspirations of her/his admirers. There have been reports from different parts of the country including Nayagaon in the tricity of young fans killing themselves as they could not reconcile with their hero’s death. He leaves behind friends who will regret always that they missed his call and a love who will wonder for a long time of what could have been and of course a family shattered behind a stoic exterior.Commenting on the young following their hero to a sad end, psychiatrist Anirudh Kala says: “Copycat suicides are a known side effect of such callous media coverage of a celebrity’s death!” Indeed, regrets are many and those who lose someone they care for live with it for a lifetime. The mind goes back Guru Dutt and the sad lot of his immensely talented wife, singer Geeta Dutt, whose songs are alive even now and who became a victim of depression in the unhappy triangle, finally dying of cirrhosis of the liver.Some actors are more open about sharing their blues as Deepika Padukone did a few years ago and as Deepti Naval did many years ago. Bemoaning the loss of a talented actor like Sushant, Naval said: “The fight must go on, we have to fight the black wind with work!” So while bidding adieu to this young actor who made great strides in a year from teleserials to some of the best films, let’s remember him with love and think of his film Chhichhore, which had a strong message of struggling against all odds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/roundabout-no-one-embraces-death-the-way-you-did-kaifi-azmi/story-S1zmLFQfWBLZLzkMcwHujO.html

The rates would be applicable to all Covid-19 beds up to the upper limit of 60% of the total bed capacity of private hospitals. DDMA approved recommendations of High Level Expert Committee for fixing subsidised rates for Covid treatment in private hospitals Delhi.#IndiaFightsCoronaThe Delhi government had also said that beds for Covid-19 patients in private hospitals will be subsidised. “100 per cent Covid beds in private hospitals shall be subsidised up to upper limit of 60 per cent of total hospital capacity,” deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia had said in a tweet. केंद्र की समिति ने प्राइवेट अस्पतालों में 60% कोविड बेड्ज़ कम रेट पर सलाह दी थी. उससे बहुत कम बेड्ज़ कम दाम पर उपलब्ध हो रहे थे. अब 100% बेड्ज़ कम दाम पर उपलब्ध रहेंगे.

20-06-2020||City||Punjab to cap covid treatment cost in pvt hospitals||Chandigarh The Punjab government will cap the hospitalisation and treatment cost in private hospitals for Covid patients and those not adhering to it will be shut down, chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh said on Saturday.The rate for private hospitals and clinics is expected to be finalised by Monday, the CM said during his #AskCaptain session on Facebook.Taking strict view of complaints of exorbitant fee being charged by private hospitals, the CM termed such actions as ‘anti-people and anti-national’ and warned that the private institutions will not be allowed to indulge in such shameless profiteering at the cost of the lives of people. “If these hospitals do not agree to the government rates, we will close them down,” he added.Expressing concern over the spike in Covid cases in the state, the CM said he had sought from the Centre permission to allow the state to make Covid test certificates mandatory for all those crossing the border, adding that with 87,000 cars having entered Punjab from Delhi alone in recent days, the threat of the pandemic spiralling further was acute.Even as he reiterated the state’s full preparedness for handling the Covid crisis, with no shortage of equipment and supplies, the CM said the battle had to be fought collectively by all, while appealing to people to wear masks and maintain social distancing.For the first time, there had been an increase in the number of people on oxygen and ventilator, he said, adding that the situation was explosive, with cases rising around the world. With easing of restrictions and more testing, the numbers would continue to spike, he warned, adding that timely intervention and adherence to protocols was imperative to save lives.On a question regarding some industrialist wanting to bring back labourers to the state at their own expense, the CM said they were most welcome to do so but would need to ensure strict home quarantine for 14 days.On a concern expressed by a Hoshiarpur resident on sending students of a professional institute for exams to Jalandhar, the CM clarified that Jalandhar was no longer a containment zone and the state government was following a micro-containment strategy. Hence, there was no bar on students travelling to Jalandhar, except to the micro containment zones, to take their exam, he added.On the issue of Sikhs in Uttar Pradesh being relocated, Amarinder said he had spoken to his counterpart Yogi Adityanath and was hopeful that the latter will stop the move. “If that does not happen, he will take up the matter with the Prime Minister,” Capt said.Quote:Private institutions will not be allowed to indulge in such shameless profiteering at the cost of the lives of people.

20-06-2020||City||Tricity buzz: HT Chandigarh reporters’ tracker on all those making, or faking, news||Bow wow welcome at Chandigarh airportA pack of about 20 stray dogs have made the high-security Chandigarh International Airport their home. People landing from flights are greeted first by the canines and then their relatives as they walk out of the arrival gate. A security man deployed at the airport admits that the number of dogs went up during the two-month lockdown when the airport remained closed due to the Covid-19 pandemic. The airport was re-opened for domestic flights on May 25.MC employees see red over no space to parkWith the Chandigarh Municipal Corporation authorities denying them free parking in the city’s paid parking areas, MC employees are a disappointed lot. “It is for the first time that we have been denied this facility. There is hardly any parking space for employees within the MC office premises in Sector 17. Employees using cars are worst hit. Officers and councillors park their cars on the premises, leaving little space for employees. We will have to pay Rs 10 daily to use paid parking. Earlier, we would simply show our identity card and were allowed to park free of cost,” said an employee, requesting anonymity.Children playing without mask, parents fined Rs 500With Covid-19 cases on the rise in Panchkula, the district authorities are strictly implementing the guidelines and fining residents without mask in public places. However, residents of a society in Amravati Enclave in Panchkula were in for shock the other day when they were fined Rs 500 each after their children were found playing without masks.Showers catch weatherman unawaresWhen the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) forecast rain last week, there was none but this Friday, just the opposite happened. While the IMD predicted cloudy weather, everyone was in for a pleasant surprise as it rained heavily for almost an hour in the morning. After 23.4 mm of rainfall, the rest of the day went as per the weather man’s prediction and remained sunny and humid with the temperature climbing to 37.8 degrees Celsius by afternoon. The MeT office has forecast pre-monsoon showers next week. Hope it is on track this time.When UT health authorities leave journalists guessingWhen it comes to communicating the source of Covid-19 infection in the city, the UT health authorities have different yardsticks. For instance, when the probable source of infection in a case is outside Chandigarh, it gets mentioned in the medical bulletin. However, when the person testing positive has no contact and travel history, the UT health department does not mention the probable source, leaving journalists guessing. After the restriction on movement was lifted recently, there have been a number of cases from unaffected areas of the city.PU prepares to take exam next month, students in a fixThese are testing times. Panjab University is going ahead with preparations for conducting exams in July, but the confusion among students is increasing with each passing day. With Covid-19 cases on the rise, students are in a fix. The university plans to take the exams for the exit semester in July but students are wondering how it proposes to allot centres near their residences. It is learnt that the university will conduct the exams only after final directions from the government.Mehta or Anand? Schools have no idea who’s in chargeWho is the district education officer (DEO) of Chandigarh? Last week, the UT education department replaced Alka Mehta as DEO with Harbir Anand. However, the orders come into effect from July 1. But many school authorities are not aware about this vital detail. As a result, principals address Anand for every other issue when it’s Mehta who holds the charge.(Inputs by Hillary Victor, Munieshwer A Sagar, Shailee Dogra, Rajanbir Singh, Amanjeet Singh Salyal, Dar Ovais and Srishti Jaswal)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/tricity-buzz-ht-chandigarh-reporters-tracker-on-all-those-making-or-faking-news/story-K7US4OF68HGULLPZX4Mn2H.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||RANDOM FORAYS: Young achievers need care and counselling||Sushant Singh Rajput walked into my sarkari office twelve years ago accompanied by his brother-in-law, a senior colleague. A strapping young lad, with stars in his eyes and that inimitably unique playful smile upon his lips, he sat shyly as we sipped some coffee. He had been chaperoned into my ambit for the hour-long rendezvous to receive some career counselling which every 22-year-old inevitably needs. I advised him to give his acting dreams the full throttle and if success came his way, well and good. Otherwise there would still be time to change course.The fact that Sushant shone like a beacon on the precarious and dicey firmament of Bollywood is common knowledge. The fact that he was a philosopher at heart was little known but is now the stuff of a million social media posts. What ultimately led him to commit the unthinkable will perhaps never be known. What is certain is that young achievers like him need care and counselling along their journey.The sheer loneliness which comes from having scaled high peaks is perhaps the most telling factor of all. Even if friends and colleagues provide succour along the way, intermittently, such dazzling achievers ultimately have to ply a lonely course. And the glaring spotlight, coupled with oceans of adulation, necessarily make a young star live in a world all his own. It is implausible that one who achieves so much so rapidly and is the craze of millions can even think clearly, unless he makes a monumental effort to do so.A young Indian cricketer provides another case in point. Having debuted successfully for the country or even merely for an IPL team, the youngster will accrue a large fan base and humongous social media following, within no time. The media would begin hankering for interviews and people in malls would already be queuing up for selfies with the star. Fame and fortune would have sprung forth in gushes, seemingly from out of the blue.Hardik Pandya and KL Rahul, two of India’s most talented young cricketers, blundered majorly on Karan Johar’s widely watched show, when they made flippant, even pathetic, comments about the fairer sex. But then no one had apparently taught them the basics of handling the media or the manner in which to conduct themselves when on television. There have been several other instances when young players have erred while handling the public at large. And this, despite the fact that an Indian cricketer, whether male or female, actually represents a much more structured organisation, in this case, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI), than does a Bollywood actor. The same is true of sportspersons from other fields.Each young achiever, even a suddenly successful entrepreneur, finds it extremely tough to temper the razzle-dazzle of his success with gravitas and calmness. The tendency to succumb to the lure of bewitching distractions is a natural outcome for many. The enhanced frequency of moodiness and several spurts of anger could also afflict the young achiever in his early years unless he makes a determined effort to maintain his composure. Once he has attained a high goal, nothing short of those dizzying heights gives him satisfaction any more.Psychology Today magazine lists some indicators that can help others notice if young achievers have developed a ‘perfectionistic mindset’. These include the perceived need to top every exam as well as the tendency to consider themselves as failures if they ever find themselves placed even second or third in a ranking list. Severe depression and even suicidal tendencies have arisen in youngsters who constantly aspire for nothing less than numero-uno. They have not learnt to take the rough with the smooth.Even superstars with superhuman auras are, at the end of the day, normal human beings. They are liable to feel the same sense of anxiety and anguish that a common person will. Whether on top of the world or down in the dumps, they need people to talk to.Most people are in dire need of conversations, anyway. We, the people of the world, need to talk more and listen a lot more. And we need to stare at screens, a lot less.vivek.atray@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-forays-young-achievers-need-care-and-counselling/story-MCpfcrkN9gaIqSdYenb1iN.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Witerati: Parota powers doughs & don’ts of Lollita and Lalitaa reunion||As India Quarantining limped into a live-in with Unlock 1.0, #WorkFromHome too settled into its sequel script. Quite like the cast and crew of the “Housefull” franchise sauntering back to the sets with the same old faces, but new costumes or cosmetic changes.Cosmetic changes, yes, because a post-Lockdown narrative mirrors not just downsized vanities, but also downgraded vanity boxes. With the Mask as the new Half Burqa or Reverse Ghunghat, Unlock 1.0’s dilemma is: to do or not to do ... cosmetics. Of poor Parotas & Pricey atta-makers Interestingly, the sub-narrative of the Return of Bai - Lalitaas, Lajjos & Co – comes riding not just cosmetic changes, but also ego massages. And how! Remember the re-validation recently dished out to reinstated Lalitaas & Co? Re-validation One, by blokes bestowing tax slabs hard to swallow – 18 per cent GST on frozen food peculiarly spelt “Parota” (popular among us Punjabis as the more mouthful and ‘stuffed’ word “parantha”). Re-validation Two, courtesy curious contraptions called Atta Makers from brand Kent, whose promos got an unceremonious burial following a Twitter outcry about “classist’ and “casteist” content, cashing in on the Corona-induced phobia – to let or not to let dough be kneaded by maids, whose “hands may be infected”. The Lollita-Lalitaa reunion in “Houseful Returns” thus comes (em)powered by not just Unlock’s masked narrative, but also “unmasked” glee. Unmasked glee at Lalitaa & Co’s revalidation. Unmasked glee that, ironically, comes riding Death – of the Atta Maker, whose death-knell was scripted thanks to some chit of a copywriter who may have been more preoccupied presumably plodding through Netflix than political correctness whilst penning copy; and of the frozen “Parota” that was last heard gasping for breath under GST and is dying an untimely death upon the return of home-made Parotas rolling out from reinstated Bais.The curious case of Marie Antoinette’s “let them eat cake” facing stiff, oops “stuffed”, competition from frozen Parota.Of Merits & Multipurpose Masks What’s exciting is that New Normal’s mask may be manifesting multi-purposeness. Benefit One: The mask is to Social Distancing what filters are to Photoshopping and Instagramming.For one, the mask mercifully muffles the muttering of the Lalitaas from landing on the cochlear compartments of the Lollitas, when the former are chided for not practising social distancing even from the pets – Chihuahuas or Labradors – lolling around the living rooms of Lollitas, Lalits & Co.Cats can’t care two hoots for the migrant policy of NaMo, but care only for the fact that when they’re chasing mops ‘migrating’ from one room to the other they don’t like Lalitaas caterwauling “No Meow”. Social distancing be damned!Benefit Two: The Lalitaas now need to take a call – to remove or not to remove the mask whilst taking all those calls from their “gaon” or “homaro desh” that have the uncanny timing of landing bang in the middle of their labouring at Lollitas’ household chores. Pre-lockdown saw the Lalitaas spending ages on chattering, chopping knife in one hand and cellphone in the other – a Lalitaa meets Lasith moment – wherein Lalitaa looked like a Malinga undecided whether to bowl or bat. In those pre-masked narratives, the Lalitaas mouthed into their smartphones a smattering of Bihari or Bangla that the Lollitas could scarce decode, sounding as unintelligible as the ululations of the Chinese Premier, were he to call up Donald Trump minus a translator. Alas, now the mask makes this cross-country cellphone bonding during chores a Catch-22 crisis for the Lalitaas. Either the Lalitaas have to unmask, exposing themselves not only to viruses but also stares from Lollitas as frosty as the frozen Parota. (Remember, the Lollitas mayn’t be in the mood for interruptions in the rolling out of Parotas, since the generous GST on the frozen variants may have pushed up the consumption of Bai-prepared Parotas perceived as New Normal’s “forbidden fruit”).And if the Lalitaas don’t unmask, their masked mumblings to Malda or Midnapore may sound as muffled as Himesh Reshammiya rapping right through the throes of laryngitis.Advantage, Lollitas.The curious case of vanishing Atta Makers (em)powering the Revalidation of Bai.Of flawed narratives & face masks Masks, as New Normal’s Reverse Ghunghats and sartorial statements symbolising anonymous-isation and de-personalisation, may not spell well for the Khannajis and Khullarjis (K&Ks) of the neighbourhood. Remember, even pre-Lockdown, the Glad Eye of the Khanna jis and Khullar jis didn’t quite adhere to the #StayHome protocol and possessed the propensity to travel to Lollitas as much as Lalitaas lolling on neighbouring terraces. Post Lockdown 4.0, however, the K&Ks are facing tad tough time gazing at Unlock 1.0’s masked Bais plodding at pochaa-jharoo, swinging not just broomsticks but also their booty. Simply because their Glad Eye can’t make out whether behind the masks the recipient of their ogling is a Lollita, Lalitaa or Lata or ... Lava waiting to explode.The curious case of New Normal’s hottest occupational hazard – mistaken identity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/witerati-parota-powers-doughs-don-ts-of-lollita-and-lalitaa-reunion/story-8OzHo3vNNAPbSr3Uo5vNzH.html
20-06-2020||City||Corona battle: IVRI in the forefront, testing both human and animal samples||Lucknow: A week before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced lockdown across the country to fight Covid-19 outbreak, a meeting was hastily called at the Indian Veterinary Research Institute (IVRI) Bareilly to discuss testing, the most essential element in the fight against corona virus.“The meeting was called after we got the go ahead from director-general Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR) Trilochan Mohapatra to begin Covid-19 testing in our lab,” recalled RK Singh, director general, IVRI. The meeting ended briefly with directions to experts who were tasked to begin preparations for testing.Now three months later, the entire health infrastructure of Covid-19 management in districts of Rohilkhand region depends on tests done at IVRI. The deemed institute for veterinary sciences is one of the 33 designated testing centres in the state and the only place where Covid-19 samples of both animals and humans are tested. It is the only Covid-19 testing facility for Bareilly, Badaun, Pilibhit and other adjoining districts of the region.After making arrangements for sample handling, testing protocols and training the required staff, IVRI began testing on April 16. Only five samples were tested on the first day. At that time, the number of cases across the country was in double digit. “We have successfully tested 10761 samples of various district of the region till now. We are trying to test close to 300 samples every day. We have also tested 43 Covid-19 samples from wild animals,” said VK Gupta, joint director of Centre for Animal Disease Research and Diagnosis (CADRAD) at IVRI which is handling Covid-19 testing. Covid-19 is found to infect some species of wild animals who can act as its carrier. So the Institute is also testing samples of animals sent from various parts of the country.The Covid-19 testing for animals began on April 6 and so far 43 samples collected from tigers, leopards , lions, black bears, bats, monkeys, elephants, wild boars and bisons from Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Delhi have been tested. All these samples were found negative except that of a tiger and lion sent from Jaipur zoo. The results of both these samples are awaited.The testing of samples of both animals and humans is part of the push for the idea of ‘one health’ which believes that human and animal health is closely interlinked. The idea has been an integral part of IVRI since its inception. In 1889 when the Institute was established to look for cure of animal diseases, Dr Alfred Lingard, a physician, was made its first director. “Covid-19 pandemic has proved again that we need to work in the direction of one health,” said Singh. The institute has also begun research to develop a Covid-19 vaccine for animals and hopes that it may pave the way for human vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/corona-battle-ivri-in-the-forefront-testing-both-human-and-animal-samples/story-ou4IYD6vXm4fpvNugigaaO.html
20-06-2020||City||Zadoo brothers cremated, Jammu DC announces ₹2 lakh ex-gratia for kin||The mortal remains of Vimal Zadoo and Vipin Zadoo, the two Kashmiri Pandits who died at a cremation site near Tawi riverbed two days ago, were consigned to flames at Shastri Nagar here on Saturday.Vimal (38), a travel agent, is survived by his wife and two minor daughters, while Vipin (35) was unmarried, but had a 75-year-old father to look after.On Thursday, they had gone to cremate their 64-year-old uncle, who had died of Covid-19, in Sidhra area where they fainted and eventually died, allegedly due to the apathy of the officials present at the site, who didn’t even provide them water amid the scorching heat.Sub-divisional police officer (south) Ram Singh Charak said, “After pacifying the families, relatives and friends, the bodies were cremated at Shastri Nagar cremation ground. They demanded certain assurances like hike in compensation and change of the inquiry officer.”DIFFERENT ADC APPOINTED FOR PROBECharak informed that now ADC Tahir Firdous has been appointed to conduct the probe. The ADC also confirmed the same.Jammu district commissioner (DC) Sushma Chauhan had earlier appointed ADC law and order Ghanshyam Singh to conduct the magisterial probe. Singh was the one deputed for the cremation of the Covid-19 victim, during which the two men had died on Thursday.Sub-divisional magistrate (south) Shrikant Balasaheb Suse also visited the cremation ground and assured all possible help to the families.DC Chauhan has already ordered a time-bound magisterial probe into the Zadoo brothers’ deaths.On Saturday morning, the district administration announced an ex-gratia relief of ₹2 lakh each on humanitarian grounds to the next of kin of the deceased.PROTESTERS BLOCK HIGHWAYEarlier, protesters had blocked the Jammu-Pathankot highway in Gangyal, demanding a judicial probe into the two men’s death due to the alleged negligence of the district administration.“The death of our young men was the direct result of administration’s negligence. They were taken from place to place in search of a cremation site amid heat wave and were not even provided water,” said one of the protesters, claiming that they died of dehydration and it cannot be dismissed as a natural death and should instead be treated as “murder”.Another protestor said, “The administration now has announced ₹2 lakh each to get away with their murders. We demand judicial probe, suitable compensation and government job for their kin.”Senior BJP leader and former legislator Vikram Randhawa, who also joined the protest, said those responsible for failing to protect their lives should be taken to task.Local corporator Baldev Singh Billawaria said it is unfortunate that the administration has failed to identify a suitable place for the cremation of the Covid-19 victims till date despite witnessing unpleasant situations due to it in the past.Senior police and civil officers rushed to the scene and managed to clear the highway after a few several hours, officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/zadoo-brothers-cremated-jammu-dc-announces-2-lakh-ex-gratia-for-kin/story-9iDRTwZ5S9MpI9FjBvX2vL.html
20-06-2020||City||Thane, Kalyan civic schools uncertain on conducting online classes||While online education is possible for most private schools in the new academic year, the civic schools in Thane and Kalyan are still struggling to set up a system. While many civic school teachers in Thane are occupied with conducting Covid-19 surveys; the teachers in Kalyan are unable to reach out to the students as many belong to migrant families, and have left the city.“We cannot make online classes compulsory; hence we are ensuring that textbooks are made available to students so that they can prepare for the next academic year. Teachers are putting in efforts, but we are not able to reach out to all students,” said E Tadvi, education officer, Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC).In the current situation, many are unable to recharge their phone, while some do not have a compatible phone. “We are unable to trace all the students, however, we do send them weekly assignments on phone. Many students who do not have access to the internet are asked to do their revision through the week and share the answers with us on messaging platforms,” said a 45-year-old KDMC school teacher.Most teachers under Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) are occupied with Covid-19 health surveys. “Most of our teachers are busy with health surveys, so we have not made it compulsory for them to conduct classes. Some teachers who are conducting online classes, we have provided them with common online revision links,” said Rajesh Kankal, education officer, TMC. A few teachers from TMC have also received training for technology-driven teaching modules for the next academic year. However, the parents complain that they cannot afford internet services for their children. Hence, most of the students will miss out on academics this year.Sidhi Mahale, 32, parent of two boys, eight and 10 years old, studying in civic school at Lokmanya Nagar, Thane, said, “We are staying in a containment zone. Getting basic groceries has become difficult for us. We cannot pay for internet services and have only one smartphone in the family. It is difficult to teach the children in such circumstances.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-kalyan-civic-schools-uncertain-on-conducting-online-classes/story-V2muxfGHmlPgOwabplfkuM.html
20-06-2020||Mumbai||Cash and gutka worth ₹54 lakh seized in a raid||The Mumbai crime branch’s unit 6 recovered ₹49.15 lakh cash and seized gutka and tobacco products worth ₹5.53 lakh in a raid, on Saturday morning.The police arrested an accused, Rakesh Rajkumar Gupta, 28, a wholesaler supplier of gutka and tobacco products in Mankhurd and Govandi area for more than five years. Police said Gupta has six cases against him for selling banned gutka, said crime branch officer.Gutka is banned in Maharashtra, but the accused brought the products from Gujarat and sold them here at a higher price. The demand for the product was higher in Maharashtra during the lockdown. Gupta confessed that he kept the cash in the godown and wanted to send it to his native place, said Akbar Pathan, deputy commissioner of police, crime branch.“The consignment was brought in the truck that had a letter of carrying essential products,” said crime branch officer. The officers acted on a tip-off and laid a trap with FDA officials in Gandhinagar area, Mankhurd and conducted a search in Gupta’s godown. Gupta produced in court on Saturday and was sent to judicial custody. Police are investigating the main supplier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cash-and-gutka-worth-54-lakh-seized-in-a-raid/story-FAnC9jiSLAzWxkkSEtrxIN.html

20-06-2020||City||Jammu: 3 months on, district authorities yet to identify proper site for cremating Covid-19 victims||The district administration has failed to identify a proper cremation site for Covid-19 victims even after three months of the pandemic outbreak.The issue sparked public outrage in the district as two men died on Thursday due to heat and dehydration during the cremation of their relative, a Covid-19 victim, after they were made to shuttled for over two hours in an ambulance in search of suitable spot in the Tawi riverbed. The two cousins were cremated on Saturday at Shastri Nagar here.“Jammu district administration has utterly failed to identify a proper cremation site for covid victims. The death of two Kashmiri Pandit cousins is a serious lapse by the administration. Earlier, the family members of two Covid-19 victims were compelled by mobs to take away the dead, one of them half-burnt, to other places for cremation,” said Dr Mahesh Kaul, a prominent author.“The administration has indulged in genocide on the eve of World Refugee Day. PM Modi must intervene in the matter. It is a national shame,” he added.Senior journalist Mohit Kandhari wrote on his Facebook page, “Sitting inside their ivory towers, inside air conditioned offices, no bureaucrat can ever evaluate the cost of a human life, of a loved one. By announcing a sum of ₹2 lakh, the district authorities and J&K administration cannot walk free. They need to first identity the culprits who failed to discharge their duty and didn’t save precious lives.”Kandhari reminded the administration that under the “healing touch” policy of the Mufti government, the compensation to militants surrendering their arms and returning to mainstream was more than what the administration announced for the two KPs, who died of sheer negligence by the administration.On June 2, a mob had disrupted the cremation of a 72-year-old Covid-19 victim, while another in Domana had compelled a family to take the half-burnt body of their relative off the pyre. It was then cremated at Belicharana in Tawi river. ADC Ghanshyam Singh had then said, “The administration is already in the process of identifying land in three to four places for cremating Covid-19 vitims to avoid problems.”On May 14, kin of a former special bureau officer had to shuttle from pillar to post for his cremation in Jammu. He had also died of Covid-19. Administrative inertia coupled with resistance by locals led by two councillors of ward number 6 and 7 had aggravated the miseries of this family as it had to take the body back to the hospital mortuary from Jogi Gate cremation ground. The cremation was done at Shastri Nagar the next day.Jammu district commissioner didn’t respond to messages despite attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jammu-3-months-on-district-authorities-yet-to-identify-proper-site-for-cremating-covid-19-victims/story-1CJr3MIpU11L5Q5uSsSiMJ.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||WILDBUZZ: O! To be a wagtail, skipping stones on the blue Indus||As summer deepens in the tricity, many of our wonderful migratory birds disappear from our lives. Birds like the debonair Bar-headed goose or the proverbial golden girl, the Citrine wagtail, are no longer to be seen at the Sukhna lake and other wetlands. We wonder where our feathered friends have gone leaving us to the heat, sweat and dust of May and June. The wagtail, one of the prettiest of birds to observe, flies up to summer spots as enchanting as the Indus river marshes in Ladakh and beyond for breeding. From many parts of India starved of water and facing drought, the people there may wish to turn into wagtails in summer and fly to the blue waters of the Indus, settle there for a few months, skip on stones, chatter like schoolchildren on a picnic, and stare at the sheer abundance of water, the nectar of life! Such is the charmed life of the wagtail, whose breeding spots on the Indus in summer has been magically captured by a Spituk village-based birder, Choldan Gasha. The wagtail, like a happy dog, is prone to perpetually wagging its tail. While tourists have not flocked to Ladakh this summer due to Covid-19, Gasha reports that the Indus marshes near the Spituk Monastery not too far from Leh are hosting a larger number of wagtails as compared to last year. When wagtails winter in the tricity region, they are not seen in large flocks. But Gasha, who otherwise works for the civil supplies department, is fortunate enough to have seen flocks of 200 wagtails on the Indus. Just imagine the riot of golden feathers ducking and weaving across blue waters and against the backdrop of Ladakh’s matchless skies, whose beauty needs no photoshopping. To conclude this Ladakhi vignette, I turn to the description offered by the legendary birdman of India, Dr Salim Ali, of the Citrine wagtail: “Essentially a water wagtail, inseparable from marshland and grassy jheels. Numbers often seen on floating lotus leaves and vegetation on a tank, tripping along lightly in search of tiny insects, sometimes springing up into the air, and launching sprightly sallies in pursuit of escaping midges and other quarry.” No wonder, the sweet wagtail has been bestowed a dainty and aqueous vernacular name, Pani-ka-pilkya!KAMAL KA FOOLWalkers and tourists at the Sukhna lake would revel in the spectacle of brimming waters. But the regulator-end is besieged with the recurrent growth of lotus weed, which is spreading like an epidemic of chicken pox. The lotus has undertaken a further incursion to the rowing canal at the backwaters of the lake, which is earmarked as a migratory bird hotspot in winter and hosts the forest and wildlife department’s bird viewing post with binoculars, books and a spotting scope. But in recent winters, deep sheets of bird-less waters and galloping lotus is what the binoculars mostly pick up, much to the disappointment of avian lovers. The lotus shrivels up in winter leading to a round of self-congratulation in the UT engineering department, which hires the manual labour to prune the weed from the top. Since the weed is not uprooted, the lotus blooms and spreads with a vengeance with the onset of summer. Manual removal is merely an exercise in window-dressing though lakhs of rupees drawn unquestioned from the public exchequer are expended in the annual exercise to “remove” the weed. Manual de-weeding is currently underway at the Sukhna in continuance of the practise for the past several years. The lotus is not a favoured spot for most bird species as it tends to clog the wetland. Wetland birds are anyways missing at the Sukhna this summer because there are no shallow waters, marshes and sand banks for birds such as Black-winged stilts to breed. The lake seems a vast, solemn graveyard for bird life missing the cheery twitter. However, in those summers when the lake tends to dry up and silt is exposed harbouring enclaves of shallow water, the profusion of bird life is astounding. Most walkers, though, may pine for blank sheets of deep water! If the Sukhna is to play a gracious host to birds and afford walkers their daily dose of rippling sheets of aqua blue, the lotus must go from its root, forever.vjswild1@gmail.com||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/wildbuzz-o-to-be-a-wagtail-skipping-stones-on-the-blue-indus/story-oWY75cAgXmF04INYdCGWJP.html

20-06-2020||City||Kashmiri woman athlete alleges army harassment after exposing drug mafia, police refute claims||A young woman athlete has accused some Indian Army personnel of allegedly harassing her and her family after she took on the drug mafia in her hometown of Sopore in north Kashmir’s Baramulla district. However, army and police officials have refuted the allegations.Nighat Bashir, a national level karate player from Seelu Sopore, said that since the day she raised a voice against the drug mafia in Sopore, she has been facing a lot of problems.“When I heard that my brother is getting involved in drugs, I raised a voice against the drug mafia which also led to the arrest of one person. After that, the racket was busted by police in Sopore. But following the arrests, the army raided the area and assaulted my cousins saying they were looking for my father,” she alleged.The alleged incident had happened on the night of June 16.She alleged that an army major entered her home and harassed her brother-in-law because of his long beard. “When I raised a voice, the major threatened me saying that he will pump all his bullets into my body,” she said.“They ransacked our home and broke the almirahs. What mistake did I commit by raising a voice against drug peddlers? They told me they had orders to cordon off my home,” she alleged.“I want answers for why I was threatened. Is this the treatment one gets for representing India? When athletes are treated as such, what would be the fate of commoners,” she asked.She had also shared a video of her ransacked home and belongings on the social media.On Saturday, she alleged that she was again harassed by army personnel at Tappar Pattan when she was taking her brother to a hospital in Srinagar.“They harassed us and the officer concerned told me that whosoever goes against the Indian Army, would face the same fate. They have managed to restrict my accounts and I am not able to post anything,” she said.She complained of not feeling safe. “I appeal to the administration to provide protection to me and my family. We are facing trauma, and nobody is inquiring the matter. We want justice,” she demanded.The army has denied the allegations. “No army personnel is involved in ransacking or damaging any civilian property. These allegations are baseless,” said army spokesperson Rajesh Kalia.Sopore senior superintendent of police Javaid Iqbal said an FIR was registered against a drug addict Man Palla and six others on the complaint of Nighat Bashir’s family after her brother had sold a mobile phone to Palla in lieu of drugs.He said Nighat’s claims on social media that her cousins were beaten by the army and her house was cordoned off because she had raised a voice against drug peddlers were “not true”.“The searches were of general nature in Seelu and it was a joint operation by the army and police. Her home didn’t come under the search area, but one of her cousins’ did. Also, her cousin has refuted her claims in a video saying that he was not beaten,” he said.“Her allegations against an army major are also not true,” Iqbal said. “It seems she has some vested interest,” the SSP alleged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kashmiri-woman-athlete-alleges-army-harassment-after-exposing-drug-mafia-police-refute-claims/story-PJwGkfdhfsEpUODfEL2MLN.html
20-06-2020||City||Delhi: 50-yr-old stabbed, wife, son injured over vegetable cart parking||New Delhi: A 50-year-old man was stabbed and his wife and son were injured, allegedly by six men, during a quarrel over parking a vegetable cart in North Delhi’s Wazirpur Industrial Area Thursday night, the police said.Of the six suspects involved in the attack, the police have so far arrested two men, said Vijayanta Arya, deputy commissioner of police (north-west).The officer identified the victim as Ramesh Chand, his wife as Beena Devi and his son as Yuvraj. Ramesh earned his living by selling vegetables on a cart in the Wazirpur Industrial Area, where he lived with his family. Police said they suspect a family feud as the reason behind the incident. Ramesh’s step brother, 54-year-old Jaggu Chand, lived next door with his four sons. He too earned his living by selling goods off carts, said the police.“The two families had been quarrelling frequently over parking their carts outside their homes,” said the DCP.Around 11pm on Thursday, one of Jaggu’s sons returned home with his cart and parked it outside Ramesh’s house, the DCP said. “When Ramesh and his family objected to it, it again led to a quarrel,” said the DCP.While the elders of the families were trying to quell the matter, the younger ones allegedly assaulted each other. “A neighbour fighting from Jaggu’s side brought out a knife and soon, that party began stabbing Ramesh’s family,” said another police officer.In the assault, Ramesh, his wife and his son received severe stab wounds. They were first taken to a nearby police post on carts, before being rushed to the Babu Jagjivan Ram Hospital where Ramesh was declared brought dead.His wife and son too have suffered serious injuries, but they are expected to survive, said the officer.While Jaggu and his three sons remain on the run, Jaggu’s eldest son Abhishek and their neighbour Roshan, who allegedly brought out the knife, have been arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-50-yr-old-stabbed-wife-son-injured-over-vegetable-cart-parking/story-t2GtNg5tiZWzZMwlkPKM1I.html

20-06-2020||City||Delhi: Conmen who targeted the elderly arrested||New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Saturday said they have arrested three conmen who duped people, especially elderly persons or women, of their cash, jewellery and other valuables after entering their homes, either impersonating as police officers or their well-wishers.The alleged conmen would convince the victims that being their well-wishers they had come to alert them about raids at their house by different law enforcement agencies and help them shift the unaccounted money, jewellery, and costly valuables to a safer place from their houses, to avoid getting them seized by the raiding teams. They used to collect information about the names of the members of the family they planned to target from their neighbours, said senior police officers associated with the operation to arrest the suspects.In less than two months, the gang targeted more than two dozen families across the city and made away with cash, jewellery and valuables worth several lakhs of rupees. The gang’s kingpin, Lakhvinder Singh,25, has been previously involved in 17 similar fraud, robbery, burglary and other crimes, 16 of which were reported in Ghaziabad, Uttar Pradesh and another in west Delhi’s Naraina, said deputy commissioner of police (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.“While Lakhvinder operated on a white Apache motorcycle, which is commonly used by Delhi Police personnel, his two arrested accomplices – Sonu Kumar,38, and Sunny,38 – used to give him security cover in a Fortuner SUV or other cars. The Fortuner, a Honda Civic and Ertiga cars were seized along with the motorcycle, a fake police ID card, and stolen jewellery and R30,000 in cash were seized from them,” DCP Thakur said.DCP Thakur said that the on May 27, Lakhvinder duped a 70-year-old woman of cash and jewellery worth R5 lakh by entering her Chhattarpur Enclave home impersonating as a police officer and friend of her son. “Lakhvinder entered the house calling out the name of the woman’s son and daughter-in-law who had stepped out some minutes ago. He tricked the elderly woman into believing that a police team was coming to raid the house. He convinced her to put all the cash and jewellery in a bag and then fled with it,” said Thakur.Police had then registered a case. The DCP said that multiple investigating teams were formed to trace the suspects. The teams scanned CCTV footage and established the routes the suspects frequently used.“We found that the suspects used to park the motorcycle in the parking lot of Arjan Garh metro station after committing the crime. They further travelled toward Gurugram in the cars. We also installed a tracker device in the parked bike to trace its movements in case the suspects managed to slip,” said a police officer, associated with the probe.On Friday, Lakhvinder was caught when he came to the parking lot to get the bike for another crime. His interrogation led police to his two aides who were staying in a luxury hotel in Gurugram, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-conmen-who-targeted-the-elderly-arrested/story-5YBUSFWPieBXXkg5hm0FiP.html

Nearly 50 such cases, including that of Sidhu’s, have been pending since the 2019 LS polls.The case against Sidhu was lodged with Barsoi police station in Katihar on April 16, 2019, under sections of 123 (iii) (Concealing with intent to facilitate design to wage war) and 125 (Waging war against any Asiatic Power which is in alliance with the Government of India) of the Indian Penal Code.Separately, Bihar BJP vice-president Devesh Kumar had moved Election Commission against the cricketer-turned-politician.Sidhu has so far not been granted bail by the court of additional chief judicial magistrate in Katihar, which has been hearing the case.While campaigning for Congress candidate Tariq Anwar in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls, Sidhu had allegedly said, “Muslims should unite and vote in favour of Congress... If you people unite and vote unitedly, everything will overturn and Modi will be finished,” he had told a gathering while warning them not to vote for Asasuddin Owaisi’s party (AIMIM), which was also in the fray.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/4-days-on-bihar-cops-still-waiting-to-quiz-navjot-sidhu-in-amritsar/story-AU9b41fd9YHnch5bvDPHEN.html

Due to this, it is not at all safe to conduct census work by the staff of private schools, who may have to walk from door to door,” said the society’s president Saurabh Kapoor. Kapoor said because of the closure of schools and colleges for the past three months, parents did not deposit the fee even after the government order, and private schools have not been able to pay salaries to the staff. “If the order isn’t rolled back, teachers might resign out of fear,” he said. District education officer Uma Sharma said details will be submitted as required, and that no school or teacher had approached the departments with any concerns. The deputy commissioner couldn’t be reached for a comment despite calls and text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/census-work-ambala-admn-private-schools-at-loggerheads/story-eDJfr1kghX596SovCXonVM.html

The meeting was held after the state government and the L-G failed to agree on the issue during their meeting in the afternoon.“Regarding institutional isolation, only those COVID positive cases which do not require hospitalisation on clinical assessment & do not have adequate facilities for home isolation would be required to undergo institutional isolation,” Baijal tweeted after the meeting. The chief minister’s office also confirmed the development. During the day, news agency ANI quoted union minister of state for home affairs G Kishen Reddy saying that he expected a new order by evening.“Delhi L-G might have ordered institutional quarantine for the benefit of those who do not have space in their homes. But I think that he will issue another piece of information by today evening for people who can create an isolated separate room in their homes,” Reddy was quoted as sayingThe Delhi Disaster Management Authority, headed by Baijal, had said in its earlier order that it fears “home isolation without physical contact to monitor the patients may be a reason for the increase in the spread of Covid-19 infections in Delhi”.An official who was part of Saturday’s meeting between Baijal and Kejriwal, confirmed that chief minister Kejriwal said that if Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is allowing home-isolation for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases across the country, “why were different rules being implemented in Delhi?”The chief minister is learnt to have told the L-G that people would avoid getting tested for the disease fearing they would be sent off to an institutional quarantine facility for five days.The officials also said that Kejriwal mentioned the shortage of health care staff and the difficulties in getting doctors and nurses at such a short notice for thousands of patients at the quarantine centres.AAP MLA Raghav Chadha too had opposed the order. He told reporters in the morning, “We had estimated that we would need 15,000 beds by June 30. However, following this order, we would need 90,000 beds in Delhi by that time. How are we going to arrange for so many beds?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/compulsory-5-day-institutional-quarantine-order-for-all-covid-19-cases-in-delhi-withdrawn/story-bBTTCOyEEHcBxZik3cMtEM.html

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Suicide cases jump by 60% in Himachal during lockdown||A 36-year-old debt-ridden shopkeeper committed suicide by hanging himself in Kullu district on Thursday. He had incurred losses as his cloth shop in Bhuntar had been closed due to the Covid-19 lockdown. It is learnt that he was unable to repay the loan taken from banks and individuals, which led him to take the extreme step.On Friday, a school superintendent committed suicide at his workplace in Shimla. Though the reason behind his ending his life is still being ascertained, depression during the lockdown is emerging as a concern.In April and May this year, 122 people have committed suicide in Himachal Pradesh due to various reasons, according to police records.This is a spike of 60% in the monthly average.A total of 115 suicide cases were reported in the hill state from January 1 to March 31 before coronavirus pandemic struck. This year’s total tally of suicides till May 31 was 237.Data shows that on an average 38 people committed suicide every month during the first quarter. However, the average saw a jump of 61 suicides a month in April and May.Police sources said that most of the victims were youngsters. Some had lost their jobs or businesses or were in emotional distress.MORE CASES IN MAY THAN IN APRILWith 81 cases, suicide incidents were almost double in May compared to 41 in April when the lockdown was harsher. Seventy-five of the victims were male and 41 female.Mandi district recorded a maximum 23 cases, followed by 21 in Kangra; Una 18; Sirmaur 14; Shimla 13; Solan 10; six each in Bilaspur and Kullu; Hamirpur five; three each in Chamba and Kinnaur.No suicide was reported in Lahaul-Spiti district.‘SHRINKING SOCIAL CIRCLE AMONG CAUSES’Assistant director, Regional Forensic Science Laboratory (RFSL), Dharamshala, Dr Surender Kumar Pal said that the peculiar situation of the lockdown may have weighed heavy on the psychology of people.The fear of coronavirus and stress due to job and business losses may be the reason behind the increased suicide cases, he says.“The shrinking social circle due to distancing guidelines is another reason. Besides, during the lockdown, domestic conflicts increased,” said Dr Pal.GOVT TO ASCERTAIN REASON: CMWhen asked, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said that it was hard to ascertain if the suicides were the result of lockdown woes. “Still, the government will ascertain the reasons in these cases,” he said.Thakur said that the government has launched schemes to provide employment to those who returned to the state due to job loss amid the lockdown.Besides, we have also asked banks to defer loan instalments to provide relief to the traders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/suicide-cases-jump-by-60-in-himachal-during-lockdown/story-BSLho4iAor89P5dwa1mM8H.html

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Need of the times must be incorporated in education system: Sonam Wangchuk||Sonam Wangchuk, the man who inspired Vidhu Vinod Chopra’s 3 Idiots spoke at Chitkara University’s Explore series on Saturday. Wangchuk, an academician, education reformist and founder and advisor for SECMOL (Students’ Educational and Cultural Movement of Ladakh ) spoke about the ‘economics of giving’ in his live session with students at Chitkara University.Wangchuk said that any education system must address to the real needs of time: “If our country and planet is facing a challenge due to industrial production then we should change what we teach our children,” he said.“We need to start talking about healing the planet rather than fuelling its destruction and the need of the time must be incorporated in the education system,” he said. Asked about his take on innovation, Wangchuk said, “Most of the innovation that we see around us these days does not take local factors and India-specific solutions into consideration. For instance, we see glass buildings in Delhi inspired by the architecture of western cities with sub-zero temperatures. This type of architecture helps keep those places warm but the same architecture in Indians cities like Delhi that are already hot leads to increased use of air conditioning causing increased electricity bills and health and environment issues.”On his recent views on the boycott China movement, Wangchuk said, “More products should be manufactured locally, which will generate employment and gradually wean off Indians’ addiction and dependency on Chinese goods and products. The world is looking forward to exploring India for setting up big ventures. We must build our capacities.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/need-of-the-times-must-be-incorporated-in-education-system-sonam-wangchuk/story-RMg1zIuCq3iSBjKcLd04RI.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Judge cites ’70s Bollywood hit Bobby to express concern over failing love marriages||Chandigarh: All is fair in love and war but judges of the Punjab and Haryana high court beg to differ.In the past week, two judges have expressed concern over the rise in the number of love marriages falling apart these days and the high court being burdened by such cases that can otherwise be dealt by subordinate judiciary.While granting bail to a youngster from Yamunanagar who faces kidnap charges and offence of exploitation under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, the bench of justice Arun Monga even cited the example of the ’70s Bollywood hit, Bobby, starring Rishi Kapoor and Dimple Kapadia, to drive home its point.The judge observed that runaway couples are falling out even before falling in love. “Adolescents take a liking for each other, resulting in affection beyond social limits. Next starts their scheming for a fairytale dreamland. But real life is different from reel. When the happy ending is not the script, the same intimacy and affection turns into hostility,” he said.‘DEMEANING CHILDLIKE WORK’His observations come close on the heels of another high court judge, justice RN Raina, suggesting an alternative mechanism be evolved to hear petitions of runaway couples seeking protection.He termed the task of hearing pleas for protection to such couples as “the most demeaning childlike work” high court judges have been entrusted with. “This work should be given to the subordinate judiciary,” the judge suggested. Even during the Covid-19 lockdown, the high court took up between 30 and 40 such petitions. Lawyers admit that the number of such petitions goes beyond 100 on normal days.Justice Monga said that daily, the court hears bail petitions by youngsters on their so-called love turning sour with allegations of rape or on the other hand while still in their wedding gear, couples seek protection for fear of being hounded by hostile family members.PARENTAL PRESSUREThe court granted bail to the Yamunanagar youngster as it prime facie appeared to be a case of teenaged love not meeting the approval of the 17-year-old girl’s parents. The case was registered on the complaint of the girl’s parents.The youngster told the court that they were in love and the fact is established from the statement he gave to a judicial officer that the girl had willingly married him. The girl declined to undergo medico-legal examination, stating no wrong was committed and whatever happened was with her consent. The government counsel said the claims are as per the probe records.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/judge-cites-70s-bollywood-hit-bobby-to-express-concern-over-failing-love-marriages/story-DZj2cqquRo4DA3sPfpUfLN.html
20-06-2020||Delhi||Leaves of Delhi govt hospital employees cancelled as Covid cases rise||The Delhi government’s health department has directed all hospitals and medical institutions under it to recall their employees, who are currently on leave, and report for duty immediately. The order was issued by the special secretary of the health department, SM Ali on Friday. The official in his order said that leave of any kind would only be granted under “most compelling circumstances”.A shortage of staff in the hospitals was reported as one of the main reasons by the medical directors of bigger Delhi government hospitals for their inability to expand intensive care unit services for Covid-19 patients. To combat the challenges in the hospitals, the government on Thursday ordered that the final year student pursuing their MD/MS/ DNB (post graduate medical training) and final year students of undergraduate and post graduate nursing would be hired for the next six months.The shortage of staff is likely to be more acute if the five-day institutional isolation is mandated for everybody who tests positive, including those with mild or no symptoms of the infection.Currently, at least 10,000 patients are under home isolation in the city.Earlier this week, the health department had also issued another order, which stated that action would be taken against health department staff not reporting to work. Only those who had tested positive for Covid-19 were allowed to remain in home isolation. This came at a time when the city’s health minister tested positive for the infection. Prior to this order, the director general of health services also had to undergo quarantine for fever.Until Thursday night, Delhi recorded 53116 Covid-19 cases. At least 2035 have died of the coronavirus disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/leaves-of-delhi-govt-hospital-employees-cancelled-as-covid-cases-rise/story-hyUQknGezXtbRmAaH5Uw6I.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Civil hospital medical staff goes on strike to protest sacking of 22 surplus lab technicians in Amritsar||Medical staff at Jallianwala Bagh Martyrs Memorial Civil Hospital, Amritsar, went on an indefinite strike on Saturday to protest against the state government’s move of sacking 22 surplus lab technicians.Patients were left in a lurch as health services, including the outpatient department (OPD), emergency department and Covid-19 related services, were affected as around 300 doctors, nurses, para-medical staff and lab technicians, staged a protest at the hospital and raised slogans against the government and health department.Punjab health and family welfare department additional chief secretary Anurag Agarwal on Friday issued a notice to the civil surgeon and said that there were around 27 lab technicians working at the district hospital against the sanctioned five posts.“I had requested the hospital to rationalise and send the surplus lab technicians to their respective postings on multiple occasions but they continued to work at the Amritsar civil hospital. Almost all surplus lab technicians were influential and had got the posts unfairly,” he said. Employees’ Welfare Association chairperson Rakesh Sharma said, “All the lab technicians were working as frontline warriors during the Covid-19 outbreak as assigned by the civil surgeon and the health department. The government, which had hired them and was using their services in the management of the hospital, has now sacked them illegally. Instead of sacking them, the government should have posted them at other hospitals or health care centres.”‘ROLL BACK TERMINATION ORDERS’Association president Deepak Devgan said, “The hospital, which runs 24x7 and has a high footfall, cannot function smoothly with just five lab technicians. Also, the lab technicians had been told to collect swab samples from suspected Covid-19 patients and they performed their duties well. The government must roll back its termination orders.” The protesters said Covid-related duties and emergency duties will re-start from Saturday evening but OPD and other services will remain suspended till their demands were met. “A written request asking the authorities to roll back the orders has been submitted to the civil surgeon and he has assured us that he will take up the matter with ministers”, they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/civil-hospital-medical-staff-goes-on-strike-to-protest-sacking-of-22-surplus-lab-technicians-in-amritsar/story-vFRlwKTVnaTPELA7pr0l8N.html

20-06-2020||Ranchi||Jharkhand moves SC against Centre’s decision to auction coal blocks for commercial mining||The Jharkhand government has moved the Supreme Court challenging the Central government’s decision to unveil the process for the virtual auction of coal blocks for commercial mining.Jharkhand Advocate General Rajiv Ranjan said that the state government moved a writ petition in the apex court on Friday contending that the decision to auction the coal blocks, some of which are in Jharkhand, will not benefit the state in the prevailing Covid-19 pandemic.The state will incur a loss as it would not fetch the market price, says the plea, according to Ranjan. He said that a proper assessment related to the adverse impact on a huge tribal population and forests has not been done and added that a detailed study covering all aspects of the decision is required.Earlier this week, Prime Minister Modi had launched the auction of 41 coal mines for commercial mining and reiterated his call for India to become self-reliant in energy by reducing imports.This comes as despite having the world’s fourth-largest coal reserves and being the second-largest producer, the country is the second-largest importer of coal.The rollout of commercial coal mining is part of the series of announcements made by the Centre under the Atmanirbhar Bharat Abhiyan. It is expected to boost private sector participation which will, in turn, lead to higher production and enhance competition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/jharkhand-moves-sc-against-centre-s-decision-to-auction-coal-blocks-for-commercial-mining/story-lK1ljWZYtFboJAKiDV2i6I.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana farmers struggle to sow paddy in absence of farm labourers||Farmers are struggling to sow paddy in the absence of migrant labourers who had returned to their native places amid the coronavirus pandemic.Farmers said the cost of labour had increased from Rs 2,200 to Rs 4,000 per acre. They say labourers are also demanding free meals and advance payment as migrant labourers from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand had returned to their native places after the Central government had imposed a nationwide lockdown to contain the coronavirus.FARMERS REACH OUT TO UP-BASED CONTRACTOR A farmer, Jaibir Singh of Rohtak’s Karor village, said, “Four of us enlisted a contractor in western Uttar Pradesh. He asked us to provide transportation facility for the labourers. We brought eight labourers in two cars to our village. We are providing three meals a day, accommodation and Rs 4,000 to each labourer,” he said.The state government is encouraging paddy farmers to shift maize and pulse cultivation under the ambitious Mera Pani Meri Virasat scheme but most farmers are unwilling to sow other crops. Under this scheme, farmers switching over to an alternate crop instead of paddy this season will be given an incentive of Rs 7,000 per acre. Farmers of 19 blocks where water the depth is around 40 metres are included in this scheme.A farmer from Sonepat’s Bhainswal village, Vijay Pal, said his fields were ready for sowing paddy but he had been unable to find labour.“Most local labourers are already engaged in construction and paddy plantation activities and the migrant workers are unwilling to return. The absence of migrant workers has hit us hard. Contractors are demanding Rs 15,000 for bringing labour from Uttar Pradesh along with Rs 4,200 per acre for paddy sowing and free meals for workers,” Pal said.LOCAL LABOURERS IN DEMAND Local labourers in villages of Rohtak , Jhajjar and Sonepat say they were employed in the absence of migrant labourers.Sakuntla Devi, a labourer from Jhajjar’s Dighal village, said she was glad to have found work in her village.“This time farmers are preferring local labourers. We are being paid Rs 4,100 to Rs 4,300 per acre for paddy sowing in advance. This time we will not have to leave the village to earn money”, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-struggle-to-sow-paddy-in-absence-of-farm-labourers/story-f95HjaKR5ottR0QRdwJq3K.html
20-06-2020||Delhi||Take action against private hospital if found to have derogated in its duty: Delhi HC||NeThe Delhi High Court has directed the Delhi government to carry out an investigation against the Primus Super Speciality Hospital after hearing a petition alleging serious carelessness by the hospital in the treatment of a patient.A bench of Justice Navin Chawla, after hearing the petition, observed that the allegations made by the petitioner against Primus Super Speciality Hospital in Chankyapuri are of a grave nature.“The Delhi government is directed to carry out an investigation into the same and in case the hospital is found to have derogated in its duty in any manner, take appropriate action in this regard,” the bench said in its order on Friday.The court, however, clarified that it has not expressed any opinion on the allegations.The plea was moved by Prem Singh, whose wife died due to Covid-19 on June 14. His 34-year-old daughter, who is 85 per cent permanently disabled, also started suffering from fever and breathlessness and as her condition aggravated, she was admitted to the Primus Super Speciality Hospital on June 18.“It was suspected that the daughter was also suffering from Covid-19 virus but the hospital did not carry out any test on her and in fact, taking an excuse that there was non-availability of beds, asked the petitioner to shift her to another hospital,” the plea said.“In fact, she was almost thrown out of the hospital. It is submitted that this was in spite of the fact that the website of the Delhi Government shows the availability of the beds in the said hospital for the Covid-19 patients,” it added.It said that after the filing of the present petition, the petitioner has been able to secure the admission of his daughter to Max Super Speciality Hospital, Saket, New Delhi.Advocate Hemant Gulati, for the petitioner, submitted that though the daughter of the petitioner has been admitted to another hospital, it is yet to carry out the tests of the petitioner and his son as they had also come into the contact of the wife and daughter.It is apprehended that they may have also contacted the Covid-19 virus, the plea said.Advocate Anjum Javed, counsel for the Delhi government, had submitted that he will request the authority concerned to immediately carry out the tests of the petitioner and also his son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/take-action-against-private-hospital-if-found-to-have-derogated-in-its-duty-delhi-hc/story-azCrJDjau0TJ231eM83mkK.html

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Indian-American philanthropist to donate 1 million US dollars worth of face masks to protesters in US||On the occasion of Juneteenth, eminent Indian-American philanthropist and entrepreneur Gurinder Singh Khalsa has announced to donate face masks and protective shields worth USD 1 million to peaceful demonstrators across the US seeking protection from police brutality and demanding police reform after the death of African-American George Floyd.Juneteenth celebrates the emancipation of those who had been enslaved in the US.Indiana-based Khalsa, a recipient of the prestigious Rosa Parks Trailblazer Award, also said that we need to portray the true picture of America if we want to replace hate and violence with love and compassion.Khalsa, who is also the founder of SikhsPAC, a nonpartisan political action committee, said that his USD 1 million worth donation of face masks and protective shields to the protestors nationwide is a small token of contribution to those who are seeking justice and end to the police brutality, reflected in the recent gruesome murder of 46-year-old Floyd in Minneapolis last month.Khalsa recently started Cleanxa, a personal protection equipment manufacturer and distributor, which would be used to distribute reusable, rewash able, medical grade filtered face masks and protective shields to protestors either individually or in bulk through non-profit bodies.Noting that he took this decision to commemorate Juneteenth to support national movement seeking police reforms, Khalsa requests every American to join this movement by following the path of peaceful protest shown by leaders like Martin Luther King Jr and Mahatma Gandhi.‘LEARN LESSONS FROM HISTORY’“Going forward if we want to replace hate and violence with love and compassion, we need to portray the true picture of American history. This is the most important part of American history, which is not being taught in schools. For the better future of America, we need to learn our lessons from history, however bitter it might be,” he said.‘STILL A LONG WAY FROM EQUALITY’ Observing that he was inspired by two movies that he recently watched “Just Mercy” and “13th” and the series “Hell on Wheels”, Khalsa said that people of this great country still have a long way to go to achieve the goals of equality and equity set up by its founding fathers.Amidst the COVID-19 pandemic in the country, widespread protests have been taking place for weeks across the US following the death of Floyd in Minneapolis while he was in police custody. Protesters have sparred with police for weeks.The US continues to remain the worst-hit country from the novel coronavirus with 2,191,052 cases and 118,434 deaths.“SikhsPAC has always and will always stand with the Black community. SikhsPAC is making these donations as a way to advocate for police reform and justice for Black individuals in the United States. Along with this, SikhsPAC would like these donations to reflect their support for making Juneteenth a national holiday,” Khalsa said.“In this country, the atrocities against Black individuals are not covered enough within the history lessons taught to our children in schools,” he rued.“Putting a blanket over the history of systematic racism in our country is one of the most harmful things we can do – the new generations moving forward will be much more passionate, caring, and understanding towards their Black community members if they are taught the real, tough history,” Khalsa said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/indian-american-philanthropist-to-donate-1-million-us-dollars-worth-of-face-masks-to-protestors-in-us/story-pcEOdhhMTT1YhjJO8ZSZNP.html

Saurabh Bhardwaj, a member of the legislative assembly (MLA) of the ruling Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) from the Greater Kailash constituency in south Delhi, also tweeted that the order was impractical and cited a lack of adequate institutional quarantine facilities for all Covid-19 patients.Another AAP MLA from Rajinder Nagar, Raghav Chadha, also opposed the L-G’s move on the ground that the national capital would require at least 90,000 hospital beds by end-June, if the order has to be followed. However, the Arvind Kejriwal-led government had made arrangements for only 15,000 hospital beds till end-June, he told media persons.“How are we going to arrange so many hospital beds in such a short span of time?” he asked.The L-G’s office is yet to clarify if the new order would be applicable to around 10,000 people, who are already quarantined at home, or only those who test Covid-19 positive from Saturday onwards, or for both the categories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhi-govt-opposes-l-g-s-order-on-mandatory-institutional-quarantine-for-covid-19-patients/story-i3mbMb6w2vhkzn3E3bu9bO.html

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Himachal Pradesh CM takes stock of situation along China border, villages not to be vacated for now||Shimla: The Himachal Pradesh government does not plan to get the six villages within 10 km of the border with China evacuated for now but it has stepped up vigil in the area after the recent faceoff between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh that claimed the lives of 20 soldiers.Chief minister Jai Ram Thakur reviewed the situation in the state’s regions along the China border in tribal Lahaul and Spiti and Kinnaur districts. Thakur, who also holds the state home portfolio, met Himachal director general of police Sanjay Kundu and the Indo Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) commandant besides central intelligence officials at Oakover, his official residence in Shimla, to take stock of operational preparedness on Friday.Thakur had cancelled his visit to the frontier areas in the first week of June due to the standoff in Ladakh. He was to visit Sumdoh, a strategic post between Lahaul and Spiti and Kinnaur, which is a military base. Himachal Pradesh shares a 260-km border with China in Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti districts.During the review meeting, it was decided that villages along the border will not be evacuated for now.BORDER VILLAGERS WORRIEDVillagers have been worried due to escalating tensions between the two countries. Namgia, Pooh, Tashigang, Sumdoh, Shalkar, and Dubling villages are located within 10km of the border.Both India and China have deployed more units in the frontier areas after the face-off. China deployed more troops in Tunzuk and Shipki La, the main centre for the annual cross-border trade. The pass connects Kinnaur district with the Tibetan Autonomous Region.The trade with China that begins in mid-June is held up this year due to the Covid-19 pandemic and the border tension in Ladakh and Sikkim.KEEPING A WATCHMeanwhile, DGP Kundu has asked superintendents of police in Kinnaur and Lahaul and Spiti districts to monitor the situation in border villages. “Both the district police chiefs have been directed to meet inhabitants of border districts,” Kundu said.Police have also been asked to guard against rumour-mongering on social media. Though the region remained largely peaceful during the 1962 aggression, the ITBP representative briefed the chief minister about activities of the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) across the border. There is no suspicious activity along the border, he said. ONLY TWO PASSES OPENOf the nine mountain passes in Himachal Pradesh on the border with China that forbids troops from both countries to intrude into each other’s territory, only two, namely Lepcha La and Shipki La, are open.

20-06-2020||Education||Patna University to hold pending BA exam on July 21; PUSU dissatisfied||The long-awaited final exam of BA part III of Patna University (PU) will be held on July 21. The university had deferred all the exams following the outbreak of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the state.The exam was scheduled to be held on March 13 across six centres, but it was put off later, holding the fate of around 3,000 students in a balance.PU’s examination controller RK Mandal said that elaborate arrangements were being made for peaceful and fair conduct of the examination, for which the students were waiting anxiously for the past three months.The examination will be conducted at Patna Women’s College, Magadh Mahila College, Patna College, Patna Science College, BN College and Vanijya Mahavidyalaya of the PU. Additional exam halls would be engaged to conduct the examination in conformity to the social distancing norms.NK Jha, dean of students’ welfare, said that the principals of various constituent colleges have been urged to provide list of total capacity for accommodating students. “College premises would be sanitised before exam and students would have to wear mask,” Jha said.Talking about the status of copy evaluation of exams held prior to suspension of academic activities owing Covid-19 outbreak, Jha said that result of B.com is expected to be declared in 10 days.He said, “Of the three traditional UG courses, examination of commerce stream was duly completed as per previous schedule. Evaluation of copies has been completed and results are expected in 10 days. Besides, copy evaluation of those exams of Arts stream which were held earlier is also almost complete. Practical exams of science stream are yet to be conducted by respective colleges.”“We are trying to complete pending exams and release results of final year students at the earliest so that they can apply in PG courses”, added Jha.PU is likely to conduct rest pending exams of traditional, vocational and diploma courses in July-end and August.However, Patna University Students’ Union is not satisfied with the decision. Nishant Kumar, vice-president of PUSU, said, “Students are not ready for exam as they are under mental stress and one-month study leave is not sufficient to prepare for exams. Besides, students residing in hostels have returned to their native places. Gathering of students from different corners would risk health of students. We’d sit on a hunger strike seeking postponement of part III examination and promotion of part I and part II students without examination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/patna-university-to-hold-pending-ba-exam-on-july-21-pusu-dissatisfied/story-urhhgKvZ6v9kiBgEHmuMZO.html
20-06-2020||Lucknow||Iconic Tunday Kababi reopens after 90 days||After a lull, the iconic eatery Lucknow’s Tunday Kababi is back. Mohammed Usman, the owner, said they have re-opened after more than 90-days. “We are presently serving mutton and chicken galaouti kebabs. However, we are yet bring back buffalo meat kebabs (considered to be the most popular dish) to the menu since shops selling the meat are still closed.”The eatery, popular for its Awadhi cuisine, was established by Usman’s grandfather in 1905. The business was hit by the 68-day lockdown that began on March 25 to contain Covid-19, licencing issues and disruptions in meat supplies. “It was the first time in the restaurant’s 115-year history that we had to suspend operations during holy month of Ramzan in April,“ he said.Relishing the galaouti kebabs would now be a little dearer to the food lovers since the eatery has raised prices. “We are selling mutton kebabs for ₹100 a plate and ₹80 for chicken galaouti kebabs,” said Usman. Initially, a plate of mutton kebabs used to cost for ₹84 whereas buffalo kebabs, which were the most popular, used to cost ₹50 a plate.“Good things come at a price. I don’t mind spending a little extra on one of my favourites kebabs. I think things are gradually coming back on track after lockdown,” said Bilal Arshad, a patron.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/iconic-tunday-kababi-reopens-after-90-days/story-GJKLn7gSvZwImNSgAxBojN.html

20-06-2020||Delhi||Delhiwale: The father of six daughters||He is thousands of miles away from home, and tends to keep his troubles to himself instead of adding anxieties to his family. For instance, when he accidentally hurt his left foot a few weeks ago while riding his rickshaw (despite the coronavirus-triggered lockdown), Rajinder didn’t utter a word about the “mild pain” to his wife, who lives in faraway Kolkata.Anyways, he does not have easy means to reach out to her.“I have no mobile,” he says, rolling up his expressive eyes. They look so full of life and motion that they could be a separate person altogether.Rajinder is perched on the passenger seat of his rickshaw in a central Delhi market lane. He’s waiting for customers. It is still early in the morning.In his late 40s, he is wearing a T-shirt and check shorts “that I bought before the lockdown.” He points out that he will get a new set of daily wear only after wearing out the present one.The rickshaw puller has no fixed address in the city, though he has been living here for 17 years. He sleeps in a nearby Ren Basera, a shelter for the homeless.“Why spend money on room rent when I’m alone here,” he argues, taking out an orange mask tucked away within the secret crevices of his rickshaw’s roof. Tying it with a practised ease about his face, he explains that he came so far from his own city to better support his large family. “I have six daughters and no son, so I have to work doubly hard.” He admits Kolkata itself is a bustling metropolis with a variety of work options “but in Delhi you make more money... and you must remember I have six daughters.”On request. Rajinder lists their names, and utters them out in a single breath as if chanting a mantra: “Pooja, Rupa, Tanu, Soni, Bipasha, Natasha.”He mentions that his wife’s name is Champa Devi.Rajinder now shows the hurt foot. For a better view, he places it on the rider’s padded seat and leisurely rubs his fingers over the heel. There are no scars. Every night at the shelter he massages his affected foot with “mom ki tel.”While chatting, he admits candidly that he would sometimes be out on the streets with his rickshaw during the lockdown. “I’m sorry to have broken the rules... I would be finished with money, and forced to find a few rides.” Otherwise, he says, he would spend those days cooped up inside the homeless shelter.Now he asks for his interlocutor’s mobile phone. “I try to talk to my wife by borrowing phone from customers or (friendly) shopkeepers... they always give it for me to make a brief call.”The person on the other end picks up the phone almost at once, and Rajinder chats for a minute in an accent that is difficult to comprehend.A short while later, he gets the day’s first customers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/delhiwale-the-father-of-six-daughters/story-2rx4ZzPpjtvSBim9MOoZpJ.html

20-06-2020||Chandigarh||50-minute rain exposes chinks in Chandigarh’s drainage system||The 23.4mm rain over 50 minutes on Friday morning, which caused waterlogging in a number of important roads in the city, was an indication of how ill-prepared the city is for the monsoon, expected to hit by the end of this month or early July.“The road outside the HIG complex had been filled with debris from construction done a few years back which has blocked the road gullies here, so even a little rain leads to waterlogging,” complained Amardeep Singh, president, Sector 39-B resident welfare association (RWA).The northern sectors, too, had a similar problem. “The gullies are in bad shape and are not being cleaned properly. Instead of the covers being taken off and the gullies cleaned from inside, jut the covers are scraped,” said Ranvinder Singh Gill, president, Sector 8 RWA.Friday’s rain led to waterlogging in two drains outside his house, he said.The inner sector road in Sector 19 was also flooded. “There are many old trees over here and the roots have choked the drain. A new sewerage system needs to be installed here or every year we will face waterlogging,” said RL Goyal, president, Sector 19-B RWA.Manimajra fared badly as a railway under bridge (RUB) was flooded. “The levelling of the RUB is such that the water doesn’t drain quickly,” said Col Gursewak Singh (retd), president, Modern Housing Complex (MHC) RWA .Taking stock of the situation, MC chief engineer Shailender SIngh said, “around 50% of the 30,000 road gullies have been cleaned and the rest will be done soon. We should be able to finish before the monsoons start.” He said they received no waterlogging complaints on Friday as it rained for a short spell.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/50-minute-rain-exposes-chinks-in-chandigarh-s-drainage-system/story-4gJvXkKIQ3pgMVUTxzImpO.html

However, examinations will be made optional for non-professional courses across all state universities, Samant said.In a Facebook Live session held on Friday evening, Samant added that for professional courses, including law, engineering, architecture, pharmacy and hotel management, the state government has written to individual exam councils, including All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE), Council of Architecture (CoA) and Bar Council of India (BCI), asking them to accept the promotion of students instead of holding exams.“We had initially announced that the status of exams will depend on the Covid-19 situation and as the situation in Maharashtra continues to remain grim, we wrote to exam councils of all professional courses. The status will be decided based on their [central councils] responses,” said Samant.Over the past few weeks, students and colleges repeatedly sought clarity over the status of allowed to keep term (ATKT)/backlog exams of final-year students. Samant announced that the Maharashtra government will decide on it in the next couple of days. “Once our appointed committee decides how ATKTs of final-year students can be handled, we will share the information. Individual universities can then decide how to implement it,” he said. A total of 7.3 lakh students are part of non-professional courses across 14 state universities.“All students from non-professional courses will give in writing to the university if they wish to give the examinations or not. Students who don’t wish to give exams will be promoted on the basis of their previous semester performance. We will release their results. We have also asked universities to schedule exams by following social distancing norms for those who wish to appear for exams,” said Samant. On May 31, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray announced that state universities will not hold any exams for final-year students for academic year 2019-20. In his address to the state, Thackeray announced that with the lockdown extended till June 30, the state will have no choice but to promote final-year students based on their performance of the previous and current semester. However, a day later the Governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari, who is the chancellor of all state universities, said such a decision will jeopardise the future of students.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/can-t-hold-final-year-exams-tests-for-non-professional-courses-optional-maharashtra-government/story-rrYZUedcvFN42Fxf8x0qbO.html
20-06-2020||City||Out of work, Mumbai’s dabbawalas may look for new ways to serve||The city’s iconic lunchbox delivery men, the dabbawalas, were forced out of their 130-year-old occupation by the lockdown. However, with local trains resuming services and Mumbai gradually returning to the grind, dabbawalas are now planning to do what the city does best — get back to work and adapt to changing times.When the lockdown shut down public transport and people started working from home, dabbawalas found themselves without work. Although lockdown restrictions have eased in Maharashtra since June 1, schools and colleges remain shut and only a small percentage of employees may go into offices. “There is no doubt our business will continue to see a slump for a few more months even after lockdown is lifted because work-from-home will continue for a lot of our customers. If dabbawalas are not needed, we can do other kinds of deliveries, like courier and mail deliveries, or e-commerce,” said Subhash Talekar, president of Mumbai’s dabbawala association. Adapting will be more of a challenge to some. Sixty-five-year-old Yamunatji Ghule, a member of the dabbawala association, said, “I am not as physically fit anymore. I can’t carry all the lunchboxes allotted to me. But I have worked as a dabbawala since 1970, so my colleagues share my work, lift a few of the lunchboxes allotted to me, and say ‘don’t work, just be a part of the group, and we will share your work’,” said Ghule, who returned to his village in Pune district in May. The average dabbawalla worked approximately 10 hours a day, starting around 9am. Each dabbawala delivered between 15 to 20 lunchboxes, and was paid between Rs 1,200 to Rs 1,500 per lunchbox per month. Their routes were along Western and Central Railway, with 40 to 50 dabbawalas covering each station and the areas around it.During the first few weeks of the lockdown, when no one could leave Mumbai, most of the 5,000 dabbawalas in the city tore through their savings. When transport was arranged for migrant labourers, some like Ghule left Mumbai for their village homes, mostly in Western Maharashtra, where they have returned to farming. Ghule is among those looking forward to returning to Mumbai.Back in 1890, the profession of the dabbawala began to ensure white collar workers from the Parsi community had home-cooked meals. The first dabbawalas picked up lunchboxes from people’s homes and brought them to their offices in south Bombay. Since then, Mumbai’s work culture and the lunchbox delivery business has changed. Dabbawalas have added new routes and clients — today they deliver lunch to a range of people, including small businessmen, government employees, as well as school and college students. “These people will always go to work and need their lunch delivered from home once the city restarts properly,” said Talekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/out-of-work-mumbai-s-dabbawalas-may-look-for-new-ways-to-serve/story-R6Kh5hl8mxlKUUcEUltlQK.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||15 years on, Chandigarh MC finally takes over Dadumajra waste processing plant||The Chandigarh municipal corporation on Friday finally took over the reigns of the controversial Jaypee-run waste processing plant in Dadumajra.The plant’s fate, however, still remains uncertain.A technical committee set up by the MC will examine the mechanical condition of the plant, and report on how quickly the plant can be made operational and whether it requires major repair works or upgrades.MC officials on Friday accompanied by the duty magistrate and the police took over the possession of the plant even though firm officials said a stay order was in operation.Stating that no time frame as of now could be given on the restarting of the plant, MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “We have set up a technical committee to study the condition of the plant. Experts from IIT Roorkee will also be part of the committee. They will submit a report by the first week of July.”PANEL SET UP TO ANALYSE PLANT“The committee will find out the plant’s internal strength and make appropriate decisions regarding upgrades. In case the experts find that the entire machinery is defunct, we will have to explore the option of setting up a new plant,” added Yadav.The MC takeover of the plant on Friday came consequent to the termination notice issued on March 5 to Jaypee group.The MC General House terminated Jaypee’s contract in March this year. The civic body issued a termination notice on March 5 asking the firm to hand over the plant within a week. The district courts, however, after being approached by Jaypee, stayed the order on March 12 up to June 12, following which MC initiated the action.Since the order passed was for a definite period, which expired and there was no order of stay by any court of law, the impugned order dated March 5 passed by the MC stood active. Consequently on Thursday, the MC issued a 24-hour notice to the firm for handing over the possession.PLANT WASN’T RUNNING ON OPTIMUM CAPACITYThe MC had signed an agreement with Jaypee in 2005 for setting up a garbage processing plant, which over the years was not operated to its optimum capacity. The plant was only processing 120 metric tonnes (MT) of waste against a requirement of 450 MT, with the remaining waste being illegally dumped in the open ground nearby. Despite several notices from the MC to rectify the defects, Jaypee did not make any changes.Even the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in one of its orders had directed the MC to make alternative arrangements if it was no longer viable to work with Jaypee. The tribunal had also rejected the firm’s plea for a tipping fee for running the plant and slammed Jaypee for not running the plant efficiently.Yadav said the aim of the takeover was to make waste management efficient in the city. The MC will operate the plant and bear the running costs. “Efficient garbage management in the city is one of the priorities of the MC, and consequently, MC will bear the cost of running and maintenance of the plant. Now, we can have holistic waste management from collection to final disposal,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/15-years-on-chandigarh-mc-finally-takes-over-dadumajra-waste-processing-plant/story-18HrMuuhmNoVgCJUX1el3M.html

20-06-2020||Mumbai||MMRDA cancels bids of two Chinese firms for 10 monorail rakes||Following Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s call for an ‘Atmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliant India) and amid the stand-off between India and China at Galwan Valley in Ladakh, the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) has cancelled the bids to manufacture 10 monorail rakes received from two Chinese companies – CRRC Corporation Ltd and BYD Co Ltd. HT had reported on Wednesday that an MMRDA notification had stated that the bids for the rakes had been scrapped for the second time in six months. However, it had not cited any reason for the termination then. MMRDA said the Chinese firms were constantly asking for revisions in terms and conditions. “As the two Chinese companies are dictating us to change tender conditions, MMRDA has decided to look for technology partners in India. As we do not require large quantities, it is possible for Indian firms to manufacture and supply (the coaches) in less time,” MMRDA metropolitan commissioner RA Rajeev said. “We will start the re-tendering process immediately with revised eligibility criteria, such as manufacturing facilities established in India for the past 10 years on similar projects to enable participation of Indian firms,” a senior MMRDA official said.The official also said that talks have been initiated with Indian manufacturers namely Bharat Earth Movers Limited (BEML) and Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mmrda-cancels-bids-of-two-chinese-firms-for-10-monorail-rakes/story-RKQeQ3Sn41zrgi6QY3bCKJ.html
20-06-2020||Mumbai||Six Chinese firms working on infra projects in Mumbai||With many politicians demanding a boycott of Chinese products and firms following a tense situation on the border with China, there are questions being raised about the Chinese companies that are involved in the Metro and other major infrastructure projects in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR).There are approximately six Chinese companies involved in infrastructure projects in Mumbai, which is in the process of a massive overhaul of its infrastructure. The estimated cost of the entire 337km Metro project is ₹1 lakh crore. Of these, Shanghai Tunnel Engineering Co Ltd (STEC), China Railway Tunnel Group Co Ltd (CRTG) and Continental Engineering Corporation (CEC) are undertaking civil and tunnel works for Metro-3 (Colaba-Bandra-Seepz). The Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC), which is building the fully-underground Metro, has appointed the SJEC Corporation, a Chinese consortium, for system works.CRTG in a joint venture with J Kumar Infraprojects Ltd is also building parts of Metro-2A (Dahisar-DN Nagar) and Metro-6 (Swami Samarth Nagar-Vikhroli). Another Chinese company, China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC), is building part of Metro-4 (Wadala-Kasarvadavali) in a joint venture with Tata Projects.While MMRC did not respond to queries, a senior official from Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority (MMRDA) said the involvement of the Chinese companies “stands as it is”. “So far there is no advisory [against the involvement of Chinese companies],” said the official on condition of anonymity.STEC was also shortlisted to build two underground sewer-water tunnels between Borivli and Goregaon, a ₹50-crore project being undertaken by the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). For the coastal road project, BMC was also exploring the possibility of hiring a team from China to assemble a tunnel boring machine. The 9.8 km coastal road will have 3.4-km-long twin tunnels, which will run partially under the sea between Girgaum Chowpatty and Malabar Hill. Ravi Raja, Congress corporator and leader of Opposition in BMC, on Thursday tweeted, “Considering the atrocities and violations in Galwan valley, I propose that BMC should ban Chinese machinery or technology in all their projects. Also, they should sever ties with consultants or firms if involved in any which way with any projects BMC has undertaken.” Atul Shah, spokesperson of the Bharatiya Janata Party, said some “tough decisions” need to be taken. “Emotions are running high in the country because of what happened to our soldiers. People in large numbers are already boycotting or returning Chinese goods,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/six-chinese-firms-working-on-infra-projects-in-mumbai/story-7n2n0fFkyYulHlN8BRMOrN.html
20-06-2020||Mumbai||25-year-old held for duping bizman of ₹1.94 crore by faking PMO, NSA email IDs||Bandra police arrested a 25-year-old woman from Mumbai airport on Monday for cheating a businessman from Bandra of ₹1.94 crore. The accused had allegedly claimed she needed the money to study in Delhi to pursue her ambition to clear UPSC examinations and created fake email accounts of the Prime Minister’s office (PMO) and national security advisor (NSA) Ajit Doval to convince the businessman that she was recruited by the intelligence bureau. According to the complaint registered by the 62-year-old businessman Manohar Tank, the accused’s mother used to visit his house for his wife’s cosmetic treatment and had requested him to financially help her daughter to clear UPSC exams in 2016.“Tank agreed to sponsor her studies. But the accused kept borrowing money from him under different pretexts. In 2018, she told Tank that she had cleared the exam and was recruited by the intelligence bureau. When Tank asked her to return the money, she said she would return the money soon,” said sub-inspector Sachin Chaudhary.Following this, Tank received emails, supposedly from the PMO and NSA’s email id, saying the prime minister was happy with him for having helped the accused, said Chaudhary. “Tank received several such mails. One of those mails said PMO would pay the money he had spent on the accused,” said Chaudhary.Last year, Kadam told Tank that she was posted to Pakistan and Dubai for secret mission and met with an accident, and borrowed money for her supposed treatment, said police officers.In June this year when Tank verified the email address, he realised the accused had cheated him, following which he lodged a complaint with Bandra police station on June 5. “We registered an offence under relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code and Information Technology Act,” said Chaudhary.On Monday, when the accused returned to Mumbai from Delhi, she was arrested at the airport and has since been remanded in police custody. During interrogation, the police learnt that she had completed a course in fashion designing, for which she had borrowed money from Tank. To maintain her profile, she used to live in a rented apartment for ₹1.7 lakh per month, said police officers.“The accused had even kept her mother in the dark,” said Chaudhary. Meanwhile, the accused was subjected to Covid-19 test at JJ Hospital according to protocol and was found to be positive, following which she has been kept under quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/25-year-old-held-for-duping-bizman-of-1-94-crore-by-faking-pmo-nsa-email-ids/story-LtBzlwdswTTFS6S3dY08jK.html

20-06-2020||Mumbai||Man sentenced to 12 years in jail for sexually assaulting minor||The special court under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act has convicted a man for sexually assaulting his 13-year-old niece in 2015. The accused, the husband of the minor’s mother’s sister, kidnapped her and abused her to take revenge on the minor’s mother on suspicion that she provoked his wife against him.Special judge Priti Kumar Ghule said, “It is seen that the accused committed the offence due to anger as his wife left him based on the words of the minor’s mother. He wanted his wife to return back and was frustrated. The accused did not use maximum force on the minor and did not cause bleeding. The act of accused is condemnable, but he stopped himself before the worst act of deep penetration into her vagina. In these circumstances, I do not find it fit and proper to give a maximum punishment of life imprisonment.”As per the prosecution case, on June 7, 2015, the accused had fought with his wife and had decided to leave his house. The prosecution alleged the accused, a vegetable vendor, was addicted to alcohol which was the reason for frequent quarrels between the couple.After the incident, the accused left the house and went to the minor’s house in Wadala between 5pm and 6pm. Meanwhile, the girl’s mother visited the accused’s house in Kurla. Assuming that the minor’s mother provoked his wife, the accused decided to take revenge, the prosecution claimed.The accused allegedly told the girl to accompany her claiming her mother was unwell and had to be taken to hospital. The accused along with his friend, who died pending the trial, took her near a temple in Kurla and sexually assaulted her.The prosecution argued that the statements of witnesses, which included the minor’s neighbours who saw the accused taking the girl, the minor, her mother, as well as the medical report support the prosecution case. It was proved that the accused took the girl and sexually abused her. Considering the evidence, the special court held the accused guilty of sexual assault on the minor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/man-sentenced-to-12-years-in-jail-for-sexually-assaulting-minor/story-jr4saALdRIQHPZRSb1Z1QP.html

According to police, the victim, Vinayak Khadilkar, a Wadala resident, was returning home from bank after withdrawing ₹5,000 on Thursday around 9.25am when the incident took place. An unknown person allegedly stopped him near the post office on RAK Marg and asked him not to roam alone saying a murder had taken place in the area. The man then took Khadilkar to a side while the accused’s associate came on bike and started talking to the victim, said senior inspector Sunil Sohani, RAK Marg police station. While one of the accused talked to Khadilkar, the other took his gold chain, ring and the cash worth a total of ₹90,000. The accused then kept a small plastic pouch in the victim’s pocket saying his gold ornaments were in it, added the officer. “The victim did not realise anything that was happening with him. It seems he had been hypnotised,” added Sohani. After Khadilkar came home and checked the pouch, he realised his ornaments were missing. “We have registered a case of cheating against two unknown persons.

20-06-2020||Mumbai||Maharashtra records 3,827 Covid-19 cases, highest 1-day rise again; peak expected in July?||The surge in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra continued on Friday, when the state for the second consecutive day recorded a highest one-day spike in infections. The state’s case count rose by 3,827 cases, taking its tally to 1,24,331. Of these, 55,651 are active cases, the state health department said. The state also reported 142 deaths on Friday, taking its toll to 5,893. Of the fatalities, 114 were in Mumbai, 21 in Pune, eight in Aurangabad, five in Vasai-Virar, three each in Raigad, Nashik, Dhule, Jalgaon, two in Thane, and one in Solapur.Mumbai, the worst hit city in India, recorded 1,264 cases, as its tally rose to 64,139. Of these, 28,442 are active cases. The city’s toll stands at 3,425.With cases rising rapidly, the state expects a sharp surge in the coming days. This month has already seen the maximum cases — 56,679 — being reported in the state since the outbreak began on March 9. Of the 1,24,331 cases, 45.58% have been reported in June so far. State officials said they expect the Covid cases curve to peak in July. “According to fresh projections, the peak is likely to come in July. If that happens, it will take another month for the cases to decline and by September, the situation may come under complete control,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.State health minister Rajesh Tope had recently said the “peak has started”. “The fresh cases will continue to rise for the next 15-20 days as the peak has started. The situation in the state will stabilise and we will be able to settle things down soon. I’m saying this going by what is happening in other countries,” Tope had said on Saturday.Dr Avinash Supe, former dean KEM Hospital and a member of the expert committee appointed by the state to study and analyse data and recommend new measures to curb the spread, said, “In some areas, cases are going down, whereas in some other areas, they are increasing. So it is very difficult to say when the actual peak will come. The peak may come as a wave and it would be different at different places.”More concerning for the government is the rise in case fatality rate (CFR), which stands at 4.74%. By May-end, the state had brought down CFR to 3.26% from 7.41% on April 13. But it has risen again.“There could be two reasons behind rise in case fatality rate. One, some deaths were not reported, as patients had died due to heart attack, but they were Covid-19 positive and some municipal corporations had not added them in their toll. This they have started doing now. Second, more focus on symptomatic patients. With change in guidelines, our focus is now only on symptomatic patients and we may not have picked the asymptomatic patients at the right time for treatment,” said Supe.According to fresh guidelines from the Ministry of Health, asymptomatic and mild cases of Covid-19 don’t need hospitalisation. Also, only those who are in close contact of Covid-19 positive patients are allowed to get tested. The CFR concern was also discussed in a review meeting chaired by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. He instructed officials that there should not be any negligence in aggressive contact tracing and testing as that is the only way to contain the spread. Chief secretary Ajoy Mehta pointed out that the spread of pandemic is found more in areas where contact tracing is less than 10 people, indicating that it needs to be done more aggressively.Thackeray also directed constituting a task force comprising experts and senior doctors at district or division level. “We have greatly benefited with the task force constituted in Mumbai to contain the spread. As cases are rising, it has become necessary to constitute such task forces at district or division level,” the chief minister said in the meeting. He also said there should not be any delay in Covid-19 test reports and laboratories must provide them at the earliest.Meanwhile, the constant improvement in recovery rate has brought some relief to the state. On Friday, the recovery rate reached 50.49% from 31.05% (on May 27), after 1,935 patients recovered in the past 24 hours.

20-06-2020||Mumbai||Forest department arrests 12 poachers, seizes equipment worth ₹4.46 lakh||The Maharashtra forest department busted a poaching operation in Satara district, arrested 12 people, and seized poaching material worth ₹4,46,200, on Thursday. Forest officials said a 600-metre long and 300-metre broad snare trap was laid to capture animals near Padli village at a farm adjacent to the reserved forest area. “After local villagers spotted the group of poachers setting up the trap, they informed one of our forest rangers. We immediately deployed a team and identified their exact location,” said V Clement Ben, chief conservator of forest, Kolhapur. “Fortunately, no animal was caught within the period they set up the trap and we nabbed them.”Four motorcycles, one four-wheeler, 10 snares made using a combination of nylon ropes and wire meshes, and 10 wooden logs were seized and two dogs were taken into the forest department’s custody. “The poachers had trained the dogs to assist them in catching animals. The minute a wild boar, deer, hare etc. entered the farm, the dogs would chase them to a corner and the snare or wire mesh would snap around the animal’s leg,” said Vishwas Bhadale, assistant conservator of forest (Satara), one of the officers who led the operation. “The trap was laid in such a manner that even a leopard could have been caught in the wire snare,” he added.Forest officials said all arrested accused belonged to nearby villages, mainly Karal. “Based on our investigation, we found that some of the accused were past offenders. Their intent was to catch a wild boar for bush meat, and sell it nearby areas for quick money,” said Bhadale.The accused were presented before a district court on Friday. According to the Wildlife Protection Act 1972, any hunting attempt is a punishable offence for at least three years or a fine of up to ₹25,000 or both. “However, all 12 accused were granted bail considering they had not managed to complete the poaching operation and to decongest the local jail due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They were let out on the condition that they report to the range forest office once a week for further investigations,” said Bhadale.Maharashtra has witnessed a surge in wildlife crimes in June with 19 people arrested between June 1 and 11 in a multi-district illegal wildlife trade racket busted by the forest department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/forest-department-arrests-12-poachers-seizes-equipment-worth-4-46-lakh/story-5cpprpo2qBZBwMQGJ0rXVM.html

The court directed the authorities to conduct a proper survey to evaluate the losses suffered by the community and to compensate them accordingly.The fishing community, represented by Damodar Tandel, informed the bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice KK Tated through advocate Rakesh Bhatkar that as the losses they suffered during Cyclone Phyan were not compensated, the court should ensure that their concerns regarding the losses owing to Cyclone Nisarga are addressed, as without the compensation they would not be able to revive their activities.Bhatkar submitted that unless a proper survey was undertaken it would not be possible to ascertain the extent of losses suffered by the fishing community, and hence the concerned authorities should be directed to conduct the survey as soon as possible. He further submitted that various representations were already made on behalf of the fishing community to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray in this regard. The counsel for the state submitted that the state would ensure that the grievances of the community were taken care of as per the representations made to the CM.After hearing the submissions, the court directed the authorities to conduct a proper survey within three weeks and decide on the compensation to be paid to the affected persons and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/evaluate-losses-of-fishing-community-due-to-cyclone-nisarga-compensate-them-hc-tells-state/story-jZ9Jj3JVvtF47TUiH9Gc7L.html
20-06-2020||City||Hand over Covid-19 test report directly to patient, kin, SC tells Maharashtra government||The Supreme Court on Friday directed the Maharashtra government to provide Covid-19 test reports directly to patients and their relatives. The order, by a three-judge bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan, came as part of the suo moto monitoring of facilities to Covid-19 patients.The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) had issued a circular on June 13, stating that the test report will not be shared by the laboratory directly with the patient. “Laboratory will share the report with MCGM (Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai) and MCGM in return will share it with the patients,” the circular had said.The Indian Medical Association (IMA), as well as doctors, had complained against the circular, saying it is leading to delays in the treatment of Covid-19 patients. “Because of the new rule, patients come to know about the result of the test after three to four days, and during this time their symptoms may aggravate and may become serious,” IMA had said.“This is why we are insisting on having a uniform policy for all states. See this order passed by Maharashtra government,” the SC said. “We have no doubt states and all concerned shall supply a copy of the patient’s report to him or his relatives and the hospital.”Solicitor General Tushar Mehta found the order “illogical” and said such an order ought to be withdrawn. The bench asked Maharashtra government counsel, Sachin Patil, to take instructions and persuade the government to withdraw the order.The BMC said it will ask laboratories to hand over test reports directly to patients and their relatives, but hospitals will have to take permission from the civic Covid-19 war rooms before admitting an infected person. “For asymptomatic patients, we have CCC-2 (Covid Care Centre) and hospital beds are reserved only for symptomatic patients. So the hospitals will have to inform war rooms in their respective civic wards before admitting patients. This is for better management of beds,” said Dr Daksha Shah, deputy health officer, BMC.Earlier on Friday, before the SC order came, BMC commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had explained the logic behind asking laboratories to share report only with the civic body and not patients. “Most of the Covid-19 beds and Covid-19 ICU beds in 35 private hospitals in Mumbai are occupied by asymptomatic positive patients. This, because, after directly receiving the test reports, they [asymptomatic patients] rush to private hospitals out of anxiety and fear of complications and immediately get admitted,” said Chahal, adding that this results in a symptomatic Covid-19 patients, who are in need of medical attention, not finding beds in private hospitals.The Association of Medical Consultants (AMC), however, expressed satisfaction over the Apex Court overruling BMC’s policy. “This led to unnecessary delay of reports. The private laboratories provide reports only after two-three days. The civic body takes additional time to inform the patients. In the meantime, the patient keeps waiting for treatment,” said Dr Deepak Baid, president of the association. “While the patients wait, their oxygen saturation deteriorates and then they collapse within a few hours of admission.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hand-over-covid-19-test-report-directly-to-patient-kin-sc-tells-maharashtra-government/story-rvtSZ4NWWIhCmJg4Be8ppI.html

Through Lobo, Wagle reached out to 25 transgenders in Mahim and 100 more in Ulhasnagar, and has been providing them with essentials and other help, with assistance from Lobo.“With the help of family and friends, we raised around ₹ 75,000, with which we bought essential kits, consisting of rice, dal, flour, oil, spices, masks and sanitiser for the community members,” said Wagle, a Borivli resident. Lobo said the kit provided by Wagle can be utilised for a month. “Many in our community have been affected owing to the lockdown, as most of them either beg on trains, signals or are sex workers,” said Lobo.To continue working for the community even after the lockdown ends, Wagle also started an initiative, ‘Identify- the world for transgender’, through which she aims to help transgenders seek employment in the future.With Identify, we aim to make the younger generation understand our problems and hope to be accepted as part of society,” said Lobo.“This is one community which has been ignored largely by society.

20-06-2020||Mumbai||Despite Centre’s go-ahead, Maharashtra zoos refuse to open for visitors||Zoological parks and wildlife rescue centres across Maharashtra have refused to reopen for visitors for the time being, in a bid to keep captive animals and its staff safe during the Covid-19 pandemic.Days after the Central Zoo Authority (CZA) under the Union environment ministry allowed zoo operators to take a call on reopening zoological parks to visitors following the relaxation of lockdown rules under Unlock 1 from June 1, a review by the Maharashtra Zoo Authority (MZA) showed that none of the state zoos have opted to reopen.The decision comes at a time when Melghat Tiger Reserve was reopened for tourists on Friday while the buffer area of Pench and Tadoba Andhari Tiger Reserve will be reopened from July 1.There are 10 zoological parks and four rescue centres in the state. Of these, two are medium-sized zoos – Virmata Jijabai Bhonsale Udyan and Zoo in Byculla, and Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park and Wildlife Research Centre in Pune. The remaining eight are mini zoos across Pune, Nagpur, Aurangabad, Solapur, Kolhapur, as well as the Sanjay Gandhi National Park in Borivli (classified as a mini zoo by CZA).“We reviewed all the major zoos. So far, none of them are open for visitors due to prevailing local situation and threat of the pandemic,” said Ravikiran Govekar, member secretary, MZA. “We have asked the zoo operators to consult local authorities empowered by the Epidemic Act and Disaster Management Act before taking any decision.”As per the circular issued by CZA on June 10, based on guidelines from the Ministry of Home Affairs, the decision to reopen zoos for the public has to be taken by zoo operators based on consultation from the state disaster management authority. “Zoological parks across Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh were reopened for the public but there have been no visitors at all,” said SP Yadav, member secretary, CZA. “The final decision has to be taken by state authorities and the zookeepers based on the prevailing Covid-19 situation across the city, district or state,” he said.Byculla Zoo authorities said they have no plans to reopen till the end of July. “The Mumbai Metropolitan Region continues to have some of the highest Covid-19 positive cases in India, and it is not wise to reopen the zoo at the moment,” said Sanjay Tripathi, zoo director. “Our zoo comes under the large entertainment park category, and no relaxations have been issued for that category by the state or civic body. It will be safer for captive animals and our 35 staff members who have been residing within the zoo premises since March.”Other zoo operators highlighted the example of a tiger that had tested positive for the SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19, at Bronx Zoo in New York on April 5. “Among 450 animals, birds and reptiles, we have a large number of big cats. Under no circumstances can we risk their safety by reopening the zoos at the moment,” said Rajkumar Jadhav, zoo director, Rajiv Gandhi Zoological Park in Pune.Meanwhile, rescued or captured tigers have been sent for rehabilitation and treatment to the Gorewada Wildlife Rescue Centre in Nagpur during the pandemic. Officials said they had to be extra careful after the Bronx case and ensure minimal human contact with the animals. “We plan to inaugurate the zoo only after Nagpur is declared a green zone. We have one of the highest numbers of captive and rescued tigers with us. So far, no animals have displayed symptoms of illness,” said Nandkishor Kale, divisional manager, Gorewada project.Meanwhile, CZA on June 11 had also directed the mandatory deployment of round-the-clock veterinarians at zoos, to keep a close watch on the behaviour and health parameters of the captive animals. “All zoos are complying with CZA directives and are trying their best to provide required health facilities,” said Govekar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/despite-centre-s-go-ahead-maharashtra-zoos-refuse-to-open-for-visitors/story-socLqGd4iR429Om5mKHehL.html

Later in the day, the Supreme Court directed the Maharashtra government to provide the reports of Covid-19 tests directly to the patients and their relatives.The petitioner stated the circular was violative of the fundamental rights of the patient and by not issuing the report to the patient, the lives of relatives and those who came in contact with the patient were being put at risk.

20-06-2020||Mumbai||Why BMC decided that lab reports should be given only to the civic body||Hours before the Supreme Court (SC) on Friday directed the Maharashtra government to provide reports of Covid-19 tests to patients and their relatives directly, Brihanmumbai Municipal Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal had clarified the logic behind asking private laboratories to share reports only with the civic body – many asymptomatic patients, after learning that they were positive, were getting admitted to private hospitals, taking away the beds meant for symptomatic patients.BMC in a circular issued on June 13 had said: “No positive test report shall be shared by the laboratory with the patient directly. Laboratory has to share the report only with BMC and BMC in turn shall share it with the patient.” The opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) had objected to it, stating family members of those who test positive should get the information immediately rather than waiting for BMC to inform the patients. The SC bench headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan passed the order as part of the suo motu monitoring of facilities to Covid-19 patients.In a clarification issued on Friday before the SC’s direction, Chahal said that beds in 35 private hospitals were occupied by asymptomatic patients, and under the pretext of not denying beds to walk-in patients, these hospitals are breaching trust of BMC and not allowing the civic body to allot beds there. “It has come to my knowledge that most Covid beds and Covid ICU beds in major 35 private hospitals in Mumbai are occupied by asymptomatic patients. This is because after directly receiving positive test reports from laboratories, they rush to private hospitals out of anxiety and fear of complications and immediately get admitted before a positive symptomatic patient from the list can be allotted the Covid-19 bed or Covid-19 ICU bed in these hospitals, through our ward-level war rooms,” said the municipal commissioner.Chahal said the Indian Council of Medical Research’s (ICMR) guidelines state that asymptomatic positive patients shall not be allotted beds in Covid hospitals in dedicated Covid hospitals and dedicated Covid health centres. However, as these asymptomatic positive patients get direct access to test reports from laboratories, they rush to these hospitals, pay money and occupy the beds. BMC chief said the hospital too is happy as these patients are as good as quarantined, requiring no treatment. “They earn money from their admissions, clearly violating ICMR guidelines of not allotting beds to such a category of positive patients,” he said.According to civic corporation’s data, as of Wednesday, the bed occupancy rate for 17,000 Covid-19 beds is 69%, 96% for ICU beds, and 97% for ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/why-bmc-decided-that-lab-reports-should-be-given-only-to-the-civic-body/story-fTxKMEWqkRq3W8FJ5NJZBI.html
20-06-2020||Chandigarh||Ludhiana residents paid Rs 40 lakh fine for not wearing masks, spitting in open||It seems the city’s residents prefer paying fines over following the rules as the Ludhiana Police have collected over Rs 40 lakh from lockdown violators in the past 85 days. Of this, Rs 37.6 lakh has been collected from those found venturing out without a mask while Rs 2.2 lakh has been collected from residents for spitting in public places.Officials say the fine amount was increased on May 29 to discourage violators but that too seems to have no effect.Deputy commissioner of police (DCP, headquarters) Akhil Chaudhary says violations continue unabated despite the government’s concentrated efforts at generating awareness. “We have so far issued 10,667 challans for not wearing masks and caught 2,192 people for spitting in the open. Besides, 18 people have been fined for not following social distancing norms and two for violating home quarantine.”He said the cases against the violators are issued under Section 188 (disobedience to order duly promulgated by public servant) of the Indian Penal Code. As per the police, most violators are in the age group of 18 to 40. When caught, they make excuses, saying that they forgot to wear the mask or lost their mask while riding the two-wheeler. Cops also say that those caught spitting in the open are mostly habitual tobacco chewers, who end up putting others’ lives at risk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/ludhiana-residents-paid-rs-40-lakh-fine-for-not-wearing-masks-spitting-in-open/story-OpOUK7rriQIWHJk2CeWK4L.html

Bala Devi said after her husband’s demise, the panchayat told her to not step foot in the village till her son turned 18.“A panchayat was called after my in-laws refused to give me my husband’s share of land after his demise. They then agreed to register the same in my son’s name, but objected to my entry into their house. However this week, the panchayat passed a diktat banning my entry into the village for the next 15 years. It has asked me to live at my parental home along with my son and daughter and allowed to rejoin my in-laws only after my son turns 18,” Devi said.Stating that the panchayat had done injustice with her, Devi added, “It is very difficult for me to live at my parental home for so long.”When contacted, sarpanch Sadhu Ram agreed that the panchayat did pass an order to such effect.“We had called a panchayat after Devi and her in-laws were constantly engaging in domestic fights. Initially, the in-laws were accusing Devi of her husband’s death, but later accepted their mistake. We have asked Devi to return to her in-laws’ house when her son attains the age of 18 years,” the sarpanch added. Bhuna block development and panchayat officer Mahender Singh said the panchayat has done injustice to the widow and the sarpanch did not have any right to pass such a diktat.“We can take action only against the sarpanch. Rest of the investigation will be done by the police, if the woman files an official complaint,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fatehabad-village-panchayat-bans-entry-of-widow-for-15-years/story-Mou4SkD6h4As1DVTBzBSPI.html
20-06-2020||City||2 Covid patients in Kalyan die awaiting treatment||In two separate incidents, Covid-19 patients died while waiting for hospital beds in Kalyan this week. Both the patients had been suffering from breathlessness but since the result of their swab tests were awaited, they did not get admitted to Covid hospitals while the civic-run Rukminibai Hospital, a non-Covid hospital, did not have ventilators.In the first incident, a 43-year-old man died at a Covid Hospital in Kalyan (West) on Friday.The patient’s sister said, “My elder brother was having issues with breathing and high fever. My younger brother went to every hospital but none of them admitted him and we were asked to go to Holy Cross Covid hospital at Karnik Road. When we reached there, the doctors said they could not admit the patient as the test report was awaited and only treated Covid cases. My brother died on the hospital premises on the same day.”A day after his death, the man’s test results confirmed he was positive for Covid-19. The sister said that her younger brother is also showing symptoms and is scared after this incident.In the second incident which took place on June 16, a 57-year-old man died at Rukminibai Hospital in Kalyan (West).The deceased’s 32-year-old son said, “My father was suffering from fever since June 12, for which he had taken medicines from our family doctor and did typhoid and malaria tests. He tested positive for typhoid. Meanwhile, our doctor also suggested doing a Covid test. On June 14 he was tested and the next day he started suffering from breathing problems.”The family went to Rukminibai Hospital where there was no ventilator. Doctors gave him oxygen and he was sent to another private hospital. The private hospital refused to admit the patient and he was made to return to Rukminibai.“My father was on a stretcher with an oxygen mask and couldn’t breathe. There was no treatment given on time. There were no beds available,” said the victim’s son. Following his death, the 57-year-old was tested and found to be infected with the coronavirus.Hospital authorities have denied any negligence on their part. An official from Rukminibai Hospital said, “The 57-year-old patient was immediately provided with oxygen as he was in a severe condition. Rukminibai is a non-Covid hospital and hence we do not have a ventilator. We send such patients to the Covid hospital with oxygen support. The same procedure was followed for the patient.”Spokesperson for Kalyan Doctors Army, that handles Covid patients at Holy Cross Covid Hospital, Prashant Patil said,”When there are no beds available, we tell the family so that their time is not wasted and the patient gets admission in some other hospital. Also, if a patient’s report is awaited, we don’t admit them because its a Covid hospital and tomorrow if the patient’s report is negative, there are chances he could get infected from the hospital. Only those who test positive are admitted here.” As per Kalyan Doctors Army, which is closely working with the KDMC, the civic body had earlier given directions to private hospitals to not deny admission in severe suspected cases. “Private hospitals should not deny any patient even if their report is awaited. Covid hospitals can only admit positive cases,” said Patil. Epidemic officer of Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC) Pratibha Paanpatil said, “The 43-year-old patient who died near the hospital was very severe and arrangements to admit him were underway when he died. He was given oxygen support, however, he succumbed before he was admitted. As per the directions from the KDMC chief, we will inquire into both cases and check if there was any negligence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/2-covid-patients-in-kalyan-die-awaiting-treatment/story-8IElCF2W6g8V78zrlfMaYN.html

20-06-2020||Delhi||DU student to be first wheelchair-bound Indian to study at Oxford||“I met with a severe car accident on my way from Hoshiarpur to Chandigarth (Punjab), with my family. I was 13 then. With various other injuries, my spinal cord broke and made me paralytic from chest down,” recalls Pratishtha Deveshwar, a final year student of Lady Shri Ram College, Delhi University, in a matter-of-fact tone. Remembering the incident that changed her life is of course not easy for her, yet her voice gleams with positivity as she says in the same breath: “People with disabilities can achieve anything!” On the path to make her belief and statement true, Deveshwar had been a high ranker in academics, and convinced her family that she could stay all by herself in Delhi, after being home schooled. “I always knew that I could overcome my situation only with education. So, after 12th, I told my parents that I don’t want to live inside the four walls of my home anymore; I deserve better. I applied to LSR, and got admission! That changed my life,” says Deveshwar who was soon spotted on a wheelchair on Delhi roads, with shopping bags hanging on either sides. “Everyone advised my family to not to send me to Delhi because I’m differently-abled, and was dependent on them. So (they thought) it would be impossible for me to live alone. But, the word impossible was never in my dictionary! I started living by myself — did grocery shopping, paid bills and even travelled, by myself, almost the whole of the city in the metro train. And don’t be surprised if you see me buzzing around the roads of Delhi again, on my wheelchair, after the pandemic ends.”  Thrilled to share that I'll be pursuing Masters in Public Policy from the University of Oxford!From the ICU where I fought for my life,to being the first wheelchair-user from India to get into Oxford-it has been a rollercoaster ride! I want to thank you all for your support!❤ pic.twitter.com/1K4t1D1jYMThis young lady has one more dream to fulfil, and that is to pursue higher studies at Oxford University, UK. “I applied to Oxford because their course on public policy is one of the best in the world, and I got through. In fact, I’ll be the first Indian who is wheelchair bound, to study at Oxford. I intend to study there, come back to India and use my knowledge for the betterment of 26.8 million people with disabilities in India, who urgently need to be empowered. Also, because I wanted to prove that my accident or wheelchair do not define me, and I’m not what happened to me but I am what I choose to be. I wanted to show it to the world that a woman in a wheelchair can achieve anything she dreams of, despite all the hurdles.”Studying at Oxford, however, is an expensive affair, and Deveshwar has been raising money on a crowdfunding platform to realise her dream. “Due to lack of scholarships, I decided to start a crowdfunding campaign because I sincerely believe that there is absolutely no hesitation in asking for help if the cause is genuine. And there are so many wonderful people out there who are willing and able to support. And I’m someone who sincerely believes in the goodness that prevails in the world. I just know in my heart that sharing my story of strength and determination will inspire people, and good vibes will come my way,” she says with a smile.

On Friday morning, the family received a call that the patient had died.On June 13, the patient, a resident of Chirag Nagar, was admitted to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Hospital in Kalwa after testing positive for Covid-19. However, when a relative of his reached the hospital on June 17 to enquire about his health, he was told that the patient has been shifted.The victim’s 48-year-old cousin said, “Initially, my brother, who is diabetic, did not have any symptoms. However, two days after being admitted, we were told that his condition had started deteriorating and he had been shifted to a private hospital. I went to the said hospital in Mumbra but could not locate my brother. The next day I again went to the Kalwa hospital where they gave me the same information but shared the contact number for Thane Civil Hospital. By Thursday night I came to know that my brother was shifted to Thane Civil Hospital, however, the next morning I was informed that he had died.”Till the time of going to press, the family was not informed about the cremation of the deceased.Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) officials said they had no knowledge of the incident. “We have alerted hospitals to be cautious and will enquire into this incident,” said Vishwanath Kelkar, health officer, TMC.MLC Niranjan Davkhare from the BJP has demanded an inquiry. “A proper inquiry should be done as this is not the first time that the negligence of hospitals has come to light,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/family-search-for-missing-covid-patient-find-him-only-after-his-death/story-w6G8Wsd9JmcF980egQIHqL.html
20-06-2020||Delhi||District admin to issue certificates for every negative rapid antigen test||People whose samples return negative after being tested using the rapid antigen method will be issued a certificate from respective district administrations, senior government officials said on Friday. Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev on Friday issued directions asking all 11 district magistrates to start handing out such certificates to everyone who tests negative. The chief secretary also reiterated ICMR guidelines and asked the district administrations to get RT-PCR tests mandatorily conducted on all symptomatic persons who test negative in the antigen detection tests.Prodded about the rationale behind the move, senior government officials did not have a clear answer. But some of them said that the move will help them track and trace those who test negative in the first antigen test for follow-up tests, if needed, in the coming weeks. “The Union ministry of home affair (MHA) has asked the Delhi government to issue certificates to those who test negative in the antigen tests. It was recommended by the expert committee, led by Dr VK Paul of the NITI Aayog. We are following the order in totality,” said a senior government official. Another official in the health department of the government said that the certificate is also meant to create awareness that the antigen detection test is not a fully confirmatory test, like the RT-PCR tests, which is considered gold standard in Covid-19 testing programme.As many as 193 centres across Delhi started antigen testing from Thursday. On the first day, of the 7,040 people who took it, 456 tested positive. Rapid antigen detection tests are quicker than RT-PCR Covid tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/admin-to-hand-out-certificates-to-those-who-test-negative-for-antigen-tests/story-fDa4YMYoGOSH5ktYaOPj6L.html

20-06-2020||Gurugram||Cost of Covid-19 tests in Haryana capped at ₹2,400||Haryana’s health department on Friday issued an order to regulate rates for Covid-19 tests in the state. the move comes a day after an expert panel of the Centre, headed by NITI Ayog member VK Paul, suggested that RT-PCR testing costs be capped at Rs 2400 for Delhi-NCR.  Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) tests — which is considered the gold standard in Covid-19 testing and diagnosis –– will now cost Rs 2400 in Gurugram and rest of Haryana, the order said.Senior officials of the state government confirmed that testing prices in Haryana were cut down after the national capital went ahead with the Central government committee’s decision of capping prices at Rs 2,400.. The official order regarding the same was released on Friday by the director general health services, Haryana government.The order states, “Taking into account the cost of kits on the basis of precedents in other states like Delhi, Maharashtra and Telangana, the state government directs that no private laboratory should charge an amount more than Rs 2400 for RT-PCR.”Rajeev Arora, additional chief secretary, health department, confirmed the move and said, “RT-PCR testing price have been capped to Rs 2,400.”The decision was taken under the Epidemic Disease Act, 1897. The order also mentions that the new price is inclusive of GST, cost involved in pick up, packing and transportation of samples, documentation and reporting.There are seven private laboratories in Gurugram approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) to conduct RT-PCR tests. Also, the state is providing free testing in 12 government laboratories, which are mostly in medical colleges, civil hospitals and other government institutions.Representatives of Core Diagnostics, a lab that works closely with Haryana government, refused to comment on the latest order.On March 17, RT-PCR testing was started in private labs and the upper limit for single test charges was capped at Rs 4500, based on the cost of imported kits and efforts involved in carrying out the test. Since testing supplies were stabilized and varied options of testing materials/kits, including indigenous ones, were more readily available, the ICMR on May 25 asked the states to negotiate and fix mutually agreeable prices for RT-PCR tests for Covid-19.The Haryana government on May 28, fixed the cost of RT-PCR test for detecting SARS-CoV-2 virus between Rs 2,500 and Rs 3,950, after negotiations with the three actively functioning private labs that are authorised to conduct the test in the state. In Gurugram, some of the samples collected by the health team were initially sent to these private labs for testing. The Haryana Medical Services Corporation Limited (HMSCL) fixed the prices, stating Rs 2500 will be charged per sample if the health department collects the sample and uses its own transportation to deliver it to the lab.In case, the sample is collected by the staff at Civil Hospital but it is picked up by the private labs, which includes their logistics, testing and reporting, the price will increase to Rs 3200. It will further increase to Rs 3950, if the sample collection, logistics, testing and reporting is done by the private lab all by itself. These rates have been fixed as one-third for screening and two-thirds for confirmatory test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/cost-of-covid-19-tests-in-haryana-capped-at-2-400/story-nV3Zp17nRYXgI7jRi0zf9J.html
20-06-2020||Delhi||Tablighi Jamaat case: 12 more charge sheets against foreigners||The Delhi Police on Friday filed 12 charge sheets against foreigners who had gathered at the Nizamuddin Markaz—which was one of the first Covid-19 hot spots in the national capital—taking the total number of charge sheets (comprising nearly 50,000 pages) filed against foreigners to 59. The dozen charge sheets on Friday were filed against 41 foreigners who belong to 12 different countries. In all, so far, 956 foreigners belonging to 36 different countries—mainly Indonesia, Kyrgyzstan and Malaysia—have been charged by the police till date.A statement issued by the police on Friday said that none of these foreigners have been arrested so far and they are staying at various places in Delhi that have been approved by the High Court. “The court has fixed June 25 and July 9 and 16 for further proceedings in the case,” the police statement read.The crime branch registered the FIR against the foreigners on March 31 after the station house officer of the Nizamuddin police station filed a complaint alleging violations of various government orders and directions by the management of the Markaz.The FIR was registered under the Epidemic Diseases Act, the Disaster Management Act and the Indian Penal Code which include the stringent sections of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and criminal conspiracy.The people named in the FIR include Tablighi Jamaat chief Maulana Saad and six other top officials of the religious sect on March 31 for defying a series of government directives, which curbed religious and large gatherings to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the national capital.A religious congregation was held inside the Markaz in March, which had a gathering of around 3000 persons, including many from several countries. Saad is yet to be questioned by the police.More than 2,300 people, including foreigners, were evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters in March-end and lodged in quarantine facilities in Delhi by the authorities. In April, the religious sect’s headquarters was then the single largest hot spot across the city.The police said that all the foreign nationals have been charged with offences such as violation of visa rules, government guidelines and regulations regarding the Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act, the prohibitory orders and disobeying quarantine rules.“The government has already cancelled the visas and blacklisted those who had visited India on a tourist visa and had illegally participated in the religious congregation at the Markaz,” the police added.The first lot of 47 charge sheets against the foreigners were filed over three days between May 26 and 28.Advocate Fuzail Ayyubi, who is representing the Tablighi Jamaat, said that while “at this stage, it’s not prudent to comment on the merits of the charge sheet, nevertheless all legal options and recourses as available under the law are being considered”. “The same shall be availed as and when such an occasion arises. As far as foreigners are concerned it’s quite strange that they are being chargesheeted now since they have been coming here for this purpose on the strength of the same visa for years,” Ayyubi said.“As per the law, there is no prohibition against any foreigner visiting any mosque in our country as such,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/tablighi-jamaat-case-12-more-charge-sheets-against-foreigners/story-90lxYh3DAxJMf4duYGHnFJ.html
20-06-2020||Noida||Environmentalists object to laser shows in medicine park, Sector 91||Residents and environmental activists across the city are objecting to the Noida Authority’s plan to go ahead with laser shows at the Medicinal and Herbal Park in Sector 91. Preparation for the show, which is supposed to start on August 15 will begin from Monday, said officials of Noida Authority. A similar show in Meghdootam Park in Sector 50 was cancelled in February after residents had cited ecological damage as a reason and started a petition for the same.Residents and environmental activists plan to write to the state chief minister and the home minister to postpone the installation of equipment in the medicine park, citing issues related to ecological damage and social distancing“Social distancing will be difficult to achieve when a large number of people assemble for the show. Even though the lockdown is being withdrawn in a staggered manner, caution is still encouraged. One should practise physical distancing and avoid non-essential activities. There is no need for a large gathering now. Even regular visitors to parks are taking precautions. The laser shows are ill-timed and should be postponed,” said Nisha Rai, an environmental activist from Noida.Another environmentalist Vinod Agagrwal said, “There were multiple sites selected for these laser shows, including the Noida Gate, Meghdootam Park, etc. In Sector 50, there are several high-rises surrounding the park which itself has a limited space for gathering. There were risks involved and the show was shelved. While the Sector 91 park, which covers an area of 144 acres, is still larger, it will negatively affect the ecological habitat of the birds and insects in the park. In the latest master plan, it has been designated as a recreational area. While attracting tourists is understandable but it should not be done at the cost harming the natural ecosystem of the park. Having a large gathering of spectators especially in the evening will have negative repercussions on the ecology of the area.”Officials from the Noida Authority, however, said that the sites were selected only after careful consideration. “The ecological concerns cited by the environmentalists are misleading. No animals will be harmed because of the laser shows. The civil work on the project will start soon,” said Gaurav Bansal, executive engineer, project in-charge of the laser shows.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/environmentalists-object-to-laser-shows-in-medicine-park-sector-91/story-jl8p6X48BQbNghK9YJRZ8M.html

Lt Col Pannu takes on vRAAM 2020||The Race Across America (RAAM) is an endurance feat that has steadily seen a growing number of Indian athletes participate each year.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the 2020 event is now the Virtual Race Across America (vRAAM), which will be conducted from June 16-28.The announcement brought great relief to Lt Col Bharat Kumar Pannu, who was to take part in the event. Now, Lt Col Pannu will cycle 5,000km in 12 days, with a cumulative elevation climb of 73,500 metres, all on a stationary bicycle in Pimple Nilakh, Pune.“I am all set to ride on a stationary bike integrated with the online application FulGaz,” said Lt Col Pannu, who could not take part in RAAM 2019 due to a fractured right collar bone.Lt Col Pannu is based at the Army’s aviation unit in Bengaluru, but chose to ride the vRAAM from Pune, where he landed in on Saturday evening. Lt Col Pannu has been training indoors since April.“I have a very old connection with Pune. Of my eight-member team, six are from Pune, and one each from Nashik and Mumbai. Calling all of them to Bengaluru was risky, so I decided to come here,” said Lt Col Pannu who had completed solo cycling expedition from Kashmir to Kanyakumari (K2K) in 8 Days 09 Hours and 48 minutes in October 2019.Pannu’s vRAAM attempt is dedicated to raising awareness and funds for supporting the education of the children of domestic helps in Pune, through an NGO called Punarjanmam.“The situation has become worse due to coronavirus and I will appeal to people, via social media, to support my cause,” added the 37-year-old Pannu, who hails from Rohtak, Haryana.Darshan Dubey, the crew chief, says, “We were disappointed when we first got the news, as the whole plan was to go to the US and be a part of RAAM, but now we are excited with the alternate option. vRAAM will have its own set of challenges for which the whole team is prepared.”Team will be working in a group of four in 12-hour shifts.What is RAAMRace Across America is a race where the cyclist covers 3,000 miles, across 12 states.

20-06-2020||World||Pompeo says UN vote on race, policing in US is ‘hypocrisy’||US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Saturday a UN Human Rights Council vote condemning racism amounted to hypocrisy.“The council’s decision to vote yesterday on a resolution focusing on policing and race in the US marks a new low,” Pompeo said in a statement.The council took the vote after a debate prompted by protests in the US triggered by the death at police hands of African American George Floyd. However, a specific mention of racism and police brutality in the US was removed.This sparked outrage from rights groups, which accused Washington and its allies of lobbying heavily to revise the text -- a charge to which the US mission in Geneva declined to respond.The United States, which had complained of being singled out in the initial text, withdrew from the council in 2018 and was not present on Friday.In his statement Saturday, titled “On the Hypocrisy of UN Human Rights Council,” Pompeo said discussion in the US about race following the death of Floyd “is a sign of our democracy’s strength and maturity.”“If the Council were serious about protecting human rights, there are plenty of legitimate needs for its attention, such as the systemic racial disparities in places like Cuba, China and Iran,” he said.“If the Council were honest, it would recognize the strengths of American democracy and urge authoritarian regimes around the world to model American democracy and to hold their nations to the same high standards of accountability and transparency that we Americans apply to ourselves,” Pompeo added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-says-un-vote-on-race-policing-in-us-is-hypocrisy/story-dOrCBIh5HcBmws0xo3td5N.html
20-06-2020||World||Thousands headed to indoor Trump’s Tulsa rally, raising coronavirus fears||Tens of thousands of people from many states are converging on Tulsa for an indoor rally and other campaign events Saturday for President Donald Trump, raising concerns that the gatherings could help fuel nascent spikes of coronavirus cases in many places.State and city health department officials were already bracing for a possible surge in COVID-19 cases from large outdoor demonstrations against police brutality held across the country. Now the Trump rally — at an indoor arena that can hold 19,000 people and is expected to be at capacity — is shaping up to be the first indoor event of such a massive scale since the coronavirus pandemic took hold and many states issued stay-at-home orders. Tulsa has seen the largest increase in cases in Oklahoma in recent days, and several bordering states, including Arkansas, have seen spikes in community spread of the virus in recent weeks.“I think there’s no question that indoor events are more risky than outdoor events. But we don’t really know how big that difference is. And certainly other aspects, like how tightly packed things are ... will make a big difference,” said Justin Lessler, an associate professor of epidemiology at John Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.Lessler said large events like the rally or the protests have the “potential to be super spreader events,” but their potential to drive the pandemic is short-lived.“The larger factor is what happens when people go home,” he said. “If everybody goes home and doesn’t respect the social distancing factors and goes out into the community, then they could push the spread.”Tulsa County health officials have said they are particularly concerned about the event at the BOK Center because of a recent spike in cases: Oklahoma set a high for new cases last Thursday, with 450, and Tulsa saw 125 new cases Friday. Other health experts are worried that attendees could unknowingly take the virus back to their respective hometowns and states, seeding additional outbreaks.The Trump campaign acknowledged the risk in a waiver it asked attendees to sign that absolves them of any responsibility if someone should get sick. It has said it will hand out masks and hand sanitizer, but there is no requirement that participants use them. Attendees will also undergo a temperature check, but there will be no required social distancing at the indoor event expected to be at capacity.Trump also plans an outdoor event, and officials are expecting about 100,000 people to converge on the city.The rally comes a day after the head of the World Health Organization warned that the pandemic is “accelerating.” Outbreaks in the Americas were of particular concern, with Brazil surpassing 1 million confirmed infections, second only to the United States.Meanwhile, health officials are still eyeing the outdoor demonstrations against police brutality sparked by the death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis. Those have gathered thousands of people together, in many instances not adhering to social-distancing recommendations or wearing masks. States and cities have not yet reported large upticks in virus cases since the protests began at the end of May, but it was unclear whether protesters have been seeking tests in large numbers or are self-quarantining after the events.California health officials have reported so far only a few people attending the demonstrations have tested positive for COVID-19, but contact tracing anyone they have infected is proving to be futile. During such tracing, ideally, a person who tests positive can provide names and contact information for people who had been around them — something that is proving difficult with strangers gathered by a moving protest.Health officials in Los Angeles County, Philadelphia and other cities where large demonstrations have been happening, including several Friday in honor of Juneteenth, have urged those attending to get tested or to consider self-quarantining for 14 days if they were around people without masks for as little as 15 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-headed-to-indoor-trump-s-tulsa-rally-raising-coronavirus-fears/story-TrmBKATjfl3VobozedGtJK.html
20-06-2020||World||Metal barriers, Trump gear: Crowd readies for Tulsa rally||Supporters of President Donald Trump were lining up Saturday outside metal barriers surrounding the Tulsa stadium where the president will hold his first rally in months, ready to welcome him back to the campaign trail despite warnings from health officials about the coronavirus.The crowd — including some who have have camped near the venue since early in the week — were hoping to be among the first inside the more than 19,000-seat BOK Center for what is expected to be the biggest indoor event the country has seen since restrictions to prevent the Covid-19 virus began in March. Trump also will speak at an outdoor event to be held inside the barriers.Protests also are planned for Saturday, and some Black leaders in Tulsa have said they’re worried the visit could lead to violence. It’s happening amid protests over racial injustice and policing across the U.S. and in a city that has a long history of racial tension. Officials said they expected some 100,000 people in Tulsa’s downtown.Renee Lamoreaux, a retiree and Trump supporter from Tulsa, said Friday that police officers had briefed ralliers, saying the event would basically be in a “big cage,” and the rest of the world would be outside. She said she felt reassured.Tulsa has seen cases of Covid-19 spike in the past week, and the local health department director asked that the rally be postponed. But Republican Gov. Kevin Stitt said it would be safe. The Oklahoma Supreme Court on Friday denied a request that everyone attending the indoor rally wear a mask, and few in the crowd outside Saturday were wearing them.The Trump campaign said it will hand out masks and hand sanitizer, but there is no requirement that participants use them. Participants will also undergo a temperature check.The rally originally was planned for Friday, but was moved after complaints that it coincided with Juneteenth, which marks the end of slavery in the U.S., and in a city that was the cite of a 1921 race-related massacre, when a white mob attacked Blacks, leaving as many as 300 people dead.Stitt said he will join Vice President Mike Pence for a meeting Saturday with Black leaders from Tulsa’s Greenwood District, the area where the 1921 attack occurred. Stitt initially invited Trump to tour the area, but said, “We talked to the African American community and they said it would not be a good idea, so we asked the president not to do that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/metal-barriers-trump-gear-crowd-readies-for-tulsa-rally/story-P1YVV2366ADqCAjT3XhuWI.html
20-06-2020||World||Pompeo blames China for border clashes with India, calls it ‘rogue actor’||US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo has blamed China for escalating tensions along the border with India and called it a “rogue actor” in the neighborhood and indicated he may have raised the dispute and other such flashpoints in his meeting with his Chinese counterpart Yang Jiechi earlier in the week. “The PLA has escalated border tensions – we see it today in India, the world’s most popular – populous democracy.,” Pompeo said referring to the People’s Liberation Army, the Chinese military. “And we watch as it militarizes the South China Sea and illegally claims more territory there, threatening vital sea lanes, a promise they broke again”“But the CCP isn’t just a rogue actor in its own neighborhood,” he added, referring this time to the Chinese Communist Party by its initials. “If it was, we might think differently about it. It impacts us all. “The top US diplomat was participating in a virtual conference of the Copenhagen Democracy Summit on Friday.Pompeo went on to say, in response to a question about his meeting with Yang, “What I spent a good deal of my time speaking with Yang Jiechi about was the fundamental idea that we’re just watching actions. It’s no longer enough to listen to what the Chinese Communist Party is saying. We can see their actions. I ticked through a few of them: Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, what they’re doing in India, what they’ve done in the economic zones along the Philippines and Malaysia and Indonesia and Vietnam, the coercion on Australia – when they had the audacity to demand that there would be an investigation of how this virus got from Wuhan to Milan, how this virus got from Wuhan to Tehran, how this virus got from Wuhan to Oklahoma City, and to Belgium and to Spain, and decimating the global economy.”The readout issued of the meeting by the state department had did not have such granular details. But, again, it was not explicit from Pompeo’s remarks at the virtual conference if he did indeed bring up the India-China border clashes specifically or in a general way, covering all of China’s aggressive actions.Tensions between the United States and China have escalated significantly after the Covid-19 outbreak,. The Trump administration has sought to tie to China accusing it of not alerting the rest of the world on time and then by providing incorrect and misleading information about it. Pompeo calls it the Wuhan virus, after the city where it started. And President Donald Trump had called the “Chinese Virus”, “plague” and “gift” from China.There is very little patience for China in the United States, which made very clear its support for India in the ongoing border dispute with India form the early days. In May, Alice Wells, the former top diplomat for South and Central Asia had said the border flareups “were reminder that Chinese aggression is not always just rhetorical. We continue to see provocations and disturbing behavior by China that raises questions about how China wants to use its rising power”.President Trump had offered to mediate subsequently, late May, but was turned down by both India and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pompeo-blames-china-for-border-clashes-with-india-calls-it-rogue-actor/story-ZEBvjPMQY93mMfIdoTlB7L.html
20-06-2020||World||Tayyip Erdogan says Turkey lost ground in coronavirus fight||President Tayyip Erdogan said on Saturday Turkey had lost some ground in its battle with the coronavirus but a focus on hygiene, masks and social distancing will protect people and help the economy rebound in the second half of the year. This month, Ankara opened restaurants and cafes and lifted weekend stay-home orders and most intercity travel bans. But since June 1 new Covid-19 cases have doubled to nearly 1,600 per day, raising concerns of a re-emergence. “The numbers in recent days show that we have lost our position in the fight against the epidemic,” Erdogan said in a televised address. “But we aim to remove the pandemic from our agenda by respecting the cleaning, mask and distance rules.” As Turks have poured out into streets, parks, malls and to vacation spots, face masks were made compulsory in major cities on Thursday. On Friday new virus cases dipped to just over 1,200 with total cases at more than 185,000, the thirteenth highest in the world. A separate general lockdown of several hours was imposed Saturday so students could go out to attend high school exams. Some Turks posted pictures on social media of tightly packed crowds near schools and criticised the decision to hold tests. “Take a good look at these photos ... shame,” said one on Twitter. A week ago, Turkey’s top medical association criticised the decision to ease restrictions too soon.Health and government officials have told Reuters a harder line on social distancing may be adopted even while they said there is no plan to slow the economy, which emerged this month from a near standstill since mid-March. Most economists expect Turkey’s economy to contract this year. But Erdogan said economic recovery signals have been “quite strong” since May, adding “we expect great momentum from the second half of the year.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tayyip-erdogan-says-turkey-lost-ground-in-coronavirus-fight/story-UAijNK8ug94y4D6tlgLXhO.html
20-06-2020||World||China unveils new security law for Hong Kong, will supersede local laws||China on Saturday unveiled details of the controversial new security law for Hong Kong amid international criticism that it will corrode the wide-ranging freedoms enjoyed by residents of the global financial hub.Details of the new law as listed by official news agency, Xinhua, includes setting up of a national security office for Hong Kong to handle crimes against national security.The local government must establish new institutions to protect national security and allow mainland agencies to operate in the city “when needed”.Carrie Lam, Hong Kong’s chief executive, will have the power to appoint judges to hear cases related to national security. The bottom line is clear, however.According to Xinhua: “For Hong Kong laws that are not in line with this [impending national security] law, this law’s requirements will apply, and the right to interpret this law lies with the National People’s Congress Standing Committee.”National security activities would protect human rights and freedom of speech and assembly, it added, without providing details.The Xinhua’s statement said that the legislation would make it clear that the Hong Kong government would need to respect and protect human rights as it safeguarded national security.“It must protect the freedoms of expression, the press, publication, association, assembly … that Hong Kong people enjoy under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights,” it said.“Under Beijing’s plan, the Standing Committee will create a law for Hong Kong to prohibit acts of succession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign and external influences to threaten national security,’’ the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post said in a report on Saturday.Critics of the new law say it essentially ends the unique system of governance under the “one country, two systems” mechanism which has governed Hong Kong since the British handed it over to China in 1997.“This is the death knell for Hong Kong, make no mistake of it, this is the end of ‘one country, two systems’, the Hong Kong that we loved, a free Hong Kong,” pro-democracy lawmaker from Hong Kong Dennis Kwok was quoted by agencies as telling reporters on May 28 when the NPC had passed the security legislation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-unveils-new-security-law-for-hong-kong-will-supersede-local-laws/story-XlvhahTHIJ1QsgZH5aK7cJ.html
20-06-2020||World||US Embassy in Kabul battling Covid-19 infections||The US State Department says Covid-19 infections have been reported at its embassy in the Afghan capital and the staff who are affected include diplomats, contractors and locally employed staff.The State Department did not say how many were affected. An official at the embassy in Kabul, who could not be identified because of not being authorized to talk to the media, said as many as 20 people were infected, the majority of whom are Nepalese Gurkhas, who provide embassy security.“The embassy is implementing all appropriate measures to mitigate the spread of Covid-19,” the U.S. State department said.The infected staff are in isolation in the embassy while the remainder on the compound are being tested, said the embassy official, who also said the embassy staff have been told they can expect tighter isolation orders.Afghanistan has 28,424 confirmed coronavirus cases. International aid organizations monitoring the pandemic’s spread in the country say the numbers are much higher because of a lack of testing capabilities as well as access to testing. They also fear the highly contagious disease has spread throughout the country with the return of more than 200,000 Afghans from Iran, the hardest hit country in the region. Iran has recorded more than 200,000 cases and 9,392 deaths.Few of the Afghans who returned from Iran were tested before they fanned out across the country to their homes.Earlier this month the International Rescue Committee warned Afghanistan was on the brink of a humanitarian disaster mostly because the government does not have the capacity to even test 80% of coronavirus cases.Until now a handful of NATO troops have also tested positive for the infection.At the US Embassy, the State Department said a sanitization of the premises was being carried out to “prevent further outbreak.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-embassy-in-kabul-battling-covid-19-infections/story-bp1KQVaHYeICRLds9PxiCJ.html
20-06-2020||World||WHO warns of ‘new, dangerous coronavirus phase’, Brazil, Europe pass bleak milestones||The coronavirus pandemic has passed grim milestones as Brazil confirmed one million infections and Europe chalked up more than 2.5 million Saturday as the World Health Organization warned of a “new and dangerous phase”.Death tolls in Colombia and Mexico also made grim reading -- passing 2,000 and 20,000, respectively -- as the virus tightened its grip in the Americas.Although the spread has slowed in Europe, it is still the worst-affected continent -- almost half of its 2.5 million cases being registered in Russia, Britain, Spain and Italy, according to an AFP tally on Saturday.The continent is easing its way out of strict lockdowns that have caused crippling economic damage, but the WHO warned against giving in to isolation fatigue.The virus has now killed more than 458,000 people and infected 8.6 million worldwide.A vaccine remains months off at best despite several trials, and scientists are still making daily discoveries about the virus, its symptoms and the extent to which it may have spread before being identified.- ‘Still spreading fast’ -Brazil reported a one-day record of nearly 55,000 infections on Friday, becoming the second country to pass one million cases after the United States -- the only country with higher numbers of deaths and cases.The health ministry said the jump was caused by “instability” in its reporting system, which delayed previous days’ figures for some states.Brazil’s death toll now stands at nearly 49,000, and has risen by more than 1,000 each of the past four days -- although its curve finally appears to be starting to flatten.Authorities in Mexico City meanwhile pushed back a planned reopening of the economy from next week to the following week, saying the rate of infection was still too high.Argentina, which is reeling from the economic impact of the health crisis, bought more time to negotiate a $66 billion debt restructuring with creditors, who agreed to extend the deadline once again, to July 24.“The world is in a new and dangerous phase,” WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual press conference.“Many people are understandably fed up with being at home... but the virus is still spreading fast.”- ‘I cried with joy’ -In Europe, researchers in Italy said they had found evidence the virus was present in December -- about the same time the disease was first reported in China.They discovered genetic traces in samples of waste water collected in several cities, the ISS institute said.Italy confirmed its first cases in February and imposed a strict lockdown in March.Much of the continent followed Italy into lockdown and shops, restaurants and other businesses have only slowly reopened. Millions of children in France are preparing to return to school on Monday after three months away.“I cried with joy when I got the confirmation from the teacher that my two children would be going back to school full time,” said Noemie from Nice.France is also reopening cinemas from Monday and stadiums for team sports, and in another sign of returning normality, actors have also started kissing again on film shoots.“No, the kiss is not finished,” French Culture Minister Franck Riester declared when asked if social distancing was in danger of killing off love scenes.But Asian countries continue to provide cautionary tales -- China being the latest nation to have eased restrictions after controlling the virus, only to find itself battling a new outbreak.The cluster, linked to a wholesale market in Beijing, has sparked a nationwide campaign to inspect food imports after officials suggested imported frozen food could be to blame.- Trump hits campaign trail -The United States has the highest death toll by far, at more than 119,000, and the world’s largest economy is taking a beating in a year when President Donald Trump seeks re-election.However, the president has been consistently critical of lockdown measures and plans to hold his first mass rally in months later on Saturday.Some 19,000 people are expected to attend the event, where they will be required to sign a disclaimer to ensure the president will not be held liable if they contract the virus.“My campaign hasn’t started yet. It starts on Saturday night in Oklahoma!” Trump tweeted before the rally in Tulsa, which has been widely derided by his opponents.One supporter, who gave her name as Jody while waiting in line with her five-year-old son dressed as a mini-Trump, said she would be wearing a mask but expected that many others would not.“I wish people would wear them, but you can’t force people to do something they don’t want to do,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-warns-of-new-dangerous-coronavirus-phase-brazil-europe-pass-bleak-milestones/story-HVuRItlbYy5PtfowB0GsnO.html
20-06-2020||World||UK’s Rishi Sunak sees ‘enormous difference’ after social distance review||British finance minister Rishi Sunak signalled that the government is poised to relax its two-metre social distancing rule for England which businesses have said in its current form would slow their recovery from the coronavirus lockdown.A review of the two-metre rule would be concluded next week, Sunak told BBC television on Saturday, adding: “Obviously that is something that will make an enormous difference, I think, to many businesses who are keen to see a change.”“Obviously, we need to go through that review but I am very understanding of the calls for action on that.”Many employers, especially in the hospitality and leisure sectors, have said the rule that people must remain two metres apart will stop them from getting back up to speed as the coronavirus lockdown is lifted.Sunak said he understood how the rule was affecting the ability of pubs, restaurants and other hospitality firms to reopen.“I can’t pre-empt the findings of that review but suffice to say we have made really good progress over the past few months in tackling this virus and we all want to see our pubs and our restaurants spring back to life,” he said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who announced the review a week ago, has said he will do everything he can to get the country back to normal as soon as possible without risking lives. The review applies to England as Britain’s devolved nations - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - have their own powers over health rules. Johnson has come under heavy criticism for his handling of the pandemic. Britain has the third highest number of coronavirus deaths after the United States and Brazil.Johnson, who says the government has followed scientific advice in its approach, has to balance the need to revive the economy after its 20% collapse in April without allowing a resurgence in cases.Britain’s retail sector has already been allowed to re-open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-s-rishi-sunak-sees-enormous-difference-after-social-distance-review/story-gCKABwX9epwH1LFlV9pLxN.html
20-06-2020||World||Pope Francis hails Italy coronavirus doctors, nurses as heroes||Pope Francis welcomed doctors and nurses from the coronavirus-ravaged region of Lombardy to the Vatican on Saturday to thank them for their selfless work and “heroic” sacrifice.Francis dedicated one of his first post-lockdown audiences to Italy’s front-line medical and civil protection personnel, telling the delegation that their example of professional competence and compassion would help Italy forge a new future of hope and solidarity.The northern region of Lombardy, Italy’s financial and industrial capital, was the hardest-hit region in the onetime European epicenter of the pandemic. Lombardy has counted more than 92,000 of Italy’s 232,000 official infections and half of the country’s 34,500 dead.Francis noted that some of those dead were the doctors and nurses themselves, and said Italy would remember them with “prayer and gratitude.” More than 40 nurses and 160 doctors died during the outbreak nationwide, and nearly 30,000 health care personnel were infected.Francis said Lombardy’s medics and nurses became literal “angels” helping the sick recover or accompanying them to their death, given their family members were prevented from visiting them in the hospital.Speaking off the cuff, Francis praised the “little gestures of creativity of love” they provided: a caress or the use of their cell phone “to bring together the old person who was about to die with his son or daughter to say goodbye, to see them for the last time...”“This was so good for all of us: testimony of proximity and tenderness,” Francis said.In the audience were the bishops of some of the hardest-hit cities in Lombardy, as well as representatives of Italy’s civil protection agency, which coordinated the emergency response and built field hospitals around the region. They sat well-spaced apart and wore protective masks in the frescoed audience hall in the Apostolic Palace.The pope said he hoped Italy would emerge morally and spiritually stronger from the emergency and the lesson of interconnection that it taught: that individual and collective interests are intertwined.“It’s easy to forget that we need one another, someone to take care of us and give us courage,” he said.The encounter was only the second time Francis has welcomed a group into the Vatican for an audience since the Vatican locked down in early March along with the rest of Italy to try to contain the virus. The first was a small encounter May 20 with a group of athletes who are raising money for hospitals in two hard-hit Lombardy cities, Brescia and Bergamo.At the end of the audience, Francis made sure that the doctors and nurses kept their distance, telling them he would come to them rather than have them line up to greet him and kiss his ring, as was the Vatican’s pre-pandemic practice.“We have to be obedient to the dispositions” of social distancing, he said.Lombardy’s governor, Attilio Fontana, who headed the delegation, invited Francis to visit Lombardy so he could also bring words of hope and consolation to those who are still sick, and to the families who lost loved ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-hails-italy-coronavirus-doctors-nurses-as-heroes/story-AQlG7NHkbHE5NN0Wr5dIVI.html
20-06-2020||World||Pakistan registers record single-day Covid-19 deaths, cases cross 171,000||Pakistan on Saturday reported 153 coronavirus deaths, the highest spike in a single-day in the country, while the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases crossed the 171,000-mark, health officials said.According to the Ministry of National Health Services, the total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in Pakistan rose to 171,665 after 6,604 new infections were recorded in the last 24 hours. The total death toll stands at 3,382 after 153 more deaths were registered.The ministry said that 63,504 people have recovered so far across Pakistan, making it a significant count. Out of the total infection so far, Sindh has 65,163, Punjab 64,216, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa 20,790, Islamabad 10,279, Balochistan 9,162, Gilgit Baltistan 1,253 and Pakistan-occupied Kashmir 803 infected patients.There are 810 hospitals with Covid-19 facilities, with 6,980 patients admitted across the country, according to the ministry.Meanwhile, Pakistan’s aviation ministry on Friday said that the international flight operations in the country will resume from Saturday after nearly three months.The aviation said that the permission for international flight operations would be subject to restrictions in light of the current Covid-19 scenario and implementation of health protocols.“Government of Pakistan has been pleased to authorise International Flight Operations to/ from All International Airports of Pakistan except Gwadar and Turbat airports, with effect from June 20, 2020, 0001 PST,” according to the statement by the aviation ministry.The cargo, special and diplomatic flights would continue to be authorised as per procedure in vogue and adherence to the relevant applicable standard operating procedures would be mandatory for all airline operators.The government on Wednesday announced a new policy for inbound passengers with a resolve to transport approximately 200,000 people within a month, the Dawn newspaper reported.The implementation of the new policy will start from Saturday which the government said would bring significant enhancement in the capacity to bring back stranded Pakistanis from across the world.On March 21, Pakistan suspended all international flight operations to stem the spread of the coronavirus pandemic in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-registers-record-single-day-covid-19-deaths-cases-cross-171-000/story-7zSyqMQb2mVQkJwTNQsfmI.html

20-06-2020||World||Beijing sees drop in coronavirus cases, Brazil passes 1 million-mark||China’s capital recorded a further drop in coronavirus cases amid tightened containment measures, while Brazil surpassed 1 million confirmed infections, second only to the United States.Europe, in contrast, continues to emerge warily from lockdown, with hard-hit Britain considering easing social distancing rules to make it easier for restaurants, pubs and schools to reopen.Officials reported 22 new cases in Beijing on Saturday, along with five others elsewhere in China. There were no new deaths and 308 people remained hospitalized for treatment.South Korea recorded 67 new cases, the largest 24-hour increase in about three weeks. Most of them come from the densely populated Seoul area, where about half of the country’s 51 million people reside. Many cases have been linked to exposure in nightlife outlets.The head of the World Health Organization said Friday that the pandemic is “accelerating” and that more than 150,000 cases were reported the day before — the highest single-day number so far.Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters in Geneva that nearly half of the newly reported cases were from the Americas, with significant numbers from South Asia and the Middle East.Brazil’s Health Ministry said the total number of cases had risen by more than 50,000 from the previous day. President Jair Bolsonaro still downplays the risks of the virus after nearly 50,000 fatalities in three months, saying the impact of social isolation on Brazil’s economy could be more deadly.The new coronavirus has infected more than 8.5 million people worldwide and killed more than 454,000, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University. The actual number is thought to be much higher because many cases are asymptomatic or go untested.South Africa and Ethiopia say they are recommending the limited use of the commonly available steroid dexamethasone for all COVID-19 patients on ventilators or supplementary oxygen. In a British trial, the drug was shown to significantly improve survival chances for the most seriously ill.South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said “this breakthrough is excellent news for us and we are especially fortunate that it came as we are preparing for our upcoming surge” in cases. South Africa has about 30% of the virus cases on the African continent, or more than 87,000.South Africa continues to loosen lockdown measures under economic pressure, despite reporting nearly 4,000 more COVID-19 cases on Saturday. Casinos, beauty salons and sit-down restaurant service are among the latest permitted activities as the country eases one of the world’s strictest lockdowns.Britain lowered its coronavirus threat level one notch, becoming the latest country to claim it’s getting a national outbreak under control.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government says it will announce next week whether it will ease social distancing rules that say people should remain 2 meters (6½ feet) apart. Business groups are lobbying for that to be cut to 1 meter (3 feet) to help restart the country’s economy.While many stores in Britain have reopened, pubs, hotels and restaurants won’t be allowed to restart until July 4 at the soonest. Proposals to allow them to reopen safely include pubs having people order pints using phone apps rather than going to the bar.The U.K. has suffered Europe’s deadliest coronavirus outbreak, with more than 42,000 confirmed fatalitiesMeanwhile, Germany reported the country’s highest daily increase in virus cases in a month after managing to contain its outbreak better than comparable large European nations.French authorities are keeping a close eye on signs of an accelerating spread of the coronavirus in Normandy, a region that’s until now been spared the worst of the outbreak that has hit Paris and the east of France particularly hard.The emergencies chief of the World Health Organization has confirmed that China shared coronavirus sequences from its latest outbreak with the global community and says it appears the virus was imported to Beijing from strains circulating in Europe.At a press briefing on Friday, Dr. Michael Ryan noted that “strains and viruses have moved around the world” throughout the pandemic. Ryan said that many viruses in New York “were of European origin” but that doesn’t mean Europe necessarily was the original source.He said analysis of the genetic sequences so far suggests that the virus spread to people in China from other humans instead of jumping from animals directly into humans.___Lawless reported from London.

Johnson, who says his government has followed scientific advice in its handling of the pandemic, has to balance the need to revive the economy after its 20% collapse in April without allowing a resurgence in coronavirus cases.Britain has the third-highest number of coronavirus deaths after the United States and Brazil.Britain’s devolved nations - Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - have their own powers over health rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-conclude-england-s-two-metre-covid-19-rule-review-soon-says-minister/story-JOOFvKXYNYkhLPeFkrnqzJ.html
20-06-2020||World||Black Lives Matter: UK parliament to review iconic colonial India painting||A large mural painting in the UK parliament depicting a defining moment in early 17th century laying the foundation of British influence in India is being reviewed for its contemporary relevance in the context of the Black Lives Matter (BLM) campaign.The painting by noted artist William Rothenstein (1872-1945) unveiled in 1927 is one of eight depicting important historical events as part of ‘The Building of Britain’ series in St Stephen’s Hall in the parliament complex, which has thousands of pieces of art, many with racist history.The review follows demands as part of the BLM campaign to remove statues and symbols with links to racism and slavery from public places. Campaigners have identified several statues in London and elsewhere that they want removed, with local councils across the UK initiating similar reviews.The Rothenstein painting depicts the first British diplomatic representative, Thomas Roe (1581-1644), in the court of Mughal emperor Jahangir in Ajmer in 1616. Roe was sent to India by King James I in 1614 to establish diplomatic relations with the Mughal empire.By the time Roe reached India, the East India Company (formed in December 1600) had established its first presence with a factory at Surat. Roe’s main task was to seek Jahangir’s support for this venture and negotiate a treaty enabling further trade.By the end of his period as ambassador in 1618, Roe had secured commercial access to Jahangir’s dominions, though a formal treaty was never signed. According to the British view, he succeeded “by his courtesy and firmness” at Jahangir’s court to lay the foundation of British influence in India.Senior Labour MP Virendra Sharma welcomed the painting’s review as part of the wider examination of art in the parliament complex: “Its relevance must be reviewed in the context of today’s social, political and economic climate. But it should be done in a logical way, not driven by prejudice”.Confirming that the Rothenstein painting is part of the wider review of art, a UK parliament spokesperson said: “The interpretation of the artworks is constantly under review and we will look at ways to contextualise the lives of those depicted”.“The Speaker’s Advisory Committee on Works of Art and the Lord Speaker’s Advisory Panel on Works of Art are also actively working to improve the diversity of the art collection, both in terms of the people portrayed and in the artists commissioned to ensure that the collection reflects and celebrates the diversity of all who contribute to parliament.”The Speaker’s Advisory Committee met this week and reiterated its commitment to broaden the representation of women and BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) groups. Officials said recently articulated concerns about works of art within the parliament complex are being taken “very seriously”.They said they are also reviewing information the UK parliament provides online ensure its correct context, besides exploring other ways of disseminating information, such as through printed information given to visitors (leaflets) and via parliament’s social media channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-lives-matter-uk-parliament-to-review-iconic-colonial-india-painting/story-ON2DyEMr5gVeghZdhla7BP.html
20-06-2020||World||PM Trudeau ‘disappointed’ over detention of 2 Canadians by China||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has expressed disappointment over the decision by Chinese authorities to foist espionage charges against two Canadians, including a former diplomat, who have been detained in China for over 550 days.Trudeau’s statement was followed by the country’s Foreign Minister François-Philippe Champagne calling for the immediate release of Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, asserting they had been “arbitrarily detained.”Their arrests have been deemed by analysts as hostage diplomacy undertaken by Beijing, as the moves followed the detention of a senior executive of the Chinese telecom firm Huawei in Vancouver in 2018. That executive, Meng Wanzhou, was arrested in December 2018 and is on trial for a case related to fraud that could ultimately lead to her extradition to the United States. She also happens to be the daughter of Huawei’s founder.“We will continue to use all of our expertise to return these two Michaels to Canada,” Trudeau said in response to a question during his daily media briefing in Ottawa.Canada’s Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland was somewhat more outspoken in her reaction, as she said she was “very angry” at the Chinese action In charging the two with espionage. “Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor are two very great Canadians who are behaving incredibly decent in the difficult circumstances that they have been placed in and absolutely at no fault of their own,” she said during a media interaction, according to the outlet Global News.In a statement, the International Crisis Group, where Kovrig worked as a senior adviser, blasted the Chinese prosecution, stating, “This is yet another arbitrary and baseless step in a case that has been arbitrary and baseless from day one.”Canada’s Foreign Minister said the cases of Kovrig and Spavor “remain a top priority for the Government of Canada.” He also expressed concern over how they were since China has denied Canada consular access since January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-trudeau-disappointed-over-detention-of-2-canadians-by-china/story-RcO0bhCKFsV2IJTH4gJJGJ.html
20-06-2020||World||New railway line in Tibet will reach Arunachal doorstep in 2021||China is building infrastructure at a rapid speed and encouraging wealthier provinces to make critical investments along the border areas of Tibet with Arunachal Pradesh.On Saturday, state-owned companies completed part of a key railway bridge on the Yarlung Tsangpo, which flows into India as Siang and then Brahmaputra river, barely 30 km from the border with Arunachal Pradesh.It is part of the 435-km railway project linking Lhasa and Nyingchi, also known as Linzhi, in southwest China’s Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR).Experts say once completed, it will be a “dual use” – civil and military – bridge reaching until the terminus of the line is likely to be just across the border of Arunachal Pradesh, which China claims is part of south Tibet.The Zang Mu Yarlung Tsangpo river double-lane bridge is over 525 metres long and is a key bridge in the project.It is located across the Yarlung between mountains on both sides.On April 7, China’s official media announced that construction work on the last two of the 47 tunnels on the 435-km railway was completed.At least 75 percent of the Lhasa-Nyingchi railway comprises bridges and tunnels, and over 90 percent of the railway is on the Tibetan plateau at over 3,000 metres or more than 15000 feet above sea level.“As Tibet’s first electric railway, it has a designed speed of 160 km per hour.Over 20,000 builders have been working on the railway since the end of 2014. It is expected to be completed and put into operation in 2021.China has also built a network of highways across TAR with links to Nyingchi.In 2018, it opened a 409-km new expressway costing about $5.8 billion linking Lhasa with Nyingchi.The expressway cuts Lhasa-Nyingchi travel time from eight to five hours at a speed limit of 80 km per hour.The TAR’s airport infrastructure has rapidly improved as well.By the end of 2019, the region had five airports and 11 airlines operating a total of 101 routes, enabling convenient connections between Tibet and 51 cities.As part of a broader policy, Beijing has also begun to encourage wealthier Chinese provinces to invest in TAR, especially in border areas like Nyingchi.Less than two weeks ago, 26 construction projects in sectors like infrastructure, public services and tourism were officially launched in Nyingchi to be sponsored by southern China’s industrial powerhouse, the province of Guangdong.For 2020, Guangdong has planned 51 projects in Nyingchi with a total investment of 543 million yuan or around $78 million.Poverty alleviation is part of President Xi Jinping’s plan to encourage Tibetan herders to settle down in remote locations close to the Arunachal Pradesh border.Xi had written a letter to a herding family in Lhunze County in southwest China’s TAR to set down roots in the border area, safeguard the Chinese territory and develop their hometown in 2017.In the letter, Xi thanked them for the loyalty and contributions they have made to safeguard the border area. “Without the peace in the territory, there will be no peaceful lives for the millions of families,” he wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-railway-line-in-tibet-will-reach-arunachal-doorstep-in-2021/story-fT9mBNIozkqCqLXfcPD67L.html
20-06-2020||World||No mention of Hong Kong security law as China closes meeting||The body that handles most lawmaking for China’s top legislative body closed its latest meeting Saturday with no mention of passing a highly controversial national security law for Hong Kong.The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress dealt with numerous agenda items but said nothing about the fate of the security legislation that has been strongly criticized as undermining the semi-autonomous territory’s legal and political institutions, China’s official Xinhua News Agency reported.The bill was submitted Thursday for deliberation, covering four categories of crimes: succession, subversion of state power, local terrorist activities and collaborating with foreign or external foreign forces to endanger national security.Beijing has repeatedly said it is determined to press ahead with the legislation despite heavy criticism from within Hong Kong and abroad, including from the U.S., which says it will revoke some of the preferential conditions extended toward the city after its transfer from British to Chinese rule in 1997.Britain has said it will offer passports and a path to citizenship to as many as 3 million Hong Kong residents. Group of Seven leading economies called on China to reconsider its plans, issuing a joint statement voicing “grave concern” over the legislation that is said would breach Beijing’s international commitments as well as the territory’s constitution.Beijing has repeatedly denounced the moves as rank interference in its internal affairs.Li Zhanshu, the ruling Communist Party’s third-ranking official and head of the National People’s Congress, presided over the meeting of the Standing Committee, which handles most legislative tasks in between the annual sessions of the full and largely ceremonial congress.In its full session last month, the congress ratified a decision to enact such legislation at the national level after Hong Kong’s own Legislative Council was unable to do so because of strong local opposition. Critics say the law could severely limit free speech and opposition political activity.Legal experts say Beijing’s justifications for the law are debatable.The Hong Kong Bar Association on Friday called on the city’s government to reveal details of the bill and warned that the law’s enforcement in Hong Kong risked setting up a system of conflicting parallel legal standards dominated by Beijing.“It raises the question whether individuals will be tried within the criminal justice system in (Hong Kong) by the Hong Kong courts or sent to the Mainland for trial and serve any terms of imprisonment in Mainland prisons,” the bar association said in a statement emailed to reporters.China acted following widespread and sometimes violent anti-government protests in Hong Kong last year that Beijing saw as a dangerous campaign to split the territory from the rest of the country. Tho protests were initially spurred by opposition to proposed legislation that could have seen criminal suspects sent to the mainland for trials in China’s highly opaque legal system, along with possible torture and abuse. The extradition bill was eventually scrapped.China has sought to assuage concerns by saying the new legislation would only target “acts and activities that severely undermine national security,” according to Xinhua.The legislation is broadly seen as an additional measure further eroding the legal distinctions between Hong Kong and mainland China.Earlier this month, Hong Kong’s legislature approved a contentious bill making it illegal to insult the Chinese national anthem after pro-democracy lawmakers boycotted the vote out of protest.Senior opposition figures have also been arrested for taking part in demonstrations, and questions have arisen over whether the national security legislation will be used to disqualify pro-democracy candidates in September’s elections for the Beijing-controlled Legislative Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-mention-of-hong-kong-security-law-as-china-closes-meeting/story-difxUZ6chzfSzdQTt11T0O.html

20-06-2020||World||Greece culls migrant support groups in ‘transparency’ overhaul||Dozens of groups helping asylum seekers in Greece risk being edged out in a government move to tighten what it calls “opaque” rules overseeing charities, sparking concern that crucial support will be cut.Critics warn that the new registration regulations will downgrade services to thousands of vulnerable and traumatised people that were, in many cases, already barely adequate.“We seek as much transparency as possible in the operation of NGOs, and of people working for, or cooperating, with them,” Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said in April.Greece’s conservative government, which was voted in nearly a year ago and whose policy is to make the country a “less attractive” destination to migrants, says that new NGO registration rules are needed because the groups have run projects in the last four years “in their own way” under an “opaque” framework.But Minos Mouzourakis, legal officer for Refugee Support Aegean, is worried that the change could hamper the independent oversight role often played by NGOs. NGOs highlight abuses It is often support groups that highlight alleged abuses by coastguards or police and take legal action against the Greek state on behalf of asylum seekers, he noted.“The ministry evaluates independent organisations that often criticise it... it should not have such (powers)... it’s a question of impartiality,” he said.Mitarachi has complained that out of 1.5 billion euros ($1.7 billion) in EU support funds for Greek migration projects between 2015 and 2019, the Greek state managed just 1.9 percent.“Do you want to hand over the keys to NGOs? I don’t want that,” he told parliament this month.The new registration process includes budget scrutiny and criminal background checks for workers and volunteers. Each group’s field performance in the last two years is also probed.“This essentially helps NGOs themselves to know who is working for them,” the ministry’s asylum secretary Manos Logothetis told AFP.“Shouldn’t they know if, for instance, there is a paedophile working with minors?” he said.On Wednesday, 22 out of 40 groups active in Greek camps were eliminated from a first approval phase.Elected officials acknowledge that support groups were key at the height of Europe’s migrant crisis, especially after other EU states shut their borders in 2016 and tens of thousands of asylum seekers were trapped in Greek camps.More than a million migrants and refugees arrived in Greece in 2015 and 2016, according to the UN refugee agency. There are now around 120,000 in the country.Yiorgos Kaminis, Athens mayor in 2011-2019, has noted that “without (NGO) contribution, the incompetent Greek state would have been overwhelmed”.But, insiders have noted, there was also significant overlap.“Early on, you might have had five different groups running education programmes,” one organisation member said.According to an internal document seen by AFP, earlier this year there were more than 20 support groups in the largest Greek camp of Moria on Lesbos island.Beyond medical and legal assistance, the help offered included laundry services, self-defence and yoga, classes in Greek, English, music and IT, and pregnancy healthcare.One group handled plumbing for the heavily overcrowded camp of more than 16,000 people.It was not immediately clear how many of these organisations have been allowed to stay on.“The Greek government leads the refugee response, and the expertise and strengths of civil society and NGOs is still crucial,” the UN refugee agency’s spokesman in Greece Boris Cheshirkov said in a statement to AFP.In frontline Greek areas bearing the brunt of migration management, some locals claim that NGOs have a vested interest in seeing the migration crisis drag on. NGOs attacked on Lesbos In March, refugee support groups on Lesbos were targeted in the worst surge of violence since mass arrivals began in 2015.Angry mobs attacked cars with NGO markings after a new wave of migration encouraged by Turkey saw hundreds of asylum seekers arrive on Lesbos.“We can understand that the new government wants to establish a register for NGOs, if this is to gain greater control over who is actually working with these vulnerable people,” said Caroline Hervik, of Reaching, a small volunteer group of mainly Norwegian students working on the island of Chios.But because the registration process is “complex” and requires a Greek representative, Reaching’s work is currently on hold, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greece-culls-migrant-support-groups-in-transparency-overhaul/story-A8XkDJnnO1xlphD5upDSjM.html
20-06-2020||World||Greta Thunberg has hope for climate, despite leaders’ inaction||Preparing for her appearance before the U.N. General Assembly last fall, Greta Thunberg found herself constantly interrupted by world leaders, including U.N. chief Antonio Guterres and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who had formed a queue to speak to her and take selfies.“Jacinda Ardern, the prime minister of New Zealand, waits in line but doesn’t quite make it before it’s time for the event to start,” Thunberg recalls.Such surreal memories for a teenager form the opening to a 75-minute monologue broadcast on Swedish public radio Saturday that soon shifts to the serious matter of climate change that’s at the heart of Thunberg’s work.The 17-year-old has become a global figurehead of the youth climate movement since she started her one-woman protests outside the Swedish parliament in 2018.Thunberg’s blunt words to presidents and prime ministers, peppered with scientific facts about the need to urgently cut greenhouse gas emissions, have won her praise and awards, but also the occasionalpushback and even death threats.To Thunberg’s disappointment, her message doesn’t seem to be getting through even to those leaders who applaud her work.The message is certainly stark: Thunberg cites a U.N. report that estimates the world can only keep emitting the current amount of carbon dioxide for the next seven-and-a-half years. Any longer and it becomes impossible to meet the Paris climate accord’s ambitious goal of keeping global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) this century.Most governments refuse to accept the idea that the world has only a fixed “carbon budget” left, because it implies that a sudden shift away from fossil fuel will need to happen in just a few years.“Do you remember the London Olympics? ‘Gangnam Style’ or the first ‘Hunger Games’ movie?” Thunberg asks her audience on Swedish radio station P1. “Those things all happened about seven or eight years ago. That’s the amount of time we’re talking about.”Her months-long journey from Sweden to America’s West Coast and back — by train, sailboat and an electric car loaned by Arnold Schwarzenegger — highlighted the impact that global warming is already having, from melting glaciers to fiercer forest fire seasons, Thunberg said.It also opened her eyes to economic and social disparities affecting in particular Indigenous, Black and minority communities, voices she has sought to amplify in the climate debate.“The climate and sustainability crisis is not a fair crisis,” Thunberg says. “The ones who’ll be hit hardest from its consequences are often the ones who have done the least to cause the problem in the first place. ”Her frustration extends to journalists who want to know about “the real Greta” but interrupt her when she talks about the science of climate change.“People want something simple and concrete, and they want me to be naive, angry, childish, and emotional,” Thunberg says. “That is the story that sells and creates the most clicks.”Thunberg blasts governments and businesses that use what she calls “creative accounting” to makes their emissions look lower than they are and apply the word “green” to industries that are not.“The emperors are naked. Every single one,” she says. “It turns out our whole society is just one big nudist party.”Some critics have accused Thunberg of being a doom-monger. But she insists that her message is one of hope, not despair.“There are signs of change, of awakening,” she says. “Just take the ‘Me Too’ movement, ‘Black Lives Matter’ or the school strike movement (for climate action) for instance,” she says, adding that the world has passed a “social tipping point” where it becomes impossible to look away.The global response to the Covid-19 pandemic may provide a necessary wake-up call, she suggests.“The corona tragedy of course has no long term positive effects on the climate, apart from one thing only: namely the insight into how you should perceive and treat an emergency.

20-06-2020||World||China reports 34 new coronavirus cases; submits virus genome sequence to WHO||China has reported 34 new coronavirus cases, including 22 in Beijing, where the health officials have submitted the virus genome sequence from the recent clusters of Covid-19 infections to the World Health Organisation, officials said on Saturday.The National Health Commission (NHC) said 34 new cases, including seven asymptomatic infections of the Covid-19 were reported in the country.Twenty-two domestically transmitted cases were reported in Beijing and one in Hebei Province, the NHC said.It said 108 asymptomatic cases, including 57 from overseas, were still under medical observation.Beijing reported 22 newly confirmed domestically-transmitted Covid-19 cases and two asymptomatic cases on Friday, the municipal health commission said on Saturday.By the end of Friday, Beijing had reported 625 confirmed domestically-transmitted cases, including 411 who had been discharged from hospitals after recovery and nine deaths. There were 17 asymptomatic cases still under medical observation.The NHC said on Saturday that mainland China till now has reported 83,352 confirmed cases of coronavirus and 4,634 deaths.The officials alleged the new strain of the virus in Beijing came from Europe.So far, 174 imported cases have been reported in Beijing, with one still hospitalised.The Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has released the virus genome sequence from the recent clusters of Covid-19 infections related to Beijing’s Xinfadi wholesale farm produce market.The data, released through the Novel Coronavirus National Science and Technology Resource Service System on Thursday came from both Covid-19 case samples and environmental samples.The CDC has submitted the relevant genome sequence to the WHO and the global initiative on sharing all influenza data to share the data globally.Chinese virologists alleged the strain of the new virus in Beijing has European origin.An initial epidemiological survey shows the coronavirus strain detected at the Xinfadi wholesale market in Beijing came from Europe, a report in state-run Global Times said.It said the strain had existed longer than the current coronavirus strain circulating in Europe, Chinese virologists inferred.They say it is possible that the virus did not mutate during transport as it was sealed in frozen food, stored in cold and damp conditions, it said.Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, told the media on Thursday that the “findings at Beijing reminded us of the first outbreak of Covid-19 in Wuhan last year, which happened at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market”.The focus of the Huanan investigation was the wild animal stalls, even though the seafood sellers were right next to them, Wu said.The WHO has already questioned the Chinese officials’ claims that the virus was traced to the imported salmon in Xinfadi and purported origins to Europe saying that there is no evidence to back it.Ever since US President Donald Trump blamed China for not containing the Covid-19 when it first showed up in Wuhan in December last year, the debate over the origin of the virus has intensified.For its part, China sought to shift the blame saying that the virus may have been originated elsewhere and surfaced in Wuhan.President Trump and leaders of several countries have accused China of not being transparent in reporting the deadly disease, leading to huge human casualties and economic crisis across the world.A new study by Harvard researchers recently said satellite images show an increase in traffic outside five hospitals in the Chinese city from late August to December raising doubts that the virus may have surfaced in Wuhan by that time.The traffic spike coincided with a rise in online searches for information on symptoms like “cough” and “diarrhoea”.China said the study was “ridiculous” and based on “superficial” information, it said.Recently, the World Health Assembly (WHA), the decision-making body of the Geneva-based WHO, passed a unanimous resolution to probe the origin of the virus. China also backed the resolution.Most of the new cases have been linked to the Xinfadi wholesale food market.Until a week ago, the Chinese capital had been free of local transmission for 55 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-34-new-coronavirus-cases-submits-virus-genome-sequence-to-who/story-gyqq82SkLDkpSOW5YS6JGN.html

President Alejandro Giammattei pushed out Health Minister Hugo Monroy and named Amelia Flores, a former vice minister of health in an earlier administration, as his replacement.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMonroy, who had held the position since January, had been harshly criticized for his management of the pandemic. Federal lawmakers called him in multiple times for questioning and complained that the Health Ministry was spending too little of its budget during the pandemic. During his tenure, doctors from the public health system protested that they weren’t being paid. Images of hospitals overwhelmed by the sick have increasingly painted a grim picture of the situation in Guatemala. Guatemala has reported more than 11,000 confirmed Covid-19 cases and 449 deaths. President Alejandro Giammattei has been under growing pressure from the business sector to loosen restrictions. Earlier attempts to reactivate the economy were followed by a surge in infections, prompting Giammattei to clamp down again. Flores is a doctor who served in the administration of President Óscar Berger from 2004 to 2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/guatemala-replaces-health-minister-mid-pandemic/story-xkV4r0hEEYpDeymWkkHZoM.html
20-06-2020||World||UN sets up inquiry into racism after George Floyd death||The UN Human Rights Council on Friday condemned discriminatory and violent policing after the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last month and ordered a report on “systemic racism” against people of African descent.The 47-member-state forum unanimously adopted a resolution brought by African countries. The mandate also asks U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet to examine government responses to peaceful protests, including alleged use of excessive force, and deliver findings in a year’s time.Philonise Floyd, the brother of the Black man whose death under the knee of a white officer roused world protests against racial injustice, urged the forum on Wednesday to investigate U.S. police brutality and racial discrimination.Burkina Faso’s Ambassador Dieudonné W. Désiré Sougouri presented the African resolution on Friday, urging its adoption by consensus.“It is important to show Africa...the Human Rights Council has heard the plight of African and people of African descent calling for equal treatment and application of equal rights for all,” he said.The Africa group had made numerous “concessions” in the negotiations with other countries, he added.Senegal’s envoy Coly Seck, a former council president, welcomed the consensus, telling the talks: “Black Lives Matter”.The text was watered down during closed-door negotiations from an initial draft explicitly calling for a U.N. commission of inquiry on racism in the United States and elsewhere.“It is absurd that the final resolution passed by the United Nations strips mention of the United States, where police kill people, particularly Black people, at alarmingly higher rates compared to other developed countries,” said Jamil Dakwar of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), which led 600 activist groups in calling for the urgent debate.“The United Nations needs to do its job — not get bullied out of doing it — and hold the United States accountable,” he said in a statement.The Trump administration, which quit the forum two years ago alleging bias against its ally Israel, made no immediate comment. U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva Andrew Bremberg said on Wednesday that his country was “not above scrutiny” as it grappled with racial discrimination but was implementing police reforms after Floyd’s killing.During the debate, Western delegations including Australia, Germany, Italy, Poland and the European Union said that the United States should not be singled out.“This problem does not belong to any one country, it is a problem around the world,” said Australian ambassador Sally Mansfield.Activists said that Australia had been particularly active in negotiations to take the spotlight off the United States.Germany’s ambassador Michael Ungern-Sternberg said: “We are convinced a report with a broader approach and less focus on one specific case would have been more appropriate”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-sets-up-inquiry-into-racism-after-george-floyd-death/story-WdCiIGNgfYCxe4chaCtoEK.html

20-06-2020||World||US calls China ‘rogue state’, cites border attack||In a hard hitting speech, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Friday attacked China for its “rogue” attitude in its neighbourhood, specifically mentioning its recent border attacks against India. “The PLA (People’s Liberation Army) has escalated border tensions with India, the world’s most populous democracy. It’s militarising the South China Sea and illegally claiming more territory there, threatening vital sea lanes,” Pompeo said during an online conference on democracy in Copenhagen, Denmark. During questions he said democracies and freedom-loving peoples of the world needed to come together to tackle China. Pompeo was careful to focus his criticism on the Chinese Communist Party but unusually cited Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, by name. “General Secretary Xi Jinping has green-lighted a brutal campaign of repression against Chinese Muslims, a human rights violation on a scale we haven’t seen since World War II. Now, the PLA has escalated border tensions with India,” he said.Pompeo spoke a day after he expressed deep condolences to India on the death of 20 soldiers in violent clashes with Chinese troops at Galwan Valley in Ladakh on June 15. Pompeo said China was responsible for “pushing disinformation and malicious cyber campaigns so as to drive a wedge between the US and Europe.” The Chinese Communist Party wants to undo the progress the free world has made and adopt a new set of rules and norms that accommodate Beijing. He claimed Beijing had “lied about the coronavirus and let it spread to the rest of the world, while pressuring the WHO to assist its cover-up campaign. Hundreds of thousands of people have died, and the global economy has been decimated.” China continues to refuse to provide medical information or allow outside scientists. Pompeo, who recently met Chinese Politburo member Yang Jiechi in Hawaii, said much of his conversation was about “the fundamental idea that we’re just watching [their] actions. It’s no longer enough to listen to what the Chinese Communist Party is saying. We can see their actions.” He ticked off a number of them, “Hong Kong, Tibet, Xinjiang, what they’re doing in India, what they’ve done in the economic zones along the Philippines and Malaysia and Indonesia and Vietnam, the coercion on Australia.” The US minister warned that “China’s objective is in fact to single out and indeed to threaten to single out more directly” individual countries. He called for a collective response from the world’s major countries to what Beijing was doing. “America is engaging in a response to Chinese Communist Party and aggression in a way that America has not done for the past 20 years” and said this was now a bipartisan position.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-calls-china-rogue-state-cites-border-attack/story-3NkKvxgtpaS6j19D8mm07J.html
20-06-2020||World||White House preps for ‘Salute to America’ celebration on July 4 amid Covid-19 concerns||President Donald Trump is moving ahead with a lower-key “Salute to America” celebration this year on July Fourth, despite concerns from some lawmakers about the crowds the event could generate during the coronavirus pandemic.Washington has held an Independence Day celebration for decades, featuring a parade along Constitution Avenue, a concert on the Capitol lawn with music by the National Symphony Orchestra and fireworks beginning at dusk near the Washington Monument.Trump altered the lineup last year by adding his speech, moving the fireworks closer to the Lincoln Memorial and summoning an array of tanks and warplanes to entertain the crowds.The White House said that the president and first lady Melania Trump will host the event this year from the White House’s South Lawn and the Ellipse. It said the president will deliver remarks and that the ceremony will include music, military demonstrations and flyovers. Last year, Trump spoke near the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.“As President Trump has said, there will be an Independence Day celebration this year and it will have a different look than 2019 to ensure the health and safety of those attending,” said White House spokesman Judd Deere. “The American people have shown tremendous courage and spirit in the fight against this global pandemic just as our forefathers did in the fight to secure our independence, and both deserve celebration on America’s birthday this year.” Democratic lawmakers from the Washington region have stated their strong opposition to an event like last year’s.“Given the current COVID-19 crisis, we believe such an event would needlessly risk the health and safety of thousands of Americans. Further, this event would come at the cost of millions of taxpayer dollars while we are facing an unprecedented economic downturn due to the pandemic,” the lawmakers said in a May 26 letter to Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Interior Secretary David Bernhardt.One of the lawmakers who signed the letter, Rep. Don Beyer, D-Va., said after Friday’s announcement from the White House that the president should be capable of celebrating Independence Day responsibly.“Instead he is using the military to stage yet another costly political photo op,” Beyer asserted.The crowds on the National Mall are expected to be smaller, in part because one of the biggest draws of the day, the annual parade, has been cancelled. The parade is co-hosted by the National Park Service and a website for the event said local leadership projected that Covid-19 infection levels will not be abated to the degree that it would be safe or prudent to conduct the parade.The annual fireworks show will go on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-preps-for-salute-to-america-celebration-on-july-4-amid-covid-19-concerns/story-dWQMpVBUS2q8LSB1UlKeFL.html

20-06-2020||World||Germany, France, UK press Iran to provide atomic site access||The board of the United Nations’ atomic watchdog agency on Friday adopted a resolution calling for Iran to provide inspectors access to sites where the country is thought to have stored or used undeclared nuclear material, the Russian representative said. Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia’s ambassador to international organizations in Vienna, tweeted that his country and China had voted against the resolution that Germany, France and Britain proposed at a meeting of the International Atomic Energy Agency board. “We believe that the resolution can be counterproductive,” Ulyanov said, while also “stressing the need for Tehran and IAEA to settle this problem without delay.” Earlier this week, IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi reiterated concerns that for more than four months Iran had denied his inspectors access to two locations “ to clarify our questions related to possible undeclared nuclear material and nuclear-related activities.” Activities at the sites are thought to have been from the early 2000s, before Iran signed the 2015 nuclear deal with world powers. Iran maintains the International Atomic Energy Agency has no legal basis to inspect them. The agency has said that Iran continues to provide access to sites covered by the nuclear deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.Iran’s representative to the IAEA, Kazem Gharibabadi, said his country rejected the resolution. “We do not consider this resolution acceptable at all,” he said. “This resolution cannot create any legal obligation for the Islamic Republic of Iran in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency to grant the two accesses.” Since the United States withdrew unilaterally from the deal in 2018, the other signatories — Germany, France, Britain, Russia and China — have been struggling to save it. Meanwhile, Iran has been violating its restrictions, including the amount of uranium it can enrich and the purity of enrichment, to try to pressure those countries to provide additional economic relief to offset American sanctions. It is not clear what effect the new resolution will have on the JCPOA, but Iran threatened unspecified consequences. “The Islamic Republic of Iran will take appropriate action and respond to this resolution,” Gharibabadi said. Iran’s foreign ministry described the resolution as an “unconstructive, irresponsible and unacceptable action,” the state-run IRNA news agency reported. Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi accused Britain, France and Germany of creating tension between Iran and the IAEA and trying to avoid “their responsibilities based on the nuclear deal.” In a tweet, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif urged the three nations to “muster the courage to state publicly what they admit privately: their failure to fulfill even own JCPOA duties due to total impotence in resisting US bullying.” China’s ambassador to international organizations, Wang Qun, told board members he was “deeply concerned” about both Grossi’s decision to openly express concerns about being denied access and the resolution that was passed. He said, according to a copy of his statement provided to The Associated Press, that it could “set forth a process, under the current circumstances, that may bring the Iranian nuclear issue back to a crossroad full of uncertainties again.” The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Britain discussed Iran at a meeting in Berlin later Friday and issued a statement noting that the resolution passed with a “very strong majority.” The American representative, Jackie Wolcott, said the U.S. had supported the resolution and that the ball was now in Iran’s court. “The fact of the matter is this is entirely Iran’s decision,” she said in a conference call with reporters. “They could fix this overnight if they would just decide to comply with their obligations with the IAEA.” Germany, France and Britain in January invoked a dispute resolution mechanism designed to resolve issues with the 2015 deal or refer them to the U.N. Security Council. On Friday, their foreign ministers said that “we will seek a ministerial meeting to urge Iran to cooperate and to take stock of where we stand” in that process. If no resolution is found, the process could result in the resumption of U.N. and European Union sanctions on Iran. But the ministers warned against trying to force the reimposition of sanctions. “We firmly believe that any unilateral attempt to trigger U.N. sanctions snapback would have serious adverse consequences” in the U.N. Security Council, they said. “We would not support such a decision which would be incompatible with our current efforts to preserve the JCPOA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-france-uk-press-iran-to-provide-atomic-site-access/story-LzoFrJKqWSZ0eOa34BvH6I.html
20-06-2020||World||US attorney who oversaw cases of Donald Trump’s allies steps down||The US attorney who oversaw key prosecutions of allies of President Donald Trump and an investigation into Trump’s personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani is resigning from his post, officials said Friday.Geoffrey S. Berman is stepping down as the US attorney for the Southern District of New York, Attorney General William Barr said in a statement. The office is one of the nation’s premiere districts, trying major mob cases and terror cases over the years.It was unclear why Berman was leaving his position after serving more than two years. The announcement was made late Friday and came after Barr visited New York City to meet with local police officials.But his departure comes days after allegations surfaced from former Trump national security adviser John Bolton that Trump sought to interfere in an Southern District investigation into the Turkish Halkbank in an effort to cut deals with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.The shakeup was likely to raise additional questions from congressional Democrats who have accused Barr of politicizing the Justice Department and acting more like Trump’s personal attorney than the nation’s chief law enforcement officer.“Doesn’t sound like ‘stepping down,’” said Preet Bharara, the previous permanent US attorney there, said in a tweet Friday. “Why does a president get rid of his own hand-picked US Attorney in SDNY on a Friday night, less than 5 months before the election?”Trump intends to nominate Jay Clayton, the chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, to the post, Barr said. The US attorney in New Jersey, Craig Carpenito, will serve as the acting US attorney in Manhattan beginning on July 3, he said.The office has prosecuted a number of Trump associates, including Trump’s former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen, who served a prison sentence for lying to Congress and campaign finance crimes, and has also been investigating Giuliani and his associates. He had recused himself from directly overseeing the Cohen investigation for reasons that were never disclosed.Berman has also overseen the prosecution of two Florida businessmen, Lev Parnas and Igor Fruman, who were associates of Giuliani and tied to the Ukraine impeachment investigation. The men were charged in October with federal campaign finance violations, including hiding the origin of a $325,000 donation to a group supporting Trump’s reelection.Federal prosecutors in New York are investigating Giuliani’s business dealings, including whether he failed to register as a foreign agent, according to people familiar with the probe. The people were not authorized to discuss the investigation publicly and spoke on the condition of anonymity.Bolton’s tell-all, excerpts of which were posted by the news media this week, included details on how Trump sought to cut a deal to halt SDNY’s investigation into whether Halkbank violated US sanctions against Iran in order to free an American pastor imprisoned in Turkey. Six weeks after the pastor’s release, Bolton writes that on a call with Erdoğan, “Trump then told Erdoğan he would take care of things, explaining that the Southern District prosecutors were not his people, but were Obama people, a problem that would be fixed when they were replaced by his people.” The episode occurred months after Berman assumed the role of US attorney.A Republican who contributed to the president’s election campaign, Berman worked for the same law firm as Giuliani and was put in his job by the Trump administration. But as US attorney, he won over some skeptics after he went after Trump allies.Berman was appointed by then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions in January 2018, months after Bharara was fired after refusing to resign along with dozens of other federal prosecutors appointed by President Barack Obama.Three months later, FBI agents raided Cohen’s offices, an act the president decried as a politically motivated witch hunt.Berman has taken a direct hand in other investigations that have angered Trump.His office subpoenaed Trump’s inaugural committee for a wide range of documents as part of an investigation into various potential crimes, including possible illegal contributions from foreigners to inaugural events.And weeks before the 2018 midterm election, Berman announced insider trading charges against an ardent Trump supporter, Republican Rep. Chris Collins. Collins, who represented western New York, has since resigned.Under Berman’s tenure, his office also brought charges against Michael Avenatti, the combative lawyer who gained fame by representing porn actress Stormy Daniels in lawsuits involving Trump. Avenatti was convicted in February of trying to extort Nike after prosecutors said he threatened to use his media access to hurt Nike’s reputation and stock price unless the sportswear giant paid him up to $25 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-attorney-who-oversaw-cases-of-donald-trump-s-allies-steps-down/story-rRNKePzkxCTc3BfVIKDKII.html
20-06-2020||World||Brazil tops 1 mn Covid-19 cases, specialists say actual number may be 7 times higher||Brazil’s government confirmed on Friday that the country has risen above 1 million confirmed coronavirus cases, second only to the United States.The country’s health ministry said that the total now stood at 1,032,913, up more than 50,000 from Thursday. The ministry said the sharp increase was due to corrections of previous days’ underreported numbers.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro still downplays the risks of the virus after nearly 50,000 deaths from Covid-19 in three months, saying the impact of social isolation measures on the economy could be worse than the disease itself.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage Specialists believe the actual number of cases in Brazil could be up to seven times higher than the official statistic. Johns Hopkins University says Brazil is performing an average of 14 tests per 100,000 people each day, and health experts say that number is up to 20 times less than needed to track the virus.Official data show a downward trend of the virus in Brazil’s north, including the hard-hit region of the Amazon, a plateau in cases and deaths in the countries’ biggest cities near the Atlantic coast, but a rising curve in the south.In the Brazilian countryside, which is much less prepared to handle a crisis, the pandemic is clearly growing. Many smaller cities have weaker health care systems and basic sanitation that’s insufficient to prevent contagion.Click here for complete coronavirus coverage “There is a lot of regional inequality in our public health system and a shortage of professionals in the interior,” said Miguel Lago, executive director of Brazil’s Institute for Health Policy Studies, which advises public health officials. “That creates many health care deserts, with people going long distances to get attention. When they leave the hospital, the virus can go with them.” The cattle-producing state of Mato Grosso was barely touched by the virus when it hit the nation’s biggest cities in March. Sitting far from the coast, between the Bolivian border and Brazil’s capital of Brasilia, its 3.3 million residents led a mostly normal life until May. But now its people live under lockdown and meat producers have dozens of infected workers.In Tangará da Serra, a city of 103,000 people in Mato Grosso, the mayor decided Friday to forbid the sale of alcoholic drinks for two weeks as an incentive for people to stay home. Fábio Junqueira said the measure was needed after a spike in Covid-19 cases that filled 80% of the city’s 54 intensive care beds. The city has had nearly 300 cases of the disease, plus three fatalities.In Rondonópolis, only 300 miles away from Tangará da Serra and home to a thriving economy, health authorities closed the local meatpacking industry after 92 cases were confirmed there. The city of 144,000 inhabitants counted 21 deaths from the virus and more than 600 cases. The mayor has also decided to limit sales of alcoholic beverages.Even regions once considered examples of successful efforts against the virus are now struggling.Porto Alegre, home to about 1.4 million people, had success in slowing the virus’ spread over the last three months. But now its mayor is considering increasing social isolation measures after ICU occupancy in the city jumped to 80% this month.“We were already making projections for schools to come back,” Mayor Nelson Marchezan Jr. told The Associated Press. “Now the trend is to impose more restrictions.” Outside Sao Paulo city, five regions of the state’s countryside will have to close shops starting Monday due to a rise in coronavirus cases. Gov. João Doria announced the decision Friday.Dr. Mike Ryan, the World Health Organization’s executive director, said at a news conference that Brazil needs to increase its efforts to stop the spread of infections.“The epidemic is still quite severe in Brazil. I believe health workers are working extremely hard and under pressure to be able to deal with the number of cases that they see on a daily basis,” Ryan said. “Certainly the rise is not as exponential as it was previously, so there are some signs that the situation is stabilizing. But we’ve seen this before in other epidemics in other countries.” Margareth Dalcolmo, a clinical researcher and professor of respiratory medicine at the state-funded Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Rio de Janeiro, believes the reopening in major cities and the virus traveling by road into Brazil’s heartland will keep the pressure on the country’s health system.“The risk in the interior now is very big,” she said. ”Our health system just can’t solve the most serious cases of COVID in many places of the countryside.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-tops-1-mn-covid-19-cases-specialists-say-actual-number-may-be-7-times-higher/story-B4OHHQMRWbrVzUFpKKYDVI.html

Restaurants are offering more take-out and outdoor seating. Major retailer Uniqlo’s new “cool and dry” mask, three for 990 yen ($9), sold out Friday shortly after it was put on the shelves.Japan’s economy is opening cautiously, with social-distancing restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic.The delicate “new normal” balancing act playing out around the world is precarious but imperative for Japan, whose long stagnant economy sorely needs tourism, exports and thriving small businesses to avoid sliding deeper into recession.Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities, said although Japan’s coronavirus restrictions were never as strict as the lockdowns in the US, Europe and some other parts of Asia, the damage was still considerable.Japan’s economy was already hurting from a tax increase last year. Then auto exports to the US and Europe plunged when the coronavirus hit. Consumer spending is unlikely to recover quickly.“Americans may feel happy and go splurging after the lockdown is lifted. But the Japanese mind set tends to become even more cautious about spending because of uncertainties about the future,” Maruyama said.A return to pre-pandemic levels of economic activity is not expected for Japan until 2023, a year after a likely recovery in the US, he said.Although shuttered businesses are opening again, fewer seats are allowed at theaters, events and hostess and host bars. Masked clerks peer from behind plastic curtains at stores where temperatures are checked and hands disinfected at the entrance. Professional baseball is playing to empty stands.Masks, worn by many Japanese already anyway due to a near national allergy to cedar pollen, are the dress code everywhere.Japan’s exports and imports have plunged. The world’s third largest economy has contracted for two straight quarters and is already officially in recession.The Tokyo Olympics, the big symbol of hope for the economy, has been postponed until next year, costing billions of dollars to the capital, although the exact amount has not been disclosed.The government has announced 230 trillion yen ($2 trillion) in stimulus, including help for local businesses and cash handouts of 100,000 yen ($930) per adult to coax consumers into spending.With about 1,000 coronavirus-related deaths, Japan has been spared the massive fatalities that have swept Italy, Spain, the US, Brazil and Russia. But critics fear the government’s push to relax precautions is about choosing the economy over health concerns.That includes reviving moribund tourism. The government is considering reopening travel to and from countries where coronavirus cases are relatively limited and comparable to Japan’s, such as Australia, New Zealand, Vietnam and Thailand.The 1,700 visitors to Japan in May was a decrease of 99.9% from the year before, according to the Japan National Tourism Organization, and the lowest figure since the government began keeping track in 1964.In recent years Japan has attracted about 30 million visitors from abroad, mostly from South Korea and China.Travel within Japan was temporarily curtailed under a government “emergency” to curb the spread of the virus but is now encouraged.

20-06-2020||World||Police accountability bills stall in Minnesota Legislature||A special session of the Minnesota Legislature appeared to be in a stalemate Friday with both parties deeply divided on how far lawmakers should go toward remaking policing in the state where George Floyd was killed.The Democratic-controlled House early Friday passed an extensive package of police accountability measures wrapped into one bill. It includes elements of five more modest policing bills that the Republican-controlled Senate passed earlier in the week but would make bigger changes than what Senate Republicans have said they’ll accept.As lawmakers huddled behind closed doors, or met on the floors to pass less-contentious legislation, around 400 demonstrators held a Juneteenth rally outside the Capitol, where they chanted Floyd’s name and called for lawmakers to pass the House bill.GOP Senate Majority Leader Paul Gazelka, of East Gull Lake, repeatedly has said that Friday was his deadline for adjournment, and that lawmakers should focus on proposals both parties can support. But Democratic leaders from both chambers urged him at a news conference to allow more time so that both sides could seek compromises on policing and other thorny issues. He postponed indefinitely his own news conference set for Friday afternoon.“We have to do something on police accountability and reform,” Democratic House Speaker Melissa Hortman, of Brooklyn Park, told reporters. “The tragic murder of George Floyd on May 25th changed the entire legislative agenda. There is no way for us to look away from this injustice, and to not do the work that thousands of Minnesotans and millions of people around the world are demanding that governments take up.” Democratic Gov, Tim Walz on Thursday challenged lawmakers to put the House bill on his desk in time to sign on Juneteenth, a holiday that has long commemorated the emancipation of enslaved Blacks but turned this year into one of protest against police brutality and racism following the killing of Floyd, an African American who died after a white Minneapolis police officer pressed a knee into his neck for several minutes.“Today as people across the state and nation recognize and observe Juneteenth, Senate Republicans are sending a loud message by choosing to pack up and leave before we’ve finished the work that Minnesotans are expecting us to do,” Democratic Senate Minority Leader Susan Kent, of Woodbury, told reporters.”Black, Indigenous and people of color have spent years fighting for justice. We can spend a little more than a week doing the same.” Walz, who has called for making Juneteenth a state holiday, spoke Friday with musician Pharrell Williams, who tweeted that he’s asking every governor to make it a paid holiday for state employees, and that he spoke with a number of governors Friday. “Thank you for fighting for this issue. #Juneteenth is an important part of our history, and it should be recognized and remembered by our entire state each year,” Walz wrote as he retweeted Williams’ thanks.The two parties also remained divided on the main unfinished business of the 2020 regular session, a public construction borrowing package known as a bonding bill, which could potentially include money for rebuilding neighborhoods in Minneapolis and St. Paul where businesses were damaged and destroyed in the unrest that followed Floyd’s killing.Other unresolved issues included a potential tax break that could benefit businesses seeking to rebuild, and how to allocate federal coronavirus relief money to local governments from the $2.1 billion the state received under the CARES Act.If there is no agreement on the big issues, lawmakers are likely to get another chance in mid-July.Assuming Walz intends to issue another 30-day extension of the emergency powers he’s been using to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic, he’s legally required to call another special session for July 12 to let lawmakers object. That’s why he called this special session. House Democrats blocked a Senate GOP attempt last week to remove the governor’s emergency authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-accountability-bills-stall-in-minnesota-legislature/story-jfmmikbtoWgxEgptbjIEdM.html
20-06-2020||World||Mail-in voting presents ‘biggest risk’ to reelection, says Trump||President Donald Trump on Friday said the growing use of mail-in ballots is the “biggest risk” to his reelection, and his chances may hinge on whether he can successfully block efforts to make voting by mail easier during the pandemic. Trump’s comments were his first casting such high stakes for his multimillion-dollar legal campaign to fight mail-in voting. It comes as several battleground states are engaged in heated fights over plans for November’s general election, and courts are settling partisan disputes over how easy it should be to vote by mail. “My biggest risk is that we don’t win lawsuits,” Trump said in an interview with Politico published Friday. “We have many lawsuits going all over. And if we don’t win those lawsuits, I think — I think it puts the election at risk.” Health officials have said voting by mail can help prevent the spread of the coronavirus. But Trump has made clear he believes widespread mail-in voting would benefit Democrats. He has alleged — without citing evidence — that mail voting will lead to massive fraud, and the Republican National Committee has budgeted $20 million to fight Democratic lawsuits in at least 18 states aimed at expand it. To some degree, Trump’s effort appears to be pushing against the tide. Many states, including some with GOP leaders, are moving ahead with plans that ease access to mail-in ballots. Wisconsin, a state that swung to Trump in 2016, decided this week to send absentee ballot requests to nearly all voters before November’s elections, a step already taken by Michigan, another swing state. Primary elections have seen a surge in mail-in voting that suggests voters are comfortable casting ballots remotely. Many states already have easy access — requiring no excuses. “The president and his supporters are actively fighting against vote by mail when that is somewhat of a moot point,” said Wendy Weiser of the Brennan Center for Justice. “In most of the country, voters are allowed to vote by mail and many chose to do so.” “The question isn’t whether they should be moving to vote by mail — it is happening. The question is, Are we going to be ready for that change? It is coming. It is happening.” Still, state legislatures and courts have plenty of details to fight about. The Democratic lawsuits typically seek a list of changes to state voting rules — such as allowing ballots to be collected by community groups, a practice often derided as ballot harvesting. They’re also seeking to ensure ballots postmarked as late as Election Day are counted. Arizona on Friday settled a Democratic lawsuit by agreeing to make it easier for minorities and rural residents to cast ballots remotely. The state agreed to expand the number of ballot drop boxes in rural, Latino and tribal areas and engage in an education campaign in Spanish and tribal languages about the absentee process. There are also four federal lawsuits pending in Wisconsin, a state that Trump won by fewer than 73,000 votes in 2016. The state’s bipartisan elections commission voted this week to send absentee ballot requests to 80% of voters ahead of November, after a chaotic April election. In Michigan, the state’s Democratic secretary of state has already sent absentee ballot requests to all voters before November. Trump slammed Michigan’s move, and his party has taken notice. In Iowa, the Republican-controlled legislature passed a bill to prevent that state’s secretary of state, also a Republican, from sending all voters an absentee request — as he did for this month’s primary — without approval of a legislative committee. The legislature also passed a bill making it harder for county elections officials to correct minor errors on mail ballots. It’s unclear whether the state’s Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, will sign the bills. In California, in response to GOP litigation challenging Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom’s decision to send every voter a mail ballot, the Democratic-controlled state legislature is formally approving that program. “Expanding vote-by-mail statewide is a necessity to protect our right to vote and our public health,” California Secretary of State Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said. In states with divided government, the action has been less dramatic. In North Carolina, a compromise bill passed the GOP-controlled legislature last week that would reduce from two to one the number of witnesses required to sign a voter’s request for a mail ballot. The legislation, signed by Democratic Gov. Rory Cooper, also allows voters to request absentee ballots online or via fax. Georgia’s Republican secretary of state’s office is also developing an online system where voters can request absentee ballots as it opts not to send out absentee ballot applications ahead of the November election after doing so for the state’s primary, prompting criticism from Democrats. State election officials said the high cost of sending applications during the primary to 6.9 million registered voters plus the massive workload it triggered for local election offices caused them to rethink their plan for November. “We are not scaling back our efforts,” said Gabe Sterling, a top official in the Georgia secretary of state’s office. “We are refining our efforts so it can actually be successful with the resources we have available to us.” Democrats in Congress are pushing to send $3.6 billion to states to help them revamp voting systems. Republicans have yet to act on the measure, contained in a Democratic bill that includes sweeping mandates on voting procedures that are considered a nonstarter in the GOP-controlled Senate. In Florida, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order that stopped short of the demands of county election officials, who had sought a longer early voting period and flexibility in consolidating polling places to address a poll worker shortage. Instead, DeSantis’ order would close schools on Election Day so they can serve as polling locations, state employees would receive administrative leave to staff precincts and more time would be allowed to count absentee ballots amid the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mail-in-voting-presents-biggest-risk-to-reelection-says-trump/story-lm3Bs6VarY0rj3gIkupgSO.html
20-06-2020||World||UK city council rules out removing Gandhi statue||The Leicester City Council on Friday ruled out the possibility of Mahatma Gandhi’s statue being removed from an arterial road in the city, days after an online petition seeking its removal with over 6,000 signatures was submitted to the council. Peter Soulsby, mayor of Leicester, gave the assurance that the statue installed on Belgrave Road in 2009 will not be removed in a letter to former Labour MP from Leicester East, Keith Vaz. The city in the east Midlands has a large population of Indian origin.Soulsby, a Labour party politician, wrote: “I well remember the pride and pleasure we enjoyed when this very prominent statue was unveiled on Belgrave Road”.“It was a matter of great pride that our City with the generous support of the donors was able to celebrate the life of Bapu who was so inspirational in the creation of modern India and such as example to the rest of the world”.“I am delighted to be able to give you an absolute assurance that there is no prospect whatsoever of the council agreeing at any time to the removal of the statue – and certainly not while I remain Mayor”, Soulsby added.The council had previously noted that it was aware of the petition and would consider it as part of wider review of statues, street names and building names in the city. The review was sparked all over the UK by the Black Lives Matter campaign against symbols of racism and slavery.According to a council spokesperson, “In such a culturally-diverse city as Leicester, it’s important that we respect the histories of all our communities and understand the context for the historical references that are part of our streetscape and built environment.”The Gandhi statue in Leicester installed with donations from charity organisation Samanwaya Pariwar is among seven across the UK: Tavistock Square, London (1968), Parliament Square, London (2015); Saughton Park, Edinburgh (1997); Museum Quarter, Hull (2004); Belgrave Road, Leicester (2009); Cardiff Bay, Cardiff (2017), and Manchester (2019).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-city-council-rules-out-removing-gandhi-statue/story-GNkvlq1FnjgiXf3EUfzdRJ.html
20-06-2020||World||Outbreak speeding up with 150k cases in a day: WHO||The coronavirus pandemic is accelerating, with Thursday’s 150,000 new cases the highest in a single day and nearly half of those in the Americas, the World Health Organization (WHO) said.“The world is in a new and dangerous phase,” Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a virtual briefing from WHO headquarters in Geneva. “The virus is still spreading fast, it is still deadly, and most people are still susceptible.”More than 8.53 million people have been reported infected by the novel coronavirus globally and 453,834​ have died, a Reuters tally showed as of 1326 GMT on Friday.Tedros, whose leadership of the WHO has been severely criticised by U.S. President Donald Trump, urged people to maintain social distancing and “extreme vigilance.” As well as the Americas, a large number of new cases were coming from South Asia and the Middle East, Tedros added. WHO emergencies expert Mike Ryan drew attention to the situation in Brazil, where he said there had been 1,230 additional COVID-19 deaths in the previous 24 hours. About 12 percent of infections in Brazil involved healthcare workers, he added, praising their bravery. Brazil has the world’s worst outbreak outside the United States, with 978,142 confirmed cases and 47,748 deaths.“DIFFICULT JOURNEY” TO VACCINEWith many nations easing restrictions but fearful of a second wave of infections, Ryan urged a gradual and scientific approach. “Exiting lockdowns must be done carefully, in a step-wise manner, and must be driven by the data,” he said. “If don’t know where it is the chances are the virus will surprise you.”Ryan said the resurgence of new clusters did not necessarily mean a second wave, while “second peaks” were also possible in one wave. The emergencies expert praised Germany, China and South Korea for their handling of the pandemic.With trials underway around the world to find medicines and a vaccine for COVID-19, WHO officials warned that large-scale testing would be needed with side-effects carefully monitored.“Although it is not impossible to find a vaccine ... it’s going to be a very difficult journey,” Tedros said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-warns-coronavirus-pandemic-accelerating/story-qplRJfTHod7uKvZ5RjmezN.html
20-06-2020||India||Day after RS polls, BJP MLA, wife test Covid +ve in MP||Bhopal A Bharatiya Janata Party legislator and his wife tested positive for Covid-19 on Saturday a day after he cast his vote during the Rajya Sabha polls held at the assembly premises on Friday, according to legislators from Congress and BJP. The MLA had also attended the BJP legislature party meetings on Wednesday and Thursday.The MLA happens to be the second legislator in the state to be infected with Covid-19. Earlier, a Congress MLA tested positive for the virus. He turned up in a personal protective equipment (PPE) kit in the state assembly on Friday afternoon to cast his vote. He, however, had been given the facility of a postal ballot that he didn’t go for, according to legislators.The state Congress has accused the BJP MLA of putting in peril the life of other legislators including chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan who chaired the BJP legislature party meetings and also cast his vote in RS polls, state assembly secretariat staff and the selected media people who were allowed to cover the Rajya Sabha polls amid the Covid-19 situation.State Congress spokesperson Ajay Yadav said, “We have learnt that the BJP MLA got samples of his wife and himself tested for coronavirus two days back but still he attended the BJP legislature party meetings. He has committed a grave offence by concealing the information about his health and he should be immediately booked.”The MLA confirmed that he and his wife had tested positive for Covid-19. However, he said, they went for the test on Friday only. “When my wife complained about fever we got our samples tested on Friday. Now we are going to be hospitalised,” the MLA said over phone.State BJP spokesperson and MLA Rameshwar Sharma said, “I can’t comment on whether the MLA knew about his health conditions but we are alert about our health and consulting doctors as to what to do. However, certain MLAs have gone to hospitals too for their test today. Another concern is many MLAs who came from other districts to Bhopal to cast their votes have returned to their homes. If any of these MLAs test positive for coronavirus, his family members too will be prone to contracting the disease and so will the others who are in contact with him.”State assembly principal secretary and returning officer for Rajya Sabha election AP Singh said, “We all followed all required safety measures including social distancing norms and the state assembly premises was sanitised on Friday. But it’s a matter of concern if the MLA removed his face mask to talk to others or some legislators and others might have come close to him.”As many as 206 MLAs cast their votes on Friday during the Rajya Sabha polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-rs-polls-bjp-mla-wife-test-covid-ve-in-mp/story-YQ7IhvXB9gOZ3VvFa3PUwI.html

20-06-2020||India||Puri King asks Naveen Patnaik to move SC to modify order stopping Rath Yatra||Two days after the Supreme Court stayed the Rath Yatra in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Gajapati Dibyasingh Deb, the titular king of Puri, requested chief minister Naveen Patnaik to approach top court for modification of the order to permit the Rath Yatra only at Puri.On Thursday, a three-judge bench, headed by chief justice SA Bobde had stayed the Rath Yatra scheduled for June 23, saying as 10-12 lakh people may congregate in Puri for the Rath Yatra, it would be appropriate in the interests of public health and safety of citizens to restrain the government from holding the Rath Yatra. Later in the evening, the state cabinet headed by the CM decided to abide by the SC order.The SC judgement caused a massive outrage in Odisha with at least four intervention petitions including one by Chhatisa Nijoga, the apex body of priests of the Jagannath temple filing two intervention petitions in the matter seeking recall of the order and allowing Rath Yatra at Puri by adhering to the government’s guidelines on Covid-19. On Saturday, several priests staged protests in front of the Jagannath temple in Puri demanding that the festival be held as scheduled. The Puri king, who heads the management of the 12th century Jagannath temple, is considered the first servitor of the deities, had initially said he concurred with the state cabinet decision on not holding Rath Yatra. But after attending meeting of Chhatisa Nijog, he said that festival has not been stopped even in the midst of the worst natural disasters and epidemics“The present crisis caused by Covid pandemic, is not a situation which renders it impossible to conduct Ratha Yatra in Puri as it can be held without any congregation of the general public. If Ratha Yatra is not held this year in Puri, it will hurt the religious sentiments of countless devotees around the world who watch the sacred Yatra live every year on electronic media. I request you to take appropriate steps for approaching the Supreme Court for a partial modification of its June 18 so as to permit performance of Ratha Yatra only at Puri,” wrote Divyasingh Deb in his letter to Patnaik.The Puri king said that Lord Jagannatha is the Lord of the Universe and during this sacred festival he comes out of the temple and rides the chariot so that everyone can obtain his grace. “It is an established tradition of Sanatana Vaidika Dharma that the presiding deities do not at all leave their sanctum sanctorum. But Lord Jagannath himself created an exception to this general rule by coming out of the temple to bless all beings in the whole universe. This is one of the main objectives of the Ratha Yatra as mentioned in the sacred scriptures.” He further said that managing committee of the temple is statutorily bound to ensure conduct of Ratha Yatra in accordance with the Record-of-Rights and Ratha Yatra in Puri should not be stopped, even if Ratha Yatra and other religious functions are not permitted elsewhere under Covid-19 restrictions. Citing a 1964 order of SC he said the Rath Yatra of Puri is unique which “requires special treatment” by the state government.Meanwhile, Chhastisa Nijog, the apex body of the priests of the temple has moved two intervention petitions seeking recall of the June 18 order of the SC. Janardhan Pattajoshi Mohapatra, chief servitor of Lord Jagannath in his petition said that the Rath Yatra has an unbroken tradition and is an essential practice of the Jagannath temple.Three more intervention applications have been filed to allow the conduct of the Rath Yatra. While Jagannath Sanskruti Jana Jagarana Mancha sought a recall of the Supreme Court order another intervention application seeking a partial modification of the SC order was filed by one Aftab Hossen, which argued that crores of rupees have been spent in construction of the chariots and Covid-19 tests of hundreds of servitors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puri-king-asks-naveen-patnaik-to-move-sc-to-modify-order-stopping-rath-yatra/story-2JwaYKmSHuyd68sQS5fCHP.html
20-06-2020||India||‘No restrictions on using firearms’: India gives soldiers freedom along LAC in extraordinary times||A significant change in Rules of Engagement (ROE) by the Indian Army following the Galwan Valley skirmish that left 20 Indian soldiers dead gives “complete freedom of action” to commanders deployed along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC) to “handle situations at the tactical level,” two senior officers said on Saturday on condition of anonymity.The commanders will no longer be bound by restrictions on the use of firearms and will have full authority to respond to “extraordinary situations” using all resources at their disposal, said one of the officers cited above.The amendment in ROE comes after Indian and Chinese soldiers engaged in their first deadly conflict in 45 years in Galwan Valley on June 15, resulting in death of 20 Indian army troops and several Chinese casualties.Also read: Released after 60 hours by China, 10 Indian soldiers undergo debriefingIn his remarks during an all-party meeting on Friday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the army had been given the freedom to take necessary steps along the border and India had conveyed its position (to China) through diplomatic means.“With the changes in the ROE, there’s nothing that limits the ability of Indian commanders to take whatever action they deem necessary on the LAC. ROE have been amended to address the brutal tactics being employed by Chinese troops,” said the second officer cited above.The seven-hour Galwan Valley clash marked the first time India suffered combat fatalities in an incident involving Chinese troops since 1975. Changes in ROE were imminent after a series of violent clashes along the border, with the army finally deciding not to restrict the scope of response of its soldiers after the June 15 clash, the second officer said.“Two violent clashes took place in Pangong Tso (May 5-6) and Galwan Valley (around mid-May) before the June 15 skirmish in eastern Ladakh. On all occasions, they came in huge numbers and assaulted our troops with iron roads and nail-studded clubs. Our troops fought back fearlessly but the ROE had to be revisited,” he said.Also read: India tells China to stick to its side, says no soldier missingForward troops keep their guns slung on their backs with the magazines in pouches and not clipped on.“Since soldiers are allowed to carry weapons while patrolling the LAC, it is inherent that they can use the firearms in unprecedented situations like the attack in Galwan Valley,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).The government said on Thursday that soldiers involved in the June 15 clash with Chinese troops were carrying weapons and ammunition but did not open fire as they were following border agreements between the two countries -- a remark that came in response to a question from Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on whether the Indian soldiers were sent in “unarmed”.“Let us get the facts straight. All troops on border duty always carry arms, especially when leaving post. Those at Galwan on 15 June did so. Long-standing practice (as per 1996 & 2005 agreements) not to use firearms during faceoffs,” external affairs minister S Jaishankar tweeted, responding to a post by Gandhi earlier this week.Border agreements from 1996 and 2005 between India and China disallow the use of firearms during face-offs. Article 6 of the agreement on confidence-building measures in the military field along the LAC, signed by India and China in November 1996, states that both sides will not open fire or “conduct blast operations or hunt with guns or explosives within two kilometers from the Line of Actual Control”.Top retired commanders and China watchers, however, said that Galwan clash and last month’s Pangong Tso brawl were not classical face-offs between rival troops but were extremely violent attacks on Indian soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-restrictions-on-firearms-india-gives-soldiers-freedom-along-lac-in-extraordinary-times/story-pCcFAcSAkMRschq50Tom1L.html
20-06-2020||India||In 3rd phase of Vande Bharat Mission, two flights to bring stranded Indians from China||India has arranged two flights to bring back Indians stranded in China because of the Covid-19 pandemic in the third phase of Vande Bharat Mission, against the backdrop of heightened tensions between the two sides over a border standoff.There will be close to 600 flights in the third phase of Vande Bharat Mission, the country’s largest operation to repatriate its nationals from around the world. Several hundred Indians were evacuated from China, including Wuhan, in special flights shortly after the Covid-19 outbreak, though China wasn’t included in the first two phases of the repatriation programme.The first flight to China under the third phase was scheduled for 10 pm on June 20 from Shanghai to Delhi and the second for 10.40 am on June 29 from Guangzhou to Delhi. The flights are expected to repatriate a total of almost 490 Indian nationals, according to a schedule on the external affair ministry’s website.Tensions between and India and China spiked after a violent face-off between border troops of the two sides at Galwan Valley along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) on June 15 left 20 Indian soldiers dead.

20-06-2020||India||Govt to form rules for movement of vehicles between India and its neighbours||The Centre on Saturday proposed to issue guidelines for facilitating movement of passengers and good vehicles with neighbouring countries and amend existing motor vehicle rules.A draft notification of the new guidelines was issued Saturday by the ministry of road transport and highways inviting suggestions from all, including the general public. Hindustan Times has reviewed a copy of the draft.The proposed rules will be called the Central Motor Vehicles (Regulation of Bus Service between India and Neighbouring countries of India (Movement of Vehicles Carrying Goods and Passengers) Rules, 2020.According to the draft rules, the transport department, government of any states of India (as mentioned in MoU) will be responsible for the conduct of the bus service and will perform various other duties assigned to them.It will be the duty of state police to provide security to the bus service. A DIG rank police office shall be assigned such responsibilities. The Intelligence Bureau (IB) will be the nodal intelligence agency coordinating the intelligence related issues for smooth conduct of bus service.The bus service will be running for as many days (as mentioned in MoU) and frequency will be reviewed by the state transport department. “The bus service shall follow the designated routes as mentioned in MoU and the state transport department will decide the halting place for the buses. The state transport department will take care of formalities like provisioning of tickets, debugging of bus, roadworthiness of the bus, frisking/checking of passengers, handling of luggage, etc, before departure from the designated place. The various agencies shall perform responsibilities assigned to them at ICP (integrated check post) of India,” the draft rules state.The proposed rules also say that the drivers shall carry a regular permit for transport vehicle valid for one year and renewable upto a maximum period of five years on a yearly basis. In addition to the registration number assigned to a transport vehicle operating under the agreement by the competent authority, the following particulars shall be painted in English and in official language of the respective country [each letter being not less than two inches (five centimeters) high and two inches (five centimeters) wide, legibly painted on a plain plate or plates affixed to the vehicles], including i) Place of India - Place of India Neighbouring Country - Place of India (on front side and back side of such transport vehicle in a conspicuous place) and the name of the operator of the bus service (on both the sides of such transport vehicle).This ministry said it had been receiving requests from various government departments and states regarding supporting rules required under the provisions of Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, for the facilitation of movement of vehicles carrying goods and passengers between Indian states and other neighbouring countries from time to time.To be clear, India presently does not have central guidelines for facilitating movement with neighbouring countries. According to a ministry official, these will be the first standard guidelines to streamline movement with neighbouring countries.The ministry has at present notified rules for the facilitation of bus service between Amritsar and Lahore (2006), between New Delhi and Lahore (2000), between Calcutta and Dhaka (2000) and Amritsar and Nankana Sahib (2006).All such regulations have been finalised to facilitate operations under MOUs which have been signed between India and other neighbouring countries. In 2018, India also notified rules regarding movement of Bangladesh registered LPG trucks in Indian territory for supply of bulk LPG to the LPG Bottling Plant at Bishalgarh in Tripura.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-to-form-rules-for-movement-of-vehicles-between-india-and-its-neighbours/story-hki80CGPDKfyrRAaU7jggN.html

Once, we were together but that was in Mumbai so we had a small celebration as I had a meeting there but this time it’s going to be very special as we are together and spending quality time at our home,” said the singer.Talking about his bonding with his father Devendra Prasad Mishra and mother Geeta, he says, “When I left Lucknow, I was mamma’s boy and now after this lockdown I’m papa’s boy…so it’s pretty balanced now.”After Mother’s Day celebrations last month, he now has plans for this occasion as well. “There are some surprises which of course are gifts. I will help my mother cook some Indian cuisine which he likes. I will try to take the family to this ancient Bhuddhesharan Temple if it’s open. In evening, the family will connect on video call with sister (Sushma), my Tayaji and Chachaji as we are a big family unit.”Talking about his father’s music inclination, Amit shares, “He rarely sings but is very fond of music. He is fun loving and we tease him a lot as his favorite performer till date is yesteryear’s actor Helen. ‘Bahut moody hai woh.’ On the same time, he is very rooted and disciplined. My mother is fan of Kishor (Kumar) and Mohd Rafi while father is enjoys songs of Mukesh and Mahendra Kapoor. We had large collection of cassettes which probably gave a base to my musical interest.”Amit now plans to make Lucknow his base, “Mumbai has been my ‘karambhoomi’ and will remain so. But during this lockdown and staying with my parents I have realised what I was missing. Now, I will be frequently traveling to Mumbai but will be based in Lucknow and will try to spend at least 7-8 days with family every month. ‘Mujhen yeah rishte kismet se wapas mile hai isey main khona nahi chahta’ (I have got it back all relations by luck and I don’t want to lose it further). Now, I understand how much they missed me and I missed them…that way this has been the best realisation during this lockdown!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/celebrating-father-s-day-in-lucknow-after-a-decade/story-XjI4blyWu72xO40ZuCkbOK.html
20-06-2020||India||Goa will now discharge asymptomatic patients without negative test||The Goa government will follow the discharge protocol as recommended by the Union Health Ministry and cease its practice of compulsorily testing each Covid-19 patient twice before release, the state’s Health Secretary Nila Mohanan said on Saturday. According to the Union Health Ministry’s guidelines, asymptomatic patients or those who have tested positive but displayed no symptoms can be discharged within ten days if they do not show any symptoms during the period. Symptomatic patients are, however, to be tested before the treating doctor decides the patient is cured and can be discharged. “In Goa we were testing all patients twice as we, like many other states, had chosen to continue with the earlier protocol of two consecutive negative tests before discharge. The Supreme Court has, however, ordered that the same protocol be followed across the country and we are bound by that,” Mohanan said at a press conference.“Asymptomatic patients will be discharged without a test in 10 days if they do not display any symptoms and be asked to maintain home quarantine. Symptomatic patients will be discharged with a single negative test,” she said.Covid-19 cases in Goa have soared in Goa since the beginning of June and its tally now stands at 754 cases of which 625 are active. Almost 95% of the patients are asymptomatic but are awaiting two consecutive negative tests in order that they can be discharged, as is the current protocol. Twenty nine fresh cases were detected on Saturday. A large chunk -- 505 of the 754 -- cases in Goa are either from or linked to Goa’s first containment zone that was notified earlier this month at Mangor Hill in the port town of Vasco da Gama. Since then Goa has three more containment zones where smaller areas have been cordoned off on account of clusters of cases being found.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-will-now-discharge-asymptomatic-patients-without-negative-test/story-S7KG8cEVbc39jFRvsDnPTP.html

This is the second death of a policeman in Karnataka due to Covid-19. The first one was an assistant sub-inspector attached to the V V Puram traffic police station.Police officials said the constable was among nine others who had recently tested positive for Covid-19. An ASI with the Wilson Garden traffic police station in Bengaluru has also reportedly tested positive for the infectious disease. The ASI is undergoing treatment at a designated hospital and the police station has been sanitised. His contacts too are being quarantined.Earlier this week, the Union health ministry appreciated Karnataka’s methods for Covid-19 management, which includes comprehensive contact tracing of Covid-19 positive cases and physical or phone-based survey that has covered more than 1.5 crore households in the state.The Karnataka government has over a period of time effectively traced and tracked each positive case and their contacts, hence successfully containing the spread of the infectious disease, the ministry said. Karnataka has one of the lowest coronavirus case counts in the country, compared to neighbouring Tamil Nadu, which with over 50,000 cases is now at second spot and among the worst-hit states by the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-records-416-new-covid-19-cases-a-head-constable-succumbs-to-infection/story-4SI06bRbqyTx7TeUb0v6qI.html
20-06-2020||India||Ladakh vs Doklam standoff: Same military commander, different tactics||Some time after President Xi Jinping landed in Ahmedabad on 17 September 2014, Prime Minister Narendra Modi broached the intrusion by Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Chumar. He asked President Xi to call off the People’s Liberation Army soldiers or he would have to assume that the intrusion was with his knowledge. PM Modi broached the subject again the next day, this time in Delhi. There had been no change in the ground situation in Chumar, a remote corner of the dry desert plateau of the western Himalayas. President Xi said he was “sad” that tensions between the armies had “cast a shadow” on his visit. The PLA backed down after President Xi wrapped up his India visit and reached Beijing.The Doklam stand-off happened three years later, when Indian soldiers stopped the Chinese from building a road into the Doklam bowl. This would have allowed the Chinese military to move vehicles in South Doklam towards the Jampheri ridge that overlooks the Siliguri corridor.Quite like the Chumar, the Doklam stand-off had been initiated by local commanders and was escalated to top military commanders. It ended eventually 73 days later after PM Modi flagged it to President Xi. Both leaders agreed that the standoff was not in the interests of the two nations, setting up the ground for thawing of the freeze in the relationship that led to the withdrawal from both sides.And this, by all accounts is how the Ladakh stand-off is so different from the ones in the past. There is one common denominator in Doklam and Ladakh stand-offs though. General Zhao Zongqi, the PLA’s Western Theater Command’s big boss.“Our understanding is that the Ladakh standoff was driven from the top, unlike the previous two stand-offs,” a senior government official familiar with the developments told Hindustan Times. For one, because the stand-off was preceded by violent scuffles in two military districts before the bloody face-off on June 15.The General behind Doklam and LadakhGeneral Zhao Zongqi is the PLA’s Western Theater Commander Gen Zhao, who has cultivated the reputation of being ruthless, joined the military when he was 15 and has consistently been moved up the ladderThe veteran of several wars has served 20 years in the Tibet Military District and is familiar with the Line of Actual Control under this district that includes the trijunction Bhutan-India-Tibet where the Doklam standoff took place.Gen Zhao, who was stationed as commander of the 52nd Mountain Infantry Brigade, in 1992, focused on strengthening Tibetan border posts. By the time he was out of the Tibet Military Region in 2003, he had moved up as a Major General.The 2016 restructuring of the PLA brought the entire Indian border under one command and not two as before.The first was a violent clash on May 5-6 between Indian and Chinese patrols on the northern bank of Ladakh’s Pangong Tso. Scores of soldiers - from the Indian side and PLA’s Xinjiang military district - were injured in the skirmish involving 250 men.A few days later, a second clash took place on May 9 when heated confrontation between Indian and PLA soldiers from the Tibet military district in north Sikkim’s Naku La area again led to violence. Four Indian and seven Chinese soldiers were injured during the face-off involving 150 soldiers.The third, on June 15, was the bloodiest and led to the first casualties along the LAC in 45 years.It is only at the level of the top commander that PLA soldiers under different military districts - the Tibet and Xinjiang military districts - would have responded with such striking similarity, an official said, referring to the skirmishes between soldiers in Sikkim and Ladakh in May.Both military districts report to Gen Zhao, who is believed to be directing much of the action along with the Line of Actual Control. Officials, however, indicate that it was unlikely that Gen Zhao, who is not part of the Central Military Commission but has President Xi’s ears, would be acting on his own.This would explain, a diplomat said, why the Chinese army appeared to be taking steps to prolong the stand-off even after foreign ministers of the two countries agreed to implement the understanding reached between top army officers on June 6 on de-escalation of troops from both sides. Or why the June 15 violent scrap still took place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ladakh-vs-doklam-standoff-same-military-commander-different-tactics/story-rFrk0WglxYF4RFHyeY5uHJ.html
20-06-2020||India||India again rejects China’s claim over Galwan Valley in Ladakh||India on Saturday again rejected China’s claim on Galwan Valley in Ladakh and reiterated that the violent clash of June 15 was triggered by Chinese efforts to build structures on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The external affairs ministry dismissed claims made by China’s foreign ministry in a statement issued late on Friday night regarding both sovereignty over Galwan Valley and the genesis of the clash on Monday night that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava said the position with regard to Galwan Valley was “historically clear”. He added, “Attempts by the Chinese side to now advance exaggerated and untenable claims with regard to Line of Actual Control (LAC) there are not acceptable. They are not in accordance with China’s own position in the past.”Srivastava further said the brawl of June 15 was the result of “violent actions” by Chinese troops after they were prevented by Indian soldiers from building structures on the Indian side of the LAC. He noted senior military commanders of the two sides had agreed during a meeting on June 6 on a process for de-escalation and disengagement along the LAC that “involved reciprocal actions”.“Both sides had agreed to respect and abide by the LAC and not undertake any activity to alter the status quo. However, the Chinese side departed from these understandings in respect of the LAC in the Galwan Valley area and sought to erect structures just across the LAC. When this attempt was foiled, Chinese troops took violent actions on June 15, 2020 that directly resulted in casualties,” he said.People familiar with developments said the term “just across the LAC” meant an intrusion into the Indian side of the disputed border but not at great depth.During his phone conversation with his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on June 17, external affairs minister S Jaishankar had conveyed India’s strong protest on “the events leading up to and on the violent face-off” on June 15. “He firmly rejected the unfounded allegations made by the Chinese side and the misrepresentation of the understandings reached between the senior [military] commanders. [Jaishankar] also underlined that it was for China to reassess its actions and take corrective steps,” Srivastava said.The two ministers agreed the overall situation would be “handled in a responsible manner” and both sides would “sincerely” implement the disengagement understanding of June 6.Srivastava said the two sides are in regular touch and early meetings of military and diplomatic mechanisms are currently being discussed. “We expect that the Chinese side will sincerely follow the understanding reached between the foreign ministers to ensure peace and tranquillity in the border areas, which is so essential for the overall development of our bilateral relations,” he added.The spokesperson reiterated that Indian troops scrupulously abide by the alignment of the LAC in all sectors, including in Galwan Valley, and the Indian side has “never undertaken any actions across the LAC”. He added Indian troops “have been patrolling” Galwan Valley for a long time without any incident and all infrastructure built by the Indian side is on its side of the LAC.However, Srivastava said that since early May, the Chinese side had hindered India’s normal and traditional patrolling pattern in Galwan Valley and this resulted in a face-off that was addressed by ground commanders in line with bilateral agreements and protocols. “We do not accept the contention that India was unilaterally changing the status quo. On the contrary, we were maintaining it,” he said.In mid-May, the Chinese side “attempted to transgress the LAC in other areas of the Western Sector” of border areas and these attempts were “invariably met with an appropriate response” from the Indian side. The two sides then engaged in discussions through diplomatic and military channels to address the situation.Late on Friday, China claimed Galwan Valley was on the Chinese side of the LAC and had been patrolled by its troops for “many years”. The claim was made in what was described as a “step by step account of the Galwan clash” by Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian.China’s People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) western command had in a statement issued on Tuesday initially claimed the region, saying: “The sovereignty of the Galwan River Valley has always been ours.”On Thursday, Srivastava had dismissed the PLA’s claim as “exaggerated and untenable”.The so-called “step by step account” by Zhao had further claimed that since April, Indian troops had “unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities at the LAC in the Galwan Valley”. He added that “India has gone even further to cross the LAC and make provocations”.Zhao claimed that on June 15, Indian troops “once again crossed the Line of Actual Control for deliberate provocation…and even violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went there for negotiation, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties”.Air Vice Marshal (retired) Manmohan Bahadur, additional director general of the Centre for Air Power Studies and a helicopter pilot with extensive experience of operations along the LAC, said: “When I first flew in that area in 1978, the maps clearly showed the Galwan Valley as Indian territory. The LAC was well east of the confluence of the Shyok and Galwan rivers.“There was never any question about the Galwan Valley and China’s claim on this region is untenable. There was no Chinese activity in the area, or we would have been briefed accordingly. It was well inside our side of the LAC.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-again-rejects-china-s-claim-over-galwan-valley-in-ladakh/story-Fs5UJitG7KsgpyV0DDWs5I.html
20-06-2020||India||Pharma firms in U’khand say suppliers hiking prices of Chinese raw materials after Galwan clash||Amid calls of ‘Boycott China’ after the killing of 20 Indian Army soldiers in Galwan Valley near Line of Actual Control (LAC) on June 15, price of raw material for the pharmaceutical industry has increased by upto 30% in the last four days, which could eventually result in costlier medicines, claimed pharmaceutical sector industry owners in Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh have hundreds of pharmaceutical companies and the two states account for almost half of the total medicines produced in India, which, in turn, accounts for 20% of the world’s pharma supplies by volume. According to Central government estimate, the pharma business in India is expected to grow to $ 0 billion by 2022 from about $22 billion in 2019.But, that can happen only if cheaper raw material from China comes without any hindrance, say industry leaders. Most of the raw material for the pharmaceutical industry is imported from China because of the lower cost than locally available salts, they said There are over 100 pharmaceutical manufacturers in Uttarakhand with majority of them operating from State Industrial Development Corporation of Uttarakhand Limited (SIDCUL) units of Haridwar and Rudrapur, US Naga district. Himachal has about 300 pharmaceutical factories, mostly situated in the Baddi Industrial town, close to Punjab-Haryana border.A leading pharmaceutical industrialists from Haridwar, on the condition of anonymity, said, “Since the episode in Galwan Valley in Ladakh and ensuing China boycott, the handful of big suppliers of the raw material, imported from China, have now increased its price by upto 30%. They are citing the ongoing situation behind it. But, it seems they are just trying to exploit the situation to earn undue profit.”“These suppliers are a group of 10-12 major players in the country who import the essential raw material and salts for the essential drugs from China and then supply to manufacturers across the country. They have total control over the supply and we are helpless before them. We have to buy the raw material at increased prices, no option. This will ultimately increase the prices for medicines for common man in market,” he said. The industrialist quoted above also said that the suppliers were seeking advance payment for supply the raw material. “Many of them are hoarding it and now asking for advanced payment. It is possible that they will come up with any other condition in next few days to benefit from the situation.”Another industrialist hailing from the sector in Haridwar, corroborated the claim, and said, “Right now we don’t have any other source (for raw material) other than China.”“About 80% of the raw material is imported from China which makes this boycott call totally impractical for us. We can’t import the material from Europe or US which is almost double the price of that from China,” he said. He said that even a basic drug like Paracetamol is based on raw materials from China. “Not only Paracetamol, raw material for all major antibiotics like Augmentin and vitamins come from China at lower prices which enables us to manufacture the drugs at economical prices. We have no option but to continue to import them from China as we have very few Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API) units in India, which can supply the raw material at comparable rates with China,” he said. Another pharmaceutical industrialist from Rudrapur in Uttarakhand said, “The ground reality is totally different than what people think while giving such (boycott China) calls.”“I have received the quotation of Paracetamol’s raw material at Rs 395/kg now which was Rs 200/kg two years ago. Everything needed for manufacturing Paracetamol from salt to wrapping sheets comes from China,” he said, claiming that if boycott China is implemented the country would face “severe” shortage of drugs, including live saving ones. “Our pharmaceutical industry is still about 10 years behind China’s.”Confirming the higher prices of material citing the tension between India and China, Anil Sharma, president of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association said, “There is some disruption in supply of raw material along with a rise in its price over last few days.”On the call to boycott Chinese products, Sharma said, “We are fully with the country’s sentiments but the ground reality is totally different. Doing so will affect us badly. The government should help in developing the APIs and alternative source of raw material to prevent us from relying on China.”Sunil Kumar, owner of Gujarat based Gaurang International, a major suppliers of raw material for pharma industries, confirmed that the prices of raw material has increased in the past few days because of the boycott call. “It is because we have now reduced the import from there in support of the country’s sentiments to boycott China. It is not that China has increased the prices but we have decreased the import resulting in its hike,” he said.Kumar, however, said that right now there is no alternative source country for raw material. “At present there is no other source of the raw material. But, it’s not like we can’t survive without it. We can put a stop to the import from China by developing APIs in India but that would take time. It can’t be done immediately,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pharma-firms-in-u-khand-say-suppliers-hiking-prices-of-chinese-raw-materials-after-galwan-clash/story-skWPPnfJRk26bkn7LC4ozK.html
20-06-2020||India||BJP widens gap in Rajya Sabha with 86 seats, Cong follows with 41||With the latest round of biennial polls to the Rajya Sabha over, the BJP-led NDA has further widened its gap with the Opposition in the House, with the saffron party now having 86 seats and rival Congress merely 41.The National Democratic Alliance now has nearly 100 members in the 245-member House. If the support of friendly parties like the AIADMK (9), BJD (9), YSR Congress Party (6), and several allied nominated members and smaller parties is counted, then the Modi government is unlikely to face any serious numerical challenge there. The BJP has relied on its strength in the assemblies coupled with defection from other parties, especially the Congress, to boost its strength in the House, where its numerical disadvantage often hindered the Modi government’s legislative agenda in its first term. The Election Commission had announced biennial polls to 61 seats, including 55 in March, but the process was delayed due to the novel coronavirus pandemic. With 42 members elected unopposed earlier, the Bharatiya Janata Party won eight, Congress and the YSR Congress four each and others three of the 19 seats that went to polls on Friday. The BJP won a couple of more seats than it could have on the strength of its numbers because of defection from several Congress legislators in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. In total, the BJP won 17, Congress nine, BJP ally JDU three, BJD and the TMC four each, AIADMK and DMK three each, NCP, RJD and the TRS two each, and others rest, official sources said. The crumbling strength of the Opposition, whose key pillars include the Congress, TMC and the Left, has been evident since last year after Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the BJP to its biggest ever victory as it bagged 303 seats in Lok Sabha election. It prompted a host of defections from the Opposition, including Rajya Sabha members of the Congress, TDP and the Samajwadi Party, to the BJP, and many non-NDA regional parties chose to back the government in Parliament on crucial issues. The Congress has accused the BJP of horse-trading, alleging that it had engineered defections from its ranks for political gains. The government managed big support in Parliament to its resolution to nullify Article 370 and key bills like the bifurcation of the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir into Union territories and criminal prosecution for instant divorce by Muslim men. The contentious Citizenship (Amendment) Bill was also passed in both the Houses. Out of the 61 new members, 43 are first-timers, which include BJP’s Jyotiraditya Scindia and Mallikarjun Kharge of the Congress. Both have been members of Lok Sabha, but lost in elections in 2019. Former prime minister H D Deve Gowda and former Lok Sabha deputy speaker M Thambi Durai have also been elected to Rajya Sabha. The legislative agenda of the Modi government in its first term was often hampered in Parliament due to the Opposition’s numerical superiority in the Upper House, and the Congress had more numbers than the BJP in first few years. However, the BJP’s impressive gains in the assembly elections, coupled with the Congress losing power in several states, resulted in slow but steady rise in the government’s numbers in the House. Though the below-par show of the BJP in state selections since 2018 has also meant that its goal of gaining a majority on its own in the Rajya Sabha remains far from being achieved.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-widens-gap-in-rajya-sabha-with-86-seats/story-PH1DPM0qDiqp4e7poVLxJK.html
20-06-2020||India||Plea in Delhi high court against LG’s five-day institutional quarantine order||A plea was filed in the Delhi high court on Saturday, challenging the order issued by Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal a day earlier, which had directed five-day institutional quarantine mandatory for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients. The order was, however, withdrawn on Saturday evening after the LG tweeted that ‘only those COVID positive cases which do not require hospitalisation on clinical assessment and do not have adequate facilities for home isolation would be required to undergo institutional isolation’. The plea, filed by an advocate, Nancy Roy, said that the directions issued by the L-G are harsh, compelling Covid-19 patients to undergo five-day institutional quarantine at a time, when the Arvind Kejriwal-led Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is unable to provide an adequate number of beds and nurses for all those, who are in dire need of hospitalisation because of the viral outbreak.The petition, which is likely to come up for hearing next week, said that the Delhi government has already issued press releases to the effect that its entire manpower is stretched, and on top of that, they would have to arrange massive quarantine centres for housing thousands of asymptomatic patients.The plea stated that the order is likely to deter people from undergoing Covid-19 tests for fear of being sent to the government-run quarantine centres.It also cited that “more hospital beds” would be required for these institutional quarantine cases, whereas the critical patients would be left unattended for want of beds.The petition pointed out that the new rule would “overburden isolation centres, which are unhygienic, and could lead to a further spread of the contagion”. It is likely to create more chaos, the plea added.It also contended that the L-G’s order would put senior citizens under tremendous physical and mental hardship.The plea prayed for a quashing of the June 19 order issued by L-G Baijal, as the head of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).Earlier on Saturday, the Delhi government also opposed the L-G’s order. CM Arvind Kejriwal, who met the L-G in the afternoon, questioned the move.“If the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is allowing home-isolation facility for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases across the country, why are different rules being implemented in Delhi?” he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-delhi-high-court-against-lg-s-five-day-institutional-quarantine-order/story-hGMbMWqxtD2bTfFypNC6GJ.html

The total number of coronavirus patients in the state now stand at 3,039 including 1,450 active cases, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan told reporters.Fifty seven people recovered and were discharged from hospitals, the CM added.Saturday was the second consecutive day when Kerala recorded more than 100 positive cases. One hundred and eighteen people had tested for Covid-19 on Friday. The state has witnessed a rapid rise in the number of coronavirus patients with the return of expatriates in the last few weeks.Given the rising numbers of cases among those returning from abroad, the Pinaryai Vijayan government has proposed to make carrying Covid-free certificates mandatory for the expatriates. While the government had initially said these certificates were required only by those taking chartered flights from West Asian countries, it later modified the order to include everyone flying in from abroad.The state government told the Centre on Thursday that it is ready to provide TrueNat testing kits to check expats before they board flights. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said the state will provide these kits to Indian missions where testing facilities are not available. He said the state chief secretary has written to the foreign secretary about this.The state has recorded 21 deaths from Covid-19 so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-records-highest-single-day-spike-in-covid-19-cases-breaches-3-000-mark/story-LBkphb5GBqsFSC7Ku0CgdP.html
20-06-2020||India||Not enough reverse migrants from west UP to reap benefits of PM’s Garib Kalyan campaign||All the 23 districts in the relatively prosperous western Uttar Pradesh (UP) have lost out on the Central government’s ambitious Rs 50,000-crore “Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyan,” which was launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday morning. The scheme is aimed at boosting employment and livelihood opportunities for migrant workers, who have returned to their native villages amid the easing of nationwide lockdown restrictions that were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak.The scheme, which will run for 125 days, is available for only those districts in the country that have received over 25,000 migrant workers.The western UP’s 23 districts have failed to make the grade for the Centre’s new job scheme because of the lack of the number of migrant workers required to qualify for the initiative. The Central government has identified 116 districts across six states under this scheme, including UP, Madhya Pradesh (MP), Bihar, Jharkhand, Rajasthan, and Odisha, in a bid to create infrastructure through public works that support job creation in the migrant returnees’ villages.In UP, 31 districts, mostly from the eastern part of the state, have made the cut for the scheme. They are Siddharthnagar, Prayagraj, Gonda Maharajganj, Baharaich, Balrampur, Jaunpur, Hardoi, Azamgarh, Basti, Gorakhpur, Sultanpur, Kushinagar, Sant Kabir Nagar, Banda, Ambedkarnagar, Sitapur, Varanasi, Ghazipur, Pratapgarh, Rae Bareli, Ayodhya, Deoria, Amethi, Lakhimpur Kheri, Unnao, Shrawasti, Fatehpur, Mirzapur, Jalaun, and Kaushambi districts.“Eastern UP has been traditionally known for migrant workers, unlike western UP, which is comparatively more prosperous and known for local job creation,” said Suresh Chandra, additional chief secretary (labour).A report, prepared by the office of the relief commissioner and seen by HT, showed that over 26 lakh migrant workers have returned to their respective districts between May 1 and June 11.In some of the western UP districts, such as Ghaziabad, Shamli, Hapur and Meerut, around 1,000 migrants or less than that have returned since the easing of the lockdown restrictions.Ghaziabad brought out the rear with only 289 returnees.On the contrary, eastern UP districts such as Gorakhpur and Prayagraj received over one lakh migrant returnees each.Siddharthnagar topped the state with 1,60,455 and Lucknow accounted for 3,449.The state Panchayati Raj department had collected the data on the migrant returnees during lockdown 1:0 in end-March, when over 5.5 lakh returned home, largely from Delhi-national capital region (NCR).Altogether over 31 lakh migrants have returned to the state to date, the officials added.IN FIGURESTotal no of migrant workers returned to UP between May 1 and June 11: 26,014,49Total no of migrants returned to UP during lockdown 1:0 in end-March: 5,525,64Total no of migrants released from transit camps in UP after screening between May 1 and June 11: 2,578,397Total no of migrants living in transit camps after screening as on June 11: 31,776Total no of migrants sent to dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and care centres after screening till June 11: 20,245Districts receiving most migrants (May 1 to June 11)District Migrant ReturneesSiddharthnagar - 1,604,55Prayagraj - 1,40,331Gonda - 1,179,35Gorakhpur - 1,057,71Sant Kabir Nagar - 1,033,07Districts receiving least/no of migrants District Migrant Returnees Ghaziabad - 289Hapur - 535Shamli - 847 Meerut - 1,001Mathura - 1,844(Source: UP Government)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-enough-reverse-migrants-from-west-up-to-reap-benefits-of-pm-s-garib-kalyan-campaign/story-vHN1w8UCxVXa7H9ldSZLeM.html

The total number of samples tested to detect coronavirus patients stood at 8,61,211, the state health department said.Tamil Nadu reported 2,396 fresh Covid-19 cases and 38 deaths on Saturday, taking the total number of coronavirus cases in the state to 56,845. There are at present 24,822 active Covid-19 cases in the state and the death toll has climbed to 704 with the addition of the 38 fatalities, according to health department data.Tamil Nadu is the second worst-hit state by the coronavirus pandemic, preceded only by Maharashtra. Capital city Chennai has a huge concentration of coronavirus patients and is deemed to be a Covid-19 hotspot.With the strict lockdown enforced in parts of Tamil Nadu entering the second day today,Chief Minister K Palaniswami has described the restrictions as a ‘speed breaker’, saying the curbs were being used to further augment detection of Covid-19 cases in Chennai by conducting more door-to-door surveys and fever camps.Several steps are in place in the state for both early identification and treatment of people who test positive for the infection, the CM said after inspecting quarantine amenities at the Guru Nanak School in Velachery in Chennai city.Tamil Nadu has about 83 testing centres, the highest in the country, with 45 in government and 38 in private sectors.The fever camps in Chennai have been increased to 527 on Friday from about 350 in the recent past and those with Covid-19 symptoms are being treated, the chief minister said.The 12-day lockdown, which came into effect on Friday, is being implemented strictly in Chennai and in parts of neighbouring Chengelpet, Kancheepuram and Tiruvallur. Only essential services are allowed and vegetable shops and groceries can function only from 6 am to 2 pm. Ahead of the curbs, relaxations were in place for most segments with the exception of only schools and other educational institutions.The Tamil Nadu Police said action against violators of the lockdown will be taken and their vehicles would be seized if anyone was found violating the norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-strict-lockdown-tamil-nadu-tests-33-231-samples-its-highest-in-a-single-day/story-aHOaS8dMyr9TNQPliyCw6J.html

The cops are also being told about the various kinds of treatments these children may need and whom to contact for their rehabilitation.“The RPF has been rescuing children from traffickers for a long time. But Covid-19 and lockdown have made the situation complicated. Children are being targeted again and need to be protected,” said Mayank, Inspector General, RPF.The RPF needs to be more vigilant in the current situation, he said.“The Covid-19 pandemic compelled nearly 40 million people to migrate from one place to another. This population includes a large number of children. Unfortunately this situation has made many of them soft targets for traffickers as children are being lured to move to other cities for good earnings, said Shivendra Pandya, UNICEF director in Bihar.“It is for the first time that RPF has collaborated with UNICEF for protection of children at railway platforms. The UNICEF has planned online orientation sessions to sensitize RPF officials and the first session was held on June 16 with the RPF of Sonepur division. In the next three four days we will interact with the RPF units of Samastipur, Dhanbad, Pandit Deen Dayal Upadhyay and Danapur division,” said Gargi Saha from child protection unit of UNICEF Bihar.Among the districts which have witnessed large cases of trafficking of children are Gaya, Nawada, Araria, Supaul, Katihar and Darbhanga, she said.The RPF said it has rescued 2,163 children from 2017 till May 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rpf-unicef-tie-up-in-bihar-to-save-children-from-trafficking-during-covid-pandemic/story-aRTkHMdJSojMS8o6MMquUJ.html

The chief minister said they had requested the Centre to put the exercise on hold in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, but now they have decided to explore legal options as they did not get any adequate response from the Union government. Soren told reporters that the state government has moved the apex court as it is a huge policy decision and there was a need to take into confidence the respective state governments. “Mining has always been a contentious issue in the state. After a long time, a new process is being adopted, which will reinstate the system out of which we came out. Even in the existing system, the locals, landowners could not get their rightful entitlements. There are several issues related to land and displacement in the state,” Soren said. “Several trade unions are out on the streets against the decision. We had requested the Centre not to take any decision in haste. But since we did not get any response to show that the process put in place is transparent and in the interest of the state, we decided to move SC,” he added. Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday launched the auction of 41 coal blocks under the new regime, under which private miners would be sharing revenues with the government.The blocks are located across Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra.Soren said the union government should have got a fair assessment of adverse social and environmental impact conducted in the state before implementing the new policy. “It seems the Centre is doing this in haste. It is difficult to understand as the entire world is under lockdown. The Centre is expecting foreign investment, but there are several issues including curbs on foreign travel now. Currently, the demand is also low as many industries are shut. So, I don’t find this process of any help now,” Soren added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jharkhand-moves-sc-challenges-auction-of-coal-blocks-for-commercial-mining/story-cm7pwl91QY3HUpShiVoxAK.html
20-06-2020||India||Babies with Covid-19 may have only mild illness, mostly with fever: Study||Researchers, including an Indian-origin scientist, have shown that infants under 90 days of age who tested positive for Covid-19 tend to be well, with little or no respiratory symptoms. According to the study, published in The Journal of Pediatrics, fever was often found to be the primary or only symptom in new born babies infected with the novel coronavirus. “While there is limited data on infants with Covid-19 from the US, our findings suggest that these babies mostly have mild illness and may not be at higher risk of severe disease as initially reported from China,” said study lead author Leena Mithal from the Northwestern University in the US. “Most of the infants in our study had fever, which suggests that for young infants being evaluated because of fever, Covid-19 may be an important cause, particularly in a region with widespread community activity,” Mithal said. However, she added that evaluation for bacterial infection in young infants with fever remains important. In the study, the researchers assessed 18 infants, none with a significant medical history. Of the 50 percent of these infants who were admitted to the hospital’s general inpatient service, none required oxygen, respiratory support, or intensive care. According to the study, indications for admission were mainly clinical observation, monitoring of feeding tolerance, and ruling-out bacterial infection with empiric intravenous antibiotics in infants younger than 60 days. Of the infants admitted to the hospital, six out of nine had gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms such as poor feeding, vomiting, and diarrhea. The scientists said upper respiratory tract symptoms of cough and congestion preceded onset of GI symptoms. They said young infants also had notably high viral loads in their nasal specimens despite mild clinical illness. “It is unclear whether young infants with fever and a positive test for SARS-CoV-2 require hospital admission,” Mithal said. “The decision to admit to the hospital is based on age, need for preemptive treatment of bacterial infection, clinical assessment, feeding tolerance, and adequacy of follow-up,” she added. Mithal believes there may be opportunities to utilise rapid SARS-CoV-2 testing to determine disposition of clinically well infants with fever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/babies-with-covid-19-may-have-only-mild-illness-mostly-with-fever-study/story-XTjAfakY99XVADEJif11DK.html

We are hopeful to procure by this December. The radio collar will help to track movement of the wild elephants and we can take measures to push them back to forests and thus preventing them from entering human habitations,” Sharma said.Total 50 man-elephant conflict incidents were recorded in the state in 2019-20 with one death. “ We have settled 30 of such cases so far. Rest will also be settled soon,” he said. Currently, the state has 40-50 wild elephants and 62-65 captive elephants. Two groups of elephants are seen in Khowai district and Gomati district, according to Forest Department’s record. Earlier, West Bengal, Uttarakhand, Chhatisgarh and other states used radio collar to minimize conflict. The state government also took a beekeeping project in agricultural lands to prevent elephant attacks and also taken steps to grow bamboo and banana plantations in the forests , which are elephant fodder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-to-procure-first-radio-collar-device-to-curtail-man-elephant-conflict/story-EmT6M9lEtIqzwzhQXYoSwK.html

Many hotels situated in bigger cities in India have already started to operate for business. It is almost 13 days and the industry is waiting for an OK from the Government to start operating all these units,” Nilesh Shah, the president of the Travel and Tourism Association of Goa, said. The Goa Tourism Department had called for hoteliers to submit applications to reopen as well as an undertaking that they will follow all the guidelines and standard operating procedures as mandated by the Union Ministry of Home Affairs. Hoteliers had started submitting applications from June 8.Earlier, Director of Tourism Menino D’Souza had said that the Department would then inspect each hotel to ensure compliances before allowing them to restart. “All hotels which are willing to comply with the guidelines, have to apply to the department. We will verify whether they are in a position to comply with the guidelines,” D’Souza had said. The TTAG has however, claimed that despite more than 200 hotels applying to reopen, none have been given the go ahead to do so. “Out of thousands of hotels waiting to reopen we have only about 200 who have applied for permission to reopen. Up to now there has been no go ahead given by our state Government to reopen,” Shah added. Tourism, which is a major revenue earner in Goa, has come to a complete standstill following the lockdown to control the Covid-19 pandemic. The TTAG has claimed that the direct and indirect economic impact of the tourism industry is estimated at 40% of the state’s GDP.The industry has also sought that bars and restaurants also be allowed to reopen in the state as hotels “cannot successfully (reopen) unless the bars and restaurants are given permissions to reopen as well.”Restaurants have been allowed to reopen in the state with only half the capacity but aren’t allowed to serve alcohol.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-hoteliers-fume-as-govt-drags-feet-over-applications-to-resume-business/story-eV4UcJOnGMUX7hCz1j0bDM.html
20-06-2020||India||Covid-19 testing declines in Odisha even as cases continue to rise||Odisha’s coronavirus disease (Covid-19) positive cases may have gone up by around 80% between May 19 and June 19, and the contagion has spread across all 30 districts in the state, but the daily test count has gone down significantly in the interim. The low test count is being attributed to a host of factors such as the malfunctioning of machines and skewed demand and supply ratio among laboratory technicians and frontline workers combating the pandemic.Consider this: Odisha had reported 1,052 Covid-19 positive cases and 22 of the 30 districts in the state were in the pandemic’s clutches on May 19, including 74 cases in a single day and 4,536 tests were conducted on that day alone.A month on, Odisha’s Covid-19 tally stood at 4,836 and the contagion has spread across all the 30 districts. On June 19, 17 laboratories in the state conducted 3,167 tests and the day’s count was 179 fresh Covid-19 positive cases.The state has added over 3,700 or 80% of its total Covid-19 positive cases in exactly a month’s time, triggering panic among the worried state government officials.On June 18, they drew the Supreme Court’s (SC) attention that they anticipate a further spread in the viral outbreak, and pleaded a stay against organising the annual Rath Yatra festival in Puri next week -- a major draw for tourists and pilgrims -- while raising concerns over the maintaining of social distancing norms. The apex court has acceded to the state government’s plea.The state government has also resorted to mandatory weekend shutdowns in 11 worst-hit districts, including Bhubaneswar, in a bid to contain the spread of the viral outbreak.There has also been a growing concern over the mismatch between the daily spike in Covid-19 positive cases and the number of tests being conducted.The laboratories across the state tested 63,709 samples between May 1 and 19 and 868 tested Covid-19 positive, while the corresponding figure between June 1 and 19 was 57,040 and 2,432 positive.The average daily tests between May 1 and 18 stood at 3,540, but came down to 3,169 between June 1 and 18, despite the growing number of Covid-19 positive cases.In May, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had announced that the daily test count would go up to 15,000 from June following the influx of migrant workers from other states amid the nationwide easing of lockdown restrictions, which were enforced from March 25 to contain the spread of the pathogen.Though the daily test count crossed 5,000 for a few days following the CM’s announcement, including 5,612 on May 16, the figure has since then gone down significantly, as the laboratories are conducting tests anywhere between 2,500 and 3,800 on any given day. Last week, Shalini Pandit, director, National Health Mission (NHM), Odisha, defended the low daily test count while citing revised guidelines issued by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), which stated that only symptomatic and high-risk contacts need to undergo tests.“We’ve conducted over two lakh tests so far. Besides, the tests per million population in the state is higher than the national average. Positivity rate per lakh population in the state is 9.3%, as compared to Maharashtra (88%), Delhi (205%) and the national average of 25%,” she said.Epidemiologists, however, refused to buy into her arguments and warned against a spike in the viral outbreak, which is likely to have been precipitated by the rising graph of Covid-19 positive cases and an inversely proportionate daily test count.Odisha had reported one Covid-19 positive case in every 250 people tested until end-April. While currently, the corresponding figure stands at 1:26.“This indicated that there is a viral outbreak, which calls for more testing. As per the health protocol, usually about 1% of the population suffers from influenza-type illnesses. At least 4.2 lakh people in Odisha must be in that bracket, who are in dire need of undergoing tests, along with the migrant returnees, who are symptomatic. Aggressive testing, tracing and treating is the only mantra to effectively contain the Covid-19 pandemic,” said an epidemiologist of a government-run hospital, requesting anonymity.Virologist Jacob John, a former principal of Christian Medical College, Vellore, Tamil Nadu, said aggressive tests could only help ascertain the spread of the contagion.“People living outside the quarantine centres need to be tested in a bid to come to the conclusion that there’s no community transmission. While this has been the emerging trend in Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra and Delhi, how does one know that’s not the case with Odisha?” he asked.State officials – albeit off the record -- attributed the low test count to malfunctioning machines and the lack of an adequate number of laboratory technicians because of a high daily volume of swab samples.Odisha, however, has failed to overcome this endemic problem, unlike Assam, which is conducting 10,000 Covid-19 tests daily.“In June, the Cobas 6800 machine at Regional Medical Research Laboratory in Bhubaneswar malfunctioned for over 10 days, which led to a major disruption in conducting tests. Similarly, the RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction) machine at Institute of Life Sciences in Bhubaneswar could not function for a few days due to non-technical issues. The laboratory technicians, too, are overworked because of an exponential rise in the volume of swab samples. Each sample takes up to 10 hours to test and a technician can only do that much. The state health authorities have been instructing the district collectors to send samples in lesser quantity because of these infrastructural constraints,” said a health official, requesting anonymity.However, the turnaround time for the availability of a test result has come down from five days in mid-May to 48 hours. But slip-ups are being routinely reported such as a government driver in Puri district had to wait for five days in June until his report showed that he has tested Covid-19 negative. “You could well imagine my mental condition. I was worried for all those days, as I was constantly thinking who all I might have infected,” said the driver.Many people, who run the risk of contracting SARS-CoV-2, which causes Covid-19, are also complaining about the state government’s laxity in denying them the opportunity to undergo tests.For instance, over 80 migrant returnees had staged a sit-in at a high school in Gajapati district – the worst-hit in Odisha – in May as they were not allowed to undergo tests.They claimed that though they were made to spend a fortnight at a quarantine centre, their swab samples were not collected.Similar complaints have come from other quarantine centres in Balasore, Ganjam and Bhadrak districts. “A few of us had been running a fever and were symptomatic. But our swab samples were still not collected,” said a migrant worker at a quarantine centre in Balasore district’s Bahanaga block.Accredited social health activist (ASHA) and Anganwadi workers, who are at the frontline of combating the pandemic such as the collection of swab samples, are finding themselves in a bind because of the growing workload and the skewed demand and supply ratio.In early June, an ASHA worker, Savitri Swain, was assaulted by a group of fishermen from neighbouring Andhra Pradesh in Paradip because they did not want to be quarantined.While in May, ASHA and Anganwadi workers had faced the ire of people at a containment zone in Rourkela town, when they had gone to collect their swab samples.“It’ a real challenge. Many of us don’t have proper personal protective equipment (PPE) units unlike the doctors at dedicated Covid-19 hospitals. We’ve only face masks and hand gloves to protect us from the pathogen. I start my day’s work, dreading when I’d get infected. I’ve no option, but to carry on,” said a health worker, who did not wish to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-testing-declines-in-odisha-even-as-cases-continue-to-rise/story-TRGBwmQMqXw1lu0GTQhf8N.html
20-06-2020||India||‘Decision to resume international flights depends on other countries’: Aviation Minister||India resuming international flights will depend on other countries being open to receive flights, Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri said on Saturday. At the same time, he was hopeful of resuming domestic flights to full capacity by year end.“Any suggestion that international air traffic has opened up and we are the only ones not to open up needs a reality check. The exact time when we will resume international flights depends on other countries to be open to receive flights,” he said.India has suspended international passenger flights since March 22, in a bid to contain the spread of Covid- 19.The minister said that international flights operations depend on airspaces being open and a border acceptance from other countries. “Many countries decided that they were not going to allow nationals from other countries except their own. We also went with the same position,” Puri said. Giving details the minister said, entry is conditional in the US, UK, France, China, UAE and Singapore. “You cannot have normal civil aviation operations under such conditions,” he added.The minister added that in the absence of a decision on resumption of international flights, India is left with no option but to continue “evacuation and repatriation” flights under managed and controlled conditions.He was referring to the government’s initiative in bringing back Indians struck abroad due to Covid-19 pandemic. The Centre had launched the Vande Bharat Mission for this purpose on May 6.The minister said that till date 275,000 Indians have been brought back to the country - 109,000 have returned via the Centre’s Vande Bharat Mission through the national carrier Air India while 143,000 expatriates have been brought back through private carriers.The aviation minister said that during the phase 3 and phase 4 of the mission, private domestic airlines have been approved to operate 750 international flights to repatriate people stranded amid the coronavirus pandemic. The government was constantly trying to expand both domestic and Vande Bharat flights, the minister said, adding that the domestic flight ops would be ramped up.“At present we have allowed only 33% flights to operate and flights are not operating in full capacity even now. We will open more routes where there is more demand. We are ready to take it to up to even 40-45% capacity, Puri added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decision-to-resume-international-flights-depends-on-other-countries-aviation-minister/story-f3yrMlstbb1iFFJhLWXOkO.html
20-06-2020||India||‘Air India a first-class asset’: Hardeep Singh Puri on debt-ridden national carrier||Civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri on Saturday said that national carrier Air India is a first-class asset for the country, whether leading from the front in evacuating stranded Indians from China’s Wuhan or successfully carrying out the Vande Bharat Mission.“I have never been as hopeful and confident on Air India, divestment or disinvestment whatever you choose, as I am now. Air India is a first-class asset. Whether it is for evacuation of people from Wuhan or elsewhere, Air India has been at the heart of it,” the civil aviation minister said.Increasing debt and mounting losses has made the national carrier’s financial position shaky with the government planning to sell its entire stake in Air India Ltd. The government had earlier this year, in January, announced the stake sale in the debt-ridden airline after an attempt to auction a majority stake almost two years ago failed to draw any bids.ALSO READ| ‘Decision to resume international flights depends on other countries’: Aviation Minister“Air India and Air India Express are a great entity. They have lucrative slots and bilateral rights. The average age of the aircraft is eight years which in civil aviation terms means a young fleet,” Puri had said earlier.Air India and Air India Express have nearly 51% share of international traffic from India and their employee cost is significantly lower than other international airlines. However, despite the government infusing aid to the tune of Rs 30,500 crore previously, the cash-strapped airline has been incurring losses.More recently, the aviation sector has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent lockdown imposed by the Centre to curb the spread of the infectious disease. After being suspended for almost two months from the end of March, the government resumed domestic flights from May 25, but placed lower and upper limits on airfares depending upon the flight duration. These limits are likely to be in place for a period of three months, the government had announced.The civil aviation minister said the government is planning to add more flights as part of the Vande Bharat Mission in the 3rd and 4th phase to bring back more Indian nationals possibly stranded abroad. Air India CMD Rajiv Bansal also indicated that in phase 4 of the Vande Bharat Mission from July onwards, the airline will have 650 flights. “We are tuning our schedule as per the demand,” Bansal said.The minister on Saturday expressed hope of resuming domestic flights to full capacity by the end of 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-india-a-first-class-asset-hardeep-singh-puri-on-debt-ridden-national-carrier/story-5oj71OrO5IoU0nav2x5eeK.html

The Puri Rath Yatra was last held up nearly three centuries ago when Mohammed Taqi Khan, deputy governor of Odisha, attacked the Jagannath temple, forcing the shifting of the idols to Ganjam district.“This would be the world’s first digital Rath Yatra which would cover six continents in 24 hours on June 23 and June 24. It would be named ‘Mercy in Wheels’. There would be 108 rathas,” said Subrata Das, communication officer of ISKCON’s headquarters at Mayapur in south Bengal.Also read: Chief servitor of Lord Jagannatha asks SC to allow Puri Ratha Yatra without public participationThe ISKCON Rath Yatra was started by the organization’s founder Srila Prabhupad in San Francisco in 1967.“Being a year of pandemic, devotees won’t be able to go out on the streets and celebrate the festival on a grand scale. Hence the idea was conceived so that Lord Jagannath with Baladev and Subhadra would visit the house of devotees across the world,” said Jayapataka Swami, who conceived the idea of digital Rath Yatra.One has to register for free to become a ‘yajaman’ and receive a code and a link with a scheduled slot with details of the coordinator. Each rath would be pulled by one leader from ISKCON.“On June 23, celebrations will start at Mayapur and could be seen on social networking sites. The rathas would then roll out at around 10 am in 108 directions. The devotee, who has the code, will be able to offer the arti and bhog at the slot allotted to him. The rath would then move to the next yajaman. This will continue till 7:30 am till the next day,” said the spokesman.ISKCON authorities are expecting around 30,000 families to participate in the digital Rath Yatra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iskcon-plans-world-s-first-virtual-rath-yatra-across-six-continents-during-covid-19-pandemic/story-FC3iY13U9xUpgxsdbOUEfO.html
20-06-2020||India||Has PM Narendra Modi given clean chit to China by saying no intrusion in Indian territory, asks Chidambaram||Former Finance Minister P Chidambaram on Saturday targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his statement that there had been no intrusion (Chinese) in Indian Territory and asked if the PM has given a “clean chit” to China for the Galwan Valley face-off which claimed the lives of 20 Indian Army personnel.Taking to Twitter, the Congress leader asked five questions to the Central government. One of them enquired why was there a clash between troops on June 16-17 if there was no foreigner in Indian territory.“Prime Minister said there is no foreigner (meaning Chinese) in Indian territory. If this is true, what was the fuss about May 5-6? Why was there a fight between troops on June 16-17? Why did India lose 20 lives?” Chidambaram asked.PM said there is no foreigner (meaning Chinese) in Indian territory. If this is true, what was the fuss about May 5-6? Why was there a fight between troops on June 16-17? Why did India lose 20 lives?During the all-party meeting on Friday PM Modi had said that “neither is anyone inside our territory nor is any of our post captured” and 20 brave soldiers made the supreme sacrifice for the nation during a violent clash with Chinese troops in Galwan Valley and also taught a lesson to those “who had dared to look towards our motherland”.Chidambaram also questioned the government over the need to hold talks about “disengagement” of troops by China and India if there was no intrusion.“If there was no intrusion or violation of LAC, why was there so much talk about “disengagement” of troops by both sides? If there was no intrusion by Chinese troops at all, what did the Corps Commanders talk about on June 6? Was it about the weather?” he wrote.Quoting Foreign Minister S Jaishankar, he asked if no Chinese troops had crossed the LAC into Indian territory, why did the Foreign Minister’s statement refer to “restoration of status quo ante”?“Has the Prime Minister given a clean chit to China? If so, what is there to negotiate with China? Why are the Major Generals negotiating and about what?”, he asked.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/has-pm-narendra-modi-given-clean-chit-to-china-by-saying-no-intrusion-in-indian-territory-asks-chidambaram/story-73vfpXyq7Ek4tUXRLW2OzN.html
20-06-2020||India||‘Mischievous interpretation’: Govt on PM Modi’s remarks at all-party meet||The government on Saturday said Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s comments at an all-party meeting, called to discuss the situation along the India-China border, have been misinterpreted.On Friday, PM Modi told an all-party meeting that there has been no intrusion into Indian territory. “Attempts are being made in some quarters to give a mischievous interpretation to remarks by the Prime Minister at the all-party meeting yesterday. The Prime Minister was clear that India would respond firmly to any attempts to transgress the LAC. In fact, he specifically emphasised that in contrast to the past neglect of such challenges, Indian forces now decisively counter any violations of LAC (“unhe rokte hain, unhe tokte hain”),” read a statement from the Prime Minister’s office (PMO).After the PM categorically said on Friday that “neither has anyone entered Indian territory, nor is anyone present in Indian territory currently, and nor is any Indian post captured”, opposition parties had criticised the statement. Twenty Indian soldiers died in the line of duty in brutal hand-to-hand combat with the Chinese troops on Monday.The Congress party on Saturday said PM Modi’s concluding statements at the all-party meeting had contradicted the earlier statements made by the Army chief, the defence Minister and the foreign minister. The party asked if no Chinese troops had crossed the LAC, what was the reason for the face-off. The government, however, rebutted the opposition‘s criticism and said that the all-party meeting was informed that this time Chinese forces have come in much larger strength to the LAC and that the Indian response is commensurate. “As regards transgression at the LAC, it was clearly stated that the violence in Galwan on June 15 arose because Chinese side was seeking to erect structures just across the LAC and refused to desist from such actions,” the government said in a statement.The statement went on to say that the PM’s observations that there was no Chinese presence on our side of the LAC pertain to the situation as a consequence of the bravery of the Armed Forces. “The sacrifice of the soldiers of the 16 Bihar Regiment for the attempts of the Chinese side to erect structures and also cleared the attempted transgression at this point of the LAC on that day. The words of the PM, “ those who try to transgress our land were taught a befitting lesson by the brave sons of soil”, succinctly summed up the ethos and values of the Armed Forces”, the statement read.The union government said an unnecessary controversy is being created to lower the morale of the soldiers for defending the borders. “What is Indian territory is clear from the map of India. This government is strongly and resolutely committed to that,” it added. Any unilateral change of the LAC will not be allowed, the government added.The government further asserted that all parties extended support to the government and the forces.“The predominant sentiment at the meeting was of unequivocal support to the government and the armed forces at a time of national crisis. We are confident that the unity of the Indian people will not be undermined by motivated propaganda,” said the government. The PM had assured the opposition parties that whether it is deployment, action or counter action Indian forces – be it on land, in the air or in water are doing everything to protect our borders. The infrastructure development in border areas has gained in pace over the past years, he said, adding it has strengthened our patrolling capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unnecessary-controversy-govt-on-pm-modi-s-comments-at-all-party-meet/story-Fe2UgMKw3ZBBZ1abD2APVM.html

It is expected to increase to Rs 1,510 crore by October, he said.The official also informed that 69 extra high tension sub-stations and transmission lines were installed in the last three years to reduce the transmission loss.An amount of Rs 6324.62 crore is pending against bills from different categories of consumers, the meeting was told.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-cm-says-returnee-migrants-to-get-jobs-in-power-firms/story-fZONRPhpLC4RAzbWXP67rO.html
20-06-2020||India||Contact tracing still a crucial tool to curb spread of coronavirus, say experts||Amid the frantic search for a vaccine for the coronavirus infection, contact tracing of patients continues to be a crucial tool to contain the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic, experts have suggested. The Union health ministry too has emphasized on the need for contact tracing of those who test positive for Covid-19, to ensure that the health infrastructure of the country is not overwhelmed. The health ministry has advised state governments to adopt containment practices to suit local needs and pay attention to contacts of those who test Covid-19 positive, which would in turn help to curb the spread in their specific states. What is Contact Tracing?Contact tracing is the process of alerting unwitting people to the danger of infection so that they can take appropriate action. When someone tests positive for any disease, health workers interview that individual about the people they can remember interacting with over the previous few weeks. Those people are then warned about possible exposure and asked to get a test done. If they turn out to be infected, their contacts are also informed. It’s a public health technique that has been used for decades globally to contain tuberculosis and measles epidemics, as well as HIV/AIDS, according to a report by The Washington Post.ALSO READ | Contact tracing apps won’t elicit honest symptom reporting: Harvard epidemiologistCloser home, the health ministry has appreciated Karnataka’s methods for Covid-19 management, which includes comprehensive contact tracing of Covid-19 positive cases and physical or phone-based survey that has covered more than 1.5 crore households in the state.The Karnataka government has over a period of time effectively traced and tracked each positive case and their contacts, hence successfully containing the spread of the infectious disease, the Ministry said. Karnataka has one of the lowest coronavirus case counts in the country, compared to neighbouring Tamil Nadu, which with over 50,000 cases is now at second spot and among the worst-hit states by the pandemic.Karnataka has also widened the definition of ‘contact’ to include both high risk and low risk categories as defined by the Union health ministry.ALSO READ | Covid-19: Phones may hold key to catching up with the pandemicIn Maharashtra, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Friday asked district collectors to appoint a task force of expert doctors to curb Covid-19-related deaths, and warned against complacency in tracing patients and their contacts.“After the easing of lockdown restrictions earlier this month, there has been an increase in the number of patients in some districts. Tracing patients and their contacts expeditiously is very important and the only solution. There should be no complacency in contact tracing,” the Maharashtra chief minister said.Contact tracing and proper testing may go a long way in helping to curb the sudden surge in Covid-19 cases in India. According to The Washington Post report, mitigation as a method uses just enough of both techniques to slow down the disease for some time, but not enough to eradicate it totally. Suppression, on the other hand involves a hike in testing capacity and aggressive contact tracing strong enough to interrupt the chain of transmission.Suppression, if countries can follow it, is obviously the better choice to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic, according to the report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/contact-tracing-still-a-crucial-tool-to-curb-spread-of-coronavirus-say-experts/story-holBfzivKlh12y9dhObzjN.html

20-06-2020||India||Chief servitor of Lord Jagannatha asks SC to allow Puri Ratha Yatra without public participation||Janardhan Pattajoshi Mohapatra, who is the hereditary chief servitor of Lord Jagannatha of the Jagannatha Temple at Puri, Odisha, moved the Supreme Court on Friday seeking recall of the top court’s June 18 order which had barred holding of the annual Hindu festival of Rath Yatra this year in view of the threat posed by Covid-19 pandemic.Mohapatra submitted that the Rath Yatra has an unbroken tradition and is an essential practice of the Jagannatha temple which the temple administrators should mandatorily observe under all circumstance.“Any interruption in the observance of this mandatory religious practice affects the very sanctity of the temple and all its future rituals as well as the faith of millions of devotees across the world who understand and revere the significance of the Rath Yatra,” the application stated.Also read: Puri Shankaracharya, priests want SC to review stay on Rath YatraMohapatra, therefore, suggested that instead of imposing a blanket ban on the Rath Yatra and the festival and rituals associated with it, the festival can be held without public participation by imposing a curfew in Puri and closing the city borders.“If a curfew is imposed on the day of Rath Yatra and the Rathas are pulled with the help of earthmovers, the entire journey of Lord Jagannatha - from the Shri Jagannath Temple to Gundicha mandir - of around 2.8 kilometres can be completed in less than one hour. An absolute bar on the performance of such an essential ritual is not necessary to protect public health,” the application filed through advocate Suvidutt Sundaram stated.The Rath Yatra is a festival associated with Lord Jagannatha. It was scheduled to commence this year on June 23. The festival lasts for 10 to 12 days and involves a procession of chariots containing the deity Lord Jagannatha, his brother Lord Balabhadra and sister Devi Subhadra.The Supreme Court had ordered a stay on the festival and all activities associated with it this year stating that allowing the same would lead to a congregation of more than 10 lakh devotees in violation of social distancing norms which could compromise public health and safety amid the Covid-19 pandemic.This order was passed in a petition filed by an NGO, Odisha Vikas Parishad, which had moved the top court pointing out the public health risk involved if the annual event is allowed to take place.The NGO referred to the Tablighi Jamaat incident - a religious congregation held in mid-March at the Nizamuddin area in Delhi - which led to a spurt in Covid-19 cases across the country after people from the Muslim community from all across the country and even from abroad had attended the event.“Of about 4,400 Covid-19 positive cases in India as on April 7, nearly one third were related to the religious gathering at the Markaz, Delhi. Thus, in order to avoid any similar instances of outbreak of Covid-19 cases, a religious gathering in the nature of Rath Yatra festival ought to be avoided,” the petition had stated.“Having regard to the danger presented by such a large gathering of people for the Rath Yatra, we consider it appropriate in the interests of public health and safety of citizens who are devotees to restrain the respondents (state and district authorities and the managing committee of Jagannatha temple) from holding the Rath Yatra this year,” the bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde had ordered.The court had also directed that no such Rath Yatra should be allowed in any other part of Odisha.Mohapatra pointed out that the Rath Yatra has been conducted under all circumstances since time immemorial including during the Spanish Flu pandemic in 1918.“The Rath Yatra is an essential, mandatory, integral and indispensable religious practice which has scriptural sanction. Non-conduct of the Rath Yatra has consequences not only for the sanctity of the temple but also for the society in general,” his application said.He, therefore, suggested that the state government may make an announcement that the Rath Yatra will be conducted with absolutely no participation from the public and strict penal consequences will follow if any attempt is made to enter Puri during the Rath Yatra.“Arrangements for live-broadcasting of the Rath Yatra may be allowed like every year to enable crores of devotees across the world, including the residents of Puri, to have Darshan of the three deities”, the plea said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-covid-19-pandemic-chief-servitor-of-lord-jagannatha-asks-sc-to-allow-puri-ratha-yatra-without-public-participation/story-bJvBzCkYWqLuub2oHZ3IWJ.html

20-06-2020||India||In Madhya Pradesh, BJP MLA, wife test Covid-19 positive, cause flutter among lawmakers||A BJP MLA and his wife tested positive for Covid-19 causing a flutter in the BJP state unit and Congress both and also among the assembly staff as the MLA had attended the BJP legislature party meetings on Wednesday and Thursday and cast his vote during the Rajya Sabha polls held at the assembly premises on Friday, according to legislators from Congress and BJP.The MLA happens to be the second legislator in the state to be infected with Covid-19. Earlier, a Congress MLA tested positive for the virus. He turned up in a personal protective equipment (PPE) kit in the state assembly on Friday afternoon to cast his vote. He, however, had been given the facility of a postal ballot that he didn’t go for. The state Congress has accused the BJP MLA of putting in peril the life of other legislators including chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan who chaired the BJP legislature party meetings and also cast his vote in RS polls, state assembly secretariat staff and the selected media people who were allowed to cover the Rajya Sabha polls amid the Covid-19 situation.State Congress spokesperson Ajay Yadav said, “We have learnt that the BJP MLA got samples of his wife and himself tested for coronavirus two days back but still he attended the BJP legislature party meetings, mingled with other MLAs and BJP leaders. He has committed a grave offence by concealing the information about his health and he should be immediately booked for spreading the virus knowingly as was done in several other cases in the state.”The MLA confirmed that he and his wife had tested positive for Covid-19. However, he said, they went for the test on Friday only.“When my wife complained about fever we got our samples tested on Friday. Now we are going to be hospitalised,” the MLA said over phone.State BJP spokesperson and MLA Rameshwar Sharma said, “I can’t comment on whether the MLA knew about his health conditions but we are alert about our health and consulting doctors as to what to do. However, certain MLAs have gone to hospitals too for their test today. Another concern is many MLAs who came from other districts to Bhopal to cast their votes have returned to their homes. If any of these MLAs test positive for coronavirus, his family members too will be prone to contracting the disease and so will the others who are in contact with him.”Congress MLA and former minister PC Sharma said, “Certainly we were all almost together in a closed area during the poll. I was the election agent for the party candidate Digvijaya Singh. In that capacity, I met the assembly staff too and received the certificate of election from the returning officer in presence of several others. Even otherwise, we put signatures on papers that might have been touched by the infected MLA too. Some MLAs have gone to the government hospital for their test. We are also consulting doctors.”State assembly principal secretary and returning officer for Rajya Sabha election AP Singh said, “We all followed all required safety measures including social distancing norms and the state assembly premises was sanitised on Friday. But it’s a matter of concern if the MLA removed his face mask to talk to others or some legislators and others might have come close to him. That’s why we are looking at the CCTV footage to find out if the infected MLA had removed his face mask while interacting with other MLAs and to know how many MLAs and assembly staff came in contact with him or stood close to him.”As many as 206 MLAs cast their votes on Friday during the Rajya Sabha polls. They include the Congress MLA who tested positive for coronavirus. He, however, appeared in a PPE kit to cast his vote. The other MLAs include 107 from BJP including chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and five ministers, 91 from Congress, four independent, 2 BSP and 1 SP MLAs. The Rajya Sabha candidates Digvijaya Singh from Congress and Sumer Singh Solanki from BJP were also there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-madhya-pradesh-bjp-mla-wife-test-covid-19-positive-cause-flutter-among-lawmakers/story-BMVIJrnW7j5VROr6L3CYQM.html

20-06-2020||India||21 Bihar policemen dismissed over 2016 Gopalganj hooch tragedy||Twenty-one policemen in Bihar were dismissed on Friday in connection with the hooch tragedy in Gopalganj four years ago, in which 16 people had died, officials said.Three sub-inspectors, five assistant sub-inspectors and 13 constables were among those sacked.The tragedy, which took place on August 15, 2016, was the first major incident reported in Bihar after the state government declared total prohibition in April that year.Earlier, 15 policemen, including the SHO of Town police station under which the tragedy took place in Khajurbanni locality, were suspended on the charge of dereliction of duty. The deaths were initially considered as mysterious as the autopsy reports did not highlight any trace of liquor in some of the bodies but the state government clarified that the 16 died after drinking poisonous liquor.People in Khajurbani, a settlement of Mahadalit Pasis and some OBC groups, use a flower, Mahua, to brew illicit liquor. Most of the 16 people who died in the suspected hooch tragedy are said to have consumed liquor from this area on the night of August 15.The entire police staff of Town police station was suspended hours after the incident and faced departmental enquiry, according to the police headquarters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/21-bihar-policemen-dismissed-over-2016-gopalganj-hooch-tragedy/story-XBaqaHtRwVVb7WGoaD80KI.html
20-06-2020||India||India posts PM Modi’s remarks on Ladakh face-off, China’s WeChat app deletes it||A popular Chinese social media app, WeChat, has removed updates by the Embassy of India (EoI) on the current border conflict including Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement on the clash that left 20 Indian Army soldiers dead.The reasons given for the removal of the posts include divulging state secrets and endangering national security.The updates published on WeChat, a popular social media app, included Modi’s remarks on the India-China border situation, the phone call between the Indian and Chinese foreign ministers held on Thursday and a statement by the external affairs ministry’s (MEA) spokesperson.A day earlier, the EoI had to issue a clarification on its Chinese Twitter-like Weibo account after the same statement by the MEA spokesperson was deleted.Embassy officials had to then clarify to its readers that the post wasn’t removed by them, and re-published a screen-shot of the statement in Chinese.While the statements put on WeChat were in English, the EoI’s Weibo account was carrying a Chinese version of the Indian ministry’s version of the events at the border in eastern Ladakh.The sudden removal of the Indian government’s posts from its official accounts on Chinese social media comes in the backdrop of the violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley region earlier this week.While 20 Indian Army soldiers died, the Chinese government has so far not revealed the casualties suffered by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) though official Chinese media have admitted that there were casualties on both sides.Followers of the EoI’s official account on WeChat first noticed the discrepancy on Saturday morning.On clicking two of the statements on WeChat, the message that pops-up says the posts were “…deleted by the author”.It was learnt that the EoI did not remove any of the posts.For the third post on WeChat, the MEA spokesperson’s statement, the message says: “Unable to view this content because it violates regulations”.It then gets serious because of the nature of the regulations the statement is said to have violated – endangering national security.The message continues: “This content was reported and confirmed by the platform of the following:” before it says in Mandarin: “Suspected of violating relevant laws, regulations and policies”.As it then turns out, according to WeChat, the spokesperson’s statement was removed because it carried “…contents prohibited by laws and regulations of the state.”The long list of regulations include: “endangers national security, divulges state secrets, subverts state power, or undermines national unity, inciting hatred, disseminating false information, inciting illegal assembly, demonstration or gathering of people to disturb public order”.Prime Minister Modi also has a Weibo account, which was opened when he came to China in May, 2015.The Hindustan Times has reached out to WeChat for a comment on its decision to take down the EoI official posts.WeChat is among the most popular social media apps in China, and claims to have more than 1 billion users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-social-media-deletes-modi-s-speech-india-s-statement-on-border-row/story-j53yLW7WpXFpKOHxlrMgVP.html

The meeting was called upon to discuss Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal’s latest directive which makes 5-day institutional quarantine mandatory for all Covid-19 patients. “Currently, there are more than 10,000 people under home isolation and there are only 6,000 beds at quarantine centres, where will we accommodate all the people?” the chief minister said during the meeting. Kejriwal also said that the move will shift the entire focus from moderate and serious patients of Covid-19 to those who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. Chief Minister said if home isolation ends in Delhi there will be chaos.

Should our primary focus be on the serious patients or the asymptomatic or mild persons who actually need no medical treatment as such?” Kejriwal reportedly asked the L-G in the meeting.Kejriwal also said that move will lead to people avoid getting tested for Covid-19 owing to the fear of being whisked away to quarantine centres. “Why are there different rules for Delhi when the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is allowing home-isolation for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases across the country?” the CM reasoned. The L-G’s order on Friday added that after the five-day institutional quarantine, asymptomatic Covid-19 patients will be sent for home quarantine.“Five days institutional quarantine of each case under home-quarantine is to be made mandatory and, thereafter, (they) will be sent for home-isolation, except in cases where symptoms require further hospitalization,” Baijal said in his order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/there-will-be-chaos-where-will-we-accommodate-people-kejriwal-on-5-day-institutional-covid-19-quarantine/story-PZyzm47zqtMp74pb6yt9dN.html

Rahul Gandhi, one of the first senior leaders to question PM Modi over his remarks had tweeted: “PM has surrendered Indian territory to Chinese aggression. If the land was Chinese: Why were our soldiers killed? Where were they killed”.Also Watch | ‘China didn’t enter our territory…’: PM Modi at all-party meet on Ladakh clash The government statement called this criticism an attempt to give a “mischievous interpretation” to PM Modi’s remarks.The PMO said Modi’s remarks had focused on the June 15 face-off between Indian and Chinese soldiers at Galwan that led to the loss of lives of 20 Indian soldiers.“The Prime Minister’s observations that there was no Chinese presence on our side of the LAC (Line of Actual Control) pertained to the situation as a consequence of the bravery of our armed forces,” the statement said.“The sacrifices of the soldiers of the 16 Bihar Regiment foiled the attempt of the Chinese side to erect structures and also cleared the attempted transgression at this point of the LAC on that day,” the PMO added .The government said the all-party meeting was informed that this time Chinese forces have come in much larger strength to the LAC and that the Indian response is commensurate. “As regards transgression of LAC, it was clearly stated that the violence in Gallan on 15 June arose because Chinese side was seeking to erect structures just across the LAC and Refused to desist from such actions,” said the PMO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mischievous-interpretation-says-government-on-congress-barbs-over-pm-modi-s-ladakh-stand-off-statement/story-3XvXY3KsiamUzN0CJ6u0yH.html
20-06-2020||India||Air Force chief was asked if he has a message for enemy. His reply||India is not expecting a war with China on the border issue, but is fully battle-ready if such a situation arises, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria underscored on Saturday.“We are not at war with China, but we fully geared up to meet any contingency arising out the recent conflict on the Line of Actual Control (LAC),” Bhadauria said, while interacting with reporters after reviewing the combined graduation parade of 123 Indian Air Force cadets at Air Force Academy at Dundigal on the outskirts of Hyderabad.Replying to a query on his assessment of the situation on the LAC in the wake of his visit to the airbases in Leh and Srinagar in the last two days, the Air Chief Marshal said the army was in full control of the situation at Galwan valley, the site where 20 Indian soldiers died in the line of duty while fighting the Chinese troops.“The army has already given a statement to this effect. At the same time, our Air Force is also ready to supplement the efforts of the army by deploying additional battalions to meet the contingency, if required,” he said.Asked whether the more fighter aircraft would be moved to Leh and Srinagar in view of his visits, Bhadauria said the IAF has airbases at several strategic locations in the country, not just Leh. “We shall assess the situation and go about with our deployments. However, we have stepped up our deployments after the recent conflicts with China post-May,” he said.To another question, he said the Air Force was capable of handling the situation in high altitude regions, but for tactical reasons it cannot disclose where and how the deployments would be made. “We shall do and we are doing it as per the requirements,” he said.Asked what message he wants to send to the adversaries, Bhadauria said India did not want to send any message to its adversaries but would always be prepared to defend its territories. “Why should I send any message to the adversaries,” he said. The air force chief said the IAF cadets who had graduated on Saturday would be directly reporting to their assigned squadrons and units in view of the current situation so that they would get into action whenever it was required.Earlier, addressing the newly graduated cadets, Bhadauria said the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers at Galwan valley in Ladakh would not go in vain.“It should be very clear that we are well prepared and suitably deployed to respond to any contingency. I assure the nation that we are determined to deliver and will never let the sacrifice of our braves of Galwan go in vain,” he said.The forces were well prepared and suitable equipment was in place, he said, adding that the face off at Ladakh was a small snapshot of what the armed forces were required to handle at a short notice.In spite of unacceptable Chinese actions after agreements reached during military talks and resultant loss of life, all efforts are being made to ensure that the current situation at the LAC is resolved peacefully, he said.“Please join me in paying tribute to Colonel Santosh Babu and his brave men who made the sacrifice while defending the LAC in Galwan Valley. The gallant actions in a highly challenging situation have demonstrated our resolve to protect India’s sovereignty at any cost,” Bhadauria said.The IAF chief conferred the ‘President’s Commission’ to 123 graduating trainees, including 19 women cadets, of various branches. The ceremony comprised presentation of ‘Wings’ and ‘Brevets’ to the Flight Cadets who successfully completed Flying and Navigation training respectively.The parade was followed by a brief, but spectacular air show by Pilatus, Kiran Hawk, Chetak helicopters and an aerobatic display by Surya Kiran Aerobatic Team (SKAT) of the IAF.The graduating IAF cadets, officers and all the dignitaries who attended the ceremony wore face masks and maintained social distance in view of the Covid-19 pandemic. The parents of the cadets were also not allowed to view the parade this time because of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-at-war-with-china-but-fully-prepared-says-air-force-chief-bhadauria/story-Lhs3mpn1DfBIGcWkmMTUnM.html

20-06-2020||India||Kejriwal opposes L-G’s 5-day mandatory institutional quarantine order, says ‘will lead to evasions’||Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday opposed Lieutenant governor Anil Baijal’s recent order on a mandatory five-day institutional quarantine for “each case” under home quarantine in the city, senior government officials said. Kejriwal’s comments came during a meeting with the Delhi Disaster Management Authority on Saturday noon.Kejriwal also said that the move will shift the entire focus from moderate and serious patients of Covid-19 to those who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms. “This is a time when our main focus should be on increasing the recovery rate and keep fatalities at a bare minimum. Should our primary focus be on the serious patients or the asymptomatic or mild persons who actually need no medical treatment as such?” Kejriwal reportedly asked the L-G in the meeting.An official, who was part of the meeting, confirmed that chief minister Kejriwal said that when the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) is allowing home-isolation for asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic cases across the country, “why were different rules being implemented in Delhi?” The chief minister is learnt to have told the L-G that people would avoid getting tested for the disease fearing they would be sent off to an institutional quarantine facility for five days.

Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said they failed to reach an agreement and will meet again at 5 pm.No consensus could be reached on the issue of Covid-19 treatment rates in private hospitals. Sisodia said that the Centre has recommended reduction of rates only for 24% of the beds in private hospitals whereas the Delhi government wants this to be 60%.

20-06-2020||India||Villages have shown the way during coronavirus pandemic: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Saturday villages in India stood firm in the face of the huge menace of coronavirus pandemic, which has shaken the whole world and ravaged cities. “The whole world was shaken by the great crisis of corona but you stood firm. The way corona has been fought in the villages of India, it has taught a big lesson to the cities,” PM Modi said. The Prime Minister made the comments while speaking during the launch of the Rs 50,000 crore Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan, a dedicated programme to create jobs for migrant workers who returned home during the coronavirus-induced lockdown across the country.“Just think, in a country with more than six lakh villages, in which more than two-thirds of India’s population, about 80 to 85 crore people live, you have effectively prevented the coronavirus infection,” he added.The Prime Minister pointed out that this population is more than that of all the countries of Europe as well as entire America, Russia and Australia.“It is a great thing that such a large population confronted corona with such courage and with so much success. The awareness of our rural India has worked behind this success,” he said.Among those he praised were those working on the ground, village heads, Anganwadi workers, ASHA workers, Jeevika didis.“Even if nobody lauds you, I hail you. You have done a tremendous job of saving thousands and millions of people from corona. I bow to you,” he said.India’s tally of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) stands at 395,048 and 12,948 people have succumbed to the respiratory disease, Union health ministry data showed on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/villages-have-shown-the-way-during-coronavirus-pandemic-pm-modi/story-TBNtJO0qJm0Zs3ruNjNTBO.html
20-06-2020||India||‘Why were they killed, on whose land?’ Cong rakes up India-China border row||The Congress party on Saturday said that it supports the Central government and the defence forces but also demands answers to a host of questions on the recent violent face-off between India and China in Ladakh that killed 20 Indian Army soldiers. “Will the prime minister clarify how does he plan to ensure that their sacrifice does not go in vain?” Congress spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said during a press briefing on Saturday. “We therefore seek answers to the questions with a view to re-double our commitment and present a picture of unity and solidarity. We ask these questions while reiterating our total support to the Government of India and India’s defence forces. The defence of the nation and its territorial integrity are dear to the heart of every Indian,” he said.  Between May 5 and June 6, what was the issue on which local Indian commanders were talking to their Chinese counterparts?

PM Modi claims China never entered our territory. 20 Indian soldiers were killed in Galwan Valley. Will PM Modi clarify why they were martyred? On whose land were they martyred?” Sujrewala said. The Congress spokesperson said that China has blamed India for the clashes and has re-asserted its claim to the entire Galwan Valley. “What is the government’s answer to this claim? Will the Government of India reject this,” he added.  If no Chinese troops are in Indian territory, why did Foreign Minister Mr Jaishankar’s statement and other statements of MEA demand the "restoration of status quo ante"?: @PChidambaram_IN #ModiSurrendersToChina“Between May 5 and June 6, what was the issue on which local Indian commanders were talking to their Chinese counterparts?

He also said that the move will require 90,000 additional beds which will be a problem for the administration. “As per our calculation, Delhi needs 15,000 beds by June 30 but after this order, now we need 90,000 beds by June 30. From where will we get 90,000 beds?” Chadha said. As per yesterday's order, all #COVID19 patients, symptomatic or asymptomatic, will be kept in quarantine centres for 5 days.

The Kejriwal government has also asked the L-G to reconsider his decision.The national capital is struggling with a rapid surge in Covid-19 cases with the number of infections jumping to 53,116 on Saturday.

20-06-2020||India||Not just India’s Galwan, China has a long list of territorial disputes||Military commanders of Indian and Chinese armies have been holding several rounds of talks to resolve the impasse at the four stand-off points in eastern Ladakh as the soldiers. The meetings at Galwan region’s Patrolling Point 14 - the site of a bloody clash on Monday evening that killed 20 Indian soldiers and an unspecified number from the Chinese side - have helped lower the tension at the border but from all available indicators, the two sides are far from a resolution. Patrolling Point 14 is in control of the Indian army but the Chinese People’s Liberation Army soldiers - which now claims Galwan valley as Chinese territory - are standing close by maintaining the face-off.India’s border dispute with China that blew up this week takes the shine off the many agreements between the two sides not to let differences turn into disputes. At Galwan, President Xi Jingping’s PLA is trying to create a new one.Also Read: Ladakh isn’t South China Sea, will not allow status quo to change: OfficialAnd it isn’t only on its border with India that President Xi’s China has manufactured a problem. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, speaking during an online conference on democracy, attacked China for its “rogue” attitude in its entire neighbourhood. The US Navy has deployed its 300,000 tonne aircraft carriers to the Pacific Ocean on June 15. This is the first biggest deployment of US super-carriers - USS Ronald Reagan, USS Theodore Roosevelt and USS Nimitz - since 2017. While the US has not attributed any security motives to the deployment, it is quite evident that the move is to counter Chinese aggressive posture over Taiwan.BhutanThe last stand-off between India and China was over Beijing’s encroachment and construction activities at Doklam, at the India-Bhutan-Tibet tri-junction, that continued for 73 days. China had backed out as part of the peace deal between India and China but according to multiple reports, was back at its game. There have been similar such encroachments, construction activities and cases where Chinese patrols have intimidated Bhutanese graziers from accessing pasture lands within Bhutan territory in other sectors of Bhutan-China borders.South China SeaChina has been flexing its muscles for complete control over the resource-rich South China Sea. China’s claim to the waters based on “historic rights” was turned down by a 2016 arbitration ruling but that hasn’t stopped China from amping up efforts to militarise the zone.That South China sea is one of the world’s busiest maritime trade routes that serves as a passage for annual trade worth $ 3.5 trillion implies that this territorial claim impacts not just its smaller neighbours, but a larger number of countries.To be sure, China has island and maritime border disputes with Taiwan, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines and Vietnam in the South China Sea and its extension. The disputes include islands, reefs, banks and other features in the South China Sea including Spratly Islands (with Vietnam, Philippines, Malaysia, Brunei, Taiwan), Paracel Islands (Vietnam), Scarborough Shoal (Philippines), and Gulf of Tonkin (Vietnam).In addition, China claims the entire Taiwan and its controlled islands as its own.Eastern China SeaChina has Exclusive Economic Zone disputes with North Korea, South Korea and Japan in the Yellow Sea (North Koren/South Korea) and East China Sea (South Korea/Japan). In addition, China claims Senkaku/Diaoyu Islands of Japan. The area again sees a huge intra-region and global trade and Chinese claim would spill over the region and affect many more countries beyond the immediate region.NepalAround the same time that Kathmandu had objected to a fresh map issued by India last year, Nepal’s Survey Department had accused China of having encroached Nepali land in northern districts of Humla, Rasuwa, Sindhupalchowk and Sankhuwasabha. There were protests against China in Nepal after this survey report was leaked but Nepal’s communist party didn’t escalate the border dispute with China that has been pouring billions of rupees in investments into the country and kept the spotlight firmly on India’s map instead. China has also initiated an exercise to measure the height of Mount Everest and installed telecommunication equipment to provide 5G services on it. In May, the state-run China Global Television Network claimed Mount Everest as part of China in a tweet but deleted the post after outrage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-just-india-s-galwan-china-has-a-long-list-of-territorial-disputes/story-DN10LXdhdjljSVgvsLpeSM.html
20-06-2020||India||PM Modi launches Rs 50,000-crore Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan, a Rs 50,000 crore dedicated programme to create jobs for millions of migrant workers who returned home during the coronavirus-induced lockdown across the country.The Prime Minister launched the programme, which will be a “focused campaign” and run in “mission mode” for 125 days across 116 districts in six states to help migrant workers get jobs in their home states, via video conference.The programme, which started from Telihar village of Bihar’s Khagaria district, will cover India’s 116 districts across Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha.“The country understands your emotions and your needs. The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan starting from Khagaria in Bihar is a major tool to fulfil this need and emotion,” PM Modi said.The Prime Minister also interacted with several people who came back home to Bihar from several places across the country, including Delhi, Gurugram, Rajasthan. Union minister of rural development Narendra Singh Tomar and Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar were among those who were present during the launch.The largest number of migrant workers (three million) have returned to Bihar since the Covid-19 pandemic swept through the country leaving daily-wage labourers jobless in big cities.The government has said the programme, aimed to boost livelihood opportunities in rural India, will “create durable infrastructure along with boosting employment opportunities”.Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said on Thursday that the move will not involve new budgetary allocation—the 25 schemes will be front-loaded, utilising in 125 days the allocation meant for the year.Sitharaman had said that in 125 days, nearly 25 schemes will be brought together to reach saturation and will include Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, Gram Sadak Yojna, Jal Jeevan Yojna and PM Gram Sadak Yojna among others.Laying of fibre optics cable, railway works, rurban mission jobs, sanitation works, waste management, poultry, farm ponds and training through Krishi Vigyan Kendras will be given to the migrant workers under the programme.Twelve different ministries or departments—rural development, panchayati raj, transport, mines, drinking water, environment, railways, petroleum, new and renewable energy, border roads, telecom and agriculture—will participate in the programme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-launches-rs-50-000-crore-garib-kalyan-rojgar-abhiyaan-to-generate-jobs/story-xo36Sp8aBFn4nagoNx9AEO.html
20-06-2020||India||Pak-origin Canadian arrested, faces extradition for role in 26/11 Mumbai attacks||Tahawwur Rana, a Pakistani-origin Canadian sent to US jail for his role in planning the 2008 Mumbai attacks, has been arrested after being freed from prison to face extradition to India.Rana, 59, a known close associate of David Coleman Headley - one of the main conspirators behind the attacks on India’s financial hub that killed 166 people - was serving a 14-year sentence in a Los Angeles federal prison when he was granted an early release last week because of poor health and being infected by the coronavirus.However, he never got out of prison as he was arrested to face extradition to India, US prosecutors told the Associated Press. Indian officials said they had learnt Rana was rearrested on June 10.Officials familiar with developments said a US attorney informed the district judge in Los Angeles about India’s standing request on Rana’s extradition who is wanted in India for terror charges.Also read: Arms-laden Pak drone shot down by BSF along International Border in J&K’s KathuaA senior National Investigation Agency (NIA) officer, who didn’t want to be named, said “It’s a positive development after over 11 years. This means his extradition hearings will now take place”.Former home secretary GK Pillai, who played a key role in the investigation of the Mumbai attacks and coordinated with the US, said there was a pending Indian extradition request for Rana.“There is a standing Indian extradition request for Rana and that will still be applicable,” he told HT.An NIA team that visited the US in late 2018 was informed by the department of justice (DoJ) that it was convinced with India’s charges against Rana.India’s had requested Rana’s extradition on charges of forgery and criminal breach of trust as he used his firm for making documents that were used by Headley during his surveillance missions in Mumbai. These charges were accepted by US prosecutors and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and they are inclined to honour India’s request.Rana, a former Pakistan Army physician-turned-businessman, had been convicted by a court in Chicago in 2011 of providing material support to the Lashkar-e-Taiba for the Mumbai attacks, and for backing a planned attack on a Danish newspaper that printed caricatures of Prophet Mohammed in 2005. Headley was linked to both incidents and was convicted during the same trial.At the time, US reports had said American prosecutors had failed to prove that Rana directly supported the attacks in Mumbai and he was cleared of this more serious charge by the jury at the trial in Chicago.Rana’s legal team had claimed he had been misled by Headley, who was Rana’s friend from high school. Rana had been accused of allowing Headley to open a branch of his Chicago-based immigration law firm in Mumbai to act as a front for Headley’s surveillance activities in India’s financial hub ahead of the devastating attacks that also injured hundreds.He was also accused of allowing Headley to pose as a representative of the same firm when he went to Denmark for surveillance ahead of the planned attack.At the time, US prosecutors had said Rana knew Headley had trained with the LeT and that Headley had shared information with Rana of his surveillance activities in Mumbai and of the Taj Mahal Palace hotel, where LeT members later killed dozens of people.Headley was sentenced to 35 years in prison but can’t be extradited to India under a plea deal. Indian investigators have been allowed to question him.Pakistani authorities had arrested seven men, including LeT operations commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi, for the Mumbai attacks though their trial in an anti-terrorism court never made any headway. Lakhvi was subsequently released on bail and his current whereabouts aren’t known.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-origin-plotter-tahawwur-rana-behind-26-11-mumbai-attacks-arrested-faces-extradition/story-JAd01AdFnQyfZT3QWztbnO.html
20-06-2020||India||Pakistan-origin Canadian rearrested in US on India’s extradition request for role in 26/11 Mumbai terror attacks||Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana has been rearrested in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people were killed, according to the US prosecutors. Rana, 59, was recently released from jail on compassionate ground after he told a US court that he has tested positive for the Covid-19. He was rearrested in Los Angeles on June 10 following an extradition request by India, where he is a declared fugitive, they said. Assistant US Attorney John J Lulejian told the court that the Indian government, as per the bilateral Extradition Treaty signed in 1997, has requested the arrest and detention of Rana with a view towards his extradition. Lulejian said India has informed the United States that Rana is being prosecuted for a number of offences, including the conspiracy to commit murder, in violation of Sections 120B and 302, and murder in violation of Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). Rana has also been charged with conspiracy to commit forgery for the purpose of cheating and conspiracy to use as genuine a forged document or electronic record. He made an initial court appearance on June 11. On Friday, US District Judge Jacqueline Chooljian in the US District Court, Central District of California, scheduled his bond hearing for June 30. His attorney has been asked to submit his plea by June 22 and the federal government’s response is due by June 26. Lulejian said that the offences for which Rana’s arrest warrant was issued are covered by Article 2 of the India-US Extradition Treaty. An arrest warrant was issued against Rana in India by Poonam A Bamba, District and Sessions Judge, Special Court of India’s premier investigation agency National Investigation Agency (NIA), on August 28, 2018. According to the federal prosecutors, between 2006 and November 2008, Rana conspired with his childhood friend David Coleman Headley, also known as “Daood Gilani”, and others located in Pakistan to assist Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) and Harakat ul-Jihad-e-Islami, both US-designated terrorist organisations, to plan and carry out the Mumbai terrorist attacks. Rana was first arrested in Chicago on October 18, 2009. Thereafter he went to trial in the US District court for the Northern District of Illinois where Headley testified for prosecution. The jury convicted him of one count of Conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism in Denmark, and one count of providing material support to LeT. The jury, however, acquitted Rana of one count of conspiracy to provide material support to terrorism in India. Harry D Leinenweber, US District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois, sentenced Rana to a 168-month prison term. On May 7 this year, Rana filed a motion for compassionate release in the US District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. In his motion, Rana claimed that he has tested positive for the Covid-19, and his precarious medical conditions put him at the extreme risk of life-threatening complications. Rana also asked the court to reduce his sentence and allow him to return to Canada. Rana is a Canadian citizen, but he was a residence of Chicago and running a business in the city at the time of his arrest. His petition was rejected by Rebecca R Pallmeyer, Chief US District Judge for the Northern District of Illinois on May 18. He filed a second petition -- Renewed Motion for Compassionate Release -– on June 4. Five days later on June 9, Judge Leinenweber granted Rana’s motion, reduced his sentence to time served and ordered his immediate release, while leaving intact all other aspects of his criminal conviction. Rana was serving his sentence at the Federal Correctional Institution Terminal Island in San Pedro, California. Given that he is a Canadian citizen, the Department of Homeland Security has filed an immigration detainer for him with the Bureau of Prisons. He was formally rearrested the very next day on June 10. The Bureau of Prisons is currently holding Rana at that facility pursuant to the immigration detainer. Luiejian told the court in his submission dated June 10 that a formal request for extradition from the Indian government, supported by the documents specified in the Treaty, will be presented and finalised within the time required under the Treaty. The 2008 Mumbai attack was one of India’s most horrific terrorist attacks in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed and over 300 injured as 10 heavily-armed terrorists from Pakistan created mayhem in Mumbai on November 26, 2008. Pakistani national Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, the lone terrorist captured alive, was hanged to death on November 21, 2012.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistan-origin-canadian-rearrested-in-us-on-india-s-extradition-request-for-role-in-26-11-mumbai-terror-attacks/story-tmpFhu3SIS8iZrWW7ZXXLI.html
20-06-2020||India||‘Rise above petty politics’: Amit Shah hits back after Rahul Gandhi’s Ladakh remark||Union home minister Amit Shah on Saturday tweeted a video of the father of an Indian Army soldier, who was injured in the violent face-off with Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, to criticise Congress leader Rahul Gandhi over his allegations against the government.Amit Shah’s tweet came after the former Congress president posted a video on Friday of the father talking about the attack on Indian soldiers along the contested areas of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.Twenty soldiers, including a commanding officer of the 16th Bihar Regiment, were killed in Galwan valley on Monday night after the skirmish with China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA). Many others were injured as well.After that Rahul Gandhi again attacked Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday over his remark that neither has anyone entered Indian territory, nor is anyone present in Indian territory currently, and nor is any Indian post captured, alleging that the PM has “surrendered” Indian territory to Chinese aggression.“A brave armyman’s father speaks and he has a very clear message for Mr. Rahul Gandhi,” Shah tweeted.“At a time when the entire nation is united, Mr. Rahul Gandhi should also rise above petty politics and stand in solidarity with national interest,” he said. It’s sad to see senior GOI ministers reduced to lying in order to protect the PM.Don’t insult our martyrs with your lies.#BJPBetraysOurJawans pic.twitter.com/uwrmj1oxq1The father of the injured soldier, who fought in Galwan Valley scrap, also asked the Congress leader to “not to indulge in politics.”“The Indian Army is a strong army and can defeat China. Rahul Gandhi don’t indulge in politics in this… My son fought in the army and will continue fighting in the army,” he said, in a video tweeted by news agency ANI.Rahul Gandhi has been attacking the government over the face-off between the Indian and Chinese soldiers in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed.“It’s now crystal clear that: 1. The Chinese attack in Galwan was pre-planned; 2. GOI was fast asleep and denied the problem; 3. The price was paid by our martyred Jawans,” Gandhi said on Twitter on Friday.The Congress leader also attached a news report about Union minister Shripad Naik saying that the June 15 attack was “pre-planned by China”. Congress president Sonia Gandhi had also asked if there was an intelligence failure on the build-up along the line of actual control (LAC) and sought an assurance from the government that status quo ante will be restored at LAC and China will revert to its original position.She also raised several questions about the situation along the LAC at an all-party meeting called by the Prime Minister to discuss the border stand-off with China.Indian and Chinese soldiers engaged in their first deadly conflict in at least 45 years at Patrol Point 14 in Galwan Valley, resulting in 20 deaths on the Indian side, including that of a commanding officer during the nearly seven-hour clash that also involved hand-to-hand fighting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rise-above-petty-politics-amit-shah-hits-back-after-rahul-gandhi-s-ladakh-remark/story-3zGP1eRdb5w7DaFp12EjyI.html

The programme aims to ban the open grazing of stray cattle after the sowing season is over,” said an Indian Administrative Service (IAS) official. A press release, issued on Friday, stated that the state government is aware that many villages in the state do not have cowsheds and cattle owners are likely to face major difficulties because of the ban on grazing to save Kharif crops.The government has come to the cattle owners’ rescue and is building 5,000 cowsheds across the state under the Suraaji Gaon Yojana. While 2,200 cowsheds have already been constructed, the work is in progress for another 2,800.The government has appealed to all sarpanches to ensure cattle remain in cowsheds when the ban on open grazing is in force, the release added.“An order has been issued, which states that if any cattle are found to be loitering in any civic area, then the municipal commissioner/chief municipal officer will be held responsible,” said a state government official.‘Roka-Chheka’ also aims to use organic manure by collecting cow dung from cowsheds.“The state government is creating new employment opportunities by building these cowsheds. Women self-help groups (SHGs) have been included in this programme. Members of SHGs will make goods and artifacts using cow dung, which can fetch them an additional profit. Diyas, or lamps, incense sticks made by women SHGs using cow dung were well received and did brisk business during the Diwali season in Delhi last year,” the release stated.The government also said that it has generated employment for around 25 lakh villagers under the Mahatma Gandhi National Employment Rural Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) amid the coronavirus disease (Covid-19)-induced nationwide lockdown restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-govt-launches-roka-chheka-abhiyan-to-save-kharif-crops-from-open-grazing/story-l8qNGbAYAovOtGWXigKxHP.html

The patrolling party of the BSF found the drone flying in the Rathua area of Hiranagar sector in Kathua, Jammu And Kashmir and shot it down. The drone fell into a field. “The Pakistani drone was flying inside Indian territory in Rathua area in Hiranagar sector around 5.10 am when a BSF patrol shot it down,“ said a police officer at Kathua police control room.Inspector General, BSF Jammu Frontier NS Jamwal said, “The BSF has shot down a drone from Pakistan near Kathua and recovered among others M-4 US-made semi-automatic rifle, 60 rounds in it, two magazines and seven M67 grenades”.Also read: Chinese action in Galwan Valley unacceptable: IAF chief Bhadauria“It is a big development because the Pakistanis have adopted similar modus operandi of what they have been doing in Punjab,” he added.The six copter drone itself weighed around 17.5 kilograms and the consignment weighed around five to six kilograms, said Jamwal. “Surely, it was an attempt to deliver the arms and ammunition to someone here on this side. Who was he, remains a matter of investigation,” he said. The BSF IGP informed that the drone had a winch mechanism with which entire consignment had to be dropped to this side and it had to fly back to Pakistan. “This delivery was for some ‘Ali Bhai’ as the payload was carrying his name,” he said.Also read: No intrusion in our territory, army has free hand, says PMA senior police official said that the drone was 8 feet in wide blade-to-blade and seems to have been controlled by Pak picket opposite Panesar Post of BSF in Hiranagar sector. “Same weapons were recovered from Jaish-e-Mohammad militants who were killed after infiltration from Pakistan in an encounter at Ban toll plaza Nagrota while they were travelling in a truck to Kashmir some months back,” the official said.Pak rangers and Pakistani Army use such drones to see deployment of Indian forces and gaps to push terrorists into India. Hiranagar sector has always remained an infiltration route for Pakistani terrorists because of its terrain and three to four seasonal rivulets that flow into Pakistan. The development comes close on the heels of the Galwan Valley intrusion by Chinese troops where India lost 20 of its soldiers on June 15 that included commanding officer of Bihar Regiment, Colonel Santosh Babu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pakistani-drone-shot-down-by-bsf-along-international-border-in-jammu-and-kashmir-s-kathua/story-mNqGxQJQh8RZ6wvgeXksnM.html
20-06-2020||India||Fossils of stegodon elephant found in Saharanpur’s Shivalik range||A joint team of forest officials and wildlife organisation World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) has claimed to have discovered fossil of a stegodon — a now-extinct elephant species known as Proboscideans — believed to be 5 to 8 million years old from Badshahi Bagh area of Shivalik range in Saharanpur district. The team, led by chief conservator of Saharanpur division VK Jain, was busy doing a trap camera survey for the counting of animals in the region recently when it came across the fossil. The team consisted of Jain, landscape coordinator, WWF, Dr IP Bopanna and senior programme officer Devvrat Panwar. Jain said after discovering a ‘strange object’ that looked like fossil, the team brought it to the forest office and decided to seek help of fossil experts. Dr RK Sehgal, a scientist at Wadia Institute of Himalayan Geology, Dehradun, and its retired scientist Dr AC Nanda, both fossil experts, first examined it and then compared it with the specimens of stegodon displayed at the museum of the institute. They declared that the fossil could be 5 to 8 million years old. The presence of stegodons shows the existence of dense forests and lots of river channels in the area during that time. Other fossils which existed with stegodons’ were of those of giraffe, horses and hippopotamus.The discovered fossil was a moderately preserved third lower molar with nine well-developed ridges on its surface. The length of the molar is nearly 24 centimetre and the enamel of the molar is very thick. The sandstone embedded on the fossil is medium grained, salt and pepper in nature. This type of lithology is the characteristic of Middle Shivalik. Describing it as a great discovery, divisional commissioner, Saharanpur, Sanjay Kumar said, “It would pave the way for further study of fossils in the country, especially in Shivalik range because for the first time such an old fossil has been found here.”It the past, fossils of Stegodon had also been discovered from other locations of Shivalik groups like Kala Amb, Saketi, in Himachal Pradesh; Jammu foothills and Chandigarh. The existence of stegodons was also found in the foothills of Nepal and Pakistan. Stegodons existed 11.6 million years ago. There are unconfirmed records of their regional survival until 4,100 years ago. Fossils are found in Asian and African strata dating from the late Miocene. During the Pleistocene, they lived across large parts of Asia and Central Africa.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fossils-of-stegodon-elephant-found-in-saharanpur-s-shivalik-range/story-a3YDohUmJqvcm5myrOZrwN.html

The gallant actions in a highly-challenging situation have demonstrated our resolve to protect India’s sovereignty at any cost,” Bhadauria said.Colonel Babu was the commander of the 16th Bihar regiment, who was killed along with 19 other men Galwan valley in Eastern Ladakh on Monday night.“It should be very clear that we are well prepared and suitably deployed to respond to any contingency. I assure the nation that we are determined to deliver and will never let the sacrifice of the braves of Galwan go in vain,” the IAF chief added.He made the comments during the Combined Graduation Parade (CGP) at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad.“The security scenario in our region mandates that our armed forces remain prepared and vigilant at all times. The development at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in Ladakh is a small snapshot of what we are required to handle at short notice,” he said.“In spite of unacceptable Chinese action after agreements reached during military talks and resulting loss of lives, all efforts are underway to ensure that the current situation at LAC is resolved peacefully,” Bhadauria said.China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) killed 20 personnel of the Indian Army, including a Colonel, on June 15 in the Galwan Valley after the PLA did not follow through on a commitment to disengage as per an understanding reached between the two militaries on June 6. Indian military officials familiar with the sequence of the clash believe there were over 40 casualties on the Chinese side, including deaths and injuries. China has not officially given out numbers of casualties on its side.Tensions between India and China have increased after the June 15 Galwan skirmish that marked the first Indian casualties in a border clash with PLA troops since October 1975 when Chinese troops ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said on Friday that neither has anyone entered Indian territory, nor is anyone present in Indian territory currently, and nor is any Indian post captured.“Neither has anyone entered our territory, nor is anyone still there, nor is any of our posts under anyone’s capture. In Ladakh, our 20 jawans got martyred. But they taught a lesson to those who were eyeing Indian territory,” PM Modi said at an all-party meeting called to discuss the India-China border situation.The PM had also praised the valour of the 20 army personnel killed in the clash and said they “taught a lesson” to those who were eyeing Indian territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-action-in-galwan-valley-unacceptable-efforts-underway-to-ensure-peaceful-resolution-iaf-chief-bhadauria/story-tU4LWyjrORnzXLXFEvZUjL.html

20-06-2020||India||Google, WhatsApp help reunite woman in her 90s with family after 43 years||Panchubai lived as Achchhan for more than four decades with the Khan family until she was reunited with her grandson this week.Israr Khan, with whom Panchubai lived all these years, and the residents of Kota Tala village in Damoh district came to know their Achchhan Mausi (aunt) was from Maharashtra just last month. Prithvi Kumar Shinde took his grandmother, who is in her early 90s, home on Thursday to Nagpur in Maharashtra. Khan could find her grandson with a little help from Google and WhatsApp. No one knows how Panchubai covered the distance of about 500km from a village in Amravati district in Maharashtra to Damoh in the Bundelkhand region. She was spotted by Khan’s father, a truck driver, on a road after she was attacked by a swarm of bees.“My father late Noor Khan saw her in pain while he was on his way home as many as 43 years back. He gave her some herbs for relief from the pain caused by stinging of bees,” Khan said. His father saw her again on the roadside a few days later and asked her about her whereabouts but she couldn’t say anything. He then brought her home. “Since then she became our Achchhan Mausi and that of the entire village, a name given by my father,” Khan, who works with a social organisation, said.“She used to utter Marathi words most often. My father and later myself and my friends tried hard to find her village but our efforts always hit a roadblock as we couldn’t get any clue from her or perhaps we failed to understand what she said,” he added.On May 4, during the lockdown, the Khan family was sitting together when she said something. Khan recorded what she said on his mobile phone and figured out that she mentioned Khanjam Nagar. “Later, I found a Khanjam Nagar panchayat in Amravati district. Through the help of Google, I could get the mobile phone number of a kiosk owner Abhishek in Khanjam Nagar. I had a talk with him and sought his help to circulate the photo of Mausi through WhatsApp in his village and around,” Khan said. “We jumped in joy when Abhishek told me that a family in the village identified Mausi as Panchubai and that she happened to be the grandmother of Prithvi Kumar Shinde who, however, resides in Nagpur with his family now,” he added.Shinde then contacted Khan. He told them that Panchubai lost her husband Tejpal in 2005 and son Bhailal three years ago.“My grandfather Tejpal and father Bhailal lost hopes of finding her having made frantic search several times. My grandfather had lodged a missing report too with the police station,” Shinde said.“I am happy that I am taking my grandmother home but sad too that my grandfather and father both passed away without seeing her and that she spent 40 years without us,” he added.Shinde said is thankful to the Khan family for taking care of his grandmother for 43 years.“However, I will always remain indebted to late Noor Khan and his son Israr Khan as this family not only gave shelter to my grandmother but also took care of her as its own member. If I am able to see my grandmother it’s because of Noor Khan and Israr Khan,” he added.Khan and his family couldn’t hold their tears when Panchubai left.“Since my childhood, I have been seeing Achchhan Mausi as my guardian. I have a mixed feeling. I am happy that she has ultimately got her family back but I am sad that I am losing our guardian.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-help-of-google-and-whatsapp-a-woman-in-her-90-s-reunited-with-family-after-43-years/story-PxipCJbS8yQTs5CRfjKtrN.html

They are not being able to draw pensions form banks on the Indian side in Uttarakhand since March due to the sealing of the border between the two countries, said an ex-serviceman.Several veteran ex-servicemen of Nepal who worked in the Indian Army, are living in the border areas of western Nepal. They draw their pension from Indian banks situated in Banbasa area of Champawat, Jhulaghat and Dharchula areas of Pithoragarh and Khatima area of US Nagar district in Uttarakhand.“These are the Nepalese citizens who joined the Indian Army previously through a certain quota for the Nepalese and are now living in border areas of Nepal. They still draw a pension from different Indian banks situated on this side of the border,” said Capt Bhani Chand (Retd), president, Gaurav Sainani Kalyan Samiti, Banbasa, Champawat.Also read: No intrusion in our territory, army has free hand, says PMThe Nepalese used to be recruited in the army under the Indo-Nepal treaty. They worked in the Indian Army and later returned to their native places after retirement. Several of them have been settled in Dehradun, Almora, Pithoragarh and different parts of Uttarakhand also.“Nepalese ex-servicemen are facing this problem along the Uttar Pradesh and Bihar border also. Nepalese ex-servicemen requested us to raise their problem so we are sending a memorandum to defence ministry of India,” said Capt Chand.“Around 700 Nepalese pensioners draw pension every month from our branch. Their pension is pending due to the sealing of India-Nepal border,” said Kamlesh Joshi, branch manager, state bank of India, Jhulaghat.The Nepalese are recruited in the army as per the Indo-Nepal treaty-1950. According to its provisions, the Nepal government allows its citizens to serve Indian Armed Forces and in return, India allows Nepalese to work anywhere in India in the private sector or government services (except for Indian administrative services).Pramod Bhatt, a businessman from Jhulaghat, said, “I have been watching Nepalese pensioners coming for their pension and purchasing household materials since childhood. They are not coming for the last three months due to the sealing of the international border.”Notably, international border is sealed since March due to Covid-19 outbreak. Entry points along the border were opened but only for migrants of both sides. No other person was allowed to cross the border during the lockdown, said officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nepalese-pensioners-who-retired-from-indian-army-facing-financial-crunch-due-to-sealing-of-border/story-mpAaJyEJYb1y9E1Wvt9jyI.html

However, he said the country is hurt and angry by what Chinese forces have done.Before Modi's remarks, Gandhi raised several questions about the situation along the LAC. “In fact, even at this late stage, we are still in the dark about many crucial aspects of the crisis,” she said.The meeting was attended by leaders of 20 political parties. Apart from Gandhi, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief Sharad Pawar; Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee; Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) leader K Chandrasekhar Rao; Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar; Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader MK Stalin;YSR Congress Party president YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and Shiv Sena chief Uddhav Thackeray were among those who attended the meeting.Defence minister Rajnath Singh and external affairs minister S Jaishankar were also present.While the Congress has repeatedly urged the government to be transparent about the border situation, Modi had earlier asserted that the sacrifice of Indian soldiers will not go in vain.“It’s now crystal clear that -- the Chinese attack in Galwan was pre-planned, the Government of India was fast asleep and denied the problem and the price was paid by our martyred Jawans (soldiers),” former Congress president Rahul Gandhi tweeted earlier in the day.He also tagged a report quoting minister of state for defence Shripad Naik, saying the attack was pre-planned by China and Indian forces will give a befitting reply.“We have some specific questions, for the government. On which date did the Chinese troops intrude into our territory in Ladakh? When did the government find out about the Chinese transgressions into our territory? Was it on May 5th, as reported, or earlier?” said Sonia Gandhi at the all-party meeting.“Does the government not receive, on a regular basis, satellite pictures of the borders of our country? Did our external intelligence agencies not report any unusual activity along the LAC? Did the military intelligence not alert the government about the intrusion and build-up of forces along the LAC, whether on the Chinese side or on the Indian side? In the government’s considered view, was there a failure of intelligence,” she further asked.It was for the first time since 1975 that India suffered combat fatalities in an incident involving Chinese troops during Monday night’s seven-hour clash in Galwan Valley. Also, 10 Indian soldiers detained by the Chinese were released after intense negotiations through diplomatic and military channels. China has so far not acknowledged any casualties among its troops.“The question is, what next? What is the way forward? The country would like an assurance that status quo ante would be restored and China will revert back to the original position on LAC,” the Congress chief said. The Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) and the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) reacted strongly for not being invited to the meeting.According to a government functionary, the criteria followed for sending invites to parties was -- all recognised national parties, those with over five MPs in the Lok Sabha, leading parties from the Northeast and parties with Union cabinet ministers.The Congress president said the all-party meeting should have come sooner and immediately after the government was reportedly informed about the Chinese intrusion on May 5, 2020 into several places in Ladakh .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/did-intelligence-failure-lead-to-lac-build-up-asks-sonia/story-4uuEMB4P9fwQCdnuSgSBaL.html

The guidelines continue to be effective, as on date, read a statement.As per the Ministry guidelines, very mild and pre-symptomatic Covid-19 patients can opt for home isolation provided the patient has a room to himself/herself with toilet facility and has an adult attendant /caregiver. Also, the patient shall agree to monitor his health and regularly inform the health status to the District Surveillance Officer for further follow up by the surveillance teams.“An important clause of the Revised Guidelines is that the treating doctor is satisfied about the patient opting for home isolation based on medical assessment and assessment of his/her residential accommodation. In addition, the patient shall fill in an undertaking on self-isolation and shall follow home quarantine guidelines,” the statement read.Also, all such cases of home isolation further shall be monitored by teams of well-oriented doctors on a regular basis, their discharge should follow the required guidelines and shall be reported as per norms.In this regard, the statement said that some instances have been noticed wherein home isolation is allowed in a routine manner in certain States, and clauses of the revised guidelines are not followed in letter and spirit.“This may lead to spread of the disease within the family members and neighbours, more so in urban settings such as dense urban agglomerations,” the statement read.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-centre-asks-states-to-follow-guidelines-for-effective-home-isolation/story-Jeo4smFdolaaLsOXdWddZL.html

The case was adjourned for July 7 after the central government requested additional time to file its response.The Supreme Court had earlier refused to stay the project when the matter had come up for hearing on April 30.The Central Vista houses iconic buildings like the Parliament House, Rashtrapati Bhavan, the North and South Block buildings, which house important ministries, and the India Gate. The government is proposing to redevelop the Central Vista by constructing a new Parliament house, a residential complex that will house the Prime Minister and the Vice President, besides several new office buildings.The petitioners, advocate Rajeev Suri and retired Lt. Colonel Anuj Srivastava sought a direction from the court that no further work should take place on the ground (construction work) in furtherance of the project even if approvals are granted. The bench declined to grant such relief.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-refuses-to-stay-central-vista-redevelopment-project-again/story-mbJ0svU2pCflMhA6P9Ov1I.html
20-06-2020||India||Two brothers kill their kids, die by suicide in Gujarat||Two brothers from Ahmedabad city allegedly ended their lives after killing their four minor children, police said. All the six people were found hanging in a flat in a middle-class society in the city on Friday.Police said they were investigating whether the men took the step because of financial stress as a notice from bank to pay back loan amount was found pasted on a wall in the flat.“Preliminary probe reveals that the two brothers worked in different garment shops. On June 17, they left their respective homes after telling their wives that they were taking their kids for an outing. One of the brothers reached the unoccupied flat, where they used to live in the past, in a car along with his two children around 8.40 pm while the other brother reached around 10 pm on a scooter with his two children,” said Nipuna M Torawane, a joint commissioner of police (JCP) in Ahmedabad city. The flat belonged to the younger brother where both the men lived together with their families. However, they had shifted to separate houses six months ago. A half torn notice from a bank to pay the dues was found pasted outside the flat. The amount is yet to be verified,” the JCP said.When the police official was asked whether the deceased had killed themselves due to financial stress or if they were under the influence of black magic, as similar incidents had been reported in the past too, she said, “Different teams have been formed which are investigating the case from different angles. We are not ruling out any possibility. We are tracking their past, recording statements of their relatives and friends to reach a conclusion.”No suicide note has been recovered so far. The police official said when the two brother didn’t reach their respective homes for two days, their wives went to the flat which was found locked from inside. “When they found the house locked from inside, they informed the neighbours, local police and around 3am, the door was broken and the six were found hanging inside,” Torawane said.The police found the bodies of the two men in the drawing room, two girls in the kitchen and two 12-year-old boys in another bedroom. “The bodies must be over a day old as they had started decaying. We are yet to find the exact cause of death but four plastic tumblers have been recovered from the flat which indicates that the two brothers had given some drink to the kids...it could have been laced with sedatives...,” said Torawane.If you need support or know someone who does, please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist.

They then agreed to register it in her son’s name but objected to her entry into their house. “However this week, the panchayat passed a diktat banning my entry into the village for the next 15 years. It has asked me to live at my parental home along with my son and daughter and allowed to rejoin my in-laws only after my son turns 18,” she said.Stating that the panchayat had done injustice with her, Devi added, “It is very difficult for me to live at my parental home for so long.”Sarpanch Sadhu Ram, when contacted, said the panchayat did pass an order to such effect.“We had called a panchayat after Devi and her in-laws were constantly engaging in domestic fights. Initially, the in-laws were accusing Devi of her husband’s death but later accepted their mistake. We have asked Devi to return to her in-laws’ house when her son attains the age of 18 years,” Ram said.Bhuna block development and panchayat officer Mahender Singh said the panchayat has done injustice to the widow and the sarpanch did not have any right to pass such a diktat.“We can take action only against the sarpanch. Rest of the investigation will be done by the police if the woman files an official complaint,” Singh added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-village-panchayat-bans-entry-of-a-widow-for-15-years/story-vjCUFvSx9oGtmMj6LgV5SO.html

20-06-2020||India||India seeks to contain Chinese influence in UN||India will place efforts to contain Chinese attempts to expand its influence in the United Nations system as a foreign policy priority. New Delhi has always sought to reduce Beijing’s influence in the UN and its affiliated organisations, but it is now considering “all options” in its responses. Even the UN Human Rights Council, a tainted body that India has generally kept at arm’s length, may not be off the list.Previously indifferent to East River, over the past decade, China has come to see the UN as a means to legitimize its status as a great power. Its footprint has also grown because of United States hostility to the organisation. There at least four areas India will direct its diplomatic firepower.One will be to deny China chairmanship of UN agencies. Beijing holds four chairs presently and wants more such positions. India will, at the least, seek to ensure China does not win more positions and preferably lose some of the ones it already holds. The Chinese heads of the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the International Telecommunications Union are already in their second terms and seen as vulnerable. Indian officials say China sees four chairs as the absolute minimum it should have.A second line is to ensure no major UN offices or agencies are set up in China. Beijing has long been unhappy that no UN agency is based in their country despite being the world’s number two power. The present UN secretary-general, Antonio Guterres, has been trying to set up regional UN offices because of the high cost of operations in New York City. Last year, Beijing lobbied to have one such office set up in Shanghai. Besides land and housing, it even offered to pay part of the salaries of the UN staff. When China tried to mobilize the 140-strong Group of 77 countries to win support for the idea, India mobilized friendly governments from Africa to stall the plans. The US joined in at the Security Council level, citing security concerns about having UN offices on Chinese soil. While this drive has been derailed, Beijing will try again. “It’s still on the agenda,” says a former Indian UN diplomat.China also wants to take the helm in UN peace-keeping efforts. Beijing now contributes more to the peacekeeping fund than Britain, France and Russia combined. India has noted China is already pushing its soldiers to countries where its firms have economic interests. Chinese soldiers have performed miserably in South Sudan, but Beijing is more interested in giving the orders from the top.Finally, Beijing chafes at the fact it receives very few of the UN’s lucrative billion-dollar contracts for services and equipment. India, for example, is the second largest UN contractor thanks to its pharmaceutical products.China, say UN officials, “is nowhere on the list.” There is an expectation Beijing will try to get the rules of the UN’s tendering process diluted to its advantage||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-seeks-to-contain-chinese-influence-in-un/story-sESzYEDpYK11MYOeIxslRM.html
20-06-2020||India||100 days of Covid-19: Forced to travel in the middle of a pandemic||Why travel when you can be home and safe? Ask the thousands of people who couldn’t think of anything else through India’s four lockdowns beginning March 25. Covid-19 has killed the idea of travelling for fun, but fun is not the only reason people travel. Sometimes, their lives depends on it — or work or relationships or refuge. That isn’t going to change, virus or no virus. Ashwini Chennuri needed to travel from Hyderabad to Visakhapatnam to be operated on; Shashank Tiwari from Mumbai to Hyderabad to be with his girlfriend; Geeta Patel from Chennai to Charlottesville because she wanted to be home; and Manmasih Banjo from Kottayam to Chaibasa because he was forced to go home after he lost the job. But how does one travel between cities, states and countries if buses, trains and flights won’t run? From March 25 to May 3, India barred buses and trains from running except to carry essential supplies; flights, domestic and international, too remained grounded until May. Ashwini Chennuri hitched a ride with a mango truck. On April 25, Chennuri, a Hyderabad resident who works for a short-video app, felt a sharp pain in his lower stomach. “I had been suffering from pancreatitis,” he said. “The doctor told me to get an operation. I could have gone to a hospital in the city but I couldn’t afford the charges.” “A shopkeeper told me that if I wanted, I could sit in the truck his cousin was due to drive from Hyderabad to Visakhapatnam carrying mangoes.” So, Chennuri travelled 500 km sitting beside mangoes, and dropped off across the state border in time for his operation. “I was fit to drive back after a day of bed rest, but I didn’t have the permission. You could only apply for a border pass if you were transporting something,” he said.This time, Chennuri walked up to the highway and waited for a lift. “I was in some pain, but I didn’t have an option.” After some time, a cattle truck rolled by. “I asked the driver how much he would charge to ferry me, and he quoted Rs 2000. I climbed in.” The cows were noisy, but Chennuri sat glued to his spot for the next 12 hours. “I had to get out of the truck at all the four checkpoints and walk for a bit until the truck caught up with me. If I hadn’t, I would have been sent to a quarantine facility by the border police.” A month later, Shashank Tiwari stood with his suitcase on a road in Goregaon, Mumbai, waiting under a drizzle for a vehicle, any vehicle, that would take him to the airport. On May 24, as India was under lockdown 4, air travel reopened, and Tiwari, who works for a radio station, booked one of the first flights out. “The number of cases in Mumbai were multiplying and I was worried about falling sick. Also, I wanted to be with my girlfriend who lives in Hyderabad,” he said. It wasn’t an easy decision, however. “At every step after I left the house, I felt I was fighting a battle. Sitting in the auto rickshaw to the airport, I worried about the number of people who must have sat in it before me,” he said. He hadn’t yet anticipated what awaited him at the airport.“At the entry, a guard examined my ID card and the Arogya Setu [tracking] app from behind a glass pane. Every part of the process was free of [human] contact. I printed my boarding pass and luggage tag, tied the tag around the luggage handle, and checked it in myself. It was all fine except that I had totally forgotten about a scheduled office conference call on zoom. My phone rang just as I was placing my bag on the luggage belt. I had to join the call,” said Tiwari who has been working from home since the first lockdown. So, he proceeded towards the security area holding his mobile phone in front of his face and his colleagues’ voices booming out from the speakers. “At the security, too, you have to do everything yourself. You don’t realise how long everything takes if you are wearing gloves. Even taking out the wallet from my back pocket took forever, and I could only use one hand, because the other was still holding the mobile phone on which the zoom call was in progress. I just hoped no one would ask me a question.” At the boarding gate, Tiwari was handed over a kit straight out of sci-fi. “It had a face mask, a face shield, and for those booked in middle seats, like myself, a white gown so large that five of me could fit into it. The shield comes down to your chin, and as you keep breathing through the mask, the space in front of your face fogs up. I couldn’t see properly with the shield on, and with the gown falling beyond my shoes, I couldn’t walk properly, either,” he said. Once out of the plane, Tiwari left the airport as fast as he could. “I wonder how long we can we can fly like this!” he said.Stuck in Chennai, a city she was visiting when the first lockdown kicked in, Geeta Patel spent a few seconds every day staring at flying planes. “I felt like a little child,” said Patel, currently a professor at the University of Virginia who had come to India in January on a Fullbright-Nehru research fellowship. On March 10, Patel, an American citizen and an OCI card holder, flew to Chennai from Delhi for research. In a week, she was supposed to return, and proceed to Boston for a conference. “But then Janta Curfew happened, and I thought it best to postpone my flight,” she said. In April, when the US ran repatriation flights, the pandemic was spreading fast and Patel didn’t want to take a risk flying. “On those flights, they weren’t giving out masks or ordering social distancing. If I got on, I would end up very very sick,” she said. In early May, the American embassy in India alerted her to a new series of repatriation flights, and Patel entered a paperwork spiral that she describes as “Kafka on Covid.” “On every new page, you are asked a lot of questions that you don’t know how to answer,” she said. After days of phone calls with the airline customer care, Patel got a seat on a flight leaving Bengaluru for New York via Paris. To board the flight, she needed to fill out more forms. The information demanded of her was obscure. “The names of the mother and father of the driver who would take me from Chennai to the Bengaluru airport, the relevant taluka and police station for every check point we would encounter, the registration number for my mother’s house in Noida,” she said. She almost gave up while filling out an excel sheet as part of securing border permissions (to pass every checkpoint in Tamil Nadu until its border with Karnataka; to cross over; to enter the airport; and get on the plane) that took 18 hours to complete. She realised her form kept getting rejected because she had a left a full stop where it didn’t belong. On May 20, Patel boarded the plane to Paris. A connecting flight to New York and two domestic flights later, she posted a Facebook update beginning with two magical words: “Finally home.” For many travellers in the coming months, home won’t be the last stop. After a three-day train ride from Kottayam in Kerala to Jasidih in Jharkhand, Manmasih Banjo has to spend another 10 days at a quarantine facility before he can go home to Chaibasa. Just a month after Banjo arrived in Kottayam to start working at a furniture factory, the first lockdown was announced and his workplace closed up. Stuck in a village over 2000 km from home. “Trains weren’t going out of Kerala. Some groups of migrant workers were able to book private buses, but it cost a lot of money,” he said. In the weeks after the first lockdown, thousands of migrant workers started for their homes on foot, but his home being thousands of kilometers away, Banjo waited. On 1 May, reacting to the struggles of migrant workers of whom many had died on their journeys, the Indian Railways initiated a series of special trains to take them home. Banjo registered for a seat. “I went to the local police office and filled out a form meant for migrant workers from Jharkhand. Nearly a month passed before I got a message saying a train was available. We went to the village office, paid Rs 900 and booked a trip. They gave us a receipt and asked us to go the village hospital for a medical checkup. After the checkup, the hospital gave us a token each that we needed to show to board a bus that took us to the railway station. At the station, we were given mask, sanitiser, food and water, and told to board the train while keeping our distance from each other,” he said. When Banjo finally reaches home, he would like to find work nearby. If that doesn’t work out, he would leave to earn a living again. The next time, though, he said, he won’t be sharing a berth with another man.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-days-of-covid-19-forced-to-travel-in-the-middle-of-a-pandemic/story-JGJgWQm8xp8hF2K3f5R7lN.html
20-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||I don’t know whether you received that WhatsApp forward about the time traveller who lands up in 2020.“Which year is this?” she asks someone.“2020.”“Ah, the first year of the quarantine.”If time travel were really possible — like pandemics, they are a recurring theme in dystopian fiction; some even successfully combine both — and if a traveller from the future were to arrive in 2020, it may help us answer questions about the coronavirus disease that we are still wrestling with.They could be really basic: like, do we find a cure? Or, how long does this last?Or, they could be morbid: like, how many people die?Or, they could be scientific. For instance, does being infected give one immunity? And if so, for how long?It turns out, according to a study published on Thursday in the journal Nature Medicine, that asymptomatic people may produce antibodies that can fight the viral disease for just a few months. The study is based on a small group, but its finding is worrying because it suggests that unlike a few other diseases, where being infected once gives a person lifelong immunity (chicken pox is an example), contracting the coronavirus disease once doesn’t mean a person will not contract it again. To be sure, it also does not mean that they will contract it again — even a trace presence of antibodies may be enough to fight off the disease, and the immune systems of these asymptomatic people might be better primed to face the Sars-CoV2 virus for the second time.So what does it mean? In the words of the authors, this might have “implications for immunity strategy and serological surveys”.Their reference is to the thinking in many countries that widely administered antibody tests can be used to identify who is immune and who isn’t, with the former being allowed to return to work, or travel. Now it emerges — caveat: this study is based on a very small sample — that some asymptomatic infected people might not test for these antibodies (and that they may or may not be immune).With so-called immunity passports being ruled out — for both ethical reasons and scientific ones — everything on the discovery and availability of a vaccine for the coronavirus disease. There are many promising candidates in various stages of testing and trial, and we could have a vaccine by next year. But it won’t be widely available immediately. The world will need seven billion doses (and if it is similar to flu shots, we may have to take one every year) and not everyone will get it. Issues related to ownership, funding, distribution, and prioritisation will need to be worked out. But according to a recent Bloomberg article, there could be a bigger problem with the first vaccines: they may not prevent the coronavirus disease.Citing Robin Shattock, a professor at Imperial College London — apart from its models that have informed debates on the spread of the pandemic, the institution is also working on a vaccine — the article said that researchers may settle for vaccines that prevent severe disease instead of looking for the perfect one that offers protection from the infection.“Is that protection against infection?” Shattock said. “Is it protection against illness? Is it protection against severe disease? It’s quite possible a vaccine that only protects against severe disease would be very useful,” he was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.So, antibody tests can’t really tell if someone is immune and the first vaccines will only offer protection from severe disease, not infection.Clearly, this is one difficult virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-NuDekdyvSdzlMh1eFNY8xJ.html
20-06-2020||India||NDA gains Rajya Sabha ground, BJP bags 11 of 24 seats||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) gained crucial ground in the Rajya Sabha on Friday, winning eight of the 19 seats across eight states that went to polls in the first major electoral exercise since the outbreak of Covid-19. The party has earlier won three seats unopposed.Former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia of the BJP, Congress leader Digvijaya Singh and former Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren were among the heavyweights who emerged victorious on Friday even as high drama unfolded in Gujarat and Manipur, where the counting of votes began late amidst allegations of irregularities.Also read: 1,000 leaders clad in safety gear cast votes for Rajya Sabha seatsThe BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA), which had 90 members in the Rajya Sabha, has taken its tally to 101 in the 245-member Upper House, where the majority mark is 123. This is for the first time that the NDA tally in the Upper House has breached 100. The BJP alone will have 86 seats. The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) will have 65 seats.The NDA, if backed by parties such as the Biju Janata Dal (BJD), All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) and the YSR Congress Party (YSRCP), can breach the halfway mark in the Upper House, and will be in a position to push key legislations in Parliament. It has an overwhelming majority in the Lok Sabha. Elections to 24 seats in 10 states were initially scheduled for March 26, but they were deferred as India clamped a lockdown to stop the spread of the disease around that time. From the original list, four candidates in Karnataka, including former prime minister HD Devegowda, and one in Arunachal Pradesh were elected unopposed. Polling was held in the remaining seats on Friday. Altogether, the BJP won 11 of the 24 seats.Personal protective equipment (PPE) and hand sanitizer were in supply in polling booths on Friday, and social distancing norms followed with nearly 1,000 legislators taking part in the polling process in the shadow of the pandemic.In Gujarat, the ruling BJP won three seats (Narhari Amin, Abhay Bharadwaj and Ramilaben Bara) and the Congress one (Shaktisinh Gohil). The resignation of eight MLAs since March denied the Congress a chance to bag the second seat. The declaration of the result was delayed after the Congress demanded that the Election Commission (EC) invalidate two BJP votes on different grounds. The Congress objected to Bhupendrasinh Chudasama casting his vote on the ground that his election was annulled by the Gujarat high court in May. The Supreme Court has stayed that order. The party also red-flagged Kesrisinh Solanki’s vote, saying an unauthorised person accompanied him inside the booth.A senior official, however, said the EC observer rejected the Congress’s objections and referred the matter to the poll watchdog’s Delhi office for final decision.In Manipur, the lone Rajya Sabha seat went to poll in the backdrop of an ongoing power tussle between the ruling BJP and the Congress. Fifty-two of the 59 members of the legislative assembly exercised their franchise with the BJP’s Sanajaoba Leishemba, the titular king of Manipur, securing 28 votes to defeat the Congress’s T Mangibabu, who got 24 votes. Though polling in the north-eastern state ended at 4pm, the counting of votes began around 8:30pm. The delay was attributed to the Congress’s complaints about irregularities during the voting process.In other states, results were along the expected lines with the ruling Congress foiling the BJP’s bid to such snatch an extra seat in Rajasthan. In the desert state, KC Venugopal and Neeraj Dangi of the Congress were declared winners. So was Rajendra Gehlot of the BJP. Also read: JMM’s Shibu Soren and BJP’s Deepak Prakash win Rajya Sabha polls from JharkhandThe BJP fielded a second candidate, but he lost. Congress insiders praised deputy chief minister Sachin Pilot for winning two seats in the face of the BJP onslaught.Scindia, who joined the BJP in March, sailed through in Madhya Pradesh and will make his debut in the Upper House. His party colleague, Sumer Singh Solanki, too registered a win. Congress veteran Digvijaya Singh retained his seat. In Jharkhand, former chief minister Soren and the BJP’s Deepak Prakash won the two seats. K Vanlalvena, a candidate of BJP ally Mizo National Front (MNF), bagged the lone seat in Mizoram, while the National People’s Party’s (NPP) WR Kharlukhi won in Meghalaya. The lone BJP MLA in Mizoram did not turn up to vote for ally MNF.In Andhra Pradesh, the ruling YSR Congress Party’s Pilli Subhash Chandra Bose, Mopidevi Venkata Ramana, Parimal Nathwani and Ayodhya Rami Reddy swept the four seats up for grabs.Altogether 61 seats in the Rajya Sabha were filled this year with 43 first-timers being elected and 12 members getting re-elected. Apart from Scindia, other prominent first-timers included Mallikarjun Kharge and KC Venugopal of the Congress, and M Thambidurai of the AIADMK, among others.After the vacancies arose in March across 20 states, 42 members were elected unopposed, including 28 first-timers. “While the 61 retiring members have a total experience of 95 terms ranging from one to four terms in the Rajya Sabha, the winners come with a total experience of only 32 terms, resulting in a decline in total experience of 63 terms,” a Rajya Sabha official said.Some of the 12 members who were re-elected included Bhubaneswar Kalita, a former Congress parliamentarian who switched sides to the BJP; Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar; and Union minister Ramdas Athawale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nda-gains-rs-ground-bjp-bags-11-of-24-seats/story-lGuALCtB4Z9wLT0qC11oFL.html
20-06-2020||India||No intrusion in our territory, army has free hand, says PM||In the wake of the killing of 20 Indian Army soldiers by China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley and amid reports of Chinese forces intruding across the Line of Actual Control (LAC), Prime Minister Narendra Modi categorically said on Friday that neither has anyone entered Indian territory, nor is anyone present in Indian territory currently, and nor is any Indian post captured.The PM also praised the valour of the 20 army personnel killed in the clash, and said they “taught a lesson” to those who were eyeing Indian territory.While highlighting the capability of India’s armed forces and suggesting they have been given a free hand, Modi said that with India upgrading its border infrastructure, its armed forces better equipped, and more frequent patrolling, India is able to better “monitor” developments at the LAC and “respond better”.“Neither has anyone entered our territory, nor is anyone still there, nor is any of our posts under anyone’s capture. In Ladakh, our 20 jawans got martyred. But they taught a lesson to those who were eyeing Indian territory,” he said at an all-party meeting called to discuss the India-China border situation.But the PM’s remarks led to some speculation about the exact status at the LAC, particularly the Galwan Valley, which China, in recent statements, has claimed is part of its sovereign territory. India has dismissed the Chinese claim of sovereignty over the Galwan valley.A ministry of external affairs (MEA) statement on Wednesday said the Chinese sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on the Indian side of the LAC and took “pre-meditated and planned action” that resulted in the violence and casualties on June 15. The statement further said the Chinese intended to change the status quo on the ground in violation of all bilateral agreements not to do so.China’s People’s Liberation Army (PLA) killed 20 personnel of the Indian Army, including a Colonel, on June 15 in the Galwan valley after the PLA did not follow through on a commitment to disengage as per an understanding reached between the two militaries on June 6. While China has not officially given out numbers of casualties on its side, Indian military officials familiar with the sequence of the clash believe there were over 40 casualties on the Chinese side, including deaths and injuries. This was the first incident of bloodshed on the India-China border since 1975 and has led to an escalation of the ongoing conflict at the border in eastern Ladakh.Friday’s all-party meeting to discuss the fallout of the incident was attended by defence minister Rajnath Singh, external affairs minister S Jaishankar, Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Trinamool Congress chief Mamata Banerjee, Bahujan Samaj Party chief Mayawati, Nationalist Congress Party chief Sharad Pawar, Telangana Rashtra Samithi leader K Chandrasekhar Rao, Janata Dal (United) chief Nitish Kumar, Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) leader MK Stalin, YSR Congress Party’s YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and Shiv Sena president Uddhav Thackeray .Even as all political parties expressed their solidarity with the government and the armed forces in the wake of the ongoing confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh, Congress president Sonia Gandhi questioned the government about a possible intelligence failure, suggested that the country had been kept in dark about developments, and demanded the restoration of status quo ante at the LAC.In his remarks at the end of the meeting, according to an official statement released by the Prime Minister’s Office, Modi said that the entire country was “hurt and angry” at China’s steps at the LAC, but emphasised that the armed forces were doing all that they needed to do protect the country. “Be it deployment, action or counter action, through land, sea or air, our forces are taking the necessary steps to protect the country... Indian forces are capable of moving together across sectors.” He said that while the army had been given the freedom to take necessary steps, India had also conveyed its position through diplomatic means.The PM also said that the government had given primacy to development of border area infrastructure; it had also provided fighter planes, modern helicopters, missile defence systems and other needs of the armed forces; and patrolling capacity at LAC had also increased. “We are better informed about the developments at LAC and consequently are able to monitor and respond better. The movement of those which used to take place without any disruption earlier is now checked by our jawans, which, at times, leads to build up of tension,” he said, according to the official statement.External affairs minister S Jaishankar made a presentation at the meeting, which conveyed the stance taken by the ministry and included a summation of the engagements through diplomatic and other channels with the Chinese side to de-escalate and to disengage, people familiar with development said. According to the official statement, he also gave an overview of agreements between India and China on border management, informed about the directions given by the PM in 2014 to accord highest priority to the development of infrastructure in border areas in the regions identified and approved by the government back in 1999.Commenting on the PM’s comments on the incursion, Commodre (retired) C Uday Bhaskar, director of the Society for Policy Studies, said: “PM Modi’s s statement that nobody has entered Indian territory may be ‘legally’ accurate but it is disingenuous. It is contrary to the MEA’s assertion about a premeditated attack by the PLA and will baffle a nation that is shocked and enraged at the manner in which 20 army personnel have lost their lives.”Bhaskar added that while the sensitivity of the LAC violence must be recognised, there was a “growing sense, accompanied with dismay” that the country was not being told the full truth about the Galwan setback.Two retired army officials, who asked not to be named, also expressed their surprise.A former army commander, who asked not to be named, said: “If the PLA has not breached the LAC and come into our areas, what is the dialogue at the military and diplomatic level for? The people of the country must be made aware of the reality along the border.”A second retired officer said on condition of anonymity that China was trying to change status quo along the border. “We have to assert our claims forcefully. Many soldiers have died guarding these frontiers. We must never forget that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-intrusion-in-our-territory-army-has-free-hand-says-pm/story-vnD4uvqlLkL3E9I46Sg2cJ.html
20-06-2020||India||1,000 leaders clad in safety gear cast votes for Rajya Sabha seats||An Election Commission (EC) official first heard about the term personal protective equipment (PPE), the clothing, face shields, goggles, etc used for the prevention of infections, in March when it entered the popular lexicon amid the worsening Covid-19 pandemic. Even then, he thought it was solely for doctors and others involved in tacking the disease. Little did the official know that a few months later he would find himself in a PPE suit conducting a Rajya Sabha election in Madhya Pradesh on Friday. “For about 45 minutes, when the only Covid-19 positive legislator came to vote, all the polling officials were in PPE suits, like the MLA [member of legislative assembly],” the official said. “It took some of us nearly as long to put the suits on. ” The legislator was brought for voting in an ambulance that was sanitised multiple times. To further reduce the risk of transmission, all fans and coolers were switched off at the polling booth when he voted. PPE suits and ambulances were part of EC’s guidelines for conducting the elections to vacant Rajya Sabha seats across eight states. This was the first major voting exercise since the pandemic prompted sweeping measures in March to ensure social distancing to check its spread. The polls were earlier scheduled for March.Nearly 1,000 legislators participated in the polling in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Manipur, Mizoram, Meghalaya and Rajasthan. Meghalaya’s chief electoral officer, F R Kharkongor, called the election challenging and added they revisited their entire rulebook and re-evaluated the procedure. “But after a few hiccups, we managed fine.”Another EC official in the state said a coughing legislator sent them into a tizzy for a few seconds. “But once the doctor examined the legislator, we realised it was because the legislator choked on something...”The official said the people in their part of the country always greet each with handshakes but this time all they saw were namastes as the lawmakers sought to ensure social distancing. In Andhra Pradesh, a poll official said entourages that normally accompany the chief minister and senior ministers when they come to vote were subdued.The official said guidelines were sent to all legislators that also said they should travel to the polling venue with as few people as possible. The legislators in Andhra wore colourful masks as they turned out to vote. “Some were even wearing their party symbol on their masks,” the official said. “Unlike previous elections, the mood was somber. Electors came, voted, and left almost immediately.”Andhra Pradesh’s chief electoral officer, K Vijayanand, said no one took off their masks, even as they voted and a majority were wearing gloves.The Madhya Pradesh official cited above said the atmosphere was more “businesslike”. “Normally there is a lot of chit chat. Legislators hang around after they are done and gossip for hours, but this time, everyone kept their distance, voted, and left...”A poll official in Gujarat said the discharge and an end to the quarantine period of three lawmakers tested Covid-19 positive helped smoothen the election process.Gujarat’s additional chief electoral officer, Ashok Manek, said everyone was careful and maintained social distancing norms. “Extra care was taken and everyone was screened at the entrance of the [polling venue].” The election was “smooth sailing”, said Rajasthan’s top poll official Anand Kumar. “...[We] were extra cautious. But all in all, it went off pretty well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1-000-leaders-clad-in-safety-gear-cast-votes-for-rs-seats/story-YUtQ3gwx7rRHsViNY4bY0I.html
20-06-2020||India||BJP wins two seats in MP, Scindia enters Upper House||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s Jyotiraditya Scindia, Sumer Singh Solanki and Digvijaya Singh of the Congress were elected to Rajya Sabha from Madhya Pradesh on Friday. The polling for the three seats was scheduled to be held on March 26, but it was deferred due to the Covid-19 pandemic.Scindia, a former Union minister, got 56, Solanki 55, and Digvijaya 57 votes. Congress’s Phool Singh Baraiya, who contested unsuccessfully, managed just 36 votes. A candidate needed 52 votes to win. Two votes were rejected during the polling. In a video message posted on Twitter, Scindia thanked BJP’s leaders and lawmakers. “Given the responsibility bestowed on me with my election to Rajya Sabha from my home state, I will work with all my capabilities for the progress and development of Madhya Pradesh along with chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan and under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, under the guidance of BJP national president JP Nadda and Union home minister Amit Shah.”Scindia, a four-time Lok Sabha member, joined the BJP in March when the resignations of 22 Congress brought down chief minister Kamal Nath’s government. The BJP returned to power in the state after 15 months in March.It will be the second consecutive Rajya Sabha term for Digvijaya Singh, who is a former Madhya Pradesh chief minister. Addressing Congress workers Digvijaya Singh said, “I am grateful to the party leadership, state Congress president Kamal Nath, all the party MLAs, and other leaders and workers for their faith in and support to me. Now, we have to work for the party’s prospects in the by-polls to 24 state assembly seats. We all have to fight against the BJP under the leadership of Kamal Nath.”Solanki is a Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh functionary from Madhya Pradesh’s Nima region. He will be serving as a Rajya Sabha member for the first time.All 206 members of the Madhya Pradesh assembly voted. They included a Congress lawmaker, who has tested positive for Covid-19. He was last to vote on Friday. The BJP has a strength of 107 in the assembly while Congress has 92 members. There are four independent, two Bahujan Samaj Party and the lone Samajwadi Party (SP) lawmaker in the 230-member assembly. There are 24 seats vacant seats in the House.The SP expelled its lawmaker, Rajesh Shukla, for voting for the BJP.The polling started earlier at 9 am and ended at 4 pm. It was held with social distancing measures in place in view of the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-wins-two-seats-in-mp-scindia-enters-upper-house/story-C3EERYn8FSnkl7GRjjnhzL.html
20-06-2020||India||Power balance shifts in Upper House||The National Democratic Alliance (NDA) bagged 11 of the 24 Rajya Sabha seats that went to the polls on Thursday, bringing the ruling coalition within striking distance of the majority mark in the 245 member-strong Upper House of Parliament and in a much better position to manoeuvre position to clear crucial bills.The ruling alliance now has 101 members in the Rajya Sabha. The Bharatiya Janata Party alone commands 86 seats – of which 11 were won on Thursday.With the help of parties such as the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam in Tamil Nadu (9 seats), the Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party in Andhra Pradesh (6), the Biju Janata Dal in Odisha (9), the Mizo National Front in Mizoram (1) and four nominated members, the NDA is in a position to breach the majority mark of 123 in the Upper House. These parties have backed the NDA on a number of key pieces of legislation in the past – for instance, during the passage of the controversial Jammu and Kashmir Reorganization Bill that bifurcated the erstwhile border state into two Union territories last year.Four nominated members are also expected to back the ruling coalition. The opposition United Progressive Alliance has 65 members in the Upper House with the Congress having 44 seats.Among the big names who won were senior BJP leader and former Union minister Jyotiraditya Scindia, former Jharkhand chief minister Shibu Soren, and former prime minister HD Devegowda.The numerical boost for the NDA that can now hope to breach the halfway mark with like-minded parties is significant as the Narendra Modi government has signalled its intent to roll out bold reforms to attract more investments in the post-Covid world order.The government has already asked the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DIPPT) to prepare a document to woo investors in China and according to officials involved in the process, major reforms that require parliamentary sanctions would be part of the new policy.The NDA’s numbers assume significance because the government faced a stiff challenge in the Upper House in its first term because it didn’t enjoy a majority. The government failed to push through some key bills, such as the land acquisition bill.But things started to change after Narendra Modi returned to power with a thumping majority in summer last year. The NDA now enjoys a massive majority in the Lok Sabha with 335 of the 543 seats.Soon after Modi was re-elected in May last year, cracks started appearing in Opposition unity. Bills to ban triple talaq, bifurcate Jammu & Kashmir into two Union territories and the resolution to effectively scrap Article 370 passed in the Upper House. The added strength of the coalition can also come handy to tackle any possible Opposition criticism for the government’s handling of the conflict between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh, the handling of the economy and the Covid pandemic. In the past few weeks, the Opposition has criticised the government, especially over the plight of migrant workers and the issue is likely to come up during the upcoming monsoon session of Parliament. The government has a long list of pending bills that it aims to push through quickly in Parliament. These include the two labour codes—industrial relations and social security— that are aimed to reform the labour market to woo investors. The government also is keen to clear the Personal Data Protection Bill, a contentious legislation that aims to deal with securing data of private people. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy (Amendment) Bill and the surrogacy bill are in the pipeline.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/power-balance-shifts-in-upper-house/story-e5uO8XKtH36QiV9N3pbPmM.html
20-06-2020||India||‘State-backed’ hackers hit Australia govt, businesses||Australia is being targeted by a widespread cyber attack originating from a “state-based” actor, the country’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison said at a press conference on Friday, giving details of what some expert said indicated a link to China. The attacks targeted the government, public services and private businesses, the PM said. In more details released by the Australian Cyber Security Centre, the cyber campaign –named ‘copy-paste compromises’ appeared to deploy techniques available publicly and exploited known flaws in some specific products and protocols. “This activity is targeting Australian organisations across a range of sectors, including all levels of government, industry, political organisations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure,” Morrison said, according to news agency AFP, adding: “we know it is a sophisticated state-based cyber-actor because of the scale and nature of the targeting and the tradecraft used.” While the Australian PM did not name any country, cyber security experts said the strongest suspicion fell on China. “Many states have good cyber capabilities, but there are very few states that have the capability at the scale the Prime Minister talked about, affecting so many industries. The ones that possibly could at that scale: Russian, US, UK, China. I don’t see any motivation for the first three -- they’ve either got a good relationship with us or have far higher priorities,” said Tom Uren, senior analyst at Australian Strategic Policy Institute’s (ASPI) International Cyber Policy Centre.“Australia has been on China’s radar for years, and they have previously compromised all of the industries that the PM mentioned,” he said in an interview over email. The analyst added that the present attack appeared to be for stealing information instead of causing disruption or destruction.The revelations in Australia come at a time when there have been concerns about cyber attacks from China targeting Indian digital infrastructure as a consequence of the escalation in hostilities between the two countries in Ladakh. HT reported on Thursday intelligence inputs that some attacks from China-based actors had been launched on Indian networks such as payment and ATM networks.“In a conflict, espionage for military advantage is a dead certainty, but I’m not sure that China would try to disrupt Indian operations with cyber capabilities unless the conflict really escalated,” Uren said.He added that an attack of the kind seen in Australia could impact several sectors with valuable information. According to news agency AFP, Australia’s public broadcaster ABC cited “senior sources” confirming that China was believed to be behind the attacks.Australia has in recent weeks enraged China by calling for an investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic and by accusing China of fuelling a virus “infodemic” and engaging in economic “coercion”. China -- increasingly unwilling to tolerate criticism of its more aggressive foreign policies -- has warned its students and tourists against going to Australia, threatened more sanctions and sentenced an Australian citizen to death for drug trafficking.(With inputs from AFP)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-backed-hackers-hit-australia-govt-businesses/story-BiNUjI0Bblr8RRqzRKBYhI.html
20-06-2020||India||Chinese side makes fresh claim on Galwan Valley||A day after India rubbished China’s claim of sovereignty over Galwan Valley, at the heart of a tense border standoff between the two sides, Beijing on Friday claimed the region on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control and had been patrolled by its troops for “many years”.The claim was made in what was described as a “step by step account of the Galwan clash” by Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian that was posted on the Chinese embassy’s website shortly before midnight on Friday.China’s People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) western command had in a statement issued on Tuesday initially raised the issue, saying: “The sovereignty of the Galwan River Valley has always been ours.”Also Read: ‘Taught them a lesson’: PM Modi explains the big picture in stand-off with ChinaOn Thursday, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had dismissed the PLA’s claim as “exaggerated and untenable”.On Monday night, Indian and Chinese troops were involved in a seven-hour violent face-off in Galwan Valley that left 20 Indian soldiers dead and at least 76 injured. Another 10 Indian soldiers held by the Chinese side were released on Thursday.The so-called “step by step account” by Zhao said: “The Galwan Valley is located on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control in the west section of the China-India boundary. For many years, the Chinese border troops have been patrolling and on duty in this region.”It further claimed that since April, Indian troops had “unilaterally and continuously built roads, bridges and other facilities at the LAC in the Galwan Valley”. China made representations and protests on multiple occasions but “India has gone even further to cross the LAC and make provocations”, Zhao said.Also Read: Ladakh isn’t South China Sea, will not allow status quo to change: OfficialZhao contended Indian troops crossed the LAC by night and trespassed into China’s territory on May 6 and then “built fortification and barricades, which impeded the patrol of Chinese border troops”.They deliberately made provocations in an attempt to unilaterally change the status quo of control and management. The Chinese border troops have been forced to take necessary measures to respond to the situation on the ground and strengthen management and control in the border areas.Referring to a meeting of senior Indian and Chinese military commanders held on June 6, Zhao said the two sides “reached consensus on easing the situation”. He claimed the Indian side “promised that they would not cross the estuary of the Galwan river to patrol and build facilities” and the two sides would discuss and decide the phased withdrawal of troops”.Zhao claimed that on June 15, Indian troops violated the agreement reached on June 6 and “once again crossed the Line of Actual Control for deliberate provocation…and even violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went there for negotiation, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties”.He reiterated various accusations levelled by the Chinese side in recent days about the violation of agreements.There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to Zhao’s account.A readout issued by the external affairs ministry after a phone conversation between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Chinese counterpart Wang Yi on June 17 had clearly accused Chinese troops of provoking the clash on June 15 by entering the Indian side of the LAC.The readout had said the Chinese side “sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on our side of the LAC”. It had added: “While this became a source of dispute, the Chinese side took pre-meditated and planned action that was directly responsible for the resulting violence and casualties. It reflected an intent to change the facts on ground in violation of all our agreements to not change the status quo.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-side-makes-fresh-claim-on-galwan-valley/story-r3NGSr5emL8Y0YORgHcH2O.html
20-06-2020||India||Is China eyeing new world order?||Is China using the world’s preoccupation with the Covid-19 crisis to enlarge its position on several border disputes and target rivals that could have a say in shaping the post-pandemic global order? That’s a question now being debated by experts and analysts following a string of actions by China over the past few weeks and months.India-China border standoff:The most urgent of the crises is the tense weeks-old face-off between Indian and Chinese border troops in the Ladakh sector of the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that has sparked at least three clashes since early May, the latest being the violent brawl of June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.India has accused China of taking “premeditated and planned action” that reflected an intent to change the status quo on the LAC.Reasons advanced for China’s actions have ranged from anger over India’s beefing up of infrastructure along the strategic Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road and India’s decision last August to scrap Jammu and Kashmir’s special status and create the union territory of Ladakh, which Beijing has indicated had an impact on its territorial claims in the region. Experts have also pointed to China’s desire to protect its considerable investments in the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, a key part of which is located in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir.Australia cyber attack:The Australian government said on Friday it was dealing with a massive cyberattack targeting all levels of the administration, industry, education, essential services, critical infrastructure, and political organisations. Prime Minister Scott Morrison said a malicious and sophisticated “state-based cyber actor” was behind the attack, adding that “there are not a large number of state-based actors that can engage in this type of activity”.Though Morrison didn’t name any country, Australian experts and observers pointed the finger at China. Peter Jennings, executive director of the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, told CNN there was a “95% chance that it is China who is responsible for this attack”.Australia has been vocal in recent months about an international investigation into the origins of the Covid-19 pandemic and backed India’s calls for reforms of the World Health Organization for its initial handling of the crisis. China retaliated with tariffs on Australian exports, including barley and beef. India and Australia have also spoken about working together to shape the post-Covid world order.South China Sea:There has been no let-up in China’s activities to bolster its presence in the South China Sea, where it is embroiled in maritime boundary disputes with several countries, despite the Covid-19 pandemic. A Vietnamese vessel was rammed by a Chinese ship near Paracel Islands on June 10, months after another Vietnamese boat was sunk by China’s coast guard in the same area. Numerous Chinese vessels have been spotted near Thitu Island, controlled by the Philippines but claimed by China. Earlier this month, Filipino authorities launched work on critical infrastructure on Thitu, located just 24 km from an artificial island created by China and equipped with radars and missiles. Over the past two months, an exploration vessel operated by Malaysia’s state-run oil company Petronas has been harassed in the South China Sea by Chinese vessels.Of these three countries, Vietnam has often turned to India to back its position in the South China Sea. Last year, Chinese vessels repeatedly operated in areas close to the waters where state-owned ONGC Videsh is engaged in oil and gas production.Senkaku Islands:On Thursday, China set a new record of sorts by sending its vessels into waters off the Senkaku Islands for 66 consecutive days. The islands in the East China Sea are controlled by Tokyo but claimed by Beijing, and Chinese vessels have been spotted in Japan’s “contiguous zone” every day since April 14. The contiguous zone is the area beyond the territorial sea and extending up to 24 nautical miles from the baseline that a country can claim. Technically, the presence of the Chinese vessels is not an intrusion but Japan regards it as a provocation. Japan’s chief cabinet secretary Yoshihide Suga told the media on Wednesday the Senkaku islands are “unquestionably our territory historically and under international law” and that a protest had been lodged with China over the presence of the vessels. “We think it is extremely serious that these activities continue,” he said.Both Japan and India are part of the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad, which was upgraded to the level of foreign ministers last September.Hong Kong:China has never been happy with the “one country, two systems” principle put in place for governing the special administrative region of Hong Kong when it was returned by the UK in 1997. After Hong Kong was roiled by protracted and widespread protests last year over the local administration’s efforts to push a bill that would allow people to be extradited to mainland China for trial, Beijing has moved amid the Covid-19 crisis to draft a new national security law for the region that analysts say will undermine the semi-autonomous region’s systems. The draft law, submitted to a standing committee of the National People’s Congress this week, covers secession, subversion of state power, terror activities, and foreign interference.India, in line with its long-standing policy of not speaking on the domestic and internal politics of China, has not publicly commented on last year’s protests or the new draft law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-orders-riot-gear-for-soldiers/story-qFpA5iJjXY50ZOoE8y4BbO.html
20-06-2020||India||Army orders riot gear for soldiers||New Delhi: The Indian Army has ordered body protective suits and batons for troops deployed along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh, the focus of current tensions with China, to protect them from assaults by Chinese troops, two officers familiar with the development said on Friday.The Chinese troops have been using stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs to inflict serious injuries during border brawls. Twenty Indian soldiers, including a colonel, were killed in a seven-hour brawl in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on Monday night.The order for the suits – essentially light-weight riot gear –was placed with a Mumbai-based firm last month after scores of Indian soldiers, including a colonel, were injured in a separate clash with Chinese troops on the northern bank of Ladakh’s Pangong Lake on the night of May 5-6, said one of the two cited above.Indian and Chinese soldiers have been caught in a tense confrontation along the disputed border since rival patrols clashed near Pangong Lake last month.The soldiers along the LAC will get 500 sets of protective suits soon in the first instalment, said a second officer. The army has ordered a total of around 2,000 sets of protective suits and batons, he said.The tensions escalated significantly after the brutal clash between Indian and Chinese troops in the Galwan Valley on June 15. Both sides suffered casualties. The Chinese soldiers employed the same modus operandi and attacked Indian troops with stones, iron rods and nail-studded clubs.Two retired senior commanders that Hindustan Times spoke to said it was inappropriate to supply riot gear to soldiers as their role was not the same as policemen.The June 15 clash also left 76 Indian soldiers injured, including 18 seriously, officials said. All of them are now stable.Indian Army officials have said 43 Chinese were killed or seriously injured, citing radio intercepts and other intelligence. The Chinese fatal casualties reportedly include a colonel, but HT could not independently verify this.The Galwan Valley clash took the relationship between the two nuclear powers to an all-time low.It came on a day army delegations from India and China held talks at two locations along the LAC – brigadier-rank officers met in the Galwan Valley and colonel-rank officers in Hot Springs – as part of continuing efforts to de-escalate and disengage.According to an agreement on confidence-building measures along the LAC, signed by India and China in November 1996, both sides do not open fire or conduct blast operations within two kilometres of the de facto border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-orders-riot-gear-for-soldiers/story-smVKpbkLdbfldaPM8haxXO.html
20-06-2020||India||Army builds bridge over Galwan river||New Delhi: Indian Army engineers on Thursday completed a crucial 60-metre-long bridge over the Galwan river in eastern Ladakh -- at the heart of the conflict between India and China in the region -- despite hostile moves by the Peoples Liberation Army (PLA) to stall the project, people familiar with the matter said.The Bailey bridge (a prefabricated bridge developed by the British during World War 2) will help consolidate India’s hold of the sensitive sector by allowing infantry to move across the cold mountain river and also protect the 255km road from Darbuk to Daulat Beg Oldie, the last military post just south of the Karakoram Pass, the officials cited above added on condition of anonymity.The construction of the strategic bridge, which replaces a footbridge on the Galwan River, was a key trigger for the aggressive maneuvers by PLA in eastern Ladakh over several weeks, before the Chinese army’s Western Theatre Command this month made an exaggerated claim to the entire Galwan Valley.“We did not stop work on this bridge through the stand-off and kept working despite the violent face-off on June 15,” a senior army officer said.A senior government official confirmed, on condition of anonymity, that the bridge was completed on Thursday even as tensions raged after the June 15 clash in which 20 Indian soldiers and some Chinese troops were killed. China watchers described this as a signal from India that the border infrastructure upgrade projects being executed by formation engineers and the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) will continue despite PLA’s attempts to stall them.The four-span bridge is located 3km east of the confluence of the Shyok and Galwan rivers, with the contested Patrol Point 14 a further 2km east of the new bridge. Patrol Point 14, which was the site of the June 15 clash, is close to the Y-junction where the Galwan rivulet joins the main river. An Indian army base camp, “120 km camp” is located at the confluence of the two rivers and next to the Darbuk-Shyok-Daulat Beg Oldie (DSDBO) road.Experts said the Chinese claim to the entire Galwan valley was an attempt to reduce the Indian claim line to the Shyok river; to allow PLA to overrun the DSDBO road in times of hostility and cut off Daulat Beg Oldie, and so that it can open another road to Pakistan via Murgo, the last Indian village before Daulat Beg Oldie.Indian security officials told HT last month that Chinese action in the area was to “dominate the region” and “deter India” from completing the DSDBO road, which, once fully metalled, would give India a major advantage in terms of access and military mobilisation. A key part of this was the construction of the new bridge.The bridge, built on concrete pillars, gives India a major advantage in terms of access and military mobilisation and is vital to the protection of Indian strategic interests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-builds-bridge-over-galwan-river/story-eHjtuUJtfQP73chysMurlL.html
20-06-2020||India||IAF chief visits forward airbases||NEW DELHI: Two days after 20 Indian soldiers were killed in a brutal clash with Chinese troops in Galwan Valley, Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria made a low-key visit to Ladakh to review the Indian Air Force’s preparedness in the sensitive sector where the IAF is operating its fighter jets and new attack and heavy-lift helicopters, people familiar with the development said on Friday on condition of anonymity.Apart from Sukhoi-30s and upgraded MiG-29 fighter jets, the IAF is operating Apache AH-64E attack helicopters and CH-47F (I) Chinook multi-mission helicopters --- both imported from the United States --- in the sector that has been the focus of current border tensions with China, said one of the persons cited above. The IAF chief visited the forward airbases --- Leh on Wednesday and Srinagar on Thursday --- at a time of increased Chinese military activity across the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) where Indian and Chinese troops have been caught in a tense confrontation for over seven weeks and efforts to de-escalate have failed.“In these times of heightened alert, the movement of air force assets is to be expected and hence basing of fighters and helicopters upfront is but normal and should not lead to any extreme deductions,” said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.The Chinese deployment in its so-called “depth areas” or areas within its side of the LAC includes more than 8,000 troops, tanks, artillery guns, fighter bombers, rocket forces and air defence radars. Satellite imagery has revealed a Chinese buildup in the Galwan Valley and fresh inputs also suggest heightened Chinese activity in the Finger Area (a cluster of strategic features) near Pangong Tso where new Chinese positions and observation posts have come up in the last six to seven weeks, said the second person cited above.“The Finger Area is sensitive and the armies need to disengage there,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations. He said both sides had hardened their positions along the LAC but talks were on to resolve the border row.Bhadauria visited the Ladakh sector at a time when the Indian armed forces are on the highest state of alert to deal with any threat to national security following the significant escalation of the border conflict with China.The Chinese PLA is fully deployed in Xinjiang and Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) with air, artillery and missile support, and the PLA Air Force has activated its bases in both Xinjiang and TAR with fighter aircraft making a show of strength in Aksai Chin area, as reported by Hindustan Times on Friday.The army has strengthened its posture across the length of the LAC --- from Ladakh to Uttarakhand, Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh --- where reinforcements have been sent and the IAF also has kept its contingency plans ready, the officials said.Tensions have surged between India and China after the June 15 Galwan skirmish that marked the first Indian casualties in a border clash with the People’s Liberation Army since October 1975 when Chinese troops ambushed an Indian patrol in Arunachal Pradesh’s Tulung La sector and shot four soldiers dead.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-visits-forward-airbases/story-u1S7WgReb8HTnNQKaAFQDI.html
20-06-2020||India||Debriefing of 10 soldiers released by China begins||Intense negotiations through diplomatic and military channels, including three rounds of talks between senior Army officers, led to the release of 10 Indian soldiers detained by the Chinese side after the violent brawl on June 15 in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley, people familiar with developments said on Friday on the condition of anonymity.The soldiers were being debriefed by senior officers at Leh, the headquarters of the Army’s 14 Corps, on the over 60 hours they spent in Chinese custody, said one of the persons cited above. “There’s a protocol for debriefing and that’s being followed,” he said.Another person said the 10 soldiers, including two majors and two captains, were returned to the Indian side on Thursday evening, three days after the violent face-off along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) that left 20 Indian soldiers, including a colonel, dead.“The debriefing is critical. It will be a formatted military narration of what they went through in Chinese captivity. This will form the basis of what really happened during those three days and how was the military posturing and conduct of the people who detained them,” said Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd), a former army vice chief.The negotiations for their release were kept tightly under wraps due to concerns for the safety of the soldiers amid the heightened tensions between the two sides, said the first person cited above.There was no official word on the development. All that the Indian Army and the external affairs ministry said on Thursday was that no Indian soldiers were “missing in action”.“The release of the Indian soldiers reflects Chinese intent. It perhaps shows the Chinese want to de-escalate and disengage,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director-general of military operations.However, a top retired army commander, who did not want to be identified, said China had already achieved what it set out to achieve – gaining control over the Galwan Valley and the strategic feature Finger 4 near Pangong Tso Lake, where a significant Chinese buildup has taken place over the last six weeks.“The gesture of returning the soldiers is a message to the world that they [the Chinese] are not the aggressors and they have returned people who intruded into their territory,” he said.The release of the 10 soldiers figured in three rounds of talks between Indian and Chinese delegations, led by major generals, near Patrol Point 14 in the Galway Valley between Tuesday and Thursday. Major General Abhijit Bapat, commander of Karu-based 3 Infantry Division, and his Chinese counterpart met for the third time on Thursday.The meetings were part of ongoing military engagements to de-escalate the situation and to disengage on the disputed border. The two senior military officers have met seven times since the stand-off began in early May.The 10 soldiers were medically examined and found to be in good health, said the second person cited above.Monday night’s seven-hour brutal clash involving over 500 rival troops also marked the first time India has suffered combat fatalities in an incident involving Chinese troops since 1975.Following reports that an unspecified number of soldiers were unaccounted for after Monday night’s clash, the Army had on Thursday only said that none of its personnel were missing in action.“It is clarified that there are no Indian troops missing in action,” the army said in a statement. An army spokesperson had said the statement was in reference to an article published in The New York Times on Wednesday.Asked about the specific issue of the status of Indian soldiers after the clash on June 15, external affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava told a weekly media briefing on Thursday: “This has been clarified by the army earlier today afternoon that there are no Indian troops missing in action.”China has so far not acknowledged any casualties while 76 Indian soldiers were also injured. The Army has said 43 Chinese were killed or seriously injured, citing radio intercepts and other intelligence. The Chinese fatal casualties reportedly include a colonel-ranked officer but HT could not independently verify this.India has attributed the clash of June 15 to Chinese forces crossing to the Indian side of the LAC and attempting to build a structure. It has also rejected China’s People’s Liberation Army’s claim of sovereignty over the Galwan Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/debriefing-of-10-soldiers-released-by-china-begins/story-XF40qIzathvpbHPNh1Ib4M.html
20-06-2020||India||Govt may standardise wages for private security||The Centre is considering bringing about nine million private security guards under the purview of Code on Wages, 2019, to ensure uniform minimum wages for them nationally, Union home ministry officials said. State governments currently regulate the private security sector and wages of guards differ from one state to another. Parliament passed the code last year to guarantee a minimum wage to hundreds of millions of workers and to have set standard wages nationally. The rules for the code are being framed. According to the code, minimum wages will no longer be based on employment but on geography and skills. The code seeks to ensure timely payment of minimum wages and offers legislative protection to over 500 million workers in the unorganised sector.In a video conference with over 250 CEOs of private security agencies from all over the country and Central Association of Private Security Industry (CAPSI) on Friday, home ministry officials assured the guards will be taken care of in terms of wages, bonus, timely payment of salaries, overtime and social security schemes. CAPSI chairman Kunwar Vikram Singh said the proposed move will have a positive impact on the security guards, who have worked very efficiently across all sectors. “The home ministry has appreciated the role of private security agencies/guards particularly in the fight against Covid-19 pandemic and noted the difficulties they face,” he said. The officials cited above said the ministry will soon release the amendments to the Private Security Agencies Regulation Act, which will create a new regime for ease to doing business for private security agencies. As per the new rules, security agencies are expected to be able to offer designations to the guards, etc. Applications for the licences are likely to be eased and digital payments are expected to be allowed to pay the fees for them. Around 9 million security guards are registered with over 23,000 private security agencies and they are deployed at government offices, retail outlets, malls, restaurants, movie theatres, residential complexes etc. In Delhi alone, there are around 375,000 security guards and around 350,000 in Gurugram, according to CAPSI data. MHA officials did not offer any further comments on the proposal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-standardise-wages-for-pvt-security/story-IsxOzzzTmpg5V4BToHrGHL.html
20-06-2020||India||Suspended J&K cop granted bail; to be in jail in NIA case||A Delhi court on Friday granted bail to suspended Jammu and Kashmir DSP Davinder Singh after the Delhi police failed to file charge sheet against him during the statutory period of 90 days in a conspiracy case. However, Singh continues to remain in the jail in the case probed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in which he was arrested while ferrying two Hizb-ul-Mujahideen terrorists in a vehicle on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway early this year.Additional Sessions Judge Dharmendra Rana granted bail to Singh and another accused--Irfan Shafi Mir on a personal bond of Rs 1 lakh with two sureties of like amount in the case that Delhi police had filed.In March, the Delhi police’s special cell(anti terror unit) filed a case against Singh, for alleged criminal conspiracy and activities against the interest of the country.“…considering the fact that despite the lapse of statutory time limit to complete investigation, charge sheet in the instant matter has not been filed till date, both the applicants/accused persons, namely Davinder Singh and Irfan Shafi Mir are entitled to be released on bail….,” the judge said in its order.The court’s order comes after both the accused moved a bail application through their counsel MS Khan stating that both Singh and Mir were arrested on March 14 and March 19 respectively and have been in custody since then.Advocate Khan told the court that the statutory period to file the charge sheet has also elapsed and hence his clients should be granted bail. He also contended that there is no evidence to connect the accused with any terrorist outfit or to show the existence of any conspiracy.Singh and Mir were booked by the Special Cell under section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). The police claimed the duo was training young people from Jammu and Kashmir and Punjab to carry out terrorist activities. The two were brought to Delhi to investigate whether there were plans to carry out terror activities in Delhi.Singh is also being investigated by the NIA after he was arrested on January 10 while ferrying two terrorists on the Srinagar-Jammu Highway.Davinder Singh was intercepted when he was travelling on the national highway to Jammu along with two Hizbul Mujahideen commanders Naveed Babu, Rafi Ahmed Rather. Singh, suspected of going rogue, was arrested under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act, or UAPA, the anti-terror law.“Accused Davinder Singh continues to be in judicial custody in NIA case. We have adequate evidence against him and he will be chargesheeted in due course,” an NIA spokesperson said.During a search of the car, one AK-47 assault rifles, three pistols, five hand grenades, 174 live rounds of AK-47 and 36 live rounds of pistol ammunition and other incriminating material were recovered. After initial investigations by the Jammu and Kashmir Police, the case was taken over by NIA and several teams of the central agency have been questioning the suspended police officer in Jammu.A senior Delhi Police officer said on condition of anonymity that the special cell is in “no hurry to file a charge sheet just because there is a statutory time limit”.“We arrested him because we had inputs about his links. We worked on the information derived from him during interrogation and even made some arrests based on that. But we will file a charge sheet only when we have strong evidence against him that will stand in court,” said the officer.“The main terror charges against him continue to stand and he remains in jail,” the officer added.Reacting to Singh’s bail, Congress MP Shashi Tharoor tweeted-- “We all want to ask “How did the government allow this to happen?”But the real question is “How do we as Indians allow the government to get away with this shameful non-performance?”( sic)To this, NIA replied on Twitter, “Delhi Police had arrested Davinder Singh in a separate case. He continues to be in judicial custody in NIA case. Investigation is in full swing in NIA case and a chargesheet will be filed against Davinder Singh and other accused persons in the first week of July, 2020.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/suspended-j-k-cop-granted-bail-to-be-in-jail-in-nia-case/story-8al1wLwop5WUWk2D9aMzqK.html

Also, there were allegations that migrants had to pay for their journey home. “We issued appropriate directions to all states (on June 9). All migrant workers have to be transported in 15 days,” the bench of justices Ashok Bhushan, SK Kaul and MR Shah said, reiterating its order through video conferencing. “Our order is very clear that no migrant worker has to pay for the ticket.” Senior advocate Gopal Shankaranaraynan, who appeared for the National Law Universities Alumni Association, told the court that members of his group were helping migrants stuck in Maharashtra to reach destinations in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand. He alleged that there was lack of information on the trains.He complained that migrants were being asked to pay for tickets. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the Centre will make available trains within 24 hours of receiving a request. The court posted the matter on July 8 to monitor implementation of its directions.States and Union territories received a mandate on June 9 from the court to ensure the return of all workers stranded by the lockdown to their home states and to inform it about welfare programmes, including job opportunities, they plan to offer the returnees.The court also asked states and Union territories to identify migrant workers who have returned and prepare an inventory of the vocational skills they possess and their employment history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keep-june-24-deadline-to-send-migrants-home-sc-tells-states/story-i155sK4xLaeRL1ql3VeH1M.html
20-06-2020||India||Antiviral drug gets regulatory approval||Glenmark Pharmaceuticals on Thursday announced that it received approval from India’s drug regulator, the drugs controller general of India (DCGI), to manufacture and market the oral antiviral drug Favipiravir to treat mild to moderate Covid-19 cases in India. The drug will be marketed under the brand name ‘FabiFlu’.The drug is known to inhibit virus replication and in April, the company was the first to receive approval from the regulator to conduct clinical trials in the country.“This approval has been granted based on evaluation of data and in consultation with the Subject Expert Committee, as part of accelerated approval process, considering the emergency situation and unmet medical need of the Covid-19 outbreak. It is for restricted emergency use in India. Restricted use entails responsible medication use where every patient must have signed informed consent before treatment initiation,” said company in a statement.Favipiravir, sold under the brand name Avigan in Japan, is used to treat influenza in that country. What Glenmark is producing is a generic version of Avigan, the company had said in an earlier statement. In the past few months, post the outbreak of Covid-19, multiple clinical trials have been initiated on Covid-19 patients in China, Japan and in the US.“Having internally developed the Active Pharmaceutical Ingredient (API), and the formulations for the product, Glenmark filed the product for clinical trials with the DCGI and has received approval for conducting the trial on mild to moderate patients,” the company had said.The treatment duration is a maximum of 14 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/antiviral-drug-gets-regulatory-approval/story-Wz1COgwYdUfdnTj6sgak9J.html
20-06-2020||India||Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai gear up for Covid-19 spikes||First, some projections. By the end of this month, going only by the rise in new cases since June 8, when Unlock 1.0 came into force, the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Mumbai would be 80,000; 100,000 in New Delhi and 71,000 in Chennai, which officials of all three metropolises agree, would greatly test their health infrastructure.The unlock guidelines, crucial to restart economic activities and prepare the country to learn to live with Covid-19, has led to a spurt in cases in most states. Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai however, account for more than half of the total cases in the country today. These cities are among the 65 most critical Covid-19 affected districts in the country, according to the latest analysis of the health ministry shared with state governments.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), which is handling Covid-19 cases in the Mumbai, estimates that if the same pace of increase continues, the business capital of the country will have around 80,000 cases by the end June and over 100,000 by mid July.Suresh Kakani, BMC’s additional municipal commissioner, said that the numbers have stabilised in the past month. But that doesn’t mean they’re not large enough to cause concern: in the past month, Mumbai has seen a daily addition of anywhere between 1,000 to 1,700 cases. [June 16 fell short of the lower end of that range by 19 cases.] “The numbers have stabilised for now, but we cannot estimate saturation point. We will have to wait for one more week,” he said. On Friday, Mumbai’s case count was 64,139 (1264 fresh cases), and 3425 deaths (114 new deaths). The mortality rate in the city was 5.33%. The BMC officials said assuming that 1,500 cases are reported in the city every day for another 12 days, the city will have 81,000 cases by June end. To cope with the increase in cases, the BMC has set up 90 clinics in areas where the concentration of cases is highest, such as Dharavi, Worli Koliwada, Mankhurd and Govandi, and also stepped up screening efforts in other areas by setting up additional 400 fever clinics. “We have conducted over 2.69 lakh tests, and are maintaining daily number of tests being conducted at 4,500 to 5,000. In the last one week, we have touched the 5,000-mark on June 12 and June 16. Our capacity is to conduct around 7,000-8,000 tests daily,” Kakani said.The high number cases doesn’t indicate that the city has reached its peak, experts said. Thus, the city must prepare for the eventuality that it hasn’t.Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant said, “In the last one month capacity of the medical health infrastructure has doubled, and the cases have risen from around 15,000 to 60,000. We will have to scale up at a much faster rate, if we are of the belief that the peak in Mumbai has yet not arrived.” He added that the occupancy rate of the ICU beds and ventilators was above 90% on any given day. Chennai, by comparison, has fewer cases than Mumbai, but it accounts for 70% of the total cases in Tamil Nadu. The state government, on June 15, announced a complete lockdown starting Friday and till the end of the month in Chennai and three adjoining districts, Chengapattu, Thiruvallur and Kancheepuram. The lockdown was enforced after there was a steady rise in cases, an increase in deaths and lack of public cooperation in maintaining social distancing and wearing masks. After the first case was reported on March 24, by June 7 -- a day before Unlock 1.0 was to start -- Chennai had 22149 out of the state’s 31667 cases. Ten days later, Chennai breached the 35000-mark while Tamil Nadu crossed the 50000-mark. This month, the state has reported more than 1,000 new cases everyday with Chennai accounting for most of them. In the first week of May state-run Tamil Nadu Dr MGR Medical University projected that Chennai would have roughly 71000 cases by June-end and 150,000 cases by the second week of July. However, this forecast may change with the imposition of the 12-day lockdown.“Rather than focussing all resources on 1 million people in the containment zones, the city now has to control its entire population of 8 million,” said a member of the task force constituted to recommend ways to control spread of Covid-19, who was not willing to be named.To deal with the increase in cases, Chennai has prepared a micro-level plan for each of 200 wards in the city with an assistant engineer in-charge at each ward. The Chennai municipal corporation is conducting door-to-door surveys for its 8.4 million population and has set up more than 400 fever camps and 10 mobile sample collection centres.“We need a maximum of 30,000-35,000 beds to manage our peak,” city corporation commissioner G Prakash had announced on June 7. He added that 20000 additional staff nurses and 2,000 paramedics were appointed in June for Chennai and its three neighbouring districts. There is no clear data of daily testing figures in Chennai, but it is roughly pegged at 5,000. According to the health bulletin released on June 19, 160,000 samples have been tested in the city so far. Tamil Nadu, which was testing around 18,000 samples a day has ramped up testing to 25,000 daily in the past three days alone. However, experts say that to assess and control the spread of the disease, Chennai alone needs to test at least 10,000 people per day. “We began easing lockdown norms since May but did not significantly ramp up testing in Chennai or plan an aggressive containment strategy to restrict the cases geographically,” said a member of the government-appointed medical expert panel quoted above. As of June 19, Tamil Nadu has tested 789, 408 individuals, which is 71,725 more than the people Maharashtra has tested and 60% more than Gujarat’s test numbers.“For this lockdown to be effective, we need aggressive testing and early isolation of people with symptoms and their contacts. If a person starting to show symptoms is isolated within 3 to 4 days, the transmission can be cut by half,” says Dr Prabhdeep Kaur, a member of the government appointed expert medical panel and deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology.In Delhi, the average daily increase of confirmed cases has grown by 9% against 6% daily average for the 11 days prior to Unlock 1.0. On June 9, the Delhi government had projected that the total Covid cases (including recoveries) would be around 1,00,007 by June 30 and 2,24,537 by July 15. Even though the fatality rate (the number of people who succumbed to the virus) is at 5.5% now, versus 3.7% prior to June 8, the recovery rate has improved from 27% to 49% in the 11-day period. Delhi is conducting more tests than before and as on June 19, it has conducted 15,400 tests per million with positivity rate of 31%, up from 7% on May 17.To cope with the anticipated increase in cases, the Delhi government plans to have 80,000 beds by end of July from the present 10,889. The government has identified 40 hotels (4,628 beds) and 77 banquet halls (11,229 beds) that are being turned into Covid care centres (to add 15,800 beds immediately), said Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. In addition to this, the city government is planning to build the country’s biggest Covid Care Centre at a religious institute in South Delhi Bhati area, which will add 10,000 more beds in the city.

20-06-2020||India||Pride and patriotism prevail as Galwan Valley clash martyrs are laid to rest||More than gloom it was a sense of pride and patriotism that prevailed among the people who had gathered in large numbers to watch the family members perform the last rites of martyred sepoy Rajesh Orang at Belgoria village in south Bengal’s Birbhum district on Friday.26-year-old Orang, was among the 20 soldiers killed in a violent face-off with Chinese troops along the undefined Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh. Bipul Roy from Alipurduar district in north Bengal was also martyred in the same incident. The Army cortege arrived from the Panagarh military hospital, where the body of Orang was kept for the night after a military aircraft brought his Tri-colour draped body from Leh via Chandigarh on Thursday evening.Army personnel carried the coffin to Orang’s home around 9 am, where his family members –father Subhash Orang, mother Mamata Orang and sister Shakuntala Orang - broke down into tears.“We are all proud of him. Given a chance I want to join the Indian Army and avenge his death,” said Abhijit Orang, his cousin. The two had spoken over the phone two weeks before Rajesh was killed.Villagers started shouting patriotic slogans – Bharat mata ki jai, Vande Mataram and Jai Hind - and showered petals as army personnel arrived with Orang’s coffin on their shoulders. People from all across the district had gathered at the otherwise nondescript village of Belgroia from where Orang hailed.“I have come from Dubrajpur which is around 30 km away. I just wanted to get a glimpse of the martyred soldier. I don’t belong to his village. But still I am feeling proud,” said Paresh Bauri, who had come all the way on his bicycle to witness the proceedings.Rajesh’s body was buried in a field at the entrance of the village after a gun salute by the army. Villagers claimed that there are proposals to rename the village after Rajesh Orang. Leader of political parties, including MPs and MLAs, also could be spotted at the occasion.In north Bengal’s Alipurduar district, the mortal remains of martyr Sepoy Bipul Roy was expected to reach the Bindipara village around 4 pm. Thousands of people thronged on both sides of the road leading to the village to pay their last respect. His body was kept at Hasimara air base after it was brought at 9.30 pm Thursday. Bakul Roy, younger brother of Bipul said: “Though I have lost my brother, I want peace to be restored between China and India.“I get scared every time I think about the future of my sister-in-law and niece,” Bakul who works as a daily wage labour in Bhutan said.Bipul Roy’s last rites were completed in his native village in Alipurduar district around 9:30 pm on Friday. Meanwhile, as a mark of protest, Chinese goods were thrown out and set on fire in places like Bagdogra near Siliguri. Protests also erupted in other parts of the state where small groups of people were seen burning effigies of the Chinese President Xi Jinping and raising slogans calling for a boycott of Chinese goods.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pride-and-patriotism-prevail-as-galwan-valley-clash-martyrs-are-laid-to-rest/story-DPm6M2cd0e4n3E1JdSs42N.html
20-06-2020||India||Former PM Deve Gowda urges political leaders to tone down nationalist rhetoric||Former Prime Minister and Janata Dal (Secular) leader Deve Gowda who has recently been re-elected to the Rajya Sabha, on Friday, issued a statement asking for toning down of nationalist rhetoric. Saying that this was not the time for using language of provocation and revenge, he said that media outlets spreading fake information and cheap rhetoric endanger the lives of our soldiers and diplomatic staff.The letter released to the public also asked the opposition parties not to use intemperate language, saying that this was an hour for co-operation. Interestingly Gowda’s statement came on a day when the PM convened an all-party meeting to discuss the Indo-China border standoff. Stating that there is a feeling among our fellow citizens that we are engulfed by hostile nations, he urged the political leadership to ensure that such anxiety is quelled with proper information. He said that a senior serving military officer and a diplomat should make a detailed presentation to opposition leaders on the ground situation. He stated that the demand was not for classified details but truthful information.Criticizing what he said were efforts in recent times to politicise the armed forces, he said that this was a dangerous move and added that it should be allowed to remain a professional force. Urging the government not to encourage reactionary language of economic boycott, the implications of which were deep, he said that the country should be guided by pragmatism. Gowda did not attend the PM’s meet of opposition leaders, as he was not invited, said his office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-pm-deve-gowda-urges-political-leaders-to-tone-down-nationalist-rhetoric/story-mPth6KT7jHDr2tVmpwJshI.html

20-06-2020||India||Rs 50,000-crore public works on the cards for generating jobs||Public works worth Rs 50,000 crore will be offered in a dedicated programme to be launched by Prime Minister Narendra Modi later this month to create jobs for millions of migrant workers who returned home, the government announced on Thursday.The programme, titled Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan, will start from Bihar on June 20 via video conference and the “focused campaign” will run in “mission mode” for 125 days across 116 districts in six states to help migrant workers get jobs, it added.The largest number of migrant workers (three million) have returned to Bihar since the Covid-19 pandemic swept through the country leaving daily-wage labourers jobless in big cities.Watch | PM Modi launches Rs 50,000 crore-scheme to create jobs for migrants “In 125 days, nearly 25 schemes will be brought together to reach saturation. These will include Pradhan Mantri Awas Yojna, Gram Sadak Yojna, Jal Jeevan Yojna, PM Gram Sadak Yojna, etc,” finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said in a press conference on Thursday.The move will not involve new budgetary allocation -- the 25 schemes will be front-loaded, utilising in 125 days the allocation meant for the year, said Sitharaman.Aimed to boosting livelihood opportunities in rural India, the programme will “create durable infrastructure along with boosting employment opportunities,” an official communique said. The Centre’s dependence on the construction to create jobs comes after skill mapping -- in districts where more than 25,000 migrant workers have returned, and run by the rural development ministry with monitoring by the PMO -- showed more than two-thirds of the migrant workers belonged to this sector, according to an official, who asked not to be named. The Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan will start from Telihar village of Bihar’s Khagaria district. The programme will cover India’s 116 districts across Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha. All these districts have received more than 25,000 migrant workers during the lockdown. “We are pooling resources from these 25 projects. There are some works which may get affected by monsoon such as laying of roads. But we want to front load the money allotted for these for those 116 districts and ensure that all those workers in these districts are given employment,” said Sitharaman.Rural development secretary NN Sinha said that the laying of fibre optics cable, railway works, rurban mission jobs, sanitation works, waste management, poultry, farm ponds and training through Krishi Vogyan Kendras will be given to the migrant workers under the programme.He added that there is no bar for other districts to join the programme if they also have more than 25,000 migrant workers.The 116 districts will also contain 27 Aspirational Districts—India’s poorest areas in socio-economic indices—and the government hopes to cover about two-third of migrant workers, the government communique said. Twelve different ministries or departments-- rural development, panchayati raj, transport, mines, drinking water, environment, railways, petroleum, new & renewable energy, border Roads, telecom and agriculture — will participate in the programme, the release added. “Money has been pooled in together to start the programme. The priority is to provide immediate work for them as we go along; we have to see how it goes and if some people would like to stay or go back,” Sitharaman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/50-000-cr-public-works-on-the-cards-for-generating-jobs/story-BAmzE0l9VJMQmU8oRNTw7K.html
20-06-2020||India||This young rapper says being poor doesn’t mean you give up dreaming||One interesting consequence of Covid-19 is the birth of quarantine celebrities reaching out to us through their phones and computers. They talk about the lockdown life in a lighthearted way to cheer us up.One such celebrity is Vikas Bhagel. “Bahar na niklo, kyunki yeh gunah hoga, jo halke mein le rahe, unka haal toh suna hoga!,” he tells you in his viral rap video. This Delhi boy is a driver’s son who had no means to produce the video. With the help of his friends, he could shoot and edit it. If you can dream it, you can make it happen, even in the most adverse circumstances, he tells us.Vikas emphasises on the guidelines to follow to protect oneself against the virus in his video. He also brings up the plight of migrant workers and celebrates the unsung corona warriors such as doctors and nurses.The 21-year-old journalism student is a keen observer and wants to do his bit for the society. “Even if people forget about Covid-19, I hope this rap remind them about the lessons we learnt, the most important one being compassion,” he says. Vikas recorded this video at Loyal Studio, in Kondli in east Delhi. “We all have different ways of expressing ourselves. Some pick up the brush while some put their thoughts into lyrics. With some creativity, we can at least make a crisis bearable if we can’t immediately overcome it,” says the young rapper.Vikas bought a new Bluetooth speaker to make his parents listen to his rap. He says, “We didn’t have the resources to produce this video. I really didn’t know how to do it. But then God made it happen. The reaction of my parents was priceless,” he says.Vikas’ story is about will and determination. He says, “Poverty can be no excuse to give up dreaming. With hard work and a never-say-die attitude, you can achieve any goal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/this-young-rapper-says-being-poor-doesn-t-mean-you-give-up-dreaming/story-HXBwzZp5aNANlf9AHwaTHK.html
20-06-2020||India||Govt reviews use of HCQ and antibiotic combo in treating coronavirus cases||The Union health ministry is reviewing use of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), in combination with antibiotic azithromycin, for treating coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on patients in India, and is likely to come up with revised clinical management guidelines for this soon.According to people familiar with the matter in the health ministry, HCQ is likely to remain as a part of the treatment protocol but azithromycin could be dropped; instead a different combination of medicines that have been allowed for restricted use by the central drugs controller might be tried.“Health ministry has been reviewing the evidence in favour and against HCQ from all over the world. In the recent group of ministers’ meeting also ICMR presented its views on the medicines currently having shown promise in Covid treatment, including remdesivir and favipiravir. HCQ most likely is going to be continued for use but with probably a different combination. Ministry is looking into it and should soon take a call,” added one ministry official, who asked not to be identified. According to the health ministry’s current clinical management protocol for Covid, which was revised on March 31, HCQ in combination with azithromycin can be used for patients with severe disease and requiring intensive care unit (ICU) management. The recommended dosage for HCQ is 400mg twice a day for 1 day, followed by 200mg twice a day for 4 days, and for azithromycin the ministry has recommended 500 mg once a day for 5 days.The combination, however, is not recommended for children under the age of 12 years, pregnant and lactating women.“Since there was no other therapeutic option available after combination of antivirals originally in use for HIV/AIDS lopinavir–ritonavir was discontinued for use among Covid patients in March, this combination of HCQ and azithromycin is being given to severely ill patients currently in hospitals across the country on experimental basis. As other medicines have now shown promise against the virus it makes sense to review the evidence and revise the treatment protocol,” added the official.The jury is still out on HCQ. One international study says it doesn’t serve as a therapeutic or as a prophylactic after exposure to the infection. However, a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research suggests that it works as a prophylaxis pre-exposure. An expert working with the government says, “In situations like an outbreak, when you don’t have the luxury of conducting randomized clinical trials for paucity of time, you recommend a medicine after looking at whatever data is available globally. However, if a medicine is recommended then as per protocol, you need stronger evidence against it to withdraw its use. As of now the evidence is weak, and HCQ because of its safety and efficacy track record is our best bet that can be easily given even at grassroots level in primary health centres.”Doctors treating Covid patients afree that more data is required to reach a definite conclusion.“We need more research on HCQ to be able to tell conclusively whether it is working or not. Its use is not banned as of now,” said Dr Yatin Mehta, chairman, critical care division, Medanta Hospital, Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-reviews-use-of-hcq-and-antibiotic-combo-in-covid-cases/story-LfIlmcn2qxiQvX87i7YIIJ.html
20-06-2020||Editorials||Providing work to migrants | HT Editorial||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will launch the Garib Kalyan Rojgar Abhiyaan (GKRA), a mission-mode scheme designed to help migrant labourers, on Saturday. The massive public work scheme — details of which were first reported in this newspaper — is worth Rs 50,000 crore and aims to provide job opportunities to returnee migrant workers, in 116 districts of key migrant-originating states (Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha) for 125 days; merge 25 existing State-run programmes; and create durable infrastructure. The decision to go for construction-focused employment was taken after a skill mapping of migrants showed that more than two-thirds worked in this sector.The lockdown led to an unprecedented humanitarian crisis, with millions of workers and their families frantically trying to return from their host states, predominantly in west and south India and key urban centres such as Delhi and Mumbai, to their villages in states in the north and east. In May, the Centre hiked the allocation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) by Rs 40,000 crore, taking the total allocation under the scheme to Rs 1,01,500 crore. But it was clear that MGNREGS was not enough, and the Centre would have to come out with another comprehensive scheme to tackle the crisis. GKRA, if implemented properly, can provide relief to the migrants, many of them landless, without savings and dependent on informal rural financial ecosystems, to sustain themselves and their families for the next few months.The movement of workers will also have a major impact on labour markets. Industry is feeling the pinch of labour shortage. But getting back migrant workers will not be easy because the experience of the coronavirus pandemic, the lack of a social security net in the host states, and the absence of support at a critical time has broken the trust between workers and their employers, and between workers and the State. It is critical to build back that trust, and to do so the State must build a register of migrants; fast track the one nation, one ration card scheme; ensure proper housing, sanitation and medical facilities; invest in their skilling; and ensure that labour laws spur industrial growth but also provide basic protection to workers. Without these steps, the migrant workers crisis will continue to fester, and have a debilitating effect on the economy, State resources, and the lives of people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/providing-work-to-migrants/story-Jasb8E4ptkkN2XA8hzWLMN.html
