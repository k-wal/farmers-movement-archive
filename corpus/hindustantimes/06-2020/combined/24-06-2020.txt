24-06-2020||News||India needs a new rural-centric development model | Opinion||Migration has accelerated exponentially over the last decade in India. Current estimates of the total number of migrant workers range from 72 million to 110 million. India has the second-largest migrant worker population in the world, second only to China. One in four workers in India is essentially a migrant. The lack of authentic data on their numbers, their living and working conditions and perpetual uncertainty in their livelihood prospects have been brought in to sharp focus with the coronavirus pandemic. Despite the best effort of both the central and state governments, the mass movement of nearly 10 million migrant workers has brought into sharp relief the urgent need to shift to a new paradigm of economic development and urbanisation in which migration under economic distress or due to the lack of amenities is brought down. This can be done if we can convert the Covid-19 crisis into an opportunity to rethink and reimagine our development model. Fortunately for us, an alternative model that minimises migration is available in the works of Mahatma Gandhi, the late president APJ Abdul Kalam and social activist and Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) ideologue Nanaji Deshmukh. The aspiration for self-reliant development at the village level began with the Gandhian model of swaraj. From the time of his return from South Africa, Gandhi immersed himself in village movements in Champaran (1917), Sevagram (1920) and Wardha (1938). He visualised a comprehensive programme of constructive work, which included economic self-reliance, social equality and a decentralised political system at the village level. For Gandhi, the model of self-reliant villages was the basis of a free democracy. He declared, “My idea of village swaraj is that it is a complete republic, independent of its neighbours for its own vital wants, and yet interdependent for many others in which dependence is a necessity.” His was not a model of a closed economy and a village economy perpetuating itself at the lower levels of income, but one in which local populations could be employed locally but with rising incomes and higher productivity. It is not well known that in his quest for technological improvement, Gandhi had put out an advertisement for a better version of the charkha in British and Indian newspapers in 1929, and even offered a handsome reward of Rs 1 lakh for it (about ~2.5 crore today). Kalam, the missile man, had his own model called Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas (PURA). His vision was to develop rural India through a cluster development system where 50-100 villages with common competencies and/or mutual markets could be horizontally or vertically integrated as PURA complexes. These villages would be linked through “four connectivities” — physical, electronic, knowledge and economic. The goal was to provide income and quality of life opportunities to all within PURA complex. While some rural-rural migration would be acceptable, rural to urban migration would be minimised. He envisioned 7,000 PURA complexes at the cost of Rs 130 crore per unit built through public-private partnerships. Deshmukh called for self-reliant villages based on a model of integral humanism where harmony was also a pivotal force. In his work across 500 villages in India, especially in the Chitrakoot area, the successful implementation of the model called not just for zero unemployment and no one below the poverty line, but also zero internal legal disputes and no widow being denied remarriage. In Deshmukh’s model, the collective social consciousness that promoted collective well-being was considered to be a cornerstone to next-generation rural development. Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi implemented the model of rurban development when he was chief minister of Gujarat. This was sought to be replicated at the pan-India level through the launch of the Shyama Prasad Mukherji Rurban Mission in 2014. The model follows a cluster development design to create social, health, education and economic infrastructure across villages. In order to make 650,000-plus villages and 800 million citizens self-reliant, technology will have to play a critical role. We need to create a rural knowledge platform through active collaboration between the public and private sector. This will provide the expertise to take cutting edge technology deeper into villages and generate employment. Today, the Internet and artificial intelligence are being used extensively around the world to facilitate sustainable agriculture. Large-scale and real-time data collected from farming practices and collated with global price and production numbers can be used to offer more profitable choices to our farmers. In a survey of urban migrant workers, 84% of them reported that their primary source of livelihood in their villages was casual work. Only 11% stated that agriculture was their primary source of income. This indicates that there is a need to create jobs in rural areas far beyond just augmentation of agriculture. In fact, agriculture itself will shed jobs with the addition of technology. To finance this ambitious re-engineering of our development model, Atmanirbhar Village bonds could be issued to raise resources. Part of the mandated priority sector lending by scheduled commercial banks could be used to finance these bonds. We need to prioritise self-reliant village projects to be funded from such lending. We need to create a fresh curriculum in engineering, medical colleges and business schools to train the workforce to operate in villages. The capacity of India’s youth to innovate needs to be unleashed in villages. India needs to build the nation, village upwards and not city downwards. We need to eliminate the division between Bharat and India. This can be achieved bringing Gandhi’s and Kalam’s ideas of developing a rurban India to the centre of the development model.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/india-needs-a-new-rural-centric-development-model/story-EqdadctTIqNYlQgG2uazaL.html
24-06-2020||News||New Zealand – India: People’s politicians in one, protected politicians in the other||A recent news item described an interesting anecdote about New Zealand’s popular Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern. Ardern accompanied by her companion had walked into their local cafe for some brunch. However, due to the strict lockdown laws imposed by her own government, the cafe management refused her entry and turned her away. They had exceeded the number of guests allowed inside at one time in accordance with social distancing norms. Fortunately, the situation was quickly saved when a customer finished his meal and left. Ardern and her companion were recalled and served their brunch.This episode reminded me of my own memories of New Zealand when I had a similar experience of that country’s political and social culture many years ago. In 1975, I had just finished my studies at the Post-Graduate school of Journalism at University of Canterbury in Christchurch and moved to Wellington. I began work at the New Zealand Broadcasting Corporation (NZBC). Like elsewhere in the world, there was a local pub called the Lambton Nook, which was a popular watering hole for journalists. It was located at Lambton Quay, just across the road from the Parliament, popularly known as the Beehive as its circular shape resembled a hive.One fine evening, my friend and senior journalist colleague, Vernon Wright and I were on our way to the pub. As we crossed the Beehive, we encountered a gentleman in a black suit, carrying a black briefcase, stepping out. There were three or four similarly attired people walking behind him. As we neared this gentleman, we got into the typical “sidewalk dance”, where we move left and the other guy moves left, and then we move right, which he also mirrors. After a couple of these manoeuvres, my friend Vernon put a hand firmly on the man’s shoulder and commanded in a typical Kiwi manner: “Why don’t you bloody stand still, mate”, which he did.As we walked past him, I said to Vernon, “This person seemed familiar, I have seen him somewhere”. Vernon replied, “Well, you should have, because his photograph appears in the papers every day.” It was New Zealand’s Prime Minister, Bill Rowlings!I returned to India in January 1977 to start my career as a journalist, became the editor of a tabloid newspaper and had drifted into politics by 1980. I was elected the UP Legislative Council in 1986, to the Lok Sabha from Agra in 1989, and later inducted in the Union Council of Ministers as deputy minister for railways.As a new minister, I received a confidential “for your eyes only” kind of note from the cabinet secretary advising me on the protocols to be followed while dealing with confidential matters and files. It ended with the line “While leaving his residence or office, the Minister must be accompanied by his personal security officer (PSO)”.Being young and a little brash, I wrote back that I did not believe in this “gun culture” and being a Gandhian would not have an armed gentleman following me around.A few days later, then Prime Minister VP Singh spotted me in the corridor as he was walking to his office in Parliament and called me over. “What is all this about the PSO?”, he asked. I said I don’t need one. Aware of his fondness for me, I had a relationship with him where I could pompously philosophise. “The most protected person in the world was felled by a bullet, President John F Kennedy, and the one person nobody ever thought would be killed by a bullet was Mahatma Gandhi. So if the bullet has your name on it, it would find you! I don’t need security”, I told the Prime Minister of India. He began laughing and said: ”George ke sache chelo ho. But stop this childishness, you are no longer merely Ajay Singh, you are a member of the Council of Ministers, there is a responsibility that goes with it.” That very afternoon, a personal security officer was assigned to me.VP Singh was referring to George Fernandes, who had been my close friend and senior ministerial colleague. His official residence was an open house with people walking in and out. From Burmese pro-democracy students, Tibetan exiles to political workers from Bihar, people were all over his house, some staying over for days. He didn’t believe in “”security” either.In the post-Indira Gandhi assassination scenario, security became a serious issue for politicians. This soon degenerated into a status symbol for politicians. Various categories of security, levels of “threat perception”, and types of security from the elite black cat commandos to the lowly PSOs began to proliferate. Security is demanded and provided to the lowest of elected representatives in the political order.A close political aide of mine was elected to the UP Legislative Council. His very first move was to secure a PSO named Yadav. There certainly was no security involved; Yadav’s job was to follow him around, a status symbol publicly announcing the MLC’s new VIP status. In those days I found it amusing to observe Yadav on duty, helping the MLC’s wife’s vegetable shopping or going out late at night to fetch cigarettes for us.I was, however, surprised during a visit to my ancestral village, some 30 kms from Agra, off the highway to Fatehpur Sikri. The village hosts an ancient Dauji Temple where for centuries a big mela takes place on the day after Holi. On this particular occasion, local body elections just had taken place and new village pradhans elected. As I settled down among the elders, I noticed the pradhan from a neighbouring village. I knew him, a dissolute young fellow from an influential family, well known for his intense relationship with Lord Bacchus and the poppy flower. I notice a uniformed UP policeman with a rifle slung casually on his shoulders, standing behind him. He was busy rubbing his left palm with his right thumb preparing his wad of chewing tobacco.Pointing to him, I asked the young pradhan, “Who is this?” Pulling himself up, he replied; “It’s for security, Bhaiyaji.” My response amused the gathering immensely: “You must be joking. Who would want to kill you, a job you are doing well enough yourself. But then I suppose you need security from your own village as I hear rumours about you.”I was reminded of this incident the other day when I came across a joke doing the rounds on social media. A man asks his friend: “Prime ministers, royalty and senior leaders in foreign countries are contracting Covid-19, how is it that no prominent Indian politician has been infected so far?” His friend replies: “Because Indian netas have been practising social distancing for many years and are well protected from the people.” I thought it was very apt!Ajay Singh was a journalist and politician. He served as minister of state for railways in the VP Singh government. He wrote this piece nine days before he passed away on June 9||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/new-zealand-india-people-s-politicians-in-one-protected-politicians-in-the-other/story-b9YSxeKoLZ8v7Plb1RJypO.html

24-06-2020||City||Noida starts buying land from farmers to make land bank||NOIDA: The Noida authority on Wednesday started the process to buy land from farmers in order to prepare it for industrial use.Officials from the authority’s land department on Wednesday met with farmers and also distributed application forms which are to be filled before the land is bought in Mohiyapur village. As per process, the authority can either acquire land from farmers by implementing the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013 or buy the same directly via registry.“We buy land from farmers at a rate of Rs 5,000 per square metre directly as this method consumes less time, as compared to the land act of 2013. Once the registry is done and the authority pays the total cost of the land, we will take possession and start development of roads, sewers, parks and other basic facilities, before allotting the same for industrial usage,” said a Noida authority official, requesting anonymity.The authority needs to buy land from Gulawali, Dallupura, Mohiyapur, Jhatta villages, among others, in order to develop industrial areas in sectors 151, 156, 157, 158, 159 and others located along the Noida-Greater Noida Expressway.“The planning for the next land bank is in progress and some unpurchased (from farmers) industrial, institutional land of around 200 acres is lying unplanned in different sectors. We will come up with a new industrial plot scheme once this land bank is ready,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.This comes after the UP government had asked the authority to ready industrial land to be allotted to private firms that shall set up industrial units to boost industrial growth in this region and create jobs.“Since the authority has included our land in their master plan, we have no option but to sell to them for development,” said Umesh Kumar, a farmer from Dullupura village.Noida is spread on 20,000 hectares of land surrounded by Yamuna and Hindon Rivers. It has around 16,000 hectares of urbanized area. Its land is divided into 47% residential and 13% industrial land, while the rest is developed for other usages that include commercial, institutional, green and others. It is left with at least 300 hectares of land which is earmarked for industrial usage but which is yet to be acquired from farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-starts-buying-land-from-farmers-to-make-land-bank/story-grrVnUG3c4sOfEeG9JLkVI.html
24-06-2020||Noida||ICMR officials give training to health workers of Meerut division ahead of massive antigen tests||Ahead of starting antigen based Covid-19 testing in Gautam Budh Nagar, Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) trained health department officials and laboratory technicians in Noida on the new testing strategy.The Council on Tuesday expanded the testing norms, advising that all hospitals, offices and public sector units be enabled to conduct rapid antibody tests, and recommending the deployment of rapid antigen tests in all containment zones, and hospitals and private labs across the state.With 15,000 rapid antigen test kits in their kitty, the district administration has constituted 10 teams to identify high risk groups, influenza like illness symptoms (ILI) and co-morbidities. They have also been told to conduct massive special testing drives, particularly in the containment zones.District magistrate Suhas LY said that as per the ICMR guidelines, it is now recommended to use Standard Q Covid-19 Argentum detection test as a point of care diagnostic assay. “Since containment zones are high-risk areas, it will help there in testing in the containment zones as well as hospitals in combination with the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test. All the 10 teams have been asked to identify the high-risk areas and conduct as much tests as possible to identify maximum number of Covid-19 positive cases. These dedicated teams will help in early tracking, containment and reduction of mortality rate,” he said. He further said that all the health officials have been asked to focus to test, track and treat Covid-19 patients. “Since it is imperative to explore the existing antigen-based assays as point-of-care tests for early detection of Coronavirus, the test will prove as a boon as it is very specific with moderate sensitivity,” he said.Meanwhile, with 98 new Covid-19 positive cases on Wednesday in the last 24 hours, the overall count of the district has now gone to 1,673 cases.GB Nagar district chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that as many as 47 positive patients were cured and discharged from different hospitals by Wednesday. “So far, altogether 996 patients have been cured and discharged from different facilities in GB Nagar. Besides, 19 Covid-19 positive patients have lost their lives in the district. As a result, the district now has 654 active cases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/icmr-officials-give-training-to-health-workers-of-meerut-division-ahead-of-massive-antigen-tests/story-IrJ1J8K4YhbEycxlrpMH1O.html

Ghaziabad is one of the 11 sensitive districts, according to the Uttar Pradesh government, that has seen a spike in Covid-19 cases ever since the Unlock 1.0 was announced from June 8. “Like in Delhi, there has been demand from residents for paid Covid-19 treatment facilities. We have authorised the five hospitals. In future, we plan to expand the facility to more hospitals,” said Gupta.Dr. Sharad Agrawal, the CEO of Le Crest Hospital said the hospital has dedicated 100 of its 250 beds for Covid-19 treatment.“We started operations on Tuesday and the first Covid patient was admitted on Wednesday.

24-06-2020||Gurugram||Monsoon rains may hit Gurugram in next 24 hours||While the national capital received the monsoon’s first rain on Wednesday, Gurugram remained dry. According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), the city is likely to receive rainfall in the next 24-48 hours as the southwest monsoon advances further into Haryana.The maximum temperature on Wednesday was at 34.5 degrees Celsius, which was lower by roughly three degrees from Tuesday’s 37 degrees Celsius. The minimum temperature on Wednesday was recorded 28 degrees.According to the IMD’s weekly forecast, temperature is expected to drop by about two degrees and settle around 33 degrees Celsius on Thursday with the possibility of rain. As per the IMD’s Palam observatory, which is the closest manual weather observatory to Gurugram, moderate rainfall may be expected on Thursday. Cloudy skies with spells of thundershowers have also been predicted by the weather department for Thursday. The minimum temperature is expected to settle at 28 degrees Celsius on Thursday.While Delhi had received rains on Wednesday, the arrival of the season is likely to be declared officially on Thursday as the met department is waiting to see how much it rains over 24 hours, said Kuldeep Srivastava, head of the IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Delhi. He added that with further advancement of southwest monsoon in Haryana, conditions were fertile for monsoon rains in Gurugram and other cities across the national capital region.Air quality in the city was ‘satisfactory’ on Wednesday for the second consecutive day, recording 77 on the Central Pollution Control Board’s air quality index (AQI) bulletin. This was an improvement from the previous day’s recording of 88 in the ‘satisfactory’ category. The improvement was attributed largely to an increase in wind speed.

The hospital is almost 30 kms away from the city limits and the district has decided to streamline its ambulance services to transport such patients to the centre.The officials said that they have 14 government ambulances, including two advanced life-support ambulances, deployed to transport Covid-19 positive patients to hospitals, and back home after they are discharged.“Since the L-1 hospital at Niwari is about 30km from the city limits, we have planned that route chart of ambulances will be chalked out. For instance, if we have patients in areas like Indirapuram, Vaishali, and Vasundhara, etc they can be combined in an ambulance as per a route chart. This is being done in order so that no patient has to wait at home for long,” said Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate.According to officials, they have also roped in about 20 private ambulances for the purpose too and will also rope in private mini buses.“The buses will be dedicated for ferrying Covid-19 patients to our hospitals. Bus staff will be given protective equipment. We have also started sending letters to Covid-19 patients at our L-1, L-2 (moderate cases) and L-3 (critical) facilities to motivate them. We want to make them feel that administration and health care staff is working to treat them and happily see them off,” Pandey added.The officials have shutdown the 60-bedded L-1 hospital at Nandgram and are now planning to open another facility at IMS College, Dasna. The other L-1 facility is the 76-bedded ESIC Hospital, Sahibabad.“The IMS facility will be 400-bedded facility and we have started preparations. We also inspected one other facility at Modinagar but it had certain issues. So, we have almost dropped plans for coming up with L1 facility at Modinagar and will instead take over the facility at IMS College, Dasna,” said Dr. NK Gupta, chief medical officer. “We generally take away patients to hospitals within 24 hours of the test results. Since the hospital at Niwari is far, we are roping in more ambulances and seeing to it that transportation of patients is not delayed.”Ten lab technicians and one pathologist were also trained in the use of rapid antigen kits which will be used for speedy detection of Covid-19 status of patients.“We have received 10,000 antigen kits. We will now use it to test people in different areas as per a plan which will be chalked out by the district administration,” CMO said.The district magistrate on Wednesday also acquired the Shambhu Dayal Inter College, near Navyug Market, as a temporary jail. Another temporary jail at Adhyatmik Nagar was already acquired to house foreigners who had come to attend religious congregations and tested positive for Covid-19.“The temporary jail at the inter college will be used for housing inmates who test positive for Covid-19. They will be admitted here in case they are positive,” Pandey said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-covid-hospital-out-of-city-limits-officials-rope-in-more-ambulances/story-aMTkjvQALn3EKyb2GpqPHO.html

24-06-2020||Gurugram||Food and Drug Authority officials seize disinfectant sprays worth ₹18 lakh||The Food and Drug Authority (FDA) seized a huge consignment of disinfectant sprays — estimated to be worth over Rs 18 lakh — from an unlicensed manufacturer in Sector 35 on Tuesday evening. The spray was allegedly being manufactured illegally as ‘ayurvedic proprietary medicine’ without a valid drug licence. Most of the stock seized was to be delivered in daily need stores across the city, said FDA officials.According to the officials, the disinfectant sprays were being manufactured by the company in Sector 35 that makes and supplies perfumes and deodorants. They had started manufacturing such sprays during the lockdown without any proper license. The officials also found the conditions under which the factory was operating was highly unhygienic.Amandeep Chauhan, drug control officer, said that a team of officials from the drug control and Ayush (ayurveda, yoga, unani, siddha and homeopath) department was formed after receiving information on Tuesday afternoon. “We had received a tip-off, following which we collected samples of disinfectant sprays from a store in DLF Phase 4 on Tuesday. When we checked the packaging, we found that the manufacturer had pasted stickers mentioning ‘as directed by a doctor’ and labelled it as an ayurvedic proprietary medicine. These spray bottles were selling for Rs 349,” he said.Officials said they seized 334 packed boxes of disinfectant spray from the factory. The officials said that when they asked the manufacturer to provide a valid drugs manufacturing license , he said he didn’t have one and said that he manufactured his products under ayurvedic manufacturing license but permission was for human use not as surface disinfectant. “Surface disinfectants cannot be manufactured under ayurvedic manufacturing licence hence it is a violation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. A search was carried out in the factory and we found various brands of surface disinfectants also. The complete inventory was seized,” said Chauhan.Officials said surface disinfectants cannot be manufactured under Ayush license but only as drugs in compliance of section 3 of Drugs and Cosmetics Act. Dr Naresh of Ayush checked the manufacturer’s permission on the spot and said that it was not for disinfectant sprays.Officials said a complaint would be filed before the chief judicial magistrate (CJM) after investigations. The department had also lodged an FIR against a shopkeeper in DLF Phase-I on Monday for overcharging for hand sanitisers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/food-and-drug-authority-officials-seize-disinfectant-sprays-worth-18-lakh/story-yaoki7tLym1pN2zF6ULQbI.html

Most of them are away since the college went on a break from March 15. Students are scattered across the country and will start reporting to the civil surgeon in a day or two,” said Lamba.The college has also appointed a nodal officer to coordinate between the students and the health department. Lamba said that the students will be trained by a team deputed by the civil surgeon before they are given any assignment. He said that details regarding the accommodation of students were yet to be finalised. “Whether students will be accommodated within the college hostel or at alternative places will be discussed in the coming days. Arrangements are being made ,” said Lamba. The college is also coordinating with the district administration regarding the arrangement of conveyance for students.Lamba said that students had mixed response to the development, but all of them will be compulsorily required to report for their assignment as the government directive was applicable to all. “Everyone needs to comply with the government order. If someone is sick or unable to join due to some serious reason, we can take a decision as per the situation then. No exceptions are to be made otherwise,” he said.He added that the college had not deployed paramedical staff to the administration so far but if requested by the administration, the college was also prepared to deploy paramedics and final year nursing students, OT technicians in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/final-year-mbbs-students-to-join-fight-against-covid-19-soon/story-M1hJC0NRZm6hyomiMpX6cM.html

According to a statement issued by Medeor, the patient was in coma and tested positive for Covid-19 while he was admitted.Doctors say that he had Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), a rare neurological disorder triggered due to Covid-19. It is mostly found in children but it can affect people of any age. ADEM is the result of an immune reaction to an infection in the body. The immune system instead of fighting the infection, causes inflammation in the brain and spinal cord. It leads to various neurological symptoms like headache, fever, unsteadiness, weakness in arms or legs, confusion or convulsions.Dr Ashish Gupta, director, critical care Medicine, Medeor, said, “This is the first case of ADEM which our specialised team of doctors and medical staff have successfully treated for Covid. Being a rare disease, there have been hardly any reported cases of Covid-19 related ADEM, as per our present knowledge.”The patient was treated for almost 25 days in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). He showed neurological recovery, regained consciousness, and finally tested negative for Covid-19 infection. The patient was discharged on June 11. The hospital has so far treated more than 200 Covid-19 patients who required critical care and ventilator support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/covid-patient-with-rare-neurological-complication-recovers/story-6kp5l1mtenlKRHns7uc9qN.html
24-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram municipality to start survey for taking over several private colonies||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) is likely to conduct a civic deficiency assessment survey in August in several privately developed colonies that it intends to take over from private developers, officials said on Wednesday.MCG officials said that they held a meeting in this regard with the department of town and country planning (DTCP) at the civic body’s sector 34 office on Tuesday. The DTCP has been asked to submit building plans for six privately developed colonies— Ardee City, Malibu Towne, Vipul World, Uppal Southend, Rosewood City, Mayfield Gardens- within the next 15 days — which the developers had submitted in the 1990s and early 2000s to establish these colonies.“We will be using the building plans as a reference to assess if the builders have completed all the civic amenities mentioned in the plans during the civic deficiency assessment survey. In addition, the survey will also be assessing the existing infrastructure flaws in these colonies. Based on the deficiency survey report, the MCG will prepare estimates needed to add or fix amenities for each colony,” said a senior MCG official in the planning branch of the MCG who attended Tuesday’s meeting.All six colonies are situated in close proximity to Sohna Road. “The MCG took over six privately developed colonies last year. This time too, the process followed will be similar. Based on the service estimates in the deficiency assessment survey, the MCG will ask the developer to either pay the amount to us for getting the amenities fixed and hand over their respective colonies or they can finish the work themselves and then hand it over to us,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.MCG officials said that with the developer of Ardee City not obtaining a completion certificate, the colony is likely to be removed from the final list of colonies that MCG wants to take over. A point also supported by the developer.“Ardee City does not have a completion certificate which is a mandatory clause for initiating the taking over process,” said Anil Haseeja, vice president, Ardee Infrastructure Private Limited.The MCG had taken over Sushant Lok 1, Palam Vihar, Suncity, Nirvana, South City 1 and 2 in March last year. The takeover of DLF Phases 1-2-3 is still in process as the developer there had decided to fix the existing civic deficiencies themselves. Barring Suncity, the developers of the remaining colonies had paid the MCG to fix deficiencies and handed over their respective colonies.Last year in September, MCG had sent a recommendation to the state government for allowing them to take over Ardee City and Malibu Towne. Two months later, the MCG wrote to the directorate of town and country planning in Chandigarh seeking details such as building plans, the total number of plots, status of completion certificate, year of construction, layout of stormwater, water and sewerage lines, parks, and community centres for all the six colonies.An agenda for taking over- Malibu Towne, Vipul World, Uppal Southend, Rosewood City, Mayfield Gardens- was also approved during a MCG house meeting in February. The agenda though did not include Ardee City but mentioned Sushant Lok 2-3 instead.At that time, the town planning branch of MCG had informed its councillors and officials that they will be approaching DTCP for procuring building plans for all seven colonies. Officials said due to the Covid-19 outbreak, the matter was pushed back by another four months.MCG officials said that they are still exploring the possibility of taking over of Sushant Lok 2-3. However, officials privy to the matter said that they will initiate its formalities only after the process for taking over these five or six colonies is over.RS Batth, district town planner did not respond for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-municipality-to-start-survey-for-taking-over-several-private-colonies/story-U5fQCarORg6RvglATY3MuJ.html

They suggested that for patients who are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms, consultations should be provided over phone. “Rather than making people visit a Covid care centre, district authorities can do so by visiting their homes or over telephone. This will also help reduce the burden on the centres as well,” said Dr Ruby Makhija, a practising ophthalmologist and secretary, Navjeevan Vihar RWA, Malviya Nagar.Residents said the order has caused confusion among people. They said the district authorities must also circulate a list of facilities where people in home isolation can go if they need more care.Sandeep Bali, president, Mehrauli RWA, said the Covid care centres are expected to be crowded since all positive patients would have to visit for an assessment. “Asymptomatic patients will be at risk of exposure to higher viral load as well as of contracting other non-covid communicable diseases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rwas-write-to-l-g-urge-him-to-re-examine-new-home-isolation-rules/story-4Ny50BmTgJmc1Yl20FfTbI.html

The parents claimed that school authorities told them their wards’ names would be struck off the rolls if they failed to pay. After the protest continued for two hours, police intervened and asked the principal to meet the parents. Seven representatives of the parents met the principal and who told them to visit the school on Thursday to meet members of the management.A parent, Rahul Kumar, said, “The parents were forced to protest due to financial constraints caused by the Covid-19 induced lockdown.

According to civic body officials, different committees have been set up at the hospital to source equipment, including personal protective equipment (PPE), oxygen support and ventilators. Besides, separate ICU beds and isolation wards are to be readied for Covid-positive and suspected cases.The government had on June 14 announced the hospital, the largest run by the north municipal corporation, as a dedicated facility for Covid care. It was supposed to start admitting Covid patients from June 16. “ Around 200 patients admitted here have been discharged or referred to other non-Covid facilities. The hospital has stopped admitting non-Covid patients as it has to be vacated and sanitised before it can start working as a Covid-only facility. The emergency and OPD services are open but after analysing emergency cases, we are sending them to other hospitals,” said a senior corporation official, speaking on the condition of anonymity.The official said orders have been placed for major requirement. “Initially, 150 beds will be converted into Covid beds. More beds will be added later. It will take a few days more before we are ready to start a full-fledged Covid treatment facility,” the official said. At present, the flu clinic is functional and Covid-19 sampling is being done. On an average, 50-80 samples are being collected every day since the clinic started operating on June 16 .“If there are Covid positive patients requiring hospital care, we refer them to other Covid facilities till the time we are ready to admit such patients,” the official said.Dr Anu Kapur, the hospital’s medical superintendent, said, “We are busy in preparations. As soon as the logistics are in place, we will start Covid-19 admissions.”Meanwhile, the resident doctors association has written to the administration regarding installation of air-conditioning in the wards as it would be difficult for them to attend patients wearing PPE kits all day. They also want proper accommodation as the hostel rooms do not have separate toilets and bathrooms.“Our salaries are still due for two months. We have written to the administration regarding the issue as well as about concerns when the hospital turns into a complete Covid facility. At least 40-50 doctors will be on duty in the Covid wards and proper accommodation is required for their own safety,” said Dr Abhimanyu Sardana, a senior resident and president, RDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/hindu-rao-hospital-still-not-prepared-to-be-a-designated-covid-facility/story-W6n4uZZDINXZhMiRYgpwrJ.html

The court stated that there is a delay of four months in moving the application.Farooq is the principal of Rajdhani school in North East Delhi. Metropolitan Magistrate Richa Parihar said that the city police are seeking custody in the case after a delay of four months in moving the application since the case was registered soon after the incident on February 24.

The high court was told about the arrest while hearing a plea by the city police seeking cancellation of bail in FIR no-134/2020 following which the court had stayed the release of Faisal. Faisal has been accused of orchestrating the riots outside his school. A Delhi court had on Saturday granted bail to the Farooq stating that the CCTV footage did not show his presence at the place of the incident where the riots had broken out. But on Monday, police had approached the high court against the lower court’s decision to release him on bail. On Wednesday, advocates RK Kocchar and Gaurav Kocchar, told the court that the contents of both the FIRs are the same and his client has already been investigated in this case. The counsels submitted that the FIR in the present case was registered with a malafide intention against the accused on the same facts.Opposing the police custody, he also said that the accused was formally arrested again in the present case (FIR-73) on June 22 only to defeat the purpose of bail granted to accused in FIR number –134 on Saturday.Seeking custody, the Investigating Officer (IO), told the court that the co-accused had to be arrested and further investigation is pending. He said that 76 FIRs have been registered with respect to the violence around the Rajdhani school and this case is different from the one in which Faisal has been granted bail.He also contended that the Farooq had to be taken to several parts of Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Delhi for further investigation.After hearing the contentions, the court agreed with the contentions of Farooq’s counsel and said that the incidents in both the FIRs had taken place on the same date and even the allegations are same. It also said that the accused, Faisal, has been in custody for last four months in connection to the other FIR and even in that case the police had contended that he had to be taken to other states for investigation.“I do not find any justification in moving the present application after a delay of about four months when the facts were within the knowledge of the IO himself from the very first day of the incident and moreover both the cases were simultaneously registered at same police station --Dayalpur,” the court said while refusing police custody. Earlier this month, police had charged 18 people in connection to the riots that broke out at the Rajdhani Public School, while naming its principal, Farooq for hatching a conspiracy to precipitate and aggravate riots, in and around Rajdhani School. His counsel had denied the charges and said that Farooq had infact informed police control room about the riots. Police claimed in the charge sheet that the call detail analysis of Farooque suggested that the he had links with links with prominent members of Popular Front of India, Pinjratod group, Jamia Coordination Committee. The members of these organisations have also been arrested conspiracy behind the riots in north east Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-riots-court-denies-police-custody-for-school-principal/story-BgMITjEijoJcLBljSsbSGI.html

We had invited suggestions from individuals and NGOs about naming the station to signify the essence of the community and honour their spirit. We have plans to employ them and also respect the sentiment,” said Ritu Maheshari CEO of the Noida authority and managing director of NMRC.The authority has given the name ‘rainbow station’ after some people raised the objection to word- ‘SheMan’ used for transgender community.The rainbow colours, especially etched on flags, represent diversity and are also a prominent symbol of pride for the wider Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Queer (LGBTQ) community, which has for long struggled for equal rights. While announcing the move last week, the NMRC MD had cited Census 2011 figures to state that there are 4.9 lakh transgenders in India out of which 30,000 to 35,000 are staying in Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR).Earlier in 2017, the Kochi Metro Rail Limited in Kerala had taken a similar step by employing 23 transgenders, breaking a new ground in gender justice.The NMRC started operations on this 29.707km Noida-Greater Noida Metro Link on January 26, 2019. The services on Metro Link are disrupted since March 25, 2020 after nationwide lockdown was announced to prevent the spread of Covid 19 pandemic.“We will start the operations on Aqua Line as soon as we get the nod from the government,” said Maheshwari.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-s-sector-50-metro-station-named-rainbow-station-to-honour-transgender-community/story-glAnkVi3xJxDbwVfRrJHgO.html

24-06-2020||Kolkata||Private hospitals neglected comorbid conditions: Mamata Banerjee||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday said that a few more lives could have been saved had the private hospitals given a better treatment to patients with comorbid conditions. The chief minister also announced that the coronavirus lockdown in containment zones in West Bengal, which was supposed to expire on June 30, has been extended till July 31. “We could have saved a few more lives if they were given some better treatment. Private hospitals focused on Covid-19 treatments and neglected the comorbid condition like cardiac problems and kidney problems in Covid patients. As a result some people died. I am sorry to say. The government is sending instruction to the hospitals in this regard,” Banerjee said, after an all-party meeting held at the state secretariat on Wednesday.At least 591 people have died in the state out of which 437 or nearly 74% had comorbid conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease and kidney ailments among others. “When a critical cardiac patient with Covid-19 is coming you should first attend his cardiac problems. Later you can attend his Covid problems,” she added. “The lockdown, with the relaxations that have been earlier announced, will continue till July 31,” Banerjee told media persons, adding that political parties had come up with different suggestions on extending the lockdown. West Bengal had on June 8, relaxed lockdown curbs from June 1 along with other parts of the country. The lockdown now exists primarily in the containment zones with relaxations given to shops, offices, religious institutions and public transport in other places. She said that the state would request the NITI Aayog to formulate a master plan for the the protection and development of the Sunderbans, home to more than four million people and around 100 tigers.“All parties have raised the issue of Sunderbans which is repeatedly being devastated by cyclones. We will request NITI Aayog to send down a team and formulate a master plan and a permanent solution. The help of the World Bank can also be taken,” she added.An all-party committee, with state parliamentary affairs minister Partha Chatterjee has been formed, to look into the relief and restoration work in the aftermath of cyclone Amphan that has affected around 100 million people in the state.“We had given some suggestions to in the meeting. Let the government take actions on those suggestions. It is too early to say whether we are happy with the outcome of the meeting,” said Dilip Ghosh, president of the BJP’s unit in West Bengal. There have been allegations of corruption in the relief work against the ruling party in several villages. Recently irate villagers have staged protests in many cyclone hit areas and government offices have been ransacked. “I have instructed the chief secretary and the district administration that no genuine cyclone-victim should be deprived of the relief. Some of our panchayat leaders and members have been ousted. We won’t tolerate any corruption,” she added.CPIM state secretary Surya Kanta Mishra said: “There are certain gaps which need to be plugged particularly in the health care sector. We have given our suggestions to the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/kolkata/private-hospitals-neglected-comorbid-conditions-mamata-banerjee/story-cxR8oPCIMdSpsrfyXYbcQK.html

Of total 5,972 passengers, 5,011 are international and others domestic. With 5,011 passengers, the Amritsar airport has achieved the third place among all international airports in country.A complete suspension of flights in late March left thousands of foreign nationals and residents stranded across country, including Punjab. The biggest number of UK and Canada residents stranded in India was recorded in Punjab. To repatriate its citizens, their consulates in India arranged special chartered flights operated by leading airline carriers, including the British Airways.Amritsar handled the biggest number of flights from India to London’s Heathrow airport by UK and by Canadian foreign office to Toronto, Vancouver and Montreal to fly back Britons and Canadians. These overseas flights started in April and continued to operate till mid-May.Sameep Singh Gumtala, global convener of the Fly Amritsar initiative, said, “The demand for direct repatriation flights from Amritsar to UK and Canada was raised by stranded passengers with their governments. This proves that majority of the international traffic at Delhi airport from UK and Canada comes from Punjab.”“Punjabi diaspora prefer to travel directly from Punjab instead of Delhi, if more international flights are started from Amritsar. The airport is within three-hour reach from all major cities in Punjab and this distance will be reduced to half after the completion of Delhi-Amritsar-Katra Expressway,” he said.Yogesh Kamra, Fly Amritsar convener and secretary Amritsar Vikas Manch, said the airport has all infrastructures to handle traffic even during extreme crisis situations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/amritsar-int-l-airport-emerges-as-third-busiest-in-india-amid-lockdown/story-gHdhS17Yw6PfqDsCKqOaDO.html

They also urged the Centre to roll back this decision.State Congress president Kuldeep Rathore said that despite the historic reduction in the crude oil prices (most significant since 1991) the present central government continues to hit the consumer by not providing any relief rather, it has increased per litre excise duty on petrol and diesel.Fuel prices have been increasing for the last 17 days. So far, petrol prices have been hiked by ₹8.75 per litre while diesel prices have been increased by ₹10.44 per litre.He said that the Centre’s decision to increase fuel prices during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic is insensitive. “The government should have been more sensitive to the plight of people as they are already in great distress. At such a time when the government is supposed to reduce prices, the increase in excise duty of petrol and diesel is totally unacceptable and must be rolled back immediately,” he added.Earlier a procession of Congress workers sloganeering against price rise, Chinese intrusion into Indian Territory and failure of the Centre to check price hike from Congress Office Rajiv Bhawan Shimla to DC Office via Subzi Mandi and lower Bazar was carried out adhering to social distancing norms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rollback-hike-in-fuel-prices-hp-congress-urges-centre/story-icndUBr0mpYhHkvhWu9s6L.html

Earlier, it was allowed in eight focal points and that too with 33% conversion charges of current value of the plot.PSIEC managing director Sumeet Jaranagal said it was done considering the persistent demand of entrepreneurs and their representative bodies, and impact of Covid-19 pandemic. “Now, the allottees will not need to pay the conversion charges, but subject to the condition that they will adhere to the applicable zoning and building bylaws,” he said.President of Mohali Industries Association Yogesh Sagar said, “It was a long-pending demand of the industrialists. The decision will help small industries economise on their operations and manage their affairs more effectively and efficiently.”In January this year, the PSIEC allowed commercial use of 20% area of the industrial plots.Aug 31 last date for paying enhanced land cost The PSIEC has extended the last date for the payment of enhanced land cost from May 30 to till August 31.

24-06-2020||Chandigarh||Former DEO challenges appointment of Harbir Singh, HC puts UT on notice||The Punjab and Haryana has put the Chandigarh administration on notice on a plea challenging the appointment of Harbir Singh as the district education officer (DEO). Singh will be replacing Alka Mehta, the incumbent, whose appointment is already under challenge before the high court by former DEO Anujit Kaur. The high court bench of justice Daya Chaudhary and justice Meenakshi I Mehta has sought UT’s response by August 17.After the appointment of Mehta as DEO in November 2019 replacing Kaur, the latter had challenged the education department’s orders in the Central Administrative Tribunal (CAT). CAT stayed Mehta’s appointment, which resulted in the matter reaching the high court. The court on January 6 stayed the CAT order and allowed Mehta to continue on the post. However, even as the dispute between the two was still pending in court, Anand was appointed as DEO by the UT administration earlier this month.Now, Kaur in her plea says instead of resolving the matter, the education department has passed a fresh order, which will further complicate the matter. She has argued that Singh has been posted as DEO, though he is at serial number 15 of the gradation list as per departmental seniority list. Kaur feels, being the senior most in the department, she should have been allowed to continue on the post. She wants the department to conduct a regular Departmental Promotion Committee (DPC) and award regular promotion to the post of DEO. She is set to retire in September 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/former-deo-challenges-appointment-of-harbir-singh-hc-puts-ut-on-notice/story-XhpfKVfgEDAHmTfufGSkZP.html
24-06-2020||Noida||Noida Police clocks second-best response time to distress calls in UP||Among 75 districts in Uttar Pradesh, the Gautam Buddh Nagar district has ranked second for two straight months in terms of response time to emergency 112 call, according to official data. Gautam Buddh Nagar police clocked an average time of 8.10 minutes to respond to an emergency in the month of May, behind only Raebareli police which had the best time of 7.49 minutes, the state-level data showed. In the month of April, Gautam Buddh Nagar police’s average response time was exact 8 minutes, behind only Kanpur city police by one second, it showed.Deputy Commissioner of Police (Traffic) Rajesh S, who is also the officer in-charge for 112 service in Gautam Buddh Nagar, said they attended a whopping 53,405 calls. In April and 16,428 in May – the two months when the Covid-19 lockdown was in place – and managed the second best response time in the state. Adjoining Delhi in western UP, Gautam Buddh Nagar is spread over an area of 1,442 sq kms with a large rural area besides the urbane Noida and Greater Noida, officials said. Currently, the district has 65 four-wheeler and 46 two-wheeler police response vehicles (PRVs) which handle emergency calls made on 112, the officials said. All distress calls made on 112 are re-routed to the local PRVs from the Lucknow headquarters and the time duration is calculated from the moment a PRV responds to the situation till it reaches the incident spot, with both times being fed on mobile-data terminals, according to officials. Also, the response time of any district is the average duration of urban and rural time, they said. According to the data, the Gautam Buddh Nagar police clocked an average 8.33 minutes to respond to distress calls in rural areas and 7.12 minutes in urban areas. The same figures for the month of May stood at 8.38 minutes in rural areas and 7.18 minutes in urban areas, the data showed. “Rural time is always difficult because of the terrain and distance,” DCP Rajesh told PTI, adding that their focus is now at reducing the response time in urban areas to 7 minutes. He credited the consistency in the ranking to team work but also stressed that the district police wants to improve not only its timing but also ensure better after-response situation. “My main concern is what happens after handling the distress call. We can always improve upon the timing but our focus is at ensuring that the emergency responders behave well with aggrieved persons. Being ranked second is fine, but my concern is on our personnel being sensitive and empathetic towards the caller,” Rajesh said. He added that the PRV personnel are regularly trained and a monitoring system is in place to analyse their work. He said major portion of the distress calls during the lockdown was for food and dry ration from across the distress, as indicated in the whopping number of emergency calls. The number of such calls came down drastically in May when a dedicated helpline for Covid-19 related issues was started in the district. “There have been occasions when early response by PRV teams have fetched excellent results. In the month of May, a man had called up 112 and said he was going to hang himself, the PRV team reached well in time and saved him. There was another instance when PRV officials helped evacuate a family caught in fire inside their house. This was possible because the people were aware that 112 emergency number would work and it did,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/noida-police-clocks-second-best-response-time-to-distress-calls-in-up/story-2P9RyiJx2PI7ig4TqJahdL.html

This is part of the new Covid-19 response plan prepared by Delhi government health department, as per the recommendations from the Union Health Ministry. The purpose is to boost surveillance of positive cases and improve contact tracing, officials said. As per the orders issued by the Directorate General of Health Services in Delhi on Monday, all the chief district medical officers and surveillance officers of all the districts have received a revised response plan which prescribes use of Aarogya Setu coupled with ITIHAS system for cluster projection.  “As per the recommendation of the committee (headed by NITI Ayog member V K Paul), Aarogya Setu app coupled with ITIHAS system anchored by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, is capable of tracking the movement of the cases and their contacts.

24-06-2020||City||Monsoon’s here but Punjab isn’t rain ready||Flooding and waterlogging during monsoon in Punjab is a tale as old as time. This year, with the state government and district authorities busy tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and as such late to start preparing for the rains, Hindustan Times surveys how prepared major cities of Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Bathinda, Amritsar and Patiala are for the rains scheduled to hit Punjab from Thursday.CASH-STRAPPED JALANDHAR MC YET TO START DRAIN CLEANING DRIVEThe cash-strapped municipal corporation in Jalandhar seems unprepared for the monsoons as the cleaning of sewer and main drains has yet to begin.Sewer pipelines choked with plastic and waste led to flooding in most of the roads and low-lying areas in the city last year.The Congress-ruled MC House, say sources, does not have a plan to tackle waterlogging despite being included in the Centre’s smart city list in September 2016.As no revenues have been generated in the last few months because of the Covid-19 lockdown, the MC deferred plans to buy new machines or install new pipelines to manage storm water drainage.Only drains in the city will be cleaned as of now, but work on that too will begin once contractors manage to get labourers, which is difficult as most of them have left for their home states after the corona outbreak, says a senior MC officer.Lovedeep Singh Nagra, a resident of Shaheed Babu Labh Singh Nagar, says most of the roads in the city have developed potholes due to rain early this month, but no repair has been carried out. As a result, the risk of mishaps has increased.Besides Covid-19, the risk of other disease outbreaks is high as the MC has not started its fogging drive.The MC has managed to cover only 8% area with storm water drainage, while sewage pipes don’t have the capacity to handle the heavy flow of water.Even as the civic body has been using sewage cleaning machines to clear the choked pipes for over a year, waterlogging has been reported.The MC in the last financial year spent about Rs 50 lakh on cleanliness and maintenance of the sewerage and water supply systems in the city.MC commissioner Karnesh Sharma says there are enough cleaning machines and there are plans to hire more for a cleaning drive of the drains and pipelines ahead of the monsoon. – Jatinder MahalAMRITSAR HOPES TO STEER CLEAR OF WATERLOGGINGAmritsar’s sewer lines are being cleaned manually and mechanically at a cost of ₹8 crore, as the municipal corporation gears up to face the monsoon this season.“The city has a 200-km main sewer line that runs through 85 wards. It used to be badly choked and filled beyond capacity, leading to submerging of most parts of the city every year, but this time, our new mechanised sewage cleaning machines will be used to clean the drains,” said mayor Karamjit Singh Rintu.Desilting, which started in every constituency, is expected to be completed before the monsoon begins. The machines will be used at most of the places, “so once cleaned, the drains won’t cause waterlogging at Heritage Street at the Golden Temple,” Rintu said.“Apart from the ₹8 crore sewer line cleaning project, a ₹5.5-crore project to clean the main sewerage drain, Ganda Nullah, in the city had been initiated in October last year and the desilting has been completed,” said Komal Mittal, MC commissioner.Though Mittal said she was confident that there would be no waterlogging in the city, two control rooms would be set up by MC, at Lahori Gate and Company Bagh, to tackle choked drains, where MC employees will work from July to September. “We will advertise the helpline numbers soon,” she said.Urging the MC to be better prepared, Kulwant Singh, social worker, said, “During pre-monsoon rain last year, a portion of Mall Road caved three months after it had been repaired. Waterlogging on Heritage Street, at the city bus stand and in the walled city remains a concern. During the lockdown, the MC should have recarpeted city roads.” Mandeep Kaur NarulaLAND ACQUISITION FOR SULLAGE LINE UNDERWAY IN BATHINDAIt is likely that Bathinda will face a flood-like situation in some pockets of the city this year too. The district does not have a storm water drainage network and sewage lines are being used to drain rainwater.Last year, it was decided that a 12-km sullage line will be installed to drain excess rainwater from Power House Road locality, which is one of the worst-hit areas. However, only 4km of the pipeline has been laid as land acquisition for the remaining area is still underway.The local body is racing against time as the monsoons are knocking on the door.The MC has taken 10-acre land on lease from the Waqf Board to dig a pond to drain rainwater. Workers started digging the 10-ft pond on June 18 and the work is expected to be over by July 7.Low-lying areas at the risk of flooding include localities around the district administrative complex that houses the official residences of the Bathinda deputy commissioner (DC), inspector general of police (IGP) and judicial officials, Sirki Bazaar, Mall Road, Power House Road, Parasram Nagar, Ganesha Basti and Vir Colony.Vijay Kumar Sharma, a resident of Parasram Nagar and a former municipal councillor, blames poor planning for the sad state. “A single spell of showers in March exposed the unpreparedness of the authorities. Though Parasram Nagar is prone to waterlogging, the MC has still not cleaned sewer lines,” he said.Public health activist Dr Vitull K Gupta blames haphazard urbanisation and poor planning. “Waterlogging cuts people’s access to different areas, including hospitals. Years of unplanned development and encroachment of old ponds is responsible,” he said.Sirki Bazaar Traders’ Association general secretary Satpal said, “Stagnant water, rising up to four feet, collects in the streets after each shower but no effort has been made to find a solution.”Municipal commissioner Bikram Shergill said they had lost April and May to the Covid-19 outbreak. “Additional pump sets have been sourced to drain water from low-lying areas,” he said.“Natural depression zones near Sanjay Nagar and DAV College are being de-silted and the water-holding capacity of ponds is being increased. Work to clean drains is underway and residents will not face much trouble this time,” said Shergill. Vishal JoshiPATIALA MC, DRAINAGE DEPT BEHIND SCHEDULECleaning and de-silting of water bodies and drains in Patiala are running behind schedule due to the pandemic. It will take authorities two to three weeks to complete the process.Drainage department superintending engineer Devinder Singh said de-silting is on in full swing. “Men and machines are working round-the-clock to complete the work,” he said.“This year, work was delayed due to the coronavirus pandemic. Everything from deciding to tap the main drains to arranging machines and manpower was delayed due to the lockdown,” Singh said, adding since health is a priority for the state government, the department is working with limited resources.“We received Rs 1.5 crore to clean the main drains in Patiala city and other parts of the district. We are expected to complete the work by June 30,” he said.Last year, a flood-like situation had persisted in Patiala city after Badi Naddi, the main rivulet, overflowed. The administration had to evacuate around 250 families after the water entered colonies in low-lying areas. The Ghaggar river also brought devastation. Around 10,000 acres was submerged in Patran, Sanour and Samana.Singh said the department was conducting a survey of the main rivulets, including Badi Nadi and Chhoti Nadi, to ensure their openings were not blocked.Krishan Kumar, a resident of Gopal Colony that had flooded last year, said, “People had to live in a temporary relief camp last year after water entered their residences. Authorities must ensure that we do not face such an experience this year. Moreover, instead of cleaning drains before the monsoon, authorities should make it a routine affair,” he said.Patiala MC commissioner Poonamdeep Kaur said the sewerage department had been directed to ensure de-silting of the eastern drain and the 30-km sewer lines and gullies before monsoon.The district administration has set up seven control rooms at sub-division levels to deal with flood-like situations. Deputy commissioner Kumar Amit said, “Senior officials have been instructed to ensure that there are no man-made obstructions to restrict the natural flow of water and remove encroachments on drains.”Model Town, portions of Lehal Colony, interiors of the walled city, Khalsa Mohalla, colonies situated in Tripari area and low-lying areas in the vicinity of Badi Nadi and Chhoti Nadi are prone to flooding. – Navrajdeep SinghOLD SEWERS, CHOKED GULLIES SPELL TROUBLE IN LUDHIANAEvery year, Ludhiana city has trouble due to waterlogging yet the municipal corporation (MC) officials do not plan to install storm water drains in the city.The district is sorely in need of such drains because old sewer lines are not able to keep up with the pressure due to low capacity.Most city areas are prone to water-logging, especially portions of the old city areas and the outskirts of the city.Posh areas of the city such as the Model Town extension, and Sarabha Nagar are not immune to waterlogging.In a first, the MC is getting the city’s main drain, Buddha Nullah, desilted by a private firm and residents living near the area have flagged anomalies in the process.The nullah overflows at few points, including New Kundanpuri area, Upkar Nagar and Shivpuri, almost every year during the monsoon.Former BJP councillor Narinder Malhi said, “Desilting is not being done properly and silt is not being removed from the centre. The silt that is being pulled out of the nullah is also being dumped on the banks. It will re-enter the nullah when it rains.”Authorities are also working on increasing the capacity of Talab Bazaar drain. However, residents have criticised the MC for not cleaning road gullies.A resident of Bishan Enclave, Sahil Khurana, said, “New sewer lines were installed in the area in November but the road gullies have already become choked. The MC staff had cleaned the lines a few days ago but the problem persists.”MC commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal said, “Work to clean Buddha Nullah and the road gullies is on in full swing. The MC is also getting the drain passing through the old city cleaned. The drain had been blocked for years. I have inspected the work and the staff at the sewerage treatment plants have been asked to ensure rain water does not get accumulated.”“A control room will soon be established in the coming days to deal with waterlogging woes,” he added. -Harsimran Singh Batra||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/monsoon-s-here-but-punjab-isn-t-rain-ready/story-CfOtvX8vatk6Dv1m0hRVnL.html

We are committed to provide all necessary help in this fight against Covid-19,” Railway Minister Piyush Goyal tweeted.A similar facility was started at the Mau railway station in Uttar Pradesh on June 20 where around 59 patients had been admitted.

24-06-2020||City||Historical status of Tibet must be revived to end border tensions with China: Sangay||To bring lasting peace to border incursions and tensions along the Line of Actual Control, the historical status of Tibet and its relationship with India must be revived, president of Central Tibetan Administration (CTA) Lobsang Sangay said on Wednesday.He was speaking at a special e-session hosted by the Bharat Chamber of Commerce on the theme: ‘Inda-Tibet-China: Synergising global peace’.Other key speakers at the session were Lt Gen Aniruddha Chakravarty, Air Marshall RKS Shera, members of chamber, members of Friends of Tribal Society, and members of Tibet-Bharat Metri Parishad.Sangay said the ongoing tension in the Galwan valley was not an isolated incident as China has recurrently provoked India in the past with the Doklam incident in 2017, in 1967, war in Sikkim and in 1962 war in Arunachal Pradesh.He said Tibet was historically a zone of peace and the border between Tibet and India was demilitarised. “There was no need for an army, not even a police patrol. Tibet as the buffer zone assures peace between the two countries. Tensions were build up after the India-China border came up which wasn’t there when India shared border with Tibet,” he said.Sangay proposed that if India recognises Tibet as the buffer zone all tensions will gradually subside.Speaking on India-Tibet’s historical ties, Sangay highlighted the trade relationship between British-ruled India and Tibet. A cordial trade agreement was signed which was renewed every 10 years till 1944 and there was no trade issue between India and Tibet.Then in 1954, a renewed agreement known as the Panchsheel agreement was signed which is the beginning of the downfall of Tibet and present tension between India-China.“From treachery to the current tension, we have to move to truce and tradition. That will happen only when we get back to trade and tranquility,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/historical-status-of-tibet-must-be-revived-to-end-border-tensions-with-china-sangay/story-sgiOOg69KOe11tPrlgKG1N.html
24-06-2020||Lucknow||Convening monsoon session of UP legislature before August 27 a tough call||Convening the state legislature’s monsoon session before August 27, as required under constitutional provisions, is going to be a challenge for the state government in the light of the fight against Covid-19.The legislature’s budget session ended on February 28 and under constitutional provisions ‘six months shall not intervene between its last sitting in one session and the date appointed for its first sitting in the next session.’Although chief minister Yogi Adityanath or any member of his council of ministers have not made any statement, the issue of holding sittings of the house amid the Covid-19 pandemic has obviously become a cause of concern. “The legislature’s session will be convened at an appropriate time,” said minister for parliamentary affairs Suresh Khanna.Although Khanna did not elaborate, the state government will have to keep in mind reports of spread of Covid-19 infection and make appropriate arrangements for following ‘social distancing norms’ whenever it decides to convene the next session of the legislature.There are reports that leader of the opposition Ram Govind Chaudhary and Samajwadi Party member Shailendra Yadav Lalai have tested Covid positive and are undergoing treatment.The assembly has a sanctioned strength of 403 members. It has seats for 379 members. There are five vacancies in the house now. Yet, the total strength of members remains higher than the available seats. At any given time the house should have 10 per cent members in the house to complete the quorum and this may provide an option of having a low attendance in the house to follow ‘social distancing norms’ in the fight against Covid-19.As many houses in the country may have to meet in the next few months to meet the six-month constitutional requirement, the issue came up for discussion at a video conference that Lok Sabha speaker Om Birla had with presiding officers of state legislatures on April 21.State assembly speaker Hridaya Narain Dikshit raised the issue at the video conference and said: “This is the time to consider whether the committees of parliament or committees of state legislatures can hold meetings through video conference with certain modifications. As far as holding meetings of legislatures through video conference is concerned there may be a need to consider this. The Constitution of India provides that there should not be more than six months gap between two meetings of the houses. I understand this six-month period may be nearing completion and if a meeting is called there may be social distancing rule violation.”Later this issue also came up for discussion at the ‘Smooth Functioning Committee’ meeting of presiding officers that Dikshit chaired through a video conference on May 29. Now, the question arises: Will a virtual sitting of the state legislature be possible?“As of now, the Constitution does not provide for holding a virtual meeting of the legislatures. A limited presence of members at any given time may be an option for holding a session. Members may be asked to attend the house on odd-even basis as well,” said CB Pandey, former advisor to the governor and a constitutional expert.Dikshit said the issue of convening the monsoon session of legislature is yet to be discussed. He said holding the session by August 27 would be the constitutional requirement. “So, we have sufficient time to discuss the issue,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/convening-monsoon-session-of-up-legislature-before-aug-27-a-tough-call/story-AwREw3CPzOPIbhNSpFuqyN.html
24-06-2020||Lucknow||Process for setting up State Niti Aayog may be speeded up soon in UP||Moves are afoot to set up the Uttar Pradesh State Niti Aayog, in line with the announcement made in the state budget for 2020-2021, but giving shape to the new policy formulation body may take some time due to the focus on Covid-19 these days.Minister for finance Suresh Khanna had made an announcement about setting up the State Niti Ayog in the budget he presented on February 18, 2020.“We have moved ahead with the process to set up the aayog and held discussions at various levels on the issue. However, working out on a draft for its organisational structure may take some time,” said a senior officer.If all goes well, measures to set up the aayog will be expedited in the coming weeks, he said.“Budgetary announcements are implemented in the same financial year and we hope to do so in 2020-2021 also,” said the officer, adding that the state government’s focus up to now has been on measures to check the spread of Covid-19 but the process to set up the Niti Aayog has been initiated now.The State Niti Aayog will replace the 48-year old Uttar Pradesh State Planning Commission. The commission lost its relevance when it stopped preparing the five-year plans after the union government scrapped the Planning Commission of India on January 1, 2015.The National Institution for Transforming India, referred to as NITI Aayog, replaced the Planning Commission of India as a policy think tank. The state planning commission continued to prepare the annual plans till 2017, the last year of the 12th five-year plan, but questions remained on its continuation. Change of government in 2017 gave some credence to speculations about the fate of the State Planning Commission.Announcement to set up the State Niti Aayog, replacing the State Planning Commission, hinted at an obvious shifting of focus from formulation of annual and five-year plans to formulation, evaluation and monitoring of policies.The State Planning Commission also works as a guide for district planning committees set up in every district under the provisions of Article 243 ZD of the Constitution of India. So, the state government will have to take a call to assign this role to the State Niti Aayog, when set up, or some other organisation.The State Planning Commission was set up under the chairmanship of the then chief minister in 1972 to assess the state’s physical, financial and manpower resources, draft annual and five-year plans and also to ensure conformity of the Uttar Pradesh’s plans with national plans.The state planning commission continued to prepare the annual plans till 2017, the last year of the 12th five-year plan, but questions remained on its continuation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/process-for-setting-up-state-niti-aayog-may-be-speeded-up-soon-in-up/story-oe8jKkgza9JRqIzdZzyObO.html

24-06-2020||Patna||Complaint filed in Bihar court against Baba Ramdev over Covid-19 medicine claim||A criminal complaint has been filed in a Bihar court against yoga guru Ramdev and Patanjali Ayurved MD Acharya Balkrishna, alleging that they have misled and put at risk the lives of lakhs of people by claiming to have developed a medicine to treat Covid-19. The complaint seeking registration of an FIR on cheating, criminal conspiracy and other charges was filed in the court of Chief Judicial Magistrate Mukesh Kumar here on Tuesday by Tamanna Hashmi, who identifies himself as a social worker and is often in news for his numerous court complaints against politicians over various issues. The court posted the matter for hearing on June 30.The complainant has named Ramdev, the convenor of the Patanjali Research Institute, and his aide Balkrishna, the organisation’s chairman, as accused.Hashmi submitted that Ramdev and Balkrishna claimed to have prepared “Coronil tablet” to cure Covid-19, which is nothing but misleading. The complainant submitted that the Ayush Ministry has asked Patanjali Ayurved to stop advertising and publicising its claims about the medicine.The Ayush Ministry has said that they have not been provided any information with regard to the details of the composition of the ayurvedic medicine, Hashmi said. The complainant has sought registration of a case under IPC sections 420 (cheating and dishonesty inducing delivery of property), 120B (criminal conspiracy) and 270 (malignant act likely to spread infection of disease dangerous to life), among others. Ramdev’s herbal medicine company Patanjali Ayurved has launched ‘Coronil tablet and Swasari vati’ medicines claiming they can cure the highly contagious disease within seven days.It has also claimed that the two Ayurveda-based medicines have shown 100 per cent favourable results during clinical trials on Covid-19 infected patients except those on a life support system. However, the AYUSH ministry said that the facts of the claim and details of the stated scientific study are not known to it. It has sought from the company a detailed report on composition, testing and other data of the drugs. The ministry also used powers under a 1954 law to ask the firm to “stop advertising/publicizing” claims of corona cure drug until the issue is examined by it. A government notification bars companies from advertising a cure without government approval. But it wasn’t immediately clear if the drug can still be sold. Ramdev said the medicines have been developed by Patanjali Research Center, Haridwar and privately-owned National Institute of Medical Science, Jaipur following all protocols with clinically controlled trial-based evidence. Patanjali group has an estimated turnover of around Rs 10,500 crore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/complaint-filed-in-bihar-court-against-ramdev-over-covid-19-medicine-claim/story-UIEsPIZMoDsGZAE3TcDknK.html

24-06-2020||Pune||Monsoon preparedness: ‘Killer’ nallah at mercy of rains again||The Bairobha nallah bridge, a main thoroughfare between Pune Cantonment and Wanowrie is bereft of any protective wall on either side of its banks. Between September 25 and September 26, 2019, the city received in excess of 200mm of rain. In a deluge of nallah water overflowing the banks, the need for a protective wall was never felt more urgently.The overflowing nallah flooded a Wanworie causeway between Ganga Satellite society and Raheja Gardens.Two persons, both in cars, were swept away by what was a flash flood, at the time.Software engineer Saleem Shaikh, in his car; and Victor Sangle, also in his car, were both victims.Shaikh’s body was recovered 90-km away from Pune, a few days later. Sangle (26), who survived an amputation of a leg and lived with a prosthetic, was driving from Vimannagar to visit his cousin house in Wanowrie. His car was swept away by the flash floods. Sangle’s body has not been recovered.The College of Engineering Pune (COEP), in the aftermath of the flash floods, submitted a structural audit that recommended protective walls of up to 50 metres in height, both upstream and downstream at the Bairobha nallah bridge, as a necessary safety precaution against a future flood situation. The Pune Cantonment Board (PCB) issued the no-objection certificate (NOC) for the walls, which the Pune municipal corporation (PMC) was tasked with constructing, as part of its overall monsoon preparedness in the light of the 2019 floods.The walls have not been built.The Bairobha nallah runs a total length of 26km - starting from Yeolewadi till Koregaon Park, where the water body merges with the Mula-Mutha river.Suresh Jagtap, PMC’s deputy commissioner (Zone IV), said, “We are currently dealing with the Covid crisis and even a site inspection has not been done. The executive engineer is looking into the case.” PMC’s executive engineer Pravin Gedam did not respond to phone calls and text messages.Amit Kumar, CEO, PCB, said, “We had given our NOC to the PMC and it had committed to finishing the work, which, however, has not been completed. There is a risk to the lives of the people and the board is constantly assessing the situation unfolding at the spot.” Vinod Mathurawala, a former PCB vice-president, said, “The NOC has been given, but work has not progressed. We request the PMC to finish the work at the earliest.” “The bridge safety work needs to be completed by the PMC at the earliest as we are already in the monsoon season. These works should have been completed before the monsoon. We need a flood alarm system, adequate street lights and strong protective walls to protect the lives of the commuters and area residents,” said Kiran Mantri, an elected member of the PCB.Local residents said if the bridge is not repaired, most parts in Wanowrie, where the bridge is situated, will witness a repeat of last year. Wanowrie resident Manjett Singh Virdi said, “Commuters are still afraid of using the bridge. Senior citizens avoid using the bridge till date as the fear of death lurks at the spot.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/monsoon-preparedness-killer-nallah-at-mercy-of-rains-again/story-Z40ZZwFCZlVEeLJBA53b5K.html

24-06-2020||Lucknow||Career counselling centres on cards||After doing skill-mapping of the migrants who returned to the state from their workplaces across the country amid Covid-19 lockdown, the UP government is now setting up nearly 850 career counselling centres to connect these job seekers with job providers. “Nearly 35 lakh migrant workers have returned to the state. We did their skill-mapping. Many of them are skilled and semi-skilled and had been doing well where they worked. Now, when they have completed their quarantine period, they want jobs. They would like to get jobs as per their practised skills. So we planned career counselling centres in all the development blocks to connect the job seekers and job givers,” said UP chief secretary RK Tiwari. He said he had last week issued a circular to all districts about the career counselling centres and help-desks for the migrant workers and the process had begun. “They would begin functioning by the end of this month,” Tiwari said.“In case any worker wishes to return to his original workplace and seeks help, the help desk should also take care of providing all the assistance to such people,” the chief secretary said in the circular.A committee under the chief development officer in each district of the state will be set up to oversee the implementation of the idea and regular review will also be done.In a circular to all additional chief secretaries, principal secretaries, department heads, commissioners and district magistrates, Tiwari said: “Considering the return of migrant workers from various states under Covid-19 lockdown, it is important to get them jobs keeping in mind their skills. So, organise career counselling for them to tell them about employment opportunities and give them information about various government schemes.”“Establish a help desk at Vikas Bhawan and block development officer’s (BDO) office in each district and appoint an in charge for each help desk,” he added.Tiwari said the block development officer would decide dates for career counselling and invite the labourers for counselling which must be held while following social distancing norms.“Also install a helpline for telephonic counselling for those who find it difficult to reach the help desk,” he said.The CDO, on the 7th day of each month, through the district magistrate would provide the counselling information to the district’s directorate of training and employment office. Officers from various departments would also tell about government schemes and register them. They would be told about employment opportunities, training programmes and also loan facilities for self-employment.Talking about migrants’ skills, Tiwari said they are electricians, tailors, carpenters, masons, etc. Such skilled workers could get works in Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises sector and could also be employed under rural livelihood mission, self-help groups and even go for self-employment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/career-counselling-centres-on-cards/story-G3lJeLH62UmGK0YxzRgkbL.html

24-06-2020||Chandigarh||Ladakh faceoff will not change locals’ perception towards us, says Shimla’s Chinese community||CHANDIGARH: Shimla’s handmade Chinese shoes are perhaps as big a tourist draw as the verdant hills themselves.The shoes and lip-smacking Chinese delicacies, particularly the momos, have become a part of the state’s culture. While people across the nation have called for a boycott of Chinese products after the Galwan Valley standoff, Chinese-origin traders here have no reason to complain.John Chung, the owner of Shimla’s iconic Hopson & Co shoe shop on Mall Road, says, “There has been no change of behaviour towards us. Shimla is a small town everybody knows us. My family came here in the ’50s and the art of shoe-making has been passed down from generation to generation. The third generation of our family has been born and bred in India. We are well integrated and proficient in Hindi.”On what he felt about the rift in relations between the two countries, he says, “It is a sad development, indeed. Hopefully, things will improve.”‘FIND DIPLOMATIC SOLUTION’Brenda Chiu, the proprietor of the popular eatery Dim Sum on Mall Road and the Minsen Beauty Parlour, says, “My grandparents, too, were born in India so China is no longer a country of origin for me. We are all Indians so we don’t feel conflicted about the Indo-Chinese faceoff.”“A war, be it with any country, needs to be avoided and a diplomatic solution must be sought,” she said.Ask her if business has been affected and she says, “Business is down everywhere because of Covid-19. Everybody knows us in Shimla and there has been no change in behaviour or any anti-Chinese sentiment towards us. A war will not change locals’ perception towards us.”Though Chung’s business has been affected because of Covid-19, loyal customers from Himachal Pradesh, Haryana, Punjab and Chandigarh are still placing online orders.GENERATION GAP, DIFFERENT VOICESNirmal Thakur, a retired public sector employee with a penchant for Chinese handmade shoes, says, “The Chinese community in Shimla is as Indian as anybody else. They have been living here for generations. It will be foolhardy of anybody to punish Chinese-origin entrepreneurs over the Indo-Chinese conflict. Yes, the government should reduce import and give impetus to make in India.”However, Manoj Kumar, 28, a bank officer at a private bank in Shimla, says, “There has definitely been an attitude change towards the Chinese. They are staying here and profiting, while their country of origin is on warpath with us. The government should try to sort out the matter at the diplomatic level and reduce Chinese imports.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ladakh-faceoff-will-not-change-locals-perception-towards-us-says-shimla-s-chinese-community/story-OkmU0uhAaNNHJPjCgT1ecK.html

Once things normalise, the officials will visit Bihar to discuss the details,” Rajak said and added that efforts were being made to rope in more industrial houses.“ITC is planning to make a big investment, which will be beside the small units it has in Munger and Purnia,” he said.Sources said the food processing units were interested to set up at Motipur in Muzaffarpur or in or near Patna. “Road connectivity with the capital could be the reason for setting up units in Muzaffarpur,” one of the persons cited above said.An official of the industries department said on the condition of anonymity that the technical team of these industries will first visit to see the availability of land and other infrastructure needed for the projects.The Bihar government has been harping its strength that as it is a major grain and fruit-producing state, there is immense scope of investment for food processing units in the region. It has also said that it will soon tweak the Industrial Investment Promotion Policy.Earlier, the industries minister had written to 25 houses, including Nestle India, Parag Milk Foods Ltd, GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare Ltd, Jubilant Foodworks Ltd, KRBL Ltd, LT Food Ltd and Hindustan Food Ltd among others to invite them to invest in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/patna/itc-among-four-industrial-houses-keen-to-invest-in-bihar/story-r9ufVUiFPLoHRcuALarMwL.html

24-06-2020||Delhi||‘Not a fight between Amit Shah’s model and Kejriwal model’: Manish Sisodia wants new Covid-19 SOPs scrapped||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said on Wednesday that he has written to Union home minister Amit Shah to restore the old Covid-19 testing rules in Delhi.“I had requested Lt Governor to change the rule under which every Covid-19 patient is required to visit a quarantine centre for assessment. It has been two days, but I haven’t received any reply. This new system has created pressure on administration,” Sisodia said at a briefing.“Today, I have written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah requesting him to do away with this system as it will create chaos,” he further said.“This is not fight between Amit Shah’s model and Kejriwal’s model. We should implement system in which people don’t face problems,” Sisodia said.The Delhi government had formalised the new Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for Covid-19 testing on Monday under which the new patients will have to visit an assessment centre to get themselves checked. The doctors present at the centre will assess a patient based on the severity of symptoms and health history of any co-morbid condition and accordingly decide whether the patient requires an institutional quarantine or home isolation.A separate team will carry out house checks to see whether there is a stand-alone room and bathroom that a Covid-19 patient needs for home isolation so that other members of the family are not infected.These SOPs were first suggested by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), led by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal. The Delhi government said that this requires special ambulances to transport Covid-19 patients and additional manpower, which is currently a problem.The new rules led to such chaos that at least three of the 11 districts of Delhi have not been able to adopt the protocol since they have too many new cases to handle, officials from these districts told HT on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had also urged the Centre and Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal to restore the old system, saying the home isolation plan has been working very well.The protracted row started on Friday after Baijal scrapped the home isolation plan of Delhi government. Though the order was reversed on Saturday, the DDMA introduced the mandatory assessment.The Centre has been regularly monitoring the situation the situation in Delhi after a huge spike in Covid-19 cases in the national capital. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded its largest single-day spike of Covid-19 cases so far with 3,947 people testing positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/not-a-fight-between-amit-shah-s-model-and-kejriwal-model-manish-sisodia-wants-new-covid-19-sops-scrapped/story-9w9eAh9P17ngcfsbDLBQuN.html

But online classes and exams are being held by both private and government schools over smartphones.“The boy’s family was very poor. His mother had gone to Bangalore in search of work and his father didn’t have any job. The boy needed a phone to take part in online classes but his father was not able to get him one,” Sudhakar Singh, Chirang’s superintendent of police, said.“From what we have been able to gather after talking to neighbours and others close to the student, it appears he was fed up with the situation and decided to take his own life,” he added.Though some reports said a suicide note was found, the police have denied it. The post-mortem report is awaited.A Class 10 student in Kerala’s Malappuram district had set herself on fire earlier this month as she was unable to attend online classes as she did not have either a television or a smartphone.(Please reach out to your nearest mental health specialist if you need support or know someone who does.

24-06-2020||Pune||NCP wanted to join hands with BJP two years ago: Fadnavis||BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis on Tuesday claimed the NCP wanted to join hands with his party two years ago and asserted this is not the time to talk about fall or change of government in Maharashtra which is battling the coronavirus pandemic.Addressing a press conference here, the former Chief Minister claimed the Sharad Pawar-headed Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) wanted to be a part of the BJP-led government in Maharashtra two years ago.The leader of opposition in the assembly said “This is not the time to do any valuation of the government. This is the right time to raise questions (regarding the Covid-19 management), this is the time to point out shortcomings.“But this is not the time to evaluate the government on the basis of its shortcomings. This is not the time to say change CM or there is no need of this government.” As the main opposition party, the BJP is highlighting shortcomings of the Shiv Sena-Congress-NCP government, he said.“All we need to see is how can the shortcomings can be removed and how can they be put forth before the government and that is what we are doing,” said Fadnavis.To a question, he clarified that no new political equation is evolving in the state, where the BJP lost power late last year.“There is no new equation. To change the government or (push for) fall of the government is not our agenda...everyone is seeing how the government is running and there is no need for me to see it differently,” the former chief minister said.Replying to a question regarding his interview to a Marathi news channel, Fadnavis said the NCP wanted to join hands with the BJP in the state two years ago when he was the chief minister.“They wanted to come with us two years ago. There were meetings in this regard but our senior leaders made it clear that the BJP will not be able to do so without (approval of) the Shiv Sena.“They (BJP leaders) said we can isolate the Congress but the Shiv Sena needs to be with us. If it is okay, we can go ahead (with NCP proposal). As this was the stand of our senior leaders, the entire process, which had gone quite far, went into cold storage,” he claimed.Asked about his dramatic early morning swearing-in as chief minister along with NCP leader Ajit Pawar as deputy CM last November, Fadnavis said he is going to write a book on the entire episode, which had created a flutter.“I have said in my interview that I am going to going to write a book on that entire episode. If I reveal all suspense now, there will no demand for the book,” he said.In November last year, the Shiv Sena snapped ties with the BJP and joined hands with the NCP and the Congress, its long-standing political rivals, to form the Maha Vikas Aghadi government in Maharashtra.Fadnavis was here to review the Covid-19 situation in Pune city and the adjoining Pimpri-Chinchwad.He said Covid-19 testing capacity needs to be ramped up in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/ncp-wanted-to-join-hands-with-bjp-two-years-ago-fadnavis/story-oaqTOO3j4pHmIzAb4yV4kL.html

The vandals also turned over and destroyed food warmers, while the front desk area was gutted, plates smashed and the kitchen rendered completely unusable, it said.“I walked into the kitchen, I saw everything and I was like, hold on, what? What is going on here?” owner Baljit Singh told Santa Fe Reporter. “White power,” “Trump 2020,” “Go home,” and far worse were spray-painted on walls, doors, counters and any other available surface. “Some phrases contained threats of violence and derogatory racial slurs,” the daily said.The restaurant had reopened only recently after being closed due to the Covid-19 restrictions.“Santa Fe is a peaceful town, and the Sikh community has lived here, beautifully integrated, since the ’60s,” said SALDEF board member Simran Singh, who lives minutes away from the restaurant.“Tensions have flared recently with the reinvigoration of the Black Lives Matter movement and the removal of statues associated with Spanish colonisers of this area, who committed a number of atrocities,” he said.“Nevertheless, we are seeing an outpouring of love and support around the city and in my experience, our neighbours love and appreciate us, as we love and appreciate them,” he added.COMMUNITY COMES OUT IN SUPPORTGovernor Michelle Lujan Grisham tweeted on Tuesday, “We will not stand for such hatred in New Mexico.” She added that she had spoken to Baljit Singh to “let him know that our community is with him”.Mayor Alan Webber described the vandalism a “sickening and appalling” hate crime and vowed, “We will find whoever did it and punish them to the full extent of the law.”He said, “The Singhs are a long-standing Sikh family that has used its own resources to feed homeless Santa Feans through the goodness of their hearts. For them to be attacked this way breaks our hearts.”The Singh family distributes free packages of food and sanitary products for homeless people in the area and these items were stolen during the attack, according to the Reporter.The Reporter said that five fundraising campaigns have been launched to help the restaurant.A GoFundMe campaign by another restaurant, Paper Dosa, had raised more than $35,000 (Rs 26.4 lakh), the New Mexican said.MISTAKEN FOR TERROR OUFIT ISLAMIC STATEOne of the pictures of the graffiti posted on the Reporter’s website was against the terrorist organisation Islamic State.Because of their turbans, Sikhs are sometimes mistaken for Islamists or Iranian clergy who are represented in the media with turbans and are attacked.The Council on American-Islamic Relations National Communications Director Ibrahim Hooper said in a statement, “This disturbing hate attack once again demonstrates that growing white supremacy, xenophobia, Islamophobia, and racism target every minority community and must be challenged by people of all races, faiths and backgrounds.”SALDEF said that it has seen an unprecedented rise in hate crimes including the April 29 incident wherein a Sikh American Lakhwant Singh was brutally attacked by a man identified as Eric Breeman in Lakewood, Colorado.Lakhwant Singh was told to “go back to your country,” while being attacked. No formal hate crime charges have been brought against the attacker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sikh-owned-restaurant-vandalised-in-us-racist-graffiti-written-at-site/story-U3YDTjCN59gwJJzA90XyML.html

The revised Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) further said that the patients will be examined by a medical officer at the testing site to assess the severity of illness.This, the Delhi government said, requires special ambulances and more medical staff, something the authorities say are short in number.“There is a lot of panic among people because of the new guidelines. Earlier, they tried to stop home isolation and a consensus on continuing it was reached after a lot of dialogue. Now, (there is) this new guideline... why should a Covid-19 patient be made to stand in a queue at a quarantine centre? I have written to the L-G to continue with the earlier system of the medical team visiting the home of coronavirus patients instead,” Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia at a press briefing on Tuesday.The revised guidelines were announced after an order on home isolation by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal was modified.In view of the surge in the coronavirus cases, the Lt Governor had last week ordered mandatory institutional quarantine. The move was opposed by the AAP government.The new SOPs say that the assessment centre will decide about the clinical conditions, severity of illness and presence of co-morbidities.Simultaneously, physical assessment will also be done whether adequate facilities for home isolation like minimum of two rooms and a separate toilet exists so that family members and neighbours are protected, and a cluster of cases does not develop in that locality, the order said.The new rules led to such chaos that at least three of the 11 districts of Delhi have not been able to adopt the protocol since they have too many new cases to handle, officials from these districts told HT on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-urges-centre-to-restore-old-system-of-checking-covid-19-patients/story-pyX4o74NdonJ3a8kQ958gJ.html
24-06-2020||Pune||12 trainee sailors of INS Shivaji test positive for Covid-19||At least 12 trainee sailors of the Lonavala-based INS Shivaji, one of the premier training establishments of the Indian Navy, have so far tested positive for coronavirus, officials said.The first case was found on June 18 and the infected cadet was part of a batch of 157 trainee sailors who had reported back after leave following the easing of lockdown earlier this month, a release issued by the naval station on Tuesday said.“With the easing of lockdown as per Unlock 1.0 in the first week of June, a batch of 157 trainee sailors who were undergoing training at this establishment and were on extended leave in view of the lockdown, reported back and all were quarantined for 14 days in one of the institutional quarantine facilities prepared in the unit,” it said.One of the trainee sailors from the batch was found to be symptomatic during the quarantine period and tested positive for coronavirus on June 18, it said.“Further, all the other high-risk contacts who are staying in that particular quarantine facility are being tested as per the extant procedure and necessary medical support is being provided. A total of 12 out of157 trainee sailors have been found coronavirus positive as on date,” the release said.Since the infection is contained to one particular quarantine block, the possibility of spread of infection to other areas/personnel of the establishment is negligible.However, all precautions have been instituted to obviate further spread, it said.All precautions, instructions and directions issued with respect to Covid-19 by the Government of India and the Indian Navy, from time to time, are being strictly adhered to, the release said.All personnel in the base are already maintaining the required precautions against Covid-19, it added.INS Shivaji is an Indian Naval station located in the hill-town of Lonavala in Maharashtra’s Pune district. It houses the Naval College of Engineering which trains officers of the Indian Navy and the Indian Coast Guard.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/12-trainee-sailors-of-ins-shivaji-test-positive-for-covid-19/story-SNnKEppaC7yGQfczRrPBQP.html
24-06-2020||Ranchi||Covid-19 cases in non-migrants on rise in Jharkhand||The spread of Covid-19 pandemic continues unabated in Jharkhand, which after two spells of spike, one related to Tablighi Jamaat and the other to migrants’ inflow, is now witnessing a steep rise in positive cases among the non-migrant population.While 70 cases were detected in non-migrants in May, as many as 205 cases have been reported from the section in the first 22 days of June. In comparison to the last month, cases in this section have registered a growth of 192% till June 22.Experts, however, say the rise of cases in the non-migrant section is quite worrisome as it is indicative of community transmission of the disease.Director of the state’s premier medical college and hospital, Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Dr DK Singh said, “In Unlock-1, interstate movement of people has been allowed. There is also no restriction in movement within the city, town and other areas. Not only migrants are returning to the state but also the people from other sections.”In the case of migrants, a majority of them were put in institutional quarantine and therefore, they were segregated. But, in other cases, there were no such segregation, so cases from this section are bound to rise, he added.Singh said, “We are noticing that a majority of ill patients coming to the hospital are testing Covid-19 positive. We need to increase the testing, especially through random sampling, to find out if there is any community spread.”However, a recent survey of state’s three districts by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) didn’t indicate any possibility of community transmission.However, the government has urged the council to conduct the survey across the state.According to the state health department, the state had 110 positive cases by the end of April, when the return of migrants had not started.These cases were primarily linked to the Tablighi Jammat event in New Delhi.From May 1 onwards, migrant workers, stranded in different states, started returning home through special flights, trains, buses and other modes of transportation.Till June 12, over 5.12 lakh migrant workers had arrived from different states in the state.Those, who had returned from red zone cities like Mumbai, Surat, Delhi and others, were put in institutional quarantine.The state health machinery then shifted its focus to these quarantine centres from where positive cases started coming in hoards.In the month of May alone, as many as 500 confirmed cases were unearthed, including 430 cases found in migrants.Of the total cases found in May, only 14% cases (70) were reported from the non-migrant section.A steep surge in the number of Covid-19 cases has been noticed in the current month as total positive cases climbed to 2,140 on June 22 from 610 on May 31.Of the 1,530 cases found in the first 22 days of June, 1,325 were detected among migrants and remaining 205 in non-migrant section, which accounts for over 13% of the total cases found in this month so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/covid-19-cases-in-non-migrants-on-rise-in-jharkhand/story-FwlfyFbA9nhH7yFhKsxAQK.html

But this year, the Rath Yatra programme could not be held, so I bowed before him and sought forgiveness,” he told reporters after offering prayers at the temple.“The world is in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. The decision to suspend the age-old Rath Yatra programme this year had to be taken with a heavy heart,” he said.The chief minister said he prayed for victory over the pandemic.The Jagannathpur temple was constructed atop a hill in Ranchi’s Dhurva area in 1691 by Badkagardh Nagavanshi Raja Thakur Ani Nath Shahdeo, and the first chariot had rolled the very next year.Since then till 2019, according to Jagannathpur temple manager Tiwari, the Rath Yatra rituals had been performed without any interruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/ranchi/covid-19-no-rath-yatra-in-ranchi-for-first-time-in-over-300-years/story-tEVL4NsJEtKASS9pNc71dL.html
24-06-2020||Lucknow||Set up Covid-19 help desks in police stations, hospitals and govt offices: CM Yogi Adityanath||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Tuesday directed that Covid help desks be set up in all police stations, hospitals, government offices, tehsils/revenue courts, development blocks and jails in UP. The help desks must be manned by at least two people all time from morning till evening, he said.Talking about the function of the help desk, Yogi said that all these help desks must have awareness material related to Covid-19 prevention and safety measures. They must have oximeters, infrared thermometers and sanitizers for screening employees or inmates at the establishments. “Before putting two people on each task, train them well for handling the equipments and at the same tackling their own safety. They must wear masks and gloves all the time,” he said.Discussing the Unlock situation in the state with a high-level Covid-19 management team, the CM said, “Also encourage the private hospitals to have similar help desks.”Talking about tests and surveillance the chief minister said: “Continue to increase the number of tests per day and consolidate Covid-19 surveillance arrangements. For strengthening surveillance and testing, we are now sending special secretary level officers to each district. These officers should camp in the districts and help the chief medical officer (CMO). Also, the government will assess the work that these special secretary-level officers would do in these times of Covid-19 emergency.”“Soon increase the total number of medical teams for Covid-19 screening to one lakh. All team members must have masks, gloves and sanitizers. Admit asymptomatic patients to the hospitals for treatment and also take adequate steps to protect medical teams from infection,” Yogi said.The chief minister instructed the smooth operation of free ration distribution work without compromising on Covid-19 safety guidelines. “Strengthen arrangements in cow shelters and pay special attention to cattle diseases in view of the monsoon. Run intensive drive to check illegal arms,” Yogi said.Among those who attended the meeting were medical education minister, Suresh Khanna, health minister Jai Pratap Singh, minister of state for health, Atul Garg, chief secretary, RK Tiwari, infrastructure and industrial development commissioner, Alok Tandon, agriculture development commissioner, Alok Sinha and additional chief secretary (home), Awanish K Awasthi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow/set-up-covid-19-help-desks-in-police-stations-hospitals-and-govt-offices-cm-yogi-adityanath/story-quUQakrhOymp0O70jcvxdL.html

However, the market situation is such that the customer is reaping the benefits. I bought many suits and sarees at discounts upto 50% from Meena Bazaar in Karol Bagh, for my wedding trousseau. The shoppers in the store were limited and that just meant more attention from the shop keeper, which is a scenario that I couldn’t imagine in this season had we been in the pre-corona times,” says Neha Bindal, a Delhiite.  A post shared by Meena Bazaar (@meenabazaar) on Jun 13, 2020 at 4:14am PDTAlongside offering amazing deals, shopping stores in Delhi-NCR have been sanitised to ensure safety of everyone. “It’s commendable how stores have followed government guidelines. The shopping experience for me wasn’t scary at all. As long as you take all the precautions, shopping at this time can get you some amazing deals,” says Kavita Yadav, a Gurugram resident.  A post shared by Frontier Raas (@frontierraas) on May 20, 2020 at 5:49am PDTStores confirm that they have taken all the necessary precautions and are offering substantial discounts to those interesting in loosening the purse strings. Gaurang Batra, director, Frontier Raas, says, “We are offering special offers in store, and our stores are being sanitised on an hourly basis. Our staff and patrons have to undertake the mandatory temperature checks, and entry into the store is allowed only after checking the Aarogya Setu app on their phone.

24-06-2020||Delhi||Silver lining despite rise in Delhi’s coronavirus cases||Delhi on Tuesday recorded its largest single-day spike of coronavirus cases (Covid-19) so far with 3,947 people testing positive, although this number came on the back of a sharp increase in testing in the state — 16,952 samples were tested on Tuesday. Tuesday’s spike took the tally in the city to 66,602, with more than 40% of these cases coming in just the last 10 days. The number of deaths touched 2,301, with 68 new fatalities reported in the last 24 hours, according to the Delhi government’s health bulletin.However, an analysis of Delhi’s Covid-19 data by HT offered a much-needed silver lining. With the number of new recoveries and discharges picking up pace in the past few days, the number of active cases in the city have actually reduced by 1,363 in the last week. [Chart 1] That means Delhi has seen more recoveries than new cases. Active cases — calculated by subtracting recovered patients and deaths from the tally — are a key metric to understand the weight of the caseload that hospitals have to handle. The relative stability in active cases traces its source to a recent boost in recovery numbers — nearly 62% of all recoveries have been reported in just the last 10 days.The recent spike in cases also comes on the heels of testing in Delhi being ramped up using rapid antigen kits last Thursday, with the proportion of tests turning out positive beginning to decrease [Chart 2]. At 23.2%, this number, called the positivity rate, was still among the highest in the country in absolute terms on Tuesday, but it has been decreasing on an average over the past week.The number of average daily tests more than doubled to 13,880 for the week ending June 23 compared to 6,200 the week before. The new test kits, which give results within 30 minutes, are being used at 193 centres across Delhi’s 11 districts. To be sure, the use of the rapid tests has meant a relaxation of testing norms in Delhi, which experts said was expected to lead to drop in positivity rate. Earlier only people who had a history of contact with positive cases or those who showed symptoms were getting tested in the Capital, but under the rapid tests, all residents of Delhi’s containment zones will get tested. The positivity rate for the week ending June 22 stood at 24%, meaning nearly one in every four people tested turned out positive. This number was 31% a week before. The number is still high in but it has begun to decline -- a clear indication that Delhi is finally beginning to test enough.  Covid deaths also appear to have stabilised over the past week, even as a massive spike is seen in new recoveries [Chart 3]. Even though there hasn’t been an official statement on the increase in the number of patients who have recovered or discharged, officials familiar with the matter said that this is due to Delhi aligning its discharge policy with the Union health ministry’s latest guidelines. As per the health ministry guidelines, mild to moderate Covid-19 patients can be discharged without testing on the 10th day of the symptoms appearing and/or three days after resolution of symptoms.Delhi government said it is focussing on increased testing and containment zones. “An increase in testing have shown to decrease positivity rates worldwide. At the same time all our additional testing is focused completely on containment zones which tend to have infected patients as well. Overall, it looks like a result of additional testing and effective containment,” a Delhi government spokesperson said on Tuesday.Experts, however, advised caution in reading into numbers just yet. “Positivity rates should not be used to predict the course of the infection in the city. This is because of two reasons. One, Delhi has just started using rapid antigen kits which does not give false positive reports but due to lower sensitivity than RT-PCR test must be missing some positive cases,” said Dr Shobha Broor, former head of the department of microbiology at AIIMS. “Two, there have been a lot of changes in the city’s testing strategy that is bound to affect the positivity rate,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/silver-lining-despite-delhi-coronavirus-cases-rise/story-YHjNdIzQfvRoJrlvbB8snJ.html
24-06-2020||City||Maharashtra government declares 29.53-sq-km area in Konkan a conservation reserve||The Maharashtra government on Tuesday declared 29.53 square kilometre (sq km) area, comprising 10 villages in Dodamarg taluka, Sindhudurg district, as the Tillari Conservation Reserve.This is the first notified conservation reserve along the Konkan coast and the seventh in the state.With this decision, a certain section of the Dodamarg-Sawantwadi corridor, which has been under threat from mining, receives protection under the Wildlife Protection Act, 1972.Conservation reserves are protected areas that act as buffer zones or migration corridors between established national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, reserved and protected forests of India. However, these protected areas do not have surrounding eco-sensitive zones (protected buffers) as sanctuaries or national parks do. Also, any developmental or agricultural activity proposed within the reserve needs approval from the state and central wildlife boards.The notification published on Tuesday by the revenue and forest department shows the area was protected based on the presence of tigers, elephants, and leopards. Other fauna include sloth bears, civets, pangolins, several resident and migratory bird species, and even the Indian giant squirrel (Maharashtra’s state animal). The flora includes 303 plant species, 127 types of trees including 99 medicinal plants. “Tillari Conservation Reserve is a source of perennial water bodies, and an integral part of the Sahyadri-Konkan wildlife corridor. With this declaration, development activities are restricted, while mining is prohibited across 29.53 sq km areas, safeguarding the rich biodiversity of the tropical semi-evergreen and moist deciduous forests. We will be setting up a committee to look after management and conservation of the reserve,” said Nitin Kakodkar, principal chief conservator of forest (wildlife), Maharashtra. Located in the heart of the biodiversity hotspot, Western Ghats, the protected area falls between Maharashtra, Goa and Karnataka. This will be the 13th protected area along the Western Ghats in Maharashtra and 62nd across the state (including sanctuaries, national parks and tiger reserves).“The reserve will act as a connector through the Western Ghat ridges, connecting the Mhadei Wildlife Sanctuary in north Goa and the Bhimgad Wildlife Sanctuary in Karnataka’s Belgaum district in the south to the Radhanagari Wildlife Sanctuary in Kolhapur district which lies in the north,” said Kakodkar. According to the state forest department, there are four resident tigers – two adults and two sub-adults – present within the notified area. “The Tilari ecosystem has a breeding tiger population, and acts as a source population for the Sahyadri Tiger Reserve,” said V Clement Ben, chief conservator of forest, Kolhapur. A transient population of around 25 tigers have been documented moving through the corridor over five years. A family of five pachyderms (three adults including two tuskers, a female and their two calves) have also been spotted moving through the protected zone. Altogether, there are of 19 species of mammals, 12 species of amphibians, 71 species of birds, 60 species of butterflies, two species of damselflies, 16 species of reptiles, four species of scorpions, four species of spiders and five species of other invertebrates, according to biodiversity assessments carried out over the years, said Ben, adding, “This is a win-win situation, in which the wildlife corridor is getting strengthened and sustainable livelihood model for the fringe villagers are ensured. At the same time ecotourism shall find a fillip in the days to come.”The 10 villages in Dodamarg taluka that form the reserve’s boundary include Bambarde, Ghatiwade, Kendre Bank, Kendre Khadi, Patiye, Shirange, Konal, Ainode, Hewale and Medhe. The entire Dodamarg taluka has 53 villages. The notification, however, did not include the extension of the water body (Tillari dam) within the taluka.Petitioners striving to protect the Dodamarg-Sawantwadi corridor before the Bombay high court (HC) said the latest notification included eight of the 38 villages from Dodamarg taluka they sought protection for. “The notification of the reserve and orders to declare the entire corridor an eco-sensitive area are two separate subjects. We welcome that certain section of this corridor is now protected due to this notification but we need to be wary of surrounding areas that are still open to the mining lobby, and need similar safety,” said Stalin D, director, Vanashakti and petitioner before the HC. Area was originally proposed as a wildlife sanctuary: Forest department In 2016, the Maharashtra forest department had proposed to declare 57 sq km area of Tillari as a wildlife sanctuary across 25 villages, but after stiff opposition from locals, the proposed protected area was reduced to 29.53 sq km. “Locals were worried that declaring the area a sanctuary would hamper developmental work, economic losses and livelihood issues. Thus, the plan was altered, the area was reduced and the locals were taken into confidence before the final notification for the conservation reserve was issued,” said Kakodkar.State’s seven conservation reserves2008: 3.49 sqkm Borgad Conservation Reserve (eastern Nashik) 2013: 180.72 sqkm Kolamarka Conservation Reserve (Gadchiroli) 2014: 122.74 sqkm Muktai Bhawani Conservation Reserve (Jalgaon) 2014: 54.46sqkm Mamdapur Conservation Reserve (near Nashik)2016: 93.42 sqkm Tornamal Conservation Reserve (near Nandurbar) 2017: 5.69 sqkm Anjaneri Conservation Reserve (near Nashik) 2020: 29.53 sqkm Tillari Conservation Reserve (Sindhudurg) What is a conservation reserveAccording to the Union environment ministry, conservation reserves are protected areas that act as buffer zones or connectors and migration corridors between established national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and reserved and protected forests of India.These protected area categories were first introduced in the Wildlife (Protection) Amendment Act, 2002. These categories were added because of reduced protection in and around existing or proposed protected areas due to private ownership of land and land useWith this latest declaration, there are now 92 conservation reserves in India across 12 states. Jammu and Kashmir has the maximum reserves (34), followed by Karnataka (15) and Rajasthan (11).(Source: National Wildlife Database, Wildlife Institute of India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/maharashtra-government-declares-29-53-sq-km-area-in-konkan-a-conservation-reserve/story-OpmsdlK6dyR55at5JBntCL.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||500-km expressway running through 3 districts of Konkan?||Taking a cue from the previous government that led the ambitious 701-km Mumbai-Nagpur expressway or Samruddhi corridor, the Uddhav Thackeray-led Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has taken the first step towards constructing a 500-km greenfield Konkan expressway. The state’s infrastructure arm, Maharashtra State Road Development Corporation (MSRDC) on Tuesday issued a request for proposal to appoint consultancy services to prepare a feasibility report and detailed project report on the expressway. In March, state urban development minister Eknath Shinde had announced that a greenfield expressway will be constructed along the Maharashtra coastline, connecting the three districts of Raigad, Ratnagiri, and Sindhudurg. The state is looking at starting the expressway from Chirle in Raigad where the under-construction 22km sea-bridge – the Mumbai Trans Harbour Link (MTHL) – ends. The expressway will extend till Patradevi at the Maharashtra-Goa border in Sindhudurg district. Shinde had said that the project would help boost coastal tourism and reduce stress on the Mumbai-Goa National Highway. Radheshyam Mopalwar, vice-chairman and managing director, MSRDC, said, “The consultant will be expected to look at the feasibility of the project along with the social and environmental impact. It will also propose a financial model that can be adopted.” MSRDC has undertaken the construction of the Samruddhi corridor at ₹55,000 crore. It will reduce travel time between Mumbai and Nagpur to eight hours. The corporation has also undertaken the construction of the Versova-Bandra sea link at ₹7,000 crore and is looking to extend it till Virar at an additional cost of ₹24,000 crore. Transport experts said that the expenditure on a new mega project needs to be justified by the government. “Any road project means high expenditure. If the project is looking at boosting public transport, then it can benefit people. Also, the Konkan railway is still not utilised to its full potential, so there needs to be a better reason for the new project,” said Paresh Rawal, a Mumbai-based transport expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/500-km-expressway-running-through-3-districts-of-konkan/story-aOWPYngvhozZgi1EehARXK.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||Elgar Parishad case: HC asks Centre, NIA to respond after plea claims probe transfer was politically motivated||A petition filed by criminal lawyer Surendra Gadling and poet Sudhir Dhawale, both accused in the Elgar Parishad case, before the Bombay high court (HC), has challenged the case being transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), claiming it to be politically motivated as a charge sheet and a supplementary charge sheet were already filed by Pune police. In the petition filed last week, Gadling and Dhawale alleged that the transfer of the probe was done by the Central government as the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lost power in Maharashtra.The case, in which several other rights activists have been arrested and accused of having Maoist links, was transferred from the Pune police to the NIA on January 24 this year. According to the prosecution, inflammatory speeches and provocative statements made at the Elgar Parishad conclave held in Pune on December 31, 2017, triggered caste violence at Bhima-Koregaon the next day.An HC division bench of justices SS Shinde and Abhay Ahuja on Tuesday asked the Central government and NIA to respond to the petition. Additional solicitor general Anil Singh and advocate Sandesh Patil, appearing for the Centre and NIA respectively, sought time from the court to take instructions and file their response to the petition, which the court accepted, and posted the matter for hearing on July 14.The petitioners claimed that “no doubt the scheme of the act does not expressly stipulate the stage at which the investigation needs to be transferred to the NIA, however, the same cannot be read to grant to the Central Government an unbridled and unguided power to direct investigation of scheduled offences by NIA long after the charge sheet was filed in the Court by the Investigation Agency of the State Government, purely for political concerns”.The petition went on to state that the Central government had specific knowledge about the offence as early as 2018, but had not directed the NIA to investigate for a period of one- and-a-half years.“On the contrary, it [Central government] allowed the state police to continue with the investigation and showed complete faith in it and defended the investigation by state police machinery before the Supreme Court(SC) in a petition filed by Romila Thapar,” read the petition.The petitioners went to state that Tushar Mehta, additional solicitor general appearing for the Union of India, had vehemently argued before SC that the integrity of the investigating officer cannot be doubted as there was enough material against each of the accused.“According to him [Mehta], the request to set up the Special Investigation Team (SIT) was completely against the cardinal criminal jurisprudence,” read the petition.The petition further stated that the Centre, Maharashtra state and an intervenor had opposed a court-monitored investigation or an SIT, claiming that “the investigation was being conducted responsibly and impartially by an officer of the rank of an assistant commissioner of police and the same was carried out under the supervision of a deputy commissioner of police and was being monitored by the joint commissioner of police who was of the rank of an additional director general.” The case was then being investigated by Pune police.The petition went on to state that once the Centre had then refused to exercise the powers available to transfer the case to NIA within 15 days, it could not have subsequently exercised the same, particularly when there was no change in circumstance in the real sense.The petition claimed that the only change that prompted the Centre to direct NIA to investigate the case was after the BJP-led government in Maharashtra was voted out of power, and a new government formed by the Maharashta Vikas Aghadi, comprising Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and the Indian National Congress (INC), was intending to constitute SIT to enquire into the circumstances that led to violence at Bhima-Koregaon.The petitioners claimed that no new statement was recorded or evidence was gathered by Pune police after it had filed a supplementary charge sheet on February 21, 2019. “Thus there was no new material that could have prompted the much delayed and curiously timed decision of the Central Government to transfer the investigation only after BJP lost power in the state,” claimed the petition.Meanwhile, the bench also heard the application of activist Sudha Bharadwaj, another accused in the Elgar Parishad case too. Bharadwaj, through senior advocate Yug Choudhary, has challenged the rejection of her interim bail application by a special court.After hearing the application, the court posted the hearing on Friday as copies of the petition were not served to all parties. Gadling and Dhawale were arrested in June 2018 and are currently lodged at the Taloja jail in Navi Mumbai.Apart from Gadling, Dhawale and Bharadwaj, the other arrested accused include Rona Wilson, Anand Teltumbde, Gautam Navlakha, Shoma Sen, Vernon Gonsalves, Varavara Rao and Arun Ferreira.They were booked under the stringent provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and other provisions of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/elgar-parishad-case-hc-asks-centre-nia-to-respond-after-plea-claims-probe-transfer-was-politically-motivated/story-cpnnbNWtus8Ya8o87KorzH.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||Mithibai College students unhappy over second-year results under new grading system||More than four months after undergraduate students of Mithibai College, Vile Parle, protested against the introduction of a new grading system claiming that the new system brought down their overall performance compared to the previous semesters. The college on Tuesday announced the results of second-year students based on the new system.Students claimed that the college implemented the new grading system – which it had introduced after becoming an autonomous institution – despite assurances from the management that the new pattern will be introduced in phases, starting with first-year students.Despite repeated attempts, college principal Rajpal Hande did not answer HT’s calls till the time of going to the press.“We are in a single integrated three-year course. So the administration can’t introduce new grading pattern without our consent. Changes to the grading system have left most students with lower grades, as compared to the previous semesters, and that is unacceptable, especially because it’s not our fault,” said a student.Earlier, many students had pointed out that their scores fell drastically in the previous semester after the college introduced a 10-point grading system, instead of the seven-point one followed by the University of Mumbai.After the second-year students received their results, the college informed students that while the institute’s academic council agreed to hold back the new grading system, at a governing council meeting on June 16, it was decided to continue with the new system. “All our attempts to touch base with the management are futile because no one is responding. Final-year students are worried now that their overall result will reflect low scores, as compared to previous years because of the new grading system,” said another student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mithibai-college-students-unhappy-over-second-year-results-under-new-grading-system/story-IILevQJ5OBAwToJlhtzBNO.html

In a statement released on Tuesday, Raut said that the Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company (MSEDCL) is not trying to “cheat” any consumer. “As meter-reading was not possible in April and May, consumers have received bills with the actual reading of the past three months. There has also been a revision in rates as approved by the Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission since April 1,” Raut said, adding that MSEDCL has also faced losses worth ₹3,500 crore in the absence of physical reading. “Consumers can pay the amount in instalments; we will not cut power supply in any case,” he added.A senior official from MSEDCL said that consumers can visit the website https://billcal.mahadiscom.in/consumerbill/ to check all the information pertaining to their bill. “If consumers are still not convinced, then they can visit their respective sub-division to seek clarity over the bill and to avail easy instalments,” the official said. Despite complaints by consumers across the state, distribution companies maintained that there was been no error on their part and that there has been an increase in power usage owing to summer and lockdown, with most people at home and the meter-reading suspended. MSEDCL supplies power to 2.30 crore people in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/you-can-pay-power-bills-in-instalments-maharashtra-energy-minister-tells-consumers/story-wO2DXL0DSR5ceCzAr3rQ5N.html

CM said that the state is working on a policy under which green industries will be allowed to start immediately and will not have to wait for permissions. Thackeray organised an interactive session with representatives from private equity firms to understand their difficulties and the changes which the state can implement to attract more investors.“The economic cycle started rolling. To attract more investment, we decided to adopt industry-friendly policy. We already dropped unnecessary permissions and will be reducing them even further. We are also planning to simplify the entire process. Moreover, green industries will not need many permissions and they will be allowed to start their operations as early as possible,” Thackeray said during the interaction.Industries minister Subhash Desai said the state has already reduced the number of permissions to 25 from the earlier 76, and will welcome more suggestions from the industry. Facing economic crisis due to pandemic, Maharashtra is set to roll out the red carpet to attract investment. The state planned to provide ‘Maha Parwana’, a master permission for new industrial units, within 48 hours of application, so that industries need no other permission and can start construction on the site immediately. The master permission will guarantee that all statutory permissions required to start operations will be delivered within a prescribed schedule (from three to 30 days), or else it will be considered a deemed approval. The policy is likely to be cleared soon.Manish Kejriwal, managing partner, Kedaara Capitals; Sanjay Nayar, chief executing officer, KKR India; Amit Chandra, managing director, Bain Capital; and Vishal Mahadevia, managing director, Warburg Pincus also attended the interaction.Amit Dixit, senior managing director, Blackstone, suggested that the state should working on starting Pharma and Electronics Park in Maharashtra, said a senior official present in the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/green-industries-will-be-allowed-to-start-immediately-maharashtra-cm/story-4W4TntL97IXAhZjce7EpJM.html

The incident happened last year but the case was filed only on June 19 after the trader approached the police. The complainant, Anmol Shinde, is a Koparkhairane resident, who runs a fruit business at Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) market in Vashi. Last year in April, Shinde visited Pune. While he tried paying the farmers through net-banking, he realised that ₹2.75 lakh was missing from his account.“I then returned to Navi Mumbai and went to my bank, where I discovered that the amount was withdrawn in 13 transactions from a Thane ATM on April 21. Most of the transactions were of ₹20,000,” Shinde stated in his complaint.According to the police, the complainant filed a dispute form in the bank. The matter was taken up recently and the bank required a copy of the first information report (FIR) in the case, owing to which the complainant approached the police recently.“It appears to be a case of card cloning where the money was withdrawn from an ATM using the trader’s cloned debit card. Following the complaint, an FIR was registered against an unknown person for cheating,” said an officer from Koparkhairane police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/fruit-seller-in-navi-mumbai-loses-2-75-lakh-in-suspected-card-cloning-case/story-iHq11ea8pWIqTeuYxn9T0I.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||Bhansali Productions moves Bombay HC to restrain Eros International from exploiting rights of Bajirao Mastani||Filmmaker Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s production house has approached the Bombay high court (HC), seeking separate restraining orders against production and distribution company Eros International Media Ltd from exploiting the rights of the 2015 film Bajirao Mastani and 2013 film Goliyon ki Rasleela Ram-Leela. The move comes after HC directed Eros International to pay Bhansali Productions the amounts due for the Ram-Leela movie within three weeks on May 4. On Tuesday, when both petitions came up for hearing, the court held that as a substantial question of law was involved and the petitions needed to be heard extensively, it was adjourning the cases and would hear them on June 30. The bench of justice BP Colabawalla, while hearing the petitions, was informed by senior counsel Zal Andhyarujina and advocates Nausher Kohli and Parag Khandhar, that Bhansali Productions was challenging the intimation filed by Eros International with the Bombay Stock Exchange, that it was going into an all-share merger with its parent company Eros International PLC and Hollywood’s STX Filmworks.Bhansali’s advocates said that as neither Eros International PLC nor STX Filmworks was party to the co-production agreement between Bhansali Productions and Eros International Limited, they could not claim or exploit the rights of films made by the two together. Advocate Akshay Patil for Eros International, however, opposed the petition. In the earlier hearing on May 4, the bench of justice Colabawalla had observed that as the respondent companies are situated in the British Isles and California, it would require a detailed hearing to consider the law on whether reliefs could be granted against entities beyond the court’s jurisdiction. “I do not think that a case for ad-interim reliefs is made out at this stage, considering that the court is hearing only extremely urgent matters due to the Covid-19 pandemic,” said justice Colabawalla while directing Eros International Media to pay dues of ₹19.39 lakh to Bhansali Productions, related to the co-production agreement between the two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/bhansali-productions-moves-bombay-hc-to-restrain-eros-international-from-exploiting-rights-of-bajirao-mastani/story-ID5v9MK7zZn3xTGnqbJMmO.html

24-06-2020||Chandigarh||Haryana farmers choose cotton over paddy||Cotton cultivation tops the preference of Haryana farmers who have opted for the financial incentive-linked crop diversification drive of the Manohar Lal Khattar-led BJP-JJP coalition government.The key objective behind encouraging farmers to choose alternative crops is to reduce area under paddy, cultivation of which is being blamed for a sharp dip in groundwater table of Haryana.The state produces nearly 68 lakh metric tonne (LMT) paddy, including more than 25 LMT basmati, sown on about 32 lakh acres of land. For the first time, the farmers switching over to an alternative crop in place of paddy will be paid Rs 7,000 per acre incentive. Since the ‘Mera Pani, Meri Virasat’ policy was launched in the first week of May, nudging farmers to shift to less water-consuming crops, as many as 82,693 farmers of 22 districts have opted for this scheme (till June 22) and committed to diversifying 84,649 hectare land, states the official data. According to additional chief secretary, agriculture, Sanjeev Kaushal, at the heart of making this ambitious scheme attractive are a range of swift and bold policy decisions made by chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar.Of the 82,693 farmers, who have registered themselves on the ‘Mera Pani, Meri Virasat’ portal, over 39,000 farmers have decided to grow cotton in 44,822 hectares instead of paddy. The alternatives these farmers have opted include maize (9,695 hectares), bajra (17,662 hectares), cotton (44,822 hectares), pulses (1,188 hectares) and horticulture activity on 11,280 hectares.At least 9,032 farmers of eight paddy-rich blocks, including Ratia (Fatehabad), Siwan and Guhla (Kaithal), Pipli, Shahbad, Babain and Ismailabad (Kurukshetra) and Sirsa, where the depth of groundwater level exceeds 40 metre, have also opted for this scheme.The policy ‘advises’ the farmers of these eight blocks to diversify more than 50% land that was under paddy cultivation last year to become eligible for Rs 7,000 per acre incentive.Jai Prakash Dalal, agriculture and farmers’ welfare minister, said farmers were being encouraged to avoid planting paddy in areas where the groundwater level had gone below 40 metre. In order to attract farmers towards ‘Mera Pani, Meri Virasat’ scheme, he said, the state government has decided to give subsidy on agricultural equipment for sowing of kharif crops as well. “Farmers will have to apply online to avail the grant by June 30,” he added.Whether the farmers have actually stopped paddy cultivation in line with the commitment they have made is a subject matter of physical verification that is now underway.Till June 22, the committees constituted for physical verification had verified 2,137 hectares in 16 districts as the paddy transplantation began on June 15. The real picture of the success or otherwise of the diversification drive will get clear by the end of July when the physical verification of the land would end. “The CM has personally been monitoring the progress of this scheme,” Kaushal said, praising farmers for taking the initiative and the agriculture department staff for working ‘very hard’ despite the challenges Covid-19 outbreak posed.While the maximum number of farmers (8,543) opting for this scheme is from Jind district, the district with least takers is Mahendergarh where 85 farmers have come forward to diversify 92 hectares. 232 farmers chose this scheme in Kurukshetra. Fatehabad, Jhajjar, Palwal and Karnal are among the districts where more than 5,000 farmers each have accepted this policy.The state government has promised the farmers opting for diversification that it will procure maize and cotton under the minimum support price (MSP).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/haryana-farmers-choose-cotton-over-paddy/story-qry1Rn4iT6wFgpLJ7EZFzJ.html

The plea stated that despite HC’s suspension and inquiry orders against four police personnel allegedly involved in the case, a committee recommended their reinstatement, which is in contempt of the court.A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Abhay Ahuja, while hearing the contempt petition through video conferencing, was informed by advocate Chetan Mali that Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh and principal secretary (special) home department Amitabh Gupta were in contempt of a HC order of April 7, 2004. Mali said that the HC order had observed that assistant police inspector Sachin Hindurao Vaze and three other police constables, Rajendra Tiwari, Rajaram Nikam and Sunil Desai, were prima facie found to be involved in the custodial death of Khwaja Yunus they should be suspended, and an immediate state disciplinary inquiry should be initiated against them.Mali further submitted that despite the order, no disciplinary inquiry was conducted against any of the four accused. On the contrary, the review committee headed by the commissioner of police recommended the revocation of the suspension and reinstatement of the four accused. Mali said this amounted to “wilful contempt and disobedience of the orders high court”.In light of these submissions, Mali sought the cancellation and setting aside of the June 5 order of the review committee, and punishment or fine for Singh and Gupta for contempt and compliance of the April 2004 order of the HC.After hearing the submissions the court asked the state, Singh and Gupta to respond to the petition and posted the hearing on July 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/contempt-petition-filed-by-khwaja-yunus-s-mother-in-hc-against-mumbai-police-chief-and-principal-secretary/story-EswVaM2XPyf5s6ZY6QJrQN.html

People have started coming to negotiate and discuss the expenses, but they are still not sure on the number of guests and their wedding dates. I’ve fixed charges like electricity, gardening, security, cleaning and other government expenses that have to be paid. But currently, there is no source of income,” Yuvraj, who hails from Karnal, said.“We too have started to mull over the revision of our rates to make it affordable for families to at least start investing and a cycle could kick off. We are also ready to offer the hall and lawn divided into two to three portions for smaller gatherings, but clients are still not sure of dates,” he added.Puneet Dang, president of an association representing banquet hall owners, said, “Clients are opting for smaller hotels rather than booking sprawling lawns with proper catering services. We cannot replace them, but can modify our setups.”In Yamunanagar, the municipal corporation (MC) in its order earlier this month had asked owners of several such establishments to prepare for the worst and make room for at least 100 beds for isolation purpose. Jagmohan Singh of Aman Palace on Workshop Road in Yamunanagar said, “Even after the government has allowed such functions to take place with multiple riders, there are no bookings at all. No one is ready to rent big spaces for a gathering of just 50 people. On the MC’s order, we all ready to support the administration and contribute in whatever way we can.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/hit-hard-by-pandemic-banquets-marriage-palaces-in-ambala-y-nagar-struggle-to-survive/story-q1HNjkYfMhM5YyluIU5ccP.html

24-06-2020||Chandigarh||After 9,400 infections in 28 days, Haryana to toughen prevention tactics||With the virus spreading faster than ever, Haryana government is looking at ways to make containment measures more effective and stringent, particularly in the three national capital region (NCR) districts of Gurugram, Faridabad and Sonepat.The state has seen a steep hike in number of coronavirus cases in the past 28 days, reporting 9,451 infections from May 25 to June 21. More than 70% of the active cases pertain to the said three districts.Top officials said as a part of the intensive efforts to control the virus spread, the Standard Q Covid-19 antigen detection test, recommended by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), will be done in those containment zones which have thrown up higher number of cases. The antigen test is a promising tool for quick diagnosis of Covid-19 infection and is different from the rapid antibody test.“Containment zones having 50 cases per square kilometre would definitely qualify for the antigen detection test. The test can be done on site and results are available in about 30 minutes,” an official revealed.“Intensive door-to -door surveillance, antigen detection test, stricter containment, including isolating people who are not Covid-19 positive but have to go out of the zone for work, are among a few measures we are pondering over,” the official added.The district administrations are in the process of identifying hotspots in the containment zones. The government will make an announcement two to three days before commencing the intensive antigen detection tests in various containment zones.“For instance, Sonepat has 275 containment zones, Faridabad has 145 and Gurugram has 98. We have realised that all these zones would not qualify as hotspots. So, there is a need to review them as well,” the official said.The ICMR has recommended that the antigen detection test, performed onsite, should be done under strict medical supervision. All symptomatic influenza-like illness cases and asymptomatic direct and high-risk contacts with comorbidities of a confirmed case should be tested once between Day 5 and Day 10 of coming into contact. As per ICMR, a positive antigen detection test should be considered as a true positive whereas all symptomatic individuals testing negative through the rapid antigen test should be confirmed with a real-time PCR test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/after-9-400-infections-in-28-days-haryana-to-toughen-prevention-tactics/story-SLw1dC2eyE65l4AmLdRBWK.html

He had been in contact with the ISI sleuths through social media platforms. His handlers were yet to give him the target,” said a senior police official privy to the investigation.He said, “Some Khalistani supporters in Pakistan are helping the ISI in targeting Punjab’s youth, especially those with humble background.

24-06-2020||Chandigarh||Random sampling off target in Amritsar’s containment zones||The health department has failed to achieve the target of random sample collecting for Covid-19 testing in the Amritsar city’s two containment zones, with officials blaming the residents’ reluctance to get tested for fear of being admitted to hospital.As per the Punjab government’s guidelines, 10% of the population in a containment zone must be tested to check whether there is community transmission in the area. But of more than 15,300 residents in the city’s two containment zones, only 400 swab samples (2.5%) have been collected till date.In the district’s first containment zone comprising Katra Moti Ram, Katra Parja and Bombay Wala Khoo that have a population of 10,000, only 250 samples were collected in the last 15 days. In the second containment zone comprising Katra Khazana where 5,300 people reside, only 150 samples were collected in the last 10 days.The district, which has been put in the ‘red-zone’ category, has recorded 831 Covid-19 cases, including 32 deaths.Civil surgeon Dr Jugal Kishore said, “Teams of senior doctors and accredited social health activists (ASHAs) visiting the containment zones educate the residents about the testing and treatment process, but to no avail. Most people refuse to give their samples thinking their family members will also be taken to hospital if they are found positive.”Dr Mandeep Sandhu, who is assigned with sample collection from containment zones, said, “First, people do not visit the sample collection centre in their areas. Today, we could only collect 6 samples despite our best efforts to persuade several residents.”“We are trying to achieve the target. We will now start door-to-door sample collection. A mobile testing van will soon be given to the health department for this,” said additional deputy commissioner Himanshu Aggarwal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/random-sampling-off-target-in-amritsar-s-containment-zones/story-UW1xlnldUAAX6E2nsFWQAK.html

The skinners have lifted nearly 70 carcasses and dumped them outside the city.The strike had started affecting the city residents adversely.

24-06-2020||Chandigarh||Fresh show-cause notices issued to 79 Chandigarh’s private schools||The fee regulatory body of Chandigarh has issued fresh show-cause notices to all 79 private schools of the city, district education officer Alka Mehta said on Tuesday.The schools have been asked to send compliance reports before July 4 regarding uploading of balance sheets online, along with the undertaking that they charged only a tuition fee for the last academic year.This is the second round of mass show-cause notices issued to the schools for non-compliance of the provisions of the Punjab Regulation of Fee of Unaided Educational Institutions Act, 2016. Previously on May 26, 51 private unaided schools of Chandigarh were asked to explain their position within seven working days.SOME SCHOOLS ISSUED TWO NOTICESThe notices were issued by the DEO, who is also the member-secretary of the fee regulatory body. “Some schools have been issued two show-cause notices, first to upload the balance sheet online and the other one to comply with the directions regarding charging of only tuition fees. We have also asked schools to clarify that they have not increased the fees.”Hindustan Times accessed the copy of the notices that read, “The schools still failed to comply with the instructions of the fee regulatory body and contravened the provision of act despite so many notices and reminders.”The notice further demanded that a compliance report regarding the provisions of the act be sent before July 4, categorically stating that “no further chance will be given and the matter will be submitted to the fee regulatory body for the penalty.”The standoff between the UT education department and private schools started when the UT directed the schools to defer the collection of school fees during the lockdown period. The schools,however, ignored the directive saying they won’t be paying salaries to their staff unless they were allowed to collect fees. Later, invoking the fee regulation act, Mehta asked the schools to upload their balance sheets online.VIOLATING ACT PROVISIONS A PUNISHABLE OFFENCEAs per the Act, which was notified in 2018 in Chandigarh, if any school contravenes the provisions, it shall be punished with a fine between ₹60,000 to ₹4 lakh depending on the number of violations and the level of school (primary, middle, secondary).HS Mamik, president, Independent Schools Association (ISA), said, “The matter is subjudice and the education department should be patient and await the decision instead of issuing notices.”“It seems that the department has extended the vacations in government schools and hence, is free to spite the private schools by sending notices,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/fresh-show-cause-notices-issued-to-79-chandigarh-s-private-schools/story-Y7PAoRWAd1XSlO71kX4aPP.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||Disclose steps taken to convert railway coaches into isolation facilities: HC to Centre||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the central government to file an affidavit, indicating the steps taken by the Western Railway (WR) and Central Railway (CR) to convert coaches into isolation or quarantine centres. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice MS Karnik also asked the Centre to respond why intensive care unit (ICU) facilities in coaches were not considered necessary. The bench has given a week’s time for the Centre to file the affidavit.The court was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by activist Naresh Kapoor, complaining about the shortage of beds for treatment of Covid-19 and non-Covid patients across the city. He also alleged that the “inefficient management” of the coronavirus outbreak has resulted in the complete breakdown of the healthcare system within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region, amid the alarming rate at which the Covid-19 cases were rising.The court, however, rejected the petitioner’s prayer for a direction to order the state and civic authorities to reopen all hospitals, nursing homes and dispensaries, which have been closed either due to departmental orders or judicial orders, to meet the needs of patients who have been tested positive for Covid-19 as those suffering from other ailments.The bench said it has been noticed in the decision of another case that facilities for treating Covid-19 as well as non-Covid patients presently at the disposal of the state and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) were not that insufficient so as to call for an order to reopen closed hospitals, nursing homes and dispensaries.“Further, granting the prayer would amount to tinkering with administrative or judicial orders. Such course is plainly impermissible,” said the bench.The judges felt that opening up more facilities should be best left to the executive and if the situation so demands, the state or the corporation, keeping in mind the medical protocol required at the moment, may explore ways and means to make more facilities available at its disposal, other than reopening such closed facilities.With regards to Kapoor’s plea for rapid antigen detection test for Covid-19, advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni informed the court that the Maharashtra health department has approved the use of Standard Q Covid-19 Ag detection kits, which can detect presence of Sars-Cov-2 antigens in a patient in 15 to 30 minutes.The court has now posted Kapoor’s PIL for further hearing on July 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/disclose-steps-taken-to-convert-railway-coaches-into-isolation-facilities-hc-to-centre/story-Whu9q3l2RYdAHMuaDPBtCN.html

24-06-2020||Mumbai||AI increases frequency of domestic flights to help stranded citizens||People stranded in Mumbai, wanting to fly back to Hyderabad, Cochin, Kolkata, Bhopal, Rajkot, Tirupati and Vishakhapatnam, now have more options, as the national carrier- Air India has increased the frequency of flights to these cities.Air India announced the additional frequencies of flights on the social media networking site, Twitter, on Monday night. “We are adding more flights gradually, to enhance the air connectivity for the convenience of passengers,” said an Air India official. However, the airline spokesperson remained unavailable for comment. Mumbai-Hyderabad-Mumbai and Mumbai-Bhopal-Mumbai routes will see additional flights on Mondays; Mumbai-Kolkata-Mumbai will see additional flight for four days – Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and Sundays. Similarly, Mumbai-Rajkot-Mumbai will have additional services added on Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays.While these additional flights have already been added by the airline, Mumbai-Cochin-Mumbai (on Wednesdays and Fridays) will be effective from Wednesday, June 24 and Mumbai-Tirupati-Visakhapatnam-Mumbai (on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays) will be effective from Thursday, June 25.Apart from these, the frequency of flights have increased from Delhi to Bengaluru, Indore, Ranchi and Coimbatore and Bengaluru-Chandigarh-Bengaluru and Hyderabad-Vishakhapatnam-Hyderabad routes.Mumbai airport, that was allowed to operate only 25 departing and 25 arriving flights from May 25 as per state government’s restrictions, was permitted to double the flight operations. On Monday, June 15, Mumbai’s Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj International Airport (CSMIA) was permitted to operate 100 domestic commercial flights. The airline, however, took time to increase the frequency of flights to and from CSMIA. While June 16 saw 52 flight movements, 55 flights operated on June 17.“The airlines have slowly increased their flights to and from CSMIA. June 23 flight plan saw 98 flights listed to be operating to and from Mumbai airport,” said a CSMIA official. The six main airlines: Air India, IndiGo, Vistara, SpiceJet, GoAir and Air Asia India, TruJet and Alliance Air, too, have commenced their flights from the city airport.“Flights from Mumbai have been added not only due to slot availability, but also due to demand from sectors from the city,” an Air India official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ai-increases-frequency-of-domestic-flights-to-help-stranded-citizens/story-UFzFJ6RawvOuBcuQfH0BoJ.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||67,000 recovered in Maha, only 180 donated plasma||Only 180 of the 67,000 patients who recovered from Covid-19 in the state have come forward to donate blood for the convalescent plasma therapy (CPT), according to the authorities. Doctors say they are struggling to arrange for donors for CPT trials as 90% patients, who promise to return for blood donation, refuse after being contacted. Individuals infected with Sars-CoV-2 develop antibodies as part of the body’s immune response to the foreign pathogen. The antibodies invade pathogens and work to eliminate the virus in patients. During CPT, these antibodies are infused into the blood of Covid-19 patients to help them fight the virus. On Monday, the number of recovered patients in the state was 67,706, the highest in India. Doctors attributed the low number of donors to fear of contracting the infection again and lack of awareness about the therapy. Many patients provide wrong contact numbers during the time of discharge. “When patients are contacted 21 days after discharge, at least 90% refuse to donate blood. People are selfish because they forget about other patients after their recovery. They are busy criticising doctors, but they don’t play their part,” said Dr Mohan Joshi, in-charge of Nair Hospital. At Nair hospital, 50 patients have donated blood.Recently, the Medical Education and Drugs Department (MEDD) got approval to start clinical trials across Maharashtra to assess the efficacy of plasma therapy in treatment of Covid-19 patients. Twenty-one government medical colleges will take part in the trial. It will include city’s premier medical colleges— KEM, Sion, Nair and Cooper hospitals.“In the randomised open trial, 500 patients would be given plasma from recovered patients. It will be the world’s largest clinical trial on plasma therapy,” said Dr Sanjay Mukherjee, secretary of MEDD. It is not scientifically proven that plasma therapy can cure Covid-19, but is being used as an experimental procedure for treatment. Many countries like the US, China and Spain, Turkey, South Korea, Italy, the United Kingdom are using CPT as a stopgap measure. The broader criteria for donors is they should have complete resolution of symptoms for at least 21 days or three weeks prior to donation and should not be suffering from any transmissible or chronic disease. Those aged 18 to 60, with weight above 50kg, haemoglobin level at 12.5 g/dL and above and blood pressure and body temperature in the normal range are deemed fit for donation.Patients from the city who have not been approached but are keen to donate plasma can contact the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s helpline number 1916. Dr Muralidhar Tamble, medical superintendent of BJ Medical College, Pune, which was the first medical college to get approval, said they are trying to reach recovered patients through social media.“Not all interested donors qualify for donations. They have to go through tests, and many often fail. As it is for a good cause, I request patients to donate their blood and help us in the trial,” said Tamble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/67-000-recovered-in-maha-only-180-donated-plasma/story-6EFnRbhpXMJWojosAiMStM.html

He met civic commissioner Vijay Singhal to take stock of the situation in Thane city on Tuesday afternoon. Singhal refuted all allegations.Somaiya alleged: “I had asked the civic authority to provide me the latest figure, although I am not satisfied with the figures given by the authority. The Thackeray government had hid 3,000 deaths, of which they admitted after reconciliation that 1,500 were not shown in the data. The Solapur Municipal Corporation also tried to hide 40 deaths on Monday. Of the total deaths hidden by the government, 2,000 are from Mumbai and at least 50 are from Thane city.”Somaiya claimed Mumbra had a bigger problem. “The corporation has merely shown 50% of the actual deaths in Mumbra. We have demanded an inquiry into these discrepancies. Moreover, patients are sent to private hospitals increasingly, instead of the government hospital in Thane, leading to profit for private hospitals. There are also technical issues such as lack of oxygen supply or ventilators,” he alleged.Pravin Darekar, leader of Opposition in the Maharashtra legislative Council, also met Kalyan Dombivli municipal commissioner Vijay Suryavanshi on Tuesday. He said, “Environment Minister Aditya Thackeray’s Worli constituency has been considered as a special case whereas hotspots of Thane, Kalyan and Dombivli continue to be neglected. If the situation does not come under control in the next eight days, we shall protest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/thane-civic-body-too-has-hid-covid-19-deaths-somaiya/story-MVJFwDp5lg1vbtuOYddw5M.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||Lower Parel ward office gets foot-operated lift buttons, UV box disinfectant to fight Covid||The G (South) ward office in Lower Parel has devised innovative ways to ensure the safety of its employees and visitors during the Covid-19 outbreak. The ward has installed foot-operated devices to operate elevators, water dispensers, washbasins and toilet flushes to minimise virus transmission from these surfaces. In addition to the foot-operated devices, the officials’ cabins in the ward have been covered with transparent acrylic sheets that act as a shield to prevent the possible transmission of Covid-19. To sanitise handbags and documents brought to the office, there is an ultraviolet (UV) rod and UV box disinfectant. The ward has also installed automatic disinfectants in five public toilets in Worli, which disinfect the toilets at regular intervals.These innovative ideas have been implemented on a pilot basis in the ward, which has jurisdiction over Worli, Prabhadevi and Lower Parel. Sharad Ughade, assistant municipal commissioner of G (South) ward, said, “These ideas were pitched by our civic engineers and other officials in one of the brainstorming sessions that we keep conducting in our office. The idea was to ensure minimal physical or direct contact with the staff and at the same time, ensuring protection for individuals who visit the office.”Most of these devices were introduced using corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds and the remaining were from funds allocated to the ward.Ughade said as a pilot, these methods have been proven successful and will be implemented across the ward. “We are trying our best to make these methods cost-effective. Otherwise, there will be difficulty in implementing them. Further, we are ensuring that there is minimal file movement physically and sanitisation of the same. The automatic disinfectant in toilets will be implemented in public and community toilets across the ward.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/lower-parel-ward-office-gets-foot-operated-lift-buttons-uv-box-disinfectant-to-fight-covid/story-knkJui0GNx3iapV6HHG62L.html

Chief minister of Maharashtra Uddhav Thackeray wanted to talk to him.Forty-four-year-old Chavan is a resident of Jogeshwari and has been working at St George’s Hospital since 2009. While the state has exempted the physically-impaired from reporting to work, Chavan takes two buses to come into work at the hospital in Fort. “I co-ordinate to arrange for ambulances, connect calls to the right department. So many relatives call these days. They are scared, confused, not knowing what to do. I try to help them,” said Chavan, who works from 10am to 6pm. The night shift is manned by Mira Road resident Sandeep Shinde, who is physically-challenged. Neither Shinde nor Chavan have taken leave over the past two months.When Thackeray spoke to Chavan on Monday, he appreciated Chavan’s work and told Chavan he is an inspiration to others, especially since Chavan is visually impaired. “It was like getting a certificate for my work. That too from the most important man in the state,” said Chavan. He said he hadn’t considered taking leave during the lockdown. “This is the time we have to work for society, which has given us so much. Every time I leave my house, someone helps me cross the road, someone helps me reach the bus stop. This is the time to show that we are also an equal part of the society,” said Chavan, adding that he has received a lot of support from all the doctors and nurses in the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/cm-salutes-visually-impaired-hospital-staff-terms-him-an-inspiration/story-8rMZZHfU1KjyokIavttPZP.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||Ajit Pawar indicates Covid cases may surge in July, August||Deputy chief minister (DyCM) Ajit Pawar on Tuesday indicated that there could be a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases in July and August. He also urged people to be cautious while stepping out of their homes as not following social distancing norms could lead to more trouble. “It’s been more than three months since the pandemic hit Maharashtra. July and August are likely to be more difficult. If people don’t take enough precautions, we will be inviting more trouble. I appeal to the public to follow all norms such as wearing face masks, maintaining social distancing, etc. We will have to face the consequences if there’s any laxity,” said Pawar while addressing media persons at the headquarters of the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) in south Mumbai.Maharashtra has reported the maximum number of Covid-19 positive cases and deaths in the country at 1,35,796 and 6,283 respectively.Pawar also said that the government has launched a probe into the complaints of missing Covid-19 patients in Mumbai. “Following complaints, an investigation has been started. Data with government hospitals is easily available but Mumbai is a big city and also has lots of private hospitals. They are supposed to share this data, which sometimes is not done,” he said.The DyCM also urged people to boycott Chinese-made products amid a tense stand-off along the disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15 that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.“Action must be initiated against such a country [China]. I would urge the public to boycott goods manufactured by Chinese firms. China will be shown its place if India, a country with a population of over 125 crore, starts boycotting Chinese goods,” said Pawar, who holds the finance ministry portfolio in the Uddhav Thackeray-led coalition government.On Monday, Maharashtra industries minister Subhash Desai had said in a statement that the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) – a three-party coalition government comprising the Shiv Sena, NCP, and Congress – has decided to temporarily put on hold the memorandum of understanding (MoU) worth ₹5,020 crore recently signed with three Chinese companies.The MoUs, worth ₹5,020 crore, were signed with Hengli Group (₹250 crore), Great Wall Motors (₹3,770 crore) and PMI Electro Mobility Solutions, a joint venture with Foton (₹1,000 crore).“We have decided to put the MoUs signed with the three Chinese firms, worth ₹5,020 crore, on hold. However, this doesn’t mean they have been cancelled. We will be waiting for a clear policy from the Central government on this issue,” Desai had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/ajit-pawar-indicates-covid-cases-may-surge-in-july-august/story-U9x4k7ZTwwiVMDPmYbWzRI.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||Rising cases in MMR: Four civic chiefs shunted out||In a bid to contain the spread of Covid-19, the state government has appointed new district chiefs and civic commissioners. Four of them selected for posts in the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) are Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officers with medical degrees.The state transferred commissioners of Thane. Mira-Bhayander, Ulhasnagar, and Navi Mumbai municipal corporations on Tuesday and appointed Dr Vipin Sharma, Dr Vijay Rathod, Dr Mantada Raja Dayanidhi, and Abhijit Bangar to the posts, respectively. Sharma (2005 IAS batch), Rathod and Dayanidhi (both 2014 batch IAS) hold MBBS degrees. On June 19, the government had appointed Pankaj Ashiya (2016 batch IAS), an MBBS graduate, as commissioner of Bhiwandi-Nizampur Municipal Corporation. Late on Tuesday, Vijay Singhal was shunted out from the post of Thane civic commissioner three months after his appointment. Sharma, who was on foreign training since September 2019, will now take up the post.Sharma had previously served as additional civic commissioner in Pune and collector of Latur. Ashiya has been credited with playing a key role in controlling the cases in Malegaon in Nashik and then in Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) over the past three months. He was the special monitoring officer for Covid-19 in Malegaon and will now take over charge as Bhiwandi civic chief from Pravin Ashtikar.“My team could manage to bring the active cases of coronavirus in Malegaon from 500-600 to 60-70. In Thane also, I was assisting the commissioner for five wards which had the highest cases, in terms of tracking the contacts, improving health infrastructure. In Bhiwandi, I will study the present scenario and work towards reducing the spread of the infection,” said Ashiya.“In any pandemic situation, the best way to control the spread is by following the guidelines set by the government. In Malegaon, we managed to involve locals and community leaders to spread awareness. The same shall be done in Bhiwandi,” he added.While the cases in Mumbai have dropped drastically in the past few weeks, the count is still high compared to the rest of MMR, which is governed by eight other municipal corporations. On June 21, MMR accounted for 73.3% of the state’s Covid count, a slight decrease from 78.13% on April 21. During this period, the percentage of cases in Mumbai dropped to 50.34% from 66.13%. The case fatality rate in MMR has increased to 4.69% from 3.01% since May 22.“We have brought IAS officers with medical degrees to lead municipal corporations that do not have robust health infrastructures like Mumbai or Navi Mumbai. We expect these officers with a medical background to be able to handle the pandemic situation properly. We don’t think the outgoing officers were not competent enough, but in the backdrop of gradual developments on the front of the pandemic, these officers will be in a better position to contain the spread,” said Sitaram Kunte, additional chief secretary, general administration department.The state government recently also replaced the Jalgaon collector and Solapur municipal commissioner after the cases and death rate in the districts rose significantly. The pandemic-period changes began with the transfer of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) commissioner, Praveen Pardeshi, six weeks ago. UMC gets new chief for second time during lockdownSameer Unhale, municipal commissioner of Ulhasnagar has been transferred, and Dayanidhi will take over the post. Unhale was made Ulhasnagar Municipal Corporation (UMC) chief a month ago after Sudhakar Deshmukh was transferred. Till now, Ulhasnagar has recorded 1,125 positive cases and 36 deaths. Dayanidhi was the chief operating officer, Gondia zilla parishad, and had been posted in Ulhasnagar as part of the state government’s pandemic team.According to an order released by Mantralaya on Tuesday, Dayanidhi has to take charge from Unhale at the earliest. Santosh Rastogi, joint commissioner (crime), Mumbai Police has also been transferred as additional resident commissioner, Maharashtra Sadan, Delhi.

24-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai inches towards 70K cases; fatality rate stays a big worry||With 68,410 cases and 3,844 deaths as of Tuesday, the city is inching towards the 70,000-case mark.While over the past 50 days, the city’s share in Maharashtra’s total cases has dipped by 18 percentage points, the growth rate remains 1,000 cases daily since May 16. According to experts, the biggest worrying factor, however, is the fatality rate.Mumbai accounted for 59% of the total deaths in Maharashtra on May 1, 55% on May 31 and 59% on June 22, showing a rise in the past 20 days, mainly owing to the 862 deaths added after the reconciliation of figures. The current fatality rate in Mumbai is 5.52%, and of the 3,737 deaths in the city, over 2,500 deaths were reported in the past 22 days.According to the state health department data, on April 22, Mumbai had 65% of the total cases in Maharashtra, which went to 67.89% on May 1, 60.42% on May 16, 58.65% on May 31 and 49.77% as of June 22. Going by the current trend of 1,200 cases daily, the city could have 77,000 cases until June 30, according to civic officials. By the end of July, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) hopes to have control over the situation, but remains sceptical about the rise.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said on Monday: “We are taking steps to ensure the cases and fatality rate go down. There is a separate category of suspected patients who are not positive, but have breathing issues. I have look at all such patients as suspected Covid-19 and allow walk-in admissions. We are testing them after stabilising them, and giving treatment as per requirement, if they test positive. This was the category where we brought down the fatality rate.”Since May 16, the city has been reporting cases between 1,000 and 1,700 daily, except on three occasions when the daily cases were below the 1,000 mark, one of them being Tuesday, when the city saw 824 new cases, with 107 deaths. In the past one week, BMC has been reporting cases between 1,000 and 1,400. The number of discharged patients was 34,576 on Tuesday, with a recovery rate of 50%. The number of active cases stood at 29,982. The fatality rate in the city as of Saturday was 5.61%, followed by doubling rate at 38 days.A BMC official said, “We have ensured we have enough ambulances, beds, and timely delivery of laboratory reports while tracing, testing, quarantining and treating patients. When I joined on May 8, our growth rate was 8-9%, and today it is 2% because of these steps.”Chahal said on Monday: “By July, we expect the cases to be controlled, but this process of tracking, testing, quarantining and treating will have to go on until the vaccine arrives. When I joined, Mumbai had 14,000 cases and Delhi had 2,000 cases, and today we have around 65,000 cases and Delhi has around 55,000 cases. This means, we are in a much comfortable position today.” Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based private health consultant, said, “The number of cases is stable, and the curve is not showing a worrisome trend being developed. We need to work to reduce the fatalities. With over 800 deaths added last week, our mortality rate is above national average. Also, the case share of Mumbai in the state’s numbers has reduced, but the death share is almost the same.”Civic officials said they are trying to bring down the cases in the western and eastern suburbs. Starting Tuesday, BMC initiated its door-to-door survey in high-rises, slums and chawls in six wards as part of BMC’s Mission Zero. The plan covered Dahisar, Borivli, Kandivli, Malad, Mulund and Bhandup. BMC officials said these areas need to be brought under control to ensure the virus does not spread to south Mumbai once the relaxations are granted at a later stage.On Tuesday, Dharavi hit another low with only five new cases. BMC’s H-West ward that covers Bandra West, Khar West and Santacruz West and has a growth rate of 3% conducted a meeting with Advanced Local Management members who were asked to come forth as volunteers for screening residents and doctors with clinics along the roads. BMC has also asked for Covid-19 coordinators to be appointed for each area to help those needing a bed, testing or any other assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-inches-towards-70k-cases-fatality-rate-stays-a-big-worry/story-4ZwLZQVmfEMsWGsTO2jI5M.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||KEM Hospital completes trial of psoriasis drug||King Edward Memorial (KEM) Hospital at Parel has completed the trial of a repurposed drug Itolizumab, and the result will soon be published in a research journal. Ten severely-ill patients suffering from Covid-19 participated in the trial.Conventionally, Itolizumab is used to treat the skin condition psoriasis and was recommended by the state’s Covid-19 task force to reduce mortality. In the first week of May, the civic-run KEM Hospital started the trial with a 35-year-old male patient who was on the ventilator. Within three days of being administered the drug, the patient’s pneumonitis in the left lower zone improved, following which he was taken off the ventilator.“We have reported a good recovery rate among the 10 patients who opted for the trial. We, however, can’t disclose any further details. The results will be published in a science research journal soon with approval from the government,” said a senior officer from the hospital.Itolizumab is manufactured by Bengaluru-based biotech company Biocon, which has repurposed the drug for the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The drug is classified as a humanised anti-CD6 monoclonal antibody. It is a molecule produced in a laboratory. When it is incubated into the body, it acts as a substitute for antibodies that can restore or modulate the immune system’s attack on foreign bodies. “As the virus is new with no specific drugs for treatment, Itolizumab gives us hope,” said the officer.Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force has made several recommendations in the treatment of Covid-19 patients, intending to reduce mortality. The first was to make the drug Remdesivir and another antiviral drug Favipiravir available to patients. The task force has also suggested the availability of re-purposed arthritis drug Tocilizumab along with Itolizumab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/kem-hospital-completes-trial-of-psoriasis-drug/story-AdqErMHg0iZkgswbzFqJqI.html

24-06-2020||City||77-year-old dies as TMC assigns bed, but hospital refuses to take him in||Despite being assigned a bed in a Covid hospital by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC), a 77-year-old man died after the hospital refused to admit him, his family has alleged. The man’s family waited outside the hospital for almost two hours, by which time the patient succumbed, they alleged. The hospital has claimed that they did not have ventilators available to treat the man. TMC has set up a Covid war room to update the status of available beds in Covid hospitals and help patients reserve a bed, especially in case of emergency.The 77-year-old man was the father of a TMC employee. “My grandfather was admitted to a private hospital in Kopri as he had trouble breathing. After his test report came positive on Monday, the hospital asked us to shift him to a Covid hospital, so we got in touch with TMC’s war room. They informed us that a bed was reserved for him in Kalsekar Hospital,” said the man’s 23-year-old grandson.The Kopri hospital allowed the patient to stay till an ambulance arrived, and also provided oxygen. “The ambulance arrived in the evening and we went to Kalsekar Hospital in Mumbra. However, the hospital refused to admit him, claiming no bed was available. We called the war room and the mayor seeking help. We stood outside the hospital for at least two hours, as the guard had closed the gate and did not allow us in. We finally decided to go back to the Kopri hospital, however, my grandfather died on the way,” alleged the grandson.An official from TMC said that the hospital had given confirmation after which the patient was asked to shift. “We had got confirmation from the hospital and therefore, sent the patient there. The civic commissioner has set up an inquiry into the incident, and action will be taken.”Thane mayor Naresh Mhaske said strict action needs to be taken against hospitals that refuse to follow the directives of TMC. “We demand that a case of culpable homicide be registered against the hospital,” he said.Kalsekar Hospital management has claimed that they did not have ventilators available. Dr Afreen Saudagar, chief executive officer of the hospital, said, “We were informed at 6.40pm that a bed was needed, however, we were not told that the patient would need a heart bypass. The patient reached here at 11pm and needed a ventilator. We did not have any ventilator and could not admit him. We have submitted our report on the incident to the corporation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/77-year-old-dies-as-tmc-assigns-bed-but-hospital-refuses-to-take-him-in/story-KuyTcN44ijvt8zAyWK3QLM.html
24-06-2020||Chandigarh||Severed feet, foetus found dumped in bushes in Chandigarh’s Sector 17||Severed feet, suspected to be of a woman, and an aborted female foetus were found dumped in the bushes along a cycle track near the busy Press light point in Sector 17, Chandigarh, on Tuesday.Ajit Kishori, who is a manager at the State Bank of India (SBI)’s local head office in the Bank Square situated close to the spot, was walking on the cycle track after lunch when he spotted a chopped human foot wrapped in a newspaper. Police reached the spot on receiving his call and recovered another foot, also wrapped in a newspaper, as well as the foetus, wrapped in a polythene bag, from the bushes. Police said the severed feet were wrapped in an English newspaper, and there was no blood or sign of decomposition. An investigating official, on the condition of anonymity, said it seems the feet were severed with precision using a cutting machine two to three days back and might have been preserved in a freezer before disposal.The foetus, meanwhile, seems to have been aborted recently, said a police official.The recovered body parts along with the foetus have been sent to the mortuary at Government Multi Specialty Hospital, Sector 16, where the postmortem will be conducted on Wednesday.A case has registered under Section 318 (secretly burying or otherwise disposing of the dead body of a child) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). However, no FIR has yet been registered in the case of the severed feet. Police are also looking into the angle whether the feet were being used by medical students for their practical classes. Although, police have sought opinion of doctors, a cop privy to the case, said its chances are bleak. The police are also to ascertain whether the feet belong to the same person. The gender, too, will become clear after the postmortem, though initial investigations hint towards them belonging to a woman.“We have sent the feet as well as the foetus for postmortem. Further action will be taken only after getting the doctors’ opinion,” said Krishan Kumar, deputy superintendent of police, central.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/severed-feet-foetus-found-dumped-in-bushes-in-chandigarh-s-sector-17/story-ExbqKfbk96lmPaki0VyB5H.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||Citizens above 70 years of age can be tested without prescription: BMC||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Tuesday announced that citizens above the age of 70 irrespective of being symptomatic or not can get tested without a prescription, and that citizens can avail testing by private laboratories using e-prescriptions. The BMC decided this in order to ramp up testing and contain the spread of the coronavirus.The BMC also said it has decided to procure one lakh rapid antigen tests, a day after the government allowed it, under its “Mission Universal Testing”. According to BMC, the procurement of rapid antigen kits will enable around 2,000 to 2,500 additional tests daily. Currently, BMC is testing between 3,500 and 5,000 tests daily, however, with this decision, it expects to conduct an additional 2,000 to 2,500 more tests.The rapid antigen kits, called Standard Q Covid-19 Ag detection, provides results in only half-an-hour, which will help decide the further course of treatment for a serious patient at the earliest. It will also be used to know the prevalence of the pandemic among masses in hotspots and in western and eastern suburbs, where currently the growth rate is higher comparatively.In a statement issued on Tuesday, the BMC said, “While efforts to prevent coronavirus infection in Mumbai are succeeding, more aggressive measures are being taken without any hesitation and as a part of ‘Mission Universal Testing’. The BMC has decided to procure one lakh antigen testing kits that gives results in just half an hour. Corporate houses and private companies have also been advised to test their employees by purchasing rapid testing kits, as per the recent approval of the government.”In the context of procuring rapid antigen kits, the BMC statement added, “The procured kits will be used in all civic and government hospitals as well as treatment centres. This will speed the process of preventing infection by testing suspected cases immediately. We have also requested 35 large private hospitals in the Mumbai municipal corporation area to purchase and use these government -approved antigen test kits.”The decision was taken by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal, in a video conference called along with senior BMC officials. A BMC official who attended the meeting said, “This decision was in a way taken to conduct more aggressive testing. It is a decision to curb the spread considering we plan to open up gradually after more relaxations in existing lockdown norms are announced by the state government.”Meanwhile, the state health department on Monday had said, patients with severe coronavirus symptoms and comorbidities, and pregnant women, can be tested using rapid antigen testing kits by the municipal corporations and councils.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/citizens-above-70-years-of-age-can-be-tested-without-prescription-bmc/story-tmudbp3O2m4MURS3QYSJHI.html
24-06-2020||Mumbai||Mumbai sees lowest 1-day jump in cases since May 13||Maharashtra, the Indian state worst hit by the Covid-19 pandemic, on Tuesday reported its highest single-day jump in fatalities with 248 deaths, even as Mumbai, the worst-hit Indian city, recorded 824 new cases — lowest one-day jump in 41 days. Mumbai had reported 800 cases on May 13.One of the reasons for Mumbai’s improvement is Dharavi, which was once the biggest hotspot in the city, but on Tuesday recorded only five cases — its lowest since April 10. The average daily new cases in one of Asia’s largest slums were 47 in May, which went down to 18 in June. Dharavi’s doubling rate has gone up to 102 days, highest in the city.Of the state’s 248 deaths, 75 were reported in the last 48 hours, while the remaining were from the past few weeks. The state toll went up to 6,531 and the case fatality rate is 4.69%, according to the state data. Keeping its trend of more than 3,000 cases per day for the past week, the state recorded 3,214 new infections, taking the tally to 139,010, with 62,833 active cases. Mumbai’s tally went up to 68,410 and the toll is 3,844 with the addition of 107 fatalities on Tuesday. There are 29,982 active cases.Owing to the addition of 1,328 cases in a day as a result of reconciliation of data last Tuesday, the state toll jumped by 2,403 deaths in the past eight days. This resulted in the jump in the case fatality rate to 4.69% on Tuesday, from 3.79% on June 15. The positivity rate in the state has risen multi-fold over the past few weeks. It was 27.45% on Monday, up from 22.49% a month ago on May 22 and 6.06% on April 22. The positivity rate in Mumbai, too, has been at par with the state rate. From 8.67% on April 21, the positivity rate has increased to 27.9% on May 21 and 27.5% on June 21. Maharashtra has, so far, conducted 7.87 lakhs tests, including 2.92 lakh in Mumbai alone. Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and member of the expert committee appointed by the state to recommend steps to curb the spread said, “As per the ICMR guidelines, tests are being performed on the symptomatic cases and hence the rate naturally ought to be high. When the tests are done for all contacts, the positivity rate is low.”When asked if the high positivity rate is an indication of community transmission, Dr Supe said, “It is a controversial subject, some epidemiologists say it’s already begun, some say no. The possibility is high, but it is a matter of research by scientists and experts,” He said that though the case fatality rate is high, it is still within limits and barring a few areas the situation in Mumbai is improving. The positivity rate is the percentage of tests that turn out positive for coronavirus. The authorities said that since they have been testing only symptomatic patients, the rate is high. However, experts also pointed out that the high positivity rate also indicates that the state is only testing sick patients and not casting the net wide to know if the virus is spreading within communities. Of the 248 fatalities reported on Tuesday, 65 were in Mumbai, 42 in Solapur, 18 in Nashik and 15 in Aurangabad.605,141 people are currently home quarantined, while 26,572 are under institutional quarantine. State’s recovery rate, however, improved to 50,09% as 69,631 patients recovered till Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-lowest-1-day-jump-in-cases-since-may-13/story-Hx9jyJ1zGcbuEaFbAtaSAP.html

24-06-2020||Chandigarh||BJP leader Gosain accuses Debi of harassment, expresses fear for his life||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former health minister Sat Pal Gosain has accused his party colleague and treasurer of the state BJP Gurdev Sharma Debi of harassing him and expressed fear for his life from the latter. Gosain alleged he was under threat from Debi as he had spoken against his ‘illegal activities’ and also sought a CBI probe into his ‘murky business interests’. Gosain said, “Today, I met commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal and submitted a complaint that Debi is not transferring the car, which he had bought from him in his name, and also not handing over the registration documents of the land I had purchased from him, even though payment has been made to him.” “He was involved in gambling and other illegal activities and that is the reason why I fear for my life as I have spoken against Debi,” claimed Gosain.On the other hand, Debi termed the allegation baseless and said that Gosain and his sidekick councillor Gurdeep Singh Neetu, who left BJP and joined the Congress, were deliberately trying to malign his image. “I have never indulged in gambling. I am running a paint business and ready to face any investigation. Further, the car Gosain is talking about belongs to me. I have paid the money and the vehicle’s registry is also in my name. I sold my land to Gosain and already registered the land in the name of Gosain’s daughter-in-law. I don’t know why they are raking up the issue. I am being targeted as, during the assembly election in 2017, I was preferred over Gosain to fight the election,” said Debi. He said he would drag both Neetu and Gosain to the court. Sources in the BJP said that backlash took place two days after the BJP conducted a press conference where it alleged that the ‘dead’ were shown as beneficiaries in the distribution of ration sent by the central government for the poor in the area belonging to councillor Neetu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/bjp-leader-gosain-accuses-debi-of-harassment-expresses-fear-for-his-life/story-bzhlt39pnYsyJXz8RD9JlJ.html
24-06-2020||Delhi||Hospital guard in Delhi beaten up for ‘spreading coronavirus’||A security guard of GTB Hospital was injured after being assaulted with a brick by a neighbour who accused him of spreading the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in north-east Delhi’s Harsh Vihar, the police said on Tuesday.The security guard, 35-year-old Vijay Kumar, required multiple stitches in the head, but is out of danger and has been discharged from the hospital.Ved Prakash Surya, the deputy commissioner of police (north-east), said that the 24-year-old suspect, Vikas, has been arrested and booked for voluntarily causing hurt and wrongful restraint.Kumar lives with his family in B-block of Harsh Vihar and has been working as a security guard for the last three years at GTB Hospital, one of the designated Covid-19 hospitals.Though he performs his duty near the Covid ward of the hospital, he said that he never faced trouble from the patients and their relatives. “In my neighbourhood too, people never caused me any trouble. This is because there are at least three guards and two other staffers working at GTB Hospital from my neighbourhood,” Kumar said.His sister also works as a ward assistant at the same hospital.The alleged assault took place while Kumar was exercising on his terrace on Sunday evening, minutes before he was to leave for work. His terrace shares its boundary wall with that of his neighbour Vikas.In his statement to the police, Kumar said that Vikas asked him where he worked. “When I told him that I was a guard at GTB Hospital, Vikas told me that I worked at a ‘corona hospital’ and that I would spread the virus in the neighbourhood,” Kumar alleged.DCP Surya confirmed that Kumar’s allegation was related to his work at the hospital. “Vikas accused him of spreading the virus and told him to be careful,” the officer said.That led to a war of words between the two men and was allegedly followed up by Vikas and five-six of his friends barging into Kumar’s home and launching an attack that included hitting his head with a brick.But Vikas, who is out on bail, had a different sequence of events to narrate.“While Kumar was exercising, he was leaning against my terrace wall and risking its safety. When I told him to be careful, he threatened to infect me and get me admitted to the Covid ward of the hospital,” Vikas, a 24-year-old college student, said.Vikas said that it led to an abusive exchange and eventually a fight, in which he too was assaulted, but he struck back with a brick. Vikas denied that he had any problems with Kumar working at a Covid-designated hospital.The DCP said that further investigation would clear the actual sequence of events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/gtb-hospital-guard-beaten-up-for-spreading-coronavirus/story-KV3dJWwAwmWMEfM1hsSJNO.html
24-06-2020||Delhi||New 1,000-bed hospital in Delhi to be ready in next 10 days: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Tuesday said that a 1000-bed full-fledged hospital with 250 ICU beds -- being developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and Tata Trust -- would be ready in the next 10 days for the treatment of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients in Delhi.Shah made the announcement in a tweet, following up on his response to a news that Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had written to the home minister, requesting him to deploy nurses and doctors from the army and Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) at the 10,000-bed Covid care centre coming up at the Chhatarpur campus of spiritual organisation Radha Soami Satsang Beas. In his response on Twitter, Shah said, “Dear Kejriwal ji, It has already been decided in our meeting 3 days back and MHA has assigned the work of operating the 10,000-bed COVID Care Centre at Radha Swami Beas in Delhi to ITBP. The work is in full swing and a large part of the facility will be operational by 26th Jun.”In another tweet, the home minister said, “Armed Forces personnel have been detailed for providing medical care and attention to Covid patients housed in the railway coaches in Delhi. 8,000 additional beds have already been placed at Delhi government’s disposal for making Covid care centres, as per requirement.”Responding to Shah’s tweet, Kejriwal thanked the home minister. “The armed forces, doctors, NGOs, central government and Delhi government - all agencies are working together for Delhi. I believe, together, we shall defeat coronavirus. Thank you for helping the Delhi government and the people of Delhi in such trying circumstances.”Delhi on Tuesday reported 3,947 fresh cases and 68 deaths. With this, the total number of infections in the city has reached 66,602 and 2,301 people have succumbed to the viral disease. The Union home minister had held a series of meetings since June 14 with the Delhi government and the Delhi L-G on the city’s preparedness to treat and contain the coronavirus disease. Several important decisions, including ramping up testing in the capital, capping the testing price and door-to-door survey for tracing the patients and their contacts were taken in these meetings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/new-1-000-bed-hospital-in-delhi-to-be-ready-in-next-10-days-amit-shah/story-0mBxkQzOHIv3fK9eDWSJUN.html
24-06-2020||Delhi||Local volunteers being trained to look after community||The medical training of local volunteers to triage and manage mild cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) admitted to isolation facilities in neighbourhood community centres and marriage halls began in Delhi on Tuesday. As a pilot project, the government has started training the first batch of volunteers in New Delhi district’s Budh Nagar Colony. Over the next five days, these volunteers will be taught about human anatomy and to measure vital indicators such as pulse rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, hygiene and infection control practices, record keeping, and basic life support.These centres are for patients with mild to moderate symptoms who do not have adequate space in their homes to isolate themselves. The centres will have the provision to provide oxygen to the patients, according to officials.Under Delhi government guidelines, asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms can stay isolated at home if they have a separate room and bathroom. If not, they will be moved to either Covid Care Centres or Covid Health Centres. There are more than 6,000 beds at the existing centres, of which around 30% are occupied, according to data provided by the Delhi government.“The number of Covid-19 cases is increasing every day, so the government has decided to set up these small centres within the community, managed by the people from the community, for the people from the area. This is a pilot project, and if it is successful, then it will be implemented across Delhi. We train around 1,000 such volunteers in the district,” Dr Nitin Shakya, the nodal officer for Covid-19, New Delhi district, said.“The centres will be linked to nearby hospitals and there will be doctors available for tele-consultation,” he said.The volunteers have to between the ages of 18 and 55 and free of comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, heart or kidney disease. Anyone can sign up to volunteer through the Delhi government website.“We also carried out a door-to-door drive asking people to volunteer. Around 35 people showed up for the training session today. The number might increase later on; people are scared that they will get the disease. Even when we started doing the antigen testing, it was difficult to motivate people to get tested,” Jay Prakash, the chief coordinator from the office of the Sub Divisional Magistrate, Delhi Cantonment, said.Harish Arya, a driver who lost his job during the lockdown, was among those who attended the training session on Tuesday. “Initially, I had started donating food during the first lockdown and slowly got in touch with the district office, and have been volunteering with them ever since. I even helped motivate people who live in my area to get tested. I got myself and everyone in my family tested for Covid-19 as well. Today, the doctor taught us about all the parameters we had to monitor – most of it was easy like reading the temperature on the thermometer or blood pressure or oxygen machine,” he said.Homemaker Shakuntala Pande has also been helping the district authorities with various activities related to Covid-19 in the area. “I was informed that they will be starting centres for those who get sick in our community in some hall nearby. The officers asked me whether I wanted to help and I agreed. So, they asked me to come to the training today. A doctor taught us about the human body,” she said.The government is also working to add over 15,000 beds in makeshift hospitals for those with a severe infection in hotels and banquet halls. To staff these, the government is relying on doctors’ organisations.“This is like a war situation where, as a last resort, you train civilians to shoot and send them to the frontlines. We are also providing basic training so that they can take care of Covid-19 patients when there is a shortage of doctors, nurses,” said Prakash.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/local-volunteers-being-trained-to-look-after-community/story-ASmKefJo2YYC46iCbgxirK.html
24-06-2020||Delhi||Private home care firm appointed without tender, say officials||The contract of a private company roped in by the Delhi government for handling all Covid-19 patients under home quarantine in the Capital was cancelled because the firm was not appointed through a tender, senior government officials privy to the development told HT on Tuesday, adding that a new process with tendering protocols will now be launched. Bengaluru-headquartered Portea Medical was since late April reaching out to Covid-19 patients in home isolation to assess their recovery and determine if they needed medical attention, an arrangement that was scrapped by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) led by Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on June 19. According to officials, the government will now open bids to hire a new contractor for the task, after fresh guidelines issued on Monday by the Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS) allowed for such arrangements to be made to keep a track of home isolation cases. A government spokesperson said that the health department is ready with the tender documents but an approval from the Ministry of Home Affairs is awaited.“For any work that is more than Rs 1 lakh, a limited tender has to be issued and if the project is more than Rs 25 lakh, open advertised tenders have to be floated as per the general financial rules (GFR). But, Portea Medical was appointed on nomination basis. The Delhi cabinet led by chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had approved it, which is against the GFR and CVC guidelines,” said a senior government official, asking not to be named.An official in the L-G office said that the matter was also brought to the notice of the Union ministry of home affairs after which the L-G issued the order to cancel the contract. A Delhi government spokesperson defended the initial arrangement, saying: “Floating a tender would have taken a lot of time and the pandemic demanded such an emergency measure be taken. Besides, the government’s move was in accordance with the disaster management Act which is currently enforced in the city.”However, an official in the L-G office said the company was operating in Delhi since April 30. “It is understandable that the first appointment happened because it was the need of the hour. However, despite more than a month having passed, the government issued no tender. The services of the private firm were supposed to be a stop-gap arrangement,” the official said.Portea Medical company through over 100 people – all based in Bengaluru – made at least one call a day to each patient under home quarantine in Delhi to counsel them and record their symptoms which, if found serious, were relayed to health officials.On Friday, the LG cancelled the contract and the company is allowed to extend its service only to the 10,490 Covid patients who were under home isolation until Friday. For the new patients added in this category since, follow-ups are being done by staff under the district medical officer, which includes the district surveillance office (DSO). These officials were previously handling followup and outreach in the case of suspected patients advised home quarantine.In all, 12,963 of the 24,988 active Covid-19 cases in the capital are under home isolation.According to the latest guidelines issued by the DGHS, follow-ups will now be carried out via telephone calls by a team “outsourced/from linked health centre/medical students from various medical colleges” for a period of nine days after a person tests positive.“A tender for this will be floated soon. But, the L-G should chair a DDMA meeting at the earliest to find a solution to the current problem where newly detected Covid positive patients are not receiving such follow-up calls as promptly as before,” the government spokesperson quoted above said.Portea Medical did not specifically comment on the issue of its appointment. However, it said that the company is working in accordance with the government directives. “We cannot stress enough on the importance of home isolation and care. With an increasing number of cases, it is important that the right kind of infrastructure and provisions are made available to people to ensure timely treatment and decreased mortality. Individualized care is the need of the hour given that different people are exhibiting different symptoms,” it said in a statement.“While home isolation can prove extremely beneficial for those with mild to moderate COVID-19 symptoms, hospital beds should be reserved for those who may have other pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, high blood pressure, etc or develop breathing difficulties. We have seen great success for our home quarantine offering and know that it is possible to recuperate when care is taken within the confines of one’s home environment, provided regular monitoring is also done,” the statement read.The DDMA, in a statement on Monday, stated that regular follow up calls are being made to all positive cases in home isolation by the teams of the district surveillance officers (DSOs) to guide patients on the proper protocols for home quarantine.“It is being ensured that each and every case is followed up with a due protocol and all necessary services are being ensured through the districts,” the DDMA said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/private-home-care-firm-appointed-without-tender-say-officials/story-qDgCrThMNgIE8UyvSRZS0K.html
24-06-2020||Delhi||Political parties bicker over new norms for assessment of mild patients||The new norms for assessment of asymptomatic Covid patients has led to political bickering in Delhi with opposition parties blaming the ruling Aam Aadmi Party for mismanagement.On Tuesday, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia wrote to lieutenant governor Anil Baijal seeking the rollback of the new norms, saying it will only create problems for patients and pressurise the government machinery as people will have to wait longer at the Covid Care Centres (CCCs).In an order issued by the health department after the DDMA meeting on Monday, all asymptomatic patients have to be taken to CCCs for clinical assessment.While addressing a press conference on Tuesday, Sisodia said, “There is a lot of panic among people because of the new guidelines. Earlier, they tried to stop home isolation and a consensus on continuing it was reached after a lot of dialogue. Now, this new guideline. People are upset. Why should a Covid-19 patient be punished and made to stand in a queue at a quarantine centre? I have written to the L-G to continue with the earlier system of the medical team visiting the home of the patients instead.”The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), the chief opposition party in Delhi, said the L-G has taken the right decision. BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, leader of the opposition in the Delhi Assembly, said, “The L-G took this decision after consulting medical experts. There is no harm if Covid positive patients are being examined at quarantine facilities by medical experts. After a proper examination, it will be easy to decide whether the patient should be kept in home isolation or not.”The BJP hit out at the Delhi government for mismanagement in the initial days when the number of cases was less. “They didn’t properly plan for the pandemic and this is why the situation has gone from bad to worse in Delhi. Now, when efforts are being made to put the system back on track, they are doing politics,” Bidhuri said.With nearly 3,000 Covid cases being reported daily for the past few days, the Congress blamed both the state and the central government for the mess in Delhi while not clarifying its stand on the issue at hand.Delhi Congress chief Anil Chaudhury said, “Both of the state and the central governments should stop fighting and focus on improving the infrastructure. The AAP government failed to put in place a proper system for the effective management of patients in home isolations. We had told home minister Amit Shah and the L-G that there was no proper monitoring of those in home isolation.”He added, “There is a need for more quarantine facilities as a majority of the population lives in slums, unauthorised colonies and one or two-bedroom houses. Is home isolation possible there?”AAP did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/political-parties-bicker-over-new-norms-for-assessment-of-mild-patients/story-O3Nc3UFOUOHUl2ZAXmqnrI.html
24-06-2020||Delhi||Mixed bag of facilities at Delhi’s Covid care centres||Dakshinpuri residents Amit Sagar (35) and his wife Komal (26) were shifted to a Delhi government-run Covid Care Centre (CCC) at Terapanth Bhawan in Chhatarpur from home isolation on Saturday afternoon, following lieutenant governor Anil Baijal’s order requiring asymptomatic/mild cases of Covid-19 to be mandatorily quarantined at a facility for five days. Both of them did not have any symptoms.A day later, the order was rescinded and the couple now wants to be sent back home, which they say is a more hygienic environment. “The rooms they showed us were not clean. Used masks were hanging on the doorknobs. But when we requested the staff to sanitise the room, they did so immediately. They should check all this before allotting the rooms,” Sagar said, while adding that the facility was largely well-managed and they were satisfied with the food.The Terapanth Bhawan, a guesthouse, however may not be representative of a typical CCC. Here, rooms -- which are meant to be shared by two people -- are air conditioned and there is an attached bathroom. A majority of the 18 CCCs, however, are in government schools or flats constructed by the Delhi Development Authority and Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) for people from economically weaker sections and the lower-income group categories -- making these unlikely to be equipped with an AC or be as spacious. Some require residents to use common lavatories.The government initially set up CCCs to house mild and moderate cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). A majority of the people evacuated from the Tablighi Jamaat headquarters at Nizamuddin West in March were housed at the CCCs in Narela, Badarpur, Mandoli Jail complex and Bakkarwala.Since May, when the Union ministry of health and family welfare allowed asymptomatic patients to isolate themselves at home if they had the adequate infrastructure, these facilities are being used to house patients who don’t have a separate room and bathroom at home. Currently, the 18 CCCs have a total of 5,909 beds, of which 1,607 were occupied till Monday.Another resident at the Terapanth Bhawan said she would prefer to be at home instead. Anita (35) said she first agreed to come to the facility hoping there would be better medical facilities. “I feel weak and breathless. I thought I’d be kept under observation. But the doctor only checks up on me over the phone. The facility is good, but I think I would have taken better care of myself at home, as there is no special medical treatment for this,” she said.The 120-bed Covid Care Centre in Badarpur is in a government school. The isolation facility comprises 23 classrooms, each housing four or five patients. Currently, there are 97 patients at the facility, which is manned by a team of five doctors and support staff.A doctor at the facility, who asked not to be named, said there is no air-coolers as a precautionary measure and the residents have had to face a mosquito problem since windows and doors are kept open for ventilation. “They often keep the doors open for ventilation. With intermittent rain, there is a problem of mosquito breeding. We have provided mosquito repellents to the patients,” this person said.The situation is the same at Narela, Bakkarwala and the Mandoli jail complex. At Narela, the government has turned 1,000 DDA LIG flats into a CCC facility. Currently, there are 450 patients here, including those who have returned from abroad under the Vande Bharat mission.At these flats, each room has a separate bathroom. But CCCs operating from school complexes such as in Badarpur and New Friends Colony require residents to use common lavatories.While Sagar and Anita said that the food at the centre was good, another woman who requested anonymity said that her daughter and in-laws, who had tested positive on June 19, didn’t get dinner at the Mandoli jail complex CCC as they reached the centre late.“They were taken to the quarantine facility in an ambulance. But as they reached the centre late, they didn’t get anything to eat that day despite several requests to the authorities. But now, everything is fine. All three of them are recovering well,” the woman, a resident of Deoli, said.A senior government official said, “These facilities have been set up in a short period and their functioning has been streamlined now. We try to address logistical issues immediately. We have not received any complaint so far regarding our Covid Care Centres.”With the Delhi Disaster Management Authority, headed by lieutenant governor Anil Baijal, making it mandatory for asymptomatic patients to be taken to these centres for clinical assessments, many residents’ welfare associations opposed the idea and requested the L-G and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal to review the decision.Rajiv Kakria, the convener of Save Our City campaign and a resident of GK-I said, “If a person is asymptomatic, why should they be taken to Covid Care Centres for clinical screening? It is impractical. It will only increase the chances of transmission of the disease. We have been demanding that a strong monitoring mechanism involving RWAs be put in place for effective management and coordination for those in home isolation.”Gufran Nawaz, who returned to India from Oman under the Vande Bharat mission and lived at the Narela facility for a week before he left for West Bengal, said, “I was at the quarantine centre from June 11 to June 17. The quarantine facility is very good.”A Delhi government spokesperson said, “As and when we get a complaint, we rectify it immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/delhi-news/mixed-bag-of-facilities-at-delhi-s-covid-care-centres/story-cUWdK3NPOPvXkrGuJI1BTL.html
24-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram, Faridabad residents demand cancellation of Chinese subsidiary Ecogreen’s contract||Ecogreen, a subsidiary of the Chinese company, Jinjiang Environment Holding Company Limited (CJE) that has been collecting door-to-door waste in Gurugram and Faridabad since December 2017, has been facing resistance from local residents and councillors over the past week amid growing India-China border standoff.Officials of Ecogreen said that although their services have not been affected so far, they have nonetheless faced some troubles during waste collection. As such, they have advised their staff to take necessary precautions and be on alert. Last Wednesday, in DLF Phase-1, around 10 residents protested on the road and allegedly wrote on the society’s WhatsApp group that they wouldn’t allow Ecogreen officials to operate in their area anymore. The matter was resolved after an intervention by the RWA. “A few residents of the society had raised objections and wanted to stop Ecogreen from operating inside the colony because of its Chinese affiliation. Before the matter got out of hand, we quickly met with each one of the protesting residents and apprised them of the importance of waste collection especially during the Covid-19 crisis. After much deliberation, the residents saw reason in our argument and the matter was quickly resolved,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson of DLF Qutub Enclave RWA.Similar objections have been raised in Faridabad as well. On June 19, Manmohan Garg, the deputy mayor of Municipal Corporation of Faridabad (MCF), submitted a request to the civic body, seeking that the contract of Ecogreen be cancelled in the light of the China-India border standoff. “Besides the India-China border crisis, Faridabad councillors have repeatedly voiced their concerns on the operations of Ecogreen. They are operating in multiple cities and we feel that they are too spread out to concentrate properly on just Gurugram and Faridabad. As such, we feel that they are unable to do their job properly. Hence, I have asked the MCF officials to cancel their contract,” said Garg.On June 20, around 30 members of Akhil Bhartiya Kranti Dal, a right-wing group, also took out a protest across several parts of Old Gurgaon, such as Sadar Bazar, sectors 9, 10, 14, and 16, demanding a cancellation of EcoGreen’s contract. “The performance of Ecogreen has been substandard. There is no reason why an Indian-owned company can’t be awarded the contract to carry out waste collection even on a temporary basis. We will be submitting a letter in this regard to the Haryana government and will be repeatedly protesting on the matter for the next two months,” said Rajeev Mittal, national spokesperson for Akhil Bhartiya Kranti Dal (ABKD). On August 14, 2017, that a memorandum of understanding(MoU) was signed between Ecogreen Energy Pvt Limited, the MCF, the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram(MCG), directorate of Urban Local Bodies (ULB), in the presence of chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar for waste collection in the two cities as well as for operating the waste-to-energy (WTE) plant at the Bandhwari landfill.Reacting to the ongoing protests, Sanjeev Sharma, the official spokesperson of Ecogreen, said, “From the outside, we may be perceived as a Chinese company but, apart from 20 Chinese nationals, more than 2,000 of our workers are Indians. We have made more than ₹ 500 crore of investment in the two cities for waste collection, and our staff has continued its service even amid the Covid-19 outbreak. Our staff has faced a few instances of unrest in both cities but the matter has never escalated to being physical or curtailed our operations in any way. We have advised our staff members to take all necessary precautions and stay on alert,” said Sanjeev Sharma, official spokesperson of Ecogreen.“We have not received any complaints — neither against Ecogreen nor from them. If there is any complaint, we will examine it based on performance. We have given them strict directions to collect waste from all corners in the city, especially given the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-faridabad-residents-demand-cancellation-of-chinese-subsidiary-ecogreen-s-contract/story-3xp9VXpObhDHOUv7uGGmfP.html
24-06-2020||Gurugram||Rapid antigen tests to start from today; 8,000 kits received||The Gurugram district administration from Wednesday is all set to ramp up Covid-19 testing in the city by rolling out antigen detection tests from one booth in Sadar Bazar.The district’s health department on Tuesday received 8,000 antigen kits — which can deliver Covid-19 result within 15-30 minutes.Approved by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), these tests look for specific protein associated with the Sars-Cov-2 virus, the pathogen that causes Covid-19. The state health department has already placed an order of 100,000 kits with a South Korean company that has a manufacturing plant in Manesar.Last week, during a review meeting with Union home affairs minister Amit Shah on Covid-19 management in Delhi-NCR, Haryana was directed to use the antigen detection tests widely to cover more people. The RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) tests — often considered the gold standard in front-line testing for Covid-19 — too will continue simultaneously.The district at the moment is conducting around 450 RT-PCR tests daily. The number of antigen tests to be conducted daily is yet to be decided by the administration depending on the response they receive today (Wednesday)..Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, said, “It is a new test which delivers results in 15-30 minutes. Like RT-PCR, nasal swabs will be collected. But in the process of sample collection safety measures are to be taken. Therefore, we are figuring out a planned way to do the tests in different areas. The testing will start with Sadar Bazar area, where our Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) will identify people for collecting swab samples.”He said that better clarity on the testing process will emerge on Wednesday after the actual tests start. “The plan is to conduct the test in a zone-wise manner. The overall plan will be prepared soon,” said Yadav, adding that a team of pathologists, microbiologists and technicians have already been trained tin conducting the tests.The new test, developed by a South Korean company and manufactured in Manesar, is highly specific (99.3% to 100%) — meaning a positive result on the test is a “true positive” and does not need any confirmatory test.The sensitivity is between 50.6% to 84% depending on the viral load, meaning those who test negative might still have the infection and are advised to go for a test through the more reliable RT-PCR method if they show symptoms of the disease.The antigen kits that will be used by the administration comes with a Covid-19 antigen test device, swab for sample collection, and viral extraction tube with viral lysis buffer that makes the virus inactive.Officials of the health department said that they have also increased the RT-PCR testing in the city by increasing the capacity of the lab to process at least 170 samples a day. Dr Jai Prakash, district surveillance officer, said, “RT-PCR test is being done 24 hours daily. Teams have been formed who are working in shifts. It includes seven lab technicians, pathologists, microbiologists, covid microbiologists and data entry operators.”.In Gurugram, as of Tuesday, the total count of people infected with SARS-CoV-2 stood at 4,645, with 133 new cases being added in the last 24 hours. Of the 4,645 cases, 1,833 are active cases and 2,743 have been discharged. At least, 1255 patients are under home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/rapid-antigen-tests-to-start-from-today-8-000-kits-received/story-cJ9gyXQSOD5YytanWFGJFP.html
24-06-2020||Gurugram||Gurugram administration unclear on Covid-19 number projections||The Gurugram administration has retracted its earlier prediction that stated that the number of Covid-19 cases in the district may touch 35,000 by June end — which basically would have meant the district adding more than 30,000 cases in the next seven days.Instead, administration officials now — based on existing test positivity rate data, trends seen in Delhi and Mumbai and extrapolation done over two months — insist that Covid-19 projection is a dynamic process and a truly reflective figure might be difficult to arrive at.Independent health experts believed that the tally in Gurugram is likely to may be reach up to 7,000 cases by month-end. They agreed with district administration officials and said that predicting Covid-19 cases is a complex process, while adding that such forecasts aid in public health decision making, like augmenting facilities and beds required for tertiary care.According to the forecast of Covid-19 cases in Gurugram prepared by the district administration on June 13, at least 35,000 Covid-19 cases were likely to be reported by June 30. Out of these, nearly 80% would need isolation beds, 15% would need general ward beds and the remaining 5% would need to be admitted in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) for ventilator support. As per estimates, the count of infected people in the district was likely to touch 1.5 lakh by July-end and almost 2.5 lakh by August. On the other hand, the adjoining national capital’s future projections were almost 5.5 lakh cases by July 31 alone.Vivek Kalia, nodal officer, hospital management, said, “It would be premature to divulge any quantified figure for Covid-19. However, based on the analysis of data of testing undertaken, doubling rate and the number of positive cases needing hospitalisation, medical facilities have been assessed and requisite provisions have been made.”Even Ashok Sangwan, divisional commissioner, in a press conference earlier this week, had said, “The projected numbers are high but making projections is a dynamic process. Testing has increased in the city to identify cases. With new cases pouring in daily, we are prepared with our healthcare facilities, if the numbers surge.”. Confirming Sangwan’s view, a senior state official, confirmed that the projected figures were inflated. “Nobody can make exact Covid-19 future projections. But based on the increasing number of cases and our projections, we are trying to arrange treatment facilities.”Data expert, Dheeraj Singh, who has been closely monitoring Gurugram’s and Haryana’s Covid-19 data, said that Covid cases daily growth rate in June for Gurugram is 7.8% with positivity rate at 36.7%. “It reflects a combination of high growth and likely wider infection spread with need for tripling the number of tests being conducted. Even at the current rate, total cases in Gurugram will reach 7,000 by June end.”According to him, the numbers will shoot up if testing is adequately scaled up. “However recent testing numbers are seeing wide fluctuations. The lowest (169 tests) number of tests were done on June 14. On June 21, a record 930 tests were conducted in a single day,” he said. Professor Abhijit Das, department of computer science and engineering, Indian Institute of Technology – Kharagpur, who has developed a model that predicts the Covid-19 transmission, said, “The prediction problem at hand is far more complicated than weather or stock-market predictions.”Das’s model relies on the daily count of infection, especially of the most affected states like Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh and West Bengal. As per predictive study conducted by him, the disease will continue to spread till September.He said, “This is an attempt to predict the spread of Covid-19 in our country. However, a reliable and stable predictor could not be designed despite several technical improvements. Still, the current system shows close match with the past data, and can be used as an indication of how protracted the pandemic can be in India.”“Every such model is inaccurate to some degree, but is at the same time capable of giving an approximate view of the future. Perhaps nothing better can be achieved at this point of time,” Das added. On the other hand, Rajib Dasgupta, professor, community health medicine, Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU), said that the department of science and technology (DST) was working towards a Covid -19 Indian National Supermodel to forecast the spread and monitor future transmissions. “We do not know how soon this will be operational. But currently, two standard approaches — Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) model and the Logistic Growth model — are being used to predict the endpoint of Covid-19 both at national level and for the three high-incidence states of Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi,” said Dasgupta.The challenge according to him will be to make future projections when affected states have different experiences, and within them the figures fluctuate between urban and rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/gurugram/gurugram-administration-unclear-on-covid-number-projections/story-Gm71KhuqdubTNh24TQZzEM.html
24-06-2020||Delhi||AIIMS OPD to start from Thursday; 15 patients per OPD allowed every day||The All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Delhi, will restart its out patient department (OPD) services from Thursday, three months after it had to close down in the wake of Coronavirus disease (Covid-19) outbreak. To begin with, the OPDs will be open only for old, follow-up patients.“It will be limited OPD consultations in the beginning, with only those old, follow-up patients called on prior appointment, who need physical examination. Later the services will be open for new patients,” said Dr Aarti Vij, spokesperson, AIIMS. Only 15 patients per OPD will be allowed in a day for any department. No evening speciality clinic will be open in the first phase.“It will be the prerogative of the departments to call patients directly or screen them through tele-consultation before giving a physical appointment…,” AIIMS said in a statement.The appointments will be given online through hospital’s computer facility.On March 24, the hospital had closed all its non-emergency departments, including surgical departments and specialty clinics, stopped seeing all new and follow up patients, and left only its emergency open for non-Covid 19 patients.The decision was in line with a Union health ministry directive, asking hospitals to postpone all non-essential services and elective procedures so as to free up ventilators and intensive care unit beds so that there is no shortage in case there was a surge in Covid-19 cases. In April, the hospital had started teleconsultation facility for its follow-up cases, for which an appointment was to be sought online.“Preference will be given to online consultation that many departments are successfully managing such as medicine, dermatology etc. Those departments that are managing well through telemedicine will be asked to continue doing so,” said Dr Vij.Since March 25, this year, AIIMS has provided tele-consultation to 61,000 patients, and 15, 810 patients were seen in the hospital’s cancer institute. The hospital had its emergency and casualty departments running 24x7, with 15,480 patients have been treated in all. Close to 6,000 emergency surgeries (2,753) and special procedures (2,242) have been performed and 11, 637 non-Covid 19 admissions having taken place.“The hospital was never really shut; we were running our emergency department around the clock. Also, cancer centre was functioning regularly with people coming for chemo and other therapies. The dialysis units were also running to their full capacity even during lockdown for patients with chronic kidney disease. Now we are trying to open the rest of the services in a phased manner, but preference will be given to those departments where physical examination is necessary,” said Dr Vij.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/aiims-opd-to-start-from-thursday-15-patients-per-opd-allowed-every-day/story-DlENeUiU2YFVBHHY9jf2BM.html

The body has been sent for an autopsy.According to police, the incident came to light around 9.30 am when the boy’s older sister saw him hanging from a fan in their rented accommodation.“The boy was brought down while the father was informed. He was then rushed to a private hospital where he was declared brought dead,” said a police official.The boy had been alone in the house at the time of the incident. His mother works with a private hospital while the father is employed at a factory.No note was recovered at the spot and police officers are not ruling out that it could be a death by suicide, accident, or murder. None of the neighbours have also reported seeing anything suspicious, they said.“The body was sent for an autopsy and we will wait for the report to ascertain the cause of death. All angles are being probed for now,” said deputy commissioner of police, zone 2, Harish Chander.He said that so far the family has also not mentioned any reason as to why the boy may harm himself and they have not filed any criminal complaint as well.“A probe is underway and we will know more after the autopsy tomorrow,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/11-year-old-found-dead-at-home/story-WrtC6Zl4DjWweNlPVrwpZL.html
24-06-2020||Noida||GB Nagar to ramp up testing with antigen kits||The Gautam Budh Nagar administration said with the arrival of new rapid “antigen” testing devices, it is going to ramp up its testing capacities for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) from Wednesday. District magistrate Suhas LY said that the health department has made “all necessary arrangements” to increase its ability for early detection of Covid-19 positive cases in the district, and is procuring nearly 15,000 rapid antigen testing kits. “ Along with other regions of NCR, we will start rapid antigen testing in GB Nagar. We are getting over 15,000 kits from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). ICMR officials will also train health department officials, lab technicians of Meerut division on Wednesday in Noida how to use the kits.”  “The rapid antigen test kits will prove as a boon in the detection of coronavirus infections in the district. Health teams will identify high risk groups, people with co-morbidities and symptoms of influenza-like illnesses (ILI).Dedicated teams will be constituted to administer these tests and special drives will be held in containment zones. Testing with these kits will help in early tracking, containment and reduction of mortality rate,” he added Currently, there are 266 containment zones in the district.“We have made 229 category-1 containment zone ( areas with single case) and 53w category-2 containment zone ( areas with multiple cases). Based on the advice of the health department, the incident commander of the area where a containment zone lies, and police officers will decide the perimeter of the sealed area,” the DM added.Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said “massive Covid-19 testing” will begin in the district from Wednesday. “The antigen kits have arrived here and teams led by our doctors will collect samples from all the containment zones initially,” he said.The new “antigen” test devices can be used on-site and are quicker than lab-based RT-PCR (reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction tests)— which were the primary means of testing in the district till now. They are also cheaper and differ in technology as they look for a specific protein associated with the Sars-Cov-2 —the virus that causes Covid-19. The lab tests look for the exact nucleic signatures of the virus.Meanwhile, with 63 new Covid-19 positive cases reported on Tuesday, the case count of the district has now gone up to 1,575 cases.Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said as many as 55 positive patients were discharged from different hospitals on Tuesday. “So far, a total of 949 patients have been cured and discharged from different facilities inthe district. Besides, 19 patients have lost their lives. The district now has 607 active cases,” he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/noida/gb-nagar-to-ramp-up-testing-with-antigen-kits/story-M919qriwD8PNyPz1zuE6qL.html

24-06-2020||Chandigarh||Chandigarh excise policy challenged; HC says liquor vend allotment subject to outcome of petition||The Punjab and Haryana high court on Tuesday said the allotment of liquor vends in Chandigarh would be subject to outcome of a petition filed before it by a liquor contractor.The petitioner, Rajbir Singh, has challenged the excise policy 2020-21, which comes into effect from July 1.It was alleged that the administration’s move is leading to “complete cartelisation and monopoly” of certain individuals through their firms. “The policy is wholly arbitrary. Certain internal departmental stores have been given the licence at the rate of ₹20 lakh to sell foreign liquor while retailers have to pay approximately ₹4 crore as licence fee,” senior advocate Anand Chhibbar told court.It was submitted that the excise policy does not promote free trade, as it states that for any brand of foreign liquor there shall be only five wholesale licensees, who shall further sell liquor to all the retail licensees. “Due to this, instead of buying foreign liquor directly from a reputed manufacturer, small contractor is left at the mercy of the competitor retailer who also has a wholesale authorisation for a particular brand. It will create an unfair advantage to the wholesaler who may chose to sell or make brands available only to their own retail vends,” Chhibbar had told court. It has been argued that the UT should have capped the highest bid and draw of lots could have been introduced so that cartels may not jack up prices to bag contracts. The petition also alleges that classification of vends in city shops (foreign liquor quota increased but country liquor quota decreased), village shops (country quota up but foreign liquor quota decreased) and normal shops (with no change in quota) is unreasonable as it discriminates between liquor vends. The high court bench of justice Rajan Gupta and justice Karamjit Singh while issuing notice for July 8 has made it clear the allotments would be subject to outcome of the petition filed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/chandigarh/chandigarh-excise-policy-challenged-hc-says-liquor-vend-allotment-subject-to-outcome-of-petition/story-2w4z8nG6Dzgc24iDIYtoQN.html
24-06-2020||Pune||Monsoon preparedness: Ramnadi Restoration Mission report lays out plan for flood-free 2020||In August 2019, the Ramnadi (river) flooded parts of Pune, prompting organisations in the city to undertake a restoration programme. These organisations, under the banner of Kirloskar Vasundhara initiated the Ramnadi Restoration Mission and on Tuesday, presented a report to the Pune Municipal Corporation and Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA).The report, titled ‘Flood Free Ramnadi 2020’, underlines measures that the PMC should look at, including restoration of natural waterways and desilting. The report, which will be submitted on June 24 to the PMC commissioner, the mayor and the enivronmental department of the PMC, called for the restoration of the natural cross-section of the river, which claims carries the maximum water to be restored. River bed slopes, bottom widths as well as bank slopes need to be restored. Flooding is a natural characteristic of any river, but interventions in the river basin result in an amplification of the flood, which is what happened in the Ramnadi. “In Baner-Bavdhan-Pashan areas around Ramnadi, the velocity of water coming from the source regions was high, while the downstream it was low, as the Ramnadi channel has narrowed at various places. We have recommended clearing of the river channel, removal of debris and pipes and clearing all streams, as short-term measures. We have made several long term and policy measures too,” said Gurdas Nulkar, member of the Ecological Society.The report also states various ways of effectively preventing flooding, by widening of the waterway to safely carry a flood discharge; or deepening of the river to to accommodate incoming overflow from nallahs and tributaries. The report cites encroachments within the flood lines to be removed and restricted zones to be clearly marked henceforth, with the restoration of natural drainage channels that have been encroached upon, blocked or diverted.According to Virendra Chitrav, convenor of the Ramnadi Restoration Mission: “This advisory will be important for PMC to follow to help stop flooding in areas the Ramnadi flows through. We have recommended creating a hazard mitigation committee with representatives of all PMC departments, public representatives and NGOs, to reduce the economic and social costs of natural hazards. The committee will update and drive communication between the PMC, gram panchayat, irrigation department, NGOs, citizen groups, corporators and sarpanch-level officials. A single-point coordinator needs to be appointed by the PMC to create an actionable program.”The NGOs involved in the Ramnadi Restoration mission are: Ecological Society, Vasundhara Swatchata Abhiyan, Jivitnadi, Biospheres, Mission Ground Water, KOEL, KPCL, Jaldevta Seva Abhiyaan, and Paradkar Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ramnadi-restoration-mission-report-lays-out-plan-for-flood-free-2020/story-sPowN8vvyPzjf3QXpUQlXL.html

It will help to increase testing facilities in the city. We are expecting testing capacity to immediately increase by 500 daily. The PMC will also bear the test costs of pregnant women.”Municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad said, “As PMC is going to bear the cost of tests carried out in private laboratories, it will help to get speedy reports.”Standing committee chairperson Rasane said, “The PMC administration is carrying out discussion with private laboratories for bringing down the rates for testing. The municipal commissioner assured that the civic administration would definitely do the negotiations. But if by any chance, PMC did not get less rates, the standing committee approved the proposal by considering Rs2,200 per test and if the test is conducted by visiting home, Rs2,800 would be given. The civic administration was given a cap and allowed to spend Rs3.5 crore first. Even asked to do one lakh rapid tests for close contact persons who came in contact with a positive person. The cost of rapid test is Rs450 and the standing panel approved to spend Rs4 crore for it. The standing committee will review that the laboratories are doing genuine tests.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/sc-approves-rs-7-5-crore-to-cover-costs-of-tests-in-pvt-labs/story-e0iUMRDVvRf2vf02d7GJmI.html
24-06-2020||Pune||Rising cases leave PCMC to okay home quarantine option||Pune With cases of Covid-19 seeing a rise in Pimpri-Chinchwad, the civic administration has allowed the home quarantine option for those with mild or no symptoms.On Tuesday, the Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) introduced the home isolation policy for Covid-19 patients. “Any person clinically diagnosed as an asymptomatic or mild symptomatic case, having completed mandatory five-day institutional quarantine, will be given an option of home isolation for the next 12 days,” tweeted PCMC.The home isolation provision will not be allowed if the facility of separate bathroom and bedroom is unavailable at the patient’s home. PCMC field workers will be visiting the homes of patients to verify suitability of home isolation. The PCMC move is to free up its resources that are currently under burden due to rising coronavirus cases.The city, as on June 23, has recorded 2,027 total positive cases from 265 on May 22. “PCMC partially lifted lockdown on May 16 and people movement saw a rise,” said Dr Rajendra Namdev Wable, dean, Yashwantrao Chavan Memorial Hospital.To check the increasing positive cases, PCMC plans to test 500 samples per day from its present figure of 300.“There is only one way to check cases — people need to follow hand and respiratory hygiene. One should change his/her old habits to overcome this situation,” said Wable.The first positive case of Covid-19 in PCMC was detected on March 10 when three persons were tested positive. First Covid death occurred on April 12, and the total death count in the month was three. In May, total deaths were eight, while the number increased to 35 till June 23.“Most of the cases are coming from slums and we have increased testing in these areas. The rise in number will not have any impact on businesses in PCMC,” said Anna Bodade, assistant municipal commissioner PCMC. PCMC has also upgraded mobile health checkup bus to collect swab test samples from patients’ doorstep.BoxesCovid figures in PCMC till June 23, 4 pmTotal positive cases: 2,027Active cases: 811Recovered: 1,181Death: 35Status of Active casesAsymptomatic 651Symptomatic 133Critical 27Age wise distinctionChildren (0-12 years) 214 Teens (13-21 years) 257Youths (22-39 years) 812Adults (40-59 years) 525Seniors (60 + years) 217||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/rising-cases-leave-pcmc-to-okay-home-quarantine-option/story-B0CYKOr2lTTjoADKK5fvrJ.html
24-06-2020||Pune||Corruption cases in state dip during lockdown; Pune records highest||Pune: The Maharashtra Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) witnessed a dip in graft cases during the lockdown though it picked up after the curbs were relaxed. Pune division recorded the highest number of corruption cases in the state.From January 1 till June 21 this year, the state recorded 308 cases of which 74 were from the Pune range. The Pune range serves five areas, including Pune, Satara, Sangli, Solapur, and Kolhapur. During the same period last year, ACB had recorded 442 cases from eight divisions covering Maharashtra.The second highest number of cases were from Amravati with 45 cases, followed by Nagpur with 44, Nashik 42, Aurangabad 34, Nanded 32, Thane 26, and Mumbai with 11 cases.“As residents were instructed to remain indoors throughout lockdown, the number of complaints went down,” said Rajesh Bansode, superintendent of ACB Pune.Among the total recorded cases in the state, 282 are trap cases where the person accepting a bribe is caught in the act. Every month, trap cases contribute to a maximum number of cases registered by all units of ACB. From 68 trap cases in January, 72 in February, and 58 in March, the state ACB record recorded a total of 7 cases in April and 30 in May. The number has, however, reached 47 till June 21. Compared to monthly statistics in 2019, trap cases saw a decline of 88 per cent in April and 61 per cent in May, according to data released by ACB.The complainant and the co-operation with ACB in such cases is key to the investigation.“It became very tough to set up traps during the lockdown as it was difficult to maintain secrecy with no movement of people. We had to maintain a high level of secrecy, but we succeeded as there were no failed traps,” he said.Pune recorded the highest number of cases in 2019 also. The number of cases until June 21, 2019, in Pune range was 93, Amravati 62, Nagpur 55, Nashik 53, Aurangabad 59, Nanded 46, Thane 52 and Mumbai at 52.“We have take many steps to educate the masses, including distribution of leaflets, pamphlets, college campus lectures and awareness drives. I think that helped. In 2019, our range was awarded as the best range in the state ACB,” said SP Bansode.Out of the 282 trap cases in 2020, 391 were arrested with a maximum number from the police department followed by revenue and land registration officials.Division -----Number of cases (Jan 1 to June 21, 2020) ---- Number of cases (Jan 1 to June 21, 2019)Mumbai --------------11 ------------------------------------------------ 22Thane --------------26 ------------------------------------------------ 52Pune -------------- 74 ------------------------------------------------ 93Nashik -------------- 42 ------------------------------------------------ 53Nagpur -------------- 44 ------------------------------------------------ 55Amravati -------------45 ------------------------------------------------ -- 62Aurangabad ----------34 ------------------------------------------------ 59Nanded --------------32 ------------------------------------------------ 46Total -------------- 308 ------------------------------------------------ 442||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/corruption-cases-in-state-dip-during-lockdown-pune-records-highest/story-7nPrNhFGIJxWc2ciwfwHaK.html
24-06-2020||Pune||Parisar urges PMC to set up Clean Air Committee for Pune||Civil society organisations and citizens have urged Pune municipal commissioner Shekhar Gaikwad to set up the Clean Air Committee for Pune which has been mandated under the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Launched in January 2019, NCAP requires review committees to be set-up at the state and city levels.Sharmila Deo, air quality (AQ) coordinator at Parisar said that a budget of Rs 10 crore has already been allocated by the environment ministry for this purpose. “The funds are for sweeping machines, tree plantation, electric crematorium, and awareness on air quality. There have been no expenses so far till date,” she said.After the Covid-19 lockdown was declared there was a substantial reduction in the PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels in most of the cities across India. In Pune, PM 2.5 dropped by 32%, PM 10 by 31% and NOx (nitrogen oxides) by 63%, said Deo.Particulate Matter (PM) is mix of suspended particles in the air, and consists of dust, fly ash. soot, smoke, aerosols, fumes and condensing vapours. 2.5 and 10 are sizes of the particles in microns, which is a thousandth of a millimetre. The effects of PM2.5 are far worse since they can penetrate deeper into the body.Deo said, this reduction in pollution levels can clearly be attributed to reduction of vehicles on the road, stopping of construction activity, and minimal open burning.“The city needs to be able to calculate emissions from each of the major sources. While Pune already has 10 air quality monitors set-up by the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), four by Pollution Control Board, and 50 low-cost monitors installed by the Smart City Corporation, there is no common platform where this data is integrated to enable the city to take informed decisions to reduce air pollution,” Deo said.Forecasts can also help citizens take precautions when air quality is predicted to worsen, and the city can take short-term actions to mitigate pollution in such an event, she added.Deo pointed out that air pollution is responsible for around 4.2 million deaths globally each year mainly due to heart disease, respiratory problems, and stroke. It impacts all age groups, from senior citizens to youth, young children to even unborn babies. It affects body organs like liver, kidneys and even affects mental health. Ranjit Gadgil, programme director Parisar, said that cities like Nagpur and Nashik have already set up these committees and convened meetings under them. “It is high time that Pune forms this committee and effective measures are taken through it. The committee should comprise various stakeholders like the PMC, State Pollution Control Board, doctors, air quality experts, Traffic department, Regional Transport Officer, and civil society organisations,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/pune-news/parisar-urges-pmc-to-set-up-clean-air-committee-for-pune/story-J4XruoNQ9HzM1vhgaXAd2K.html

The Indian embassy later tweeted that the Defence Minister was accompanied by Defence Secretary Ajay Kumar, Vice Admiral Hari Kumar and Ambassador D B Venkatesh Varma. The Tri-Service contingent of the Indian Armed Forces comprised 75 all ranks and marched along with contingents of Russian Armed Forces and 17 other countries, according to an official statement.The British Indian Armed Forces during World War-II were one of the largest Allied Forces contingents which took part in the North and East African Campaign, Western Desert Campaign and the European Theatre against the Axis powers. This campaign witnessed sacrifice by over 87,000 Indian servicemen beside 34,354 being wounded, the statement said.The Indian Military not only fought on all fronts, but also ensured delivery of goods along the Southern, Trans-Iranian Lend-Lease route, along which weapons, ammunitions, spare parts for equipment and food went to the Soviet Union, Iran and Iraq, it said.On Tuesday, Singh called on Russian Deputy Prime Minister Yury Borisov and the two leaders held discussions on the bilateral relationship, regional issues, and reviewed the India-Russia defence cooperation.Singh also conveyed his greetings for the solemn ceremonies of the 75th Victory Day and congratulated the “friendly” people of Russia, specially the veterans, who have contributed to the common security of India and Russia, the statement said on Tuesday.The parade was reviewed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, war veterans and guests, including Defence Minister Singh.This year, 14,000 troops and several hundred military machines took part in the parade, including 30 historic T-34 tanks. Modern vehicles also participated, including AFV Terminator, T-72, and T-14 Armata tanks, 9K720 Iskander missile systems, and many other cutting-edge military hardware, Sputnik International reported.Planes and helicopters also participated in an air parade, with Su-25s colouring the sky in white, blue, and red - the colours of the Russian flag, the report added.President Putin congratulated the military and guests, saying this victory determined the future of the planet. Russia postponed its military parade traditionally held on Moscow’s Red Square on May 9 for a later date due to the coronavirus pandemic.On May 26, President Putin announced that the Victory Parade would be held on Moscow’s Red Square on June 24.He explained that this was chosen because on June 24, 1945 the legendary historic parade of victors took place, when soldiers, who fought for Moscow and defended Leningrad, who stood their ground for Stalingrad, liberated Europe and stormed Berlin, marched on Red Square.Singh is the first senior union minister to undertake a foreign visit in four months as international travels were restricted due to the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-military-contingent-participates-in-victory-day-parade-in-russia/story-ebhDHzP0Mk8cSkCCyhqKRJ.html

24-06-2020||World||US says Masood Azhar enjoys ‘state protection’ in Pakistan||The United States on Wednesday said in a rare instance of such direct finger-pointing that Jaish-e-Mohammad founder Masood Azhar and 2008 Mumbai attack mastermind Sajid Mir were “widely believed” to be living “under the protection of the state” in Pakistan, which, additionally, had still not taken “decisive actions” against terrorists based on its soil.The United State has pushed Pakistan for long through threats and appeals to arrest and prosecute terrorists sheltered there and in the state department’s 2019 country reports on terrorism released Wednesday, it welcomed the prosecution of Hafiz Saeed, the founder of Lashkar-e-Toiba, in 2019, along with 12 associates.But Pakistan has made “no effort to use domestic authorities to prosecute” other terrorist figures such as Azhar and Mir, “both of whom are widely believed to reside in Pakistan under the protection of the state, despite government denials”, the repot added.JeM claimed responsibility for the Pulwama terrorist attack in February 2019, that led to significant escalation in tensions between the two nuclear power neighbors. India carried out a retaliatory strike on a JeM camp in Balakot, Pakistan hit back with an air raid, that led to the first air battle between the two air forces in decades. It was rare for the United States to have so very directly accused Pakistan of not only looking the other way as these two terrorists have lived and thrived there, but also of providing them state protection, which had been long apparent to most South Asian officials and experts.The United States has bene critical of Pakistan for yers now for allowing terrorists sheltering on tis soil to operate against India to the east and Pakistan to the west, and had gone so far as to say the Haqqani Network, of the Afghan Taliban, was a “veritable arm” of the Pakistani intelligence agency, the ISI.But accusing Pakistan of providing state protection to Azhar and Mir and their likes, is unusual, but not enough. “The United State has known of the presence in Pakistan of jihadi leaders who operate in India and Afghanistan but wants to keep its channel of communication open with Pakistan which is why it has not used the kind of firm language that it uses about other countries,” said Husain Haqqani, the former US ambassador to Pakistan who now lives in the US.Hafiz Saeed’s arrest and prosecution, for the ninth time, in 2019, had come under intense global pressure as Pakistan had faced with the possibility of being blacklisted at the initiative of the US by a global watchdog on terror financing and money-laundering, the Paris-based Financial Action Task Force.Pakistan narrowly escaped then, but has remained in the dock, as the US terror report reminded. “The FATF expressed serious concern at its October 2019 plenary about Pakistan’s continued deficiencies but noted it had made some progress and extended the deadline for full Action Plan implementation to February 2020.” A final call is expected later in the year, in October.But in the US state department’s assessment, Pakistan still has much to show and improve. “Pakistan continued to serve as a safe haven for certain regionally focused terrorist groups.,” the report said, adding, “It allowed groups targeting Afghanistan, including the Afghan Taliban and affiliated HQN, as well as groups targeting India, including LeT and its affiliated front organizations, and JeM, to operate from its territory.The report acknowledged that Pakistan had made “some” and “modest” progress on countering terrorism, “the most difficult aspects of its 2015 National Action Plan to counter terrorism remains unfulfilled – specifically its pledge to dismantle all terrorist organizations without delay and discrimination”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-masood-azhar-enjoys-state-protection-in-pakistan/story-Q5StShJZy73Bp1bTSGdr5L.html

The aircraft was too high as it neared Jinnah International Airport, leading pilots to disengage the autopilot and take manual control.The tower repeatedly tried to intervene -- calling on the pilots to abort their approach due to the plane’s excess altitude -- but the pilots attempted to land anyway.Inexplicably, at 1,740 feet (530 metres), they raised the landing gear and also deactivated speed brakes, while ignoring a series of alarms in the cockpit.Engines scraped tarmacThe pilots attempted to touch down without the plane’s landing gear extended, scraping the aircraft’s engines across the tarmac, and “initiated a braking action” before abruptly aborting the landing attempt, the report said.CCTV images released with the report showed sparks flying across the runway as the engines scraped the ground.The tower failed to communicate this information to the flight crew or alert emergency services to the problem.The pilots tried to circle back for a second attempt, but the engines -- badly damaged -- lost power, and the pilots issued a “mayday” call.‘Overconfident pilots’The plane then plunged into a nearby residential area and exploded on impact, killing all but two people aboard and a girl on the ground.Investigators said there was no technical issue with the plane, and the government blamed the pilots.Pakistan’s aviation minister Ghulam Sarwar Khan lambasted the crew, saying the pilots were chatting about the coronavirus epidemic rather than following standard flight protocols.He said they were “overconfident”.The country’s deadliest aviation accident in eight years came just days after flights resumed following weeks of inaction due to the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/timeline-to-disaster-the-last-moments-pia-s-flight-8303/story-oEJCJxFMDQa69sA0dNpetI.html
24-06-2020||World||First vaccinations begin in Africa for Covid-19 trial||Africa’s first participation in a Covid-19 vaccine trial started Wednesday as volunteers received injections developed at the University of Oxford in Britain, while officials said the continent of 1.3 billion people cannot be left behind.The large-scale trial is being conducted in South Africa, Britain and Brazil. South Africa has nearly one-third of Africa’s confirmed cases with more than 106,000, including more than 2,100 deaths. The country late Tuesday reported its biggest one-day death toll of 111.The African continent now has nearly 325,000 cases as countries loosen restrictions under economic pressure from citizens who say they have to feed their families. Shortages of testing materials and medical supplies remain a problem as Africa could become the world’s next hot spot.The pandemic was delayed in Africa “but is picking up speed very quickly,” the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention chief John Nkengasong said Wednesday, with a steep increase in the number of cases and deaths.“Unless we act now, Africa is at risk of being left behind on the global vaccine,” he warned a continental discussion and urged that local manufacturing and scientific expertise play a key role.Cameroon, Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and South Africa all have highly developed clinical trial capabilities, said Salim Abdool Karim, chair of South Africa’s ministerial advisory committee for Covid-19.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus urged that the initial supply of any Covid-19 vaccine be deployed where it’s most needed, rather than based on the “ability to pay.” Tedros also announced that as of this week, all 54 of Africa’s countries now have the lab capacity to test for the coronavirus.In February, just two African nations could test for the virus. The continent’s first virus case was reported on Feb. 14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/first-vaccinations-begin-in-africa-for-covid-19-trial/story-GbpKyZupUCdUzN0JOqE1dI.html
24-06-2020||World||US Covid-19 cases surging, officials say it could worsen||As new coronavirus cases surged to a new two-month high of Tuesday mostly reported from more than two dozen western and southern states, top public health officials told US lawmakers they were concerned these could worsen.“That’s something I’m really quite concerned about,” Anthony S Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases and a member of the White House task force fallen into disuse, said at a congressional hearing.“A couple of days ago, there were 30,000 new infections. That’s very disturbing to me.”The total of reported new cases shot up to 34,720 on Tuesday taking the total to 2.34 million, according to the Johns Hopkins Institute tracker, and fatalities went up by 826 to 121,225.Texas and California reported more than 5,000 new cases each Tuesday, surpassing their recent peaks and Arizona, where President Donald Trump addressed an election rally Tuesday, reported more than 3,500 to take the total over 58,000.New York New Jersey and Connecticut, the triangle no northeaster states that had been the epicenter of the outbreak earlier and have since improved drastically, announced Wednesday mandatory two-week quarantine for people traveling from Florida, Texas and Arizona, southern states in the grip of the new surge.Twenty-six states, all in the south and the west, reported more cases last week than the one before. Arizona has been the worst hit, with cases said to be spiraling out of control since its Republican governor ended stay-at-home restrictions last month. And participants at Trump’s rally displayed a similar disregard for social distancing and preventive measures such as masks that the president has continued to show publicly.Fauci and Brett Giroir, a top health department official who also testified along with CDC’s Robert Redfield and FDA’s Stephen Kahn, told lawmakers the new surge of cases was due to increased community transmission. And that the next weeks will be crucial in how the country deals with them“We have all done the best that we can do to tackle this virus and the reality is that it’s brought this nation to its knees,” Redfield told the congressional committeeAll four officials denied, however, ever being told to slow-down testing as has been stated by the president, starting with his speech at the thinly attended election rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma Monday. He had said he ordered for the testing to be slowed down as they only showed increase in cases.His aides claimed the president was joking, which he has denied.“None of us have ever been told to slow down on testing,” Fauci told lawmakers when asked. “That just is a fact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-cases-surging-officials-say-it-could-worsen/story-aghQsXjAXn9eCUjzbnkmOL.html

Let’s pray for them. May the help of God and our brothers give them strength and support. Brothers and sisters, I am very close to you,” he said at his weekly general audience.It was felt in Guatemala and throughout south and central Mexico.In Huatulco, a laid-back beach destination known for surfing and small protected coves, the earthquake knocked goods off shelves and some rubble from buildings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-toll-due-to-earthquake-in-mexico-rises-to-6-hundreds-of-home-damaged/story-6bGBrP1oNqke9LtvnPNA5H.html
24-06-2020||World||UK court to rule on divided Hinduja family’s assets||A judgement of the high court of England and Wales on Tuesday revealed a split in the Hinduja family on the issue of dividing the assets of its business empire ranging across continents, with Srichand, the eldest, ranged against three brothers, Gopichand, Prakash and Ashok.Srichand, 84, is ailing due to age-related diseases, and being unable to conduct proceedings in court, is represented by his daughter, Vinoo Hinduja. At the centre of the row are two letters of July 1 and 2, 2014, signed by Srichand and the three brothers.According to the latest Sunday Times Rich List, the Hinduja family is worth £16 billion. The three brothers, according to the ruling, rely on Srichand’s lack of capacity to seek control of the Hinduja Bank which is in his sole name.The court has been asked to determine the validity and effect of the letters. The July 2 letter includes statements to the effect, among other things, that the brothers appoint each other as their executors, and that assets held in any single brother’s name belong to all four.The letters also state that Gopichand, Prakash and Ashok are authorised to carry out all steps to implement the other letter. But Srichand sought a declaration that neither document has legal effect, whether as a will, power of attorney, declaration of trust or other binding document, or alternatively that the documents are revocable and have been revoked.According to the judgement, Srichand made a witness statement in July 2016 that the July letter does not reflect his wishes and that the family’s assets should be separated. The court accepted that Vinoo Hinduja is appointed by him as his ‘litigation friend’ to act on his behalf.The three brothers (Gopichand, Prakash, Ashok) said in a statement on Wednesday: “It will be apparent from the Judgment of the High Court in England that Mr S P Hinduja’s health has been deteriorating for a number of years suffering from Lewy Body disease, which is a form of dementia”.“Vinoo, his younger daughter, acting as his Litigation Friend is bringing these proceedings on his behalf. It is very unfortunate that these proceedings are taking place as they go against our Founder’s and family’s values and principles that have stood for many decades, especially, ‘everything belongs to everyone and nothing belongs to anyone’. We intend to defend the claim to uphold these dearly held family values”.“We would also stress that this litigation will not have any impact on our global businesses, which will continue to function as they have been. We hope you will understand that these are private family matters which are now the subject of litigation and we cannot comment any further”, their statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-court-to-rule-on-divided-hinduja-family-s-assets/story-6WEcU0UgsCz8RNTioWhCHK.html
24-06-2020||World||Herd immunity threshold could be lower than previously thought: Study||Herd immunity to Covid-19, which happens when so many people in a community become immune to the disease that it stops spreading, could be achieved with fewer people being infected than previously estimated, according to a new study. Scientists, including those from the University of Nottingham in the UK, noted that herd immunity develops when individuals contracting the disease build up natural immunity, and by people receiving a vaccine. They explained that when a large percentage of the population becomes immune to a disease, the spread of the disease slows down or stops and the chain of transmission is broken. In the current study, published in the journal Science, the researchers devised a mathematical model categorising people into groups reflecting age and social activity level to determine the threshold of the population that needed to be immune for herd immunity to develop. When they factored in differences in age and social activity in the model, they found that the herd immunity level reduced from 60 to 43 per cent. The 43 per cent figure, according to the scientists, should be interpreted as an illustration rather than an exact value, or even a best estimate. For Covid-19, they said herd immunity is often stated as around 60 per cent, a figure derived from the fraction of the population that must be vaccinated in advance of an epidemic to prevent a large outbreak. This figure assumes that each individual in the population is equally likely to be vaccinated, and hence immune, the scientists explained. However, they said this is not the case if immunity arises as a result of disease spreading in a population consisting of people with many different behaviours. “By taking this new mathematical approach to estimating the level for herd immunity to be achieved we found it could potentially be reduced to 43 per cent and that this reduction is mainly due to activity level rather than age structure,” explained study co-author Frank Ball from the University of Nottingham. According to the scientists, the more socially active individuals are, the more likely they are to get infected, than the less socially active ones -- and they are also more likely to infect people if they become infected. The researchers said the herd immunity level is lower when immunity is caused by disease spreading than when immunity comes from vaccination.They believe that the findings have potential consequences for the release of lockdown measures across the world, and suggested that individual variation is an important feature to include in models that guide policy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/herd-immunity-threshold-could-be-lower-than-previously-thought-study/story-m1kzLsVFwMjgzfcX7NrvuN.html

We immediately called the Punjab Forensic Science Agency for further investigation into the incident,” Syed told Dawn.“It was purely a case of addiction as the boy used to play PUBG game for many hours a day. The boy’s father also confirmed about his obsession with the online game on which he spent many hours a day,” the police officer said. This is said to be the fourth suicide in Punjab province related to the online games. Earlier, another online game “Blue Whale Challenge” claimed the lives of many teenagers in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-teenager-commits-suicide-after-failing-to-complete-online-game-task/story-MYOmiPJLbjrncTvRneWcjN.html
24-06-2020||World||Advanced cancer, chemotherapy may not aggravate risk of severe Covid-19: Study||Advanced cancer, and chemotherapy treatment may not increase the risk of developing severe Covid-19, according to a study which assessed more than 400 patients hospitalised with novel coronavirus infection. The research, published in the journal Nature Medicine, noted that 40 per cent of 423 patients with cancer at a New York City cancer centre diagnosed with Covid-19 were hospitalised. According to the researchers, including Mini Kamboj from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in the US, 20 per cent of the patients developed severe respiratory illness and 12 per cent died within 30 days. While chemotherapy was not found to be an aggravating factor, they said patients treated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy were more likely to be hospitalised with respiratory complications from the viral infection. While earlier studies from China and Italy suggested that there is a higher Covid-19 death rate in patients with cancer, the scientists said little is known about the interplay between the two illnesses, or how active cancer treatment might exacerbate the effects of Covid-19. In the study, they analysed the clinical characteristics of 423 patients with cancer and Covid-19, of whom 212 patients were male and 211 were female. According to the study, about 56 per cent of the patients were over 60 years of age, and were more frequently diagnosed with solid tumours, including breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and lung cancer. The scientists said 59 per cent of patients also had pre-existing conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, kidney or heart disease, which have also been associated with increased illness severity. Of the 20 per cent of patients with severe respiratory illness, they said 11 per cent required high-flow oxygen and 9 per cent required respirators. According to the study, the risk factors for hospitalisation included having a blood-cancer diagnosis, non-white race, corticosteroid use, and immune-checkpoint-inhibitor drug therapy. The scientists said the risk factors for severe respiratory illness were similar but not identical. They cautioned that further research in larger patient populations is needed to identify risks from Covid-19 in various cancers and with different therapies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/advanced-cancer-chemotherapy-may-not-aggravate-risk-of-severe-covid-19-study/story-GufrvAdyzGFDJncX1c4R0H.html

In response, Johnson said: “We have a very effective cluster-busting operation which is designed to ensure that we keep those outbreaks under control.” “I am not going to pretend ... that this thing is beaten or that the virus has gone away ... We have to remain vigilant and local councils will be supported in doing their vital work in implementing local lockdowns,” he added, challenging Starmer to find any other country that has a functioning tracing app.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-dismisses-criticism-on-local-lockdowns-coronavirus-app/story-g1ae1k3T5mzvO88YZJNJbL.html
24-06-2020||World||‘World went mad’ imposing Covid-19 lockdowns, says Swedish epidemiologist||The man behind Sweden’s controversial Covid-19 strategy has characterized lockdowns imposed across much of the globe as a form of “madness” that flies in the face of what is known about handling viral outbreaks.Anders Tegnell, Sweden’s state epidemiologist, said he advised against such restrictions on movement because of the detrimental side effects they often entail.“It was as if the world had gone mad, and everything we had discussed was forgotten,” Tegnell said in a podcast with Swedish Radio on Wednesday. “The cases became too many and the political pressure got too strong. And then Sweden stood there rather alone.”SWEDEN INSIGHT: Less of an Outlier -- High Frequency DashboardTegnell admits he misjudged the deadly potential of the coronavirus in its early stages, but has refused to consider abandoning his strategy. He says restricting movement to the radical extent seen across much of the globe can create other problems, including increased domestic abuse, loneliness and mass unemployment.“In the same way that all drugs have side effects, measures against a pandemic also have negative effects,” he said. “At an authority like ours, which works with a broad spectrum of public health issues, it is natural to take these aspects into account.”But Sweden now has one of the world’s highest Covid-19 mortality rates, with more deaths per 100,000 than the US, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Polls suggest Swedes have started to lose faith in their country’s response to the pandemic.Instead of shuttering schools, shops and restaurants, Sweden left pretty much everything open. Citizens were encouraged to observe social distancing guidelines, but the strategy assumed Swedes would voluntarily alter their behaviour without the need for laws.Tegnell also advised against using face masks, arguing there’s little scientific evidence they work. And he says it’s clear that closing down schools was an unnecessary response to the pandemic, a notion that’s actually supported in a recent French study.Tegnell’s underlying argument is that Covid-19 isn’t going away any time soon, meaning sudden, severe lockdowns will ultimately prove ineffective in addressing the longer-term threat. Meanwhile, the virus has recently resurfaced in a number of places where authorities thought they’d brought it under control, including Beijing.“I’m looking forward to a more serious evaluation of our work than has been made so far,” Tegnell said. “There is no way of knowing how this ends.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-went-mad-imposing-covid-19-lockdowns-says-swedish-epidemiologist/story-0QsmZAhZ4uYaC7elcYnThP.html
24-06-2020||World||Pilots on Pak plane that crashed were ‘discussing coronavirus during landing’||A plane crash which killed 97 people in Pakistan last month was because of human error by the pilots, who were discussing the coronavirus crisis during the landing, according to an initial report released Wednesday.The Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane crashed into a crowded residential area on May 22 after both engines failed as it approached Karachi airport, killing all but two people on board.“The pilot, as well as the (air traffic) controller, didn’t follow the standard rules,” said Ghulam Sarwar Khan, the country’s aviation minister, announcing the findings in parliament.He said the pilots had been discussing the deadly virus as they attempted to land the Airbus A320 and had disengaged the craft’s autopilot.“The pilot and co-pilot were not focused and throughout they were having a conversation about corona. The [virus] was on their minds. Their families were affected and they were having a discussion about it,” Khan added.“Unfortunately the pilot was overconfident,” the minister said.The report found the plane was flying at more than twice the altitude it should have been when it approached the runway without the landing gear down.Standard flight operating procedures were then ignored by the pilots and the air traffic controller, resulting in an aborted landing that heavily damaged the plane’s engines.The aircraft went down as it attempted a second landing, crashing into a residential area near the airport.The investigation team, which included officials from the French government and the aviation industry, analysed cockpit data and voice recorders.The full report is expected to be released at the end of the year, with advance analysis of the aircraft wreckage still ongoing.The minister said the plane was “100 percent fit for flying, there was no technical fault”.The crash damaged around 29 houses, the minister said, adding that the government would compensate residents for losses.- Chequered safety record -The county’s deadliest aviation accident in eight years came days after domestic commercial flights resumed following a two-month coronavirus lockdown.Many passengers were on their way to spend the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr with loved ones.Images from the scene showed buildings torn apart after the plane’s wings sliced through rooftops, sending flames and plumes of smoke into the air.In a rescue operation that lasted until the next day, firefighters pulled bodies from the wreckage still wearing seatbelts.Nobody on the ground was killed.Pakistan has a chequered military and civilian aviation safety record, with frequent plane and helicopter crashes over the years.In 2016, a PIA plane burst into flames after one of its two turboprop engines failed while flying from the remote north to Islamabad, killing more than 40 people.The deadliest air disaster in Pakistan was in 2010 when an Airbus A321 operated by private airline Airblue and flying from Karachi crashed into the hills of Islamabad as it came in to land, killing all 152 people on board.An official report blamed the accident on a confused captain and a hostile cockpit atmosphere.PIA, one of the world’s leading airlines until the 1970s, now suffers from a sinking reputation due to frequent cancellations, delays and financial troubles.It has been involved in numerous controversies over the years, including the jailing of a drunk pilot in Britain in 2013.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilots-on-pak-plane-that-crashed-were-discussing-coronavirus-during-landing-report/story-YFUsiVdDdDMPsmJ655501I.html
24-06-2020||World||Covid-19: Second wave a real risk, say UK health leaders||Hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced easing of lockdown curbs from July 4, heads of several medical organisations said on Wednesday that there is “a real risk” of a second wave of the coronavirus, and demanded a review of the UK’s state of preparedness to deal with it.Sounding an upbeat note after recent days and weeks showed a fall in infections, Johnson said on Tuesday that the 2-metre social distancing rule could now be cut, allowing pubs, restaurants, museums, cinemas and others places could re-open from July 4 with ‘Covid-19-secure’ precautions. Guidance on re-opening was published sector-wise on Wednesday.In a letter to the British Medical Journal, 16 experts heading royal colleges or medical organisations or medical journals addressed leaders of political parties, reminding them that several countries are now experiencing flare-ups.They wrote: “While the future shape of the pandemic in the UK is hard to predict, the available evidence indicates that local flare-ups are increasingly likely and a second wave a real risk. Many elements of the infrastructure needed to contain the virus are beginning to be put in place, but substantial challenges remain”.“The job now is not only to deal urgently with the wide ranging impacts of the first phase of the pandemic, but to ensure that the country is adequately prepared to contain a second phase”.Calling for an assessment of the state of UK’s preparedness to deal with the second wave, the experts wrote that it should focus on areas of weakness where action is needed urgently to prevent further loss of life and restore the economy as fully and as quickly as possible.The policy areas that need rapid attention, they wrote, include procurement of goods and services; the disproportionate burden on black, Asian, and minority ethnic individuals and communities; and international collaboration, especially to mitigate any new difficulties in pandemic management due to Brexit.The experts wrote: “We are not wedded to any particular design of inquiry or review, but as outlined in the editorial, we believe it should be quick, broad, ambitious, able to command widespread public and stakeholder trust, and needs to happen now”.“As stakeholders and leaders of the UK’s medical, nursing, and public health professions, we urge you to establish such a review. We think there’s a strong case for an immediate assessment of national preparedness, with the first results available no later than August, and that all its work should be completed by the end of October”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-second-wave-a-real-risk-say-uk-health-leaders/story-QwbvsC38iV1tfnqBgkmHkN.html
24-06-2020||World||Pilots of crashed PIA plane were not focussed, were discussing Covid: Minister||The pilots of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane that crashed last month were not focussed and they were discussing coronavirus during the flight, the country’s aviation minister told Parliament on Wednesday as he pointed out their “overconfidence and lack of concentration” as some of the reasons for the tragedy that killed 97 people on board. The domestic flight from Lahore to Karachi crashed in a residential area near the Jinnah International Airport in Karachi on May 22.The Airbus A320 aircraft of the national carrier had 91 passengers and a crew of eight when it crashed into the Jinnah Garden area near Model Colony in Malir on Friday, minutes before its landing. One girl died on the ground after suffering burn injuries.Two passengers miraculously survived the crash.Federal Minister for Aviation Ghulam Sarwar Khan presented the interim investigation report on the PIA plane crash in the National Assembly, saying that the pilots were not focused and their lack of concentration had caused the crash.Human error by the pilots and air traffic control caused the crash of the Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) plane, he said.The minister said that the pilots had ignored the instructions of the air traffic control on the height of the aircraft.“The pilots and the ATC both did not follow the protocol,” he said. “The pilot ignored the instructions of the air traffic controllers and the ATC, on the other hand, did not inform the pilot about the engine colliding.“The pilots were discussing corona throughout the flight. They were not focussed. They talked about corona [...] their families were affected. When the control tower asked him to increase the plane’s height, the pilot said ‘I’ll manage’. There was overconfidence,” he said. Sarwar said that the cabin crew and ATC were also responsible for the tragedy.“Those who are responsible will be held accountable,” he said, promising that the complete investigation report will be presented in one year’s time.Sarwar said that the initial report pointed out that there was no technical fault with the aircraft and even the pilot had not said the same in his conversation with the air traffic controllers.The minister noted that the aircraft touched the runway thrice without the landing gear which caused damage to its engines.“When the plane took off again, both its engines had been damaged,” he said.Sarwar said that the conversation between the pilot and the air traffic controllers had been recorded and he had heard it himself.The minister said that the equipment from the aircraft had been extracted and decoded. He said that the recording obtained would be made part of the final report of the PIA plane crash.The minister said that 40 per cent of pilots of the national flag bearer were flying aircraft with fake licenses. He said that these pilots had not given the exams themselves nor did they have the proper flying experience, he added.“Pilots are also appointed on a political basis, unfortunately,” he said. “Whilst appointing pilots, merit is ignored,” he added, disclosing that degrees of four PIA pilots had been found out to be fake.Sarwar said that the government will take action against PIA pilots who were found guilty of the above offenses. He said that the government will ‘restructure’ the PIA and will take it back to its days of glory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilots-of-crashed-pia-plane-were-not-focussed-were-discussing-covid-report/story-oAzGeOCtvXkj8cpMhgp8rI.html
24-06-2020||World||Merkel’s popularity surge puts German Greens on the back foot||The Greens are struggling to sustain their momentum as Covid-19 upends German politics.The party led the polls in Germany last year but their rise has been arrested by the resurgence of the Christian Democrats, boosted by Chancellor Angela Merkel’s measured handling of the pandemic. With an election due next year, the Greens have slipped back below 20%, barely half the level of Merkel’s CDU-led bloc, and Co-Chairman Robert Habeck, once tied as the nation’s most popular politician, now ranks a distant seventh.That’s a blow to those hoping that the post-Merkel era might see a step change in Berlin that would place Germany at the forefront of the European Union’s push to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, the next government is more likely to mean just an incremental change from the current one.The Greens will probably still be the only party willing and able to give the Christian Democrats a majority after next year’s general election. But they are unlikely to have enough political capital to really set the agenda with neither of Merkel’s likely successors boasting particularly green credentials.“From today’s standpoint, the Greens would be the smaller partner, a majority-maker,” said Thomas Jaeger, a professor of politics at the University of Cologne.That’s a comedown from earlier this year when Berlin insiders were speculating that next year’s election could produce the first Green chancellor, or when French President Emmanuel Macron met with Habeck and co-chair Annalena Baerbock for an unprecedented three-hour chat at February’s Munich Security Conference. In January, Habeck had made his debut at the World Economic Forum in Davos.After emerging from the anti-nuclear movement and the left-wing fringe in the 1980s, the Greens served eight years with the Social Democrats before Merkel came to power in 2005, and they have made no secret of their ambitions for a return to power.The party has steadily moved toward the center -- so much so, that on its 40th anniversary in January former Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble called them a “dead ordinary” party. They’ve also established themselves as a major force in German politics. Even after their recent dip, they are still the country’s second-most popular party.“We are at about the level we were in the last European election, historically our best result nationwide,” Michael Kellner, the party’s political managing director, said in an email. “We’re not going to be driven crazy if it goes up or down a few percentage points.”‘I’m not sure’Whether the Greens can get back into position to challenge the CDU’s ascendancy before next year’s vote will depend on the economy and the climate, as well as the virus.Another harsh drought or an international climate crisis like last year’s fires could reignite support beyond young, urban professionals and the CDU itself will be something of an unknown quantity fighting its first election in a generation without Merkel as the chancellor candidate.On the other hand, a prolonged recession would mean a struggle for the Greens, who are still seen as inexperienced on the economy.“I’m not sure it’s the right party at the right time to ensure Germany’s prosperity, there’s lots of uncertainty and fear,” said Richard Martin, a former party member who runs a small IT company in the suburbs of Berlin.The party’s unbridled pro-immigration stance and apparent hunger for power don’t sit entirely well with him either. “They’ve lost authenticity,” he said.New ChallengesThe pandemic posed a whole new set of challenges to the Greens at a moment when they were starting to be taken seriously as a mainstream force.At first they backed the lockdown but then switched tack to criticize the social inequality of the measures, insisting the post-corona world needs to be a more equitable and sustainable place. On a recent TV talk show, Habeck highlighted the need for larger pig sties.The bigger problem though was that incumbents in Berlin and Brussels elbowed their way onto traditional Green territory with billions of euros for climate policy as part of their efforts to shore up the economy.But their future as a coalition partner for the post-Merkel CDU still has an air of inevitability about it in Berlin. Not least because the party’s existing partner, the SPD, is determined to go into opposition to rebuild when the current term ends. That alone means that the Greens will still have some leverage.“It’s clear that the Greens won’t have the power to advance the climate agenda they want,” Oskar Niedermayer, profesor emeritus of political science at the Free University in Berlin, said in a phone interview. “But they also have an important bargaining chip because there may be no other coalition option.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/merkel-s-popularity-surge-puts-german-greens-on-the-back-foot/story-wyyctX1z5iOPPGSSDbXgJK.html
24-06-2020||World||Two Republicans opposed by Donald Trump win in Kentucky, North Carolina||Voters rebuffed President Donald Trump and nominated two Republicans he opposed to House seats from North Carolina and Kentucky on Tuesday. Calls in higher-profile races in Kentucky and New York faced days of delay as swamped officials count mountains of mail-in ballots.In western North Carolina, GOP voters picked 24-year-old investor Madison Cawthorn, who uses a wheelchair following an accident, over Trump-backed real estate agent Lynda Bennett. The runoff was for the seat vacated by GOP Rep. Mark Meadows, who resigned to become Trump’s chief of staff and joined his new boss in backing Bennett.Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie, a libertarian-minded maverick who often clashes with GOP leaders, was renominated for a sixth House term. Trump savaged Massie in March as a “disaster for America” who should be ejected from the party after he forced lawmakers to return to Washington during a pandemic to vote on a huge economic relief package.Cawthorn, who will meet the constitutionally mandated minimum age of 25 when the next Congress convenes, has said he’s a Trump supporter, and Massie is strongly conservative. Still, their victories were an embarrassment to a president whose own re-election campaign has teetered recently.As states ease voting by mail because of the coronavirus pandemic, a deluge of mail-in ballots and glacially slow counting procedures made delays inevitable. That torturous wait seemed a preview of November, when more states will embrace mail-in voting and officials warn that uncertainty over who is the next president could linger for days.Kentucky usually has 2% of its returns come from mail ballots. This year officials expect that figure to exceed 50%, and over 400,000 mail ballots were returned by Sunday.New York officials expect the vast majority of votes to be mail ballots this year, compared to their typical 5% share. Counties have until eight days after Election Day to count and release the results of mail ballots, with 1.7 million requested by voters.In the day’s marquee contests, two young African American candidates with campaigns energized by nationwide protests for racial justice were challenging white Democratic establishment favorites for the party’s nominations.First-term state legislator Charles Booker was hoping a late surge would carry him past former Marine fighter pilot Amy McGrath for the Democratic Senate nomination from Kentucky. And in New York, political newcomer Jamaal Bowman was seeking to derail House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel’s bid for a 17th term.In Kentucky, many counties including Jefferson, the state’s largest, faced piles of mail-in ballots and reported no results. The Associated Press doesn’t expect to call the McGrath-Booker race until June 30, when Kentucky plans to release additional tallies.Even so, Booker and supporters gathered in Louisville chanted ’’from the ‘hood to the holler,” the slogan he hoped would help build a coalition of urban Blacks and rural whites.“We have the opportunity to transform history,” Booker said.The AP was also delaying its call in New York’s Engel-Bowman race, pending additional vote tallies.In other contests, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky easily won the Republican nomination for a seventh Senate term and will be favored in November against McGrath or Booker.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., won renomination, cementing her rise from obscurity to progressive icon status when she ousted Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley, on track to become speaker, from the New York City district.In Virginia, retired Army Col. Daniel Gade won the GOP Senate nomination but seems certain to lose to Democratic Sen. Mark Warner in November. Republican Scott Taylor will face Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria in a rematch between two Navy veterans in a Virginia Beach district from which she toppled him in 2018.And Cameron Webb, a health policy researcher, won the Democratic nomination for a central Virginia House district. GOP Rep. Denver Riggleman lost his party’s nomination, fueling Democrats’ hopes that Webb, an African American, can capture the seat.Voters endured 90-minute waits in Kentucky’s second-largest city, Lexington, and social media posts showed long lines in New York’s Westchester County deep into the evening. Yet overall, the day’s problems seemed less widespread than in recent elections in Georgia and Nevada, where some people stood in line for hours.In Louisville, voting advocates complained that an unknown number of people stayed home because of difficulty traveling to the city’s single polling place — the Kentucky Exposition Center.“In my neighborhood, most people don’t have cars,” said voter Michael Baker. “It’s not fair for them to have one site.”A judge kept the polling place open an extra half hour after about 175 people, some of whom pounded on the building’s doors, demanded to vote. Louisville, the state’s biggest city, has 600,000 residents.In the big New York and Kentucky contests, Democrats were watching whether nationwide protests sparked by last month’s killing of George Floyd by Minneapolis police would translate to a decisive turnout by African American and progressive voters.Kentucky’s McGrath has a military resume, centrists views and fundraising abilities that helped her win support from Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., to oppose McConnell.Booker’s campaign caught fire after he attended recent protests against the March police killing of 26-year-old Breonna Taylor in her Louisville home. That helped him win support from progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and the state’s two largest newspapers.In one measure of McGrath’s financial advantage, she has spent $16 million in ads compared to Booker’s $2 million, according to Advertising Analytics, which studies campaign advertising.In New York, Engel is supported by Democratic stars like Hillary Clinton, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Congressional Black Caucus, plus major labor unions. He’s one of Congress’ most liberal members.Bowman, an educator, has drawn strength from anti-racism protests and his accusations that Engel has grown aloof from his diverse district in parts of the Bronx and Westchester. Bowman has been helped by progressive groups and lawmakers like Sanders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-republicans-opposed-by-donald-trump-win-in-kentucky-north-carolina/story-CfgSpDzjAMdGFLzBL7d2lO.html

Chinese and Indian military commanders agreed on Monday to disengage their forces in the disputed area.Qureshi, in his comments broadcast by Geo TV, offered no evidence for his allegations and there was no immediate comment from India or China.The remarks were Qureshi’s latest verbal attack on India. On Tuesday he condemned India’s move ordering Pakistan’s diplomatic mission in New Delhi to reduce its staff by half within a week.The Indian foreign ministry said it will do the same in Islamabad after two Indian Embassy employees were seized at gunpoint in Pakistan.Earlier, Pakistani authorities had said that two people, identified as drivers for the Indian High Commission, were arrested when they hit a pedestrian and tried to flee. They said police searched the vehicle and found counterfeit currency inside.The two were released to the high commission and were transported to the border, where they crossed into India, authorities said.Qureshi alleged that India, “after being beaten and embarrassed” by China in the Himalayan incident was trying to find an excuse for an operation against Pakistan.“If 50% of our embassy staff comes back, then the Indian Embassy staff will also go back,” he said..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-s-shah-mahmood-qureshi-warns-india-over-downgrading-of-diplomatic-staff/story-WLB6buOzTUl7zKqEdZVheM.html

He has often visited bakeries and outdoor food stalls, drawing crowds around him.Judge Renato Coelho Borelli said in his ruling that Bolsonaro “has exposed other people to the contagion of a disease that has caused national commotion.” Brazil’s federal district requires people to wear face masks in public to help control the spread of the new coronavirus. Failure to comply carries a possible daily fine of USD 390.Bolsonaro often appears at public events with a mask, unlike some other heads of state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazilian-court-orders-prez-jair-bolsonaro-to-wear-face-mask-when-outdoors/story-yxFmFZzAvjx2amoiIdshrL.html

Tehran rejected the resolution and said it would deliver an “appropriate response.” Its envoy to the IAEA warned that the agency risked “destroying” the Islamic Republic’s nuclear deal with five world powers.The 2015 accord has already been severely compromised by the Trump administration’s withdrawal two years ago and imposition of bruising sanctions. On Wednesday, Rouhani said his country isn’t waiting to see the outcome of the US presidential election in November, and is “ready to negotiate the moment the White House and the US Congress decide to leave their misguided path and return to the P5+1 group” of nations that signed the agreement.He didn’t say what the substance of those negotiations would be.The IAEA resolution was the first formal rebuke of Iran since 2012.“It is easy for the Islamic Republic to give a decisive response, but the IAEA should be careful not to get derailed from its path,” Rouhani said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-it-s-ready-to-work-with-atomic-watchdog-after-un-rebuke/story-eP5Uu8URoqSaAVTU0rSg9L.html
24-06-2020||World||United States Covid-19 cases surge to highest level in two months||New coronavirus cases in the US have surged to their highest level in two months and are now back to where they were at the peak of the outbreak.The US on Tuesday reported 34,700 new cases of the virus, according to a tally compiled by Johns Hopkins University that was published Wednesday. There have been only two previous days that the US has reported more cases: April 9 and April 24, when a record 36,400 cases were logged.New cases in the US have been surging for more than a week after trending down for more than six weeks. While early hot spots like New York and New Jersey have seen cases steadily decrease, the virus has been hitting the south and west. Several states on Tuesday set single-day records, including Arizona, California, Mississippi, Nevada and Texas.Also read| Global Covid-19 death toll surges past 475,000: ReportCases were also surging in other parts of the world. India reported a record daily increase of nearly 16,000 new cases. Mexico, where testing rates have been low, also set a record with more than 6,200 new cases.But China appears to have tamed a new outbreak of the virus in Beijing, once again demonstrating its ability to quickly mobilize vast resources by testing nearly 2.5 million people in 11 days.ALSO WATCH | ‘Kung Flu’: Donald Trump mocks China over Covid; White House denies racism In the US state of Arizona, which on Tuesday reported a record 3,600 new infections, hundreds of young conservatives packed a megachurch to hear President Donald Trump’s call for them to back his reelection bid.As he did at a rally in Oklahoma over the weekend, Trump referred to the virus with a pejorative term directed at its emergence in China.Ahead of the event, the Democratic mayor of Phoenix, Kate Gallego, made clear that she did not believe the speech could be safely held in her city — and urged the president to wear a face mask. He did not. Trump has refused to wear a mask in public, instead turning it into a red-vs.-blue cultural issue.Also read: Swedish confidence levels jump as Covid-19 concern recedesEarlier Tuesday, Dr. Anthony Fauci told Congress that the next few weeks are critical to tamping down the surge.“Plan A, don’t go in a crowd. Plan B, if you do, make sure you wear a mask,” said Fauci, the infectious disease chief at the National Institutes of Health.In China, an outbreak that has infected more than 200 people in the capital this month appeared to be firmly waning. China on Wednesday reported 12 cases, down from 22 the day before. Beijing reported seven new cases, down from 13.Officials in Beijing said they tested more than 2.4 million people between June 12 and June 22. That’s more than 10% of the capital’s population of about 20 million.Authorities began testing people at food markets and in the areas around them. They expanded that to include restaurant staff and the city’s 100,000 delivery workers. China also said it used big data to find people who had been near markets for testing, without specifying how.The vast majority have tested negative, though one courier delivering groceries from supermarkets tested positive.A single inflatable mobile lab in one district was capable of conducting 30,000 tests a day, the official Xinhua News Agency said.South Korea, which successfully tamed its first wave of infections, is seeing another rise. While the first outbreak was centered in its fourth-largest city, the current outbreak is in the Seoul region, where most South Koreans live. Authorities reported 51 cases Wednesday. Its increase of 40 to 50 cases every day over the past two weeks comes amid increased public activity and eased attitudes on social distancing.In India, with a population of more than 1.3 billion, the densely populated cities of Mumbai and New Delhi have been hardest hit. The country has reported more than 450,000 cases of the virus, including more than 14,000 deaths.The situation in New Delhi is a rising concern, with the federal government criticizing its poor contact tracing and a lack of hospital beds.Mexico reported nearly 800 new deaths on Wednesday. The country has recorded more than 190,000 cases and more than 23,000 deaths, although officials acknowledge both are undercounts due to extremely low testing rates. Mexico has performed only about half a million tests, or about one for every 250 inhabitants.Worldwide, more than 9.2 million people have contracted the virus, including more than 477,000 who have died, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-covid-19-cases-surge-to-highest-level-in-two-months/story-4iSFH3ljOhhMZc20TDt2MK.html

Air defenses were activated and reportedly intercepted a number of the incoming missiles.The official, who was not named, also said those attacks caused only material damage. But hours earlier, similar air raids on military posts in the south killed two soldiers and wounded four.The late Tuesday coordinated aerial attacks targeted military bases in the southern Sweida and the southeastern Deir el-Zour province. The defense ministry’s statement did not say who was behind the attacks, only that the aircraft flew over eastern Syria. It said the country’s air defense were activated.Israel rarely comments on such attacks in Syria. But in recent weeks, it has carried out several attacks on targets inside Syria, believed to be Iranian and proxy interests. In the past two months alone, Syria has accused Israel of carrying out at least eight air raids on its territory.In recent months, Israeli officials have expressed concern that Iranian-backed militant Lebanese group Hezbollah is trying to establish production facilities for precision guided missiles. Tension has also been rising along the Israel-Lebanon border.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said one of the targets attacked in Hama was a weapons depot used by an Iranian-backed militia near the town of Salamiya. That strike caused loud explosions that could be heard in the area, according to the Observatory. A private Syrian radio station Sham FM said three civilians in Hama were wounded by shrapnel from the attacks but did not specify where.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syria-reports-israeli-raids-on-central-south-military-posts/story-ifgMM7FrItylR20vlKRorN.html

But attitudes towards him on the proudly democratic island have become more conflicted.Chiang’s defeated Nationalist government fled to Taiwan after losing the Chinese civil in 1949.During the Cold War, he was backed strongly by the United States, and some Taiwanese still view him positively for standing up to Mao Zedong’s communism.But, many others revile him as a despot who imprisoned and killed opponents during a reign of terror. When he died in 1975, his son Chiang Ching-kuo took over and began tentative steps towards more political openness.Yvon Lin, 36, a Taipei city councillor for the small New Power Party, which supports Taiwan’s formal independence, said the question of what to do with statues of the Chiangs was problematical as they were such polarising figures.“Taiwan is quite special in that around half of people really support what the two Chiangs did in the past, so if we want to get rid of the symbols of authoritarianism these people could come out and protest,” Lin told Reuters.In the past few years some statues have been daubed with paint, often around the anniversary of a 1947 anti-government uprising, generally seen as the start of Chiang’s “white terror” campaign against dissent in Taiwan.His Nationalists took control of the island from Japan in 1945 at the end of World War Two.Nowadays, at the mausoleum in Taoyuan, outside Taipei, tourists pose for pictures as they gather round the statues depicting Chiang in various roles, from kindly father figure, to wise scholar, to military commander. Just as the Black Lives Matter movement has inspired a debate in Western countries over what to do with statues of people connected with the slave trade, Taiwan has also been coming to terms with a checkered history.Under 2017’s Act on Promoting Transitional Justice, symbols of Taiwan’s authoritarian era are supposed to be removed, renamed or “handled in other ways”. Yet enforcement is not specified, leaving local governments to make their own decisions.Taiwan independence protesters threw red paid on Chiang’s sarcophagus at the mausoleum two years ago, something visitor Lin He-sheng expressed regret about.“I don’t think there’s a need to be like that with someone who has died,” Lin told Reuters at the statue park. “You should look at his positive side. A person is not necessarily only about the negative.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-s-chiang-kai-shek-statues-draw-curious-crowds-and-controversy/story-21oXVl5CBN9MzSHluuI2XK.html

In most of Europe, the numbers of cases are roughly equal between men and women.“The numbers do not add up,” said Mearns.Testing is extremely limited in most low-income countries, and even more so in conflict zones, which is where the biggest gender gaps occurred, said the IRC.Women in conflict-hit areas often have difficulty accessing health services due to gender discrimination and inequality, the agency added.Globally, experts have warned that women may suffer the brunt of the virus’ impact because they are less likely to have health care, more likely to take on unpaid work and more likely to lose their jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-conflict-hit-countries-coronavirus-testing-may-not-reach-women/story-IkfBtPHkhaf2pEUd3t2DZN.html

Sentiment had plunged to an all-time low in April, and despite June’s jump remains depressed, as values below 90 are equivalent to a much weaker than normal economy.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage“All in all, sentiment is recovering from the initial shock, but is still gloomy and perhaps somewhat more pessimistic than expected,” Nordea economist Torbjorn Isaksson said. “The export industry continues to struggle. A good sign is households’ relatively optimistic view on their own financial situation.”The reading comes as economists and policy makers revise up their forecasts in light of better-than-expected consumer spending and unemployment data.According to Manuel Oliveri, an FX strategist at Credit Agricole, the rebound in confidence levels “continues to keep the risk for additional policy action low, irrespective of Riksbank members leaving all options open.”But Bloomberg economist Johanna Jeansson was less sanguine, while agreeing that “the most acute phase of the crisis has abated.”“Today’s survey is yet another sign that the most acute phase of the crisis has abated. But with both demand and supply below pre-pandemic levels, we expect the Riksbank and the Ministry of Finance will have to do more,” Johanna JeanssonUnlike its neighbors, Sweden avoided a strict lockdown as the coronavirus spread, keeping shops, schools and restaurants open. The lax strategy appears to have mitigated some of the economic damage caused by the pandemic, but at the cost of a relatively high death toll.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/swedish-confidence-levels-jump-as-covid-19-concern-recedes/story-BAcoXVWg00pkQKIvU6gZNM.html

They were thrown overboard,” he said, later telling Reuters that those that perished had fallen sick, without elaborating further.The fate of close to 500 Rohingya who had remained on “Motherboat 1” after the transfer at sea was unknown as authorities have been unable to track the vessel’s location, he said.The Rohingya had risked the perilous sea journey having lost hope of making a better life in the refugee camps in Bangladesh, where many had found sanctuary after fleeing their homes in Myanmar following a military crackdown in 2017.Mainly Muslim Malaysia is home to the second largest number of Rohingya refugees after Bangladesh.But in recent weeks, the Southeast Asian country has turned away at least two boats and detained hundreds of Rohingya and undocumented migrants, amid heightened public anger towards foreigners who have been accused of spreading the coronavirus and burdening state resources.Mohd Zubil said the Rohingya survivors, who have since been detained, had paid traffickers about 2,500 ringgit ($585) up front for the voyage, with a pledge to pay an additional 11,000-13,000 ringgit once they found jobs in Malaysia.Most of them were women promised for marriage to Rohingya men in Malaysia, he said.Mohd Zubil declined to comment on whether a decision had been made to push the detainees back out to sea once their boat is repaired, a reported proposal that has been criticised by human rights groups.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rohingya-refugees-tell-malaysia-how-dozens-perished-during-four-month-voyage/story-azk02p3tcZ1AHpAZ2kY7IN.html
24-06-2020||World||Israeli annexation plan draws apartheid comparisons||Benjamin Pogrund spent decades battling apartheid as a journalist in South Africa. Since moving to Israel two decades ago, he has passionately defended the country against charges that it too is an apartheid state.But at the age of 87, Pogrund is having second thoughts. He says that if Israel moves ahead with plans to annex parts of the West Bank, he will have no choice but to declare that his adopted homeland has become a modern-day version of apartheid-era South Africa.“There will be Israeli overlords in an occupied area. And the people over whom they will be ruling will not have basic rights,” Pogrund said in an interview in his leafy backyard garden. “That will be apartheid. And we will merit the charge. And that is something that worries me gravely because it exposes us to huge dangers.”Pogrund, a prolific author who is working on a new book about South African political history, says he feels so despondent he’s been unable to write about looming annexation.“I couldn’t bring myself to do it. Quite frankly, I just feel so bleak about it, that it is so stupid and ill-advised and arrogant,” he said.For years, Israel’s harshest detractors have labeled it an apartheid state to describe its rule over Palestinians who were denied basic rights in occupied areas. For the most part, Israel has successfully pushed back against the fraught word.But as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nears launching his annexation moves as part of President Donald Trump’s Mideast plan — perhaps as early as next month — the term is increasingly becoming part of Israel’s political conversation.Mainstream politicians who oppose annexation have begun to use the term. Disillusioned former military men bounce it around. Israel’s most popular political satire show, “Wonderful Country,” recently ran a spoof ad for a fictitious drone company that lifts Palestinians and flies them away from annexed land. The drone’s name: “Apart-High.”“When you start doing these unilateral actions, you actually put yourself on a very slippery slope,” said Gadi Shamni, a retired Israeli general who once commanded the West Bank. Inevitably, Palestinians in annexed areas will demand the rights of citizens, including the right to vote, which will “eventually create some kind of apartheid,” he warned.Apartheid refers to the system of racial discrimination enforced by South Africa’s white-minority regime from 1948 until 1994. It was characterized by separate housing and public facilities for blacks and whites, bans on interracial relations and disenfranchisement of the Black majority. Branded a pariah state, South Africa peacefully dismantled apartheid in 1994, when democratic elections brought Nelson Mandela to become its first Black president.Supporters of the Israeli government are outraged at comparisons to South Africa. They note that Israel’s Arab minority, about 20% of the population, can vote and, even if there is some discrimination, have risen high in business, politics and entertainment. They say the West Bank is “disputed,” not occupied, and defend Israel’s presence in the West Bank in terms of security or the deep Jewish connection to what religious Jews call biblical Judea and Samaria.The comparison is “deeply offensive,” said Eugene Kontorovich, head of the international law department at the Kohelet Policy Forum, a conservative think tank in Jerusalem that frequently advises Netanyahu’s government.“Apartheid was a system in which a minority white government in South Africa ruled over the Black majority,” he said. “They taxed them. They drafted them, and they passed every law under which they lived.”He said none of these conditions apply, with most Palestinians governed by the self-rule Palestinian Authority, which has limited autonomy in parts of the West Bank.Pogrund sees things differently, the result of his years of experience in South Africa.As a reporter and editor at the Rand Daily Mail in Johannesburg, Pogrund documented many of the horrors of apartheid.These included the infamous Sharpeville massacre in which South African police fired on black protesters, killing 69 people, and exposés about prison conditions and the torture of Black prison inmates. He was jailed for refusing to identify an informant, put on trial for his reporting, saw his home ransacked by police and sometimes required a bodyguard. He visited Mandela, a trusted source and friend, in prison. Last year, he received a “National Order,” one of South Africa’s most prestigious awards.Pogrund left South Africa after his newspaper was closed in 1985 under government pressure. After time in London and the United States, he moved to Israel in 1997.Pogrund is a vocal critic of Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians. He describes the West Bank occupation — in which Israeli settlers and Palestinians live under different sets of laws — with words like “tyrannical,” “oppression” and “brutality.” But he has always stopped short of calling it apartheid, believing the term is uniquely evil.“It’s a deadly word,” he said.Advocates of the term argue that it already is applicable in the West Bank because, despite the existence of the Palestinian Authority, Israel has ultimate, de facto control over the territory. It controls entry and exit, water and other resources and overall security. Under interim peace accords, it also maintains full control over 60% of the West Bank where all settlements are located and tens of thousands of Palestinians live but have no voice.As appalling as he finds the occupation, Pogrund has argued for years in articles, lectures and a 2014 book that the situation lacks the “intentionality” and “institutionalized” racism of South Africa.Where South Africa’s system was designed with the intent of creating second-class people based on their skin color, he believes Israel’s poor treatment of Palestinians are rooted in security concerns.“There’s discrimination. There’s oppression. It’s not apartheid,” he said.Pogrund said he began to have misgivings several years ago when the Israeli parliament passed its “Nation State Law,” which declared the country to be the “national home” of the Jewish people while appearing to downgrade the status of the Arab minority.“Annexation will take us right over the edge,” he said.In a recent interview, Netanyahu said Palestinians would remain in “enclaves” and “remain Palestinian subjects.” Some reports have suggested that Netanyahu may scale back the annexation to help minimize international criticism, but Pogrund says size doesn’t matter.During his time in London, he recalled a shopper picking up a package of grapes, seeing they were a product of South Africa and putting them down in disgust. He fears Israel will be in a similar position.“You’ll be carrying the apartheid stigma,” he said. “We are heading straight into self-inflicting (this) on our ourselves. We are applying apartheid, the hated word of the second half of the 20th century.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israeli-annexation-plan-draws-apartheid-comparisons/story-EqvDdclJ9VQvl2B52BlkRM.html
24-06-2020||World||Brazil tests Covid shot, without deal to use it if it works||Brazil is testing an experimental coronavirus vaccine, but interim Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello acknowledged Tuesday that the government has yet to strike a deal to get it if it works. Other nations have already secured hundreds of millions of doses of the shot created by Oxford University. The country’s pandemic response has faced criticism since March, when President Jair Bolsonaro started defying social distancing recommendations. Hours before Brazil’s health minister spoke at congress, a judge ordered Bolsonaro to wear a face mask whenever he is outdoors in the capital of Brasilia. Pazuello, an army general who made his career in logistics, discussed Brazil’s efforts to buy a vaccine for the virus or acquire the technology to make it. The country’s health regulator, Anvisa, approved human clinical trials for the potential vaccine this month. Pazuello said a decision on a deal for Brazil to acquire the planned vaccine is expected by the end of the week, but will depend on the government’s chief of staff.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage British researchers started testing the experimental shot in May aiming to immunize more than 10,000 people, including older people and children. The vaccine is one of about a dozen in early stages of human testing. Brazil, where coronavirus infections are still on the rise, is the only country other than the United Kingdom testing the Oxford vaccine. The country counts more than 1 million confirmed cases and more than 52,600 fatalities. Clinical trials began in Sao Paulo on Monday and will start in Rio de Janeiro on Wednesday. The British Embassy says 5,000 health professionals are being vaccinated. “We are working directly with the three most promising” vaccines, Pazuello said, naming the Oxford shot, a vaccine under development by American company Moderna and one of the Chinese experiments, which he did not disclose. Vijay Rangarajan, the British ambassador to Brazil, told The Associated Press he hopes Brazil will “be one of the first countries to receive the vaccine” if it works. “However, that will depend on when the country will sign the agreement,” he said by e-mail. “There is already production capacity for the vaccine of 2 billion doses worldwide. But much of the global production is already purchased.” On May 21, the United States announced a deal for at least 300 million doses of the Oxford shot, and committed up to USD 1.2 billion to the effort. On June 13, pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca agreed to supply up to 400 million doses of the experimental vaccine to European Union nations. Other negotiations are ongoing with Russia and Japan, among other countries, the company’s CEO said this month. The British ambassador also added he wants “to ensure Brazilians can benefit from any vaccine, quickly and not for profit.” Bolsonaro has been criticized for downplaying his government’s response to the pandemic, comparing the disease to “a little flu.” Prior to vaccine trials, Bolsonaro repeatedly touted the use of chloroquine to treat Covid-19, the disease that can be caused by the coronavirus, even as health experts dismissed its efficacy. The U.S. announced May 31 that it would donate 2 million doses of hydroxychloroquine, a similar anti-malarial that is considered less toxic, to the South American nation. The U.S. also pledged to donate 1,000 ventilators to Brazil. The first 200 ventilators are expected arrive by the end of this week, U.S. Ambassador Todd Chapman told reporters Tuesday in a video call. Another experimental vaccine in development by Chinese company Sinovac Biotech will be tested in Brazil in July, according to the Sao Paulo state government. Sinovac has a deal with the state’s Instituto Butantan to produce it. Some 9,000 Brazilians are expected to participate. Earlier Tuesday, a Brazilian federal judge ordered Bolsonaro to comply with local rules to wear a face mask or be fined. In recent weekends, a sometimes unmasked Bolsonaro has joined throngs of people protesting against Brazil’s Congress and Supreme Court and he has visited bakeries and outdoor food stalls, drawing crowds around him. Since the end of April, Brazil’s federal district has required people to wear face masks in public to help control the spread of the new coronavirus. Failure to comply carries a possible daily fine of USD 390. Judge Renato Coelho Borelli said in his ruling that Bolsonaro “has exposed other people to the contagion of a disease that has caused national commotion.” The Brazilian president did not immediately comment on the decision. An earlier court ruling required him to publish the results of three Covid-19 tests he took early March, and all were negative for the virus. He has not disclosed any tests since then. Bolsonaro sometimes appears in public events with a mask, unlike some other heads of state, including U.S. President Donald Trump, Mexico’s Andrés Manuel López Obrador and Argentina’s Alberto Fernandez, who has often hugged supporters and taken selfies with them while not wearing a mask, although use of a mask is mandatory in Argentina’s capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-tests-covid-shot-without-deal-to-use-it-if-it-works/story-5W3HtkgawRO2K8UeqrmENK.html
24-06-2020||World||Indian restaurant vandalised in New Mexico||An Indian restaurant owned by a Sikh in the Sante Fe city in the US state of New Mexico was broken into and vandalised with hate messages scrawled on its walls, according to a media report.The damage caused to India Palace restaurant is estimated to be worth USD 100,000, local Santa Fe Reporter newspaper reported on Tuesday. The vandalisation is being investigated by local police and the FBI, it said.The Sikh American Legal Defence and Education Fund (SALDEF), a non-profit civil rights organisation, has condemned the incident. “This kind of hate and violence is unacceptable and swift action must be taken to ensure the safety and security of all Americans,” said SALDEF executive director Kiran Kaur Gill. According to the local daily, tables were overturned, glassware was smashed into piles on the floor, wine racks were emptied, a statue of a goddess was beheaded and computers were stolen. The vandals also turned over and destroyed food warmers, while the front desk area was gutted, plates smashed and the kitchen rendered completely unusable, it said. “I walked into the kitchen, I saw everything and I was like, hold on, what? What is going on here?” owner Baljit Singh told Santa Fe Reporter. “White power,” “Trump 2020,” “go home,” and far worse were spray-painted on walls, doors, counters and any other available surface. “Some phrases contained threats of violence and derogatory racial slurs,” the daily said. “Santa Fe is a peaceful town, and the Sikh community has lived here, beautifully integrated, since the 60s,” said SALDEF board member Simran Singh, who lives minutes away from the restaurant. “Tensions have flared recently with the reinvigoration of the Black Lives Matter movement and the removal of statues associated with Spanish colonisers of this area, who committed a number of atrocities,” he said. “Nevertheless, we are seeing an outpouring of love and support around the city and in my experience, our neighbours love and appreciate us, as we love and appreciate them,” he added. SALDEF said that it has seen an unprecedented rise in hate crimes including the April 29 incident wherein a Sikh American Lakhwant Singh was brutally attacked by a man identified as Eric Breeman in Lakewood, Colorado. Lakhwant Singh was told to “go back to your country,” while being attacked. No formal hate crime charges have been brought against the attacker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-restaurant-vandalised-in-new-mexico/story-ZaZjRYNpBOpPHF4jAKjVBP.html

He told Reuters he had joined the new Progress Singapore Party (PSP). Lee has criticised his brother Lee Hsien Loong’s People’s Action Party (PAP), which their father founded and which has governed the city-state since its independence in 1965.Last year, Hsien Yang said that the PAP had “lost its way” and that he “supported the principles and values of the Progress Singapore Party.”The PSP is led by Tan Cheng Bock, a former PAP lawmaker who shot to prominence by nearly defeating a candidate backed by Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in the 2011 presidential race.“We will see,” Lee Hsien Yang replied when asked whether he would stand as a candidate. PSP said on Twitter that it welcomed Lee Hsien Yang as a member.“It’s time for change,” it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-pm-s-estranged-brother-joins-opposition-party-as-election-looms/story-0sUli0DR2wHgCKSeuzsyVI.html

The new virus casualty is an 80-year-old man in Victoria state. Australia has recorded 30 new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours -- 20 cases in Victoria and 10 in New South Wales.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage No new coronavirus infection has been recorded in Queensland for the seventh straight day. Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton said, “Seven (cases) are linked to known outbreaks. One has been detected in hotel quarantine. Nine through routine testing and three other cases are under investigation.” The official said there was a risk of more cases being hospitalised. He said there were 141 active cases in the state with over 1,000 close contacts needing to be traced. “It certainly means we’re not getting an increase or an exponential increase in community transmission cases day by day,” Sutton said. Health Minister Greg Hunt has said Australia is “as well prepared as any nation in the world” to stop the spread of coronavirus, but warned Melbourne residents to be diligent in following health norms. Earlier, Victoria Health Minister Jenny Mikakos indicated the state’s effective reproduction number (Reff), which calculates the rate of virus transmission per person, had rose to about 2.5 in the past week from below 1. Sutton said authorities wanted to keep Victoria’s effective reproduction number below one. “When it’s at two it means the active cases we have are doubling with each generation,” he said. “We have seen the community transmission figures go from single figures [of cases] to above ten. So it’s no surprise the Reff is at two or above. “But with the stabilisation in numbers in the last two days I expect that that will go back down and I absolutely hope that we can get it below one and drive those numbers back down to zero,” the minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-reports-first-coronavirus-death-in-more-than-a-month-total-cases-cross-7-500/story-jZ8kMcTzfNKcPajuECxfuN.html
24-06-2020||World||Trump’s brother sues over niece’s book about ‘toxic’ family||President Donald Trump’s brother sued to block publication of a book by their niece Mary Trump, saying portions of the memoir violate confidentiality provisions of a settlement reached among family members almost two decades ago in a fight over money.Robert S. Trump filed the complaint Tuesday in state court in Queens, New York, seeking an order permanently barring publication on the grounds that the book will include extensive private information. The memoir purports to have an “insider’s perspective” of “countless holiday meals” as well as family events and other potentially damaging information, according to a copy of the lawsuit.The suit was filed three days after a federal judge rejected the Trump administration’s request for a court order blocking publication of a damning memoir about the president by former national security adviser John Bolton. The judge in that case said Bolton had put the nation’s security at risk by publishing classified information but that too many advance copies had been sent out to justify an emergency order blocking publication.Mary Trump’s book, “Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World’s Most Dangerous Man,” which is due to be published on July 28, could also be damaging and will include purported psychological observations about her “toxic” family, according to the lawsuit. It’s also expected to reveal her role as a primary source for the New York Times’s investigation into the president’s taxes, and to detail her claim that the family’s mistreatment of her father, Fred Trump Jr., contributed to his early death.“I am deeply disappointed in my niece Mary’s decision to write a book concerning our family,” Robert Trump said in a statement. “Her attempt to sensationalize and mischaracterize our family relationship after all of these years for her own financial gain is both a travesty and injustice to the memory of my late brother Fred and our beloved parents.“I and the rest of my entire family are so proud of my wonderful brother, the president, and feel that Mary’s actions are truly a disgrace,” Robert Trump said.Robert Trump claims that details in the book are barred from publication by the 2001 global settlement over family disputes stemming from the wills of the president’s parents, Fred and Mary, who died in 1999 and 2000. His niece agreed as part of the deal not to “directly or indirectly publish or cause to be published any diary, memoir, letter, story, photograph, interview, article, essay, account or description or depiction of any kind whatsoever” about their relationships, according to the complaint.Mary Trump received “adequate consideration” for joining the settlement, the suit claims, though financial details weren’t disclosed in the filing. Dozens of pages of heavily redacted court documents from the litigation resolved by the settlement were also included in the filing.The book’s publisher, Simon & Schuster, which provided a copy of the lawsuit, was also named in the complaint.“As the plaintiff and his attorney well know, the courts take a dim view of prior restraint, and this attempt to block publication will meet the same fate as those that have gone before,” the publisher said in a statement. “Mary Trump has written a compelling personal story of worldwide significance, and we look forward to helping her tell her story.”Mary Trump’s lawyer, Theodore Boutrous Jr., called the lawsuit a “brazen effort to squelch speech” in violation of the First Amendment.“President Trump and his siblings are seeking to suppress a book that will discuss matters of utmost public importance,” Boutrous said in a statement. “They are pursuing this unlawful prior restraint because they do not want the American people to know the truth.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-s-brother-sues-over-niece-s-book-about-toxic-family/story-MkQMkGnQvsH0XKRpu2SfDP.html
24-06-2020||World||Chinese Covid-19 vaccines cleared for final testing in UAE||A Chinese state-owned vaccine developer secured regulatory approval to test its coronavirus shots in the United Arab Emirates, making it one of the first among a slew of global efforts to get the greenlight for the final stage of human trials.Beijing-based China National Biotec Group Co. was awarded approval on Tuesday to conduct Phase III trials for its Covid-19 vaccines in the Middle Eastern country, the company said in a statement posted on its official WeChat account.CNBG said it will partner with Abu Dhabi-based artificial intelligence and cloud computing firm G42 to carry out the trial and local production of the vaccine. It didn’t disclose details such as the timing or the number of people it plans to enroll for testing.The world’s fast-developing vaccine programs are moving into the final stage of testing before they are approved for innoculation for the general public. Pharmaceutical companies across the globe are racing to be first to find an effective shot against the novel coronavirus, which has infected more than 9.2 million people and killed over 476,000.CNBG is the first Chinese vaccine developer to proceed toward a Phase III trial to test whether the two shots it developed are effective against the pathogen.Chinese companies have had to look for places with active virus outbreaks to complete the final stage of human testing, which requires thousands of people. The low number of cases in China has made it unfeasible for them to conduct such trials at home. The UAE is still adding hundreds of cases a day, with a total of more than 45,000 infections.Chinese biotech CanSino Biologics Inc. was approved last month to conduct human testing for the vaccine it co-developed with the Chinese military in Canada, but will need to re-do early safety studies before going into the Phase III trial. Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech Ltd. has partnered with Instituto Butantan to roll out testing of its shot on 9,000 people in the hot spot of Brazil, but has not yet won approval to proceed.Vaccine candidates from companies outside of China are also headed for Phase III trials. A shot co-developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca Plc will be tested among 2,000 people in Brazil starting as early as this month. Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna Inc. is set to begin testing its shot next month in a 30,000-person trial in the US. The two shots developed by CNBG have already been tested among some 2,000 people in phase I and II trials conducted in China. One of the vaccines has been found to be generally safe, while data from the other one will be revealed on June 28. The shots were already administered on more than 1,000 employees, including senior executives of CNBG and its parent company.Employees of Chinese state-run companies are said to have also been offered voluntary shots of the CNBG vaccines if they are traveling for work overseas or if they live in high-risk areas in Beijing, which has recently seen a fresh virus outbreak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-covid-19-vaccines-cleared-for-final-testing-in-uae/story-uvpQbcG3c6VY0TqHMAWDfO.html
24-06-2020||World||UN chief hopes Israel decides against West Bank annexation||UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed hope Tuesday that Israel will hear global calls and will not go ahead with annexation of parts of the West Bank, which would undermine a two-state solution to the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict.The UN chief said in an interview with The Associated Press that the United Nations has been consistently conveying the message “that annexation would be not only against international law but it would be a major factor to destabilize the region.”He spoke ahead of a high-level UN Security Council meeting Wednesday morning on the Mideast where Israel’s plans to annex around 30% of the West Bank in line with President Donald Trump’s Middle East peace plan is certain to be a major topic.Guterres will speak before briefings from Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit and UN Special Coordinator for the Middle East Nickolay Mladenov. France, which holds the council presidency this month, said half a dozen foreign ministers are expected to take part, along with the Palestinian foreign minister and Israel’s UN ambassador.Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast war and has built dozens of settlements that are now home to nearly 500,000 Israelis, but it never formally claimed it as an Israeli territory due to stiff international opposition.The Palestinians, with wide international backing, seek the territory as the heartland of their future independent state. Most of the international community considers Israel’s West Bank settlements illegal under international law.The Trump administration has taken a much softer line toward Israeli settlements than its predecessors. With Trump’s reelection prospects uncertain this November, Israeli hard-liners have urged Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to move ahead with annexation quickly. The Israeli leader’s new coalition deal includes an official clause allowing him to present his annexation plan to the government starting July 1.Such a unilateral move would all but dash Palestinian hopes of establishing a viable independent state and is vehemently opposed by the Palestinians, Arab nations and most of the rest of the world.Guterres said annexation “would undermine what I believe is necessary, which is a two-state solution in which Israelis and the Palestinians can live together in peace, respect each other, and guarantee each other’s security.”“I hope that this voice of reason that is not only mine, it is echoing across the world, will be heard by the Israeli authorities and that annexation does not take place on July 1,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-hopes-israel-decides-against-west-bank-annexation/story-4qmNrP2mkieZMOaQ6VhSbJ.html

The White House made clear on Monday that no such request was made.Fauci also said on Tuesday the US was currently seeing a disturbing surge of infections in a number of states like Texas, Florida and Arizona. He said one reason infections were rising in those states was an increase in community spread.“Right now the next couple of weeks are going to be critical in our ability to address those surges we are seeing in Florida, Texas, Arizona, and other states,” he said. Click here for Covid-19 live coverageUS health officials last week warned that states seeing a spike in Covid-19 cases may need to reimpose strict restrictions similar to what was implemented in March.Giroir said the country would be able to produce 180 million N95 respirators per month by fall.N95 masks are essential for protecting healthcare professionals from the coronavirus and are in short supply in many places, leading the Trump administration to invoke the Defense Production Act to boost supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-hasn-t-asked-us-to-slow-testing-us-covid-19-task-force-members/story-brLK6kuThEt4i6bXWo95FM.html
24-06-2020||World||Putin stages military show of strength with key vote approaching||President Vladimir Putin is putting Russia’s military might on display Wednesday in a parade to mark the 75th anniversary of the World War II defeat of Nazi Germany, ahead of a referendum that may allow him to rule until 2036.The spread of the coronavirus epidemic forced Putin to delay his annual May 9 Victory Day celebration on Moscow’s Red Square, which this year features 14,000 troops and weaponry including tanks, air-defense systems and nuclear-missile launchers.The commemoration of what’s known as the Great Patriotic War in Russia, in which 27 million citizens of the Soviet Union were killed, takes place a week before the July 1 referendum on constitutional changes backed by the Kremlin. They include a measure that would allow Putin to seek two more six-year terms once the current one, his fourth, ends in 2024.Putin, 67, has said the changes already endorsed by Russia’s parliament and Constitutional Court will only take effect if a majority of people support them in the referendum. While there’s little doubt the Kremlin will secure approval for the measures, officials are eager to ensure a high turnout for the vote.Putin had attached particular importance to this year’s anniversary, inviting leaders of Western wartime allies to join him in Moscow even as they continue to sanction Russia for its 2014 annexation of Crimea from Ukraine. French President Emmanuel Macron accepted Putin’s invitation to attend on May 9 before the pandemic upended Russia’s plans.While Putin has said Russia passed the peak of the epidemic, the country is still reporting more than 7,000 new daily infections, including about 1,000 in Moscow. About 30 Russian cities have either suspended plans to stage local WWII parades or banned spectators, citing risks to public health.Only about 10 foreign leaders are expected to join Putin for the parade, mostly from ex-Soviet states as well as the heads of the breakaway Georgian territories of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic is attending. Croatian President Zoran Milanovic canceled plans to come at the last minute, saying the presidential plane had broken down.The leaders of China, France, Israel, Japan and the Czech Republic were among those who declined to come. Russia didn’t invite Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy amid the continued dispute over Crimea and the war involving Kremlin-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine.While Moscow Mayor Sergei Sobyanin has advised the capital’s residents to stay home to watch the parade, he hasn’t banned spectators from the streets. Large-scale rehearsals by Russia’s military have been taking place.On the stands in Red Square, invited guests are being seated apart from each other to reduce any infection risks, health officials have said. Nearly 80 veterans who were selected to sit with Putin at the parade were isolated in a resort outside Moscow for 14 days to protect the Russian leader from possible exposure to the deadly pathogen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-stages-military-show-of-strength-with-key-vote-approaching/story-wADrc2axxGSAGclXSrsDuJ.html
24-06-2020||World||Seattle police investigate new shooting near autonomous zone||Seattle police on Tuesday said they were investigating a third shooting in the Capitol Hill neighborhood near the city’s “autonomous zone,” a day after the mayor vowed to dismantle the encampment set up by anti-racism protesters. Police tweeted the shooting took place on the edge of the Capitol Hill Organized Protest (CHOP), or Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, where demonstrators set up a police-free zone in the wake of George Floyd’s death in Minneapolis police custody.A man was taken to Harborview Medical Center at 5 a.m. after being shot near Cal Anderson Park and was in satisfactory condition, hospital spokeswoman Susan Gregg said. Police did not immediately respond to a request for further comment.There have been no reports indicating that the shooting on the edge of Cal Anderson Park was related to the occupation zone.The incident was the third shooting in the area in around 72 hours, police said. Seattle Mayor Jenny Durkan, facing local and national pressure to crack down on the protests, said on Monday officials would move to wind down the blocks-long, autonomous zone set up two weeks ago. Protesters took over several blocks around the Seattle Police Department’s East Precinct building, which police vacated. She did not give a deadline but said officers would soon move back to the precinct.President Donald Trump on Saturday said the occupation was an example of what “radical left Democrats” allowed in the United States and offered to help end the “anarchist” protest “in an hour or less.”On Tuesday, he tweeted that there would never be an “autonomous zone” in Washington D.C. and any attempt to establish one “will be met with serious force!” Twitter Inc on Tuesday placed a warning notice on the tweet because it violated its policy against abusive behavior.Protests and demonstrations against police brutality have spread around the world since George Floyd, a Black man, died after a police officer knelt on his neck for nearly nine minutes while detaining him in Minneapolis on May 25.Protesters have also demanded authorities take down monuments honoring pro-slavery Confederate figures and the architects of Europe’s colonies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seattle-police-investigate-new-shooting-near-autonomous-zone/story-3dfJjPJLjyAzE2e6AtLH7H.html
24-06-2020||World||Louisville police officer fired over fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor||One of three officers involved in the shooting death of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed in a hail of gunfire when drug investigators burst into her home in Louisville, Kentucky, three months ago was dismissed from the police department on Tuesday.Taylor, a 26-year-old emergency medical technician, was killed on March 13 after the officers entered her apartment bearing a “no-knock” arrest warrant. In a termination notice issued after an administrative hearing, Louisville police chief Robert Schroeder wrote that detective Brett Hankison “displayed an extreme indifference to the value of human life” when he “wantonly and blindly fired” 10 rounds into Taylor’s home.Schroeder said the gunshots were fired through a patio door and window covered with material obscuring Hankison’s line of sight, preventing him from knowing whether anyone was inside the apartment, let alone whether they posed a threat. Some of the rounds he fired flew into the unit next door, the chief wrote.Two other officers involved in the raid remain on administrative reassignment. No criminal charges have been filed against any of the three.The notice also said Hankison, who joined the department in 2003, was disciplined in 2019 for reckless conduct that injured an innocent person. Taylor’s slaying, which returned to prominence following the May 25 death in Minneapolis police custody of George Floyd, has become a rallying cry in nationwide protests against police brutality and racial bias in the U.S. criminal justice system.In the immediate aftermath of the Taylor killing, police said the officers had knocked on the door before forcing entry and were shot at by Taylor’s boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. One officer was struck in the leg, and all three returned fire, hitting Taylor at least eight times, according to the Louisville Courier-Journal.Walker was charged with attempted murder and assault, but prosecutors later dropped the charges, the Courier-Journal reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/louisville-police-officer-fired-over-fatal-shooting-of-breonna-taylor/story-w22P0yXdURcDMshfhbJMOP.html

24-06-2020||World||Kim Jong Un suspends planned military moves against South Korea||Kim Jong Un ordered the suspension of military actions against South Korea, a move that could ease tensions after North Korea blew up a liaison office built by Seoul and warned of further provocations.Kim “took stock of the prevailing situation and suspended the military action plans against the south” during a military commission meeting for his ruling Worker’s Party of Korea, the official Korean Central News Agency said Wednesday, without elaborating. The report was published the day before the 70th anniversary of the start of the Korean War in 1950, a milestone that had prompted speculation about further escalation by Pyongyang.Meanwhile, South Korea detected signs that North Korea was removing about 10 loudspeakers intended for propaganda broadcasts along border, the Yonhap News Agency reported, citing unidentified government officials. The speakers were only recently reinstalled amid tensions between the two sides.Kim’s regime last week threatened to send troops back into disarmed areas near the border with South Korea and bring back operations at 10 front-line guard posts that were shut down as part of an agreement with South Korean President Moon Jae-in. The liaison office in the North Korean border city of Kaesong was the most concrete achievement from a series of summits between the two Korean leaders in 2018 before it was “tragically ruined with a terrific explosion,” as KCNA announced.“It’s loosening the choke hold just enough for the South to breathe a short sigh of relief,” said Soo Kim, a Rand Corp. policy analyst. “But I would not read this as North Korea’s about-face from its continued trajectory of pressuring the South.”While Kim left the door open for more provocations by suspending, and not canceling, military action, his regime has climbed down from similar warnings before. In December, a top cadre warned the Trump administration of a “Christmas present” after demanding concessions in nuclear talks, but North Korea didn’t deliver on that threat. In 2017, North Korea warned of a strike against the US territory of Guam that never materialized.This month, North Korea ordered its troops into Kaesong, which is also home to a deserted inter-Korean industrial complex -- as well as the Mount Kumgang tourist area, another symbolic joint project that involved both nations. In recent days, it has looked to send millions of leaflets into its neighbor denouncing Moon’s government, in retaliation against similar messages lofted north of the border by North Korean defectors.The anti-Kim leaflets prompted the leader’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, to issue an unusual statement saying that it was “high time” to break ties with South Korea and North Korea subsequently blew up the $15 million liaison office. Moon -- a long-time proponent of peace -- criticized the action, while reaffirming his support for restoring economic ties with his country’s rival.Moon has found himself squeezed between North Korea’s demands to ease up on sanctions squeezing its paltry economy with more hawkish views in the Trump administration backing a maximum pressure campaign to force Kim to give up his nuclear weapons. A North Korea official dismissed the deals signed between Moon and Kim Jong Un as “scrap paper,” describing the South Korean president as the “chief culprit” for their failure.Although Kim Jong Un has not been nearly as critical as his younger sister, he has shown increasing frustration with President Donald Trump. The US president has refused to relax sanctions after three face-to-face meetings with Kim failed to produced what they US side viewed as an acceptable plan to scale back North Korea’s nuclear program.The Kim regime has a big incentive to keep tensions from getting out of control and prompting more international sanctions. North Korea’s economy faces fresh hardships because of borders being shut because of the coronavirus pandemic.“North Korea made a provocation out of pyrotechnics, something that literally made a big bang and heightened the perception of tensions, but didn’t push things so far that Pyongyang couldn’t later gain leverage in the process of de-escalating and negotiating a resolution,” said Mintaro Oba, a former US diplomat who specialized in Korean Peninsula issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kim-jong-un-suspends-planned-military-moves-against-south-korea/story-w6UVAShw4EbSARvTfkRlhL.html
24-06-2020||World||North Korea suspends military action plans against South Korea||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has presided over a meeting of the ruling party’s Central Military Commission and decided to suspend military action plans against South Korea, the official KCNA news agency reported on Wednesday.The video conference meeting on Tuesday also discussed documents outlining measures for “further bolstering the war deterrent of the country,” KCNA reported.The committee members “took stock of the prevailing situation” before deciding to suspend the military plans, the report said, without elaborating.Political tensions between the rival Koreas have been rising over Pyongyang’s objections to plans by defector-led groups in the South to fly propaganda leaflets over to the North.North Korea claims the moves violate an agreement between the two aimed at preventing military confrontation, and accused the defectors of insulting the dignity of North Korea’s supreme leadership.In recent weeks the North blew up a joint liaison office on its side of the border, declared an end to dialogue with the South, and threatened military action.Kim’s sister, Kim Yo Jong, warned last week of retaliatory measures against South Korea that could involve the military, without elaborating.The General Staff of the Korean People’s Army (KPA) later said it had been studying an “action plan” that included sending troops into joint tourism and economic zones, reoccupying border guard posts that had been abandoned under an inter-Korean pact, taking steps to “turn the front line into a fortress,” and supporting plans for the North to send its own propaganda leaflets into the South.North Korea’s military was seen putting up loudspeakers near the demilitarised zone (DMZ), a military source told Reuters on Tuesday. Such systems were taken down after the two Koreas signed an accord in 2018 to cease “all hostile acts.”A report by the North Korea-monitoring website 38 North on Tuesday said that anti-South Korea rhetoric from the North over the past week had left room for flexibility.However, “even if North Korea avoids a serious escalation of tensions, it is still unlikely to pursue further diplomacy with (South Korean President Moon Jae-in’s) administration anytime in the near future,” the report said. It predicted that Pyongyang could soon turn to more heated criticism of the United States.It was unclear if the fact that the meeting was conducted by video was aimed at ensuring social distancing.North Korea has taken stringent steps to prevent an outbreak of the novel coronavirus, and has said it has zero confirmed cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-suspends-military-action-plans-against-south-korea/story-B6LTQT9wU7iHHy38NoVarK.html
24-06-2020||World||Texas hits 5,000 new Covid-19 cases for first time as virus surges||Rapidly worsening coronavirus numbers in Texas reached bleak new milestones Tuesday as the state surpassed 5,000 new cases in a single day for the first time and hospitalizations again hit record numbers, leading the largest pediatric hospital in the US to begin treating adult patients in Houston.Republican Gov. Greg Abbott stressed that the public “comprehend the magnitude of the challenge” ahead and, in a first since Texas lifted lockdown orders in May, empowered cities and counties to immediately put tighter restrictions on large gatherings.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe move reflected a more urgent tone Abbott is now taking after previously asserting that Texas’ rising numbers raised concerns, but not alarms. Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation’s top infectious disease expert, told lawmakers in Washington on Tuesday that “the next couple weeks are going to be critical” in Texas and other states that are trying to curtail an alarming spike in new cases.It was only last weekend that Texas surpassed 4,000 cases in a single day for the first time. On Tuesday, the record shot up to more than 5,400 new cases, and although Texas is testing more people, the rate of people testing positive inched closer to 10 percent — the highest it has been since mid-April, when Texas was still under stay-at-home orders.Abbott says shutting down the economy again is a last resort. He is now emphasizing face coverings more strenuously than at any point during the pandemic but continues to resist calls from cities, business groups and teachers to make masks mandatory.“There remain a lot of people in the state of Texas who think that the spread of Covid-19 is not a challenge,” Abbott told Bryan television station KBTX. “The coronavirus is serious. It’s spreading.”Infection rates in Texas has doubled since late May, and on Tuesday, the state reached an 12th consecutive day of record Covid-19 hospitalizations with more than 4,000. That amounts to a more than 170 percent increase in hospitalizations since Memorial Day, although Abbott and the Texas Hospital Association have stressed there remains ample capacity for now.However, some of the state’s largest medical centers are beginning to carve out more space.Texas Children’s Hospital, the largest pediatric hospital in the United States, said Tuesday it was admitting adult patients across its campuses to free up more hospital bed space in the Houston area. The number of Covid-19-positive hospital patients in Harris County, which encompasses Houston, has nearly tripled since May 31.Houston this week joined other big cities in Texas that took advantage of Abbott allowing them to force businesses to impose face mask policies for customers. Early on during the pandemic, Abbott took away the ability of cities and counties to set their own Covid-19 restrictions, but on Tuesday he ceded some power back and allowed them to impose restrictions of outdoor gatherings of more than 100 people.The move comes ahead of the July 4th holiday, when public health officials have expressed new worries about large crowds.Despite the surge, Abbott and state education officials have said it will be safe to reopen public schools in August. Local officials will decide safety measures such as masks, but the Texas State Teachers Association on Tuesday demanded a statewide order requiring masks for students and staff when class resumes for the fall semester.“The governor can preach the benefits of wearing a mask all he wants, but as long as he continues to dodge responsibility for issuing a mask order, some school officials won’t require them, and health risks for students and school employees will rise,” said Noel Candelaria, the association’s president.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms that clear up within weeks. But for others, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, the highly contagious virus can cause severe illness, including pneumonia, and be fatal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/texas-hits-5-000-new-covid-19-cases-for-first-time-as-virus-surges/story-zZ4C1rg74NF9KSAbimIRPK.html

It was also the worst episode of aviation-related terrorism till 9/11.Among those who commemorated the day was Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. In a message, he said, “Thirty-five years ago today, an explosion on Air India Flight 182, bound for the United Kingdom from Canada, killed the 329 innocent people on board, including 280 Canadians. The attack was an act of unspeakable malice and remains the deadliest terrorist attack in Canadian history. It was a shock to our country, and a threat to our collective sense of security.”June 23 is recognised as the National Day of Remembrance for Victims of Terrorism in Canada.Trudeau’s message was among those posted on a special YouTube channel created by family members to honour their departed kin. Very few were able to visit any of the four memorials to the tragedy in Canada - in Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa and Montreal. But many family members posted their memorial messages on the channel which became the venue for a virtual gathering for the mourners.“It’s difficult for us as no large gathering are allowed,” Bal Gupta, chair of the Air India 182 Victims Families Association, said. “But we have to obey the rules,” he added. The memorials, particularly the one at Humber Bay in Toronto, often attract over a 100 visitors on the anniversary. As that was not possible this year, the Association informed its members they could mark the day by posting video messages.Many family members did visit the memorials, though none did so as part of a group because of the restrictions.India’s High Commissioner to Ottawa Ajay Bisaria paid his respects at the memorial in Canada’s capital, and sent a message to the family members that this “was a Canadian tragedy, an Indian tragedy, a global tragedy.” His Irish counterpart Jim Kelly was another visitor. Debris from the bombed aircraft had washed up along the shores of Ireland and it also hosts a memorial to the victims.Brenda Lucki, Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) Commissioner, also sent a message to the family members in which she stressed the investigation into the act of terrorism is still on, saying the law enforcement agency “continues its effort to seek justice, to this day”.Others who paid their respects were the Premiers of Ontario and British Columbia, Doug Ford and John Horgan, the Mayors of Toronto and Ottawa, and India’s Consul General in Toronto Apoorva Srivastava.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-35th-anniversary-of-kanishka-bombing-marked-with-virtual-vigil-in-canada/story-9Up5NUJCi8hcZgUpHTll3J.html

Whatever you’ve done so far is not enough.”The virtual fundraiser collected $7.6 million from 175,000 grassroots contributors. Obama and Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, also hosted a private online portion for high-dollar donors, which was not open to reporters and brought in more than $3.4 million.The haul was the most for any Biden campaign event, coming on the heels of the Democratic Party and Biden’s campaign outraising Republican President Donald Trump in May for the first time.Tuesday’s fundraiser showed the drawing power of Obama, who remains overwhelmingly popular among the Democratic base and who will be counted on as a key campaign figure this autumn.It also highlighted the dramatic changes the coronavirus pandemic has wrought on traditional campaigning, with the two politicians sharing a split screen from their living rooms, while supporters tuned in via livestream.Early in the 2020 campaign, Biden’s weak fundraising numbers compared with some of his Democratic competitors were a source of concern. But his fundraising from donors has picked up in recent weeks as his lead in national opinion polls grew and the country reacted to incidents of police brutality.Trump, who has been campaigning for a second term since 2017, still has far more cash on hand ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.His campaign noted in a statement that it raised more than $10 million last weekend, when the president appeared in Oklahoma for his first live campaign rally since the outbreak erupted.“There is no enthusiasm for Joe Biden,” said Tim Murtaugh, a Trump campaign spokesman.‘MEAN-SPIRITED’Obama, who has only occasionally criticized Trump since leaving office in 2017, faulted his successor’s behavior several times on Tuesday, saying he “exploits” divisions among Americans and calling his approach to governing “mean-spirited.”“There is no disconnect between the urgency of this election and the political moment and what has been happening on the streets,” said Obama, referring to the civil rights protests that have swept across major cities since George Floyd, a Black man, died last month after a white Minneapolis police officer kneeled on his neck for more than eight minutes.Obama also criticized Trump for ignoring advice from public health experts on how to handle the coronavirus and for giving cover to authoritarian governments by attacking the free press and advocating military force against protesters.“There’s a big contest, not just in this country but around the world, about who we are,” Obama said.Biden, who has an extensive foreign policy record both as a US senator and as vice president, said he would pick up the phone on his first day in office with a simple message to allies around the world: “America is back.”As the event ended, Obama said: “Love you, Joe.”“Love you too, pal,” Biden responded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/obama-helps-raise-11-million-in-first-campaign-event-for-biden-s-white-house-bid/story-B06CfdHMyHeO7ZsSgGkdZM.html

The League also welcomed a call by the United Nations for a resumption of talks.The latest US-backed negotiations between Egypt, Ethiopia and mutual neighbor Sudan ended last week with Ethiopia refusing to accept a permanent, minimum volume of water that the dam should release downstream in the event of severe drought. Egypt, which relies on the Nile for almost all its fresh water, has described any filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam without such a deal as illegal.Ethiopia says that a so-called declaration of principles agreement signed by Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan in 2015 allows it to proceed with damming the GERD.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-sudan-water-rights-a-matter-of-arab-security-league-says/story-mr9q780h5pKginUIDhRz7I.html

24-06-2020||World||UN chief criticises lack of global cooperation on Covid-19||The United Nations chief criticised the total lack of international coordination in tackling the Covid-19 pandemic and warned that the go-it-alone policy of many countries will not defeat the coronavirus. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in an interview with The Associated Press that what needs to be done is to make countries understand that by acting in isolation “they are creating the situation that is getting out of control” — and that global coordination is key. Click here for full Covid-19 coverageCovid-19 started in China, moved to Europe, then to North America and now to South America, Africa and India, he said, and some people are now talking about second waves coming at any moment. Yet, he said, “there is total lack of coordination among countries in the response to the Covid.” Guterres said it’s important to use that fact “to make countries understand that bringing them together, putting together their capacities, not only in fighting the pandemic in a coordinated way but in working together to have the treatments, testing mechanisms, the vaccines … accessible to everybody, that this is the way we defeat the pandemic.” The secretary-general said coordinating political, economic and social responses to the fallout from Covid-19 including job losses, increasing violence and human rights being violated will also help mitigate the impact of the pandemic. From the start of the pandemic, Guterres has been trying to mobilize international action to address what he says is the biggest international challenge since World War II. He called for a global cease-fire to all conflicts on March 23 to tackle Covid-19 but the response has been very limited. And his calls, and repeated calls by the World Health Organization chief, for international “solidarity” to fight against Covid-19 have not led to significant changes in nationalist approaches to dealing with the virus.  “I am frustrated, of course, with the lack of international cooperation at the present moment,” Guterres said, “but I hope that the new generations will be able to make things change in the future.”  The secretary-general didn’t single out any countries, but US President Donald Trump halted all funding to the World Health Organization, accusing the UN agency leading the fight against the pandemic of failing to respond to the coronavirus because China has “total control” over it. Trump has pushed for the US economy to reopen as Covid-19 cases continue to rise in many American states. About 2.3 million Americans have been infected by the virus and some 120,000 have died, according to data from Johns Hopkins University. The pandemic is also still on the rise in Brazil, where there are more than 1 million confirmed Covid-19 cases and almost 52,000 fatalities. The country’s response has faced criticism since March when President Jair Bolsonaro started defying social distancing recommendations. Britain has the highest coronavirus death toll in Europe, at over 42,000, and the Conservative government has been sharply criticised for what many see as its slow, muddled response to fighting the pandemic.  “I think we need to promote humility,” Guterres said, “because it’s only based on humility that we’ll understand our opportunity, and understanding our opportunity we understand the need to have solidarity and unity.” The secretary-general said he sees “an enormous movement of solidarity” in societies and communities, and more voices saying, for example, that a vaccine must be “a people’s vaccine, not a vaccine in a commercial dispute among countries to make the rich benefit from it and the poor not.” “So, when I listen to the voices of the youth, when I listen to the voices of civil society, I see there the seeds that hopefully will quantify in a much better coordination in the future around response to pandemics like this one,” Guterres said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-chief-criticises-lack-of-global-cooperation-on-covid-19/story-P9jyBZPQqeIdyDEOVjAIpO.html
24-06-2020||World||Boris Johnson gambles on lifting lockdown to save UK’s economy||Boris Johnson has launched the biggest gamble of his premiership, announcing that July will see a dramatic lifting of the lockdown measures imposed in England in March. The goal is to save the economy. The risk is that it causes a second spike in coronavirus infections.At a news conference on Tuesday evening -- the final such daily event, Johnson said, in a signal that he wants Britons to stop feeling that they’re living through a crisis -- the prime minister was clear that he took full responsibility for the decision. The scientists flanking him were were clear about the dangers, and warned that the virus will be with the U.K. into 2021.The problem faced by Johnson is balancing the potential harm of increased virus spread with the damage being done to Britain’s economy every day of the lockdown. Earlier Tuesday, government figures showed that the two main work-support programs had so far cost more than 30 billion pounds ($38 billion). Ministers worry about how many of the 9.2 million jobs being supported will disappear once the programs end.Johnson’s message to the public was clear: Get out of your homes and get spending. “It’s great to see people out shopping again,” he said. “I can’t wait to go to a pub or a restaurant. People need to enjoy themselves.”Johnson Re-Opens England’s Pubs But Scientists Warn of Long HaulAt the end of his answer, he inserted a crucial caveat: “I also want to see everybody being careful and following the guidance.” And he repeated that if the virus began to spread again, he would reimpose restrictions.But his emphasis was clear. Pubs, restaurants and hotels can reopen from July 4. To give their businesses a chance of working, the advice to people to keep a 2 meter distance from others has been changed: The distance is now 1 meter, so long as other mitigating measures are in place.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland will make their own decisions about how and when to ease the lockdown.This means that for all Johnson’s drive to get life back to normal, it will still feel very different in July. Pubs will have to introduce table service and ordered queues, to replace the usual crowd at the bar trying to catch the landlord’s eye. Churches can open, but without singing. Weddings can go ahead, but with a maximum of 30 guests.In early March, the scientists advising the government warned that to lock down too early would risk a frustrated public starting to simply ignore it. Now the fear is in the opposite direction, that consumers will be too nervous to come out and spend.A poll from YouGov in mid-June found only 26% of people saying they’d be comfortable visiting a pub -- though twice that said they’d be happy to sit in the garden of one. In an effort to boost confidence, ministers spent Tuesday tweeting about their enthusiasm to get into a pub again -- even Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak, who doesn’t drink.Cautions, CalculationsBut if the politicians were sending one signal, the scientists were sending a quite different one. Chief Medical Officer Chris Whitty, standing alongside Johnson, warned: “If people hear a distorted version of what’s been said that says ‘this is all fine now, it’s gone away’ and start to behave in ways that they normally would have before the virus, then we will get an uptick, for sure.”Johnson’s calculation is that the U.K. is better-placed than it was in March to face such a rise. Its testing capacity is greatly expanded, it has many more ventilators, and the treatment of Covid-19 is better understood.But despite Johnson’s attempt to argue that the country was proceeding on the course to ease the lockdown that he set out in May, things have not been going entirely to plan. In the last seven days, an average 121 people died from the disease a day, and the average number of infections detected was 1,147. The mobile phone app that was supposed to sit at the heart of the contact-tracing program is nowhere in sight.And also on Tuesday, the Office for National Statistics reported that between Jan. 1 and June 12, there were 54,402 more deaths in England and Wales than average, another sign that the U.K. has been the hardest-hit country in Europe.While Johnson was trying to get the country to move on from the virus, there was a reminder that elsewhere too, politics can be difficult. Despite having a parliamentary majority of 80, the prime minister suffered his first defeat, on a vote about disciplinary procedures for members of the House of Commons, after 45 Conservatives voted against the party whip, including his predecessor Theresa May and Treasury Minister Penny Mordaunt.

Beijing’s mass testing of millions of its residents is on after a new cluster of cases emerged in late May.The Chinese capital reported 13 newly confirmed domestically-transmitted Covid-19 cases, two suspected infections and one asymptomatic on Monday, the municipal health commission said on Tuesday. From June 11 to 22, Beijing has reported 249 confirmed domestically-transmitted cases, all of whom were receiving treatment in hospitals, it said. Twenty-two asymptomatic cases are still under medical observation, it said. Just as the health officials of Beijing began to announce that the new coronavirus attack is getting under control, a delivery man from China’s leading food delivery platform ele.me in the city was confirmed to be infected with Covid-19. According to health authorities in Beijing, the 47-year-old delivery man had been offering services across a wide area in the capital between June 1 and June 17, involving the streets of Daxing, Fangshan, Dongcheng and Fengtai districts. It is the first case in the food delivery industry to have been confirmed in the capital, sparking widespread public concerns as residents rely heavily on delivery services for necessities amid the epidemic, sate-run Global Times reported on Tuesday. The patient delivered 50 orders a day on average in the past few weeks, according to the health authorities. The platform said that the company had conducted nucleic acid tests on its entire delivery staff. Delivery men who have had close contact with the infected persons have been barred from receiving orders and are now in quarantine at designated isolation centres, the platform said. Xu Hejian, spokesman for the municipal government, told the media on Monday that Beijing had effectively kept the coronavirus outbreak from spreading and the new local cases were decreasing as the capital uses multiple measures to reduce infections. “Beijing has contained the spread of Covid-19 cases,” Xu said, adding that the epidemic may be showing signs of abating. However, strict measures will remain in place because ending the outbreak remains a complicated task, he said.In the next step, Beijing will continue to implement the strict control and prevention network created in key areas such as restaurants, hospitals and schools. The city also will strengthen food safety controls and increase its nucleic acid testing ability, he said. So far, Beijing has designated four communities as high-risk and 39 as medium-risk for epidemic control. This represents targeted measures to contain the spread of the virus, including locking down communities in high-risk zones. Pang Xinghuo, deputy head of the Beijing Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, re-emphasised the importance of hand-washing and social distancing at Monday’s news conference. As of Saturday, about 2.3 million people in the capital had been tested for the novel coronavirus, the Beijing Health Commission said. By Monday, the overall confirmed cases in China had reached 83,418, including 359 patients who were still being treated, with 13 in severe condition. Altogether 78,425 people had been discharged after recovery and 4,634 people had died of the disease, the NHC said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/food-delivery-man-may-be-beijing-s-coronavirus-new-super-spreader/story-h6rFV2xG9GdChkaTaJH3HN.html

His H-1B visa has expired and he is on extension, which is being granted easily by US authorities in view of the Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns. But if he or his wife were to travel to India or anywhere out of the US, they will be unable to return without getting their passports stamped with renewed visas.That was already a problem with consular operations closed at US missions, and now with the suspension until end of the year, it’s an even worse.“It feels just safer to stay in the US,” Desai said, adding, “things are so uncertain at this time.”Many Indians on H-1B or in line for Green Cards are stranded in India already because of no commercial flights. They have begun to make their way back, slowly.“This is a Hindu Ban much like the Muslim Ban,” said one of those impacted by the suspension, referring to the controversial ban imposed on the entry of people from some Muslim majority countries by Trump early on in his presidency, which remains in force, in a version diluted by legal challenges.This person may have actually meant an “India ban”, not a Hindu ban, because Indians, irrespective of their religion, have been the largest beneficiaries of the suspended H-1Bs and H-4, that are given to spouses of H-1B visa-holders cleared for the Green Card. It allows the spouses to work.Indians are the largest beneficiaries of both H-1Bs (more than 70% of the annual 85,000) and H-4 (for spouses and unmarried children). Indians accounted for 93% of the 126,853 H-4 EAD (employment authorization document) applications approved till December 2017, according to a study by the Congressional Research Service, a non-partisan provider of data and analysis to US congress, based on numbers from the USCIS.This is because the queue for Green Cards is the longest for Indians and the current waiting time is statistically estimated to be over 100 years. H-4 was introduced by President Barack Obama in 2015 as an incentive for these Green Card hopefuls. The Trump administration wants to rescind it.Pramila Jayapal, the Indian American congresswoman who led an joint appeal by lawmakers to the administration to not cancel H-4, slammed Trump’s new order in a post on twitter: “For months, Trump has been desperately trying to do anything to open the country back up and return to ‘normal’. EXCEPT for those who are immigrants seeking to contribute to this country,” she wrote, and added, “We must defeat Trump’s racist and white nationalist agenda.”But for some IT services companies that use H-1Bs to hire workers from India, or elsewhere, the Monday order was “not as bad as feared”.“I breathed a sigh of relief,,” said Deepali Khadakban, owner of New Jersey-based Precision Technologies. Based on news reports and speculation, they had expected a hike in H-1B visa processing fee, which is paid by the employer, a change in the qualification for H-1B, and an end of work authorization for graduates as part of their course.As of now, the suspension will only push the joining date for new hires coming from India, from October, the usual starting time, by a few months to December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/like-us-ban-on-muslims-anger-disquiet-and-some-relief-in-h-1b-circles/story-AFEHRXlELFVLHKNZmL2HZK.html

Indra Nooyi’s H-1B was one of the many stepping stones to the top of Pepsi.Satya Nadella used the visa programme also, but for an entirely different reason. Not to further his career, but his personal life. He gave up his Green Card — yes, he did — and went on H-1B so his wife could join in in the United States. Immigration rules then, as now, make it very difficult for foreigners to join Green Card spouses, without going through a long and uncertain process.So Nadella gave up his permanent residency and switched to H-1B in 1994, a year after he got married and four years after the new visa programme was introduced for high skilled workers in 1990.“What I didn’t expect was the instant notoriety around campus,” Nadella wrote in his 2017 memoir “Hit Refresh, “‘’Hey, there goes the guy who gave up his Green card’.”H-1B can do that to, help married couples unite.But for most people like Pichai and Nooyi, H-1Bs have been a gateway to work, live and prosper in the United States.Pichai came to the US F-1 visa for students; from IIT Kharagpur to Stanford University, California. He went on H-1B visa at McKinsey, and then went on to Google, which he has headed since 2015.Indra Nooyi, who was raised in Chennai and went to the Madras Christian College, went on H-1B visa when she joined the Boston Consulting Group in 1980, according to Business Insider. It was not immediately clear if she was on H-1 at the time, instead. H-1B would be born 10 years later by the Immigration Act of 1990 by splitting H-1 into two — H-1A for nurses and H-1B for “speciality||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/from-sundar-pichai-to-satya-nadella-how-h-1bs-helped-indian-americans-find-work-set-up-family/story-C0Xd70L9z2Z9ktmDtGINpN.html

At the moment we’re still working on ways to make cricket more Covid-secure but we can’t change the guidance yet,” he added in the House of Commons.Clark believes that it is “absurd” that cricket cannot be played when it is one of the more socially-distanced game for players and spectators at most county clubs; many clubs have suffered severe losses due to cricket not being played.The England and Wales County Board has been discussing with the government the resumption of the game at the amateur level, including plans to limit the strength of each side to six or eight instead of 11.Johnson announced easing one of the key lockdown curbs – from 2-metre social distancing to 1-metre – that will allow pubs restaurants, museums, galleries and cinemas to reopen from July 4. The relaxation has been possible after the UK recorded dwindling number of infections in recent days and weeks.He said: “Most leisure facilities and tourist attractions will reopen if they can do so safely, including outdoor gyms and playgrounds, cinemas, museums, galleries, theme parks and arcades as well as libraries, social clubs and community centres”.“’Close proximity’ venues such as nightclubs, soft-play areas, indoor gyms, swimming pools and spas will need to remain closed for now, as will bowling alleys and water parks”, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/resuming-cricket-not-yet-safe-says-uk-pm-boris-johnson/story-10Ljgv49iQ4Poeqtl9QroN.html

The volunteer has asked to remain anonymous.The trial is the first test of a new self-amplifying RNA (saRNA) technology, which has the potential to revolutionise vaccine development and enable scientists to respond more quickly to emerging diseases, the college said, adding that the vaccine has undergone rigorous pre-clinical safety tests and in animal studies it has been shown to be safe and produced encouraging signs of an effective immune response.Katrina Pollock, chief investigator of the study, said: “We have reached a significant milestone in this ground-breaking study with the first dose of a self-amplifying RNA vaccine delivered safely. We are now poised to test the vaccine in the dose evaluation phase before moving forward to evaluating it in larger numbers”.The volunteer will receive second booster dose within four weeks, with several others due to receive their first dose over the coming days. In the initial stage of the trial, 15 healthy volunteers are receiving the vaccine – starting with a low dose and escalating to increasingly higher doses for subsequent volunteers – to assess safety and to find the optimal dosage.Over the coming weeks, 300 healthy participants are expected to receive two doses of the vaccine. If the vaccine is safe and shows a promising immune response in humans, then larger trials would be planned for later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-19-imperial-college-london-s-vaccine-human-trial-begins/story-BihwiBXz7eNWPIkx5jfA1N.html

It has been stable .It has been winning elections. We’ll be stable until 2022.”Madhav also attended a function to felicitate newly-elected Rajya Sabha MP Leishemba Sanajaoba. On Tuesday, Himanta Biswa Sarma,convenor of North-East Democratic Alliance (NEDA) and NPP national chief Sangma left Imphal on a chartered flight to New Delhi.Before their departure, Sarma told reporters that they wanted to bring an amicable solution to end misunderstanding among the lawmakers in the state by resolving all the differences and concentrate on “development and elections.”In another development, a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) team recorded the statement of Congress leader and former Chief Minister O Ibobi Singh in Imphal in connection with its probe into alleged misappropriation of funds when he headed the government, sources said.It is alleged that the former chief minister while he was chairman of Manipur Development Society (MDS) from June 30, 2009 to July 6, 2017, misappropriated the government funds worth Rs 332 crores along with others.Apart from him, others named in the case are former chief secretaries of the state DS Poonia, PC Lawmuknga, O Nabakishore Singh, Y Ningthem, former MDS project director, and S Ranjit Singh, its administrative officer.Ibobi SIngh clarified that his tenure as chairman of MDS was barely one year’s period (July 2013 to August 2014) only.Welcoming the investigation, he said that he was never involved in the transaction activities other than chairing the annual meeting of MDS as the rule authorized its project director for the purpose. “I never signed on any cheques for sanction etc. I will extend my full cooperation in the investigation,” he said.Ibobi Singh had staked claim to for the next government Chief Minister N Biren Singh’s administration plunged into crisis last week after nine MLAs, including four ministers from the NPP withdrew support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ram-madhav-flies-to-imphal-amid-crisis-in-manipur-govt-cbi-questions-former-cm/story-kzocIuK8jhsfhGKCdTJUtO.html

The suggestion came even as the R C Kuhad panel set up to look into the issues related to examinations and the academic calendar in view of the pandemic has recommended that the exams be cancelled. The panel has suggested that the students be allotted marks according to an appropriate “averaging” formula.“I have advised the @ugc_india to revisit the guidelines issued earlier for intermediate and Terminal Semester examinations and academic calendar. The foundation for revisited guidelines shall be health and safety students, teachers and staff,” Nishank tweeted.UGC officials said a final decision on the cancellation of exams is yet to be taken. Officials said they will have to come up with alternative criteria for allotting marks and grades if the exams are cancelled. There is a possibility that a group of students may feel that the criteria chosen are disadvantageous to them, they added.UGC, the higher education regulator, in April issued the guidelines on the basis of the panel’s report on the next academic session. As per the guidelines, fresh admissions were to be completed in August and classes were scheduled to begin in September. The guidelines allowed universities to choose their modes of examinations.Students and teachers, including those from the Delhi University, opposed the guidelines. The Delhi University Teachers Association urged vice-chancellor Yogesh Tyagi to cancel the open book exams the university plans to conduct. Nishank’s tweet came a day after the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that deliberations for cancelling remaining Class 10 and 12 board exams are at an advanced stage and a final decision in this regard was likely to get finalised by Wednesday. The court last week asked CBSE, which is scheduled to conduct the exams from July 1 to 15, to consider scrapping the exams in response to a plea from a group of parents.Officials said the ministry feels conducting exams is not very conducive given the rising number of Covid-19 cases.Several state governments have expressed concerns about holding board exams. The Maharashtra government on Wednesday told the Bombay High Court that the Indian School Certificate Examination board cannot be permitted to conduct its pending exams in July.CBSE will inform the Supreme Court about its decision on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nishank-asks-ugc-to-revisit-exam-guidelines/story-2oOUIGN2FoB7xxXc81qmlI.html

According to a circular sent by the Archbishop of Goa, each priest in charge of a church will have to write seeking special permission to restart services after he is satisfied that he is able to meet with the requirements of the SOPs issued by the Central Government as well as guidelines issued by church authorities. “The Priest responsible for the place of worship, after careful and deliberate preparation, considers that he is able to meet with the requirements of the SOPs, the Diocesan Authority will send his delegate for an on-site inspection and will grant the requested permission only if he is satisfied that the church or chapel shrine can in fact comply with all the requirements,” the Archbishop of Goa and Daman, Filipe Neri Ferrao said in a circular sent to all priests. “The places of worship should not be opened before this permission is granted in writing. The time required to comply with the safety protocols may vary from place to place,” he said. Among the requirements that churches will be mandated to put in place before they can apply for permission include arrangements to ensure that people sit at least six feet apart, the place is well ventilated, as well as contactless thermometers, sanitizer dispensers, signages, etc. Under Unlock 1 announced by the Centre, places of worship were allowed to open from June 8. The Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare had issued Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for places of worship to contain the spread of Covid-19. However, church authorities in Goa chose to defer the opening after a critical evaluation of the situation that arose due to the sudden surge of Covid-19 cases.Among the guidelines issued, persons above 65 years of age, people with comorbidities and pregnant women and children below 10 years of age, those with symptoms, those having family members under quarantine will not be allowed to participate in services.“All of us need to realize the seriousness of the present situation and proceed with prudence and discernment, exercising responsibility for our own safety and that of others. Ultimately, however, it will be the personal responsibility of each individual faithful to decide if and when he/she should attend the religious services in the current situation,” the Archbishop said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-covid-19-cases-rise-in-goa-churches-in-no-hurry-to-resume-services/story-ULIYGW1tsV0LMOpZ1QprGN.html

After the post triggered outrage the activist said both were her children and it was a work of art.The case was filed after a woman BJP leader in Kottayam filed a complaint saying these posts come under child pornography and provisions of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO). Police in Pathanamthitta booked her under Section 67 of the IT Act (electronically transmitting sexually explicit material) and Section 75 of the Juvenile Justice Act. They said they will also examine whether provisions of POCSO can be applied in the case.Initially Fathima had posted the video clip on Facebook and later she uploaded it on YouTube. She justified her act saying her kids did the painting while she was resting and it was a beautiful art work. “Just as beauty is in the eyes of the beholder, so is porn in the eyes of the beholder,” she wrote in the post.Fathima, who was working as a junior technician with BSNL in Ernakulam, was dismissed from the service two months ago after a string of complaints. Last year she was arrested on a complaint filed by a rightwing activist claiming she hurt religious feelings of the Hindu community by posting an objectionable picture on social media. She was in jail for two months.In October 2018, she sparked outrage by attempting to trek to Sabarimala temple along with a Hyderabad-based woman digital journalist. She was excommunicated by the Muslim Jamaath Council and her house was later vandalised by protestors as the news spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-activist-booked-for-posting-video-of-kids-painting-on-her-body/story-UxVdYFThSafLexepvVtIsN.html

24-06-2020||India||Kerala scraps demand for Covid-free certificate for expats returning home||The Kerala government on Wednesday scrapped its demand for Covid-free certificates for expatriates returning home from West Asian countries after the Centre said tests are not feasible in Indian missions but insisted that passengers will have to wear personal protection equipment (PPE) during the flights.For two weeks, the state government had crossed swords with the Centre over Covid-free certificates for expatriates even as the number of people from Kerala dying in Persian Gulf countries crossed 300. Despite a massive outrage after it made Covid-free certificates mandatory, the Kerala government stood its ground. The state government finally relented after the Centre made it clear that evacuation will be difficult if it puts such “unreasonable conditions”.But Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan maintained that the state’s position was consistent and it took such a decision to avert a “super spreading” of Covid-19. The government has now made personal protection equipment (PPE) mandatory for returning expatriates but many medical experts said in long-duration flights full PPE kits will pose many problems.“It will be difficult in long-duration flights. Once passengers wear them, they won’t be able to go to washrooms. We hope someone will inform them about this,” said Indian Medical Association Kerala chapter president Abraham Verghese.The CM said there was a concerted move to array expatriates against the government “but they will realise these follies”. A Malayalam newspaper ‘Madhyamam’ on Wednesday carried photos of more than 300 people who died in the Persian Gulf countries with a banner headline asking“ How many more will have to die for the government to open its eyes?” The CM said this was a well-planned and calculated move to turn expatriates against the government.“We never blocked any flights. We took such a decision to check super spreaders and community spreading. More than 90 per cent of the cases in the state are people who came from abroad or other states. We insisted for certificates because of this,” he said. The Congress-led opposition criticised the government move saying it was more interested in its records, not welfare of stranded people.At least 18 lakh people from the state are working in Gulf countries and out of which four lakh have registered to return on a government website which began after lockdown norms were eased. As on Tuesday 88,000 expatriates have returned in ‘Vandhe Bharat’ and chartered flights. At least 149 Vande Bharat and 171 chartered flights are being planned in the next two weeks.Meanwhile, the state reported more than 100 cases for the sixth consecutive day on Wednesday with 152 fresh cases. Kerala’s Covid-19 tally now stands at 3,603. Out of these, 1,888 people have recovered while 1,692 are active cases. The Covid-19 death toll in Kerala is 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-scraps-demand-for-covid-free-certificate-for-expats-returning-home/story-iwRr1sQeLwiQKzdJPPhWYM.html

The station has been dedicated to transgender community in an attempt to empower it with respect and to trigger a change in how it is perceived by other sections of the society, said officials.“NMRC had received a number of suggestions from individuals and NGOs regarding a suitable name for the station which would correctly signify and represent the essence of this community. Keeping these suggestions in mind, NMRC has decided to name the station as ‘Rainbow’ station,” an official NMRC release signed by its managing director Ritu Maheshwari said. Noida sector 50 netro station is on the Aqua line that connects the twin cities of Noida and Greater Noida. For Coronavirus Live UpdatesMaheshwari had earlier this month announced the intention to name the station after the trangender community stating that it would give them a chance to connect with the mainstream. She had clarified that the dedication to the community didn’t mean that the station was being reserved solely for their use. It will be open for use by the general public, she had clarified.NMRC also proposes to provide employment to the members from the transgender community.“This initiative has been taken to uplift and provide employment to the transgender community. Under this initiative, they will be employed for some activities such as ticketing counter and housekeeping,” Maheshwari had said on June 22.Also Read: Noida Police clocks second-best response time to distress calls in UPSector-50 metro station will be upgraded to include toilet facilities and some other features to reflect its special status.

But the talks remained inconclusive due to a disagreement over the number of bus services to be operated,” a senior official of the TSRTC familiar with the development said.The inter-state bus services were suspended in the last week of March following the imposition of nationwide lockdown to contain the spread of Covid-19.Though the inter-state travel restrictions were lifted by Telangana in the first week of June, Andhra Pradesh is yet to open up its borders for Telangana and is allowing private travellers into the state only after conducting tests on the inter-state borders. The RTC bus services are being operated within the states, but the inter-state services have not yet been restored.The RTC official said before the bifurcation of the combined Andhra Pradesh state in June 2014, most of the buses were being operated from the depots in Andhra and Rayalaseema regions to Telangana.“While nearly 2,500-3,000 RTC buses were being operated from Vijayawada, Guntur, Visakhapatnam, Rajahmundry, Kurnool and Anantapur to Hyderabad and a few other important cities in Telangana, less than 1,000 buses used to be operated from Telangana depots to Andhra and Rayalaseema,” he said.The trend continued in the post-bifurcation period as well, as the APSRTC started making profits by continuing to run more buses to Telangana, while TSRTC ended up in losses. While APSRTC buses had been running for more than 3 lakh kilometres a day in Telangana till recently, the TSRTC buses had not operated even up to 1.50 lakh kilometres in AP.“That is precisely why the TSRTC authorities are insisting on a level-playing field in the post-lockdown period. If APSRTC runs 100 buses in Telangana, the TSRTC also should be allowed to run the same number in Andhra, so that they can earn equal revenue. That is the main reason for deadlock in talks,” the Telangana RTC official said.The talks are likely to resume in the first week of July, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-telangana-in-tussle-over-restoration-of-inter-state-bus-services/story-jt4lsMy4oqBQDFY6pOFTsK.html

The state capital Bengaluru has 1,170 of the 3,799 active cases in the state.Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases, home minister Basvaraj Bommai said that Chief Minister BS Yediyurappa will discuss with experts and take a call shortly on whether a city or statewide lockdown should again be imposed to contain the spread of the disease.“The CM is discussing both with senior administration officials and medical experts on whether and when a lockdown needs to be imposed. But we will have to consider the economic costs of such a move too,” Bommai said.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage.On Tuesday JD (S) leader and former CM H D Kumaraswamy had demanded that the government impose a 20-day lockdown across the state to prevent the rapid spread of the virus.On Wednesday, Kumaraswamy took to Twitter and directly appealed to the people of the state to impose a self-declared curfew and stay at home asserting that the economy was not more important than life.Accusing the state government of complete failure in preventing the spread of the virus as well as treating those infected, he said that the medical services were fully stretched to treat even the 3,000-4,000 active cases and claimed that there was a shortage of hospital beds and ventilators.He said that even after the government capped prices of treatment at private hospitals it was unaffordable for the vast majority of the population.Meanwhile, health and family welfare minister B Sriramulu said workers, traders and people across 15 different categories need to be tested to check whether community transmission has set in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/b-s-yediyurappa-to-decide-on-fresh-lockdown-as-karnataka-s-covid-19-tally-crosses-10k/story-0PU3nfCw60OiDNmiEGJ2uI.html

The high court admitted the petition for hearing.The former SEC alleged that the state government had wilfully and deliberately violated the May 29 directions of the high court. He contended that since the Supreme Court had refused to stay the high court order, it would automatically be construed that he would continue as the SEC.“In total disobedience of the high court order, I am not being permitted to be restored to my earlier position as SEC and discharge the duties, as the election notification (for local bodies) continues to be in force,” he said in his petition.He further said Justice Kanagaraju, retired Madras high court judge, who was appointed in his place in April, was still being treated as the SEC.Making the government chief secretary, panchayat raj department secretary and SEC secretary the respondents, Ramesh Kumar appealed to the court to punish them under Sections 10 and 12 of the Contempt of Courts Act.It may be recalled that the Jagan government had removed Ramesh Kumar from the post of SEC on April 10 by promulgating an ordinance seeking to amend AP Panchayat Raj Act, after the latter postponed the local body elections stating Covid-19 as the reason.Subsequently, Ramesh Kumar challenged the ordinance in the high court, which was struck down on May 29. The Jagan government moved the Supreme Court, seeking a stay on high court order, but the SC did not grant the same while posting the case to a later date for further hearing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jagan-govt-delays-ex-andhra-poll-officer-s-reappointment-he-moves-court/story-L1kGuzPQihRROS9vhQ0FYM.html

The Prime Minister had announced that an amount of Rs 50,000 crore would be spent for building durable rural infrastructure under the Abhiyaan.A review meeting for the programme was held by the railway board chairman with all zonal officers and railway PSUs on Wednesday. Railways will appoint nodal officers in all the 116 districts and at the state level, the ministry said.“Zonal railways have been instructed to expedite execution of all ongoing infrastructure works in these identified districts. Around 160 infrastructure works have been identified which are to be expedited. These would engage thousands of workers and roughly generate eight lakh man-days of employment by the end of October. Approximately, Rs 1,800 crore would be spent in these districts,” the ministry said.A number of railway works have also been identified which can be executed through the MGNREGS, the ministry said. Hindustan Times on June 12 had reported the ministry of railways is considering generating employment under the government’s flagship rural job guarantee scheme, a move aimed at helping migrants who have returned home in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic and the lockdown imposed to slow its spread. At present, the national carrier mostly employs skilled labourers though private contractors for its construction work.“The works are related to construction and maintenance of approach roads for level crossings, development and cleaning of silted waterways, trenches and drains along the track, construction and maintenance of approach road to railway stations, repair and widening of existing railway embankments/ cuttings, plantation of trees at extreme boundary of railway land and protection works of existing embankments/cuttings/bridges,” the ministry said.Zonal Railways have also been instructed to get sanction for proposed works under the MGNREGS. The ministry’s move comes even as the Centre and the states have begun the process of undertaking a comprehensive skill mapping exercise of migrant workers as part of an attempt to find them work closer home.“The Abhiyaan will be a convergent effort between various ministries/departments of Government Of India to expedite implementation of various public infrastructure works and works relating to augmentation of livelihood opportunities,” the ministry added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-lakh-man-days-of-employment-for-migrants-over-125-days-says-railways/story-t2yrHTxZeYIsw9qZIyZ8WL.html

We actors were desperately waiting for the shoot to resume; in fact each one of us, be it the technicians or other crew members, wanted work to resume. Though it came with guidelines and rules, still it is a big reason to be cheerful in these gloomy times.”Reem began her career as a child artiste. “I was six when I did my first show‘Neer Bhare Tere Naina Devi’. It was then I faced the camera for the first time, so you can say I have learnt acting on sets with real teachers. Then I did a number of shows including, ‘Na Aana Is Des Laado,’‘Me Aajji Aur Sahib,’ ‘Diya Aur Baat Hum,’ and many more till I got a role in the movie ‘Wazir’ which was with biggies like Amitabh (Bachchan) sir and Farhan Akhtar. It was really a learning experience for a beginner like me. So you can say that’s how I have learnt the craft of acting,” she said during her online interaction.Sharing her experience of playing the Pakistani teenager, girl-education activist and Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala Yousafzai, she says, “It was a beautiful yet a challenging character to play. The confidence the makers had in me made me give my best to the project. Playing someone whose journey has been so inspiring for thousands of people was never an easy job but deep understanding of the character did help me a lot. The film was wholeheartedly accepted everywhere in the world. I am glad to get such a great debut in the beginning of my film career.”At present Reem is busy with her ongoing show where she plays a central role. “We started ‘Tujhse Hai Raabta’ back in 2016 and we were moving ahead with the plot when the Covid crisis happened and all the work was stopped. Thankfully, we are back on the sets to take the show ahead. Soon lockdown episodes will be aired which we actors shot at our homes and then new episodes will begin.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/happy-to-be-back-on-sets-reem-sheikh/story-2KNJR9UpMVocEydiIe3pWN.html

24-06-2020||India||Plea in SC seeks probe into Congress-China MoU of 2008||The memorandum of understanding (MoU) entered into between the Congress party and the Communist Party of China in 2008 raises concerns regarding national security and should be investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) for offences under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) or the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), a petition filed before the Supreme Court on Wednesday prayed.The petitioners, Shahshak Shekhar Jha, a Delhi based advocate and Savio Rodrigues, the editor of Goa based online news portal, Goa Chronicle alleged that despite India having ‘hostile’ relations with China, the Congress party had signed the MoU when it was leading a coalition government at the centre and it also failed to disclose the facts and details of the agreement to the public.“Petitioner No. 2 (Savio Rodrigues) had demanded the respondents to make the said MoU public, however, no heed was shown in that respect which shows the malafide intention of the Respondents (Congress party and its leaders)”, the petition stated.Both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have also been made party to the case apart from the Congress party.“Issue an order directing NIA to investigate the said agreement under UAPA”, it was prayed by the petitioners.The UAPA is a law aimed at punishing those involved in terrorist activities and activities intended to bring about secession of any part of the country from the union of India.In the alternative, Jha and Rodrigues sought a court-monitored probe by CBI. After the recent faceoff between Indian and Chinese armies at Ladakh, the Congress party has stepped up its attack on the Narendra Modi government alleging it failed on diplomatic and military fronts.The ruling BJP, on the other hand, countered by referring to the MoU signed by Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on behalf of the Congress party with the Chinese Communist Party. The MoU was signed at Beijing in the presence of Sonia Gandhi who was then the chairperson of the United Progressive Alliance (UPA) headed by the Congress.Placing reliance on media reports, the petitioners submitted that at least 600 incursions happened from Chinese side into Indian territory between 2008 and 2013. “The Congress party brought the Right to Information Act during its rule, yet it failed to be transparent in this matter which is of national importance”, the petition said.Jha had earlier approached the top court seeking CBI probe into the lynching of Hindu seers in Palghar district of Maharashtra. The court, on May 1, sought a status report from Maharashtra government regarding the same. That case is expected to be heard again in the second week of July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/plea-in-sc-seeks-probe-into-congress-china-mou-of-2008/story-5YQJca6V2RLep7siiSJGQK.html
24-06-2020||India||SC dismisses review petitions challenging 2018 verdict on adultery||The Supreme Court has held that its historic decision stubbing out the 158-year old archaic law on adultery from the criminal statute book does not require any reconsideration. The decision passed by the Court nearly 20 months ago was challenged in two review petitions. A five-judge Constitution bench heard the matter in chambers and dismissed the same last month. The order passed on May 28 was recently uploaded on the Supreme Court website.An organization called All Religious Affinity Movement and an individual Ravi Kumar filed separate review pleas seeking recall of the Court’s verdict as it was against the concept of family. A bench of Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, Justices RF Nariman, AM Khanwilkar, DY Chandrachud and Indu Malhotra said, “We have carefully gone through the Review Petitions and the connected papers filed therewith. We do not find any ground, whatsoever, to entertain the same. The Review Petitions are, accordingly, dismissed.”It was on September 27, 2018 the apex court took a bold decision to scrap Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code that punished adultery. This provision was treated as a relic of the Victorian era as it allowed a husband to prosecute any man who engaged in a consensual sexual relationship with his wife.The law was challenged by Joseph Shine, an Indian settled abroad, who found it to be archaic, discriminatory and arbitrary. He wondered that if the purpose of the law is to protect the sanctity of family and marriage, the choice should be given to both husband and wife to prosecute their cheating spouse. On the contrary, the provision allowed only the husband to lodge a case of adultery against the other man in his wife’s life. Further, Shine pointed out that provision worked on the concept of husband’s consent. If a husband consents to his wife having sex with a stranger, regardless of the woman’s consent, no case under this section will be made out.Speaking to HT after the rejection of the review petitions, advocate Kaleeswaram Raj who had argued for Joseph Shine in the Supreme Court, said, “The dismissal of the review petitions is a big boost for the libertarian movement of individual rights across the world. This judgment fenced the State from interfering in individual behaviour that was not criminal in nature.” The then CJI Dipak Misra had said that adultery at best could be a civil or moral wrong that could be a ground to seek divorce. Treating it as an offence would tantamount to the State entering into a private realm, he had said.Except for former CJI Dipak Misra who has since retired, the remaining four judges who delivered the landmark ruling were part of the bench that heard the review petitions.Adultery has ceased to be a crime in China, Japan, Brazil, New Zealand, Australia, Scotland, the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Germany, Austria, the Republic of Ireland, Barbados, Bermuda, Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, and Seychelles. It continues to be a crime in countries such as Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Iran, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Philippines, United Arab Emirates, some states of the United States of America, Algeria, Democratic Republic of Congo, Egypt, Morocco, and some parts of Nigeria.The five-judge bench was unanimous in its view that the 158-year old law does not square with the Constitutional law of the present times. It was also seen to deprive a woman of her dignity, sexual autonomy as the law treated her to be a property of her husband.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-dismisses-review-petitions-challenging-2018-verdict-on-adultery/story-YVUQcqGfDXP8wZMxrHr0XI.html

Divya Pharmacy has been asked to reply within seven days.Confirming the development, Dr YS Rawat, joint director state licensing authority (Ayush), said: “We didn’t issue any license to them for COVID medicine. They had applied for license for immunity booster kits made from herb extracts from medicinal plants like Giloi, Ashwagandha and Tulsi.”Rawat added that Divya Pharmacy, promoted by Ramdev’s Patanjali Ayurved has been given a week’s time to respond and a failure to submit a satisfactory reply will lead to cancellation of the license.“We have now issued a notice to Divya Pharmacy seeking its explanation within seven days over the claims made regarding finding COVID-19 cure. If we do not get a satisfactory response from them, then their license will be cancelled,” Dr YS Rawat said.Anand Swaroop, director of directorate of Ayurved and Unani services in the state, said the authorities were checking if Patanjali’s claims are in violation of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 and Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954.Also Read: Complaint filed in Bihar court against Baba Ramdev over Covid-19 medicine claimThe AYUSH ministry, in a statement on Tuesday, asked the licensing authority of the Uttarakhand government to provide copies of the license and product approval details of the Ayurvedic medicines being claimed for the treatment of Covid-19.Dilip Jawalkar, secretary AYUSH department Uttarakhand said that the state government has sent all the relevant documents regarding issuing of license to Patanjali to the Central government for verification.“We have sent all the relevant documents related to the license issued to Patanjali, as asked by the ministry of AYUSH, for verification. We are waiting to hear from the ministry, after which, we will take a decision on further action in the matter,” said Jawalkar.According to AYUSH guidelines, AYUSH registered practitioner/expert should be part of the traditional medicine study/research team at each site and the research should be conducted in line with ministry or ICMR guidelines for clinical research.The research must also comply with relevant regulations for bio-medical and health research and good clinical practice and national ethical guidelines. Among other conditions, the proposal/research should be approved by their scientific advisory bodies and institutional ethics committee.On Tuesday, Baba Ramdev had launched “Coronil” and “Swasari” as a cure for Covid-19, stressing that they “conducted a clinical case study and clinical controlled trial, and found that 69 percent patients recovered in three days and 100 % patients recovered in seven days” on administration of the two Ayurvedic products mentioned above.Following these claims, the union AYUSH ministry demanded a clarification from Patanjali Ayurved and instructed it to stop advertising the product till the claim is verified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-govt-issues-notice-to-patanjali-s-divya-pharmacy-over-covid-19-medicine/story-B6j599c7tUkS7yNM7j2RYP.html
24-06-2020||India||India notifies 24.04 lakh Tuberculosis cases, 79,144 deaths in 2019, says report||India notified the highest number of 24.04 lakh tuberculosis cases last year as against an estimated 26.9 lakh cases by WHO, indicating that around three lakh patients missed out from the national TB programme, according to an annual report on the disease released on Wednesday.The India TB Report 2020 stated that 79,144 deaths due to tuberculosis were reported in 2019, which is much lower than the WHO estimate of 4.4 lakh fatalities, officials said.According to them, the “missing cases” -- the gap between estimated incidences and notified cases -- has drastically reduced from over 10 lakh in 2017 to 2.9 lakh in 2019 through greater engagement with private healthcare sector along with other initiatives.Around 24.04 lakh TB patients were notified in 2019, registering 14 per cent increase over the previous year while the private sector saw an increase of around 35 per cent with 6.78 lakh tuberculosis patients notified, officials said.Launching the annual report, Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan commended the collective efforts of all involved in the task, and said the government was committed to eliminating tuberculosis from the country by 2025, five years ahead of the global target. To align with the ambitious goal, the programme has been renamed from Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) to National Tuberculosis Elimination Programme (NTEP), he said.On the basis of the score in State TB Index, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh were the top three best-performing states for tuberculosis control under the category of states with 50 lakh population.Tripura and Nagaland were best-performing in the category of states having less than 50 lakh population. Dadra and Nagar Haveli, and Daman and Diu were selected as the best performing Union Territories.“The ranking will surely encourage all states and UTs to improve their performance to attain their targets. Early accurate diagnosis followed by prompt appropriate treatment is vital for ending TB. The National TB Elimination Programme has expanded both the laboratory network as well as diagnostic facilities to cover the entire country,” Vardhan said.About the stigma attached to TB patients in the country, which is hampering the fight against the disease, Vardhan said, “We as a nation, need to come together to fight tuberculosis and the stigma surrounding it so that every TB patient can seek care with dignity and without discrimination. The community must act as a wellspring of support and comfort for a patient.” He underscored the crucial contribution the private sector can make to the national TB programme by mandatory tuberculosis notification and providing quality care.The salient feature of this year is that for the first time Central TB Division (CTD) introduced a quarterly ranking on TB elimination efforts by all the states and UTs. Treatment linkage of drug-resistant TB patients, HIV testing of tuberculosis patients, nutritional assistance to in the form of NIKSHAY Poshan Yojana (DBT), Universal Drug Susceptibility Testing (UDST) coverage among notified patients, TB Preventive Therapy (TPT) coverage and financial expenditure are included in the assessment criteria, the Union health minister said.According to the report, similar to the previous year’s trends over half of the total TB cases were notified from five states -- Uttar Pradesh 20 per cent, Maharashtra nine per cent, Madhya Pradesh eight per cent, Rajasthan and Bihar both seven per cent. Due to easy availability of molecular diagnostics, the proportion of children diagnosed with TB increased to eight per cent in 2019 compared to six per cent in 2018, the ministry said in a statement.Also, the provision of HIV testing for all notified TB patients increased from 67 per cent in 2018 to 81 per cent in 2019, it said.Expansion of treatment services has resulted in a 12 per cent improvement in the treatment success rate of notified patients. For 2019, it is 81 per cent compared to 69 per cent the previous year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-notifies-24-04-lakh-tuberculosis-cases-79-144-deaths-in-2019-says-report/story-O3XBHO2AtaZLRmrgFdbjtM.html

The stand-off escalated into a violent face-off at one of the four locations earlier this month, leading to a spike in tension between the two countries.“The two delegations agreed that implementation of this understanding expeditiously, in accordance with the bilateral agreements and protocols, would help ensure peace and tranquillity in border areas and the development of broader relationship between the two countries,” a statement issued after the meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs (WMCC) said.Also Read: India deploys specialised mountain forces to check China’s LAC transgressionsThe two sides also agreed to maintain communication both at diplomatic and military level including under the framework of WMCC to resolve the existing situation peacefully.The WMCC dialogue, held via video conference, continued for more than four hours, people familiar with the development told Hindustan Times.Also Watch l ‘Need to respect international law..’: Jaishankar in a meet with China, Russia Both sides started from the very basis of the boundary differences with treaties and maps to back them.

Ironically, neither the farmer nor the bank knew about the alleged fraudulent transactions, an official said.The farmer and the bank came to know about the fraud when the farmer approached the bank for the entry of transactions into his passbook, officials said.Fifty-seven-year-old Gursharan Singh, a farmer living in Pratappur village under police station Khatima in US Nagar has a saving account in the Oriental Bank of Commerce (OBC) since 2003.“Since I have accounts in other banks also, I hardly operated the OBC account,” Singh said.Also read: Uttarakhand govt to start two English medium schools in every block“I had gone to the bank on June 18 for the entry of transactions into my passbook.

Over 4 to 5 transactions of Rs 7,900 each were made by me.

Name one election where people had not come and gone. This is election season and the government is trying to keep their governance safe...A few days back JD(U) MLC had come to us, so these things go on,” Tejashwi Yadav was quoted as saying by ANI.Tejashwi, however, didn’t forget to take a dig at chief minister Nitish Kumar suggesting his party had a hand in the defections. “Best wishes to those who left. Nitish ji has done constructive work but that constructive work can benefit only him. Yesterday’s incident can bring him personal benefit but nothing to the people of Bihar,” he added.Also Read: Sushil Modi requests Amit Shah for extension of free food grain scheme for poorTejashwi’s mixed comments come a day after his party colleague and RJD state president Jagdanand Singh declared a ‘virtual war’ against JD(U) and warned Nitish Kumar of a “befitting reply” to defections . “Nitish Kumar has lured legislators through money. The war has started. He will get a befitting reply,” Singh had said.Radha Charan Shah, Sanjay Prasad, Dilip Rai, Md Kamar Alam and Ranvijay Kumar Singh defected to JD(U) yesterday without inviting the anti-defection law by virtue of their numbers—more than two-third of the total number of RJD MLC party.The RJD is now reduced to only three MLCs in the council, while the JD(U)’s strength has increased to 21 MLCs in the 75-member council. The council’s present strength is 46 since 29 seats are vacant. The BJP has 16 MLCs in the council and also has the support of an independent MLC.RJD on Wednesday announced the names of three candidates for the legislative council polls.

Banbasa, a town located at the India-Nepal border is about 330 kilometres away from Dehradun and is an entry point for those going to Nepal from Champawat after crossing the bridge over Sharda river.There are about 550 traders in Banbasa who have traditional trade relations with their counterparts in Kanchanpur, Nepal across the border. After the tensions in India-Nepal relations, Indian traders are majorly concerned about their business which largely depends on their customers from Nepal. “We have trade relations for years and almost 80 percent of our business depends on our customers from Nepal while the remaining 20 percent on the local market. First, the lockdown affected it and now the tensions between the two countries,” said Shankar Lal Verma, a Banbasa based trader and state secretary of Uttarakhand Vyapar Mandal, a state-based traders body. Also read: China could set up border outposts in encroached territories - Nepal govt documentVerma said the “unfortunate developments have already affected their trade as it has come down drastically.” “The traders from Nepal used to buy our vegetables, ration items, hardware, cloth and cosmetics. But now, the business is almost over as not even 5 percent is left. For many traders, their entire business depends on trade with Nepal,” said Verma adding, “many traders who are staying here on rent and doing their business in rented shops are planning to leave the town due to losses.”Another local trader Sanjay Agrawal, who is also the vice-president of the local trade body, said, “Not only losses, but many traders are also worried about the huge payment which is due to be paid by the Nepalese trade partners”.“Payment of at least Rs 1 crore is due which is to be paid by the Nepalese traders for the goods they purchased from us. Now, whenever we ask them for the payment over the phone, they are dilly-dallying and asking us to first send more goods after which they will release the payment. We are now stuck and helpless,” said Agrawal. Also read: Nepal’s FM radio stations beam propaganda across border, say Lipulekh theirsHe added, “A few days ago, representatives of the traders’ body wrote to the district administration to allow a group of traders to cross the border and take their payments but we are yet to get any reply”.Expressing concern over the prevailing situation, a local social activist Vinod Kala said, “If the situation prevails, it would prove disastrous for the traders as their businesses will be destroyed. Their livelihood would be endangered in this crisis”.However, if the Nepalese traders are to be believed, there is not much effect on their businesses because of the prevailing situations. Madhav Prasad Joshi, a trader in Kanchanpur town of Nepal near Banbasa, and member of Sudur Paschim Pradesh Vyapar Mandal, Nepal, said, “The business is hardly affected on the Nepalese side as compared to the Indian side. 90 percent of the customers are Nepalese and only 10 percent are Indian.”“In our trade relations, it was majorly the Nepalese people who used to visit Banbasa town to buy things and not the other way round. That’s why we are not much affected. Also, only people have been stopped from visiting the two places while trucks carrying goods from there are coming here after passing through customs. This has maintained our supply with no issues as such,” said Joshi. On the concerns of payment due with the Nepalese traders, Joshi said, “All payment will be made to the Indian traders with no fraud at all”.“I want to assure our Indian partners that their money will be paid if the trade was legal. If the payment was of any illegal trade, then we can’t give any assurance on that. Else, we will make sure the payment is made under proper norms and regulations,” he said. Joshi, however, affirmed that the ongoing tension between India and Nepal will “hardly affect the people-to-people relations between the sides”.“It is completely a political issue and will not affect our friendly relations. We believe that the two governments will soon resolve it politically and our relations will be intact like before,” said Joshi. Meanwhile, the Uttarakhand government said that they are aware of the issues faced by the traders of Banbasa but the solution would be brought at the ‘international level.’||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uncertainty-looms-over-cross-border-trade-amid-india-nepal-tension-traders-say-80-of-business-under-threat/story-c1RnEoBw5EVMkeVkNY82LI.html

Her body was burnt in a forest in neighbouring Raigad district. Former media baron Peter Mukerjea was later arrested for allegedly being part of the conspiracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sheena-bora-murder-indrani-mukerjea-seeks-bail-citing-coronavirus-scare/story-CuuWJk1oSxv4wYR8obX5CL.html

Sai cited various statements the MP has made against the programmes taken up by the party and the state government.Citing one example, Reddy said the MP had criticised the Jagan Reddy government’s decision to introduce English medium in the government schools and formation of three capitals for decentralisation of administration.“You have also alleged that the YSRCP MLAs were resorting to looting of sand in the state without any corroborating evidence. You have remarked that you do not owe your electoral victory to party or chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy and that you would have won elections from any other party,” he said.“Your comments against the party leadership were not only derogatory but also indicated your resolve to move away from the party. They also provide irrefutable evidence that you have voluntarily given up the membership of the party,” the show-cause notice said.It may be mentioned that last week, the Narasapuram MP wrote a letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla requesting that he be provided additional armed security from central police forces in the wake of threat to his life from his own party MLAs and leaders in his constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ysr-congress-party-mp-asked-to-explain-comments-against-party-leadership/story-3fOm8wcsyM8nmNGmjbSxBI.html

He called a friend to the Kolkata airport and asked him to take his son to his elder brother’ house in the city’s north.In the evening, Agarwal went to his in-laws place and shot his 65-year-old mother-in-law Lalita Dhandania before turning the gun on himself. His father-in-law Subhash Dhandania, 70, managed to rush out of the flat to save his life.“The 67-page suicide note, of which 66 pages are typed, was titled ‘Mahabharat of my life’,” said a senior official of the Kolkata Police’s detective department.Investigators have come to know from the note that Agarwal, used to stay in a separate flat in Bengaluru, as a divorce suit was going on over the past two years. From Bengaluru he had had gone to Bihar to explore the option of hiring a contract killer and to Tamil Nadu to look for snakes before the lockdown started.“In the suicide note he has mentioned how he had explored various options from snake bites to car accident to kill his wife. He had even thought of contracting a supari killer. But later he thought of doing the job himself as he could not trust anyone,” said a police officer.“From whatever we have gathered so far, Agarwal seems to have planned the murder more than six months back. We think he had purchased the pistol during his earlier visit to Kolkata. He had come to Kolkata at least thrice this year before the lockdown,” said a senior officer.Police have come to know that after taking a cab from the airport he got down at a place, which was around 500m from his in-laws’ place.“He had a second flat very close to his in-laws. After getting down from the cab he first went to that flat before walking up to his in-laws’ flat. So it seems that he might have purchased the weapon during oen of his earlier visits and hid it in his flat,” said a senior official.Police suspect that Agarwal had plans to kill all his in-laws including his father-in-law and brother-in-law. He had even called his brother-in-law Vineet Dhandania, who stays in Gurugram, to come down to Kolkata. Vineet, however, failed to turn up.“Bengaluru police have already found Shilpi’s body from her flat. She was probably strangulated. There were signs of scuffle in the Mahadevapura flat. Preliminary investigation suggests that Agarwal first kept his ten-year-old son in the apartment’s guest room and went up to his wife’s flat. When his wife opened the door he forced his way and killed her. Later he spent the night in the guest room.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/snake-bite-contract-killer-car-accident-options-amit-agarwal-explored-to-kill-wife/story-cPEeWYLHOE3WguqSodGHIP.html

24-06-2020||India||Government opens up space sector and assets to private sector to ‘enhance’ capacity||The Central government has approved the opening of the key space sector for private participation in a cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday. The government said the move will free up India’s premier space agency Isro (Indian Space Research Organisation) to focus on research and development while providing opportunities to expand India’s space exploration and technology through private participation.These reforms can be compared to the reforms in the power sector carried out during the rule of Atal Bihari Vajpayee government, Union minister Javadekar said at the cabinet press briefing in New Delhi.“We have built up really good space assets, these assets are now opening up for everyone’s use,” Javadekar said. He recalled that a group of Indian students, who had developed a satellite indigenously, had to launch from a facility outside India due to regulatory limitations. He said, such a situation won’t arrive in the future with the new reforms in the space sector.Space minister Jitendra Singh said a new organization named Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (In-SPACe) has been floated to guide private enterprise participation in space activities and the use of country’s space infrastructure.“Newly created Indian National Space Promotion and Authorization Centre (IN-SPACe) to provide a level playing field for private companies to use Indian space infrastructure. It will also hand-hold, promote and guide the private industries in space activities,” said Singh.He called it a “historic decision” and a departure from the past practice since Independence. He credited Prime Minister Narendra Modi for piloting the “far-sighted” reform.“PM Modi is known for taking decisions that are bold, unorthodox, and futuristic; which is whythe decision for hosting the private sector participation in space sector activities has been taken. There was a history and tradition of keeping the space activities shrouded under secrecy,” Singh said, explaining the background for the decision.He added that the reform will allow Isro to focus more on research and development activities and also help in preventing the brain drain of Indian talent while enhancing the socio economic use of space assets and activities including approved access to existing space assets at facilities. “In the last 2-3 years, PM Modi has given a special boost to exploration of space through enhancing our launching activities and exploration of space through extra-launching activities,” Singh said. Singh added that India was now using space technology in every sphere of activity and the space tech has reached every household. He said the time has come to enhance India’s capacity in the sector by providing a level playing field.In other important decisions, the Union cabinet has approved a scheme for interest subvention of 2% to Shishu loan category borrowers under Pradhan Mantri Mudra Yojana, outstanding as on 31st March 2020, for a period of 12 months to eligible borrowers.The government also announced that it had cleared the development of an international airport at Uttar Pradesh’s Kushinagar. Javadekar said that a three-kilometer-long air strip has already been constructed there to facilitate the landing of big aircrafts like the airbus. This is being done for the benefit of tourists travelling on the Buddhist circuit. The work on the upgrade of infrastructure of the Airport has been ongoing and it will further pick up pace, he added.He also announced that ONGC will invest an additional Rs 909 crore in two gas blocks in Myanmar, namely A1 and A3. Exploration of these blocks will begin with the allocation. India is already invested in Myanmar gas blocks in partnership with South Korea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/government-opens-up-space-sector-and-assets-to-private-sector-to-enhance-capacity/story-hCn1tdDWhJTlRaZ0e4OeoN.html

Post-lockdown power bills shock consumers in Madhya Pradesh||Post-lockdown power bills have come as a shock to consumers in Madhya Pradesh prompting the state government to announce setting up of camps in every assembly constituency to redress the grievances of consumers. The government has also announced relief to those enjoying subsidised power under its scheme, as per energy department officials and complaints from people.According to officials, the power bills have affected every section of society. A state BJP office-bearer in Bhopal who usually used to receive a bill of about Rs 15,000 per month against his domestic connection got a bill of more than Rs 50,000 in June.Surendra Singh, a retired government official in Gwalior, used to receive bills of about Rs 2,000-2,500 during winters and Rs 3,500-4,500 during summers. He was jolted with a bill that amounted to Rs 19,000 this month. In Sagar, a shopkeeper - whose shop was closed for nearly two months amid the Covid-19 lockdown - got a bill of more than Rs 4,800.Also read: Shivraj Singh Chouhan’s jab at Rahul Gandhi includes reminder of BJP’s role in oppositionAnshul Bhargava, the shopkeeper in Sagar said, “I have got a bill of Rs 4,818. I regularly checked for bills online too but didn’t get any. Otherwise, my shop was closed for two months. Then how is this bill justified?”The BJP office-bearer who didn’t want to be named said, “I understand that June’s bill covered two months but this amount is mind-boggling. How come this comes to Rs 50,000? Since it’s BJP which is in power, I can’t lodge any protest in public on the issue.” In districts like Jabalpur, Seoni, Ashok Nagar, Rajgarh, Ratlam, Gwalior, among others, people have protested on the matter in the past week or so.As per government officials, during the lockdown period, the consumers received electricity bills, amounting to the usual figure, in April and May. The bills were based on the power consumption in March. The officials added that as more people were indoors during the lockdown in April and May, people ended up consuming more electricity and the power units were charged as per the higher slab of the tariff in June.This calculation of the power distribution companies also affected those who enjoyed subsidised power under various government schemes. This was due to the change in the government in March and changes in the scheme too.A government official said, “The previous BJP government headed by chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan had announced Sambal scheme for subsidised power to unorganised sector labourers, vendors and farmers with a smallholding of land at Rs 200 per month subject to the consumption of power up to 1 kW, ahead of 2018 assembly elections. More than 80 lakh consumers got themselves registered.”He said, “When the Congress formed its government in December 2018, it replaced Sambal with Indira Jyoti Yojna under which a power consumer was supposed to pay Rs 100 for 100 units of electricity if he didn’t consume more than 100 units of power in a month. If a consumer’s meter reading didn’t show more than 150 units of power in a month, he was supposed to pay Rs 100 for the first 100 units and normal rates for the next 50 units. It was around Rs 400 per month. But if a consumer consumed more than 150 units of power in a month, all units were charged as per the higher slab of the tariff. It was about Rs 6.30 per unit from 151 to 300 units and Rs 6.50 per unit for units above 300.”The official said that since the present government had dumped Indira Jyoti Yojna and replaced it with the Sambal scheme, the software was to be updated for the Sambal scheme beneficiaries by mid-June but it couldn’t be done. Hence, the power units of these beneficiaries too were charged as per normal rates. Hence, those who used to get the bill of about Rs 400 per month have now got the bill amounting to Rs 1,000-2,000.On Monday, chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan announced a relief to Sambal scheme beneficiaries provided they had bills of up to Rs 400 in April.“The decision about the remaining bills will be subject to scrutiny”, said the CM while interacting with consumers from different regions.Given the complaints regarding the power bills from across the state, the cabinet decided on Tuesday to hold camps in every assembly constituency to rectify the bills against complaints as told by home minister Narottam Mishra.State Congress president’s media coordinator Narendra Saluja said, “Hefty electricity bills have given a shock to all sections of society. By dumping Indira Jyoti Yojna, the government has fleeced people belonging to the weaker section. The CM announced relief only because of the ensuing bypolls to 24 assembly constituencies. But it is misleading as it is full of ifs and buts and in effect, no one is going to get benefit from the same.”Principal secretary, state energy department Sanjay Dubey said, “We are looking into complaints of power bills. Fact remains that during the lockdown the power consumption grew in homes. However, if anyone comes with a complaint that he has been charged extra, I will take immediate action on this.” (With inputs from Anupam Pateriya in Sagar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/electricity-bill-worth-rs-50-000-post-lockdown-power-bills-shock-consumers-in-madhya-pradesh/story-ML28dKfR5AOZfaXaVBczrO.html
24-06-2020||India||‘BNA built my base as an actor’||The journey of actor Nalneesh Neel, who was seen in ‘Fukrey’ and ‘Chichhorey’, to Mumbai has been a long one. Coming from a small village near Bisalpur in Pilibhit, Neel, who was last seen, as the speech impaired servant of Big B, in ‘Gulabo Sitabo’, recalled he was interested in performing arts since the beginning.“I started doing theatre in Shahjahanpur before joining the Bhartendu Natya Academy (BNA) in Lucknow. I have realized that if I would have not gone to BNA I would have not survived in Mumbai. It built my base as an actor,” he said over phone.“I come from a small village and grew up in the rural belt of Shahjahanpur at my maternal grandmother’s home. I dabbled in many things since beginning. I learnt martial arts and to dance too. I also sang at ‘jagrans’, handled rented VCRs in nights and did videography in marriages as well for a living,” he recalled. Neel said that he had shifted to Shahjahanpur to learn nuances of acting from actor Rajpal Yadav’s mentor Dalip Anand of Coronation Art Theatre. He remembers Dalip telling him that ‘not everyone can become Rajpal Yadav!’ “But, I was determined. I started doing ‘nukkad nataks’ (street corner plays), did ‘Godan’ and other plays in Shahjahanpur, Bareilly and Pilibhit,” he recalled.Neel wanted to go to National School of Drama (NSD) but got selected in Lucknow’s Bhartendu Natya Academy (BNA) instead. That was in 2008-10. “I learnt under Suryamohan Kulshresthaji, Jugal Kishor sir, Urmilji (Thalpliyal) and others. I started doing plays and then came to Mumbai with Rs 18,000 that I had borrowed from someone,” he said.Recalling his role in Gulabo Sitabo, a film whose story is based in Lucknow, and in which he played the role of a speech impaired servant, he said, “To act with dialogues is easier but to express without words is very tough. Shoojit da (Sircar) had hired a sign language trainer too so that we get it right. Actually, I had also played a mute character in ‘The Smoking Barrels,’ a short film,” he said.He bagged the role in Gulabo Sitabo after Sircar watched him in the upcoming flick ‘Bhor’.“I am among the three main leads in the film Bhor which has already been to many film festivals and would soon release on OTT. Shoojit da was impressed with my role and called me for the audition. Initially, my character had dialogues though later it was decided that the character would play the role of a speech impaired servant,” he said.Gulabo Sitabo is his second project with Big B. He had done an advertisement with him earlier. Neel has also done an international film ‘The White Tiger’ which is scheduled for release by the year end on OTT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/bna-built-my-base-as-an-actor/story-ATda6DYaT6d3z7rRir5T5H.html

The move to bring them under the RBI will give depositors the assurance that their savings are safe in these banks,” Javadekar said.Earlier this year in February, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had announced the government’s intention to bring the cooperative banks under RBI’s supervision and said that it will be done through an amendment to the Banking regulation act. Javadekar said the government had issued an ordinance in this respect on Wednesday.According to the new dispensation, the appointment of CEOs in such cooperative banks will now require prior approval from the regulatory authority- the RBI.The government had earlier said that there was a need to enhance accountability of these banks which hold public money and are often riddled in controversies around mismanagement and corruption.The government moves follows several instances of fraud and cheating in banks through cooking of books, mismanagement of loans etc, resulting in a threat to deposits and stability of the country’s financial system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1500-cooperative-banks-with-nearly-rs-5-lakh-crore-assets-brought-under-rbi-supervision/story-ofxwrlScgV3AtcBDpmPCiM.html

24-06-2020||India||Galwan clash: China levels fresh blame against India, says New Delhi provoked clash||China on Wednesday launched a twin diplomatic tirade against India with its foreign and defence ministries blaming New Delhi for the Galwan Valley clash on June 15 and alleging that the external affairs ministry (MEA) and Indian media were spreading false information about the incident.A day after referring to the military commander-level talks of June 22 as an effort to “lower the temperature” and “properly handle differences”, the two ministries separately castigated New Delhi for violating bilateral agreements, international rules and provoking the clash.The mention of “international rules” by the Chinese foreign ministry could have been in the context of external affairs minister, S Jaishankar mentioning the importance of following international rules during the Russia, India, China foreign ministers’ meet.Also read: How the Galwan Valley tragedy can transform Himalayan geopoliticsThe deadly brawl left 20 Indian army soldiers dead and caused unspecified number of casualties to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).When asked why the Chinese foreign ministry was repeating the points of contention – New Delhi has summarily dismissed Beijing’s one-sided version of the incident – despite renewed talks of peace and tranquility at border, spokesperson, Zhao Lijian had this to say at today’s ministry briefing: “What I have just said, my statement just now is meant to clarify the whole situation, tell the truth to everyone. We made the statement because the MEA in India and also Indian media have made some false reports.”ALSO WATCH | ‘Need to respect international law..’: Jaishankar in a meet with China, Russia On Tuesday, Zhao had dismissed as “fake news” a statement by Indian minister VK Singh that the PLA could have suffered double the number of casualties compared to the Indian army.In the statement he read out after the ministry briefing was over, Zhao said that early morning on May 6, “…India’s border troops under the guise of darkness, trespassed into China’s territory and provoked the incident. China’s troops had to take necessary measures to strengthen their response and their management of the border areas.”Also read: The Galwan Valley face-off explained through 17 news reports“Secondly, it is the Indian side that went against bilateral agreement and provoked first. Because of our diplomatic and military representations, the Indian side at first agreed to withdraw personnel from Galwan Valley and so it did, and it dismantled its facilities as requested by the Chinese side,” Zhao added.Zhao then continued to give the so-called step-by-step account of the incident.“During the first Commanders’ meeting on June 6, the Indian side committed no trespassing of the Galwan Valley for patrol and for building. The two sides agreed to set up observatory posts at the two sides of the Galwan river estuary, but the Indian side went against these agreements and asked China to dismantle China’s posts and also it crossed the Line to provoke which led to the clash,” he said.There was no immediate reaction from the Indian side to the claims levelled by Zhao. Zhao continued: In the evening of June 15, India’s frontline troops went against the agreement reached at the Commander-level meeting, crossed the LAC and sabotaged the tents Chinese side set up.”“When China’s border troops went to negotiate as per protocol, the Indian side suddenly attacked Chinese personnel violently, which led to fierce physical clashes and casualties. This risky behaviour by the Indian side greatly violated the agreement between the two countries and the basic norms guiding international relation. It’s very serious, with very severe consequences.” On the June 22 talks, he said: “We hope this time the Indian side will strictly follow the agreement and work with China to take concrete actions and resume peace and stability in the border areas”.Separately, the Chinese defence ministry too took aim at India on Wednesday, repeating nearly word-for-word earlier Chinese statements.Speaking at online interaction with selected media, defence ministry spokesperson, Wu Qian said: “But what is shocking is that on the evening of June 15th, the Indian front-line frontier troops openly violated the consensus reached by the two sides, turned their backs, and once again crossed the actual control line to deliberately provoke China”.“While negotiating on the spot, Chinese officers and soldiers were suddenly violently attacked by the Indian side. This triggered intense physical clashes between officers and soldiers on both sides, resulting in casualties.”India has already rejected twice China’s claims on the skirmish. India on June 20, for the second time, rejected China’s claim on Galwan Valley in Ladakh and reiterated that the violent clash of June 15 was triggered by Chinese efforts to build structures on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).The external affairs ministry dismissed claims made by China’s foreign ministry in a statement issued regarding both sovereignty over Galwan Valley and the genesis of the clash on Monday night that left 20 Indian soldiers dead.External affairs ministry spokesperson Anurag Srivastava had said the position with regard to Galwan Valley was “historically clear”. He added, “Attempts by the Chinese side to now advance exaggerated and untenable claims with regard to Line of Actual Control (LAC) there are not acceptable. They are not in accordance with China’s own position in the past.”Srivastava further said the brawl of June 15 was the result of “violent actions” by Chinese troops after they were prevented by Indian soldiers from building structures on the Indian side of the LAC. He noted senior military commanders of the two sides had agreed during a meeting on June 6 on a process for de-escalation and disengagement along the LAC that “involved reciprocal actions”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/galwan-clash-china-levels-fresh-blame-against-india-says-new-delhi-provoked-clash/story-sz6W2lOTXGRRQpOZaLuofJ.html

The decision taken is in line with the long-term vision of Prime Minister Narendra Modi of transforming India and making the country self-reliant and technologically advanced.The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) will continue to play its role, the government emphasised, adding that the new organization will supplement it.“It’ll guide the private industries in space activities through encouraging policies in a friendly regulatory environment,” said Jitendra Singh, minister of state for atomic energy & space.The Public Sector Enterprise ‘New Space India Limited (NSIL)’ will endeavour to re-orient space activities from a ‘supply driven’ model to a ‘demand driven’ model, thereby ensuring optimum utilisation of space assets.The minister added that the move will “unlock India’s potential in space sector”. The government underscored that it will also hand-hold, promote and guide the private industries in space activities.These reforms, the government anticipates, will allow ISRO to focus more on research and development activities, new technologies, exploration missions and human spaceflight programme. Some of the planetary exploration missions will also be opened up to private sector through an ‘announcement of opportunity’ mechanism, the government added.India is among a handful of countries with advanced capabilities in the space sector. With these reforms, the government hopes the sector will receive new energy and dynamism, to help the country leapfrog to the next stages of space activities.The government is of the view that the space sector can play a major catalytic role in the technological advancement and expansion of the country’s industrial base. The proposed reforms will enhance the socio-economic use of space assets and activities, including through improved access to space assets, data and facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/will-unlock-india-s-potential-in-space-minister-as-govt-opens-sector/story-VWewqMQMMf09AO0esDOhLJ.html

Also read: Black rice grown successfully for first time in PrayagrajAssistant general manager of APEDA, CB Singh, said 900 quintals (90 metric tonnes) of black paddy, which has anti-diabetic qualities, had been produced by a group of around 300 farmers in Chandauli district. Per kilogram price of paddy is Rs 85 and after processing, it comes for Rs 160.He said there is a plan to export this rice. In the beginning, it will be exported to Australia and New Zealand and later to other countries. A formal meeting between the exporter and farmers was organized in the district so that the farmers sell the produce to the exporters.Singh said the APEDA was motivating more farmers to grow black rice because of the soil of Chandauli district was very favourable for paddy farming.

In his application, he pleaded that an accused booked for murder does not fall under the category of prisoners who cannot be released from jail as recommended by the high power committee of the Bombay High Court.The CBI in its objection on Friday said that though the minutes of high power committee did not include murder charges, in the list of charges for which the bail cannot be granted, the court has to decide the plea on the merits. The agency claimed that the prosecution has submitted enough evidence against Khanna to prove his role in the alleged murder of Sheena and subsequent act of destruction of her body and other evidence.After considering arguments from both sides, the court refused to grant any relief to Khanna. The detailed order would be made available to lawyers later.Meanwhile, Indran Mukerjea, approached the special CBI court for bail for the sixth time. While her previous bail plea is still pending for arguments by CBI, the fresh plea has been filed on the ground of the spread of Covid 19 in Mumbai’s Byculla jail. She has claimed that she is vulnerable to infection from the virus. The special court has asked the CBI to respond to the plea by Friday and scheduled arguments on the plea by July 1.Sheena Bora disappeared on April 24, 2012. On May 23 that year, police found a decomposed body in Pen, Raigad district which turned out to be Sheena’s.Indrani Mukherjea was arrested by the Mumbai Police on August 25, 2015 after a three-year probe. Indrani’s ex-husband Sanjeev Khanna was arrested in Kolkata the next day.On September 18, 2015, the Maharashtra government transferred the case to the CBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-court-rejects-sanjeev-khanna-s-bail-plea-in-sheena-bora-murder-case/story-qs36ugVluebrQEON2t39PN.html
24-06-2020||India||‘No guests, no music’: When a cruise ship turned into a ferry service||A cruise, Celebrity Infinity, from Miami in the United States was the first such ship to dock at the Goa’s Mormugao port last week in more than three months and did so only as a ferry to bring back 1,450 seafarers from the state who were stranded in different ports of the world. Capt Rajat Sharma, a marine pilot, has steered hundreds of cruise ships, but nothing could prepare him for the ‘surreal’ experience of piloting the Celebrity Infinity, a 11,788 DWT nearly 300m long cruise ship that sailed into Goa’s Mormugao Port on June 18. “It was hard to believe it’s the same world we are living in... no guests, no music, no people, in the hall,” said Capt Sharma.The once vibrant global cruise tourism industry has been forced to drop anchor, with thousands of seafarers finding that their contracts have been abruptly cancelled. While some cruise tourism companies have been chartering flights to ensure their staff can return home, others have decided to convert ships into ferries as repatriation flights have been difficult to access. “Having piloted more than 100 cruise ships in Goa port, the experience was very different. The handshakes were replaced with sanitisers, broad smiles were replaced with masked people. The warmth I used to get from ship staff is replaced with a sense of fear,” Capt Sharma recounted. “And the scene on the way to the bridge was not very pleasant. Some cabins were taped with yellow ribbons. Some cabins had food packets kept at the door. Not sure whether they were quarantined or the ship staff is following company SOP. It was like someone took the life out of that cruise ship. Now she’s just a ferry going from point A to B,” he added. Tourism has been the hardest hit sector due to the coronavirus pandemic sweeping across the globe. Goa, which majorly depends on tourism, has been feeling the effect. The state has lost out on at least 15 cruise ships that were scheduled to make a port call at Mormugao before the season ended with the start of the monsoon. Cruise passenger tourists have jumped from a mere 1,500 at the turn of the century in 2001-02 to nearly 1-lakh last year as vessels have got bigger and better and safer. The launch of regular cruise service between Goa and Mumbai and Mauritius helped the cause.Goa was expecting in excess of 50 cruise ship arrivals, but only 38 arrived before the season was cut short. However, cruise companies are confident of a post pandemic revival. “The tourism industry is the most affected sector. The industry is suffering significant disruption which has largely impacted every sector of tourism, including the airline, hotel, travel, and cruise among others. In the past too we have grappled with many uncertainties we have managed to recover. This is because the travel industry is resilient and we are confident in making strong headwinds on our return,” Jurgen Bailom, President and CEO, Jalesh Cruises that runs a regular cruise service with Goa as one of the stops, said. “Tourism globally is at a halt and will be for a while. However, in the coming future, if not international travel, domestic tourism will resume, as cruise tourism will be one of the first,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-guests-no-music-when-a-cruise-ship-turned-into-a-ferry-service/story-fXud230Hxr2lQOFCRBCXgM.html

24-06-2020||India||Got your house or car sanitised yet? Here’s a new service in demand||Covered in PPE kits and armed with gloves and disinfection equipment, volunteers from Delhi-based Right to Safety Foundation are going around south Delhi, offering sanitisation services at minimal prices. For the last two months, the organisation has had their hands full. “Government has tried their best to sanitise outdoor areas but the problem goes beyond that. So we decided to help people out with indoor sanitisation,” says Aamir Ayyub, who founded the organisation to be able to give back to the society. The group volunteers to disinfect homes, offices and shops at a nominal cost. “We charge ₹100 per room in which bathroom, kitchen, and balcony are also covered, and so far people have been very welcoming of the subsidised services. We also educate people on different sanitisation measures,’’ adds Ayyub. His foundation has so far covered around 500 houses. They have even disinfected a few places of worship, police stations and even fire stations, for free. But safety doesn’t end at one’s house or workplace. People are also investing in sanitisation of their vehicles as they resume commuting on the roads. A mobile vehicle disinfection stand established by Rajesh Kumar in south Delhi’s Lado Sarai, is one such example. A former graphic designer, Kumar says he thought of helping people stay safe during the pandemic via on-road sanitisation services. “We are slowly expanding to different parts of the Capital via mobile stands. Our prices are subsidised and we ensure that we comply with all safety measures,” adds Kumar, sharing that the footfall has been slow but steady. “Hopefully more people will understand the need of disinfecting exposed surfaces in the coming days,” says Kumar. And Sweety Asthana, a resident of RK Puram, emphasises on the idea of mobile disinfection services, saying, “Indoor and on-road sanitisation are great ideas. I was informed of these services by a relative in south Delhi, who got her car sanitised while travelling to work. I’ve elderly parents, and the disinfection process ensures that they are protected from getting the virus.’’ There are also some private players who have expanded their basic services to cover the needs that arose during the pandemic. Once such service provider even used its germ-shield technology to sanitise the Gurugram Police control room. Sandeep Aggarwal, head of the online motorplace, says, “We have extended our servicing beyond automobiles to societies and offices as well; wherein they require us to sanitise high footfall places like elevators and ATMs. The demand with individuals has also risen exponentially and we will be expanding, as preventing surface to surface transmission is the primary way to counter coronavirus.”Author Tweets @Bhagat_MallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/coronavirus-crisis/got-your-house-or-car-sanitised-yet-here-s-a-new-service-in-demand/story-zXdzIV8mzoIV7VDikYzglO.html

The plan includes conducting sero-survey of 20,000 people across districts in the national capital and house-to-house screening by July 6, among other measures.Earlier in the day, Delhi deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia said he has written to Union Home Minister Amit Shah, urging him to roll-back the order, issued by Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal. Also read: Sisodia writes to Amit Shah, seeks scrapping of new Covid-19 SOPsDelhi govt prepares eight-point 'Revised COVID Response Plan' in line with recommendations of Dr VK Paul committee. The plan includes conducting sero-survey of 20,000 people across districts and house-to-house screening by July 6, among other measures.The order requires Covid-19 patient - who had tested positive through the real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test - to be taken to a Covid-19 Care Centre (CCC) for a clinical diagnosis of the viral infection symptoms.“It’s not a matter of Amit Shah model versus Arvind Kejriwal model of fighting Covid-19. It’s about ensuring minimum inconvenience to the public and also the administrative machinery fighting against the pandemic is not overburdened,” Sisodia said during a virtual briefing today.ALSO WATCH |Manish Sisodia asks Amit Shah to intervene, asks to scrap new covid SOPs On Monday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced that all those under home-isolation will be provided with pulse oximeters to measure oxygen levels every few hours.“Once you are well, you can return it to the government,” the Delhi CM said adding that the Covid-19 situation, as of now, seems to be stabilizing.“Patients under home-isolation can monitor their oxygen level and in case of drop, they can call on a number that we will provide and our team will immediately visit and administer oxygen to the patient. The patient will be rushed to the hospital if there is a requirement,’ he stated.

24-06-2020||India||Over 73.5 lakh samples tested for Covid-19 in India till June 23: ICMR||Over 73.5 lakh samples have been tested for Covid-19 till June 23, of which 2.15 lakh were examined on Tuesday, the highest in a day since the beginning of the pandemic, ICMR officials said on Wednesday.The apex health research body on Tuesday validated the 1,000th testing laboratory, ramping up the capacity for detection of Covid-19 in the country. Currently, three lakh samples can be tested per day, an official said.“A cumulative total of 73,52,911 samples have been tested up to June 23, with 2,15,195 samples being tested on Tuesday,” the ICMR said.Of the 1,000 Covid-19 testing laboratories, 730 are in government setups while 270 are in the private sector. This includes RT-PCR labs (557), TrueNat Labs (363) and CBNAAT Labs (80).  “However, in spite of these developments, access to testing still remains a huge challenge in a large country like India. There is a definite need to increase the outreach of testing by introducing rapid point of care diagnostic tests,” the ICMR noted in its advisory issued on Tuesday.Also, there is value in conducting serosurvey with IgG-based antibody tests in certain situations, it said.In view of this, it is now suggested to include additional testing methods to improve access and availability of testing in various parts of the country, the health research body said.The real-time RT-PCR is the gold standard test for detecting cases of Covid-19 and the average time taken is around 4-5 hours from receipt of sample to getting the result.“The advantage of this platform lies in its accuracy of detection as well as ability to run up to 90 samples in a single run. In view of the requirement of a specialised laboratory setup, this test cannot be performed at every district-level lab which does not have molecular virology facilities,” the ICMR said.The TrueNat and the CBNAAT systems have also been deployed for diagnosis of Covid-19 in view of availability of customised cartridges.These platforms have widespread availability even at district and primary health centre levels as these are widely used for diagnosis of tuberculosis and other infectious diseases. These platforms have a quick turnaround time (30-60 minutes) but only one-four samples can be tested in one run, limiting the maximum number that can be tested to 24-48 samples per day only, the ICMR said.The ICMR recently also approved the use of rapid-antigen test for coronavirus infection that gives results in 30 minutes.It has recommended deployment of rapid antigen detection test for Covid-19  in combination with the RT-PCR test in all containment zones, central and state government medical colleges and government hospitals, private hospitals approved by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare (NABH), and all NABL-accredited and ICMR-approved private labs for Covid-19 testing.It has also advised that the rapid antibody test for Covid-19 should be performed only for surveillance purposes, and not diagnosis, to help allay fears and anxiety of healthcare workers and employees.The IgG antibodies generally start appearing after two weeks of onset of the infection once the individual has recovered, and these last for several months.It can be used to conduct serosurvey to understand the proportion of the population exposed to infection with SARS-CoV-2, including asymptomatic individuals, and to carry out survey in high-risk or vulnerable populations (healthcare workers, frontline workers, immunocompromised individuals, individuals in containment zones etc) to know who had been infected in the past and has now recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-73-5-lakh-samples-tested-for-covid-19-in-india-till-june-23-icmr/story-qqw13nQ1SHaBNSDfooYQ6N.html

Rajasthan is one of the most affected states as some districts - Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, Barmer, Ganganagar - share border with Pakistan from where locusts are entering other districts,” BR Kadwa, deputy director of Rajasthan agriculture department, was quoted by news agency ANI as saying.“Operations are on to control them. Issue is, we had killed older swarms but new swarms are coming now. Government of India has said that Navy helicopter will also be used to control it,” he added.Locusts have made border areas near Pakistan their breeding centres from where they’re coming here, said Kadwa.The onset of monsoon in Rajasthan is likely to occur on June 24 or 25 and authorities at Jodhpur-based Locust Warning Organisation (LWO) are preparing to control the population of locusts that are hovering in the desert areas between India and neighbouring Pakistan and also possible local breeding of these insects.Aerial spraying of insecticides is being done by drones in Barmer, Jaisalmer, Bikaner, Nagore and Jodhpur districts for locust control, Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare had said on Tuesday.“Under Make in India initiative in locust control, trials of prototype vehicle mounted ULV sprayer has been successfully conducted in Ajmer and Bikaner; approvals required for commercial launch are underway,” the ministry said.United Nation’s Food and Agriculture Organization has appreciated that India is the first country in the world which is controlling Desert Locust through Drones, it added.Emphasising the need of exploring aerial spray for locust control, the ministry said that the ground control vehicles with sprayers used for locust control can spray up to a height of 25-30 feet only. The tractor mounted sprayers also have a limitation in reaching inaccessible areas and tall trees.Locust is a crop-threatening migratory pest that has entered the country through the India-Pakistan border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rajasthan-facing-locust-attack-from-new-swarms-say-authorities/story-9AHvsnbKtrtO4KiKACofcP.html
24-06-2020||India||Govt relaxes manufacturing norms for PPE makers||The government has relaxed norms of having in-house testing for three kinds of Personal Protective Equipments (PPEs) to promote the supply of quality gears during the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, according to an official order. The norms have been relaxed for filter half masks, surgical face masks and eye protectors by the Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS). Earlier, license to manufacture these products was given to those having in-house testing facilities. This norm has been relaxed and manufacturers are now required to test the samples for specified requirements in labs of BIS licensees who have in-house testing facilities, or in BIS recognised or empanelled private or government labs, it added. “This has been done to enable more manufacturers to be brought in the ambit of BIS product certification scheme, which will in turn result in greater quantity of BIS certified PPEs being made available to the users,” the BIS said. BIS is a national standards body that functions under the Consumer Affairs Ministry. It has framed more than 25,000 quality standards for different products/services. Based on the data obtained from 81 mask manufacturers, BIS said it has been found that their current installed annual 2ply/3 ply surgical masks production capacities are 295 crore. Currently, masks and hand sanitizers have been declared as essential items till June. Its prices are fixed by the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-relaxes-manufacturing-norms-for-ppe-makers/story-sX0YDA4tVLaVB8El63VW0M.html
24-06-2020||India||‘Modi govt ‘unlocked’ Covid-19 epidemic, petrol-diesel rates’: Rahul Gandhi||Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday took a swipe at the Modi government’s Unlock 1 move, a three-phase plan aimed at lifting stringent restrictions imposed over two months ago to stop the spread of the coronavirus, by drawing attention to how it has ‘unlocked’ the petrol and diesel prices and resulted in a sharp increase in the coronavirus caseload. “The Modi government has “unlocked” the Corona epidemic and petrol-diesel prices,” tweeted Gandhi this morning, with a graph chart detailing the northward spike in both Covid-19 cases and the fuel prices.  मोदी सरकार ने कोरोना महामारी और पेट्रोल-डीज़ल की क़ीमतें "अन्लॉक" कर दी हैं। pic.twitter.com/ty4aeZVTxqSome commentators are of the view that India went into lockdown early. Other countries, they say, lifted their lockdown when their disease curve had started to deflate, but here the restrictions are being eased as the curve is going up exponentially.Earlier today, the country reported 15,968 fresh cases of the coronavirus disease and 465 deaths, in the highest single-day jump so far, taking the infection tally to 456,183, the Union health ministry data showed. The country has seen record rise in cases over the past week. In another development, the price of diesel was hiked for the 18th day in a row today, making it costlier than petrol in Delhi. On each of the 17 days leading up to Wednesday, both petrol and diesel had become costlier, but only diesel prices were hiked today.The Congress leader, who has been attacking the Centre over the China standoff, today changed tracks and shone a light on the spiralling Covid-19 cases in the country and the steady rise in fuel prices.Through a graph, titled ‘Coronavirus is not the only rising curve’, Gandhi tried to show how diesel and petrol prices as well as daily Covid cases have seen a steady climb since June 1, when the Unlock phase 1 began. Explaining the Covid-19 numbers, the health ministry, citing a report by the World Health Organization (WHO), said on Tuesday that India has one of the lowest deaths per lakh population in the world. It said India’s cases of death per lakh population is 1.00 while the global average is more than its six times, at 6.04.Most of India’s Covid-19 cases come from Maharashtra, Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat, which have seen a steady rise in the number of infections and deaths.The increase in fuel rates started on June 7 this year as oil companies resumed daily revision in prices in line with costs after ending an 82-day gap during the Covid-19 lockdown. It has taken diesel prices to fresh highs and petrol price too is at a two-year high.The government has been facing Opposition’s ire over the daily increase in fuel prices. The Congress said on Tuesday that it will launch a ‘Jan Andolan’ (people’s movement) across the country soon against the hike.The Trinamool Congress said it is “disgraceful to unleash a planned disaster” on the common people at a time when the country is in the throes of a pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-govt-unlocked-covid-19-epidemic-petrol-diesel-rates-rahul-gandhi/story-rjtdxQgeL22mRxLSOJfQjP.html

Before them, two women left the facility with fully recovered children after spending more than two weeks in the ward.“I salute these mothers who despite being at severe risk are taking care of their children in the Covid-19 ward. None of them was infected but no one knows how their children got this virus. We are treating them and hopefully they will be cured and go home like the others,” said a doctor.The children, aged between three and four years, are the morale boosters for the other 50 patients admitted to the ward. Their activities and frolic keep the patients entertained and those sitting in the central control room watching the CCTV feed can’t stop smiling.“During the day, they play a lot and their mothers keep running after them. They feed them, put them to sleep and ensure they are given medicines on time,” said the doctor posted at the control room in the deputy principal’s office.According to health officials, there is no rule or a guideline that says a non-infected person cannot stay with a Covid-19 patient in the hospital.A woman, whose daughter was admitted to the hospital in May with Covid-19, said her child was so young that she could not have left her with the health workers in the hospital. “Nothing is more important than my daughter. I immediately volunteered to take care of her even it meant putting my life at stake. With the blessings of God nothing happened. I was tested twice and each time I came out negative,” she said.Deputy principal of GSVM medical college and superintendent in chief of LLR hospital, Dr Richa Giri, said indeed there was provision of very young Covid-19 infected children staying with their mother in the ward but at times one faced issues having no immediate solution in sight.“We do not have enough people to take care of such small children but we keep a close watch and ensure the mothers are protected and wear masks all the time,” she said, adding work was on for new arrangements so mothers would not have to put up with the infected children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-covid-19-risk-women-in-kanpur-nurse-their-infected-children-in-hospital/story-hsq4PPfyykScou0V4Avi9N.html
24-06-2020||India||Covid testing should be widely available to all symptomatic individuals: ICMR||Expanding the testing criterion for coronavirus, the Indian Council of Medical Research has said it should be made widely available to all symptomatic individuals across the country. “Since ‘test, track and treat’ is the only way to prevent spread of infection and save lives, it is imperative that testing should be made widely available to all symptomatic individuals in every part of the country and contact tracing mechanisms for containment of infection are further strengthened,” it said in an advisory on ‘Newer Additional Strategies for Covid-19 Testing’ on Tuesday. In its revised testing strategy for Covid-19 issued on May 18, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had advised testing for all symptomatic Influenza-like illness (ILI) among returnees and migrants within seven days of illness. All hospitalised patients who develop ILI symptoms, symptomatic individuals living within hotspots or containment zones and healthcare and frontline workers involved in containment and mitigation of coronavirus were also advised testing. The apex health research body has also advised authorities to enable all government and private hospitals, offices and public sector units to perform antibody-based Covid-19 testing for surveillance to help allay fears and anxiety of healthcare workers and office employees. The earlier advisories on rapid antibody testing advisories had focused on areas reporting clusters (containment zones), large migration gatherings/evacuees centers and testing of symptomatic ILI individuals at facility level. Besides, the ICMR on Tuesday also recommended deployment of rapid antigen detection tests for Covid-19 in combination with RT-PCR tests in all containment zones, all central and state government medical colleges and government hospitals, all private hospitals approved by the National Accreditation Board for Hospitals and Healthcare (NABH), all NABL-accredited and ICMR approved private labs, for Covid-19 testing.All hospitals, laboratories and state governments intending to perform the point-of-care antigen tests need to register with ICMR to obtain the login credentials for data entry.“ICMR advises all state governments, public and private institutions concerned to take required steps to scale up testing for Covid-19 by deploying combination of various tests as advised,” the advisory added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-testing-should-be-widely-available-to-all-symptomatic-individuals-icmr/story-PtTK7v1lVmGDHzSuCjD8UK.html

24-06-2020||India||Covid-19 impact: UP govt likely to defer panchayat polls for six months||With the Uttar Pradesh government busy mobilising resources to combat the Covid-19 pandemic, the three-tier panchayat polls that are due in November-December in the state are most likely to be put on hold.People aware of the development said that the state government is likely to defer panchayat polls for six months and, as permitted under the law, appoint administrators in place of pradhans (village chiefs) before their five-year term ends on December 25.“Considering the fact that multi-stage activities that normally start six months prior to the polls are not even being talked of at the government level or in the panchayati raj department, clearly indicates that the government is not in the mood to hold panchayat polls,” said a senior panchayati raj department official requesting anonymity.Panchayati raj minister Bhupendra Chaudhary, however, said the government would make efforts to hold rural polls on time. “While any deferment of polls will be a policy decision and I cannot comment on that at this juncture, all that I can say we still have sufficient time to make preparations and hold elections on time,” he said.According to sources, the ball for the panchayat polls always starts rolling after the state government issued the notification with regard to delimitation of village panchayats and of territorial constituencies (wards) within panchayats.“This is only after delimitation notification that the state election commission (SEC) starts revision of voter lists. Before elections, the state government also has to carry out a protracted exercise of reservation of posts of pradhans etc,” they said. Additional commissioner, state election commission, VP Verma, said though it was running out of time the commission could still endeavour to manage holding polls on time by compressing the timelines provided in the government issued.“Our work begins only after the delimitation notification and we are waiting for the government to issue the same,” he said.People cited above said the state government did start the delimitation exercise that was left mid-way after the coronavirus made its appearance followed by over two-month lockdown in the state.“Though it has already made a budgetary allocation of around Rs 500 crore for the panchayat polls, the government now wants to mobilse funds and manpower to fight the coronavirus preferring to postpone elections for six months,” they said.The UP Panchayati Raj Act, 1947 empowers the state government to defer rural polls and appoint administrative committees or administrators for period not more than six months in case constitution of a village panchayat before expiry of its term is not possible for unavoidable circumstances.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-impact-up-govt-likely-to-defer-panchayat-polls-for-six-months/story-5ub5yN6JUrDr0SvflS2LlL.html

In a fresh SOS message to the information and broadcasting ministry, the industry body of private FM channels that are fighting for their survival suggested that the radio industry elsewhere was also in crisis. And they were getting help.In Canada, the AROI said in a letter to the I&B ministry, the Canadian government had agreed to waive the licence fee for broadcasters for the financial year 2020-21 that would save 100 radio and television stations over $ 30 million. The Canadian government has already committed a $30 million spending on federal ad spending for newspapers, magazines, radio and television on a Covid-19 awareness campaign.Back home in India, private FM radio operators have been struggling to stay afloat. In its multiple representations to the government, the AROI has underscored that the radio industry was on a ventilator and may have trouble surviving if it does not receive help from the government.AROI has been asking the government for a one-year waiver on all licence fees and charges by the government and Prasar Bharti, restoration of government advertising on radio, besides clearing payments from the government’s publicity department.In response, the government had given the industry a three-month extension of license fee payments without interest. The ministry has been prodding the government to do more.“We trust that the government is reviewing our request in interest of survival of this critical media , which is also in interest of the nation, as radio contributes annually almost Rs 800 crore a year (other than one time entry fee) to the government for every year of its license period and extensions thereof,” the AROI said in a communication to the government..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/private-fm-radio-operators-ask-centre-for-help-point-to-how-canada-has-done-it/story-gYnrljJxsgvJuO0C5DDVIM.html

Monsoon has already covered several parts of western Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday night. We will officially declare monsoon over Delhi on Thursday,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, RWFC.“We are expecting very good rains over north-west India this monsoon. Monsoon is setting in, but it can be declared on Thursday after collating the 24-hour rainfall data,” said Dr Mrutunjay Mohapatra, director general, IMD.IMD in its long-range monsoon forecast has predicted good rains in north-west India this monsoon at 107% of the long-period average (LPA).LPA is the average of rainfall received in the area over a 50-year period between 1951 and 2000.A cyclonic circulation lies over interior Odisha, which is very likely to move north-westwards during the next two days and become less marked thereafter. A trough of low pressure is also running from north-western Rajasthan to the north-western Bay of Bengal.

The state government has now made PPE kits mandatory for returning expats, medical experts say full PPE kits are not practical for long journeys as after wearing the kit it gets difficult to go to the washroom. Passengers will have to be trained to use them, experts reasoned. Kerala’s demand for Covid-free certificate has affected many flights and has outraged expatriates. Many said the state was only interested in maintaining its Covid-19 record and not the welfare of its people stranded in the Middle East.An estimated 18 lakh people from Kerala work in the Gulf. The government is expecting at least 4 lakh to return amid the Covid-19 crisis while at least 85,000 have returned so far.“We are in talks with the Centre for testing people who are returning to the state. Some of the embassies have informed us about their readiness. We hope this will be sorted out soon,” chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan had said, adding the state was firm on its decision to make carrying Covid-19 free certificates mandatory for expats. Earlier, the state had said certificates will be mandatory from June 20 but later it was extended by five more days.As confusion over expatriates’ return continues, Kerala reported 141 coronavirus cases, the highest single-day number since the outbreak began in January, on Tuesday. On Wednesday, the state Covid-19 tally rose to 3,451 with 22 fatalities while 1,809 people have recovered from the disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-govt-tones-down-demand-for-covid-free-certificates-for-returning-expats/story-wBuXZKBFfAfplMsJTf2tCN.html

But the move, a domestic rating agency said, is a “mildly negative” development for the Indian IT companies.“The temporary suspension of issuance of fresh H-1B visas and L-1 visas (inter-company transfer) till December 2020 in view of the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on the US economy and employment will be mildly negative for the Indian IT services sector,” ratings agency Investment and Credit Rating Agency (ICRA) said.The agency said that the petitions of India-based companies saw a 63 per cent decline in approval last year, compared to 2015. It said that only 6,855 H1-B visa applications were approved.The agency attributed the decline sponsor employer’s inability to establish that the position is a specialty occupation, inability to substantiate a valid employer-employee relationship and lack of evidence of specific assignment at third party sites for the entire visa durations requested.As a result, companies are relying less on such visas and building up domestic workforce in the United States, the ICRA said. “Cloud computing, digital services and automation are being used to reduce the reliance on manpower.”However, the ICRA said, Trump’s decision will hamper execution of projects in the pipeline and new projects, and also dent margins because of higher local hiring activity.Trump has directed his officials to separately overhaul the H-1B programme to turn it merit-based by prioritising highest paid applicants.The suspended work visas included H-1B, H-2B for low skill workers, some categories of J visas for cultural and education workers and L-1 for intra-company transfers. They were intended to ensure Americans had the first shot at jobs in the aftermath of record job losses caused by Covid-19 related lockdowns, and are expected to free up 5,25,000 jobs.The decision came as Trump od seeking re-election in the presidential election scheduled for November this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trump-s-visa-suspension-mildly-negative-for-indian-it-firms-says-rating-agency-icra/story-7FoM1KFVbnq2np3dnMfuEL.html

Another meeting will take place on Wednesday.Here are the latest updates on the border row:* Members of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs (WMCC) will meet and attempt to resolve the stand-off at four points in east Ladakh.* During the joint secretary-level WMCC meeting, the Indian side will have maps and charts ready and revoke to old treaties to make their point about how the claim by the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) on the border is wrong and why the status quo ante must be restored for a strong bilateral relationship.* Indian Army chief General MM Naravane, who is on a two-day visit to Ladakh, will go to forward locations in the eastern Ladakh area on Wednesday, according to news agency ANI. Gen Naravane will also interact with troops on the ground there, ANI reported.* ANI has also reported, citing US intelligence assessment, that a senior Chinese general authorised his forces to attack Indian troops in the Galwan River valley last week, resulting in a brutal skirmish that killed dozens and dramatically escalated tensions between the two neighbours. * Before Wednesday’s talks, an 11-hour meeting between top commanders at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC was held on Monday to cool tensions and thin the military build-up on both sides of the border. Indian and Chinese military commanders reached a “mutual consensus to disengage” from all “friction areas” along the contested LAC.* Experts have said that the restoration of status quo in the Finger Area on the north bank of Ladakh’s Pangong Tso will determine the success of efforts to cool tensions along the contested border. * PLA has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes and observation posts between Fingers Four and Eight and getting it to pull down those structures and move back to their original positions at Finger Eight will be the toughest part of the disengagement process, said an official asking not to be named. The Finger Area refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range that overlooks the Pangong Lake.* India has increased technical drone surveillance of the area and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) has inducted more battalions into the sector to support army along the LAC.* India has also deployed its specialised high-altitude forces along LAC to repel any transgression in the western, middle or eastern sectors, officials have said.* The violent face-off in the Galwan Valley resulted in 20 deaths on the Indian side and the PLA suffered 43 casualties, according to Indian officials, but Beijing has not confirmed the fatalities. A Chinese spokesperson on Tuesday dismissed such reports as “fake news”.* China had deployed up to 10,000 troops in these areas with the military buildup including fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence radars. India has matched the neighbour’s military moves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-joint-secretary-level-meet-to-indian-army-chief-s-visit-to-ladakh-latest-updates-on-india-china-border-face-off/story-0PIFjcQaOBnZEMQ44TADLI.html

Goa doesn’t have the capacity to handle the high volume of strandings,” Mitra said.Ocean Watch has urged the state government to set up a sea turtle treatment clinic.“A quick release with no follow-up action often leads to the death of a turtle,” Mitra said.Ocean Watch had also proposed to the state government about the recycling of abandoned fishing nets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-enough-being-done-for-stranded-marine-life-environmentalists-on-trapped-olive-ridley-turtles/story-VOIFzbznguccjo7g9OWRwK.html

Ramdev said it has been prepared after a clinical controlled study.Patanjali soon tweeted a photo of the newly-announced medicine and said that active components of herbs like Ashwaganda, Giloy and Tulsi have been used to prepare it. The company further said that Coronil will also help a user develop immunity against the respiratory disease and prescribed dosage too.This is when the government sprung into action. The ministry of Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy (AYUSH) ordered Patanjali to stop misleading advertisement of the product. It also said that results are still to be verified.Scientific methods talk about putting a potential drug through clinical trials to assess its efficacy. An Indian study indicates that hydroxychloroquine (derived from a tree), an inexpensive malaria medicine, is a prophylactic. A US study indicates that Gilead’s Remdesivir seems to work well on moderately ill Covid-19 patients if given early.A few studies on steroid dexamethasone also say that the steroid works well on critically ill Covid-19 patients who are on ventilator or oxygen support.Drugs like these need to follow the protocols set by India’s drug regulator, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), and the Union and state health ministries.The government has sought details from Patanjali like the composition of Coronil, the sites and hospitals where the research and study was conducted, sample size and other things.Patanjali’s CEO Acharya Balakrishna, meanwhile, said on Twitter that the Centre has been provided with all the necessary details of the clinical trials. He also claimed that 100 per cent parametres laid down for controlled trial of the Ayurvedic product have been followed.Patanjali said that it has partnered with privately-owned National Institute of Medical Science in Jaipur to make Coronil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-scientific-process-that-baba-ramdev-s-potential-covid-19-medicine-has-to-follow/story-hoISecbEFm8nxOvox3yF4L.html

24-06-2020||India||Diplomatic border talks to spell out steps to India-China disengagement||The crucial meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination on India-China border affairs (WMCC) will take place on Wednesday where the two sides are expected to have a candid conversation on how to resolve the stand-off at four points in East Ladakh.The Indian Army, after the marathon meeting of military commanders on June 22 had informally characterised it as “mutual consensus” to disengage but did not go deeper on whose terms. The Chinese spokesperson, in his stiff style, called the situation “cool” as if both the armies were hanging out with each other.While the marathon meeting is still being analysed, it is now emerging that both the generals forcefully put out claims of their respective armies along the 1,587 km Line of Actual Control (LAC) in East Ladakh.“There is consensus between both sides to mutually disengage after deliberating on each contested point. The process may take a couple of weeks as the ground commanders will have to verify the disengagement and the thinning out in the depth on a daily basis. It is true that both Chinese and Indian army did force accretion after the June 15 Galwan flare up. There has been no addition of forces since the June 22 military commanders’ meeting,” a senior military commander told Hindustan Times.Also Read: India deploys specialised mountain forces to check China’s LAC transgressionsThe fact is that the situation on the border continues to remain grim with both armies deployed and dug in till such time a clear-cut breakthrough is achieved. The Joint Secretary-level WMCC will now take the military dialogue further with the Indian side using maps, charts and old treaties to make the China counterpart understand how the People’s Liberation Army, or PLA, claim on the border is wrong and why the status quo ante must be restored for a strong bilateral relationship.“Till such time the PLA does not withdraw and restore status quo ante, it is an obfuscation exercise,” said a senior official, very concerned about how the entire dialogue was taking under public glare and pressure.It is quite evident from the tenor of the dialogue that both sides are holding positions on patrolling points 14, 15, 17 and Pangong Tso, waiting for the other side to blink. “It is a long haul, a battle of nerves. One has to be prepared for all contingencies and at no time lower the guard,” said an official.Also Read: India increases tech surveillance on Ladakh LAC with Israeli Heron dronesSince June 17, 2002, when the Chinese side backed out of exchanging western sector maps at the 12th meeting of the designated Expert Level Group, India is quite clear that Beijing does not want to settle the boundary on the western and eastern sector. Without exchanging the maps in 2002, India saw 12 areas of differences between the two countries in western sector. The PLA, under the instructions of the Central Military Commission, is all out to deepen the 12 differences by nibbling on the border through brazen might and force. Strategically also, it helps Chinese dictators to keep the border in ferment as it holds the potential to destabilise the democratic and multi-party India, where L 1 (lowest bidder) rules prevails and political competition is fierce.Despite being the paramount leader of an authoritarian communist regime, General Secretary Xi Jinping is under tremendous pressure with slow economic growth hitting Beijing as a manifestation of the failure of the politburo to control the coronavirus pandemic that spread from Wuhan. Rather than focus internally, the regime is firing from the hip at Japan, Australia, India, Taiwan, Hong Kong and US and by keeping the restive populations in Tibet and Xinjiang under iron hand to showcase Han supremacy.However, the Modi government has made it clear to Beijing that borders are non-negotiable from the very beginning. National Security Advisor Ajit Doval, who heads the bilateral Special Representative dialogue on boundary resolution, once told his Chinese counterpart during the meeting that just because his grandfather went to Mansarovar Lake from Garhwal without a visa, should India lay claim to western Tibet. At another time, when his counterpart wanted to bring Tawang in Arunachal Pradesh into the ambit of boundary talks, Doval told him that it is time they put an end to the dialogue as Tawang is not on the table.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/diplomatic-border-talks-today-to-spell-out-steps-to-india-china-disengagement/story-cwwnQn6StwwetmWLiJL2ZP.html
24-06-2020||India||Nadda criticises Congress for questioning govt’s stand on India-China relations||Bharatiya Janata Party president JP Nadda on Wednesday criticised the Congress for questioning the government’s stand on the standoff between Indian and Chinese border troops in Ladakh.In a series of tweets, Nadda lashed out at the Congress and said it is the opposition’s right to ask questions, and the all-party meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week saw healthy deliberations with several opposition leaders giving their valuable inputs. Nadda said while the opposition fully supported the Centre in determining the way ahead, some leaders had opted for a different path. “One family was an exception. Any guesses who?” he tweeted without giving names, though he appeared to be targeting the Gandhi family. The BJP and the Congress have engaged in verbal duels over the violent face-off between Indian and Chinese troops in Ladakh’s Galwan Valley on June 15, which led to the death of 20 Indian soldiers. The BJP-led NDA government has maintained there were no incursions and only transgressions across the LAC, the Congress has demanded to know why there is ambiguity in the government’s stance on what transpired along the Line of Actual Control (LAC). A day after the Congress at its Central Working Committee (CWC) meeting blamed the “Centre’s mismanagement” for a “full blown crisis on the borders with China”, Nadda retaliated by tweeting, “Due to the misadventures of one dynasty: we lost thousands of square kilometres of land. The Siachen glacier was almost gone. And much more. No wonder India has rejected them.”Nadda said a “rejected and ejected dynasty is NOT equal to the entire opposition. One dynasty’s interests are not India’s interests. Today, the nation is united and supportive of armed forces. This is the time for unity and solidarity.

A dynast throws tantrums and his courtiers peddle that fake narrative. Latest one relates to the the Opposition asking questions to the Government,” Nadda said in his first tweet.“It is the Opposition’s right to ask questions. The All Party Meeting saw healthy deliberations, with several Opposition leaders giving their valuable inputs. They also fully supported the Centre in determining the way ahead. One family was an exception. Any guesses who?” he further said.Nadda said that a “rejected and ejected dynasty is NOT equal to the entire Opposition”. “One dynasty’s interests are not India’s interests. Today, the nation is united and supportive of our armed forces. This is the time for unity and solidarity,” the BJP chief said in his third time. A rejected and ejected dynasty is NOT equal to the entire Opposition. One dynasty’s interests are not India’s interests. Today, the nation is united and supportive of our armed forces. This is the time for unity and solidarity. Relaunch of ‘the scion’ for the nth time can wait.He also took an indirect jibe at Rahul Gandhi saying the “relaunch of ‘the scion’ for the nth time can wait”.“Due to the misadventures of one dynasty: We lost thousands of square kilometers of our land. The Siachen glacier was almost gone. And much more. No wonder India has rejected them,” Nadda said in his final tweet on the issue. Due to the misadventures of one dynasty: We lost thousands of square kilometers of our land.The Siachen glacier was almost gone. And much more. No wonder India has rejected them. pic.twitter.com/QOGZH7WGNdThe war of words has been going on between the BJP and the Congress over the June 15 skirmish in the Ladakh region in which 20 Indian soldiers were killed. The Congress has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi, accusing him of giving away Indian territory to China. The attack has been led by Congress leader and party’s former president Rahul Gandhi.PM Modi had asserted at the all-party meeting that “no one has entered our territory, no one is at present within our territory and no one has occupied our posts”. This was in reference to the situation in the Galwan Valley after Indian Army’s brave action to thwart Chinese attempts to erect a structure on the Indian side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC).“Why did the PM tell the All-Party Meeting that “no one intruded into our territory”? Why did PMO delete these words from the official statement? And if ‘no one intruded into our territory’, how did our 20 soldiers die?” Congress leader Kapil Sibal asked on Tuesday.Nadda had earlier targeted the Congress party and former PM Manmohan Singh for their remarks on the Ladakh incident. He had said that they should stop insulting the security forces repeatedly and questioning their valour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rejected-and-ejected-dynasty-bjp-chief-nadda-sharpens-attack-on-congress-over-ladakh-face-off/story-xc6KFrQOscAu549uuXaRCJ.html

24-06-2020||India||From a gap of Rs 30 a litre to costing more than petrol: How diesel price surged||The price of diesel rose for 18th day in a row on Wednesday. With the current increase, diesel will now cost Rs 79.88 per litre in Delhi, while petrol price remained unchanged at Rs 79.76 a litre. This is the first time that diesel costs more than petrol in Delhi.The two fuels have seen a hike of Rs 10.49 per litre in the last 18 days.In January 2018, diesel retailed at Rs 61.74 a litre in Delhi. In about a year and a half, the price has gone up by mroe than Rs 18 per litre.In 2011, the difference was Rs 30 per litre.In June 2017, state-run fuel retailers Indian Oil, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum switched to daily price revision from a fortnightly pricing system. And since the dynamic fuel pricing system began, the gap between the prices of the two fuels has been narrowing.Higher levies imposed by the Centre and various state governments also contribute to the higher retail price of diesel.The increase in fuel rates started on June 7 this year as oil companies resumed daily revision in prices in line with costs after ending an 82-day gap during the Covid-19 lockdown. It has taken diesel prices to fresh highs and petrol price too is at a two-year high.People aware of the development said the fuel prices may soon cross the Rs 80 per litre mark soon as international oil prices continue to surge.The government has been facing Opposition’s ire over the daily increase in fuel prices. The Congress said on Tuesday that it will launch a ‘Jan Andolan’ (people’s movement) across the country soon against the hike.Discussing the issue at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee, the party condemned the hike in petrol and diesel prices and reminded the government of its “Raj Dharma”.The Trinamool Congress also slammed the Modi government at the Centre, saying it is “disgraceful to unleash a planned disaster” on the common people at a time when the country is in the throes of a pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/from-a-gap-of-rs-30-a-litre-to-costing-more-than-petrol-how-diesel-price-has-surged/story-VG22RMJiGEYxMimBBdBF5J.html

This will be the first time that PM Modi will be participating in a state-level event since the Covid-19 pandemic began.The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MNREGS) is going to be a major contributor assuring over 50 per cent of total jobs being created in Uttar Pradesh.“Uttar Pradesh has about 1.80 crore MNREGA job cardholders. Out of them, 85 lakh have been active. About 15 lakh new job cards have been added in the past few months and most of them are migrant labourers,” said Sanjay Dixit, former member of the Union government’s central employment guarantee council.Besides restoration of river, construction of rural roads, digging of ponds and pits for plantation drives and other such work is being carried out under the rural job scheme to provide work to people.“We are roping in all many major departments to provide work in addition to jobs being provided under the MNREGS. The micro small and medium enterprises (MSME) department, public works department, horticulture department and the agencies constructing the expressways will also contribute in a big way in creation of more jobs,” chief secretary RK Tiwari had said last week about the state government’s efforts in generating employment opportunities.Realtors’ body Naredco’s Uttar Pradesh wing will give employment to 1 lakh labourers belonging to the state at various real estate projects, the association said on Tuesday.Last month, the Naredco-UP signed an initial pact with the Uttar Pradesh government, offering to provide employment in their real estate projects to migrant labourers who have returned to the state.Meanwhile, former chief minister and Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav attacked Adityanath on the issue of providing one crore jobs to people of the state.“Chief Minister made claim of providing one crore job in a rally but someone go and ask people what they got in their bags,” Yadav said in a tweet in Hindi on Tuesday. ‘मुख्यमंत्री’ करोड़ों को रोज़गार का दावा कर गये रैली मेंपर जाकर जनता से पूछो भई क्या आया उसकी थैली मेंThe plan was set in motion after the arrival of migrant workers from various parts of the country to Uttar Pradesh during Covid-19 lockdown.

24-06-2020||India||Army builds bridge near Assam gas well fire site||Indian Army personnel have constructed a bridge near the burning natural gas well in Assam’s Tinsukia, which will help in extinguishing the flames.The 150 metre long Bailey bridge, constructed over a water body near the gas well of Oil India Limited (OIL) at Baghjan which had a blow out on May 27 and caught fire on June 9, will help deliver water needed to control the fire and plug the blowout.“Construction of the bridge is extremely critical for the task of controlling the fire as it provides the only access to the experts to approach the well. The experts now plan to lay a heavy-duty pipeline over the bridge to create a water umbrella for dousing the fire,” said an army release issued on Tuesday.According to Guwahati-based army spokesperson Lieutenant Colonel P Khongsai, construction of the bridge required the transportation of 233 metric tonnes of materials over a distance of 400km.“150 specially trained troops undertook the task under extremely risky and hazardous conditions in the vicinity of the raging fire with working temperatures exceeding 75 degree Celcius,” the release said.“Undaunted by the multitude of engineering challenges Army constructed the bridge in a short time of 24 hours on June 22 under heavy rainfall and extreme temperatures,” it added.According to OIL, the pipeline over the bridge will carry water from the nearby Dangori River to the well. A continuous and large volume of water is needed to control the fire and plug the blowout, uncontrolled release of gas and oil from a well when pressure systems fail.“Laying of water delivery line over Bailey bridge has been completed on Monday after whole night work at the site. Connections for sourcing water from Dangori River are underway,” said an OIL release on Monday.After the well caught fire, OIL had sought help from the army on June 14 for building the bridge. The entire exercise of controlling the fire and plugging the blow out is expected to be completed by the first week of July.The blowout on May 27 sparked an inferno that displaced thousands of people, spewed thousands of litres of oil and gas into the fragile ecosystem and wreaked havoc on the local wildlife.There are 17 oil wells and five gas wells in the Baghjan oil field, which generates 1,200 kilolitres of crude oil and 1.5 to 2 million metric standard cubic metres of gas per day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-builds-bridge-near-assam-gas-well-fire-site/story-meFWvoJ5FCyWg6aqZa27hP.html

24-06-2020||India||CBI summons former Manipur CM Ibobi in embezzlement case||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has summoned Okram Ibobi Singh for questioning on Wednesday in connection with its probe into alleged misappropriation of funds between 2009 and 2017 when he was the Manipur chief minister. The Congress called the summon a “desperate bid” to save the state’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government. Singh was summoned days after the Congress last week staked a claim to form the government in Manipur under his leadership after three BJP lawmakers resigned and six others withdrew their support to the state’s coalition government.Officials said a team of CBI’s Special Task Branch from New Delhi has arrived in Imphal to question Singh over the Manipur Development Society scam pertaining to alleged misappropriation Rs 332 crore.“It was alleged that the accused [Singh] while working as chairman of Manipur Development Society from June 30, 2009, to July 6, 2017, in conspiracy with others, misappropriated government funds to the tune of Rs 332 crore out of the total amount of Rs 518 crore which was entrusted to them for the purpose of executing development work,” a CBI statement said.The BJP-led government in Manipur filed two FIRs against Singh in September 2017 alleging irregularities. The CBI took over the cases from the state police and registered another FIR in November 2019. Three former chief secretaries DS Poonia, P C Lawmuknga and O Nabakishore are among other accused in the case. The Congress hit out at the BJP over the summon. “Desperate bid to save BJP government. Unlikely to save an unpopular leadership. This is nothing but an effort to buy time for a sinking ship. People will lose their faith in the CBI,” tweeted Gaurav Gogoi, a Congress MP.Gogoi and another Congress leader, Ajay Maken, were due to arrive in Imphal as their party seeks to form the government in the state. The Congress had asked governor Najma Heptullah to convene a special assembly session for a no-confidence motion against the government, whose strength in the 60-member assembly has been reduced to 18. Five MLAs from allied parties and an independent back the BJP.The BJP came to power in Manipur in 2017 even as Congress emerged as the single largest party with 28 seats. It secured 21 seats but formed the government with the support of allies.Congress has 20 lawmakers and with the support of smaller parties and an Independent legislator, the newly-formed Secular Progressive Front it leads has 26 legislators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-summons-former-manipur-cm-ibobi-in-embezzlement-case/story-CcZy0ZJzRgqQvtoim5jHEL.html
24-06-2020||India||Coal auctions may open up pristine forests for mining||The ongoing auction of 41 coal mines across the country would open up pristine and contiguous forests for mining in parts of central India, government documents show, even as the Union environment ministry has said decisions regarding auctioning were being taken on a case-by-case basis.The government was until 2015 considering declaring dense forests with hydrological value, and those near or overlapping streams and rivers as inviolate and hence no mining zones.Jairam Ramesh, the then Union environment minister, proposed go and no-go area classification for coal mining in 2009-10, and nine major coal blocks were studied for their biodiversity and forest cover. As many as 70% of the blocks were found to be suitable for mining while 30% were categorised as no-go areas. But the classification was never implemented following stiff resistance from steel, power and coal sectors.Ramesh’s successor, Jayanthi Natarajan, began an exercise for categorising inviolate forest areas in 2012. A group of ministers was constituted earlier in 2011 to consider environmental and developmental issues related to coal mining. It suggested all forests that cannot be regenerated to the desired capacity should be protected, according to a July 2012 report of the environment ministry.The report, a copy of which HT has seen, dealt with the formulation of parameters for the identification of inviolate forest areas. The parameters included forest type and cover, biological richness, wildlife value, landscape integrity, and hydrological value.The Forest Survey of India, Wildlife Institute of India, National Biodiversity Authority and National Tiger Conservation Authority were tasked with applying these parameters and to come up with a list of inviolate areas, according to the report.Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air director Nandikesh Sivalingam received a list of proposed inviolate areas under the Right To Information (RTI) Act from the environment ministry in 2015.The list showed that nearly 50% of the 825 current and future coal blocks met the inviolate area parameters. Sivalingam filed more queries under the RTIs, but did not receive any information on the implementation of the inviolate forest area policy.Fatehpur East, Morga II, Morga South (in Hasdeo Arand) in Chhattisgarh and Bandha in Madhya Pradesh are some of the 41 blocks being auctioned that were on the 2015 list of inviolate areas. A description of mines up for auction on Metal Scrap Trade Corporation (MSTC) website shows several of the mines do not have required forest clearance and are in the midst of protected forests.For instance, 19 sq km of Madanpur North’s 21 sq km area in Chhattisgarh is forested and several streams pass through it before joining the Hasdeo river. It awaits both forest and environmental clearance. Morga II has an area of 26.64 sq km, out of which 85% is in forest land. The area falls within the drainage of the Hasdeo, a major tributary of the Mahanadi river. Almost the entire Morga South coal block is spread over the forest land as per site description on the MSTC website.Environment ministry secretary RP Gupta said they have come out with parameters and decisions about the auction will depend on location, importance and nature of the projects.Officials cited the instance of Jharkhand’s Saranda Forest and said mining there was being restricted to a part of it after a study was conducted there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/coal-auctions-may-open-up-pristine-forests-for-mining/story-ErOjZZKsv1gr3KCD1rtnTM.html
24-06-2020||India||Delhiwale: His body, his house||He is standing motionless. His large eyes are gazing straight ahead, unblinking, as if penetrating into infinity. The middle-aged man in shirt and pyjamas is stationed by a pavement in a congested central Delhi market. It is very early in the morning and the shops are still shuttered.The man has huge bags hanging down from both his shoulders. The plastic sack lying by his side is of a basmati rice brand, printed with the illustration of an extravagantly dressed nobleman ensconced beside a mound of luscious biryani. “That’s also my samaan (belonging),” he mutters, nodding his head towards the rice sack—it is filled with something too, but not rice.A huge rat brazenly runs around the man’s feet and disappears into the adjacent drain. He shows no reaction.The man is supporting himself on a lathi, a walking stick. “Tooti taang (broken leg),” he explains, shaking his head. The lathi is wrapped in various layers of plastic, and the top is tied with padded pieces of various clothes. “So that it doesn’t hurt my hand to hold it for so long.... the plastic keeps the lathi free of gandagee (filth),” he says, gesturing absentmindedly towards a rain puddle.Introducing himself as Dherapad, the gentleman informs that he is “hoping that somebody will give me money for chai and breakfast.”That’s how he survives from one morning to another, he says, or rather murmurs, for he is talking in a low voice. It becomes impossible to discern his words, for instance, when he repeatedly gives the name of his native place.Showing the bags hanging from both his shoulders, he says they are packed with his clothes and bedding. “Mera sharir mera makaan hain (my body is my house)... wherever I go, my house goes with me.”Dherapad sleeps on the pavement, he says. He waves his arm casually in one direction, muttering, “One night I sleep in iss gali (this lane), another night I sleep in uss gali (that lane). My beds are everywhere.”It is difficult to describe his looks. He is wearing a mask. It isn’t the drab hospital-like face-wear other pedestrians are sporting. His bright coloured mask shows the popular animated character green Hulk, posing in all his anger and aggression. “Some unknown person gave it to me,” he shrugs.It appears that Dherapad is familiar to the people in the area. A few passersby acknowledge him with a friendly nod. And now an elderly man carrying a bundle of something hands it to Dherapad, requesting him to hold it while he shop around for mangoes. Dherapad wordlessly takes the bundle and holds it the way people with no experience of babies hold them when asked. The elderly man returns after a while, takes back the bag, taps cheerily on Dherapad’s shoulder out of gratitude and walks away.Across the road, a cat tiptoes under a vegetable cart and Dherapad follows her movement patiently.On being asked about his family, he says that “I am alone and I am enough for myself.” His mask slips down under his lips—he is smiling.As the morning lengthens, and the street gets crowded, Dherapad remains still, rooted to the same spot. The passersby go past him, barely noticing him. As if he were a market statue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhiwale-his-body-his-house/story-QjZQvz2eq8IHZFbV2nz2tN.html
24-06-2020||India||Covid-19: Trials for inhaled version of remdesivir to start in August||Gilead Sciences has said it will soon start clinical trials for inhaled formulation of its antiviral drug remdesivir used for the treatment of Covid-19. The US drugmaker said the trials will begin in August. “Remdesivir, our investigational antiviral medicine, is currently given to patients intravenously through daily infusions in the hospital,” Gilead Sciences said in a statement, adding that the inhaled formulation will be given through a nebulizer, which could potentially allow for easier administration outside the hospital at early stages of the disease.This could have significant implications in helping stem the tide of the pandemic, it said.“We have already learned a lot about how remdesivir works in a relatively short space of time. Remdesivir is now being used to treat patients through emergency use authorizations and other access programs around the world. And yet, we still have some way to go in exploring the full potential of remdesivir to help against Covid-19.”In the next wave of clinical development, the drug maker said it will study remdesivir in combination with other therapies and in additional patient groups. So far, randomised controlled trials of remdesivir have been evaluating safety and efficacy in hospitalised patients.In a study by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), it was found that remdesivir shortened recovery time by an average of four days and in the SIMPLE study of moderately ill patients--those in hospital but not requiring oxygen--individuals on a five-day course of remdesivir had better clinical outcomes than those receiving standard care.The NIAID study also showed that treatment was most effective in patients who did not require ventilator support, supporting further study in patients in early stages of the disease. The totality of these data shows that remdesivir has the potential to be of meaningful benefit to patients with Covid-19.“The inhaled formulation studies are one means of exploring the use of remdesivir in the earlier stages of Covid-19. We will also conduct trials using intravenous infusions in outpatient settings such as infusion centers and nursing homes,”’said Daniel O’Day, chairman and chief executive, Gilead Sciences.“Our hope is that earlier intervention could help patients avoid hospitalization,” he said.India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation on June 20 approved manufacturing and marketing of remdesivir by Hetero and Cipla.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trials-for-inhaled-version-of-remdesivir-to-start-in-august/story-49yDzjO3XmL8o44pJSp0HI.html

The state reported 2,710 Covid-19 cases and 37 deaths on Monday taking the total number of cases to 62,087 and death toll to 794. The number of active cases stands at 27,178.Meanwhile, a new quarantine strategy confining to homes an estimated 7-8 lakh people is expected to cut down chances of transmission of the coronavirus in Chennai, witnessing unabated spike in cases on a daily basis, according to a top official of the city civic body.Apart from the containment measures, the Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) was also ramping up capacity of the Covid Care centres, adding over 7,000 beds, its Commissioner G Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-declares-curbs-in-madurai-from-june-24-to-30/story-8FFrFIi7SEEOrHKllnf6UI.html
24-06-2020||India||India, China agree to pull back, reach ‘mutual consensus to disengage’||Indian and Chinese military commanders reached a “mutual consensus to disengage” from all “friction areas” along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), which has been tense since a brutal brawl on June 15 left 20 Indian troops dead in the Ladakh sector, two senior officials said on Tuesday.But the process of disengagement is likely to be “arduous and challenging”, and will require moving ahead cautiously in phases, people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The agreement was reached during an 11-hour meeting between top commanders at Moldo on the Chinese side of the LAC on Monday. The talks were aimed at cooling tensions and thinning the military build-up on both sides of the border. “The Corps Commander-level talks between India and China were held in a cordial, positive and constructive atmosphere,” one of the officials cited in the first instance said. “Modalities for disengagement from all friction areas in eastern Ladakh were discussed and will be taken forward by both the sides,” he added.While disengaging in some friction areas was a “low-hanging fruit” and could be achieved in a reasonable time-frame, the “real test” would lie in the restoration of status quo ante in the Finger Area where the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes and observation posts, said one of the persons cited in the second instance.China watchers believe that the disengagement process is likely to be less complicated in the Gogra Post-Hot Springs and the Galwan Valley sectors, where there are no real issues about the alignment of the LAC.The disengagement will have to be “equal, mutual and proportional,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations (DGMO).“The disengagement will be a long-drawn process because of the mistrust that has set in after the Galwan Valley clash. A lot of verification through different means will be required at every stage of disengagement to make sure that the PLA has retreated,” added Bhatia, who served as the army’s DGMO during 2013-14. The June 15 Galwan Valley skirmish in eastern Ladakh resulted in 20 deaths on the Indian side and the PLA suffered 43 casualties, according to Indian officials, but Beijing has not confirmed the fatalities. A Chinese spokesman on Tuesday dismissed such reports as “fake news”.Disengagement in the Finger Area on the north bank of Pangong Tso will be tricky in comparison with Gogra Post-Hot Springs and the Galwan Valley sectors where limited disengagement had begun after the first meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders on June 6, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).He was referring to the first meeting between delegations led by Lieutenant General Harinder Singh, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps, and Major General Liu Lin, commander of the South Xinjiang military region. During that meeting, the two sides reached an understanding to implement a de-escalation plan to ease rising tensions along the contested border, but tensions peaked in the aftermath of the June 15 skirmish. It was the first deadly conflict between Indian and Chinese soldiers along the LAC in 45 years.“The Finger area is where the real problem lies as the Chinese soldiers have dug in their heels there. It will be the most challenging part of the proposed disengagement,” said Hooda. The army is concerned about the PLA’s presence in the Finger Area, especially the Chinese activities between Finger 4 and Finger 8 over the last seven weeks. Chinese military positions in the Finger Area restrict the scope of the Indian Army patrolling areas that New Delhi considers its territory, according to a security official aware of the developments.He said the Indian Army would have to be extremely vigilant during the disengagement process, given what transpired in the Galwan Valley; the disengagement will have to be monitored by senior commanders to ensure things do not go awry; and a diplomatic dialogue will have to progress simultaneously.While the modalities for disengagement were discussed at the meeting between senior commanders, implementing the plan would require several rounds of talks between commanders on the ground, a second security official added.At the June 22 meeting between the corps commanders, India sought an assurance from the Chinese side on ending aggression along the border, and the thinning of Chinese military deployments in “depth areas” on their side of the disputed border. China had deployed up to 10,000 troops in these areas with the military buildup including fighter jets, helicopters, tanks, artillery guns, missile systems and air defence radars. India has matched the neighbour’s military moves. “Neither India nor China are likely to immediately thin their deployments in rear areas, given how volatile the disputed border has been,” the second security official added.Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday arrived in Leh, the headquarters of 14 Corps in Ladakh, on a two-day visit focused on conducting a security review of the sensitive sector. Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria made a low-key visit to Ladakh last week to review the Indian Air Force’s preparedness in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-agree-to-pull-back/story-opEPbVrWjWTlBv0aqDFxeL.html
24-06-2020||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Some time back, one of my editors and I went back and forth on a story about a Good Samaritan who had apparently saved hundreds of lives by ensuring that people bitten by snakes got a homeopathic antidote on time.I’m a believer when it comes to matters of faith, but I’m otherwise a rationalist — which means I do not believe in homeopathy. There are millions of people who believe in it, and more power to them, but the newsroom is a place where data and science (not belief) must guide decisions.But many of the people were saved, the editor argued.I knew the counter to this because I know a little about snakes.That’s because the bite may have been what is called a “dry bite” (one where no venom is injected), or a “partial bite” (where a little venom is), or the snake itself may have been non-venomous (which is often the case), I remember explaining.It’s this combination of circumstances that’s probably kept in business generations of herbalists offering traditional antidotes to snake venom — and more power to these herbalists too. Caveat Emptor and all that.I thought it was a good time to share the snakebite story because there seems to be a belief in some quarters that a miracle cure for Covid-19 is waiting to be discovered.It may be, but the chances of one existing are low, and the probability that, if it exists, it will be found, even lower. I say this despite knowing that Oseltamivir (which many of us know better as Tamiflu), used to treat many kinds of flu, was originally derived from shikimic acid, which itself was derived from the Chinese star anise (Illicium verma), which has been around forever.And so, speaking of snakes, all of us must guard against snake oil merchants proffering miracle cures for Covid-19.This is what we know: there are many existing drugs whose efficacy, when it comes to treating Covid-19, is the subject of clinical trials around the world. An Indian study indicates that hydroxychloroquine (also derived from a tree), an inexpensive malaria medicine, is a prophylactic. A US study indicates that Gilead’s Remdesivir seems to work well on moderately ill Covid-19 patients if given early. And a British study indicates that the steroid dexamethasone works well on critically ill Covid-19 patients who are on ventilator or oxygen support (when given late) (see page 5).This is what science tells us and this is what we must believe, all of us.Governments, medical research organisations, drug controllers, everyone has a duty to see that we do — and facilitate this belief in science by coming down hard on anything that isn’t science (or worse still, is pseudo-science).This doesn’t always happen; even in the midst of the current Covid-19 crisis, some Indian state governments have been disingenuous, equating Ayurvedic medicines that boost general immunity with Covid-19 cures. There is no Ayurvedic medicine for Covid-19; at least, not yet.India’s drug regulator, Drug Controller General of India, the Indian Council of Medical Research, and the Union and state health ministries must ensure that no one pitches a cure for Covid-19 without going through due scientific process. In a country of believers, the consequences of allowing a company or an individual to launch a miracle cure for Covid-19 that hasn’t been scientifically tested would be disastrous.India is a country that believes in home remedies. Many work (and work well), obviating the need for allopathic intervention that, apart from being expensive, could also take its toll on the body. But Covid-19 isn’t going to be cured by home remedies.We should all believe that.P.S.: I’d be delighted if someone were to discover a home remedy for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-19-what-you-need-to-know-today/story-gBedb3hZVCbV4UbLOK5PEP.html
24-06-2020||India||Severe chaos over mild patients after new SOP||The old system of assessing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients at their residence to determine if they are fit for home isolation must be brought back, the Delhi government said in a letter to Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal on Tuesday, reiterating the practical difficulties in a new protocol that senior as well as grassroots health staff separately said was virtually impossible to implement. The administration on Monday formalised the new health assessments protocol that says every new Covid-19 patient must visit a government facility, a process that requires special ambulances and increased deployment of medical staff, and raises the risk of infection among anyone who is involved in the exercise. “There is a lot of panic among people because of the new guidelines. Earlier, they tried to stop home isolation and a consensus on continuing it was reached after a lot of dialogue. Now, [there is] this new guideline… Why should a Covid-19 patient be made to stand in a queue at a quarantine centre? I have written to the L-G to continue with the earlier system of the medical team visiting the home of coronavirus patients instead,” said Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia at a press briefing.On Tuesday, Delhi recorded its largest single-day spike of Covid-19 cases so far with 3,947 people testing positive. While at least some of these were possibly through antigen tests at a health facility, a large proportion are likely to have been identified through RT-PCR tests carried out by labs. These results usually come a day or more later, and it is these people who need to be taken to a facility, according to the rule put into force on Monday.The guidelines were first suggested by the L-G-led Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) over the weekend. According to these rules, a doctor at a Covid-19 Care Centre (CCC) will check severity of symptoms of each patient and, from health history of any comorbid condition, determine if they can be allowed to recover at home. A separate team will carry out house checks to see whether there is a stand-alone room and bathroom that a Covid-19 patient needs for home isolation so that other members of the family are not infected. The new rules led to such chaos that at least three of the 11 districts of Delhi have not been able to adopt the protocol since they have too many new cases to handle, officials from these districts told HT on Tuesday on the condition of anonymity. “Currently, around 3,000 people on an average are testing Covid-19 positive in Delhi per day through swab tests. If they have to be taken to CCCs, the government will have to arrange 3,000 trips of ambulances in addition to the distress calls that they are presently catering to. This seems impossible at this juncture. So, we have no alternatives but to continue with the old method for now until further orders are received,” said one of the three district magistrates, asking not to be named. Delhi has 163 ambulances on special “corona duty” that requires its staff to be in full personal protective equipment (PPE) and follow special sanitisation procedures. Given the strength of the fleet, each ambulance will need to carry out more than 18 trips in 24 hours if all of these patients are to be taken to these centres as per protocol.“Coronavirus patients will have to go to the quarantine centres and stand in long queues, which will aggravate their illness and pass it on to others. How will they reach the centres? Ambulances should be kept for taking severe patients to hospitals rather than transporting people with mild symptoms to these centres,” said Sisodia. “I am hopeful that the L-G will soon call a meeting of the state disaster management authority to change this decision and resolve the problems of the patient,” he added.The LG’s office did not respond to requests for a comment on Sisodia’s letter.The letter follows a protracted row between the L-G’s office and the Delhi government, triggered by an order on Friday that virtually scrapped the practice of home isolation. The order was reversed a day later, but the DDMA – the nodal agency for Covid-19 response measures that is led by the L-G – introduced the mandatory assessments.A second area of confrontation was on the choice of an agency that is meant to carry out followup checks with people in home isolation. The Friday order scrapped the arrangement with Portea Medical and, according to Monday’s guidelines, the task can now involve medical students or be outsourced. Officials said the process of outsourcing will require new tendering.The tussle has led to a situation where many patients were moved to CCCs and are not requesting to be allowed to go back. “I feel weak and breathless. I thought I’d be kept under observation. But the doctor only checks up on me over the phone. The facility is good, but I think I would have taken better care of myself at home, as there is no special medical treatment for this,” said 35-year-old Anita from the Terapanth Bhawan CCC in Chattarpur.A majority of the CCCs lack air conditioning and some – particularly the ones setup in schools – require residents to use common lavatories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/severe-chaos-over-mild-patients-after-new-sop/story-Cw5dkrQ2DHwrAA9bswv8gP.html
24-06-2020||India||A transformed MGNREGS is an effective tool to tackle rural distress | Opinion||As our country goes through one of the toughest crises, it is expected that there would be political consensus, not political mudslinging, around our response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Right from upgrading hospital infrastructure, developing emergency beds and ICUs to economic measures. It was interesting to see Abhishek Manu Singhvi, in a recent newspaper article, taking umbrage at PM Modi’s ‘monumental failure’ expression for MGNREGS in 2014. However, the entire discourse, carried on by many opposition leaders, amounts to ‘missing the wood for the trees’. The recent announcement of an additional Rs 40,000 crore under MGNREGS to mitigate rural distress could not have come at a more appropriate time. This has further been supplemented by the “PM Garib Kalyan Rozgar Yojna” that aims at providing Rs 50,000 crore worth of work to 69 lakh migrant workers in 116 districts. While the naysayers are recollecting PM Modi’s description of MGNREGS as ‘monumental failure’, they intentionally forget to mention the context in which such a statement was made. Prior to May 2014, a series of objections raised by the Comptroller and Auditor General, PILs filed before the Supreme Court, a plethora of circulars issued by the Ministry of Rural Development - many of the circulars contradicting the ones issued earlier - frequent interference of the then National Advisory Council in policy making and implementation and lack of proper monitoring and transparency had led to tremendous chaos and confusion in the field. Consequently, there was rampant corruption and a large number of earthworks, which would facilitate such corruption, became the order of the day. PM Modi’s statement regarding ‘monumental failure’ was basically intended to highlight the urgent need to transform MGNREGS with a focus on transparency, durable asset creation and convergence of MGNREGS with other schemes to maximize the impact.Having been directly associated with the entire transformation exercise taken up under MGNREGS, I would like to list out some of the major governance reforms that ensured a complete overhaul of the programme. If MGNREGS has been able to stand by the poor and the deprived in the villages today, it is due to a series of painstaking reforms that were ushered in pursuant to PM Modi’s directions.In the midst of the chaos and confusion prevailing in MGNREGS implementation in the UPA-2 regime, a major intervention for removing the possibility of ‘ghost assets’ and repeat works on the same site was geo-tagging of all assets created since April, 2014. With the help of space technology and tie up with National Remote Sensing Centre, ISRO, Hyderabad, the MORD, with support from states, geo-tagged nearly 4 crore assets within a short period and the effort continues. This was a path-breaking initiative which was emulated in many central government schemes at a later date.Coupled with this, came the National Electronic Fund Management System (e-FMS) on 1 January 2015. While Dr Singhvi is right that the DBT announcement had been made in the 2013 budget, he conveniently chose not to mention the extremely poor implementation of all DBT announcements by the UPA-2 Government. Because of strong monitoring and guidance of the Prime Minister, 99% of the MGNREGA funds are being transferred directly to the bank account of the beneficiaries today. Holding on to Aadhaar database, without making effective use was one more glaring example of the policy paralysis afflicting the system in UPA-2 days.In sharp contrast to the earlier focus on taking up any kind of earthwork in the name of addressing rural unemployment, there was a conscious effort after 2014 to move towards durable asset creation and taking up more individual land based activities to enable small and marginal farmers to gain long term benefits through MGNREGS interventions. For example, only 3,488 works were taken up under the rural infrastructure component of MGNREGS in the financial year 2013-14. This shot up to 2,52,628 in 2019-20. Works on individual land go a long way in augmenting the income of a household and they ensure more tangible asset creation due to personal involvement of the landowner or the small and marginal farmer. A massive push was given to such works and consequently, this figure jumped from 18 lakh individual works in 2013-14 to 1.42 crore works in 2019-20.Dr Singhvi’s overenthusiastic suggestion to increase the number of mandays from 100 days to 200 days misses the fact that the law itself provides for adding 50 more mandays only to the existing 100 days. That too is permissible only in the event of drought or other natural calamities. The cynics must note that the Labour Budget of MGNREGS has been increasing with focus on poor and needy states like Odisha, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand and Bihar. The Labour Budget of 2014-15 and 2020-21 are 220 crore and 281 crore mandays respectively. That means more resources are made available for which PM Modi and team deserve accolades; this is another dimension of the transformative approach adopted by the central government.To maximize the impact of MGNREGS interventions, works under convergence have increased immensely in recent years. Convergence has helped in combining necessary resources for generating an asset. Increased demand from beneficiaries from all the states for convergence works has further cemented the utility of this initiative. This thrust of the government on convergence has resulted in creation of useful and durable assets - anganwadi centres, food storage godowns, variety of roads including those with paver blocks as well as plastic waste and water conservation structures. While 66,525 works were taken up under the ‘convergence’ category in 2014-15, this number has gone up to 4,51,779 in 2019-20.That Dr Singhvi has not checked facts before putting in certain figures mesmerizes many of us keeping in view his level of wisdom. His allegation that Rs 16,000 crore is outstanding is divorced from reality. In April 2020 itself, all pending dues have been cleared, thanks to the proactive approach of the central government.Times like these require a proper appreciation of the gravity of the situation and a constructive approach to overcome the present crisis which is staring at us. Statements of Dr Singhvi and other opposition leaders at this critical juncture smack of cynicism and apathy. PM Modi is leading from the front. His clarion call for constructing an Atma Nirbhar Bharat requires all of us, from all segments, to join hands for various nation-building activities with hearts full of compassion, empathy and hope.(A former IAS officer, Aparajita Sarangi is a BJP Member of Parliament from Odisha’s Bhubaneswar constituency.

24-06-2020||India||India pledges $10 million for UN agency working for Palestinian refugees||India on Tuesday announced it will contribute $10 million over the next two years to a key UN agency working for Palestinian refugees as part of efforts to ensure sustainable and predictable funding for the body.Minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan announced India’s contribution for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) while participating in an extraordinary virtual ministerial pledging conference convened by Jordan and Sweden.UNRWA needs continued support since “sustainability and predictability of funding is imperative for any agency or organisation to carry on its mandate without interruption”, he said.“When certain countries withdrew funding, we had stepped up our annual pledge from $1.25 million to $5 million in 2018. For this year, we have already disbursed $2 million and will soon be remitting the balance $3 million. I am pleased to announce that we will contribute another $10 million to UNRWA over the coming two years,” Muraleedharan said.Describing India as a “steadfast supporter of the Palestinian cause”, he said capacity enhancement through training and building durable institutions is a major plank of New Delhi’s developmental assistance.India is working with the Palestinian side to organise more training programmes on virtual platforms amid the Covid-19 pandemic and is committed to timely disbursement of funds so that developmental projects continue on schedule, he said.“We provide 250 annual scholarships to Palestinian youth and officials, apart from regular customised training programmes, and our current project grant is around $72 million,” Muraleedharan said.As the pandemic continues to wreak havoc around the world and stretch governments’ resources to address healthcare and socio-economic needs, India is assisting countries in need of critical life-saving drugs despite a surge in domestic demand for medical supplies, he said. “We are sending a medical shipment to Palestine next week,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-pledges-10-million-for-un-agency-working-for-palestinian-refugees/story-wRMMw5kz1QgrrAldvv23EJ.html
24-06-2020||India||Not just defence modernisation, India needs to step up economic development | Opinion||There are no permanent friends or enemies in international relations, only self-interest determines the scope of relationships. History is witness to numerous instances when countries ignored this dictum and were shocked beyond belief to find their best friends betraying their trust to further their own self-interest. It is China today but there was another country yesterday. This is how it goes. It is not a surprise that they betrayed, the surprise is that they were trusted. So every country should keep their eyes and ears open, remain vigilant, watch closely actions of others, look at their-self interest, assess their own actions and policies as perceived by others and then determine the depth or otherwise of a relationship.The annexation of Tibet, asylum to Dalai Lama, establishment of Tibet’s government-in-exile in Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh, then the 1962 war and consequential loss of India’s territory are still fresh in our nation’s mind . Further, China has been periodically raising disputes along the Line of Actual Control, which still remains largely unmarked, leading to several skirmishes in the past. Only three years back, the Doklam stand-off lasted for more than 70 days and a lot of energy, time and effort was expended by the Indian side to bring the issue to a closeChina has been consistently opposing India’s entry in the Nuclear Suppliers Group, tried to raise the Kashmir issue repeatedly at the UN and openly helped Pakistan block the UN Security Council from classifying terrorist group Jaish-e-Mohammad chief Masood Azhar for as long as it could. Not only that , construction of road in Aksai Chin area, which passes through Pakistan occupied Kashmir, was carried out despite strong opposition by India.In today’s world , no two nuclear-armed countries can afford to go to war with each other. That is a given. In this scenario, protecting the national boundaries from encroachment by others is the most pragmatic approach. Certainly this requires constant vigil at the border, proper force deployment and round-the-clock intelligence gathering through the year.As for the present stand off, the orders given by the Prime Minister to our armed forces to take all necessary steps to ensure that Chinese forces do not cross the Line of Actual Control at any cost is a step in the right direction. Freedom of action to achieve a defined goal is the key to success in any kind of situation, particularly when it comes to protecting our national boundaries. That being done, now it is up to the leadership of the armed forces to ensure that our boundaries are protected at all costs come what may. Political authorisation is there, now the action to implement the decision lies with them. Naturally during such times the entire country stands by our brave forces who are second to none.The world’s history has only one lesson to offer. That there is no place for the weak in history, they have to perish. Only those who are prepared for all eventualities survive, and those who depend on the benevolence and goodwill of others will perish. This is how human civilization has behaved during the past nearly three thousand years of recorded history, and it is not going to change its character any sooner. To ensure that our country is not made to suffer any embarrassing situations, we have to prepare ourselves to such a level that others do not even dare to think about such mischievous acts. That will not only require building a stronger, modern, better equipped and commensurate armed force but also to transform our country into an economic powerhouse, a prosperous and poverty-free country. Our people certainly deserve it more than others.(VS Pandey is a former IAS officer.

24-06-2020||India||Govt mismanaging border situation: Sonia Gandhi at CWC meeting||Accusing the government of engaging in “denials, disinformation and diversions” on Chinese “intrusions” in Indian territory and mismanaging the matter, and alleging that Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s statement on the issue stood in contradiction to the positions of the ministry of defence and external affairs, the Congress has asked the government about steps being taken to ensure the restoration of status quo ante at the border. At a virtual meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), the party also strongly critiqued the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic — and said it had “abandoned” its responsibilities and had not unveiled a “coherent strategy”, even as the infection curve was rising “exponentially”. The main national opposition also accused the government of “profiteering” by “fleecing” citizens with the repeated increases in petrol and diesel prices. The meeting, chaired by party president Sonia Gandhi, was attended by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, former party chief Rahul Gandhi, all Congress chief ministers and senior leaders. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has rebutted the Congress’s criticism, and claimed that it was deriving “sadistic pleasure” from the India-China stand-off. In her opening remarks, Sonia Gandhi said, “It is said ‘misfortunes do not come singly’. India has been hit by a terrible economic crisis, a pandemic of huge proportions and, now, by a full-blown crisis on the borders with China. Much of each crisis is attributable to the mismanagement of the BJP-led NDA government and the wrong policies pursued by it.” She added that the cumulative effect was “widespread misery, fear, and danger to the security and territorial integrity of the country”. On the PM’s statement On China, the Congress president, while hoping for mature diplomacy and decisive leadership in protecting India’s territorial integrity, critiqued the PM for his statement on Friday that there was no (external) presence in Indian territory. The Prime Minister’s Office subsequently clarified that his remark pertained to the situation in the Galwan Valley, where 20 personnel of the Indian army were killed in clashed on June 15.Rahul Gandhi too critiqued the government on its China policy. He claimed that China had “brazenly” occupied Indian territory and accused the PM of destroying “our position” and betraying the army by accepting China’s position. “The Chinese can’t be permitted to get away with this unacceptable usurpation of our land.” He claimed that the PM had demolished the “institutional structure of Indian diplomacy”. Former PM Manmohan Singh told the CWC that the crisis on the border, which if not tackled firmly, can lead to a “serious” situation.A formal CWC resolution said, “The Prime Minister’s statement has had far reaching implications. He cannot allow his words to be used by the Chinese as a vindication of their position, when it is clear that the brazen transgressions into our territory were committed by them.” It added that for China to make “audacious claims” over Indian territory, including Galwan Valley, by resorting to “unilateral and unprovoked acts of transgression and incursion” could not be tolerated or accepted.The BJP hit back at the Congress for deriving “sadistic pleasure” from the ongoing India-China stand-off. “India has not surrendered an inch of its land, but the Congress has surrendered it shame,” BJP spokesperson Sambit Patra said.“Why is the Congress deriving sadistic pleasure by showing that India is not performing well? It is not only worrying, but also indicates a conspiracy,” he said, claiming that the stand-off with China was a “legacy issue”.On the timing of the Congress’ critique, Sanjay Kumar, political analyst at the Centre for Study of Developing Societies (CSDS) said that both political parties had politicised the issue of national security. “I don’t consider it right that Congress is asking questions of government on China but this culture was started by BJP when it was in opposition. It didn’t start in last 6-7 days. There has been a deterioration in politics. We saw it in campaign and now in governance. Congress is also fighting its game for survival and they are looking for some opportunity to corner the BJP.”On Covid-19 management The Congress also put forth a detailed critique of the government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic. While lauding Corona warriors, the party said it was “astonishing” that the government had not unveiled a “coherent strategy” on “reducing fatalities, increasing testing, contact tracing and ensuring social distancing and safety for the most vulnerable population”. It alleged that there was no nationwide data on hospital beds and ventilators and that the PM-Cares fund was “severely under-utilised” and managed without transparency.The party demanded that the government cap prices of treatment in private hospitals, ensure price control and easy availability of drugs, and impose penalties on defaulting insurance companies. Sonia Gandhi said within weeks of the coronavirus lockdown, it was apparent that the government was totally unprepared to manage its fallout. “The result was the greatest humanitarian crisis witnessed since 1947-48. Millions of migrant workers, daily wage earners and self-employed were devastated. 130 million jobs are estimated to have been lost. Crores of MSMEs have been shut, perhaps forever,” Gandhi claimed. She added that a sliding economy is now hurtling toward a recession for the first time in 42 years. “I am afraid there will be high unemployment, falling incomes and wages, and lower investment.”The BJP dismissed the criticism on the governments management of the pandemic. Patra said, “It is unfortunate that the Congress is doing politics of misfortune. India is capable to fight ‘C’ for Corona, ‘C’ for China and of course ‘C’ for conspiracies of Congress as well. We can fight all this and let me assure you India will emerge victorious of all the misfortunes that Sonia Gandhi was talking about.”On fuel pricesThe Congress also raised the issue of the fuel price hike, with the party president saying that the government had added “insult to injury by mercilessly” raising petrol and diesel prices for 17 consecutive days, at a time when world prices of crude have fallen. In a resolution, the CWC said this unjustly enriched the government at the cost of people “struggling with rising unemployment, deep income shortfalls and significant salary cuts”. It demanded a rollback of the hike and passing the benefit of low oil prices directly to citizens. The Congress is planning a nationwide agitation on the issue after oil companies on Tuesday hiked auto fuel rates for the 17th day in a row by 20 paise a litre and 55 paise respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-mismanaging-border-situation-sonia-at-cwc-meeting/story-pQmM2N2SBt49FQjuku8kJI.html
24-06-2020||India||H-1B visa holders anxious after decision||Vikram Desai, an information technology (IT) professional on an H-1B visa cleared for a Green Card, says that when he and his wife first heard of President Donald Trump’s order suspending work visas, they panicked.“We have parents in the high-risk category of those vulnerable to Covid-19 and our first thoughts were that if one of us had to leave the US for India ,we may not be able to return until the end of the year,” he said. His H-1B visa has expired and he is on extension, which is being granted easily by US authorities in view of the Covid-19 restrictions and lockdowns. But if he or his wife were to travel to India or anywhere out of the US, they will be unable to return without getting their passports stamped with renewed visas.That was already a problem with consular operations closed at US missions, and now with the suspension until the end of the year, it’s even worse.“It feels just safer to stay in the US,” Desai said, adding, “things are so uncertain at this time.”Many Indians on H-1B or in line for Green Cards are stranded in India already because of the suspension of commercial flights. They have begun to make their way back, slowly.“This is a Hindu Ban much like the Muslim Ban,” said one of those impacted by the suspension, referring to the controversial ban imposed on the entry of people from some Muslim majority countries by Trump early on in his presidency, which remains in force, in a version diluted by legal challenges.This person may have actually meant an “India ban”, not a Hindu ban, because Indians, irrespective of their religion, have been the largest beneficiaries of the suspended H-1Bs and H-4 visas, which are given to spouses of H-1B visa-holders cleared for the Green Card. It allows the spouses to work.Indians are the largest beneficiaries of both H-1Bs (more than 70% of the annual 85,000) and H-4 (for spouses and unmarried children). Indians accounted for 93% of the 126,853 H-4 EAD (employment authorization document) applications approved till December 2017, according to a study by the Congressional Research Service, a non-partisan provider of data and analysis to US congress, based on numbers from the USCIS.This is because the queue for Green Cards is the longest for Indians; current waiting time is statistically estimated to be over 100 years. H-4 was introduced by President Barack Obama in 2015 as an incentive for these Green Card hopefuls. The Trump administration wants to rescind it.Pramila Jayapal, the Indian American congresswoman who led a joint appeal by lawmakers to the administration to not cancel H-4, slammed Trump’s new order in a post on Twitter: “For months, Trump has been desperately trying to do anything to open the country back up and return to ‘normal’. EXCEPT for those who are immigrants seeking to contribute to this country,” she wrote, and added, “We must defeat Trump’s racist and white nationalist agenda.”But for some IT services companies that use H-1Bs to hire workers from India, or elsewhere, the Monday order was “not as bad as feared”.“I breathed a sigh of relief,,” said Deepali Khadakban, owner of New Jersey-based Precision Technologies. Based on news reports and speculation, the company expected a hike in H-1B visa processing fee, which is paid by the employer, a change in the qualification for H-1B, and an end of work authorization for graduates as part of their course.As of now, the suspension will only push the joining date for new hires coming from India, from October, the usual starting time, by a few months to December.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/h-1b-visa-holders-anxious-after-decision/story-Ttw3WFBBEqcvjAt3X4uxlN.html
24-06-2020||India||China road projects changed course of rivers, expanded its territory: Nepal govt document||Massive road development projects in the Tibet Autonomous Region have resulted in rivers changing course and expanding China’s boundary into the northern territories of Nepal, according to a document from Nepal’s agriculture department.The document, accessed by Hindustan Times, said patches of Nepalese territory in several districts had been encroached on by China, and it cautioned Beijing could take over more territory in the north if the rivers continue to change course. The loss of Nepalese territory due to rivers changing course could run into “hundreds of hectares”, it said.“There is a high possibility that over the period of time, China may develop its Border Observation Post of Armed Police in those territories,” the document from the agriculture ministry’s survey department said.Nepal, which shares a boundary with China in the north, has 43 hills and mountains, from east to west, that act as the natural boundary between the two countries. The two sides have six check posts, essentially for trade.The survey department assessed that the changing course of 11 rivers had already cost Nepal 36 hectares, or 0.36 sq km, across the four districts of Humla, Rasuwa, Sindhupal chowk and Sankhuwasabha.The encroachment of 36 hectares by China was first reported to the KP Sharma Oli government last year.There were street protests after the loss of Nepalese territory to China emerged in the local media but the government, accused by Oli’s detractors of attempting to cosy up to China’s communist party, played down the encroachment by the Chinese and channelled the public outrage against India over new maps issued by New Delhi last November after the erstwhile state of Jammu and Kashmir was split into two union territories.Oli went on to ramp up differences with India over Kalapani, Limpiyadhura and Lipulekh, spread over 330 sq km, in May after Chinese intervention helped him survive a rebellion within his party the previous month. That intervention, however, meant he had to scrap two ordinances promulgated just five days earlier.Oli seized the opportunity after defence minister Rajnath Singh opened an 80-km road that ends at Lipulekh pass on the border with Tibet.Analysts in New Delhi and Kathmandu believe Oli’s hard push for Nepal’s new political map was an effort to whip up ultra-nationalistic sentiments targeting India to consolidate his position in the government and the party. This is why, a diplomat in New Delhi said, didn’t inform Parliament before it voted on the map earlier this month that he had ignored an offer of dialogue between the foreign secretaries of the two countries.Instead, he gave parliamentarians the impression his government was forced to push the envelope since New Delhi had declined his offer for dialogue.New Delhi hardened its position after the map was cleared by Nepal’s Parliament this month, asserting it was for him to create a conducive atmosphere in case he is interested in bilateral dialogue on the boundary issue.Nepalese officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, questioned the veracity of the survey showing loss of land to the Chinese side and said such matters are handled by the survey department under the ministry of land reform and management.“Nepal and China have an agreed boundary and established protocols. The border has been completely mapped and there are pillars and established mechanisms for dealing with any issue that may arise,” said one of the people cited above.“There are also periodic inspections between the two sides and any issues that could crop up on the ground are dealt with by the two sides,” the person added.The officials acknowledged that Nepal and India are yet to reach a similar stage in their handling of the border, which is yet to be completely mapped.The Indian side said earlier this month that almost 98% of the 1,750-km land and riverine border between India and Nepal has been delineated and differences remain only in Kalapani sector in Uttarakhand and Susta sector in Bihar. ...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-road-projects-changed-course-of-rivers-expanded-its-territory-nepal-govt-document/story-NGEiAQc25H1oIcCXEgu4GI.html
24-06-2020||India||Lessons from 2014 standoff in focus as commanders agree to disengage||The disengagement process during a previous border standoff in the Ladakh involved a temporary ban on Indian and Chinese soldiers patrolling disputed areas along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), people familiar with that border dispute said on Tuesday.The three-week tense confrontation in Ladakh’s Chumar sector in 2014 may have lacked the aggression that has been witnessed during the current round of border tensions but it was a serious development as dominating the area where the standoff took place.The “mutual consensus to disengage from friction areas” along the LAC, reached during a marathon meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders , has turned the spotlight on how disengagement works.More than 1,000 troops Indian troops were eyeball to eyeball with an equal number of Chinese soldiers at the height of the Chumar standoff. “The soldiers from the two armies were barely five metres apart. When our helicopters dropped chocolates for our soldiers, the Chinese troops would also get some of the goodies. That’s how close they were,” said Lieutenant General (retd) DS Hooda, who was the Northern Army commander during the Chumar standoff.The final disengagement between the troops involved two steps, Hooda said. “After the modalities for disengagement were worked out, we were successful in getting the Chinese to retreat to their camp in Chepzi, which was five km away. We moved back to our camp. It wasn’t that complicated as there had been hardly any aggression from either side. In the second step, both sides agreed to a moratorium on patrolling disputed areas to avoid face-offs,” Hooda said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/lessons-from-2014-standoff-in-focus-as-commanders-agree-to-disengage/story-9OQKTIpDBeJAkyaNTngAZO.html
24-06-2020||India||Largest beneficiary, India to be hit hard by overhaul||President Donald Trump on Monday extended the suspension of Green Cards till the end of the year and expanded it to cover non-immigrant work visas such as H-1B that go mostly to Indian professionals hired by both American companies such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon, and Indian IT services giants such as TCS, Wipro and Infosys. The president has also directed officials to separately overhaul the H-1B programme through a regulation at a later date to turn it merit-based by prioritizing highest paid applicants.Indians will be disproportionately impacted on both counts as the largest beneficiaries of the H-1B programme accounting for more than 70% of the 85,000 visas issued annually. Senior Trump administration officials said the suspended work visas included H-1B (H-4 is for spouses and unmarried children of H-1B visa-holders, and some of them with H-4 EAD are allowed to work, not all), H-2B for low skill workers, some categories of J visas for cultural and education workers and L-1 for intra-company transfers. They were intended to ensure Americans had the first shot at jobs in the aftermath of record job losses caused by Covid-19 related lockdowns, and are expected to free up 525,000 jobs.Opposition from the industry came swiftly. “Immigration has contributed immensely to America’s economic success, making it a global leader in tech, and also Google the company it is today,” Sundar Pichai, the head of Google and an immigrant from India, wrote on Twitter. He added: ’“Disappointed by today’s proclamation — we’ll continue to stand with immigrants and work to expand opportunity for all.”Amazon, which received more H-1Bs than any other company. in 2019, also slammed the Trump order. ““Preventing high skilled professionals from entering the country and contributing to America’s economic recovery puts American’s global competitiveness at risk,” the company said.For those at the receiving end of the order, it was frightening. Vikram Desai, an IT professional cleared for a Green Card, said he and his wife had looked at each other with dread when they first heard of the suspension order. “We have parents in the high-risk category of those vulnerable to Covid-19 and our first thoughts were that if one of us had to leave the US for India, we may not be able to return until the end of the year,” he said.Hundreds of Indians on H-1B or those approved for Green Cards have already been living away from their family or spouse for months now, stranded in India because of travel restrictions in force on either side, compounded by the closure of consular operations at US missions.Political observers linked the suspensions to Trump’s desire to seal the support of his base ahead of his re-election bid in November. Some conservatives have long viewed the work visa programmes, specially H-1B, as a threat for Americans, and Trump is tapping into it with these suspensions.Activists campaigning for a better deal for Indian H-1B visa holders in line for Green Card say an estimated 2 million Indians will be impacted by the suspensions, including H-1B visa holders, those waiting for their Green Cards and those on L-1. They claimed these were conservative estimates.Chinese are the second largest beneficiaries of these programmes, but they are already on notice from the Trump administration because of the coronavirus disease (which originated in China) .Equally significant with lasting impact for Indian professionals wanting to work in the United States and Indian IT services companies will be the permanent changes that the president is ordering, such as the way H-1B applicants are selected from among the hundreds of thousands that apply.The electronic lottery system, which is used to pick the 85,000 successful applicants from the total number of applicants that was three times more last year at 225,000, will now be replaced by a merit-based system that will prioritize the highest salaried applicants to “get the best and the brightest”, a senior Trump administration official told reporters in a background briefing ahead the issuance of the order.“So the top 85 (thousand) salary offers among the 225,000 or so applicants for those visas will get those visas,” the official added.President Trump has been calling for reforms in the H-1B visa programme to attract the best and brightest, echoing immigration hardliners who have argued that the present system is being abused to bring foreign workers on low wages to displace Americans, instead of attracting the really talented as its original mandate.The Trump administration will also seek to plug a “loophole” in the existing H-1B programme that allowed companies to hire foreign workers and then “domestically outsource” them to other companies, replacing their American workers. They do so by bypassing a rule prohibiting the hiring of a foreign worker if it directly led to the firing of an American worker. Outsourcing through a third-party system is critical to the business model of Indian IT services companies.The officials did not name any Indian companies, but did mention two American companies that have gone on to become controversial faces of this practice, Disney and AT&T. Most egregiously for the critics of this practice, Americans workers were forced to train the foreign workers who replaced them.“The President has instructed us to end that practice and will do so by regulation as soon as we possibly can,” said one of the officials who briefed reporters.The H-1B reforms will also include a change in the way the department of labor calculated prevailing wages so that foreign workers are in the upper end of the salary scale and don’t end up undercutting American workers. The labor department will also be empowered to investigate H-1B abuse.“Without regulatory language on changing the H-1B lottery to a system based on highest salary it is not possible to know whether such a regulation would be lawful and not struck down by a court,” said Stuart Andersen, whose non-partisan think tank National Foundation for American Policy closely tracks immigration issues, of the proposed changes in the H-1B selection system.The text or the timing of the regulation is not known.About the suspension of H-1B and other work visas, Andersen said, “it will encourage companies to conduct more work outside the United States and are much more likely to harm the US economic recovery than to aid it”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/largest-beneficiary-india-to-be-hit-hard-by-overhaul/story-L9WdsswOuktMhveqKGUweO.html
24-06-2020||India||Ladakh’s Pangong Fingers emerge as key focal point in India-China talks||While a “mutual consensus to disengage” from “all friction areas” along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) was reached during a meeting between Indian and Chinese commanders on Monday, it is the restoration of status quo ante in the Finger Area on the north bank of Ladakh’s Pangong Tso lake that will determine the success of efforts to cool tensions along the contested border, officials and China watchers said on Tuesday.The People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has set up permanent bunkers, pillboxes and observation posts between Fingers Four and Eight and getting it to pull down those structures and move back to their original positions at Finger Eight will be the toughest part of the disengagement process, said an official asking not to be named.The Finger Area refers to a set of eight cliffs jutting out of the Sirijap range that overlooks the Pangong lake. Before Chinese forces occupied vantage positions on Finger Four in early May, Indian Army soldiers would patrol right up to Finger Eight, which New Delhi considers to be its territory, said another official asking not to be named. The new Chinese positions have restricted the scope of Indian patrols. Fingers Four and Eight are eight kilometers apart. Satellite imagery shows that several of these positions came up after the current round of border tensions erupted on May 5-6.The Indian claim line in this sector extends to Finger Eight, while the Chinese claim is up to Finger Four till where PLA has constructed a vehicle track.“Getting PLA to pull back from Finger Four to Finger Eight will be a huge challenge. Their intentions can be discerned from their military posturing in the sector and the new positions and structures that have come up,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).The army is concerned about PLA’s presence in the Finger Area, especially its activities between Finger Four and Finger Eight over the last seven weeks. “It is not just about the Finger Area. You could next see PLA creating the same situation in Depsang, Chumar, Demchok and areas in the eastern sector on the basis of their perception of the border,” Hooda said.The Finger Area was the only sector, where limited disengagement did not begin after the two sides reached an understanding to implement a de-escalation plan to ease rising tensions along the border during a meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders. The area has been at the centre of the weeks-long border standoff between India and China that has plunged the bilateral relationship to a new low.“The PLA has entrenched itself in the Finger Area. It will be the biggest challenge that the disengagement process will encounter,” said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director-general of military operations. The modalities for disengagement from all friction areas were discussed at the meeting between senior Indian and Chinese commanders at Moldo on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pangong-fingers-emergeas-key-focal-point-in-talks/story-56NXogfl2qGTY4YpvV7NYP.html

On Sunday, an 85-year old bed-ridden man became Goa’s first Covid-19 casualty followed by a 58-year old man’s death. The latter had underlying heart conditions that aggravated his condition. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, however, sought to allay fears that the number of deaths would increase in the coming days. “Barring the two persons who have died, all the rest in Covid hospital are stable,” Sawant said while speaking to reporters on Monday. Goa’s coronavirus count mounted to 902 with the addition of 45 new cases on Monday, one less than the 46 cases recorded on Sunday and 19 less than the 64 cases registered on Saturday. The recent spate in Covid-19 infections has resulted in 462 cases per million ratio for Goa, the fourth highest in the country behind Ladakh, Delhi and Maharashtra. A former health minister, too, was found positive for the disease and moved to the Covid-19 Hospital on Monday night; his condition is said to be stable. 90% of Goa’s 705 cases have been registered in the month of June with the daily growth rate now comparable with much larger states.Goa’s 30-40 cases per day puts it in the same league as Jharkhand, which averaged around 60 cases per day and Chhattisgarh, averaging around 49 cases a day.Goa has, however, conducted a lot more tests, nearly 55,000, amounting to 30,000 tests per million people. Besides a dedicated Covid-19 Hospital, Goa has six Covid care centres where asymptomatic patients -- who make up around 95% of Goa’s all cases -- are being treated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-covid-19-deaths-in-two-days-darken-goa-s-mood-cm-says-nothing-to-worry/story-CGYdJsSo5WgB0tP72EWrBL.html

I come from a very humble background where every penny counted, so taking up acting was just beyond comprehension for my family. I was only ten when I went to a local ‘natak mandli’ and I remember they asked for Rs 20 for a month. How I managed those rupees is another story altogether, but from next month they let me join them for free as I was a very eager and hard-working kid,” said the actor.Reaching NSD (National School of Drama) was not an easy task for Boloram. “After being part of Kingdom of Dreams in Delhi for long I shifted my base to Mumbai in 2013. Luckily, I got an ad with none other than Amitabh (Bachchan) sir and it actually did make me stand out. Then I acted in numerous episodes of ‘Crime Patrol’ and got roles in films like ‘Badlapur Boys,’ ‘Haider’ and ‘Ok Jaanu,’ ‘Gabbar is Back’. I never thought of any role as big or small for me every role matter as I knew this will keep me in picture,” he said.For Boloram language has been no bar, telling more about this, he said, “Though I came from different language zone and my diction of Hindi was never that good. So, I knew that I have to overcome this and because of this I took up a job of a salesman so I get to move around in the city, meet people and just talk and talk. That actually helped me a lot. Today, I am comfortable in Hindi completely.”The diligent actor was in Lucknow in the beginning of the year to shoot for a film with actor Richa Chadha in lead. “The film, ‘Madam Chief Minister,’ has an ensemble cast and I am playing an important character. We all had a great time shooting there. Lucknow for me is a heaven of food. Being an Assamese I love non-vegetarian delicacies and the city of nawabs has a range of Mughlai dishes to savour on. I wish to come back and eat all that tasty stuff again.”With the ongoing crisis the film awaits a release. “It’s really tough time for the films that are all ready to release. Also, my next film ‘Om’ and another untitled film too are both complete. Seeing the current trend, we actors don’t mind a release on OTT as that is the best available option for now.” With his industry friends from various departments and his wife-actor Tina, he has come up with short film ‘Conditions Apply’ which got good appreciation on the digital platform.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/lucknow-for-me-is-a-food-heaven-boloram-das/story-E9NQi1645SWxhVujfJTqtK.html

Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said money collected for application from more than 230,000 pilgrims will be returned without cancellation deductions through direct transfer. The decision was taken after Saudi Arabia’s haj and umrah minister Mohammad Saleh bin Taher Benten asked India not to send pilgrims this year, he told reporters.“Honouring the decision of the Saudi Arabia government in view of serious challenges of Corona pandemic and keeping in mind the health and well-being of the people, it has been decided that Muslims from India will not go to Saudi Arabia to perform Haj,” the minister said. The Saudi Arabian government said it will place restrictions on foreign arrival for the Haj this year and allow only a limited number of Saudi citizens to make the pilgrimage with social distancing measures.“2.3 lakh applications had been received for Haj 2020. The process has been started today to immediately refund the full amount of money deposited by the applicant is without any deductions. The money will be refunded through online DBT mode into bank accounts of the applicants,” Naqvi tweeted.In 2018, the Union government allowed single woman to undertake the pilgrimage without a male escort. Around 2,300 women applied to perform Haj without a male companion this year and they will be allowed in 2021 on the basis of their application this year.Some 2.5 million pilgrims typically visit the holiest sites of Islam in Mecca and Medina for the week-long Haj, a once-in-a-lifetime duty for every able-bodied Muslim.

24-06-2020||India||MP trader misused passes in lockdown, police probe on||The Directorate General of GST Intelligence (DGGI) said it has unearthed an alleged goods and services tax (GST) evasion of over Rs 500 crore by chewing tobacco (pan masala and gutka) manufacturers, dealers, and distributors in Indore. Kishore Wadhwani, a trader who has been named one of the main accused in the case, allegedly used his media outlet to obtain curfew passes which were misused to transport gutka and cigarettes during the Covid-19 lockdown when only the transportation of essential goods was allowed, officials said on Tuesday. DGGI said in a statement that Wadhwani was arrested on June 15 and has been remanded to custody until June 30 in Indore. He has been booked for allegedly making fraudulent bills and using press stickers obtained from the district administration on vehicles used to transport gutka and tobacco, an official investigating the matter said on condition of anonymity.In the statement, DGGI’s Bhopal unit added that searches were conducted on the premises of gutka and tobacco dealers and distributors from June 9 to June 12, leading to the seizure of stocked non-GST paid pan masala and tobacco. The statement said the raids led to the detection of an estimated GST evasion of Rs 400 crore. “One of the masterminds and financial beneficiaries of the pan masala/tobacco GST evasion, who was arrested from Mumbai on June 15, was also found involved in manufacture and supply of cigarettes from a unit named M/s Ellora Tobacco Company Limited, Indore.”The statement said the unit has paid only Rs 3.55 crore over the last two financial years as GST. “Investigations conducted by DGGI has unearthed a major tax/ duty/ cess evasion estimated to be about Rs 105 crore only for the period from April 2019 to May 2020.” The statement added: “Hence the total revenue evasion, which would be clear only after completion of the investigation, is suspected to be multiple times higher. The tax evasion syndicate, in this case, involves directors of the company, transporters, supporting manufacturers, and raw material suppliers.”The statement said a number of accused were absconding and have not joined DGGI investigations. It added that a search at a factory of the company revealed a secret exit used to bring in unaccounted raw materials and toship out finished goods.The statement said DGGI located one of the clandestine and unregistered godowns used by the alleged tax evaders. It added there could be several other such undeclared godowns in and around Indore.The statement said Wadhwani started a media company and allegedly used it to “book fictitious advertising” to show income. DGGI additional director, PL Singh, declined comment and said he has nothing to add to the statement.Indore collector, Manish Singh, said the district administration issued passes to 500-600 traders during the lockdown but has nothing to do with any taxation.Wadhwani’s lawyer, Avinash M Sirpurkar, rejected the allegations against his client. “I am unable to understand how DGGI could unearth such a huge tax evasion during just five days of his remand. The charges regarding tax evasion against Wadhwani are completely baseless. Even if it is presumed that he indulged in tax evasion, it is a civil law matter related to GST, but Wadhwani was booked under the Indian Penal Code over alleged bills and press stickers just to harass him.”(With input from Neha Jain in Indore)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mp-trader-misused-passes-in-lockdown-police-probe-on/story-TVo5y1KLxB2E0p498gR7AK.html
24-06-2020||India||ICMR expands norms to enable rapid antibody, antigen testing||The Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) on Tuesday expanded the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) testing norms, advising that all hospitals, offices and public sector units be enabled to conduct rapid antibody tests, and recommending the deployment of rapid antigen tests in all containment zones, and hospitals and private labs across the state.While the antibody-based test can be used as a surveillance method to check if a person was infected by the Sars-CoV-2 virus at some point, tests through new “antigen” devices can be carried out on-site and provide results within 30 minutes. The rapid antigen tests were recently deployed in Delhi and have been hailed by experts for speeding up the test-trace-isolate process.“It is advised to enable all government and private Hospitals, offices, public sector units etc. to perform the antibody-based testing. This will help in allaying the fear and anxiety of health care workers, office employees etc..,” a statement released by ICMR said.“ICMR recommends deployment of the rapid antigen PoC (point of care) test in the following settings: i) All containment zones identified by the State Governments, ii) All Central & State Government Medical Colleges and Government hospitals, iii) All private hospitals approved by National Accreditation Board for Hospitals & Healthcare (NABH), iv) All private labs accredited by National Accreditation Board for Laboratories (NABL) and approved by ICMR as COVID-19 testing labs,” India’s apex biomedical research body said.The private sector welcomed the move. “We had raised the issue that we needed some clarity on whether we can perform antibody and antigen based tests. It’s good to know that government has come out with a revised advisory as it will be important to know how many have had exposure to the virus, especially in the health care sectors,” said Dr Anupam Sibal, group medical director, Apollo Hospitals. Speaking about the efficacy of the rapid antigen test, Dr Navin Dang said: “Antigen testing is point of care testing for time is of essence in conducting an antigen based test. It has to be done within an hour so if offices or other places have been allowed which means booths will have to be set-up on site itself. It is doable but modalities will have to be worked out so as to not compromise the sanctity of a sample.”An antigen is a molecule that induces an immune response within the body, especially the production of antibodies, and detecting its presence determines a present infection. Antigen-based tests ensure rapid diagnosis and they take about 30 minutes to present results, as opposed to nearly six hours taken by the RT-PCR test. It is a point-of-care test and does not require specialised laboratory facilities in terms of equipment, biosafety and biosecurity. It can be read through the naked eye without any specialised equipment.The research body said that all the positive results for any kind of Covid-19 test must be registered. “All data of testing needs to be entered into the ICMR portal on a real time basis…,” the advisory said.ICMR said in its statement that in an effort to ramp up testing capacity in the country, it has approved a total of 1,000 Covid-19 testing labs in public (730) and private (270) sectors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icmr-expands-norms-to-enable-rapid-antibody-antigen-testing/story-z7NWa16AV312NmifuWWMOJ.html
24-06-2020||India||Govt asks Patanjali to stop ads of Covid drug||The Union government has demanded clarification from Patanjali Ayurved, the company promoted by Baba Ramdev, over its claim of having developed a cure for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), and asked it to stop advertising the product till the claim is verified. The company announced its discovery in a press conference and Ramdev, a popular yoga guru, followed it up with a spate of interview to TV channels extolling the benefits of the cure, which, if it holds up to scientific scrutiny , will be the first of its kind in the world. “Facts of the claim and details of the stated scientific study are not known to the Ministry… Patanjali Ayurved Ltd has been asked to provide at the earliest details of the name and composition of the medicines being claimed for COVID treatment; site(s)/hospital(s), where the research study was conducted for Covid-19; protocol, sample size, Institutional Ethics Committee clearance, Clinical Trials Registry- India registration and results data of the study (ies)…,” said the ministry of Ayush (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) in a statement on Tuesday.According to Patanjali, the products have been made in association with privately-owned National Institute of Medical Science, Jaipur. The company also claimed the medicines cleared a clinical trial in several cities including Delhi, Ahmedabad and Meerut and the RCT (Randomized Clinical Trial) controlled with placebo at the Jaipur-based National Institute of Medical Sciences & Research. To be sure, no clinical testing data was released by the company. The approvals for manufacturing and marketing for the drugs named Coronil and Swasari have likely come from the licensing authority of Uttarakhand government, which is the state licensing authority for Patanjali in Haridwar. The Centre has asked the Uttarakhand government for details and also ordered Patanjali to stop advertising the products. “…and stop advertising/publicizing such claims till the issue is duly examined. Ministry has also requested concerned State Licensing Authority of Uttrakhand Government to provide copies of license and product approval details of the Ayurvedic medicines being claimed for the treatment of COVID -19,” the statement further read.In a press briefing held on Tuesday morning, Ramdev announced that its new drugs Coronil and Swasari will cure Covid-19, and that it has been proved through clinical trials. “We conducted a clinical case study and clinical controlled trial, and found 69 per cent patients recovered in three days and 100 patients recovered in seven days,” he said.The Ayush ministry has also warned Patanjali to stop misleading advertising till the results are verified.“The concerned Ayurvedic drug manufacturing company has been informed that such advertisements of drugs including Ayurvedic medicines are regulated under the provisions of Drugs and Magic Remedies (Objectionable Advertisements) Act, 1954 and Rules there under and the directives issued by the Central Government in the wake of COVID outbreak. Ministry had also issued a Gazette Notification dated 21st April, 2020 stating the requirements and the manner the research studies on COVID-19 with Ayush interventions/medicines should be undertaken.”An official in the Ayush ministry, on condition of anonymity said, “The central ministry wasn’t involved in the process, as health is a state subject the state regulators have the powers to grant approvals. The claim, however, needs to be verified now that it has come to our notice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-asks-patanjali-to-stop-ads-of-covid-drug/story-zPdLluK7AXOngR2Jn0qKWO.html
24-06-2020||India||Cheap steroid first life-saving drug in Covid fight, says study||The cheap and widely available steroid drug dexamethasone can save one in three critically ill coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients , according to the much awaited results of a scientific scrutiny by the University of Oxford published in a pre-print journal on Monday.Dexamethasone, a low-dose steroid that is manufactured in India and costs a few rupees, has been used for 60 years to treat inflammatory diseases and sceptic shock. India has approved the use glucocorticoid, which is another steroid with similar action, to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients in intensive care units (ICUs) who need ventilatory support. Results from the UK’s RECOVERY (Randomised Evaluation of COVid-19 thERapY) trial show the steroid reduced death by a third in hospitalised Covid-19 patients who needed invasive ventilator support to help them breathe, and by a fifth in those who needed oxygenation but not ventilation, when given as a 6mg dose per day for up to 10 days.Dexamethadose is the first treatment to prevent death from Covid-19. “Although (the antiviral) remdesivir has been shown to shorten the time to recovery in hospitalised patients, no therapeutic agents have been shown to reduce mortality,” said the report, published in medRxiv, a preprint server that publishes scientific studies before peer review to inform potentially lifesaving decisions.Both remdesivir and dexamethasone are manufactured in India.“The data is conclusive for moderately and severely sick ICU patients, especially for those very sick on ventilators. The drug will also be useful for those with difficulty breathing that needs oxygen constantly, despite proning,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, president, Public Health Foundation of India, and an independent expert on the World Health Organisation’s Global Executive Group of the Steering Committee on Solidarity trial.Proning refers to patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome who are asked to lie flat on their stomach with the chest down and the back up (prone position) during mechanical ventilation to improve oxygenation and reduce mortality.Scientists say Covid-19 is associated with diffuse lung damage, which makes corticosteroid an effective drug to help modulate immune-mediated lung injury and reduce its progression to respiratory failure and death.“I would generalise and say that as of now, our most effective strategy is in reducing the inflammatory response in the later stages of Covid-19. Steroids like dexamethasone seem to be partially effective. Other steroids (glucocorticoids) are already being used in India during this phase of the disease. Now there is evidence for effectiveness, which is important. I do not expect a difference between dexamethasone or other glucocorticoids at equivalent doses,” said Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, Council of Scientific and Industrial Research-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi.The Oxford group announced preliminary findings on June 16 in a press release, instead of a medical journal, which were welcomed by WHO but criticised by some as “science by press release” because the findings were announced without the trial data being shared for scientific scrutiny. RECOVERY halted the dexamethasone arm of the trial on June 8 after the drug showed significant benefits in a sufficient number of patients.The RECOVERY trial, which enrolled 11,500 patients from at least 175 hospitals in the UK in March to test a range of potential treatments for Covid-19, last month suspended the hydroxychloroquine arm of the trial after it found the anti-malaria drug did not benefit patients.Dexamethasone, however, was not found to benefit hospitalised Covid-19 patients not receiving respiratory support, with “results consistent with possible harm in this group,” according to the RECOVERY trial data.“The important caution is that it would worsen the disease if used too early,” said Dr Agarwal.WHO on Monday called for a rapid increase in the production of the steroid. “Although the data is still preliminary, the recent findings that the steroid dexamethasone has life-saving potential for critically ill Covid-19 patients gave us a much-needed reason to celebrate,” WHO director-general Dr Adhanom Ghebreyesus Tedros said at the health agency’s daily virtual briefing on Monday.“The next challenge is to increase production and rapidly and equitably distribute dexamethasone worldwide, focusing on where it is needed most. Demand has already surged, following the UK trial results showing dexamethasone’s clear benefit,” he added. WHO also cautioned that dexamethasone must only be used for patients with severe or critical disease, under close clinical supervision. “There is no evidence that the drug works for patients with mild disease or as a preventative measure, and it could cause harm,” said Dr Tedros.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cheap-steroid-first-life-saving-drug-in-covid-fight-says-study/story-hybZueMT9lv8I1CsiTYmiP.html
24-06-2020||India||Puri Jagannath Rath Yatra begins||For the first time in its history, the famous Rath Yatra of the Jagannath temple in Puri, Odisha, began on Tuesday morning with priests pulling the three colourful chariots of the presiding deities in the absence of the tens of thousands of devotees who typically throng the town every year for the annual event.Around 1,500 priests of the iconic 12th century temple milled around the wooden chariots which they started pulling from the main temple to the Gundicha temple amid the beating of cymbals and drums in praise of the resident deities: Lord Jagannath, Lord Balabhadra and Goddess Subhadra. The pulling of the chariots -- Nandighosh, Taladwaja and Darpadalana -- is the main ritual of the festival. It was performed by the priests who had been tested for Covid-19 on Monday.The Supreme Court on Monday allowed the conduct of the Rath Yatra, recalling its June 18 order that prohibited the event, but laid down strict conditions, including a ban on pubic attendance and the imposition of a curfew in Puri during the festivities.  The festival was telecast on Doordarshan. The erstwhile King of Puri, Gajapati Dibyasingha Deb, who is also the first servitor of the Lord, performed the Chhera Panhara, a ritual sweeping of the chariots, before they were pulled by the priests. “It’s hard to imagine Rath Yatra without devotees on Badadanda (Grand Road). But Lord Jagannath stepped out of temple for the whole universe,” said Deb. Puri Govardhan Peeth Shankaracharya Nischalananda Saraswati paid obeisance to the deities atop the chariots along with his disciples.Until Monday afternoon, uncertainty clouded the Rath Yatra as a three-judge bench of the apex court led by chief justice SA Bobde heard dozens of intervention petitions seeking recall of the court’s June 18 order that stayed the festival over fears of a mass congregation amid the coronavirus disease pandemic. For a few days, it seemed that the Rath Yatra would not be held for the first time in 285 years.The judges on Monday afternoon reversed their decision after an appeal by the petitioners as well as an affidavit by the state and the Centre arguing that the event had been held continuously for centuries, and even in 1918, when the world was in the grip of the Spanish flu. The apex court agreed to allow the festival subject to conditions. Since Tuesday morning, the district administration disinfected the 2.5 km long road from the main temple to Gundicha temple ahead of the pulling of chariots. From 9 pm Monday, the police enforced a curfew around the holy town restricting anyone’s entry or exit for the following 41 hours. “We have mobilised 50 platoons of forces in Puri with two primary objectives – smooth and incident-free movement / pulling of the chariots from origin to destination and restricting entry of unauthorised persons into the town,” said state director general of police (DGP) Abhay, who goes by one name.The devotees, who are an intrinsic part of the festival, remained glued to TV sets as Doordarshan telecast the proceedings live. “It’s all the wish of Lord Jagannath. I am happy with the decision of the Supreme Court. I will see my Lord after the lockdown is over,” said Binapani Mallik, a housewife in Bhubaneswar.“After the SC order last week, I had given up hope. But I knew that the Lord of Universe would perform a miracle to come out on the road and show his face to his millions of devotees,” said Prabodh Mishra, a septuagenarian.On Monday, 1,143 servitors of the temple were tested for Covid-19 and one tested positive. The servitor who tested positive was shifted to a Covid hospital before the beginning of the Rath Yatra rituals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puri-jagannath-rath-yatra-begins/story-PR5eYbVKQS2xVxZHA92fPK.html
24-06-2020||India||US puts restrictions on Vande Bharat Mission flights||The US administration has imposed restrictions  on Air India’s repatriation flights for Indians stranded in the United States in the aftermath of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, saying the Indian government has been engaging in discriminatory treatment of American airlines by barring them from operating similar flights. India said it was studying requests by other countries, including the US, to operate such flights.An order issued by the US department of transport on Monday said the directive would take effect in 30 days. The order said the US had taken the action after Indian authorities didn’t address American concerns about “restrictive and discriminatory treatment of US carriers” that were first raised on May 19.The order said Air India will have to file applications for authorisation for repatriation flights at least 30 days before the date of the proposed flight.   “We have received requests from concerned authorities in several countries including the US, France, Germany among others requesting that their air carriers be allowed to participate in the transportation of passengers along the line being conducted by Air India under Vande Bharat Mission. These requests are being examined,” he civil aviation ministry said in a statement.“We have also had one round of negotiations with US on 15 June 2020 with representatives of US Department of Transportation and US Embassy on this issue. They were invited to submit precise proposals in this respect. A communication has now been received on 19 June, 2020 detailing these requests.” “As we move from controlled and managed aviation evacuation of our citizens in different parts of the world and foreign nationals from India, we are now looking at the possibility of establishing bilateral arrangements... As we contemplate further opening up in response to demands, we are looking at the prospect of establishing individual bilateral bubbles, India-US, India-France, India-Germany, India-UK. These are all destinations where demand for travel has not diminished. Final decisions pursuant to negotiations are expected to be taken soon,” the statement added.India plans to operate a total of 96 flights to various cities in the US between June 12 and July 2 under the third phase of the Vande Bharat Mission, the country’s largest repatriation programme for Indian nationals stranded abroad because of the Covid-19 pandemic. These flights won’t be affected by the order.India significantly ramped up flights to the US and Canada in the second and third phases of the Vande Bharat Mission to being back stranded citizens, including students and professionals who lost their jobs because of the economic fallout of the pandemic.The US order said Air India was being notified that it “will be required, effective 30 days after the service date of this Order, to obtain prior approval from the Department…before operating any Third- and/or Fourth-Freedom charter flights to or from the United States”.“We are taking this action because the Government of India (GoI) has impaired the operating rights of US carriers and has engaged in discriminatory and restrictive practices with respect to US carrier services to and from India,” it said.Air India is currently the only foreign air carrier from India that has authorisation from the US department of transport to operate flights to and from the US with its own aircraft and crew. Air India’s permit authorises it to fly scheduled and chartered flights.The order contended that the Indian side imposed restrictions that prevent US carriers from making full use of charter rights as they have been barred from conducting passenger charter operations “involving direct sales to individual passengers or through other distribution systems”. It added that the US hasn’t placed any limitations on Air India’s charter operations.Air India has been conducting repatriation flights to the US since May 18. “On May 19, 2020, an official from the Department [of transport] advised Air India of the Department’s concerns that some, if not all, of Air India’s so-called evacuation charters have gone beyond true evacuations (at least on the India to the United States segments) and involved sales to any member of the general public able to enter the United States,” the order said.Delta Air Lines sought permission from India on May 26 to perform repatriation charter services but has not received approval, the order said. The order also accused Air India of using the repatriation charter flights “as a way of circumventing the GoI-imposed prohibition of all scheduled services” since March 25.“This situation, in which Indian airlines are permitted to perform services pursuant to their rights under the Agreement while US carriers are not, creates a competitive disadvantage for US carriers vis-à-vis Indian carriers...,” it said, adding the US embassy had first registered its objections with the Indian government on May 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-puts-restrictions-on-vande-bharat-mission-flights/story-9Qp4aVmAVQKOVZTzX65tJM.html

Active Covid 19 cases in Mumbai stand at 29,982.Maharashtra on the other hand, kept the trend of reporting more than 3,000 Covid -19 cases per day as seen for the entire last week, by recording 3,214 new infections on Tuesday, taking the state tally to 1,39,010 with 62,833 active cases.The worst affected Indian state by Covid-19, also reported 248 deaths on Tuesday, including 75 registered in the last 48 hours and the remaining being backlogged from the last few weeks. The addition has taken the state death toll to 6,531 and the case fatality rate to 4.69%. The recovery rate, however, has improved to 50.09% with the discharge of a total of 69,631 patients till date. The data was released by the state health department on Tuesday.The additional 1,328 deaths added last Tuesday on account of reconciliation of past data, made the death toll in the state jump by 2,403 in the last eight days. This resulted in the case fatality rate zooming to 4.69% on Tuesday from 3.79% on June 15. The positivity rate in the state has risen multifold over the last few weeks. It was 27.45 % on Monday, an increase of close to 5 percentage points from 22.49 % recorded a month ago on May 22, and over 21% more than the meager 6.06% recorded on April 22. The positivity rate in Mumbai, too, has seen a rising trend. From 8.67% on April 21, the positivity rate in the metropolitan increased to 27.9% on May 21 and 27.5% on June 21. Also Read: 40,300 cyber attacks in the last 4-5 days from China, more coming: Maharashtra cyber departmentThe test positivity rate is the percentage of tests that turn out to be positive for SARS-CoV-2. Maharashtra has so far conducted 7.87 lakhs tests, including 2.92 lakh in Mumbai alone. Dr Avinash Supe, former KEM dean and member of the expert committee appointed by the state to recommend steps to curb the spread said, “As per the ICMR guidelines the tests are being performed on the symptomatic cases and hence the rate naturally ought to be high. When the tests are done for all contacts, the positivity rate is low.”When asked if the high positivity rate is an indication of the community transmission, Dr Supe said, “It is a controversial subject, some epidemiologists say it’s already begun, some say no it hasn’t. The possibility of it (having begun) is high, but it is the matter of research by scientists and experts.” He added that though the case fatality rate is high, it is still within limits and barring a few areas, the situation in Mumbai is improving. Also Read: Ajit Pawar says there could a sharp rise in Covid cases in MaharashtraHowever, experts also point out that the high positivity rate also indicates that the state is only testing the sick and not casting the net wide to know if the virus is spreading within communities. 6,05,141 people are currently home quarantined in the state, while 26,572 patients are under institutional quarantine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mumbai-reports-only-824-new-cases-in-24-hours-lowest-in-last-40-days/story-yYZvHpBgmviH4qpz49YCNL.html
24-06-2020||India||TMC under fire after alleged corruption in cyclone relief sparks violence||Violence was reported from two places in West Bengal following allegations of corruption in distribution of compensation for those affected by cyclone Amphan, police said Tuesday.The allegations of corruption were raised against local Trinamool Congress (TMC) panchayat leaders.A panchayat office and the home of a TMC leader were ransacked by the party’s supporters at Sagar in South 24 Parganas district on Monday morning while the office of the community block development officer (BDO) at Deganga in the adjoining North 24 Parganas district was vandalised late in the night.Fifteen people, including some college students, were arrested in Deganga on charges of vandalism and blocking Taki Road, the main highway in the area, for several hours, police said.Samit Mondal, inspector-in-charge of Deganga police station said, “Five of the accused were sent to police remand by the local court this afternoon. They have been charged with destruction of public property, including police vehicles, blocking roads and assaulting people. They are being brought to the police station for questioning.”In both incidents, villagers alleged that the sum of Rs 20,000 that the state government has sanctioned for repairing damaged houses was being given to people who are close to the ruling party and whose homes did not suffer any damage. They also alleged that people were not getting work under the MNREGA projects.“The violence at Deganga was planned and perpetrated by Naxalite elements with help from the BJP. Two TMC panchayat samity members were assaulted,” said state food and supplies minister and TMC district president Jyotipriyo Mullick. “The agitation had no link with politics. Many of us are supporters of TMC as well,” said Waziruddin Mullick, a local villager. BJP’s Bengal unit chief Dilip Ghosh alleged that thousands of TMC panchayat leaders are involved in corruption and this began with distribution of free ration during the Covid-19 lockdown.“People are revolting now because they have run out of patience. The food minister’s allegations against the BJP are baseless,” Ghosh told the media on Tuesday.“We witnessed looting of ration during the lockdown. Now it has spread to relief work in Amphan-hit districts,” said Sujan Chakraborty, CPI(M) legislator and leader of the Left parties in the state Assembly.Referring to the incident at Sagar in South 24 Parganas, Sunderbans affairs minister Manturam Pakhira said the administration would look into the allegations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tmc-under-fire-after-alleged-corruption-in-cyclone-relief-sparks-violence/story-0cwD8iTWtKMCk5cxRZxU8N.html

It also reported 68 new deaths in the same period, taking the death toll to 2,301 since the outbreak of the disease. The city-state currently has 24,988 active coronavirus cases.The capital has also crossed 4 lakh tests conducted in the city to detect Covid-19 patients with tests conducted on 16,952 samples in the last 24 hours, according to the health bulletin.Delhi is tasked with a major challenge to ramp up its medical infrastructure in the wake of the rising Covid cases, expected to cross 5.5 lakh by the end of July by one estimate, requiring close to 90,000 beds. The health bulletin on Tuesday didn’t give any information on the number of beds currently available at the disposal of the authorities for treatment of coronavirus patients.The departure from normal practice comes on a day when the Union home minister Amit Shah and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal exchanged tweets over a new facility created for temporary use as a Covid-19 treatment centre.It all started with Kejriwal requesting Amit Shah to inspect the facility with 10,000 beds and to deploy doctors and nurses from ITBP and Army to the facility. It invited a retort from Shah, who said that the decision to operationalise the centre had been taken three days ago in a meeting attended both by Shah and Kejriwal apart from other officials while taking stock of Delhi’s preparedness.He also reminded the Delhi CM that the centre erected at Radha Swami Beas facility in south Delhi will be run by Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP).“Dear Kejriwal ji, it has already been decided in our meeting three days back and MHA has assigned work of operating 10,000 bed COVID Care Centre at Radha Swami Beas in Delhi to ITBP. Work is in full swing and a large part of the facility will be operational by June 26,” Shah said in a tweet, which was seen as a counter to Kejriwal.Shah also announced that another 1,000 bed hospital with 250 ICU beds was being prepared to be operationalised in the next 10 days. This facility, he added, will be managed by armed forces personnel.An expert committee set up to aid the government’s Covid-19 containment efforts had earlier this month claimed that Delhi will need 15,000 beds by the end of June and around 42,000 by mid-July. It also estimated that the number of positive cases in Delhi will touch the 100,000 mark by the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-4-000-new-covid-19-cases-take-delhi-tally-past-66-600/story-YnDtpoLUOwGVEqUpLll57H.html
24-06-2020||Editorials||India’s Pakistan dilemma | HT Editorial||India has downgraded its diplomatic relationship with Pakistan. It has told the Pakistani high commission in Delhi to reduce its strength by half, on the grounds that officials were supporting “cross-border violence and terrorism”. Given the reciprocity that governs diplomatic ties, India will do the same in Pakistan. This comes soon after India expelled two Pakistani high commission officials for spying, and Pakistani agencies detained and harassed two members of the Indian diplomatic mission in Islamabad. Since August, when India decided to change the constitutional status of Jammu and Kashmir (J&K), the two countries have also not had high commissioners in each other’s country. New Delhi’s recent decision is the first time after the 2001 Parliament attack that it has downgraded ties to this level. But the tit-for-tat diplomatic battle hides beneath it a real dilemma in India’s Pakistan policy. On one hand it is a clear, well-recognised, fact. Pakistan is a State that sponsors terrorism and engages in asymmetric warfare against India. It has, directly through its military-intelligence nexus, given patronage to terror groups that have conducted attacks, leading to huge loss of Indian lives. Pakistan continues to cause violence and instability in J&K — an integral part of India. It engages in mass disinformation campaigns against India internationally. And it is an “all-weather friend” of China, which has stepped up its offensive against India — perhaps even in close consultation with Islamabad. In this backdrop, even continuing with diplomatic niceties and talking to Pakistan appears futile. At the same time, Pakistan is a neighbour. Its alliance with China poses a threat, for it can lead to an adversarial “two-front” situation — which Indian policymakers have factored in, but must be avoided for the costs involved. Countering Pakistan’s disinformation campaigns is also a distraction from India’s core diplomatic goals. And not talking at all — and downgrading diplomatic ties — will not make the situation better. This then is the dilemma. The United Progressive Alliance government talked, hoping it would embolden constituencies of peace and lead to a breakthrough. It did not work. For the most part, the Narendra Modi government has not talked. It hasn’t worked either. There are no easy solutions. But at the minimum, diplomatic channels of some sort must remain intact to handle unforeseen situations, as well as the other elements of the relationship, including people-to-people ties. India must think more creatively about its legitimate Pakistan dilemma.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/india-s-pakistan-dilemma/story-CYFdgg8j8HeSJyGPGhVI7I.html

The list of 41 mines included several blocks located in forest-rich areas of Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Odisha and Maharashtra. Three Opposition-ruled states — Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand — have expressed reservations against the decision. Maharashtra’s environment minister, Aaditya Thackeray, spoke about the loss of biodiversity and wildlife; Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren, whose government has moved the Supreme Court against the order, raised the issue of displacement ; and Chhattisgarh forest minister Mohammad Akbar spoke about increasing human-elephant conflicts.Mineral resources are key to India’s development, and auctions generate huge funds. The government has also done well in making the auction process more transparent. At the same time, mining causes displacement; disturbs forests and wildlife; dries up or contaminates water sources; affects health; increases human-animal conflict, and deepens the climate crisis. This is why a calibrated approach is essential when it comes to the use of natural resources in general, and mining in particular. It is important to listen to stakeholders — states, affected gram sabhas (which have a say, as per Supreme Court’s 2013 order in the Vedanta case) and civil society groups. This can help plan a sustainable way forward that balances development and the protection of India’s under-stress biodiversity and wildlife. The Centre must listen more, and Opposition states must not politicise the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-centre-must-listen-to-all-stakeholders-on-coal-mining/story-tITnfFWR4JWibrT8TlUaCP.html
24-06-2020||Editorials||Don’t fix what’s not broken | HT Editorial||In the middle of a long and arduous battle with Covid-19, meddling with successful and globally established health protocols on how to manage the pandemic is an ill-advised step. A case in point is the needless flip-flop in the national Capital in recent days over one practice that has clearly been working well, not just in the city but across nations — home isolation for mild and pre-symptomatic cases. While Covid-19 is a deadly and life-threatening disease, it does not affect everyone in the same manner. A large number of patients develop no or mild symptoms, and can be treated at home with proper monitoring and care. The idea to keep them at home — given they have isolation space so as to not infect others, and a caregiver who can cater to their basic needs — is to keep the hospital beds, health centres and institutional isolation facilities free for people who really require them. This stops the health system from being overrun, particularly in a country such as India where resources are inadequate at the best of times.In this universally acknowledged backdrop, on June 19, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), which is chaired by the lieutenant-governor, ordered that all patients, irrespective of their condition, must be kept in an institutional facility for at least five days. While DDMA said the idea was to stop the spread in densely populated communities, data till last week showed that of more than 27,000 patients who were in home isolation in Delhi, only 1,618 (or 6%) had to be shifted to hospitals, while the rest had either successfully recovered or were on the road to recovery. The order led to legitimate criticism. The Delhi government questioned the rationale behind it; the district administration said it would be unable to handle the extra flow of patients; and health officials complained of the lack of facilities and the additional load on care workers.The order was corrected the next day and status quo was restored with one major change — a mandatory first-examination at a government care centre for all those who test positive. But this revised framework with mandatory examination has already added to the pressure on health infrastructure in the city (the patients, for instance, are to be ferried to the centres in ambulances), with the Delhi government now asking for a reversal to the old system in which a medical team visited homes. As Covid-19 cases rise, home isolation will be key in battling the crisis while keeping the health system robust. The government and DDMA must develop a consistent, coherent framework, work on strengthening protocols and monitoring, and go back to the old system. Don’t fix what’s not broken.(This piece has been edited to reflect, more accurately, the original decision of the DDMA)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/don-t-fix-what-s-not-broken/story-y2oxgJPb6cvDtOgNw0tJIK.html
